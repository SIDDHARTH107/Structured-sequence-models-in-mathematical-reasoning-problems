Substitute this expression into the wave equation and solve for $k$ and $\\omega$ in terms of $c$. Then, use the principle of superposition to construct the general solution as a linear combination of such exponential solutions.",
    "message_2": "Let's follow the hint and assume a solution of the form:\n\n$u(x,t) = A e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}$\n\nNow, we need to find the second partial derivatives of $u$ with respect to $t$ and $x$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = A e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}(-\\omega^2)$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = A e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}(k^2)$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the wave equation:\n\n$A e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}(-\\omega^2) = c^2 A e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}(k^2)$\n\nSince $A e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}$ is nonzero, we can divide both sides by it:\n\n$-\\omega^2 = c^2 k^2$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\omega$ in terms of $k$ and $c$:\n\n$\\omega = \\pm ck$\n\nNow that we have the relationship between $\\omega$ and $k$, we can write the general solution as a linear combination of exponential solutions using the principle of superposition:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [A(k) e^{i(kx - ck t)} + B(k) e^{i(kx + ck t)}] dk$\n\nHere, $A(k)$ and $B(k)$ are complex-valued functions of the wave number $k$, which can be determined from initial or boundary conditions. This is the general solution to the wave equation in terms of complex exponentials."
