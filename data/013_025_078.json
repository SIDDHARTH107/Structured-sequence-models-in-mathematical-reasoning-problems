    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a math student to solve related to Traveler's Dilemma:\n\nImagine a scenario where two travelers, A and B, have each been given a letter containing a number between 2 and 100. They are told to independently decide on a number and write it down. The traveler who writes down the lower number gets the number they wrote down as a prize, while the other traveler gets the higher number minus $2. For example, if A writes 10 and B writes 20, A gets 10 as a prize and B gets 18 as a prize. If both travelers write the same number, they each get that number as a prize.\n\nAssume that both travelers use the same strategy and base their number choices on the Traveler's Dilemma. What number should they write down to maximize their prize?\n\nHint: The Traveler's Dilemma strategy involves considering the other player's likely choices and trying to predict what the other player will do.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use backward induction. We start by considering the highest possible number, which is 100. If one traveler chooses 100, the other traveler can choose 99 and get 99 as a prize, while the first traveler gets 98 (100 - 2). So, choosing 100 is not the best strategy.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when one traveler chooses 99. If the other traveler chooses 98, they get 98 as a prize, and the first traveler gets 97 (99 - 2). So, choosing 99 is also not the best strategy.\n\nWe can continue this process, and we will find that choosing a lower number is always better than choosing a higher number. However, we also need to consider the minimum number, which is 2.\n\nIf one traveler chooses 2, the other traveler can choose 2 as well, and they both get 2 as a prize. In this case, both travelers are using the same strategy, and they are both choosing the lowest possible number.\n\nSo, the best strategy for both travelers to maximize their prize is to choose the lowest possible number, which is 2."
