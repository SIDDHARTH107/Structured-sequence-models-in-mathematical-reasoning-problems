For one week, they recorded the temperature and the number of ice cream cones sold per day. The data is shown below:\n\nTemperature (°F) - Ice cream cones sold\n90 - 120\n85 - 110\n80 - 100\n75 - 90\n70 - 80\n65 - 70\n60 - 60\n\nUsing causal logic, what is the predicted number of ice cream cones sold when the temperature is 72°F?",
    "message_2": "To predict the number of ice cream cones sold at 72°F, we can first find the linear relationship between the temperature and the number of ice cream cones sold. We can do this by finding the slope and the y-intercept of the line.\n\nLet x be the temperature in °F and y be the number of ice cream cones sold.\n\nFirst, we can find the average of the temperatures (x values) and the average of the ice cream cones sold (y values):\n\nx_avg = (90 + 85 + 80 + 75 + 70 + 65 + 60) / 7 = 525 / 7 = 75\ny_avg = (120 + 110 + 100 + 90 + 80 + 70 + 60) / 7 = 630 / 7 = 90\n\nNext, we can find the slope (m) of the line:\n\nm = Σ((x - x_avg)(y - y_avg)) / Σ((x - x_avg)^2)\n\nFor each data point, we can calculate (x - x_avg)(y - y_avg) and (x - x_avg)^2:\n\nTemperature (°F) - Ice cream cones sold - (x - x_avg)(y - y_avg) - (x - x_avg)^2\n90 - 120 - (15)(30) = 450 - 225\n85 - 110 - (10)(20) = 200 - 100\n80 - 100 - (5)(10) = 50 - 25\n75 - 90 - (0)(0) = 0 - 0\n70 - 80 - (-5)(-10) = -50 - 25\n65 - 70 - (-10)(-20) = -200 - 100\n60 - 60 - (-15)(-30) = -450 - 225\n\nNow, we can find the sum of these values:\n\nΣ((x - x_avg)(y - y_avg)) = 450 + 200 + 50 + 0 - 50 - 200 - 450 = 0\nΣ((x - x_avg)^2) = 225 + 100 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 100 + 225 = 700\n\nSince the sum of (x - x_avg)(y - y_avg) is 0, the slope (m) is 0:\n\nm = 0 / 700 = 0\n\nThis means that there is no linear relationship between the temperature and the number of ice cream cones sold. Therefore, we cannot predict the number of ice cream cones sold at 72°F using causal logic and linear regression."
