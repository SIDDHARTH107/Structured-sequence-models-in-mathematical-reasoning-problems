    "message_2": "To find the scalar curvature of the surface, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start with the first fundamental form.\n\nThe tangent vectors are:\n∂x/∂u = (cos(v), sin(v), 1/u)\n∂x/∂v = (-u*sin(v), u*cos(v), 0)\n\nNow, we compute the metric tensor (first fundamental form) components:\nE = <∂x/∂u, ∂x/∂u> = cos^2(v) + sin^2(v) + 1/u^2\nF = <∂x/∂u, ∂x/∂v> = 0\nG = <∂x/∂v, ∂x/∂v> = u^2\n\nNow, let's compute the second fundamental form. We need the unit normal vector N:\nN = (∂x/∂u × ∂x/∂v) / |∂x/∂u × ∂x/∂v|\nN = (1/u, 0, -u) / sqrt(1 + u^2)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form components:\nL = <∂²x/∂u², N> = -1/u^3\nM = <∂²x/∂u∂v, N> = 0\nN = <∂²x/∂v², N> = -u\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / 2(EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,0,0), we have u = 1 and v = 0. So, the first and second fundamental forms become:\nE = 2, F = 0, G = 1\nL = -1, M = 0, N = -1\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\nK = (-1 - 0) / (2 - 0) = -1/2\nH = (-1 + (-1) - 2*0) / 2(2 - 0) = -1\n\nFinally, we can compute the scalar curvature R:\nR = 2H - K = 2*(-1) - (-1/2) = -3/2\n\nSo, the scalar curvature of the surface at the point (1,0,0) is -3/2."
