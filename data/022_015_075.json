    "message_2": "The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in the upper half-plane and continuous on the real axis, then its reflection across the real axis is also analytic in the lower half-plane. Moreover, the function and its reflection agree on the real axis.\n\nGiven f(z) = z^3 for Im(z) > 0, we want to find f(z) for Im(z) < 0. Let's first find the reflection of f(z) across the real axis. To do this, we replace z with its complex conjugate, denoted as z*.\n\nf(z*) = (z*)^3\n\nNow, we want to find the function that agrees with f(z) on the real axis and with f(z*) in the lower half-plane. Since f(z) is real on the x-axis, we have:\n\nf(z) = f(z*) for Im(z) = 0\n\nSo, we can define the function g(z) as follows:\n\ng(z) = f(z) for Im(z) > 0\ng(z) = f(z*) for Im(z) < 0\n\nNow, g(z) is the function we are looking for. It is analytic in the upper half-plane, agrees with f(z) on the real axis, and is the reflection of f(z) in the lower half-plane. Thus, we have:\n\ng(z) = z^3 for Im(z) > 0\ng(z) = (z*)^3 for Im(z) < 0\n\nThis is the function f(z) extended to the lower half-plane using the Schwarz reflection principle."
