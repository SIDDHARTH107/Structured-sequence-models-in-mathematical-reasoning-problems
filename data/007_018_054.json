    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than one million, we need to find the first pair of primes that are both greater than one million and have the smallest difference between them.\n\nUsing a prime number generator or a prime number checking algorithm, we can find the following consecutive prime numbers greater than one million:\n\n1,000,300 and 1,000,313\n\nThe difference between these two prime numbers is:\n\n1,000,313 - 1,000,300 = 13\n\nTherefore, the length of the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than one million is 13."
