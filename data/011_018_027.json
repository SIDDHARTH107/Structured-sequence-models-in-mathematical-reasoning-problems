Additionally, how many ways can the teacher choose 6 students to represent the class in a math contest if each team must have at least one representative?",
    "message_2": "To divide the 18 students into teams of 3, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students and k is the number of students in each team.\n\nSo, for the group project, we have C(18, 3) = 18! / (3!(18-3)!) = 18! / (3!15!) = 816 different teams of 3 students.\n\nNow, for the math contest, we need to choose 6 students with at least one representative from each team. Since we have 816 teams, we can think of this as choosing 2 extra students from the remaining 15 students (18 - 3 = 15) after forming a team of 3.\n\nSo, we have C(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15-2)!) = 15! / (2!13!) = 105 ways to choose 2 extra students.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to form a team of 3 with the number of ways to choose 2 extra students: 816 * 105 = 85,680 ways to choose 6 students to represent the class in a math contest with at least one representative from each team."
