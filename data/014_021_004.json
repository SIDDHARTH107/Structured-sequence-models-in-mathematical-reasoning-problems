    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept the following ciphertext encrypted using a Hill cipher: VYXO, and you know that the plaintext is a four letter word consisting only of lowercase English letters. The encryption key matrix used was a 2x2 matrix with determinant 11. Can you determine the plaintext? If so, what is it?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext VYXO using the Hill cipher, we need to find the inverse of the encryption key matrix modulo 26. Since we know the determinant of the key matrix is 11, we can find its inverse determinant (also called the modular multiplicative inverse) modulo 26.\n\nThe modular multiplicative inverse of a number x modulo m is a number y such that (x * y) % m = 1. In our case, we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 modulo 26.\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 modulo 26. The algorithm gives us the inverse of 11 modulo 26 as 19, since (11 * 19) % 26 = 1.\n\nNow, let's denote the encryption key matrix as K and its inverse as K_inv. Since the determinant of K is 11, the determinant of K_inv will be the modular multiplicative inverse of 11, which is 19.\n\nLet K = | a b |\n          | c d |\n\nThen, K_inv = (1/det(K)) * |  d  -b |\n                                      | -c   a |\n\nSince det(K) = 11, det(K_inv) = 19. Therefore, we have:\n\nK_inv = (1/19) * |  d  -b |\n                         | -c   a |\n\nNow, we need to find the values of a, b, c, and d modulo 26. Since we are working with modulo 26, we can multiply each element of K_inv by the modular multiplicative inverse of 19 (which is also 19) to get the integer values of a, b, c, and d.\n\nK_inv = 19 * |  d  -b |\n                  | -c   a |\n\nLet's denote the ciphertext as C and the plaintext as P. The Hill cipher decryption process can be represented as:\n\nP = K_inv * C\n\nFirst, we need to convert the ciphertext VYXO into numerical values using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). VYXO corresponds to the numerical values (21, 24, 23, 14).\n\nNow, we can represent the ciphertext as a column vector:\n\nC = | 21 |\n      | 24 |\n      | 23 |\n      | 14 |\n\nSince we don't know the exact key matrix, we cannot determine the exact plaintext. However, we can provide a general solution for the plaintext P in terms of the unknown key matrix elements a, b, c, and d.\n\nP = K_inv * C\n\nP = | 19d  -19b | * | 21  23 | = | (19d * 21 - 19b * 23) % 26  (19d * 24 - 19b * 14) % 26 |\n      | -19c  19a |   | 24  14 |   | (-19c * 21 + 19a * 23) % 26 (-19c * 24 + 19a * 14) % 26 |\n\nOnce the key matrix is known, the plaintext can be calculated using the above formula."
