    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 5 players who can invest a maximum of $10 each into a common pool. The total amount invested in the pool is multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and then divided equally amongst all players, regardless of whether or not they invested. If everyone invests their maximum, what is the total payout for each player?",
    "message_2": "If everyone invests their maximum of $10 each, the total amount invested in the pool would be:\n\n5 players * $10/player = $50\n\nNext, we multiply the total amount invested by the factor of 1.5:\n\n$50 * 1.5 = $75\n\nNow, we divide the total amount after multiplication equally amongst all 5 players:\n\n$75 / 5 players = $15/player\n\nSo, if everyone invests their maximum, the total payout for each player would be $15."
