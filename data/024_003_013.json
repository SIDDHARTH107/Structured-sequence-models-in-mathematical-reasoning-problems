    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + 2y^2 at the point (-1, 1, 3), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by setting x = u and y = v. Then, the surface can be represented as a vector function:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + 2v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the first fundamental form by computing the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 4v)\n\nThe coefficients of the first fundamental form are:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 8uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 16v^2\n\nNow, we need to find the second fundamental form. To do this, we first find the normal vector N to the surface:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (-2u, -4v, 1)\n\nNext, we find the partial derivatives of N with respect to u and v:\n\nN_u = (∂N/∂u) = (-2, 0, 0)\nN_v = (∂N/∂v) = (0, -4, 0)\n\nThe coefficients of the second fundamental form are:\n\nL = N_u • r_u = -2\nM = N_u • r_v = 0\nN = N_v • r_v = -16\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (-1, 1, 3), we have u = -1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms, we get:\n\nE = 1 + 4(-1)^2 = 5\nF = 8(-1)(1) = -8\nG = 1 + 16(1)^2 = 17\nL = -2\nM = 0\nN = -16\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (-2 * -16 - 0^2) / (5 * 17 - (-8)^2) = (32) / (85 - 64) = 32 / 21\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + 2y^2 at the point (-1, 1, 3) is K = 32/21."
