    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is a multiple of p. In other words, (p-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod p). We are looking for the smallest positive integer n > 2 such that (n-1)! + 1 is not a multiple of n, which means n is not prime.\n\nWe can start by testing the smallest composite number greater than 2, which is 4.\n\nFor n = 4, (4-1)! + 1 = 3! + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7. Since 7 is not a multiple of 4, the smallest positive integer n greater than 2 such that (n-1)! + 1 is not a multiple of n is 4."
