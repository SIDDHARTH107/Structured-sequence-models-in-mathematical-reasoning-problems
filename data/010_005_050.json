    "message_2": "Assume for contradiction that there exists a path $p: [0, 1] \\rightarrow X$ connecting $x$ and $y$. That is, $p(0) = x$ and $p(1) = y$. Since $p$ is continuous, the preimages of open sets under $p$ are open in $[0, 1]$. \n\nNow, consider the open sets $p^{-1}(U)$ and $p^{-1}(V)$. Since $U$ and $V$ are open in $X$, $p^{-1}(U)$ and $p^{-1}(V)$ are open in $[0, 1]$. Moreover, $p^{-1}(U) \\cup p^{-1}(V) = p^{-1}(U \\cup V) = p^{-1}(X) = [0, 1]$. \n\nSince $p(0) = x \\in U$, we have $0 \\in p^{-1}(U)$. Similarly, since $p(1) = y \\in V$, we have $1 \\in p^{-1}(V)$. \n\nNow, we claim that $p^{-1}(U)$ and $p^{-1}(V)$ are disjoint. Suppose there exists $t \\in p^{-1}(U) \\cap p^{-1}(V)$. Then, $p(t) \\in U \\cap V$, which contradicts the fact that $U$ and $V$ are disjoint. Therefore, $p^{-1}(U)$ and $p^{-1}(V)$ are disjoint.\n\nWe have now shown that $[0, 1] = p^{-1}(U) \\cup p^{-1}(V)$, where $p^{-1}(U)$ and $p^{-1}(V)$ are disjoint, non-empty open sets in $[0, 1]$. However, this contradicts the fact that $[0, 1]$ is connected, as connected spaces cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint, non-empty open sets.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists a path connecting $x$ and $y$ must be false. Hence, there exists no path in $X$ connecting $x$ and $y$."
