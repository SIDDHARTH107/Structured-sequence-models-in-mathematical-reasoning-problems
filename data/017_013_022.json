    "message_2": "The number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18 is 5.\n\nTo determine this, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. Thus, we have the following possibilities for the orders of the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. A 2-Sylow subgroup of order 2 and a 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9.\n2. A 2-Sylow subgroup of order 2 and a 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3.\n\nFor the first case, there are two possibilities for the 3-Sylow subgroup: it can be either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_9) or non-cyclic (isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3). In both cases, the semi-direct product with the 2-Sylow subgroup (isomorphic to Z_2) gives two non-isomorphic groups.\n\nFor the second case, there is only one possibility for the 3-Sylow subgroup: it must be isomorphic to Z_3. The semi-direct product with the 2-Sylow subgroup (isomorphic to Z_2) gives one non-isomorphic group.\n\nIn total, we have 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 18."
