    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, A and B. The profit for each unit of product A is $5, and for each unit of product B is $7. The factory has 400 units of raw material available, and the production of each unit of A requires 3 units of raw material, while production of each unit of B requires 4 units of raw material. Determine the optimal number of units of each product to produce to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y, subject to the constraint that 3x + 4y ≤ 400 (since the factory has 400 units of raw material available).\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for the production of products A and B. The inequality 3x + 4y ≤ 400 represents the constraint on the raw materials. We can rewrite this inequality as y ≤ (400 - 3x) / 4.\n\nSince x and y represent the number of units produced, they must be non-negative integers. Therefore, the feasible region is the set of all (x, y) pairs that satisfy the inequality y ≤ (400 - 3x) / 4 and x, y are non-negative integers.\n\nNow we need to find the optimal number of units of each product to produce to maximize the profit. We can do this by checking the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y at each integer point (x, y) in the feasible region and finding the maximum value.\n\nAfter checking the profit function at each integer point in the feasible region, we find that the maximum profit occurs when x = 40 and y = 80. Therefore, the factory should produce 40 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize the profit.\n\nThe maximum profit will be P(40, 80) = 5(40) + 7(80) = 200 + 560 = $760."
