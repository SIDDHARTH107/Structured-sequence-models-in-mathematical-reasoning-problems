    "message_1": "A statue is located 20 meters away from a building. The angle of elevation of the statue from the ground is 30 degrees while the angle of elevation of the top of the building from the same point on the ground is 60 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have two right triangles here: one formed by the statue and the ground, and the other formed by the building and the ground.\n\nFor the statue:\nThe angle of elevation is 30 degrees, and the distance from the statue to the building is 20 meters. We can use the tangent function to find the height of the statue (h1):\n\ntan(30) = h1 / 20\nh1 = 20 * tan(30)\nh1 ≈ 20 * 0.577 (since tan(30) ≈ 0.577)\nh1 ≈ 11.54 meters\n\nFor the building:\nThe angle of elevation is 60 degrees, and the distance from the building to the point on the ground is still 20 meters. We can use the tangent function to find the height of the building (h2):\n\ntan(60) = h2 / 20\nh2 = 20 * tan(60)\nh2 ≈ 20 * 1.732 (since tan(60) ≈ 1.732)\nh2 ≈ 34.64 meters\n\nNow we have the height of the statue (h1) and the height of the building (h2). To find the total height of the building, we can simply add the height of the statue to the height of the building:\n\nTotal height = h1 + h2\nTotal height ≈ 11.54 + 34.64\nTotal height ≈ 46.18 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 46.18 meters."
