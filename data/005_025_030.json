    "message_1": "In a statistics class, the professor randomly selects 20 students and asks them about their heights. The mean height of the selected students is 165 cm and the standard deviation is 5 cm. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height of all students in the class.",
    "message_2": "To construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nThe critical value for a 95% confidence interval with a sample size of 20 is found using the t-distribution table, since the population standard deviation is unknown. The degrees of freedom (df) for this problem is 20 - 1 = 19. Looking up the critical value for a 95% confidence interval with 19 degrees of freedom, we find that it is approximately 2.093.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the standard error. The standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Sample Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nStandard Error = 5 / √(20) ≈ 1.118\n\nNow we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 165 ± (2.093 * 1.118)\n\nConfidence Interval = 165 ± 2.342\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height of all students in the class is approximately (162.658 cm, 167.342 cm)."
