    "message_2": "Since the plane is traveling at a speed of 400 km/hour with a heading of 30 degrees north of east, we can break down its velocity into its eastward and northward components using trigonometry.\n\nLet V_east be the eastward component of the velocity and V_north be the northward component of the velocity.\n\nV_east = 400 * cos(30°)\nV_north = 400 * sin(30°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nV_east ≈ 400 * 0.866 = 346.41 km/hour\nV_north ≈ 400 * 0.5 = 200 km/hour\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the plane's velocity relative to the ground using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV_total = sqrt(V_east^2 + V_north^2)\nV_total = sqrt((346.41)^2 + (200)^2)\nV_total ≈ sqrt(120000 + 120000)\nV_total ≈ 400 km/hour\n\nThe magnitude of the plane's velocity relative to the ground is 400 km/hour.\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = V_north / V_east\nθ = arctan(V_north / V_east)\nθ = arctan(200 / 346.41)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 30°\n\nThe direction of the plane's velocity relative to the ground is 30 degrees north of east."
