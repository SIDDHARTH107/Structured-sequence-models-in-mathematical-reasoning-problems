    "message_2": "First, we need to write the given system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 7 \\\\\n4 & 7 & 10\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nx = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n20 \\\\\n29 \\\\\n38\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. We want to find a lower triangular matrix L such that A = LL^T.\n\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\nl_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\\nl_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\\\\nl_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition formulas:\n\nl_{11} = \\sqrt{a_{11}} = \\sqrt{2}\nl_{21} = a_{21}/l_{11} = 3/\\sqrt{2}\nl_{31} = a_{31}/l_{11} = 4/\\sqrt{2}\nl_{22} = \\sqrt{a_{22} - l_{21}^2} = \\sqrt{5 - (3/\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{1}\nl_{32} = (a_{32} - l_{21}l_{31})/l_{22} = (7 - (3/\\sqrt{2})(4/\\sqrt{2}))/1 = 1\nl_{33} = \\sqrt{a_{33} - l_{31}^2 - l_{32}^2} = \\sqrt{10 - (4/\\sqrt{2})^2 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\nSo, L = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3/\\sqrt{2} & 1 & 0 \\\\\n4/\\sqrt{2} & 1 & \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3/\\sqrt{2} & 1 & 0 \\\\\n4/\\sqrt{2} & 1 & \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n20 \\\\\n29 \\\\\n38\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny_1 = 20/\\sqrt{2} = 10\\sqrt{2}\ny_2 = (29 - 3/\\sqrt{2} * 10\\sqrt{2}) = -1\ny_3 = (38 - 4/\\sqrt{2} * 10\\sqrt{2} - 1) / \\sqrt{2} = 1\\sqrt{2}\n\nNow, we will solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{2} & 3/\\sqrt{2} & 4/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n10\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n-1 \\\\\n1\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nz = (1\\sqrt{2})/\\sqrt{2} = 1\ny = -1 - z = -2\nx = (10\\sqrt{2} - 3/\\sqrt{2} * (-2) - 4/\\sqrt{2})/\\sqrt{2} = 4\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 4\ny = -2\nz = 1"
