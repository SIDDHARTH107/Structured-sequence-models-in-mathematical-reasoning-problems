    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. Consider one person in the group. This person can have at most 5 friends or 5 non-friends (strangers) among the other 5 people. If this person has 3 or more friends, then either these 3 friends are mutual friends with each other, or there exists a pair of mutual strangers among them. Similarly, if this person has 3 or more strangers, then either these 3 strangers are mutual strangers with each other, or there exists a pair of mutual friends among them.\n\nSo, to guarantee that there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers in the group, we need to make sure that each person has at least 3 friends or 3 strangers. In the worst-case scenario, we can have a person with 2 friends and 3 strangers. However, this doesn't guarantee the existence of 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where each person has at least 3 friends. In this case, we can arrange the friendships in the following way:\n\n1. Person A is friends with B, C, and D.\n2. Person B is friends with A, C, and E.\n3. Person C is friends with A, B, and F.\n4. Person D is friends with A, E, and F.\n5. Person E is friends with B, D, and F.\n6. Person F is friends with C, D, and E.\n\nIn this arrangement, there are a total of 9 friendships. This guarantees that there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers in the group. For example, consider persons A, B, and C. They are all mutual friends. Therefore, the minimum number of friendships that must exist among these 6 friends to guarantee that there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers in the group is 9."
