    "message_2": "To determine the Betti numbers of the Morse-Smale complex, we need to compute the ranks of the homology groups. We can do this using the Morse inequalities, which relate the Betti numbers to the number of critical points of each index.\n\nThe Morse inequalities state that:\n\n$b_k \\leq n_k$\n\nwhere $b_k$ is the k-th Betti number and $n_k$ is the number of critical points of index k.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n- 4 critical points of index 0 (minima)\n- 3 critical points of index 1 (saddles)\n\nSince there are no critical points of index 2 or higher, we know that $b_2 = b_3 = \\cdots = 0$.\n\nNow, let's compute the Betti numbers for k = 0 and k = 1.\n\nFor k = 0, we have:\n\n$b_0 \\leq n_0 = 4$\n\nSince the complex is connected, we know that $b_0 = 1$.\n\nFor k = 1, we have:\n\n$b_1 \\leq n_1 = 3$\n\nTo determine the exact value of $b_1$, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic of the complex is given by:\n\n$\\chi = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k b_k$\n\nSince there are no critical points of index 2 or higher, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\n$\\chi = b_0 - b_1$\n\nWe can compute the Euler characteristic using the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index:\n\n$\\chi = n_0 - n_1 = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $b_1$:\n\n$1 = 1 - b_1 \\Rightarrow b_1 = 0$\n\nSo, the Betti numbers of the Morse-Smale complex are:\n\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 0$\n$b_2 = b_3 = \\cdots = 0$"
