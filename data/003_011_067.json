    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet above ground level. From the plane, an observer sees a building on the ground and the angle of depression to the base of the building is 30°. Find the distance between the plane and the building, assuming the observer is directly above the plane. Round your answer to the nearest foot.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the plane and the building, we can use the tangent function in a right triangle. The angle of depression is 30°, which means the angle between the ground and the observer's line of sight is also 30°. Let's call the distance between the plane and the building \"d\" and the horizontal distance between the plane and the point on the ground directly below it \"x\".\n\nIn the right triangle formed by the altitude of the plane, the horizontal distance x, and the distance d, we have:\n\ntan(30°) = (10,000 feet) / x\n\nx = (10,000 feet) / tan(30°)\n\nx ≈ 17,320 feet\n\nNow we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance d:\n\nd^2 = x^2 + (10,000 feet)^2\n\nd^2 = (17,320 feet)^2 + (10,000 feet)^2\n\nd^2 ≈ 299,424,000 + 100,000,000\n\nd^2 ≈ 399,424,000\n\nd ≈ √399,424,000\n\nd ≈ 19,985 feet\n\nThe distance between the plane and the building is approximately 19,985 feet, rounded to the nearest foot."
