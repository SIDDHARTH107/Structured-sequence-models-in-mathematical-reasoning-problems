    "message_2": "To calculate the hyperbolic distance between two points in the Poincaré disk model, we can use the following formula:\n\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 2 * (||u - v||^2) / ((1 - ||u||^2) * (1 - ||v||^2)))\n\nwhere d(u, v) is the hyperbolic distance between points u and v, ||u|| and ||v|| are the Euclidean norms of u and v, and ||u - v|| is the Euclidean distance between u and v.\n\nFirst, let's find the Euclidean norms of the given points:\n\nu = (2, 4)\nv = (-3, 6)\n\n||u|| = sqrt(2^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(20)\n||v|| = sqrt((-3)^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(45)\n\nNext, let's find the Euclidean distance between the points:\n\n||u - v|| = sqrt((2 - (-3))^2 + (4 - 6)^2) = sqrt(5^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(29)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for the hyperbolic distance:\n\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 2 * (29) / ((1 - 20) * (1 - 45)))\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 58 / (-19 * -44))\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1 + 58 / 836)\nd(u, v) = arcosh(1.069377990430622)\n\nFinally, we find the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the result:\n\nd(u, v) ≈ 0.556\n\nSo, the hyperbolic distance between the points (2, 4) and (-3, 6) in the Poincaré disk model is approximately 0.556."
