    "message_2": "Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a continuous and surjective map $f: S^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Since $S^2$ is compact and connected, its image under a continuous map, $f(S^2)$, is also compact and connected in $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $f(S^2)$ must be a closed interval $[a, b]$ with $a < b$.\n\nNow, let $p \\in S^2$ be any point, and let $A = S^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$. Since $S^2$ is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, removing a point from $S^2$ results in a space homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, $A$ is connected.\n\nConsider the restriction of $f$ to $A$, i.e., $f|_A: A \\rightarrow [a, b]$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exists a point $q \\in A$ such that $f(q) = a$, and another point $r \\in A$ such that $f(r) = b$. Since $A$ is connected, the image of $A$ under $f|_A$, i.e., $f|_A(A)$, must also be connected. Therefore, $f|_A(A) = [a, b]$.\n\nNow, consider the function $g: S^2 \\rightarrow [a, b]$ defined by $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in S^2$. Since $f$ is continuous, $g$ is also continuous. Moreover, $g$ is surjective, as $g(S^2) = f(S^2) = [a, b]$.\n\nNow, let's remove the points $q$ and $r$ from $S^2$. The resulting space, $S^2 \\setminus \\{q, r\\}$, is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of two open intervals, say $(a', b')$ and $(c', d')$. Let $B = S^2 \\setminus \\{q, r\\}$. Then, the restriction of $g$ to $B$, i.e., $g|_B: B \\rightarrow [a, b]$, is continuous.\n\nHowever, since $B$ is a disjoint union of two open intervals, its image under $g|_B$ must also be a disjoint union of two open intervals. But this contradicts the fact that $g|_B(B) = [a, b]$, as $[a, b]$ is a connected set.\n\nThis contradiction implies that our initial assumption was false, and there does not exist a continuous and surjective map $f: S^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$."
