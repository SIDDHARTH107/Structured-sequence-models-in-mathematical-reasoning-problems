    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is that there is one 2-Sylow subgroup, P, of order 4. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are that there is one 3-Sylow subgroup, Q, of order 3, or four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 3.\n\nCase 1: There is one 3-Sylow subgroup, Q, of order 3.\nSince P and Q are both normal in G, we can consider their product, PQ. Since P and Q have trivial intersection (only the identity element), we have |PQ| = |P||Q| = 12, so PQ = G. Since P and Q are both abelian (as they have prime order), G is also abelian. The only abelian group of order 12 is the cyclic group C12, so G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: There are four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 3.\nLet H be the set of all elements of order 3 in G. Since there are four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 3, and each has two non-identity elements, |H| = 8. Let x be an element of order 2 in G. Then, for any y in H, we have (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = e, so xy has order 2. Thus, every element of G is either in H or has order 2. Since there are 12 elements in G and 8 elements in H, there are 4 elements of order 2 in G.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of 3-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. This action gives a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S4. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all 3-Sylow subgroups, which is trivial (only the identity element). Thus, the homomorphism is injective, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S4.\n\nSince G has 12 elements and S4 has 24 elements, G must have index 2 in S4. The only subgroup of index 2 in S4 is the alternating group A4, so G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nCase 3: G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\nIf G is not isomorphic to either C12 or A4, then it must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D6, which is the only other group of order 12.\n\nNow, let's find the isomorphism for G if G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nA4 is the group of even permutations on 4 elements. We can represent A4 as the set of 3-cycles and the identity permutation in S4:\n\nA4 = {(1), (123), (132), (124), (142), (134), (143), (234), (243), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}\n\nIf G is isomorphic to A4, we can define an isomorphism φ: G → A4. Let g1, g2, g3 be the generators of the 3-Sylow subgroups in G, and let x be an element of order 2 in G. Then, we can define φ as follows:\n\nφ(e) = (1)\nφ(g1) = (123)\nφ(g1^2) = (132)\nφ(g2) = (124)\nφ(g2^2) = (142)\nφ(g3) = (134)\nφ(g3^2) = (143)\nφ(x) = (12)(34)\nφ(xg1) = (13)(24)\nφ(xg2) = (14)(23)\n\nThis mapping is a bijection and preserves the group operation, so it is an isomorphism between G and A4."
