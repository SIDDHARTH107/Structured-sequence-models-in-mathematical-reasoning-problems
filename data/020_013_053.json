Here's a question for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose we want to maximize the function \nf(x) = 2x_1 + 4x_2\n\nsubject to the following constraints:\n\nx_1 + x_2 <= 2\nx_1 - x_2 >= 1\nx_1, x_2 >= 0\n\nExpress this problem in semidefinite programming form and find its optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To express this problem in semidefinite programming form, we first need to rewrite the objective function and constraints in the appropriate form. The given problem is a linear programming problem, not a semidefinite programming problem. However, we can still solve it using linear programming techniques.\n\nObjective function: f(x) = 2x_1 + 4x_2\n\nConstraints:\n1. x_1 + x_2 <= 2\n2. x_1 - x_2 >= 1\n3. x_1, x_2 >= 0\n\nNow, we can use the graphical method to find the optimal solution. First, we'll plot the constraint inequalities on the coordinate plane:\n\n1. x_1 + x_2 <= 2\n2. x_1 - x_2 >= 1\n3. x_1, x_2 >= 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a triangle with vertices at (1, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. f(1, 0) = 2(1) + 4(0) = 2\n2. f(1, 1) = 2(1) + 4(1) = 6\n3. f(2, 0) = 2(2) + 4(0) = 4\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 6, which occurs at the vertex (1, 1). Therefore, the optimal solution is x_1 = 1 and x_2 = 1."
