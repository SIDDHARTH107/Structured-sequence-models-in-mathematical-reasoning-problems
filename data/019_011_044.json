If exactly 4 clues are relevant to the case and there are no irrelevant clues present, how many ways can the relevant clues be selected?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of selecting k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n, and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, there are 6 clues (n = 6) and we want to select 4 relevant clues (k = 4). So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4!(6-4)!)\n\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4!2!)\n\nC(6, 4) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(6, 4) = (720) / (24 × 2)\n\nC(6, 4) = 720 / 48\n\nC(6, 4) = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 different ways to select the 4 relevant clues from the 6 clues in the crime scene investigation."
