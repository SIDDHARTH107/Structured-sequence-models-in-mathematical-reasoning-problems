    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob using RSA encryption. Alice chooses p = 11 and q = 13 as her prime numbers to create a public key (i.e., n) and a private key (i.e., d). Determine Alice's public key and private key, and use them to encrypt the message \"HELLO\". Show all your work.",
    "message_2": "To determine Alice's public key and private key, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate n = p * q\n2. Calculate the totient function, φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\n3. Choose a public exponent, e, such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1\n4. Calculate the private exponent, d, such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n\nStep 1: Calculate n\nn = p * q = 11 * 13 = 143\n\nStep 2: Calculate φ(n)\nφ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (11 - 1) * (13 - 1) = 10 * 12 = 120\n\nStep 3: Choose a public exponent, e\nWe can choose e = 3, as it is a common choice for RSA encryption and gcd(3, 120) = 1.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the private exponent, d\nWe need to find a value for d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)). In other words, we need to find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)).\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 27, as 27 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 120).\n\nNow, Alice's public key is (n, e) = (143, 3), and her private key is (n, d) = (143, 27).\n\nTo encrypt the message \"HELLO\", we need to convert each letter to its ASCII value, then encrypt each value using the public key.\n\nH -> 72\nE -> 69\nL -> 76\nL -> 76\nO -> 79\n\nEncryption formula: c = m^e (mod n)\n\n72^3 (mod 143) = 37\n69^3 (mod 143) = 85\n76^3 (mod 143) = 6\n76^3 (mod 143) = 6\n79^3 (mod 143) = 53\n\nThe encrypted message is: 37 85 6 6 53\n\nTo decrypt the message, we would use the private key and the decryption formula: m = c^d (mod n). However, since the task only asks for encryption, we will stop here."
