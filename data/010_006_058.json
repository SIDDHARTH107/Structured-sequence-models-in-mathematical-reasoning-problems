It can be represented as the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups, which is denoted as:\n\nπ1(T) = Z × Z\n\nHere, Z represents the set of integers, and the direct product Z × Z indicates that the fundamental group of the torus is generated by two independent loops (one going around the \"hole\" of the torus and the other going around the \"body\" of the torus)."
