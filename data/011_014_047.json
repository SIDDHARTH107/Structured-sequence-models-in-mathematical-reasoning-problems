    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using combinatorics. Let's denote the three colors as A, B, and C. We can start by choosing the color for the first vertex, which has 3 options.\n\n1. If the first vertex is colored A, then the second vertex can be colored B or C (2 options). If the second vertex is colored B, then the third vertex can be colored A or C (2 options). If the second vertex is colored C, then the third vertex can also be colored A or B (2 options). So, there are 2 + 2 = 4 ways to color the first three vertices if the first vertex is colored A.\n\n2. Similarly, if the first vertex is colored B, there are 4 ways to color the first three vertices.\n\n3. If the first vertex is colored C, there are 4 ways to color the first three vertices.\n\nNow, let's consider the last three vertices. Since the cycle has length 6, the last vertex must have a different color than the first vertex. We can analyze the cases based on the color of the first vertex:\n\n1. If the first vertex is colored A, then the last vertex can be colored B or C (2 options). If the last vertex is colored B, then the fifth vertex can be colored A or C (2 options). If the last vertex is colored C, then the fifth vertex can be colored A or B (2 options). So, there are 2 + 2 = 4 ways to color the last three vertices if the first vertex is colored A.\n\n2. Similarly, if the first vertex is colored B, there are 4 ways to color the last three vertices.\n\n3. If the first vertex is colored C, there are 4 ways to color the last three vertices.\n\nNow, we can multiply the number of ways to color the first three vertices by the number of ways to color the last three vertices for each case:\n\n1. If the first vertex is colored A, there are 4 * 4 = 16 ways to color the entire cycle.\n2. If the first vertex is colored B, there are 4 * 4 = 16 ways to color the entire cycle.\n3. If the first vertex is colored C, there are 4 * 4 = 16 ways to color the entire cycle.\n\nSo, there are a total of 16 + 16 + 16 = 48 ways to color the cycle of length 6 using 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color."
