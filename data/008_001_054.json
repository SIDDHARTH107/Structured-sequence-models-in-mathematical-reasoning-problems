    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we'll first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    |  2 |\n\nNow, we'll find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)) and then multiply it with matrix B to get the matrix X.\n\nTo find the inverse of A, we'll first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (2 * -2) - (3 * 4)\ndet(A) = -4 - 12\ndet(A) = -16\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A (adj(A)) is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the signs of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nadj(A) = | -2 -3 |\n         | -4  2 |\n\nNow, let's find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-16) * | -2 -3 |\n                  | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 1/8  3/16 |\n         | 1/4 -1/8  |\n\nNow, we'll multiply A^(-1) with B to get X.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | 1/8  3/16 | * | 11 |\n    | 1/4 -1/8  |   |  2 |\n\nTo perform the matrix multiplication:\n\nx = (1/8 * 11) + (3/16 * 2)\nx = 11/8 + 3/8\nx = 14/8\nx = 7/4\n\ny = (1/4 * 11) - (1/8 * 2)\ny = 11/4 - 1/4\ny = 10/4\ny = 5/2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 7/4 and y = 5/2."
