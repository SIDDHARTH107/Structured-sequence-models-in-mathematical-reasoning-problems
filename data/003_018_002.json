    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function y = 4sin(3x) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's break down the function into its outer and inner functions:\n\nOuter function: y = 4sin(u)\nInner function: u = 3x\n\nNow, we will find the derivatives of the outer and inner functions:\n\nDerivative of the outer function with respect to u: dy/du = 4cos(u)\nDerivative of the inner function with respect to x: du/dx = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = dy/du * du/dx\n\nSubstitute the derivatives we found earlier:\n\ndy/dx = (4cos(u)) * (3)\n\nNow, substitute the inner function (u = 3x) back into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = 4cos(3x) * 3\n\nSimplify:\n\ndy/dx = 12cos(3x)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function y = 4sin(3x) with respect to x is dy/dx = 12cos(3x)."
