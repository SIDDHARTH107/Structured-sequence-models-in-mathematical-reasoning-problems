    "message_2": "To find the size of the maximum independent set in G, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of the maximum independent set (α(G)) and the minimum vertex cover (β(G)) is equal to the number of vertices in the graph (n).\n\nn = α(G) + β(G)\n\nWe know that n = 9, so we need to find the minimum vertex cover (β(G)).\n\nSince G has 12 edges, we can use the inequality that states that the number of edges in a graph is less than or equal to the product of the size of the maximum independent set and the size of the minimum vertex cover:\n\n|E| ≤ α(G) * β(G)\n\n12 ≤ α(G) * β(G)\n\nNow, let's find an upper bound for β(G). In the worst-case scenario, G is a complete bipartite graph, which means that it can be divided into two disjoint sets of vertices such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. For a complete bipartite graph with 9 vertices, the maximum number of edges is achieved when the graph is K(4,5), which has 4 * 5 = 20 edges. However, G has only 12 edges, so β(G) must be less than 5.\n\nSince β(G) is an integer, we can try values for β(G) starting from the largest possible value (4) and work our way down. If we find a value that satisfies the inequality, we can use it to find the size of the maximum independent set.\n\nTrying β(G) = 4:\n\n12 ≤ α(G) * 4\n\n3 ≤ α(G)\n\nSince α(G) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for α(G) is 3. This satisfies the inequality, so we can use β(G) = 4.\n\nNow we can find the size of the maximum independent set:\n\n9 = α(G) + 4\n\nα(G) = 5\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in G is 5."
