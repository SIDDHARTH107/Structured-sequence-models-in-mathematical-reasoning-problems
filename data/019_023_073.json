    "message_2": "Since the quality control team found that 25% of the pens were defective, we can assume that 25% of the total pens produced in a day are also defective.\n\nTotal pens produced in a day = 5000\nDefective pens in a day = 25% of 5000\nDefective pens in a day = 0.25 * 5000\nDefective pens in a day = 1250\n\nNow, we need to find the number of defective pens produced in a month of 30 days.\n\nDefective pens in a month = Defective pens in a day * Number of days in a month\nDefective pens in a month = 1250 * 30\nDefective pens in a month = 37500\n\nSo, the factory can expect to produce 37,500 defective pens in a month of 30 days."
