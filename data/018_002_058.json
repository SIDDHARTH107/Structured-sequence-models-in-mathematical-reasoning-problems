By definition of intersection, this means that x is an element in both A and B (x ∈ A and x ∈ B).\n\nNow, since x is an element in A, it follows that x is in A. Similarly, since x is an element in B, it follows that x is in B.\n\nThus, we have shown that for any arbitrary element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element in A and in B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively. QED."
