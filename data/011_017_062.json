    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square with the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's start by filling in the first row and first column:\n\n1 _ _\n_ 2 _\n_ _ 3\n\nThere are two possible ways to fill in the second row:\n\n1 _ _\n_ 2 _\n_ _ 3\n\nOption 1:\n1 2 3\n_ 2 _\n_ _ 3\n\nOption 2:\n1 3 2\n_ 2 _\n_ _ 3\n\nNow let's fill in the remaining cells:\n\nOption 1:\n1 2 3\n3 2 1\n_ _ 3\n\nThere is no valid way to fill in the last row without repeating a number in a column.\n\nOption 2:\n1 3 2\n2 1 3\n_ _ 3\n\nThe last row can be filled in as follows:\n\n1 3 2\n2 1 3\n3 2 1\n\nSo, there is only 1 possible 3x3 Latin square using the numbers 1, 2, and 3 such that each row and each column contains exactly one occurrence of each of the three numbers:\n\n1 3 2\n2 1 3\n3 2 1"
