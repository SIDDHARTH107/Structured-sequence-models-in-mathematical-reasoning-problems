    "message_1": "A radio tower is located on top of a hill that is 200 meters high. The angle of depression from the top of the tower to a point on the ground is 40 degrees. What is the distance from the base of the hill to the point on the ground where the tower is located? (Hint: You can use the tangent function to solve this problem.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function and set up a right triangle with the angle of depression, the height of the hill, and the distance from the base of the hill to the point on the ground.\n\nLet's call the angle of depression A, which is 40 degrees. The height of the hill (opposite side) is 200 meters, and we want to find the distance from the base of the hill to the point on the ground (adjacent side), which we'll call x.\n\nWe can use the tangent function as follows:\n\ntan(A) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(40) = 200 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 200 / tan(40)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 200 / 0.8391\nx ≈ 238.37 meters\n\nSo, the distance from the base of the hill to the point on the ground where the tower is located is approximately 238.37 meters."
