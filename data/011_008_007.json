    "message_2": "To partition a set of 7 elements into 4 non-empty subsets, we use Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), where n is the number of elements in the set and k is the number of non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and k = 4. We can find the Stirling number S(7, 4) using the following recurrence relation:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(7, 4), we need to calculate the values of S(6, 4) and S(6, 3). We can do this using the same recurrence relation:\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3)\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of S(5, 4), S(5, 3), and S(5, 2). We continue using the recurrence relation:\n\nS(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3)\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\n\nWe can now find the values of S(4, 4), S(4, 3), S(4, 2), and S(4, 1) using the base cases of Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, 1) = 1 for all n\nS(n, n) = 1 for all n\nS(n, 0) = 0 for all n > 0\n\nSo, we have:\n\nS(4, 4) = 1\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\nS(4, 1) = 1\n\nNow we can find the values of S(5, 4), S(5, 3), and S(5, 2):\n\nS(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3) = 4 * 1 + 6 = 10\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\nNow we can find the values of S(6, 4) and S(6, 3):\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3) = 4 * 10 + 25 = 65\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\n\nFinally, we can find the value of S(7, 4):\n\nS(7, 4) = 4 * S(6, 4) + S(6, 3) = 4 * 65 + 90 = 350\n\nSo, there are 350 ways to partition a set of 7 elements into 4 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
