    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 48: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1\n2. Calculate the number of abelian groups using the formula: p(n) = p(a) * p(b) * ... * p(k), where p(a) is the number of partitions of a, and a, b, ... , k are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of the group order. In this case, p(4) = 5 and p(1) = 1, so p(48) = 5 * 1 = 5. There are 5 abelian groups of order 48.\n3. To find the total number of groups, we can use the formula: g(n) = sum of g(d) for all divisors d of n, where g(d) is the number of groups of order d. In this case, the divisors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48. We know g(1) = 1, g(2) = 1, g(3) = 1, g(4) = 2, g(6) = 2, g(8) = 5, g(12) = 5, g(16) = 14, g(24) = 15, and g(48) = x, where x is the number of groups of order 48 that we want to find.\n4. Using the formula, we get: x = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 14 + 15 = 46. Therefore, there are 46 groups of order 48.\n5. Since we already found 5 abelian groups, we subtract them from the total number of groups to get the number of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups: 46 - 5 = 41.\n\nSo, there are 41 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 48."
