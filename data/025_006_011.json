    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global holomorphic sections of the sheaf of holomorphic 2-forms on X, we will use the adjunction formula and some facts about the canonical bundle of projective space.\n\nFirst, let's compute the degree of X. The degree of a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ is given by the degree of its defining polynomial. In this case, the degree of F is 3. So, X is a cubic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nNow, let's compute the canonical bundle of X. The canonical bundle of $\\mathbb{P}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ is $\\mathcal{O}(-4)$. By the adjunction formula, the canonical bundle of X is given by:\n\n$\\mathcal{K}_X = \\mathcal{K}_{\\mathbb{P}^3(\\mathbb{C})} \\otimes \\mathcal{O}(3) = \\mathcal{O}(-4) \\otimes \\mathcal{O}(3) = \\mathcal{O}(-1)$.\n\nNow, we want to compute the dimension of the space of global holomorphic sections of the sheaf of holomorphic 2-forms on X, which is given by $H^0(X, \\Omega_X^2)$. By the adjunction formula, we have:\n\n$\\Omega_X^2 = \\mathcal{K}_X = \\mathcal{O}(-1)$.\n\nTo compute the dimension of the space of global holomorphic sections of $\\mathcal{O}(-1)$ on X, we can use the fact that the cohomology of $\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C})$ is given by:\n\n$H^i(\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C}), \\mathcal{O}(k)) = \\begin{cases} \\binom{n+k}{n} & \\text{if } i = 0 \\text{ and } k \\geq 0, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases}$\n\nSince X is a cubic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3(\\mathbb{C})$, it is a smooth projective variety of dimension 2. Therefore, we can restrict the above formula to X:\n\n$H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}(-1)) = 0$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of global holomorphic sections of the sheaf of holomorphic 2-forms on X is 0."
