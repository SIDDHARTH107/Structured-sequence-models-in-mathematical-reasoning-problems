    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we first need to understand the structure of the graph. The graph is a simple, connected, planar graph with 4 vertices and 5 edges. It is also known as the diamond graph or the kite graph.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T(G; x, y) of a graph G can be computed recursively using the following rules:\n\n1. If G has no edges, then T(G; x, y) = x^(number of connected components of G).\n2. If e is a loop in G, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by removing the loop e from G.\n3. If e is a bridge in G (i.e., removing e disconnects G), then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y), where G / e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e in G.\n4. If e is neither a loop nor a bridge in G, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y).\n\nIn our case, the graph has no loops, and all edges are bridges. Therefore, we can apply rule 3 to compute the Tutte polynomial.\n\nLet's label the edges as follows:\n\n```\n        1\n       /a\\\n      /   \\\n     2--b--3\n      \\   /\n       \\c/\n        4\n```\n\nWe can remove and contract each edge one by one and apply rule 3:\n\n1. Remove edge a: The graph becomes two isolated edges (2-4 and 3-1). The Tutte polynomial of this graph is x^2.\n2. Contract edge a: The graph becomes a triangle (2-3-4). The Tutte polynomial of this graph is x + y.\n\nSo, T(G; x, y) = x^2 + (x + y) for edge a.\n\nNow, let's consider edge b:\n\n1. Remove edge b: The graph becomes a path (1-2-4-3). The Tutte polynomial of this graph is x.\n2. Contract edge b: The graph becomes a triangle (1-2-4). The Tutte polynomial of this graph is x + y.\n\nSo, T(G; x, y) = x + (x + y) for edge b.\n\nFinally, let's consider edge c:\n\n1. Remove edge c: The graph becomes a path (1-3-2-4). The Tutte polynomial of this graph is x.\n2. Contract edge c: The graph becomes a triangle (1-2-3). The Tutte polynomial of this graph is x + y.\n\nSo, T(G; x, y) = x + (x + y) for edge c.\n\nSince all edges are bridges, we can sum the Tutte polynomials for each edge:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x^2 + x + y) + (x + x + y) + (x + x + y) = x^2 + 4x + 3y.\n\nThus, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is T(G; x, y) = x^2 + 4x + 3y."
