    "message_2": "To apply the 2D Fourier transform on the adjacency matrix I, we will use the following formula:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ Σ I(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (ux/M + vy/N))\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the transformed image, I(x, y) is the original image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (256x256), and u, v, x, and y are the indices of the image. The summations are over x = 0 to M-1 and y = 0 to N-1.\n\nTo calculate the magnitude and phase of the frequency component at position (30, 40) in the transformed image, we need to compute F(30, 40). However, since we don't have the actual values of the adjacency matrix I, we cannot compute the exact value of F(30, 40).\n\nIf we had the value of F(30, 40), we could calculate the magnitude and phase as follows:\n\nMagnitude: |F(30, 40)| = sqrt(Re(F(30, 40))^2 + Im(F(30, 40))^2)\nPhase: Φ(30, 40) = atan2(Im(F(30, 40)), Re(F(30, 40)))\n\nwhere Re(F(30, 40)) and Im(F(30, 40)) are the real and imaginary parts of F(30, 40), respectively, and atan2 is the arctangent function with two arguments.\n\nIn summary, without the actual values of the adjacency matrix I, we cannot compute the magnitude and phase of the frequency component at position (30, 40) in the transformed image."
