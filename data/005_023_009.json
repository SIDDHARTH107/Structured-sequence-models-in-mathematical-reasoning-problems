    "message_1": "A class of 25 students took a mathematics quiz, and the scores range from 50 to 95. However, the score of one student seems to be an outlier. The mean score is 76 and the standard deviation is 8.5. Determine the score of the potential outlier student.",
    "message_2": "To determine the score of the potential outlier student, we can use the concept of z-scores. A z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A high z-score (usually greater than 2 or less than -2) indicates that the data point is an outlier.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of all the scores in the class, including the outlier:\n\nSum = Mean * Number of students\nSum = 76 * 25\nSum = 1900\n\nNow, let's assume the outlier student has a score of x. We will calculate the sum of the scores without the outlier:\n\nSum_without_outlier = 1900 - x\n\nNext, we will calculate the mean without the outlier:\n\nMean_without_outlier = Sum_without_outlier / (Number of students - 1)\nMean_without_outlier = (1900 - x) / 24\n\nNow, let's calculate the standard deviation without the outlier. We know that the standard deviation with the outlier is 8.5. Since the outlier is likely to increase the standard deviation, we can assume that the standard deviation without the outlier will be slightly smaller. Let's assume it's 8 (this is an assumption, but it will help us to find the potential outlier).\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-score for the potential outlier:\n\nZ-score = (x - Mean_without_outlier) / Standard_deviation_without_outlier\nZ-score = (x - ((1900 - x) / 24)) / 8\n\nSince we are looking for an outlier, we can assume that the z-score is greater than 2 or less than -2. Let's first check for a z-score greater than 2:\n\n2 < (x - ((1900 - x) / 24)) / 8\n\nSolving for x:\n\n16 < x - ((1900 - x) / 24)\n16 < (24x - (1900 - x)) / 24\n384 < 24x - 1900 + x\n2284 < 25x\nx > 91.36\n\nSince the maximum score is 95, the potential outlier could have a score between 91.36 and 95.\n\nNow, let's check for a z-score less than -2:\n\n-2 > (x - ((1900 - x) / 24)) / 8\n\nSolving for x:\n\n-16 > x - ((1900 - x) / 24)\n-384 > 24x - 1900 + x\n-516 < 25x\nx < 20.64\n\nSince the minimum score is 50, there is no potential outlier in this range.\n\nTherefore, the potential outlier student has a score between 91.36 and 95."
