    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. To find the chromatic index of G, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the maximum degree (Δ) of the vertices in the graph.\n2. Check if the graph is a bipartite graph or not.\n3. If the graph is bipartite, the chromatic index is equal to Δ. If not, the chromatic index is either Δ or Δ+1.\n\nStep 1: Determine the maximum degree (Δ) of the vertices in the graph.\nDegree of A: 3 (connected to B, C, and D)\nDegree of B: 3 (connected to A, C, and E)\nDegree of C: 3 (connected to A, B, and D)\nDegree of D: 3 (connected to A, C, and E)\nDegree of E: 2 (connected to B and D)\nThe maximum degree (Δ) is 3.\n\nStep 2: Check if the graph is a bipartite graph or not.\nA bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. In this case, we can divide the vertices into two sets: {A, C, E} and {B, D}. However, since vertices A and C are connected by an edge, the graph is not bipartite.\n\nStep 3: Determine the chromatic index.\nSince the graph is not bipartite, the chromatic index is either Δ or Δ+1. We will try to color the edges using Δ (3) colors and see if it's possible.\n\nWe can color the edges as follows:\nColor 1: AB, CD\nColor 2: AC, BE\nColor 3: AD, DE\n\nSince we were able to color the edges using 3 colors without any adjacent edges sharing the same color, the chromatic index of G is 3."
