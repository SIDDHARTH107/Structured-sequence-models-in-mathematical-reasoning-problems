Determine the Fourier transform of the transmitted signal using the Fourier transform of the network transfer function.",
    "message_2": "To determine the Fourier transform of the transmitted signal, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the digital signal and then multiply it with the transfer function of the network.\n\nThe digital signal is a square wave with an amplitude of 5 volts and a frequency of 1 kHz. The Fourier series representation of a square wave is given by:\n\nx(t) = A * Σ [ (1/n) * sin(2πnft) ] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nwhere A is the amplitude (5 volts), f is the frequency (1 kHz), and n is the odd harmonic number.\n\nThe Fourier transform of x(t) can be found by taking the continuous-time Fourier transform of the square wave:\n\nX(jw) = A * Σ [ (1/n) * (δ(w - 2πn*f) - δ(w + 2πn*f)) ] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nNow, we need to multiply the Fourier transform of the digital signal X(jw) with the transfer function of the network H(jw):\n\nY(jw) = X(jw) * H(jw) = A * Σ [ (1/n) * (δ(w - 2πn*f) - δ(w + 2πn*f)) ] * (2jw)/(jw+2)\n\nSince the transfer function H(jw) is linear, we can multiply it with each term of the Fourier transform of the digital signal:\n\nY(jw) = A * Σ [ (1/n) * ( (2jw)/(jw+2) * δ(w - 2πn*f) - (2jw)/(jw+2) * δ(w + 2πn*f) ) ] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the transmitted signal over the network."
