    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1, which means there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or n_3 = 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\nIf both Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups are normal, then the group is a direct product of these subgroups, which gives a group isomorphic to Z_16 x Z_3 (where Z_n denotes the cyclic group of order n). This is one possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where n_3 = 4. In this case, the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal. However, the Sylow 2-subgroup is still normal, so we can form semidirect products. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16 and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Then, we can form semidirect products of P and Q, denoted as P ⋊ Q.\n\nThere are two non-isomorphic groups of order 16: Z_16 and Z_8 x Z_2. There is only one group of order 3: Z_3. The automorphism group of Z_16, Aut(Z_16), has order 8, and the automorphism group of Z_8 x Z_2, Aut(Z_8 x Z_2), has order 32. \n\nSince |Q| = 3, we need to find homomorphisms from Q to the automorphism groups of P. For Z_16, there are two homomorphisms from Z_3 to Aut(Z_16) (the trivial homomorphism and one of order 3). For Z_8 x Z_2, there are four homomorphisms from Z_3 to Aut(Z_8 x Z_2) (the trivial homomorphism and three of order 3).\n\nIn total, we have 1 (direct product) + 2 (semidirect products with Z_16) + 4 (semidirect products with Z_8 x Z_2) = 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\nThese groups are:\n1. Z_48 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_16 x Z_3 (direct product)\n3. Z_8 x Z_6 (direct product)\n4. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_3 (direct product)\n5. Q_16 x Z_3 (direct product, where Q_16 is the quaternion group of order 16)\n6. Z_4 ⋊ Z_12 (semidirect product)\n7. (Z_8 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_3 (semidirect product)"
