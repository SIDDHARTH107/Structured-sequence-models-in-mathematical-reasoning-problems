    "message_2": "To prove the formula ((A ⊸ B) ⊸ A) ⊸ A is valid in linear logic, we will use the sequent calculus rules for linear logic. We will use the following rules: \n\n1. Axiom rule: A ⊢ A\n2. Cut rule: If Γ ⊢ A and Δ, A ⊢ B, then Γ, Δ ⊢ B\n3. Weakening rule: If Γ ⊢ A, then Γ, B ⊢ A\n4. Contraction rule: If Γ, A, A ⊢ B, then Γ, A ⊢ B\n5. Implication left rule: If Γ, A ⊢ B and Δ, C ⊢ D, then Γ, Δ, A ⊸ B, C ⊢ D\n6. Implication right rule: If Γ, A ⊢ B, then Γ ⊢ A ⊸ B\n\nNow, let's prove the formula step by step:\n\n1. A ⊢ A (by the axiom rule)\n2. (A ⊸ B), A ⊢ A (by the weakening rule on 1)\n3. (A ⊸ B), A ⊢ B (by the cut rule on 1 and 2)\n4. A ⊢ (A ⊸ B) ⊸ A (by the implication right rule on 3)\n5. ((A ⊸ B) ⊸ A) ⊢ A (by the cut rule on 4 and 1)\n\nThus, the formula ((A ⊸ B) ⊸ A) ⊸ A is valid in linear logic."
