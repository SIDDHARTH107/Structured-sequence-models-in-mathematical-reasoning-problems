    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 120 and 96 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (120) by the smaller number (96) and find the remainder.\n   120 รท 96 = 1 with a remainder of 24.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (120) with the smaller number (96), and the smaller number with the remainder (24).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 96 and 24.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (96) by the new smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n   96 รท 24 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 24.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 120 and 96 is 24."
