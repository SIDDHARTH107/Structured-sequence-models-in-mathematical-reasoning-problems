    "message_1": "Suppose that the average weight of a particular brand of cereal is 400 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. Assuming the weight of the cereal follows a normal distribution, what percentage of boxes of this cereal would you expect to weigh more than 415 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of boxes weighing more than 415 grams, we need to calculate the z-score and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we are interested in (415 grams), μ is the mean (400 grams), and σ is the standard deviation (10 grams).\n\nz = (415 - 400) / 10\nz = 15 / 10\nz = 1.5\n\nNow, we look up the z-score of 1.5 in the z-table, which gives us the probability of a box weighing less than 415 grams. The value for a z-score of 1.5 is approximately 0.9332. This means that 93.32% of the boxes weigh less than 415 grams.\n\nSince we want to find the percentage of boxes weighing more than 415 grams, we subtract the probability of boxes weighing less than 415 grams from 1:\n\n1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668\n\nSo, approximately 6.68% of boxes of this cereal would be expected to weigh more than 415 grams."
