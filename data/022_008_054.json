    "message_2": "To determine the order of an entire function, we need to analyze its growth rate as |z| approaches infinity. The order of an entire function is the smallest non-negative number ρ such that the function can be bounded by a polynomial of degree ρ.\n\nLet's analyze the given function f(z) = e^z - z + 2.\n\nAs z approaches infinity, the dominant term in the function is e^z, since it grows much faster than the linear term -z and the constant term 2. The exponential function e^z has an order of 1, as it can be bounded by a polynomial of degree 1 (itself).\n\nTherefore, the order of the entire function f(z) = e^z - z + 2 is 1."
