    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the three equations are multiples of each other. To see this more clearly, we can divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\n1) 3x - 2y + z = 7\n2) 3x - 2y + z = 7 (after dividing the second equation by 2)\n3) 3x - 2y + z = 7 (after dividing the third equation by 3)\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and they all lie on the same line in three-dimensional space. \n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve the first equation for one of the variables, say z:\n\nz = 7 - 3x + 2y\n\nNow, we can express the solution in terms of parameters. Let's introduce a parameter t:\n\nx = t\ny = t\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for x and y into the equation for z:\n\nz = 7 - 3t + 2t\nz = 7 - t\n\nSo the general solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = t\ny = t\nz = 7 - t\n\nwhere t can be any real number."
