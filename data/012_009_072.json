If so, provide one possible graph that matches this degree sequence. If not, explain why it is impossible to draw such a graph.",
    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to draw a graph that matches this degree sequence. Here is one possible graph:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.\n2. Connect vertex A to vertices B, C, and D (A has degree 3).\n3. Connect vertex B to vertices A, C, and E (B has degree 3).\n4. Connect vertex C to vertices A and B (C has degree 2).\n5. Connect vertex D to vertex A (D has degree 2).\n6. Connect vertex E to vertex B (E has degree 1).\n7. Connect vertex F to vertex G (F and G both have degree 1).\n\nThe resulting graph has the desired degree sequence: A(3), B(3), C(2), D(2), E(1), F(1), G(1)."
