    "message_2": "Kuratowski's Theorem states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is homeomorphic to either K₅ (the complete graph on 5 vertices) or K₃,₃ (the complete bipartite graph on two sets of 3 vertices).\n\nTo determine if the graph G is planar or non-planar, we can use the following two observations:\n\n1. A graph with n vertices and m edges is planar if m ≤ 3n - 6.\n2. A bipartite graph with n vertices and m edges is planar if m ≤ 2n - 4.\n\nIn our case, G has 10 vertices (n = 10) and 15 edges (m = 15).\n\nLet's check the first condition:\n\nm ≤ 3n - 6\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that G is planar. However, we need to check if G contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K₅ or K₃,₃.\n\nSince G has 15 edges, it cannot contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K₅, as K₅ has 10 edges. Now, let's check for K₃,₃.\n\nK₃,₃ has 6 vertices and 9 edges. If G contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K₃,₃, then it must be a bipartite graph. Let's check the second condition for bipartite graphs:\n\nm ≤ 2n - 4\n15 ≤ 2 * 10 - 4\n15 ≤ 20 - 4\n15 ≤ 16\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that G contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K₃,₃. However, we cannot conclude that G is non-planar based on this information alone.\n\nIn summary, we cannot definitively determine if G is planar or non-planar using Kuratowski's Theorem with the given information. Further analysis, such as examining the specific structure of G, would be required to make a conclusion."
