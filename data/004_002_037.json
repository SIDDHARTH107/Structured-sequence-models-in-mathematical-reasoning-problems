    "message_2": "To find the limit of the given function as x approaches 3, we first try to simplify the expression. We can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2)\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\n((x - 3)(x + 2))/(x - 3)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 3) terms:\n\n(x + 2)\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 3:\n\nlim (x -> 3) (x + 2) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the limit of the function as x approaches 3 is 5."
