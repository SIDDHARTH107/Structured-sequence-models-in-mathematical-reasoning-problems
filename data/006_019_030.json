    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the distribution of the votes between the candidates. The given information only tells us about the voter turnout, not the distribution of votes between the candidates. If you can provide the distribution of votes between the candidates or any other relevant information, we can help you calculate the probability."
