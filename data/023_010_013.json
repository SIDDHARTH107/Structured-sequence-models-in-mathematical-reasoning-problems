    "message_2": "To compress the image using the Fourier Transform, we first need to find the frequency components of the image. Then, we'll retain only the first 10% of the highest magnitude coefficients and rebuild the image using the inverse Fourier Transform. Finally, we'll calculate the compression ratio achieved.\n\n1. Apply the Fourier Transform to the image to obtain the frequency components.\n2. Retain only the first 10% of the highest magnitude coefficients. Since the image is 512 x 512 pixels, there are a total of 512 x 512 = 262,144 coefficients. We will keep only 10% of these, which is 26,214 coefficients.\n3. Rebuild the image using the inverse Fourier Transform with the retained coefficients.\n\nNow, let's calculate the compression ratio. The original image has 512 x 512 = 262,144 pixels. Since it's a grayscale image, each pixel can be represented by 1 byte (8 bits). So, the original image size is 262,144 bytes.\n\nAfter compression, we have retained only 26,214 coefficients. Assuming each coefficient requires the same storage space as a pixel (1 byte), the compressed image size is 26,214 bytes.\n\nThe compression ratio is calculated as the ratio of the original image size to the compressed image size:\n\nCompression Ratio = (Original Image Size) / (Compressed Image Size)\nCompression Ratio = 262,144 / 26,214\nCompression Ratio â‰ˆ 10\n\nSo, the compression ratio achieved is approximately 10:1."
