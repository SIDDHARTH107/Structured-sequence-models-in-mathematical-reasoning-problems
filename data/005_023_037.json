    "message_1": "Suppose a professor graded a statistics exam with scores ranging from 50 to 95. If the average score was 80 and the standard deviation was 10, what are the outliers in the data set using the 1.5*IQR rule?",
    "message_2": "To find the outliers using the 1.5*IQR rule, we first need to find the quartiles (Q1 and Q3) of the data set. Since we don't have the actual data, we can use the given information (average and standard deviation) to approximate the quartiles using the empirical rule.\n\nThe empirical rule states that for a normal distribution:\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.\n- Approximately 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean.\n- Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean.\n\nSince Q1 represents the 25th percentile and Q3 represents the 75th percentile, we can approximate them as follows:\n- Q1 ≈ mean - 0.675 * standard deviation\n- Q3 ≈ mean + 0.675 * standard deviation\n\nUsing the given mean (80) and standard deviation (10):\n- Q1 ≈ 80 - 0.675 * 10 ≈ 80 - 6.75 ≈ 73.25\n- Q3 ≈ 80 + 0.675 * 10 ≈ 80 + 6.75 ≈ 86.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 86.75 - 73.25 = 13.5\n\nNext, we'll find the lower and upper bounds for outliers using the 1.5*IQR rule:\n- Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 73.25 - 1.5 * 13.5 ≈ 53.5\n- Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 86.75 + 1.5 * 13.5 ≈ 106.5\n\nFinally, we can determine the outliers in the data set:\n- Scores below 53.5 and above 106.5 are considered outliers.\n\nSince the scores range from 50 to 95, the only outlier in this data set is the score of 50."
