    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular polygon, we simply multiply the length of one side by the number of sides. In this case, the polygon has 10 sides, each measuring 8 cm.\n\nPerimeter = (Number of sides) × (Length of one side)\nPerimeter = 10 × 8 cm\nPerimeter = 80 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the polygon is 80 cm."
