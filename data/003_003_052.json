    "message_2": "To find the exact value of cos(π/3) using the unit circle, we need to recall that the unit circle has a radius of 1 and is centered at the origin (0,0) of the coordinate plane. The angle π/3 (or 60 degrees) is in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane.\n\nThe coordinates of a point on the unit circle can be represented as (cos(θ), sin(θ)), where θ is the angle in radians. In this case, θ = π/3.\n\nWe can use the 30-60-90 triangle properties to find the coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to the angle π/3. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. Since the hypotenuse of the triangle is the radius of the unit circle (which is 1), we can find the lengths of the other two sides by dividing the sides of the 30-60-90 triangle by 2.\n\nSo, the side opposite the 30-degree angle (which is half the hypotenuse) is 1/2, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle (which is √3 times half the hypotenuse) is (√3)/2.\n\nSince the angle π/3 is in the first quadrant, both the x and y coordinates will be positive. Therefore, the coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to the angle π/3 are (cos(π/3), sin(π/3)) = (1/2, (√3)/2).\n\nNow, we can find the exact value of cos(π/3) by looking at the x-coordinate of the point:\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2"
