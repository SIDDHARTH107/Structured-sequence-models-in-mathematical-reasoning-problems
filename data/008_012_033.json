    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to represent the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 5  6  7 |\n    | 8  9 10 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 12 |\n    | 24 |\n    | 36 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). If A^(-1) exists, we can multiply both sides of the equation by A^(-1) to get X = A^(-1)B.\n\nTo find the inverse of A, we need to calculate its determinant first. If the determinant is non-zero, the inverse exists.\n\nThe determinant of A, det(A), is:\n\ndet(A) = 2(6*10 - 7*9) - 3(5*10 - 7*8) + 4(5*9 - 6*8)\n       = 2(60 - 63) - 3(50 - 56) + 4(45 - 48)\n       = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 4(-3)\n       = -6 + 18 - 12\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the inverse of A does not exist. Therefore, we cannot solve this system of linear equations using inverse matrices. The given system of equations is either inconsistent (no solutions) or dependent (infinitely many solutions)."
