We are looking for the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies this theorem.\n\nLet's check the prime numbers starting from the smallest one:\n\nFor p = 2:\n(2-1)! = 1! = 1\n1 ≡ -1 (mod 2) is true.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies Wilson's theorem is 2."
