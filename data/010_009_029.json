    "message_2": "To subdivide a regular tetrahedron with edge length 2 units into smaller tetrahedra with edge length 1 unit, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Connect the midpoints of each of the six edges of the original tetrahedron. This will create four smaller tetrahedra at each of the vertices of the original tetrahedron, and one smaller octahedron in the center.\n\n2. Now, we can subdivide the central octahedron into four smaller tetrahedra by connecting the midpoints of its edges.\n\nIn total, we have created 4 tetrahedra at the vertices and 4 tetrahedra from the central octahedron, resulting in a total of 4 + 4 = 8 tetrahedra in the subdivision."
