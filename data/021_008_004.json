    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to a system of nonlinear equations, we first need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is a matrix of partial derivatives of the functions with respect to the variables. In this case, our functions are:\n\nf1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 20\nf2(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 4\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n    | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ = | 2x  2y |\n    | 2x -2y |\n\nNow, we need to choose an initial guess for the solution (x0, y0). Let's choose (x0, y0) = (1, 1) as our initial guess. We will then iterate using the following formula:\n\n(x1, y1) = (x0, y0) - J^(-1) * F(x0, y0)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the vector of functions [f1(x, y), f2(x, y)] and J^(-1) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. We will iterate until the difference between consecutive approximations is less than 10^(-4).\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix:\n\nJ^(-1) = 1/(2x * (-2y) - 2y * 2x) * | -2y  -2y |\n                                      | -2x   2x |\n\nSince the determinant is zero, we cannot find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. Therefore, we cannot use Newton's method to solve this system of nonlinear equations."
