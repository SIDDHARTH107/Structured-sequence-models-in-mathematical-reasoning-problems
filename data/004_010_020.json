    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 5x² + 9x - 3, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the given function, we have three terms: 5x², 9x, and -3. We will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\n1) Antiderivative of 5x²:\nUsing the power rule, n = 2, so the antiderivative is (5x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (5x^3)/3.\n\n2) Antiderivative of 9x:\nUsing the power rule, n = 1, so the antiderivative is (9x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (9x^2)/2.\n\n3) Antiderivative of -3:\nSince -3 is a constant, its antiderivative is -3x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = (5x^3)/3 + (9x^2)/2 - 3x + C"
