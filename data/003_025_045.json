    "message_2": "To find the plane's groundspeed and direction relative to the ground, we can use vector addition. We will represent the plane's airspeed and the wind speed as vectors and then add them to find the resulting groundspeed vector.\n\nLet A represent the plane's airspeed vector and W represent the wind speed vector. We can break down these vectors into their x and y components:\n\nAx = A * cos(40°) = 500 * cos(40°) ≈ 383.02 km/hr\nAy = A * sin(40°) = 500 * sin(40°) ≈ 321.39 km/hr\n\nWx = W * cos(320° - 360°) = 80 * cos(-40°) ≈ 61.24 km/hr\nWy = W * sin(320° - 360°) = 80 * sin(-40°) ≈ -51.71 km/hr\n\nNow, we can add the x and y components of the vectors A and W to find the groundspeed vector G:\n\nGx = Ax + Wx = 383.02 + 61.24 ≈ 444.26 km/hr\nGy = Ay + Wy = 321.39 - 51.71 ≈ 269.68 km/hr\n\nNow that we have the x and y components of the groundspeed vector G, we can find its magnitude (groundspeed) and direction (bearing) using the Pythagorean theorem and the arctangent function:\n\nGroundspeed = |G| = √(Gx^2 + Gy^2) = √(444.26^2 + 269.68^2) ≈ 514.97 km/hr\n\nBearing = arctan(Gy/Gx) = arctan(269.68/444.26) ≈ 31.34°\n\nSince the groundspeed vector is in the first quadrant, we can use the bearing as is:\n\nBearing = 31.34°\n\nSo, the plane's groundspeed is approximately 514.97 km/hr, and its bearing relative to the ground is approximately 31.34°."
