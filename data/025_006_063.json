    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$, we will use the long exact sequence associated with the exponential sequence of sheaves on $X$. The exponential sequence is given by:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathcal{O}_X \\xrightarrow{exp(2\\pi i)} \\mathcal{O}_X^* \\to 0$$\n\nTaking the cohomology of this sequence, we get the long exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\to H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\to H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nNow, we compute the relevant cohomology groups:\n\n1. $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, since $X$ is connected.\n2. $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\mathbb{C}$, since $X$ is a smooth projective curve and the global sections of $\\mathcal{O}_X$ are just the constant functions.\n3. $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) = \\mathbb{C}^*$, since the global sections of $\\mathcal{O}_X^*$ are the nonzero constant functions.\n4. $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, since $X$ is a smooth projective curve and the first cohomology group of a curve with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is trivial.\n5. $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*)$ is the Picard group of $X$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, since $X$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $1$.\n\nNow, we can analyze the long exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{f} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{g} \\mathbb{C}^* \\to 0 \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\cdots$$\n\nThe map $f$ is the inclusion of the constant integer functions into the constant complex functions, and the map $g$ is the exponential map. Since the exponential map is surjective, we have that the kernel of the next map in the sequence is trivial. Thus, we have the following short exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$$\n\nThis implies that $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
