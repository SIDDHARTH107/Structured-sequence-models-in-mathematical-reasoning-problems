    "message_1": "What is the probability that a network with 100 computers will experience a ransomware attack in the next 24 hours if such attacks occur on average once per month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, ransomware attacks) that occur in a fixed interval of time (24 hours) given a known average rate of occurrence (once per month).\n\nFirst, we need to find the average rate of occurrence (位) for the 24-hour period. Since there is an average of 1 attack per month (30 days), we can calculate the average rate for 24 hours as follows:\n\n位 = (1 attack / 30 days) * (1 day / 24 hours) = 1/30 attacks per day\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson probability formula to find the probability of a ransomware attack occurring in the next 24 hours:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-位) * (位^x)) / x!\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least one attack (x = 1) occurring in the next 24 hours:\n\nP(1) = (e^(-1/30) * (1/30)^1) / 1! = (0.967 * 0.0333) / 1 = 0.0322\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring in the next 24 hours is approximately 3.22%."
