    "message_1": "A market has 200 potential customers with a probability of 0.4 buying a product. What is the probability that at least 80 customers will buy the product?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 80 customers will buy the product, we can use the binomial probability formula and sum the probabilities from 80 to 200 customers.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (customers buying the product)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of trials (potential customers)\n- k is the number of successes (customers buying the product)\n- p is the probability of success (0.4 in this case)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 80 customers will buy the product, so we need to sum the probabilities from k = 80 to k = 200:\n\nP(X >= 80) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 80 to 200\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use statistical software or a calculator with a built-in binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the result.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we can find the complement probability P(X < 80) using the binomial CDF, and then subtract it from 1 to get the desired probability:\n\nP(X >= 80) = 1 - P(X < 80)\n\nUsing a binomial CDF calculator, we find that P(X < 80) ≈ 0.0574.\n\nSo, the probability that at least 80 customers will buy the product is:\n\nP(X >= 80) = 1 - 0.0574 ≈ 0.9426\n\nTherefore, there is approximately a 94.26% chance that at least 80 customers will buy the product."
