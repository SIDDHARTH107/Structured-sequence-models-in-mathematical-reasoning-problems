    "message_2": "The Hopf bifurcation theorem states that a dynamical system can have at most n/2 limit cycles, where n is the number of variables in the system. In the case of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction with 5 variables, the maximum number of limit cycles according to the Hopf bifurcation theorem would be:\n\n5/2 = 2.5\n\nSince the number of limit cycles must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:\n\nMaximum number of limit cycles = 2"
