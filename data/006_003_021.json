    "message_2": "The probability of drawing a king from a deck of 52 cards with 4 kings is calculated by dividing the number of successful outcomes (drawing a king) by the total number of possible outcomes (drawing any card from the deck).\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, there are 4 successful outcomes (drawing any of the 4 kings) and 52 possible outcomes (drawing any of the 52 cards).\n\nProbability = 4/52\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 1/13\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a king from a deck of 52 cards is 1/13 or approximately 0.0769 or 7.69%."
