    "message_1": "Suppose a football team has a 60% chance of winning a game, a 30% chance of tying and 10% chance of losing. If they win the first game of a season, what is the probability that they will win their next three games consecutively?",
    "message_2": "Since the team has already won the first game, we only need to calculate the probability of them winning the next three games consecutively. The probability of winning each game is independent of the others, so we can simply multiply the probabilities together.\n\nProbability of winning 3 games consecutively = (Probability of winning 1 game) ^ 3\n= (0.60) ^ 3\n= 0.216\n\nSo, there is a 21.6% chance that the team will win their next three games consecutively after winning the first game."
