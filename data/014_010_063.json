Instead, a more complex substitution cipher was used, where each letter is replaced by a different letter with no consistent shift pattern.\n\nNow that we have the substitution pattern, we can decrypt the original message:\n\nC -> L\nR -> B\nY -> C\nP -> X\nT -> N\nO -> B\nG -> T\nR -> V\nA -> M\nP -> M\nH -> R\nY -> X\n\nThe decrypted message is \"LBCXNBTVMMRX\"."
