    "message_2": "To determine whether the formula ∃x∀yϕ(x,y) is true or false in the standard interpretation of the natural numbers, let's first analyze the formula ϕ(x,y).\n\nϕ(x,y) = ∀P(∀xP(x) ∧ ∃yP(y))\n\nThis formula states that for any property P, if all natural numbers x have property P, then there exists a natural number y with property P. This is a tautology, as it is always true: if all natural numbers have a certain property, then it is obvious that there exists at least one natural number with that property.\n\nNow, let's consider the formula ∃x∀yϕ(x,y). This formula states that there exists a natural number x such that for all natural numbers y, ϕ(x,y) holds. Since ϕ(x,y) is a tautology and is always true, it doesn't matter which natural number x we choose, ϕ(x,y) will always hold for all natural numbers y.\n\nTherefore, the formula ∃x∀yϕ(x,y) is true in the standard interpretation of the natural numbers."
