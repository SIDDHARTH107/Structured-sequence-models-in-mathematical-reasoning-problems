They collect the following data on annual salaries:\n\nProfession A: $45,000, $55,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000\nProfession B: $30,000, $25,000, $50,000, $55,000, $35,000\n\nHowever, they realize that one of the salaries in each profession was recorded incorrectly. In Profession A, the $70,000 salary was actually $80,000. In Profession B, the $25,000 salary was actually $35,000.\n\nUsing robust statistics, what is the median salary for each profession after correcting the errors?",
    "message_2": "To find the median salary for each profession, we first need to arrange the salaries in ascending order and then find the middle value.\n\nProfession A (corrected): $45,000, $50,000, $55,000, $60,000, $80,000\nProfession B (corrected): $30,000, $35,000, $35,000, $50,000, $55,000\n\nThe median salary for Profession A is $55,000, and the median salary for Profession B is $35,000."
