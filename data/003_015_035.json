    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 4sin(3x + π/4), we need to analyze the function in terms of its sine component.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine term. In this case, the amplitude is the absolute value of 4, which is 4.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the variable x inside the sine term. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of x. In this case, B = 3. So, the period is (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3.\n\nThus, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 4sin(3x + π/4) is 4, and the period is (2π) / 3."
