    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by the curve y = x^3 and the x-axis on the interval [0, 2] about the y-axis, we will use the method of cylindrical shells. \n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y. Since y = x^3, we have x = y^(1/3).\n\nNow, we will set up the integral for the volume using the formula for the method of cylindrical shells:\n\nV = 2 * pi * ∫[x * y'(x) * dx] from a to b\n\nIn our case, a = 0 and b = 2. We have x = y^(1/3), so we need to find y'(x). To do this, we differentiate y = x^3 with respect to x:\n\ny'(x) = 3x^2\n\nNow we can substitute x = y^(1/3) into the expression for y'(x):\n\ny'(y^(1/3)) = 3(y^(1/3))^2 = 3y^(2/3)\n\nNow we can set up the integral:\n\nV = 2 * pi * ∫[y^(1/3) * 3y^(2/3) * dy] from y = 0 to y = 8 (since x = 2 corresponds to y = 2^3 = 8)\n\nV = 6 * pi * ∫[y^(1/3) * y^(2/3) * dy] from 0 to 8\n\nV = 6 * pi * ∫[y * dy] from 0 to 8\n\nNow we can integrate:\n\nV = 6 * pi * [y^2 / 2] from 0 to 8\n\nV = 6 * pi * [(8^2 / 2) - (0^2 / 2)]\n\nV = 6 * pi * (64 / 2)\n\nV = 6 * pi * 32\n\nV = 192 * pi\n\nSo, the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by the curve y = x^3 and the x-axis on the interval [0, 2] about the y-axis is 192 * pi cubic units."
