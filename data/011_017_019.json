    "message_1": "Consider a 3x3 Latin square, where each cell contains a single digit from 1-3. How many distinct Latin squares of this size are possible?",
    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\n\nFor a 3x3 Latin square, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. First, we need to fill the first row. We have 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the numbers 1, 2, and 3. That is, 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\n2. Now, let's fill the second row. The first number in the second row must be different from the first number in the first row. So, we have 2 choices for the first number in the second row. For the second number in the second row, we have only 1 choice left (it must be different from the second number in the first row and the first number in the second row). Finally, the third number in the second row is determined by the remaining number. So, we have 2 × 1 = 2 ways to fill the second row.\n\n3. The third row is now determined by the numbers in the first two rows, as each number must appear exactly once in each column. So, there is only 1 way to fill the third row.\n\nMultiplying the possibilities for each row, we get the total number of distinct 3x3 Latin squares:\n\n6 (first row) × 2 (second row) × 1 (third row) = 12 distinct 3x3 Latin squares."
