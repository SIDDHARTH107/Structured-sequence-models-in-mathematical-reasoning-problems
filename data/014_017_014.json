    "message_1": "A cryptographer intercepted an encrypted message that was encoded using a Caesar cipher. She suspects that the letter \"e\" was the most frequently used letter in the original message before encryption. Upon performing frequency analysis on the ciphered text, she notices that the letter \"x\" is the most frequently used letter. Assuming that the original letter \"e\" was shifted forward by 8 letters in the encryption process, what was the original message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to shift each letter in the encrypted message back by 8 positions. Since we don't have the actual encrypted message, we can only provide the general decryption process.\n\n1. For each letter in the encrypted message, find its position in the alphabet (e.g., A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).\n2. Subtract 8 from the position of each letter.\n3. If the result is less than 1, add 26 to the result to wrap around the alphabet.\n4. Convert the new positions back to their corresponding letters.\n\nApplying this process to the encrypted message will reveal the original message."
