    "message_2": "To compute the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric, we will use the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by the following formula:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$$\n\nFirst, let's compute the inverse metric $g^{ij}$. Since the given metric is diagonal, the inverse metric will also be diagonal, with the diagonal elements being the reciprocals of the diagonal elements of the original metric:\n\n$$g^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & e^{-2z} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we will compute the non-zero Christoffel symbols. We only need to consider the non-zero components of the metric and their derivatives:\n\n1. $\\Gamma^z_{zz} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{zz} (\\partial_z g_{zz}) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{-2z} (2 e^{2z}) = 1$\n\n2. $\\Gamma^z_{xz} = \\Gamma^z_{zx} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{zz} (\\partial_x g_{zz}) = 0$ (since $\\partial_x g_{zz} = 0$)\n\n3. $\\Gamma^z_{yz} = \\Gamma^z_{zy} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{zz} (\\partial_y g_{zz}) = 0$ (since $\\partial_y g_{zz} = 0$)\n\n4. $\\Gamma^x_{xz} = \\Gamma^x_{zx} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{xx} (\\partial_z g_{xx}) = 0$ (since $\\partial_z g_{xx} = 0$)\n\n5. $\\Gamma^y_{yz} = \\Gamma^y_{zy} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{yy} (\\partial_z g_{yy}) = 0$ (since $\\partial_z g_{yy} = 0$)\n\nAll other Christoffel symbols are zero, since the metric is diagonal and the off-diagonal elements are zero.\n\nSo, the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric are:\n\n$$\\Gamma^z_{zz} = 1$$\n\nAll other components are zero."
