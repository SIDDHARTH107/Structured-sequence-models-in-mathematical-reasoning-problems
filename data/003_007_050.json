    "message_2": "Let the triangle have vertices A, B, and C, with side lengths AB = 7, BC = 10, and AC = 13. We want to find the largest angle, which is the angle opposite the longest side. In this case, the longest side is AC, so we want to find angle B.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find angle B:\n\ncos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\ncos(B) = (7^2 + 10^2 - 13^2) / (2 * 7 * 10)\n\ncos(B) = (49 + 100 - 169) / (140)\n\ncos(B) = (-20) / (140)\n\ncos(B) = -1/7\n\nNow, we need to find the angle B whose cosine is -1/7. We can use the inverse cosine function (also called arccos or cos^(-1)) to find this angle:\n\nB = arccos(-1/7)\n\nB ≈ 97.41°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 97.41°."
