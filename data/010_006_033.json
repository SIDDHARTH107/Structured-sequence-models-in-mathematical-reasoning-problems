    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the unit circle $S^1$ at the base point $(1,0)$, we will use the fact that the fundamental group of $S^1$ is isomorphic to the group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nConsider a loop in $S^1$ based at $(1,0)$. We can parametrize this loop by a continuous map $f: [0,1] \\to S^1$ such that $f(0) = f(1) = (1,0)$. Now, we can think of this loop as \"winding\" around the circle a certain number of times. If the loop winds around the circle $n$ times in the counterclockwise direction, we will associate it with the integer $n$. If it winds around $n$ times in the clockwise direction, we will associate it with the integer $-n$. If the loop does not wind around the circle at all (i.e., it is contractible to a point), we will associate it with the integer $0$.\n\nNow, we can define a group operation on these loops by concatenating them. Given two loops $f$ and $g$ associated with the integers $n$ and $m$, respectively, we can define a new loop $h$ by traversing $f$ first and then $g$. This new loop will wind around the circle $n+m$ times, so it will be associated with the integer $n+m$. This operation is associative, and the identity element is the constant loop at $(1,0)$, which is associated with the integer $0$. The inverse of a loop $f$ associated with the integer $n$ is the loop that winds around the circle $-n$ times.\n\nThus, we have a group isomorphism between the set of loops in $S^1$ based at $(1,0)$ and the group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^1, (1,0))$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$."
