    "message_2": "A twin prime pair consists of two prime numbers that differ by 2. To find the smallest twin prime pair greater than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 100 and see if their neighbors (either 2 less or 2 more) are also prime.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 100 is 101. However, 101 - 2 = 99 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 33), and 101 + 2 = 103 is prime. So, the smallest twin prime pair greater than 100 is (101, 103)."
