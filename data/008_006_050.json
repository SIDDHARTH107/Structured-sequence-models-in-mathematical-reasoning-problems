    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[4 - λ, 1], [1, 4 - λ]]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (4 - λ)(4 - λ) - (1)(1) = λ^2 - 8λ + 15\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 8λ + 15 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored as:\n\n(λ - 3)(λ - 5) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = 5.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\n1. For λ1 = 3:\n\n(A - λ1I) * v1 = 0\n([[4 - 3, 1], [1, 4 - 3]]) * v1 = 0\n([[1, 1], [1, 1]]) * v1 = 0\n\nLet v1 = [x1, y1]. Then, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\nx1 + y1 = 0\nx1 + y1 = 0\n\nThe second equation is the same as the first one, so we only need to consider one of them. We can choose y1 = -x1. Let x1 = 1, then y1 = -1. So, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 = 3 is:\n\nv1 = [1, -1]\n\n2. For λ2 = 5:\n\n(A - λ2I) * v2 = 0\n([[4 - 5, 1], [1, 4 - 5]]) * v2 = 0\n([[-1, 1], [1, -1]]) * v2 = 0\n\nLet v2 = [x2, y2]. Then, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n-x2 + y2 = 0\nx2 - y2 = 0\n\nThe second equation is the same as the first one, so we only need to consider one of them. We can choose y2 = x2. Let x2 = 1, then y2 = 1. So, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 = 5 is:\n\nv2 = [1, 1]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 3 with eigenvector v1 = [1, -1]\nEigenvalue λ2 = 5 with eigenvector v2 = [1, 1]"
