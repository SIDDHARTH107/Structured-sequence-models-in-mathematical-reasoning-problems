    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ of the given differential form $\\omega$, we will apply the rules of exterior differentiation to each term in $\\omega$. Recall that the exterior derivative is a linear operation and satisfies the product rule for wedge products.\n\nThe exterior derivative of a 0-form (function) is its differential, and the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form. We have:\n\n$d(x) = dx$\n$d(y) = dy$\n$d(z) = dz$\n\nNow, we compute the exterior derivative of $\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = d(x \\, dy \\wedge dz + y \\, dz \\wedge dx + z \\, dx \\wedge dy)$\n\nApplying linearity and the product rule for wedge products, we get:\n\n$d\\omega = (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + x \\, d(dy \\wedge dz)) + (dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + y \\, d(dz \\wedge dx)) + (dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + z \\, d(dx \\wedge dy))$\n\nNow, we compute the exterior derivatives of the 2-forms:\n\n$d(dy \\wedge dz) = d(dy) \\wedge dz - dy \\wedge d(dz) = 0$\n$d(dz \\wedge dx) = d(dz) \\wedge dx - dz \\wedge d(dx) = 0$\n$d(dx \\wedge dy) = d(dx) \\wedge dy - dx \\wedge d(dy) = 0$\n\nThese are all zero because the exterior derivative of a coordinate 1-form is zero, and the wedge product of a form with itself is zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$d\\omega = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + 0 + 0 + dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + 0 + 0 + dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + 0$\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$d\\omega = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$\n\nThis is the exterior derivative of the given differential form $\\omega$ on the smooth manifold $M$."
