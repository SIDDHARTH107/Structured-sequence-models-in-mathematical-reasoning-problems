    "message_1": "A teacher wants to create a table for a group project. The table has 8 seats and the teacher wants to form groups of 4 students each. Construct a block design, denoted as $(8,4,1)$ which represents the number of groups that can be formed and the number of times each pair of students will work together on the project.",
    "message_2": "A $(v, k, λ)$ block design is a set of v elements (in this case, students) and a collection of k-element subsets (in this case, groups of 4 students) such that each pair of distinct elements appears together in λ blocks (in this case, each pair of students works together once).\n\nFor this problem, we have a $(8, 4, 1)$ block design, which means we have 8 students, we want to form groups of 4, and each pair of students should work together exactly once.\n\nLet's label the students as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. We can construct the following block design:\n\n1. Group 1: {A, B, C, D}\n2. Group 2: {E, F, G, H}\n3. Group 3: {A, E, C, F}\n4. Group 4: {B, G, D, H}\n5. Group 5: {A, G, C, H}\n6. Group 6: {B, E, D, F}\n7. Group 7: {A, F, B, H}\n8. Group 8: {C, E, D, G}\n\nIn this design, each pair of students appears together in exactly one group. For example, the pair (A, B) appears in Group 1, the pair (A, C) appears in Group 1, and the pair (A, D) appears in Group 1. Similarly, the pair (A, E) appears in Group 3, and so on. You can verify that all other pairs of students also appear together exactly once in this design."
