    "message_2": "The number of ways to place eight rooks on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other is equivalent to the number of permutations of the numbers 1 through 8, which is 8! (8 factorial). This is because each rook must be placed in a different row and column, and there are 8 choices for the first rook, 7 choices for the second rook, and so on, down to 1 choice for the last rook.\n\nNow, we want to express this answer in terms of Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nTo express 8! in terms of Catalan numbers, we need to find a value of n such that 8! is a multiple of the numerator of the Catalan number formula, i.e., 2n! is a multiple of 8!.\n\nLet's try n = 4:\n\nC(4) = (1/5) * (8! / (4! * 4!))\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get:\n\n5 * C(4) = 8! / (4! * 4!)\n\nNow, we need to find a multiple of (4! * 4!) that is equal to 8!. Since 8! = 40320 and 4! * 4! = 576, we can divide 40320 by 576 to see if it is a multiple:\n\n40320 / 576 = 70\n\nSo, 8! = 70 * (4! * 4!)\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to place eight rooks on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other can be expressed in terms of Catalan numbers as:\n\n8! = 70 * C(4)"
