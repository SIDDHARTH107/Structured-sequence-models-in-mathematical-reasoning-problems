    "message_2": "To find out how many students do not participate in either sport, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of students = Number of students who play soccer + Number of students who play basketball - Number of students who play both sports\n\nTotal number of students = 20 (soccer) + 15 (basketball) - 10 (both)\n\nTotal number of students = 35 - 10 = 25\n\nNow, we know that there are 30 students in the class, and 25 of them participate in at least one sport. Therefore, the number of students who do not participate in either sport is:\n\n30 (total students) - 25 (students who play at least one sport) = 5 students\n\nSo, 5 students in the class do not participate in either sport."
