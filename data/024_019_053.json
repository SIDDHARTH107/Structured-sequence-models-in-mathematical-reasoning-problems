    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total curvature of a surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic of the surface. For a cone, the Euler characteristic is 1, so the total curvature of the surface of the cone is 2π(1) = 2π.\n\nHowever, we need to find the total curvature of the surface of the cone that encloses the inscribed sphere. To do this, we need to find the angle at the apex of the cone.\n\nLet's denote the radius of the base of the cone as R, the height of the cone as H, and the slant height as L. We know that L = 10 cm and the radius of the inscribed sphere is 5 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nR^2 + H^2 = L^2\n\nSince the sphere is inscribed in the cone, the height of the cone is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 10 cm. So, H = 10 cm.\n\nNow we can solve for R:\n\nR^2 + (10)^2 = (10)^2\nR^2 = 0\nR = 0\n\nThis means that the base of the cone is a point, and the cone is actually a right circular cone with a 90-degree angle at the apex.\n\nNow, we can find the total curvature of the surface of the cone that encloses the inscribed sphere. The total curvature of a cone is given by the formula:\n\nK = 2π(1 - cos(α/2))\n\nwhere α is the angle at the apex of the cone. In this case, α = 90 degrees, so:\n\nK = 2π(1 - cos(90/2))\nK = 2π(1 - cos(45))\nK = 2π(1 - √2/2)\nK = 2π(2 - √2)/2\nK = π(2 - √2)\n\nSo, the total curvature of the surface of the cone that encloses the inscribed sphere is π(2 - √2)."
