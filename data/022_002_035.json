    "message_2": "To find the conformal map w(z) that maps circle A onto circle B, we can use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\nw(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex constants.\n\nWe are given that w(0) = 2, so we can plug in z = 0 to find the relationship between b and d:\n\n2 = b / d\n\nNow, we need to find the transformation that maps the circle A onto circle B. Since both circles have the same radius, the transformation should preserve the radius. Therefore, we can consider the points where the circles intersect. Let's call these points P and Q. The intersection points can be found by solving the system of equations for the two circles:\n\n|z|^2 = 4 (circle A)\n|(z - 2)|^2 = 4 (circle B)\n\nSolving this system, we find that the intersection points are P = 1 + i and Q = 1 - i.\n\nNow, we need to find a Möbius transformation that maps P to P and Q to Q. Let's plug in P into the transformation:\n\nw(P) = w(1 + i) = (a(1 + i) + b) / (c(1 + i) + d)\n\nSince w(P) = P, we have:\n\n(1 + i) = (a(1 + i) + b) / (c(1 + i) + d)\n\nSimilarly, for Q:\n\nw(Q) = w(1 - i) = (a(1 - i) + b) / (c(1 - i) + d)\n\nSince w(Q) = Q, we have:\n\n(1 - i) = (a(1 - i) + b) / (c(1 - i) + d)\n\nNow we have a system of equations with four complex constants a, b, c, and d. We can use the fact that 2 = b / d to simplify the system:\n\n(1 + i) = (a(1 + i) + 2d) / (c(1 + i) + d)\n(1 - i) = (a(1 - i) + 2d) / (c(1 - i) + d)\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that a = 1, b = 2, c = -1, and d = 1. Therefore, the conformal map w(z) is:\n\nw(z) = (z + 2) / (-z + 1)"
