    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 2^(3x-1) = 16, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation with the same base on both sides. Since 16 can be written as 2^4, the equation becomes:\n\n2^(3x-1) = 2^4\n\n2. Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n3x - 1 = 4\n\n3. Solve for x:\n\n3x = 5\nx = 5/3\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation 2^(3x-1) = 16 is x = 5/3."
