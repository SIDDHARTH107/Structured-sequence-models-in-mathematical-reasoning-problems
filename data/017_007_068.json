If a group has an element of order 6, it is isomorphic to C6.\n2. If a group has an element of order 3 and an element of order 2, it is isomorphic to D3.\n\nLet G be a group with 6 elements. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. We know that there is always an identity element of order 1 in G.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 6.\nIf G has an element of order 6, say g, then G is generated by g, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 6.\nIn this case, G must have elements of order 2 and 3. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3. Then, we have:\n\na^2 = e\nb^3 = e\n\nSince G has 6 elements, and the only divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of the product ab must be a divisor of 6. We know that (ab)^2 ≠ e and (ab)^3 ≠ e, so the order of ab must be 6. However, this contradicts our assumption that G has no elements of order 6. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nSo, we are left with the case where G has an element of order 6, and thus G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G has elements of order 2 and 3. We can construct the dihedral group D3 as follows:\n\nD3 = {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2}\nwhere a^2 = e, b^3 = e, and a * b = b^2 * a.\n\nWe can define a mapping φ: G → D3 such that φ(g) = g for all g in G. This mapping is bijective, and it preserves the group operation:\n\nφ(gh) = gh = φ(g)φ(h) for all g, h in G.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group G has 6 elements, it is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
