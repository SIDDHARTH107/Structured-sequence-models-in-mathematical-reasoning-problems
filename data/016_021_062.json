    "message_1": "A Sierpinski arrowhead curve is formed by removing the central third of a triangle and replacing it with two smaller triangles, joined at the base. \n\nIf we start with an equilateral triangle of side length 9 cm, how many line segments will be in the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after 4 iterations of this process?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the number of line segments in each iteration:\n\nIteration 0: We start with an equilateral triangle, which has 3 line segments.\n\nIteration 1: We remove the central third of the triangle and replace it with two smaller triangles. This adds 3 new line segments, so we have a total of 3 + 3 = 6 line segments.\n\nIteration 2: We apply the process to each of the 3 smaller triangles from the previous iteration. Each triangle will add 3 new line segments, so we have a total of 6 + 3 * 3 = 15 line segments.\n\nIteration 3: We apply the process to each of the 9 smaller triangles from the previous iteration. Each triangle will add 3 new line segments, so we have a total of 15 + 9 * 3 = 42 line segments.\n\nIteration 4: We apply the process to each of the 27 smaller triangles from the previous iteration. Each triangle will add 3 new line segments, so we have a total of 42 + 27 * 3 = 123 line segments.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, there will be 123 line segments in the Sierpinski arrowhead curve."
