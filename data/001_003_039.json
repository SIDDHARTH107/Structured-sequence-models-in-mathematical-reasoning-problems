    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\n3x + 2y = 10\n\n3x = 10 - 2y\n\nx = (10 - 2y) / 3\n\nNow we will substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n4x - 5y = -9\n\n4((10 - 2y) / 3) - 5y = -9\n\nNow we will solve for y:\n\n(40 - 8y) / 3 - 5y = -9\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n40 - 8y - 15y = -27\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-23y = -67\n\nDivide by -23:\n\ny = 67 / 23\n\ny = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression for x:\n\nx = (10 - 2y) / 3\n\nx = (10 - 2(3)) / 3\n\nx = (10 - 6) / 3\n\nx = 4 / 3\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4/3 and y = 3."
