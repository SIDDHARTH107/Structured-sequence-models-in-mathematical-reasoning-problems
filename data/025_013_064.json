    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(-1,0)$, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. We can do this using implicit differentiation.\n\nGiven the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x$, we differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:\n\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 8x + 4$\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point $(-1,0)$. We plug in the coordinates $(-1,0)$ into the equation:\n\n$2(0) \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(-1)^2 + 8(-1) + 4$\n\n$0 = 3 - 8 + 4$\n\nFrom this equation, we find that $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ at the point $(-1,0)$.\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\nPlugging in the point $(-1,0)$ and the slope $m = 0$:\n\n$y - 0 = 0(x - (-1))$\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y = 0$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(-1,0)$ is $y = 0$."
