    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the network system using the Fourier transform, we need to analyze the input and output signals in the frequency domain.\n\nLet's denote the input signal as x(t) and the output signal as y(t). Their Fourier transforms are X(f) and Y(f), respectively. The transfer function, H(f), is defined as the ratio of the output signal's Fourier transform to the input signal's Fourier transform:\n\nH(f) = Y(f) / X(f)\n\nGiven that the input signal has a frequency of 100 Hz and the output signal has a frequency of 200 Hz, we can represent the input and output signals as:\n\nx(t) = A * sin(2 * π * 100 * t)\ny(t) = B * sin(2 * π * 200 * t)\n\nwhere A and B are the amplitudes of the input and output signals, respectively.\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transforms of x(t) and y(t). The Fourier transform of a sinusoidal function is given by:\n\nX(f) = (A/2) * [δ(f - 100) - δ(f + 100)]\nY(f) = (B/2) * [δ(f - 200) - δ(f + 200)]\n\nwhere δ(f) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(f):\n\nH(f) = Y(f) / X(f)\n\nTo find the transfer function at the specific frequencies of interest (100 Hz and 200 Hz), we can evaluate H(f) at those frequencies:\n\nH(100) = Y(100) / X(100) = 0\nH(200) = Y(200) / X(200) = (B/2) / (A/2) = B / A\n\nThe transfer function H(f) is zero at 100 Hz and B/A at 200 Hz. In general, the transfer function will be a combination of these values at the respective frequencies. However, without more information about the specific network system, we cannot provide a more detailed expression for H(f)."
