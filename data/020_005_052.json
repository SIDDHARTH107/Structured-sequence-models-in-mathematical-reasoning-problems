    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product X and Product Y. The production of each product requires a certain amount of labor and raw materials. The company has 280 units of labor and 160 units of raw materials available each day. Product X generates a profit of $10 per unit, while Product Y generates a profit of $15 per unit. The company wants to determine how much of each product to produce each day in order to maximize profit.\n\nWrite a mathematical model to represent this problem and solve using integer programming. What is the maximum profit the company can earn per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product X produced per day and y be the number of units of Product Y produced per day. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The company has 280 units of labor available each day.\n2. The company has 160 units of raw materials available each day.\n3. Product X generates a profit of $10 per unit.\n4. Product Y generates a profit of $15 per unit.\n\nLet Lx and Ly be the labor required to produce one unit of Product X and Product Y, respectively. Similarly, let Rx and Ry be the raw materials required to produce one unit of Product X and Product Y, respectively.\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw materials can be represented as follows:\n\nLx * x + Ly * y ≤ 280 (Labor constraint)\nRx * x + Ry * y ≤ 160 (Raw materials constraint)\n\nSince the company wants to maximize profit, the objective function can be represented as:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nTo solve this problem using integer programming, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and maximize the objective function P. However, we are not given the values of Lx, Ly, Rx, and Ry, so we cannot provide a specific solution or maximum profit without this information.\n\nIf you provide the values of Lx, Ly, Rx, and Ry, we can proceed to solve the problem using integer programming techniques such as the branch and bound method or graphical methods."
