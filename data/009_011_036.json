    "message_1": "In a population of 10,000 people, a disease is spreading exponentially with a rate of 0.05 per day. If 500 people are infected on day 0, find the solution to the differential equation describing the spread of the disease and determine how many people will be infected after 7 days.",
    "message_2": "To model the spread of the disease, we can use the differential equation:\n\ndI/dt = k * I * (1 - I/N)\n\nwhere I is the number of infected people, t is time in days, k is the rate of spread (0.05 per day), and N is the total population (10,000 people).\n\nFirst, we need to find the solution to this differential equation. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndI/I * (1 - I/N) = k * dt\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n∫(dI/I * (1 - I/N)) = ∫(k * dt)\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\nA/I + B/(1 - I/N) = 1/I * (1 - I/N)\n\nMultiplying both sides by I * (1 - I/N), we get:\n\nA * (1 - I/N) + B * I = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in values for I:\n\nIf I = 0, A = 1\nIf I = N, B = -1/N\n\nSo, our partial fractions are:\n\n1/I - (1/N)/(1 - I/N)\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/I - (1/N)/(1 - I/N)) dI = ∫(k * dt)\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nln(I) - ln(1 - I/N) = kt + C\n\nCombining the logarithms, we have:\n\nln(I/(1 - I/N)) = kt + C\n\nNow, we can solve for I:\n\nI/(1 - I/N) = e^(kt + C)\n\nAt t = 0, I = 500, so we can solve for C:\n\n500/(1 - 500/10000) = e^(0 + C)\n\nC = ln(500/9500)\n\nNow, we can find the number of infected people after 7 days:\n\nI(t) = (1 - I/N) * e^(kt + C)\n\nI(7) = (1 - I/10000) * e^(0.05 * 7 + ln(500/9500))\n\nI(7) ≈ 966.42\n\nAfter 7 days, approximately 966 people will be infected."
