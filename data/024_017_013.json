    "message_2": "To determine the parallel transport of the vector V along the curve C, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C at each point. The tangent vector can be found by taking the derivative of the curve with respect to t:\n\nx'(t) = -sin(t)\ny'(t) = cos(t)\n\nSo, the tangent vector T(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t)).\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of V along C. The parallel transport of a vector is the vector that remains parallel to the original vector while moving along the curve. In this case, we want to find the vector that remains parallel to V while moving along C.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following formula for the parallel transport of a vector:\n\nV_parallel(t) = V - (V · T(t)) * T(t)\n\nwhere V_parallel(t) is the parallel transported vector at time t, V is the original vector, T(t) is the tangent vector at time t, and · denotes the dot product.\n\nNow, let's compute the dot product V · T(t):\n\nV · T(t) = (2,3) · (-sin(t), cos(t)) = -2sin(t) + 3cos(t)\n\nNow, we can find the parallel transported vector V_parallel(t):\n\nV_parallel(t) = (2,3) - (-2sin(t) + 3cos(t)) * (-sin(t), cos(t))\nV_parallel(t) = (2,3) - (-2sin^2(t) + 3cos^2(t), -2sin(t)cos(t) + 3cos^2(t))\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nV_parallel(t) = (2 + 2sin^2(t) - 3cos^2(t), 3 - 2sin(t)cos(t) - 3cos^2(t))\n\nThis is the parallel transported vector V along the curve C for t between 0 and π/2."
