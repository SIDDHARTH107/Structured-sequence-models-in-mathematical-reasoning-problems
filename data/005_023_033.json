    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers in the dataset using the interquartile range (IQR) method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the dataset in ascending order.\n2. Find the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2 or median), and the third quartile (Q3).\n3. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3.\n4. Find the lower and upper bounds for outliers by calculating Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR, respectively.\n5. Check if any data points fall outside the lower and upper bounds.\n\nStep 1: The dataset is already arranged in ascending order:\n{3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 21}\n\nStep 2: Find Q1, Q2, and Q3.\nSince there are 10 data points, we can find the quartiles as follows:\n- Q1 is the median of the first 5 numbers: (5+7)/2 = 6\n- Q2 (median) is the average of the 5th and 6th numbers: (11+12)/2 = 11.5\n- Q3 is the median of the last 5 numbers: (14+17)/2 = 15.5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the IQR.\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 15.5 - 6 = 9.5\n\nStep 4: Find the lower and upper bounds for outliers.\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 6 - 1.5 * 9.5 = 6 - 14.25 = -8.25\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 15.5 + 1.5 * 9.5 = 15.5 + 14.25 = 29.75\n\nStep 5: Check for outliers.\nAll data points in the dataset fall within the lower and upper bounds (-8.25 to 29.75), so there are no outliers in this dataset."
