    "message_2": "To solve the inequality, we will first isolate x by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 2x from both sides of the inequality:\n3 ≤ 5x - 5\n\n2. Add 5 to both sides of the inequality:\n8 ≤ 5x\n\n3. Divide both sides of the inequality by 5:\n8/5 ≤ x\n\nSo, the solution set for the inequality is x ≥ 8/5. On a number line, this can be represented by shading all the points to the right of 8/5, including 8/5 itself."
