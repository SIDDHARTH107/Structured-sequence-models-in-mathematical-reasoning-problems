If the center of the Ferris wheel is located 30 meters above the ground, write an equation to model the height of a person on the Ferris wheel as a function of time.  Then, use the equation to find the minimum and maximum height of a person on the Ferris wheel.",
    "message_2": "Let h(t) represent the height of a person on the Ferris wheel as a function of time t (in seconds). Since the Ferris wheel makes one revolution in 60 seconds, we can model the height using a sinusoidal function. We'll use the cosine function because it starts at its maximum value when t = 0.\n\nThe amplitude of the function is half the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which is 20 meters (half of 40 meters). The period of the function is 60 seconds, which is the time it takes for the Ferris wheel to make one revolution. The vertical shift is the height of the center of the Ferris wheel, which is 30 meters above the ground.\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is:\n\nh(t) = A * cos(B(t - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the horizontal shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, A = 20, B = 2π / 60, C = 0, and D = 30. So the equation for the height of a person on the Ferris wheel as a function of time is:\n\nh(t) = 20 * cos((2π / 60)t) + 30\n\nNow, let's find the minimum and maximum height of a person on the Ferris wheel.\n\nThe maximum height occurs when the cosine function is at its maximum value, which is 1. So,\n\nh_max = 20 * cos((2π / 60)t) + 30 = 20 * 1 + 30 = 50 meters\n\nThe minimum height occurs when the cosine function is at its minimum value, which is -1. So,\n\nh_min = 20 * cos((2π / 60)t) + 30 = 20 * (-1) + 30 = 10 meters\n\nTherefore, the minimum height of a person on the Ferris wheel is 10 meters, and the maximum height is 50 meters."
