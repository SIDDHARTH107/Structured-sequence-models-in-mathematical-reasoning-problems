Find an expression for the displacement of the mass as a function of time if the system experiences simple harmonic motion, and calculate the period of the motion.",
    "message_2": "For a mass-spring system experiencing simple harmonic motion, the displacement of the mass as a function of time can be described by the equation:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude of the motion, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nIn this case, the mass is initially at rest at a displacement of 0.05 meters from the equilibrium position, so the amplitude A = 0.05 meters. Since the mass is initially at its maximum displacement, the phase angle φ = 0.\n\nThe angular frequency ω can be found using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass. Plugging in the given values:\n\nω = sqrt(12 N/m / 0.1 kg) = sqrt(120 s^(-2)) = 10.95 rad/s\n\nNow we can write the expression for the displacement as a function of time:\n\nx(t) = 0.05 * cos(10.95t)\n\nTo find the period T of the motion, we can use the relationship between angular frequency and period:\n\nω = 2π/T\n\nSolving for T:\n\nT = 2π/ω = 2π/10.95 ≈ 0.573 s\n\nSo the period of the motion is approximately 0.573 seconds."
