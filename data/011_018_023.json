    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula. The multinomial coefficient is a generalization of the binomial coefficient and can be used to count the number of ways to divide a set of items into multiple groups of specific sizes.\n\nIn this case, we have 20 students and want to divide them into 5 groups of 4 students each. The multinomial coefficient formula is:\n\nC(n; k1, k2, ..., km) = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * km!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (students), k1, k2, ..., km are the sizes of the groups, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nFor our problem, n = 20, and we have 5 groups of size 4, so k1 = k2 = k3 = k4 = k5 = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(20; 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) = 20! / (4! * 4! * 4! * 4! * 4!)\n\nNow, we can compute the factorials:\n\n20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000\n4! = 24\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\nC(20; 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000 / (24 * 24 * 24 * 24 * 24)\n\nDividing by 24^5, we get:\n\nC(20; 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) = 4,862,519,424\n\nTherefore, there are 4,862,519,424 different possible combinations of groups that can be formed."
