    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C12, A4, or D6, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, satisfies:\n\n1. n_p divides the order of G.\n2. n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nSince the order of G is 12, we have two prime factors: 2 and 3. We will analyze the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, we have p = 2 and the order of the Sylow 2-subgroup is 2^2 = 4. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 12/4 = 3, and n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Therefore, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nFor the Sylow 3-subgroups, we have p = 3 and the order of the Sylow 3-subgroup is 3^1 = 3. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 12/3 = 4, and n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Therefore, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the values of n_2 and n_3.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to P × Q. Since P has order 4 and Q has order 3, G is isomorphic to C4 × C3, which is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Let Q be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since Q is normal in G, G acts on Q by conjugation, which induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(Q). Since Q has order 3, Aut(Q) is isomorphic to C2. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of G with index 2, which must be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Let P be this Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, G is the semidirect product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to P ⋊ Q. Since P has order 4 and Q has order 3, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C4 ⋊ C3, V4 ⋊ C3, where V4 is the Klein four-group. However, C4 ⋊ C3 is isomorphic to C12, which we have already considered in Case 1. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to V4 ⋊ C3, which is isomorphic to A4.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and G must be isomorphic to D6.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C12, A4, or D6."
