    "message_2": "To find the volume of the liquid in the tank, we can use the formula for the volume of a cone: V = (1/3)πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the liquid's surface. Since the tank is an inverted cone, the radius and height of the liquid are proportional to the radius and height of the tank. We can set up a proportion:\n\n(liquid radius) / (liquid height) = (tank radius) / (tank height)\n(liquid radius) / 7 = 4 / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the liquid radius:\n\n(liquid radius) = (4 / 10) * 7\n(liquid radius) = 2.8\n\nNow that we have the liquid radius, we can find the volume of the liquid using the formula for the volume of a cone:\n\nV = (1/3)π(2.8)²(7)\nV ≈ (1/3)π(7.84)(7)\nV ≈ (1/3)π(54.88)\nV ≈ π(18.293)\nV ≈ 57.45 cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of the liquid in the tank is approximately 57.45 cubic meters, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
