    "message_1": "A company can produce two products: chairs and tables. The company has 650 kg of wood, 200 units of screws, and 150 hours of labor available to produce the products. A chair requires 15 kg of wood, 10 screws, and 2 hours of labor to produce. A table requires 40 kg of wood, 20 screws, and 5 hours of labor to produce. The selling price of a chair is $50 and the selling price of a table is $100. What is the maximum profit that the company can make by producing a combination of chairs and tables using Mixed-integer Programming?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are as follows:\n\nWood: 15x + 40y ≤ 650\nScrews: 10x + 20y ≤ 200\nLabor: 2x + 5y ≤ 150\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 100y\n\nWe can use Mixed-integer Programming to solve this problem. However, we can also solve it using graphical method.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1) 15x + 40y ≤ 650\ny ≤ (650 - 15x) / 40\n\n2) 10x + 20y ≤ 200\ny ≤ (200 - 10x) / 20\n\n3) 2x + 5y ≤ 150\ny ≤ (150 - 2x) / 5\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points of these inequalities:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\n(650 - 15x) / 40 = (200 - 10x) / 20\nx = 10\n\nIntersection of (1) and (3):\n(650 - 15x) / 40 = (150 - 2x) / 5\nx = 20\n\nIntersection of (2) and (3):\n(200 - 10x) / 20 = (150 - 2x) / 5\nx = 5\n\nNow, we have the intersection points (10, 5), (20, 0), and (5, 15).\n\nLet's calculate the profit for each of these points:\n\nProfit at (10, 5) = 50 * 10 + 100 * 5 = 500 + 500 = $1000\nProfit at (20, 0) = 50 * 20 + 100 * 0 = 1000 + 0 = $1000\nProfit at (5, 15) = 50 * 5 + 100 * 15 = 250 + 1500 = $1750\n\nThe maximum profit is $1750, which can be achieved by producing 5 chairs and 15 tables."
