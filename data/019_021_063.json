    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for each player, we can use the concept of Nash equilibrium, which occurs when each player chooses a strategy that maximizes their payoff given the other player's strategy.\n\nFor Player 1:\nIf Player 2 chooses A, Player 1 should choose X (3 > 2).\nIf Player 2 chooses B, Player 1 should choose X (4 > 1).\n\nSo, Player 1's optimal strategy is to choose X.\n\nFor Player 2:\nIf Player 1 chooses X, Player 2 should choose A (3 > 4).\nIf Player 1 chooses Y, Player 2 should choose A (2 > 1).\n\nSo, Player 2's optimal strategy is to choose A.\n\nThe resulting outcome in the game would be the Nash equilibrium where Player 1 chooses X and Player 2 chooses A. The payoff for each player in this scenario is:\n\nPlayer 1: 3 utility points\nPlayer 2: 3 utility points"
