    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 12, 15, and 20 can be found by first finding the prime factorization of each number and then taking the highest power of each prime factor.\n\nPrime factorization of 12: 2^2 * 3\nPrime factorization of 15: 3 * 5\nPrime factorization of 20: 2^2 * 5\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor:\n2^2, 3, and 5\n\nMultiply these prime factors together:\n2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60\n\nSo, the LCM of 12, 15, and 20 is 60."
