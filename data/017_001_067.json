    "message_2": "Let's consider the given information and proceed step by step.\n\n1. We have a group G of order 4.\n2. There is an element a in G such that the order of a is 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible subgroups of G.\n\nSince G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1, 2, and 4. We know that there are two trivial subgroups: the subgroup containing only the identity element e (order 1) and the group G itself (order 4).\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroups of order 2. Since the order of a is 4, the cyclic subgroup generated by a is of order 4, which is the entire group G, i.e., ⟨a⟩ = G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}. \n\nLet H be a subgroup of G with order 2. Then H must contain the identity element e and one other element, say b, such that b ≠ a, a^2, a^3. Since the order of H is 2, we have b^2 = e.\n\nNow, we know that every subgroup of index 2 is normal. The index of H in G is [G:H] = |G|/|H| = 4/2 = 2. Therefore, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nSince ⟨a⟩ = G and the order of a is 4, G is already a cyclic group of order 4. Thus, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nThe Klein four-group V4 has the following structure: V4 = {e, x, y, z} with x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = e and xy = z, yz = x, zx = y. \n\nWe already have e and a^2 in G, and we know that (a^2)^2 = a^4 = e. So, we can consider a^2 as one of the elements of V4, say x. Now, let's consider the element b, which is in the normal subgroup H. We have b^2 = e, so b can be considered as another element of V4, say y.\n\nNow, we need to find the third element z. Since G is a group, it must be closed under the group operation. Therefore, the product ab must be in G. We know that ab cannot be e, a, a^2, or b, as they are already in G. So, we can consider ab as the third element z.\n\nNow, we have the following relations:\n\n1. e = e (identity)\n2. x = a^2\n3. y = b\n4. z = ab\n\nWe can verify that these elements satisfy the relations of the Klein four-group V4:\n\n1. x^2 = (a^2)^2 = a^4 = e\n2. y^2 = b^2 = e\n3. z^2 = (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 (since H is normal, ab = ba^(-1), so (ab)^2 = a^2b^2) = x^2y^2 = e\n4. xy = a^2b = ba^2 = yx (since H is normal)\n5. yz = bz = a^2 = x\n6. zx = a^2b^2 = a^2 = x\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, depending on the structure of G and its elements."
