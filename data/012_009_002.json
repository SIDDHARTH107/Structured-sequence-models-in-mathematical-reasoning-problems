    "message_2": "To determine if it is possible to draw this graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In other words, the sum of the degree sequence should be an even number.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the degree sequence:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20\n\nSince the sum is an even number, it is possible to draw this graph.\n\nNow, let's find the number of edges in the graph. According to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. Therefore, we can calculate the number of edges as follows:\n\nNumber of edges = (Sum of degree sequence) / 2\nNumber of edges = 20 / 2\nNumber of edges = 10\n\nSo, it is possible to draw this graph, and it has 10 edges."
