    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2 in the interval [0, 3], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting f'(x) = 0:\n\n3x^2 - 8x + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(3x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 5/3.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 3]:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 4(0)^2 + 5(0) - 2 = -2\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) - 2 = 0\nf(5/3) = (5/3)^3 - 4(5/3)^2 + 5(5/3) - 2 â‰ˆ -0.1852\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 5(3) - 2 = 2\n\nThe global minimum of f(x) in the interval [0, 3] occurs at x = 5/3, with a value of approximately -0.1852."
