    "message_1": "In the Chicken Game, two drivers are speeding towards each other. The first driver to swerve loses the game, but if neither swerves, they both crash. The game can be represented by a payoff matrix:\n\n|          | Driver 2 Swerves | Driver 2 Doesn't Swerve |\n|----------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| Driver 1 Swerves | -2, -2           | 1, -1                      |\n| Driver 1 Doesn't Swerve | -1, 1           | -10, -10                   |\n\nSuppose you are Driver 1, and you believe that there is a 50% chance that Driver 2 will swerve. What strategy maximizes your expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "To find the strategy that maximizes your expected payoff, we need to calculate the expected payoff for each of your possible actions (swerving and not swerving) given the 50% chance that Driver 2 will swerve.\n\n1. If you (Driver 1) swerve:\n- There's a 50% chance Driver 2 swerves: payoff = -2\n- There's a 50% chance Driver 2 doesn't swerve: payoff = 1\nExpected payoff for swerving = 0.5 * (-2) + 0.5 * (1) = -0.5\n\n2. If you (Driver 1) don't swerve:\n- There's a 50% chance Driver 2 swerves: payoff = -1\n- There's a 50% chance Driver 2 doesn't swerve: payoff = -10\nExpected payoff for not swerving = 0.5 * (-1) + 0.5 * (-10) = -5.5\n\nComparing the expected payoffs, the strategy that maximizes your expected payoff is to swerve, as it has a higher expected payoff (-0.5) compared to not swerving (-5.5)."
