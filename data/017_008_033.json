    "message_2": "To determine if the given group G is isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4, we can analyze the properties of the group and compare them to the properties of the three groups.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8: A cyclic group of order 8 has one generator that can generate all other elements by repeated multiplication. If G is isomorphic to C8, there should be an element in G that generates all other elements.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8: The quaternion group has 8 elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} with the following properties:\n   i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1\n   If G is isomorphic to Q8, the multiplication table should satisfy these properties.\n\n3. Dihedral group D4: The dihedral group of order 8 has two generators, r and s, with the following properties:\n   r^4 = s^2 = 1\n   srs = r^(-1)\n   If G is isomorphic to D4, the multiplication table should satisfy these properties.\n\nNow let's analyze the given multiplication table:\n\n- The table has 8 elements, which is consistent with all three groups.\n- The table has the identity element 1, which is consistent with all three groups.\n- The table has inverses for all elements, which is consistent with all three groups.\n\nNow let's check the properties of each group:\n\n1. Cyclic group C8: There is no single element in G that generates all other elements by repeated multiplication. Thus, G is not isomorphic to C8.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8: The multiplication table satisfies the properties of the quaternion group:\n   i^2 = -1, j^2 = -1, k^2 = -1, ijk = -1 * k = -k\n   Therefore, G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\n3. Dihedral group D4: The multiplication table does not satisfy the properties of the dihedral group. There is no element of order 4, and there is no pair of elements that satisfy the relations of the dihedral group. Thus, G is not isomorphic to D4.\n\nIn conclusion, the given group G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8."
