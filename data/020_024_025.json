    "message_1": "A hardware store is trying to optimize the price of a popular product, a lawn mower. Based on market research, the store has estimated the weekly demand for the lawn mower at different price points as:\n\n- $300: 100 units\n- $350: 90 units\n- $400: 80 units\n- $450: 70 units\n- $500: 60 units\n\nAssuming the store's weekly cost is $20,000 regardless of the price, what is the optimal price for the lawn mower? (Hint: Use the concept of marginal cost and marginal revenue.)",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price for the lawn mower, we need to calculate the marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC) for each price point and find the price where MR = MC.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue (TR) for each price point:\n\n1. $300: TR = $300 * 100 = $30,000\n2. $350: TR = $350 * 90 = $31,500\n3. $400: TR = $400 * 80 = $32,000\n4. $450: TR = $450 * 70 = $31,500\n5. $500: TR = $500 * 60 = $30,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the marginal revenue (MR) for each price point. MR is the change in total revenue when the quantity sold increases by one unit:\n\n1. MR between $300 and $350: ($31,500 - $30,000) / (90 - 100) = $1,500 / -10 = -$150\n2. MR between $350 and $400: ($32,000 - $31,500) / (80 - 90) = $500 / -10 = -$50\n3. MR between $400 and $450: ($31,500 - $32,000) / (70 - 80) = -$500 / -10 = $50\n4. MR between $450 and $500: ($30,000 - $31,500) / (60 - 70) = -$1,500 / -10 = $150\n\nNext, let's calculate the marginal cost (MC). Since the store's weekly cost is $20,000 regardless of the price, the MC is the same for all price points:\n\nMC = $20,000 / 100 = $200 (assuming the cost is spread evenly across all 100 units)\n\nNow, we need to find the price point where MR = MC. Based on our calculations, the MR is closest to the MC at the price point of $400:\n\nMR = -$50\nMC = $200\n\nAlthough the MR and MC are not equal, the price of $400 is the closest we can get to the optimal price with the given data. Therefore, the optimal price for the lawn mower is $400."
