    "message_2": "To find the probability density function of the particle using Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nwhere k is the wave number and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = ψ(x) = Ae^(-α|x|). We will need to split the integral into two parts, one for x ≥ 0 and one for x < 0, due to the absolute value in the exponent.\n\nF(k) = A ∫[e^(-αx) * e^(-ikx)] dx + A ∫[e^(αx) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n       (from -∞ to 0)       (from 0 to ∞)\n\nNow, we can solve each integral separately:\n\nFor the first integral (x < 0):\n\n∫[e^(-αx) * e^(-ikx)] dx = ∫[e^((-α-ik)x)] dx = (1/(-α-ik)) * e^((-α-ik)x)\n       (from -∞ to 0)                                  (from -∞ to 0)\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\n(1/(-α-ik)) * [e^0 - lim (x->-∞) e^((-α-ik)x)] = (1/(-α-ik))\n\nFor the second integral (x ≥ 0):\n\n∫[e^(αx) * e^(-ikx)] dx = ∫[e^((α-ik)x)] dx = (1/(α-ik)) * e^((α-ik)x)\n       (from 0 to ∞)                                  (from 0 to ∞)\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\n(1/(α-ik)) * [lim (x->∞) e^((α-ik)x) - e^0] = -(1/(α-ik))\n\nNow, we can add the two results together:\n\nF(k) = A * [(1/(-α-ik)) - (1/(α-ik))]\n\nTo find the probability density function, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of F(k). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nf(x) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[F(k) * e^(ikx)] dk\n       (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nHowever, solving this inverse Fourier transform analytically is quite challenging and may not have a simple closed-form expression. In practice, one would typically use numerical methods to compute the inverse Fourier transform and obtain the probability density function."
