    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to draw a graph G with the given degree sequence. Here's a possible graph G:\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H with degrees 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\n1. Connect vertices A, B, C, and D to form a cycle (A-B-C-D-A). Now, the degree of each of these vertices is 2.\n\n2. Connect vertex E to vertices A and B. Now, the degree of vertex E is 2, and the degree of vertices A and B is 3.\n\n3. Connect vertex F to vertices C and D. Now, the degree of vertex F is 2, and the degree of vertices C and D is 3.\n\n4. Connect vertex G to vertex A. Now, the degree of vertex G is 1, and the degree of vertex A is 3.\n\n5. Connect vertex H to vertex C. Now, the degree of vertex H is 1, and the degree of vertex C is 3.\n\nThe graph G with the given degree sequence is as follows:\n\nA -- B\n|    | \nD -- C\n|    |\nG    H\n\nHere, vertices A, B, C, and D have a degree of 3, vertices E and F have a degree of 2, and vertices G and H have a degree of 1, which matches the given degree sequence."
