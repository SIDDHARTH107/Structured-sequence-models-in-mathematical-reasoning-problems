    "message_2": "In Intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered true only if there is a constructive proof for it. However, the concept of even and odd numbers is well-defined in classical logic, which is a stronger logic than Intuitionistic logic. \n\nAn even number is an integer that is divisible by 2, and an odd number is an integer that is not divisible by 2. In classical logic, every natural number is either even or odd, as there is no natural number that cannot be classified as one or the other.\n\nIn Intuitionistic logic, we still have the same definitions for even and odd numbers. However, the law of excluded middle (which states that for any proposition P, either P or its negation ~P is true) does not hold in Intuitionistic logic. This means that we cannot simply assert that a number is either even or odd without a constructive proof.\n\nHowever, for any given natural number n, we can constructively prove whether it is even or odd by checking its divisibility by 2. If n is divisible by 2, then it is even, and if it is not divisible by 2, then it is odd. This constructive proof works for all natural numbers.\n\nTherefore, there is no smallest natural number that cannot be proven to be either even or odd in Intuitionistic logic, as we can constructively prove the parity of every natural number."
