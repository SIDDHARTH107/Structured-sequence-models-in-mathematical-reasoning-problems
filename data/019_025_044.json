    "message_1": "A car traveled a distance of 360 km between two cities. If it took the driver 5 hours to travel the first 240 km, how long did it take to travel the remaining 120 km?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the average speed of the car during the first 240 km of the journey. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (240 km) by the time it took to travel that distance (5 hours):\n\nAverage speed = Distance / Time\nAverage speed = 240 km / 5 hours\nAverage speed = 48 km/h\n\nNow that we know the average speed of the car during the first part of the journey, we can use this information to find out how long it took to travel the remaining 120 km. We can do this by dividing the remaining distance (120 km) by the average speed (48 km/h):\n\nTime = Distance / Average speed\nTime = 120 km / 48 km/h\nTime = 2.5 hours\n\nSo, it took the driver 2.5 hours to travel the remaining 120 km."
