    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square with the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's consider the first row. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the numbers 1, 2, and 3, which is 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, let's consider the second row. Since no number can be repeated in any column, there are only 2 possible ways to arrange the numbers in the second row for each arrangement of the first row.\n\nFinally, for the third row, there is only 1 way to arrange the numbers, as they are determined by the arrangement of the first and second rows.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct ways to fill a 3x3 Latin square is:\n\n6 (ways for the first row) × 2 (ways for the second row) × 1 (way for the third row) = 12 distinct ways."
