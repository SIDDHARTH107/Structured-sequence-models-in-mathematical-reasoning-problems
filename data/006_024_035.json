    "message_1": "A traveler has a 20% chance of experiencing a delay on any given leg of their trip. If they have a 3-leg journey (i.e. with 2 connections), what is the probability they will experience a delay on at least one leg of their trip?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that the traveler will not experience a delay on any leg of their trip, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of experiencing a delay on at least one leg.\n\nThe probability of not experiencing a delay on a single leg is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (or 80%).\n\nFor a 3-leg journey, the probability of not experiencing a delay on all three legs is 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80 = 0.512 (or 51.2%).\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of experiencing a delay on at least one leg:\n\n1 - 0.512 = 0.488 (or 48.8%).\n\nSo, the probability that the traveler will experience a delay on at least one leg of their 3-leg journey is 48.8%."
