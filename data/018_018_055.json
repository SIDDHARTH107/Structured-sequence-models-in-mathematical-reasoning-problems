    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} - {7, 8} = {2, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince union and intersection are commutative, we have:\n\nB ∪ A = A ∪ B = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nB ∩ A = A ∩ B = {7, 8}\n\nSo, B Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} - {7, 8} = {2, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSince A Δ B = {2, 4, 5, 6} and B Δ A = {2, 4, 5, 6}, the symmetric difference is commutative."
