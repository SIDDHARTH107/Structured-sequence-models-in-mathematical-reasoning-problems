    "message_1": "Consider the Beauty Contest game where players must guess a number between 0 and 100 inclusive. The winner of the game will be the player whose guess is closest to 2/3 of the average guess provided by all players. If there are multiple guesses that are equidistant from this value, the player who guessed first will be declared the winner. \n\nSuppose there are 10 players participating in the game. What number should each player guess to maximize their chances of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. If all players choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average guess would be around 50. In this case, the target number would be 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\n2. However, if all players are rational and think one step ahead, they would expect others to choose numbers around 33.33. So, they should choose 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\n3. Continuing this line of thought, if all players think two steps ahead, they would expect others to choose numbers around 22.22. So, they should choose 2/3 * 22.22 = 14.81.\n\n4. This process can be repeated iteratively, and the guesses will converge towards 0. The formula for the nth iteration is:\n\n   Guess_n = (2/3)^n * 100\n\nHowever, since there are only 10 players, we can't assume that all players will think infinitely many steps ahead. We can assume that players will think a few steps ahead, but not too many. Let's say they think 3 steps ahead.\n\nIn this case, the optimal guess for each player would be:\n\n   Guess_3 = (2/3)^3 * 100 â‰ˆ 14.81\n\nSo, each player should guess around 14.81 to maximize their chances of winning the game, assuming they think 3 steps ahead. Note that the optimal guess depends on how many steps ahead players think, and there isn't a unique answer to this problem."
