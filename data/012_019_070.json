    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree of the graph, denoted by Δ(G). The maximum degree is the highest number of edges incident to any vertex in the graph. Since there are 8 vertices and 13 edges, the maximum degree cannot be more than 6 (as 7 would require at least 14 edges).\n\nNow, we will use Vizing's Theorem, which states that for any graph G, Δ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the exact structure of the graph, we can't be sure if the chromatic index is equal to the maximum degree or one more than the maximum degree. Therefore, we can conclude that the chromatic index of G is either Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1.\n\nSo, the chromatic index of G is either the maximum degree (which is at most 6) or one more than the maximum degree (which is at most 7). Without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact chromatic index, but it must be in the range of 6 to 7."
