    "message_1": "Suppose we have a LTI system described by the transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 4s + 5}$. Using the Fourier transform, determine the stability of the system. Specifically, find the frequency range that results in a stable system.",
    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the LTI system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function H(s). The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero. \n\nGiven the transfer function H(s) = 1 / (s^2 + 4s + 5), let's find the poles by solving the quadratic equation in the denominator:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 5 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4 * 1 * 5)) / 2 * 1\ns = (-4 ± √(16 - 20)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (16 - 20) is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\ns = (-4 ± j√4) / 2\ns = -2 ± j2\n\nNow, let's analyze the stability of the system. A system is stable if the real parts of all its poles are negative. In this case, the real parts of both poles are -2, which is negative. Therefore, the system is stable.\n\nSince the system is stable for all frequencies, there is no specific frequency range that results in a stable system. The system is stable for all frequencies."
