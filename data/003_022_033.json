    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 6²) = √(9 + 36) = √45 = 3√5\n|B| = √((-2)² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can do this by finding the cosine of the angle between them using the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nTo find the dot product (A · B) using the component form, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = (3 * -2) + (6 * 5) = -6 + 30 = 24\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = 24 / (3√5 * √29) = 24 / (3√145)\n\nSince we want to find the dot product using trigonometry, we can plug the values back into the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = (3√5) (√29) (24 / (3√145)) = 24\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors A and B using trigonometry is 24."
