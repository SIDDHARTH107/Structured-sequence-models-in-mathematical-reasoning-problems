If so, please provide the sequence of vertices in the cycle. If not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph G.\n\nWe can start at vertex 1 and follow the edges according to the adjacency matrix:\n\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 8 - 9 - 7 - 10\n\nNow, we can see that vertex 10 is connected to vertex 8, which is already in our sequence. To form a cycle, we need to connect vertex 10 back to vertex 1, but there is no edge between vertex 10 and vertex 1 in the adjacency matrix.\n\nTherefore, there is no Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph G."
