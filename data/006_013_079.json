    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a major earthquake occurring in a certain region over the next year is 0.04. What is the probability that at least one major earthquake will occur in the region over the next three years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. The complement of the event \"at least one major earthquake occurs in the next three years\" is \"no major earthquakes occur in the next three years.\"\n\nThe probability of no major earthquake occurring in a single year is 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nSince the events are independent, the probability of no major earthquakes occurring in three consecutive years is the product of the probabilities for each year:\n\nP(no major earthquakes in 3 years) = 0.96 * 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.884736.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one major earthquake occurring in the next three years by taking the complement of the probability we just calculated:\n\nP(at least one major earthquake in 3 years) = 1 - P(no major earthquakes in 3 years) = 1 - 0.884736 = 0.115264.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one major earthquake will occur in the region over the next three years is approximately 0.115 or 11.53%."
