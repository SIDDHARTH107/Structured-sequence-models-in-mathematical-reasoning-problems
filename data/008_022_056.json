    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n|  2  3 -4 |  5 |\n|  1 -1 -1 | -1 |\n|  3  4 -5 |  4 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - (1/2) * R1\nR3 = R3 - (3/2) * R1\n\n|  2   3  -4 |  5  |\n|  0  -2   1 | -3  |\n|  0  -1/2  1 | -3/2|\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - (1/4) * R2\n\n|  2   3  -4 |  5  |\n|  0  -2   1 | -3  |\n|  0   0   3/4| -1/2|\n\nStep 3: Solve for z using back-substitution.\n\n(3/4)z = -1/2\nz = -2/3\n\nStep 4: Solve for y using back-substitution.\n\n-2y + z = -3\n-2y + (-2/3) = -3\ny = 1/3\n\nStep 5: Solve for x using back-substitution.\n\n2x + 3y - 4z = 5\n2x + 3(1/3) - 4(-2/3) = 5\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 1/3, and z = -2/3."
