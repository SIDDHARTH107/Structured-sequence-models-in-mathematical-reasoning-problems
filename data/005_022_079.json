    "message_2": "To find the median salary, we first need to list the salaries in ascending order. Since we know the average salary of the 10 employees is $50,000, we can find the sum of all their salaries:\n\nSum of salaries = Average salary × Number of employees = $50,000 × 10 = $500,000\n\nNow, we know that one of the employees has a salary of $350,000. So, the sum of the remaining 9 employees' salaries is:\n\nSum of 9 employees' salaries = Total sum - Highest salary = $500,000 - $350,000 = $150,000\n\nLet's assume that the remaining 9 employees have equal salaries. Then, each of their salaries would be:\n\nSalary of each of the 9 employees = Sum of 9 employees' salaries / 9 = $150,000 / 9 ≈ $16,667\n\nNow, we can list the salaries in ascending order:\n\n$16,667, $16,667, $16,667, $16,667, $16,667, $16,667, $16,667, $16,667, $16,667, $350,000\n\nSince there are 10 employees, the median salary will be the average of the 5th and 6th salaries in the ordered list:\n\nMedian salary = ($16,667 + $16,667) / 2 = $33,334 / 2 = $16,667\n\nSo, the median salary of these 10 employees is $16,667."
