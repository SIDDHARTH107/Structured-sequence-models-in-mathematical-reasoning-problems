    "message_2": "a) The diffusion equation for this problem, also known as the one-dimensional heat equation, is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity. The thermal diffusivity can be calculated as:\n\nα = k/(ρc)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity (400 W/mK), ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat capacity. Since we need to assume a value for the specific heat capacity, let's assume c = 400 J/kgK (a reasonable value for metals). We also need the density of the metal, so let's assume ρ = 8000 kg/m³ (similar to the density of steel).\n\nNow we can calculate the thermal diffusivity:\n\nα = 400/(8000*400) = 1.25 x 10^(-4) m²/s\n\nb) To solve the heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. The solution can be expressed as a Fourier series:\n\nT(x,t) = 20 + Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L) * exp(-α(nπ/L)²t)]\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (0.2 m), and B_n are the Fourier coefficients, which can be determined using the initial condition:\n\nB_n = (2/L) ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nwhere f(x) is the initial temperature distribution, which is 70°C (90 - 20) for 0 < x < L and 0 otherwise. The integral can be solved analytically, and we get:\n\nB_n = (140/(nπ)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow we can plug this back into the Fourier series and evaluate it at t = 30 seconds:\n\nT(x,30) = 20 + Σ [(140/(nπ)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(nπx/0.2) * exp(-1.25 x 10^(-4) * (nπ/0.2)² * 30)]\n\nc) The rate of heat transfer through the rod can be calculated using Fourier's law:\n\nq = -k * ∂T/∂x\n\nWe need to find the derivative of the temperature distribution with respect to x and evaluate it at the ends of the rod (x = 0 and x = L). The derivative of the Fourier series is:\n\n∂T/∂x = Σ [-(nπ/L) * B_n * cos(nπx/L) * exp(-α(nπ/L)²t)]\n\nEvaluating this at x = 0 and x = L, we get:\n\nq(0,30) = -k * Σ [(nπ/0.2) * (140/(nπ)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * exp(-1.25 x 10^(-4) * (nπ/0.2)² * 30)]\n\nSince the ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature, the heat transfer rate should be the same at both ends. We can simplify the expression and calculate the heat transfer rate numerically. Note that the series converges quickly, so we can truncate it after a few terms to get a good approximation."
