Find the number of rational curves of degree $d=6$ in $X$ that can be mapped to rational curves of degree $d=6$ in $Y$ via an appropriate toric fibration.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of mirror symmetry and the genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants. Mirror symmetry relates the complex geometry of a Calabi-Yau manifold $X$ to the symplectic geometry of its mirror manifold $Y$. In this case, we are given the Hodge numbers for both $X$ and $Y$.\n\nThe genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants count the number of rational curves of a given degree in a Calabi-Yau manifold. According to mirror symmetry, the Gromov-Witten invariants of $X$ are related to the variation of Hodge structures on $Y$. Specifically, the Gromov-Witten invariants of $X$ can be computed from the Yukawa couplings of $Y$.\n\nFor our problem, we want to find the number of rational curves of degree $d=6$ in $X$ that can be mapped to rational curves of degree $d=6$ in $Y$. This can be computed using the following formula:\n\n$$n_d = \\int_X \\left(\\frac{1}{d}\\right)^{h^{1,1}_X} \\left(\\frac{1}{d}\\right)^{h^{2,1}_X} \\prod_{i=1}^{h^{1,1}_Y} \\left(1 - \\frac{d}{d_i}\\right)^{-1} \\prod_{j=1}^{h^{2,1}_Y} \\left(1 - \\frac{d}{d_j}\\right)^{-1},$$\n\nwhere $n_d$ is the number of rational curves of degree $d$ in $X$ that can be mapped to rational curves of degree $d$ in $Y$, and $d_i$ and $d_j$ are the degrees of the toric divisors in $Y$.\n\nIn our case, we have $h^{1,1}_X = h^{2,1}_X = 101$, $h^{1,1}_Y = 11$, and $h^{2,1}_Y = 89$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$n_6 = \\int_X \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{101} \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{101} \\prod_{i=1}^{11} \\left(1 - \\frac{6}{d_i}\\right)^{-1} \\prod_{j=1}^{89} \\left(1 - \\frac{6}{d_j}\\right)^{-1}.$$\n\nTo compute $n_6$, we need to know the degrees $d_i$ and $d_j$ of the toric divisors in $Y$. However, these values are not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact value of $n_6$ without additional information.\n\nIn general, the number of rational curves of degree $d$ in $X$ that can be mapped to rational curves of degree $d$ in $Y$ depends on the specific geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifolds and the toric fibration."
