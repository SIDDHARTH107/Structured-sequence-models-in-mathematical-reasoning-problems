    "message_1": "Suppose you and a friend are playing a game where each of you has two options: either choose \"heads\" or \"tails\". If both choose \"heads\", you win $50. If both choose \"tails\", you win $25. But if you choose different options, then nobody wins any money. Assume that your friend always chooses randomly. What is your optimal strategy for maximizing your expected winnings?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for maximizing your expected winnings, we need to calculate the expected value for each of your choices (heads or tails) given that your friend chooses randomly.\n\nLet's denote the probability of your friend choosing heads as P(H) and tails as P(T). Since your friend chooses randomly, P(H) = P(T) = 0.5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value for each of your choices:\n\n1. If you choose heads:\n- You win $50 if your friend also chooses heads: P(H) * $50 = 0.5 * $50 = $25.\n- You win $0 if your friend chooses tails: P(T) * $0 = 0.5 * $0 = $0.\nSo, the expected value for choosing heads is $25.\n\n2. If you choose tails:\n- You win $0 if your friend chooses heads: P(H) * $0 = 0.5 * $0 = $0.\n- You win $25 if your friend chooses tails: P(T) * $25 = 0.5 * $25 = $12.50.\nSo, the expected value for choosing tails is $12.50.\n\nComparing the expected values, choosing heads has a higher expected value ($25) than choosing tails ($12.50). Therefore, your optimal strategy for maximizing your expected winnings is to always choose heads."
