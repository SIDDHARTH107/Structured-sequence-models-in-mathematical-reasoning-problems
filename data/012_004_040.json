Use Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cable length needed to connect all five towns with a direct cable line using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges (cable connections) in the graph in increasing order of their weights (distances).\n2. Start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree, making sure that adding a new edge does not form a cycle.\n3. Repeat step 2 until we have connected all the towns.\n\nSorted edges in increasing order of their weights:\n1-3, 1-2, 1-4, 1-5, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 3-4, 3-5, 4-5 (with weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 respectively)\n\nNow, let's start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add edge 1-3 (weight 1).\n2. Add edge 1-2 (weight 2).\n3. Add edge 1-4 (weight 3).\n4. Add edge 1-5 (weight 4). At this point, all towns are connected, and adding any more edges would create a cycle.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree has the edges 1-3, 1-2, 1-4, and 1-5.\n\nMinimum cable length = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10."
