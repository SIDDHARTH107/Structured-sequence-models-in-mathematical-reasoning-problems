    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift applied to the function. In the given function f(x) = 2sin(3x + pi/4), we can see that the phase shift is determined by the term inside the sine function.\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to set the term inside the sine function equal to zero:\n\n3x + pi/4 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n3x = -pi/4\nx = (-pi/4) / 3\nx = -pi/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x + pi/4) is -pi/12."
