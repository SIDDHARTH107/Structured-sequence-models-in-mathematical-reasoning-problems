    "message_1": "A company wants to schedule the production of two products, A and B. The production time for product A is 3 hours and for product B is 5 hours. The company has 40 hours of production time available each week. The profit per unit of product A is $50 and for product B is $70. What is the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced each week to maximize the total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe production time constraint can be represented as:\n3x + 5y ≤ 40\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\nP = 50x + 70y\n\nTo find the optimal number of units of each product, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we need to find the intercepts of the constraint equation:\nIf x = 0, then y = 40/5 = 8.\nIf y = 0, then x = 40/3 ≈ 13.33.\n\nNow, we can plot the constraint equation with the intercepts (0, 8) and (13.33, 0). The feasible region is below the line since the production time should not exceed 40 hours.\n\nNext, we need to find the corner points of the feasible region, which are the points where the maximum profit can occur. In this case, the corner points are (0, 0), (0, 8), and (13.33, 0).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 70(0) = $0\nP(0, 8) = 50(0) + 70(8) = $560\nP(13.33, 0) = 50(13.33) + 70(0) ≈ $666.50\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 13 units of product A and 0 units of product B, with a total profit of approximately $666.50 per week. However, since it's not possible to produce a fraction of a unit, the company should produce 13 units of product A and use the remaining hour for product B, which will not significantly affect the total profit."
