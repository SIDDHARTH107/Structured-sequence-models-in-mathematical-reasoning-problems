Using Fourier analysis, compute the power of the input signal and the power of each of the output signal's frequency components.",
    "message_2": "To compute the power of the input signal and the power of each of the output signal's frequency components, we first need to express the signals in terms of their Fourier series representation.\n\nThe input signal x(t) is already a single cosine function:\nx(t) = 3cos(5πt)\n\nThe output signal y(t) is the sum of two cosine functions:\ny(t) = 2cos(5πt + π/3) + 4cos(10πt - π/6)\n\nNow, we can compute the power of the input signal and the power of each of the output signal's frequency components using Parseval's theorem. Parseval's theorem states that the power of a signal in the time domain is equal to the power of its Fourier series representation in the frequency domain.\n\nFor the input signal x(t), the power is given by:\nPx = (1/T) * ∫[x(t)]^2 dt, where T is the period of the signal.\n\nSince x(t) is a single cosine function, its period is T = 2/5. Therefore, the power of the input signal is:\nPx = (1/(2/5)) * ∫[3cos(5πt)]^2 dt from 0 to 2/5\nPx = (5/2) * ∫[9cos^2(5πt)] dt from 0 to 2/5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the identity cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2:\nPx = (5/2) * ∫[9(1 + cos(10πt))/2] dt from 0 to 2/5\nPx = (45/4) * ∫[1 + cos(10πt)] dt from 0 to 2/5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\nPx = (45/4) * [t + (1/(10π))sin(10πt)] from 0 to 2/5\nPx = (45/4) * [(2/5) + 0 - 0] = (45/4) * (2/5)\nPx = 9/2\n\nSo, the power of the input signal is 9/2.\n\nFor the output signal y(t), we have two frequency components. We can compute the power of each component separately.\n\nFor the first component, 2cos(5πt + π/3), the power is given by:\nP1 = (1/T1) * ∫[2cos(5πt + π/3)]^2 dt from 0 to 2/5, where T1 = 2/5\nP1 = (5/2) * ∫[4cos^2(5πt + π/3)] dt from 0 to 2/5\n\nUsing the identity cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2:\nP1 = (5/2) * ∫[4(1 + cos(10πt + 2π/3))/2] dt from 0 to 2/5\nP1 = 5 * ∫[1 + cos(10πt + 2π/3)] dt from 0 to 2/5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\nP1 = 5 * [t + (1/(10π))sin(10πt + 2π/3)] from 0 to 2/5\nP1 = 5 * [(2/5) + 0 - 0] = 5 * (2/5)\nP1 = 2\n\nSo, the power of the first frequency component is 2.\n\nFor the second component, 4cos(10πt - π/6), the power is given by:\nP2 = (1/T2) * ∫[4cos(10πt - π/6)]^2 dt from 0 to 1/5, where T2 = 1/5\nP2 = (5) * ∫[16cos^2(10πt - π/6)] dt from 0 to 1/5\n\nUsing the identity cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2:\nP2 = (5) * ∫[16(1 + cos(20πt - π/3))/2] dt from 0 to 1/5\nP2 = 40 * ∫[1 + cos(20πt - π/3)] dt from 0 to 1/5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\nP2 = 40 * [t + (1/(20π))sin(20πt - π/3)] from 0 to 1/5\nP2 = 40 * [(1/5) + 0 - 0] = 40 * (1/5)\nP2 = 8\n\nSo, the power of the second frequency component is 8.\n\nIn summary, the power of the input signal is 9/2, the power of the first frequency component of the output signal is 2, and the power of the second frequency component of the output signal is 8."
