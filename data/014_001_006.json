    "message_1": "Suppose you want to send a secret message to your friend using RSA encryption. The public key is (e=23, n=437) and the message you want to send is \"81\". What is the ciphertext you should send to your friend? Also, assume that both you and your friend are operating on the same block size.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"81\" using RSA encryption with the given public key (e=23, n=437), we need to perform the following calculation:\n\nciphertext = (plaintext^e) % n\n\nIn this case, the plaintext is the numerical representation of the message, which is 81. So, we have:\n\nciphertext = (81^23) % 437\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\nciphertext = 403\n\nSo, the ciphertext you should send to your friend is \"403\"."
