    "message_2": "To calculate the contour integral ∮C (z^2 + 2z - 1) dz using Cauchy's theorem, we first need to check if the function is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on the contour C. The function f(z) = z^2 + 2z - 1 is a polynomial, and polynomials are analytic everywhere in the complex plane.\n\nCauchy's theorem states that the contour integral of an analytic function over a closed curve is zero. Therefore, the contour integral ∮C (z^2 + 2z - 1) dz is equal to 0."
