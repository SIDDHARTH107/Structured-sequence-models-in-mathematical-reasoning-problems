    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nSince there are 10 data points, the median will be the average of the 5th and 6th data points:\n\nMedian = (2 + 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) to calculate the interquartile range (IQR).\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the overall median if the number of data points is even):\n\n0, 0, 1, 1, 2\n\nQ1 = 1 (the middle value)\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the overall median if the number of data points is even):\n\n2, 3, 4, 5\n\nQ3 = (3 + 4) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 3.5 - 1 = 2.5\n\nSo, the median is 2 and the interquartile range (IQR) is 2.5."
