    "message_2": "To determine the outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data set in ascending order: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30\n\n2. Find the median (Q2) of the data set: Since there are 10 values, the median is the average of the 5th and 6th values: (15 + 18) / 2 = 16.5\n\n3. Find the lower quartile (Q1): The lower quartile is the median of the lower half of the data set. In this case, the lower half is 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. Since there are 5 values, the lower quartile is the 3rd value: Q1 = 9\n\n4. Find the upper quartile (Q3): The upper quartile is the median of the upper half of the data set. In this case, the upper half is 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30. Since there are 5 values, the upper quartile is the 3rd value: Q3 = 24\n\n5. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 24 - 9 = 15\n\n6. Calculate the lower bound for outliers: Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 9 - 1.5 * 15 = -13.5\n\n7. Calculate the upper bound for outliers: Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 24 + 1.5 * 15 = 46.5\n\n8. Identify the outliers: Any value below the lower bound or above the upper bound is considered an outlier. In this case, there are no values below -13.5 or above 46.5.\n\nTherefore, there are no outliers in this data set using the interquartile range (IQR) method."
