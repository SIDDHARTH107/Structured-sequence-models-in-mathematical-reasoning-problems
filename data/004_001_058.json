    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 1 with respect to x, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nStep 1: Differentiate the first term, 2x^3.\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2. So, the derivative of 2x^3 is (2)(3)x^2 = 6x^2.\n\nStep 2: Differentiate the second term, -5x^2.\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x^2 is 2x. So, the derivative of -5x^2 is (-5)(2)x = -10x.\n\nStep 3: Differentiate the third term, 4x.\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x is 1. So, the derivative of 4x is (4)(1) = 4.\n\nStep 4: Differentiate the constant term, -1.\nThe derivative of a constant is 0. So, the derivative of -1 is 0.\n\nStep 5: Combine the derivatives of each term.\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 4\n\nThe final answer is f'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 4."
