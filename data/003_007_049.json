    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides respectively:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 50 meters, b = 65 meters, and c = 80 meters. We want to find the smallest angle, which will be opposite the shortest side (a). So, we want to find angle A.\n\nRearranging the Law of Cosines formula to solve for cos(A):\n\ncos(A) = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2bc)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c:\n\ncos(A) = (65^2 + 80^2 - 50^2) / (2 * 65 * 80)\ncos(A) = (4225 + 6400 - 2500) / (10400)\ncos(A) = (8125) / (10400)\ncos(A) ≈ 0.78125\n\nNow, we need to find the angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nA = arccos(0.78125)\nA ≈ 38.2 degrees\n\nSo, the measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 38.2 degrees, rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree."
