    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the algebraic curve defined by the equation y² = x³ + 2x² - 5x, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y² - x³ - 2x² + 5x. Then, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x² - 4x + 5\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, -2):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, -2) = -3(1)² - 4(1) + 5 = -3 - 4 + 5 = -2\n∂F/∂y(1, -2) = 2(-2) = -4\n\nFinally, we can write the Jacobian matrix of the algebraic curve at the point (1, -2) as:\n\nJ = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n      |  -2         -4  |"
