    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of a matrix. The method starts with an initial vector and iteratively multiplies it by the matrix. After each iteration, the resulting vector is normalized. The process is repeated until convergence or a specified number of iterations is reached.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method for the given matrix A and initial vector [1, 1] for 5 iterations.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[4, -1],\n [2, 3]]\n\nInitial vector v0:\n[1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\nv1 = A * v0\nv1 = [[4, -1], [2, 3]] * [1, 1] = [3, 5]\nNormalize v1: v1_norm = v1 / ||v1|| = [3/√(3^2 + 5^2), 5/√(3^2 + 5^2)] = [0.514, 0.858]\n\nIteration 2:\nv2 = A * v1_norm\nv2 = [[4, -1], [2, 3]] * [0.514, 0.858] = [1.372, 3.430]\nNormalize v2: v2_norm = v2 / ||v2|| = [1.372/√(1.372^2 + 3.430^2), 3.430/√(1.372^2 + 3.430^2)] = [0.366, 0.930]\n\nIteration 3:\nv3 = A * v2_norm\nv3 = [[4, -1], [2, 3]] * [0.366, 0.930] = [0.804, 3.196]\nNormalize v3: v3_norm = v3 / ||v3|| = [0.804/√(0.804^2 + 3.196^2), 3.196/√(0.804^2 + 3.196^2)] = [0.244, 0.970]\n\nIteration 4:\nv4 = A * v3_norm\nv4 = [[4, -1], [2, 3]] * [0.244, 0.970] = [0.438, 3.134]\nNormalize v4: v4_norm = v4 / ||v4|| = [0.438/√(0.438^2 + 3.134^2), 3.134/√(0.438^2 + 3.134^2)] = [0.139, 0.990]\n\nIteration 5:\nv5 = A * v4_norm\nv5 = [[4, -1], [2, 3]] * [0.139, 0.990] = [0.281, 3.118]\nNormalize v5: v5_norm = v5 / ||v5|| = [0.281/√(0.281^2 + 3.118^2), 3.118/√(0.281^2 + 3.118^2)] = [0.090, 0.996]\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the normalized eigenvector is approximately [0.090, 0.996].\n\nTo find the largest eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\nλ = (v5_norm^T * A * v5_norm) / (v5_norm^T * v5_norm)\n\nλ = ([0.090, 0.996] * [[4, -1], [2, 3]] * [0.090, 0.996]) / ([0.090, 0.996] * [0.090, 0.996])\n\nλ = (0.090 * 4 + 0.996 * 2, 0.090 * (-1) + 0.996 * 3) * [0.090, 0.996] / (0.090^2 + 0.996^2)\n\nλ = (0.360 + 1.992, -0.090 + 2.988) * [0.090, 0.996] / (0.0081 + 0.992016)\n\nλ = (2.352, 2.898) * [0.090, 0.996] / 1.000116\n\nλ = (0.21168 + 2.887408) / 1.000116\n\nλ ≈ 3.099\n\nThe largest eigenvalue is approximately 3.099, and the corresponding eigenvector is approximately [0.090, 0.996]."
