    "message_1": "A production unit produces two variants of a product. Variant A requires 4 hours of processing time and 6 hours of drying time, while variant B requires 3 hours of processing time and 8 hours of drying time. The production unit has 40 hours of processing time and 64 hours of drying time available per week. The profit from producing variant A is $300 per unit, while the profit from producing variant B is $400 per unit. What is the optimal schedule for producing each variant to maximize the total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of variant A produced and y be the number of units of variant B produced. We have the following constraints based on the available processing and drying times:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 40 (processing time constraint)\n6x + 8y ≤ 64 (drying time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nP = 300x + 400y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 40\ny ≤ (40 - 4x) / 3\n\n6x + 8y ≤ 64\ny ≤ (64 - 6x) / 8\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 8), (10, 0), and (4, 8).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n\nP(0, 0) = 300(0) + 400(0) = $0\nP(0, 8) = 300(0) + 400(8) = $3200\nP(10, 0) = 300(10) + 400(0) = $3000\nP(4, 8) = 300(4) + 400(8) = $4400\n\nThe maximum profit is $4400, which occurs when producing 4 units of variant A and 8 units of variant B. Therefore, the optimal schedule is to produce 4 units of variant A and 8 units of variant B to maximize the total profit."
