    "message_2": "To determine the number of simple graphs with 4 vertices, we need to consider the number of possible edges that can be formed between these vertices. For a graph with n vertices, there can be a maximum of n(n-1)/2 edges.\n\nIn this case, n = 4, so the maximum number of edges is 4(4-1)/2 = 6 edges.\n\nNow, we need to consider all possible combinations of these edges to form different graphs. Since each edge can either be present or not present in a graph, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of edges.\n\nHowever, this includes the case where there are no edges at all (an empty graph). Since we are looking for simple graphs, we need to subtract this case from the total number of combinations.\n\nSo, the number of different simple graphs with 4 vertices is 64 - 1 = 63."
