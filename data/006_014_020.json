    "message_2": "To find the probability of the system crashing at least twice in a two-week period, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of the system crashing less than two times (either not crashing at all or crashing only once) during the two-week period.\n\nThere are 14 days in a two-week period. \n\nFirst, let's find the probability of the system not crashing at all during the two-week period. The probability of not crashing on any given day is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98. Since the days are independent, the probability of not crashing for 14 days is (0.98)^14.\n\nNext, let's find the probability of the system crashing exactly once during the two-week period. This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere n is the number of trials (14 days), k is the number of successes (1 crash), p is the probability of success (0.02), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(14, 1) = 14 (14 ways to choose 1 day for the crash to occur)\n\nSo, the probability of exactly one crash in the two-week period is:\n\nP(X = 1) = 14 * (0.02)^1 * (0.98)^13\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 2 crashes) = 1 - P(0 crashes) - P(1 crash)\n\nP(at least 2 crashes) = 1 - (0.98)^14 - [14 * (0.02)^1 * (0.98)^13]\n\nCalculate the values:\n\nP(at least 2 crashes) ≈ 1 - 0.763 - 0.207 ≈ 0.03\n\nSo, the probability that the system will crash at least twice in a given two-week period is approximately 0.03 or 3%."
