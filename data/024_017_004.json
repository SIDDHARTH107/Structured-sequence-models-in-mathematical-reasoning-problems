A vector v0 = (1,0) is tangent to the curve at the point (1,0). Determine the parallel transport of v0 along C and find the resulting vector v1 when t = pi/2.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of v0 along the curve C, we need to maintain the tangential property of the vector while moving along the curve. We can do this by keeping the vector orthogonal to the curve's tangent vector at each point.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector of the curve C. We can do this by taking the derivative of x(t) and y(t) with respect to t:\n\ndx/dt = -sin(t)\ndy/dt = cos(t)\n\nSo, the tangent vector T(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t)).\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the transported vector v(t) remains orthogonal to the tangent vector T(t) at each point. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is 0, so we have:\n\nv(t) · T(t) = 0\n\nLet v(t) = (a(t), b(t)). Then, we have:\n\na(t)(-sin(t)) + b(t)(cos(t)) = 0\n\nWe also know that v(0) = v0 = (1, 0). So, a(0) = 1 and b(0) = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find a(t) and b(t) that satisfy the above equation and the initial conditions. Since the transported vector remains orthogonal to the tangent vector, the magnitude of the transported vector remains constant. Thus, we can write:\n\na(t) = cos(θ(t))\nb(t) = sin(θ(t))\n\nwhere θ(t) is the angle between the transported vector and the x-axis.\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the equation:\n\ncos(θ(t))(-sin(t)) + sin(θ(t))(cos(t)) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by cos(t):\n\n-cos(θ(t))tan(t) + sin(θ(t)) = 0\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition θ(0) = 0:\n\n-cos(0)tan(0) + sin(0) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied, so our expressions for a(t) and b(t) are correct.\n\nNow, we want to find the resulting vector v1 when t = pi/2:\n\na(pi/2) = cos(θ(pi/2))\nb(pi/2) = sin(θ(pi/2))\n\nTo find θ(pi/2), we can use the equation we derived earlier:\n\n-cos(θ(pi/2))tan(pi/2) + sin(θ(pi/2)) = 0\n\nSince tan(pi/2) is undefined, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n-cos(θ(pi/2)) + sin(θ(pi/2)) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when θ(pi/2) = pi/4. So, we have:\n\na(pi/2) = cos(pi/4) = √2/2\nb(pi/2) = sin(pi/4) = √2/2\n\nThus, the resulting vector v1 is (√2/2, √2/2)."
