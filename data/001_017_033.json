    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that log_a(b) + log_a(c) = log_a(bc). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog base 2 ((x+1)(x-1)) = 3\n\nNow, we can use the property that log_a(b) = c is equivalent to a^c = b. In this case, we have:\n\n2^3 = (x+1)(x-1)\n\n8 = x^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 9\n\nx = Â±3\n\nHowever, we must check if these solutions are valid. If we plug x = 3 back into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog base 2 (3+1) + log base 2 (3-1) = log base 2 (4) + log base 2 (2) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, x = 3 is a valid solution.\n\nIf we plug x = -3 back into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog base 2 (-3+1) + log base 2 (-3-1) = log base 2 (-2) + log base 2 (-4)\n\nSince we cannot take the logarithm of a negative number, x = -3 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is x = 3."
