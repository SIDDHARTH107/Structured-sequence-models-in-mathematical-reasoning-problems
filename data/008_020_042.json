    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination. First, let's write down the system of equations:\n\n1) 2x + 3y + 5z = -1\n2) x - 2y + 3z = 7\n\nWe can eliminate x by multiplying equation 2 by 2 and then subtracting it from equation 1:\n\n2*(x - 2y + 3z) = 2*7\n2x - 4y + 6z = 14\n\nNow subtract equation 2*2 from equation 1:\n\n(2x + 3y + 5z) - (2x - 4y + 6z) = -1 - 14\n7y - z = -15\n\nNow we have a new equation:\n\n3) 7y - z = -15\n\nSince we have only two equations and three unknowns (x, y, and z), we cannot find a unique solution. However, we can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's express z in terms of y:\n\nz = 7y + 15\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for z back into equation 2:\n\nx - 2y + 3(7y + 15) = 7\nx - 2y + 21y + 45 = 7\nx + 19y = -38\n\nNow we have expressed x in terms of y:\n\nx = -19y - 38\n\nSo the solution to this system of linear equations is given by the parametric equations:\n\nx = -19y - 38\nz = 7y + 15\n\nwhere y can be any real number."
