    "message_1": "In a cipher text, the letters Q, Z, and X each appeared 15 times. Assuming that each of these letters represents a unique letter in the plaintext, what are the most probable letters in plaintext that correspond to Q, Z, and X based on the frequency of occurrence of letters in English text?",
    "message_2": "Based on the frequency of occurrence of letters in English text, the most common letters are E, T, and A. Since Q, Z, and X each appeared 15 times in the cipher text and are assumed to represent unique letters in the plaintext, it is most probable that Q, Z, and X correspond to E, T, and A in the plaintext. However, without more information about the specific cipher used, it is impossible to determine the exact correspondence between these letters."
