    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly replacing the sides of an equilateral triangle with a zigzag pattern. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 2.\n\nTo find the length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after n iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial length of the starting triangle is 3 units. So, the formula becomes:\n\nLength = 3 * (2^n)\n\nBy plugging in the value of n (number of iterations), we can find the length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after n iterations."
