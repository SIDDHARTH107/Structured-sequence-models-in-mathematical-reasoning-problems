    "message_2": "To perform the ANOVA test, we will first calculate the means and variances for each method, and then calculate the F-statistic. Finally, we will compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table to determine if there is a significant difference in the average grades.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the means for each method\nMethod A mean (M_A) = (90+85+95+80+75)/5 = 85\nMethod B mean (M_B) = (92+88+78+82+86)/5 = 85.2\nMethod C mean (M_C) = (84+88+90+96+92+94)/6 = 90.6667\n\nStep 2: Calculate the overall mean (M)\nM = (sum of all grades) / (total number of grades) = (sum of all grades) / 16\n\nSum of all grades = 90+85+95+80+75+92+88+78+82+86+84+88+90+96+92+94 = 1317\nM = 1317 / 16 = 82.3125\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between (SSB)\nSSB = n_A*(M_A - M)^2 + n_B*(M_B - M)^2 + n_C*(M_C - M)^2\nn_A = 5, n_B = 5, n_C = 6\n\nSSB = 5*(85 - 82.3125)^2 + 5*(85.2 - 82.3125)^2 + 6*(90.6667 - 82.3125)^2 = 222.7375\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Sum of Squares Within (SSW)\nSSW = sum of squared differences between each grade and its method mean\n\nFor Method A: (90-85)^2 + (85-85)^2 + (95-85)^2 + (80-85)^2 + (75-85)^2 = 250\nFor Method B: (92-85.2)^2 + (88-85.2)^2 + (78-85.2)^2 + (82-85.2)^2 + (86-85.2)^2 = 188.8\nFor Method C: (84-90.6667)^2 + (88-90.6667)^2 + (90-90.6667)^2 + (96-90.6667)^2 + (92-90.6667)^2 + (94-90.6667)^2 = 154.6667\n\nSSW = 250 + 188.8 + 154.6667 = 593.4667\n\nStep 5: Calculate the F-statistic\nF = (SSB / (k - 1)) / (SSW / (N - k))\nk = number of methods = 3\nN = total number of grades = 16\n\nF = (222.7375 / (3 - 1)) / (593.4667 / (16 - 3)) = (222.7375 / 2) / (593.4667 / 13) = 3.8853\n\nStep 6: Compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table\nAt a 5% level of significance, the critical value for F with (k - 1) = 2 and (N - k) = 13 degrees of freedom is approximately 3.81.\n\nSince the calculated F-statistic (3.8853) is greater than the critical value (3.81), we reject the null hypothesis that the average grades of students taught in the three teaching methods are equal. There is a significant difference in the average grades of students taught using the three different teaching methods at a 5% level of significance."
