If yes, then demonstrate a continuous path between any two points of each set; if no, then explain why not.",
    "message_2": "First, let's analyze each set separately.\n\nSet A: A = {(x, y) ∈ R^2 : 3 ≤ x^2 + y^2 ≤ 4}\nThis set represents the region between two concentric circles with the same center at the origin (0, 0) and radii √3 and 2. \n\nSet B: B = {(x, y) ∈ R^2 : (x − 1)^2 + y^2 ≤ 1}\nThis set represents the region inside a circle with center at (1, 0) and radius 1.\n\nNow, let's determine if each set is path-connected.\n\nSet A:\nTo show that set A is path-connected, we need to find a continuous path between any two points in the set. Let's take two arbitrary points P1 and P2 in set A. Since both points lie within the region between the two concentric circles, we can simply draw a straight line between P1 and P2. This line segment is continuous and connects the two points, so set A is path-connected.\n\nSet B:\nSimilarly, for set B, we need to find a continuous path between any two points in the set. Let's take two arbitrary points P1 and P2 in set B. Since both points lie within the circle with center (1, 0) and radius 1, we can again draw a straight line between P1 and P2. This line segment is continuous and connects the two points, so set B is path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, both sets A and B are path-connected, as we can find continuous paths between any two points within each set."
