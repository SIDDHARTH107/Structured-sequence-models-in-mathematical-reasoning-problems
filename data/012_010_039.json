    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible set of vertices that still covers all the edges.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find a minimum vertex cover by selecting vertices 2, 4, and 6. This covers all the edges, and no smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges. Therefore, the minimum size of a vertex cover for the given graph is 3."
