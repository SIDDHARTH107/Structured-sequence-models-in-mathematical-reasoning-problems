    "message_2": "To show that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be written as a power of g.\n\nSince |G| = 11, which is a prime number, we know that the order of G is 11. Let's consider an arbitrary non-identity element g in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Since 11 is a prime number, the only divisors of 11 are 1 and 11.\n\nNow, we know that the identity element e has order 1, and the order of g must be a divisor of 11. Since g is a non-identity element, its order cannot be 1. Therefore, the order of g must be 11.\n\nRecall that the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e. Since the order of g is 11, we have g^11 = e. This means that the set {e, g, g^2, g^3, ..., g^10} contains 11 distinct elements, which are all elements of G.\n\nThus, every element of G can be written as a power of g, and G is cyclic."
