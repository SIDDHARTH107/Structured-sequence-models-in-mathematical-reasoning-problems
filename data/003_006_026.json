    "message_2": "Let's denote the side opposite the 34-degree angle as a and the side opposite the 83-degree angle as b. In this case, b = 8.2 cm. We are given the following information:\n\nAngle A = 34 degrees\nAngle B = 83 degrees\nSide b = 8.2 cm\n\nFirst, we need to find the third angle of the triangle. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can find Angle C as follows:\n\nAngle C = 180 - (Angle A + Angle B)\nAngle C = 180 - (34 + 83)\nAngle C = 180 - 117\nAngle C = 63 degrees\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the length of side a:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B)\n\na / sin(34) = 8.2 / sin(83)\n\na = (8.2 / sin(83)) * sin(34)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\na ≈ (8.2 / 0.9962) * 0.5592\na ≈ 8.231 * 0.5592\na ≈ 4.603\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 34-degree angle (side a) is approximately 4.603 cm."
