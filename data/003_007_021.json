    "message_2": "We are given a triangle with sides a = 14, b = 18, and c = 25. We want to find the angle C opposite the side of length 25. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the given side lengths:\n\ncos(C) = (14^2 + 18^2 - 25^2) / (2 * 14 * 18)\ncos(C) = (196 + 324 - 625) / (504)\ncos(C) = (-105) / (504)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C whose cosine is -105/504. We can use the inverse cosine function (also called arccos or cos^(-1)) to find the angle:\n\nC = arccos(-105/504)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nC ≈ 111.8°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side of length 25 is approximately 111.8 degrees."
