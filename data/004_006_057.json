    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 - 24x^2 + 36x + 40, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 16x^3 - 24x^2 + 36x + 40)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 48x^2 - 48x + 36\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points of the function.\n\n12x^3 - 48x^2 - 48x + 36 = 0\n\nTo make it easier to solve, we can divide the entire equation by 12:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation. This can be done using various methods such as factoring, synthetic division, or numerical methods. In this case, we can use factoring:\n\n(x^3 - 4x^2) - (4x - 3) = 0\nx^2(x - 4) - 1(4x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can use the factored form to find the roots:\n\nx^2(x - 4) = 4x - 3\n\nx^2 = (4x - 3) / (x - 4)\n\nWe can now solve for x:\n\nx = 0 (since x^2 = 0)\nx = 4 (since x - 4 = 0)\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) are x = 0 and x = 4."
