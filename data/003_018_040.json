    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = cos(2x) - sin(3x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, we have two terms, so we'll differentiate each term separately.\n\nFor the first term, cos(2x), the outer function is cos(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of cos(u) with respect to u is -sin(u), and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2. So, using the chain rule, the derivative of cos(2x) with respect to x is:\n\nd/dx[cos(2x)] = -sin(2x) * 2 = -2sin(2x)\n\nFor the second term, sin(3x), the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. The derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), and the derivative of 3x with respect to x is 3. So, using the chain rule, the derivative of sin(3x) with respect to x is:\n\nd/dx[sin(3x)] = cos(3x) * 3 = 3cos(3x)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of the entire function y:\n\ndy/dx = d/dx[cos(2x) - sin(3x)] = -2sin(2x) - 3cos(3x)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = -2sin(2(π/4)) - 3cos(3(π/4))\n= -2sin(π/2) - 3cos(3π/4)\n= -2(1) - 3(-√2/2) (since sin(π/2) = 1 and cos(3π/4) = -√2/2)\n= -2 + (3√2)/2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = cos(2x) - sin(3x) at x = π/4 is:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = -2 + (3√2)/2"
