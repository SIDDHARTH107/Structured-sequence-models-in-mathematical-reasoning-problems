    "message_1": "Suppose we want to test the quality of four different brands of tires on five different types of road surfaces. We want to choose a sample size of 12 tests. \n\nUsing orthogonality, how many different combinations of tire brands and road surfaces can we test in a way that ensures all possible pairs of tire brands are tested on every type of road surface at least once?",
    "message_2": "To ensure orthogonality, we need to make sure that all possible pairs of tire brands are tested on every type of road surface at least once. There are 4 tire brands, so there are C(4,2) = 6 possible pairs of tire brands. We have 5 road surfaces and 12 tests to perform.\n\nLet's assign variables to the number of tests for each road surface: A, B, C, D, and E. We want to find non-negative integer values for A, B, C, D, and E such that:\n\nA + B + C + D + E = 12\n\nWe also want to make sure that all 6 pairs of tire brands are tested on each road surface. To achieve this, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Test all 6 pairs on road surface A.\n2. Test 3 pairs on road surface B and the other 3 pairs on road surface C.\n3. Test 2 pairs on road surface D and the remaining 4 pairs on road surface E.\n\nThis way, we ensure that all 6 pairs are tested on each road surface at least once. Now, we need to find the values for A, B, C, D, and E that satisfy the equation and the testing conditions.\n\nA = 6 (testing all 6 pairs on road surface A)\nB = 3 (testing 3 pairs on road surface B)\nC = 3 (testing the other 3 pairs on road surface C)\nD = 2 (testing 2 pairs on road surface D)\nE = 4 (testing the remaining 4 pairs on road surface E)\n\nSo, A + B + C + D + E = 6 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 18, which is greater than the sample size of 12 tests. Therefore, it is not possible to test all possible pairs of tire brands on every type of road surface at least once using orthogonality with a sample size of 12 tests."
