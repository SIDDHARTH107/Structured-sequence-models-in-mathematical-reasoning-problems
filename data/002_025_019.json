    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, one of the equal sides measures 8 cm and the angle opposite to it is 40 degrees. Calculate the length of the third side, also equal to the other equal side.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the isosceles triangle as ABC, where AB = AC = 8 cm (the equal sides) and angle BAC = 40 degrees (the angle opposite to side BC).\n\nTo find the length of the third side (BC), we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C opposite to those sides respectively:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we want to find the length of side BC (c), and we know that AB = AC = a = b = 8 cm and angle BAC = A = 40 degrees.\n\nc² = 8² + 8² - 2 * 8 * 8 * cos(40°)\n\nc² = 64 + 64 - 128 * cos(40°)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of cos(40°). Using a calculator, we get:\n\ncos(40°) ≈ 0.766\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\nc² = 64 + 64 - 128 * 0.766\nc² = 128 - 98.048\nc² ≈ 29.952\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc ≈ √29.952\nc ≈ 5.47 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side (BC) is approximately 5.47 cm."
