    "message_1": "A trapezium has two parallel sides, one measuring 8 cm and the other measuring 14 cm. The height of the trapezium is 6 cm. What is the perimeter of this trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two non-parallel sides. Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side. This line will be the height of both right triangles, which is 6 cm.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles with heights of 6 cm. Let's call the base of the smaller right triangle x and the base of the larger right triangle y. Since the bases of these two triangles add up to the difference between the two parallel sides (14 - 8 = 6), we can say that x + y = 6.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the non-parallel sides a and b. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFor the smaller right triangle, we have:\na^2 = x^2 + 6^2\n\nFor the larger right triangle, we have:\nb^2 = y^2 + 6^2\n\nSince x + y = 6, we can solve for y in terms of x: y = 6 - x. Now we can substitute this expression for y in the second equation:\n\nb^2 = (6 - x)^2 + 6^2\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, a^2 and b^2:\n\n1) a^2 = x^2 + 6^2\n2) b^2 = (6 - x)^2 + 6^2\n\nWe can solve for a^2 and b^2:\n\n1) a^2 = x^2 + 36\n2) b^2 = (36 - 12x + x^2) + 36\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 8 + 14 + a + b\n\nSince we have the expressions for a^2 and b^2, we can find the square root of each to get the lengths of a and b:\n\na = √(x^2 + 36)\nb = √(36 - 12x + x^2 + 36)\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for a and b into the perimeter equation:\n\nPerimeter = 8 + 14 + √(x^2 + 36) + √(36 - 12x + x^2 + 36)\n\nPerimeter = 22 + √(x^2 + 36) + √(x^2 - 12x + 72)\n\nTo find the exact perimeter, we would need more information about the trapezium, such as the angles between the sides or the exact values of x and y. However, this equation gives us a general expression for the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x."
