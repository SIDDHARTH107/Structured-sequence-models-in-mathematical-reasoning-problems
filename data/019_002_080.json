Using predicate logic, write the statement “All odd prime numbers greater than 2 are of the form 6n+1 for some integer n.”\n\nThen, prove the statement using the rules of predicate logic.",
    "message_2": "Using predicate logic, the statement \"All odd prime numbers greater than 2 are of the form 6n+1 for some integer n\" can be written as:\n\n∀x [(P(x) ∧ Q(x) ∧ x > 2) → (∃n (x = 6n + 1))]\n\nNow, let's prove the statement using the rules of predicate logic.\n\nProof:\n\nLet x be an odd prime number greater than 2. Since x is odd, it can be written in the form 2k + 1 for some integer k. Now, we need to show that x can also be written in the form 6n + 1 for some integer n.\n\nConsider the division of k by 3. There are two possible cases:\n\n1. k is divisible by 3, i.e., k = 3m for some integer m.\nIn this case, x = 2k + 1 = 2(3m) + 1 = 6m + 1, which is of the form 6n + 1 with n = m.\n\n2. k is not divisible by 3, i.e., k = 3m ± 1 for some integer m.\nIn this case, x = 2k + 1 = 2(3m ± 1) + 1 = 6m ± 2 + 1 = 6m ± 3. However, this would mean that x is divisible by 3, which contradicts the fact that x is a prime number greater than 2.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is that x is of the form 6n + 1 for some integer n. This completes the proof."
