    "message_2": "To find the range of the function f, we need to find the set of all possible outputs of f(x) for each x in A. Let's find f(x) for each element in A:\n\n1. f(1): The positive divisors of 1 are {1}, but since 1 is not in B, f(1) = {} (the empty set).\n2. f(2): The positive divisors of 2 are {1, 2}. The only divisor in B is 2, so f(2) = {2}.\n3. f(3): The positive divisors of 3 are {1, 3}. The only divisor in B is 3, so f(3) = {3}.\n4. f(4): The positive divisors of 4 are {1, 2, 4}. The only divisor in B is 2, so f(4) = {2}.\n\nNow, we can find the range of the function f by listing all the unique outputs:\n\nRange(f) = { {}, {2}, {3} }"
