    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to find the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor $g$ for the given metric is:\n\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the metric tensor:\n\n$$\n\\det(g) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{vmatrix} = 1(0 - 1) = -1\n$$\n\nThe volume form is given by the square root of the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by the standard volume form in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which is $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. Therefore, the volume form for the given metric is:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{|\\det(g)|} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = \\sqrt{1} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nSo, the volume form of the given metric is $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$."
