    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of a function f(x) with period 2π is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nFor odd functions, a_n = 0, and we have:\n\nf(x) = Σ(b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients using the formula:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * x)) dx, where the integral is taken over one period.\n\nFor 0 ≤ x < π, f(x) = 1, so:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(sin(n * x)) dx from 0 to π\n\nFor π ≤ x < 2π, f(x) = -1, so:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(-sin(n * x)) dx from π to 2π\n\nNow, we evaluate the integrals:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(n * x) / n] from 0 to π + (1/π) * [cos(n * x) / n] from π to 2π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(n * π) / n + cos(0) / n] + (1/π) * [cos(2 * n * π) / n - cos(n * π) / n]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-(-1)^n / n + 1 / n] + (1/π) * [1 / n - (-1)^n / n]\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [1 / n - (-1)^n / n]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ((2/π) * [1 / n - (-1)^n / n] * sin(n * x))\n\nFor the first two harmonics, we have:\n\nf_1(x) = (2/π) * [1 - (-1)] * sin(x) = (4/π) * sin(x)\nf_2(x) = (2/π) * [1/2 - (-1)^2 / 2] * sin(2 * x) = 0\n\nThe graph of the function f(x) consists of a square wave oscillating between 1 and -1 with a period of 2π. The first harmonic, f_1(x), is a sine wave with an amplitude of 4/π and a period of 2π. The second harmonic, f_2(x), is zero since its coefficient is zero."
