Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph.\n\nWe can start at vertex 1 and try to visit each vertex exactly once:\n\n1 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 5 - 2 - 1\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, which is 1. Therefore, the graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and the cycle is:\n\n1 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 5 - 2 - 1"
