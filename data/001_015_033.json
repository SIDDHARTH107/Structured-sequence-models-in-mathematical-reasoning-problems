    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 2^x = 16, we need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^x = 2^4\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 2^x = 16 is x = 4."
