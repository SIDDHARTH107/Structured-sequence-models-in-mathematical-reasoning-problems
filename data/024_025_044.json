    "message_2": "To find the second and third Chern classes of X, we can use the Chern-Weil theory and the Chern classes' properties.\n\nRecall that for a complex manifold X of dimension n, the total Chern class is given by:\n\nc(X) = 1 + c_1(X) + c_2(X) + ... + c_n(X)\n\nwhere c_i(X) are the Chern classes of X. In our case, n = 3, and we are given that c_1(X) = 4 times the generator of H^2(X,Z). \n\nNow, let's use the Whitney sum formula for the total Chern class:\n\nc(X) = c(TX) = c(TX^1) * c(TX^2) * c(TX^3)\n\nwhere TX is the tangent bundle of X, and TX^i are the tangent bundles of the submanifolds of X. Since X is a complex manifold, each TX^i has complex dimension 1, and their Chern classes are given by:\n\nc(TX^i) = 1 + c_1(TX^i)\n\nNow, let's use the fact that the first Chern class is additive:\n\nc_1(X) = c_1(TX^1) + c_1(TX^2) + c_1(TX^3)\n\nWe are given that c_1(X) = 4 times the generator of H^2(X,Z), so:\n\n4 times the generator of H^2(X,Z) = c_1(TX^1) + c_1(TX^2) + c_1(TX^3)\n\nNow, let's find the second Chern class, c_2(X). We can use the relation:\n\nc_2(X) = (1/2) * (c_1(X)^2 - 2 * c_1(TX^1) * c_1(TX^2) - 2 * c_1(TX^1) * c_1(TX^3) - 2 * c_1(TX^2) * c_1(TX^3))\n\nPlugging in the given value for c_1(X), we get:\n\nc_2(X) = (1/2) * (16 times the generator of H^2(X,Z)^2 - 2 * c_1(TX^1) * c_1(TX^2) - 2 * c_1(TX^1) * c_1(TX^3) - 2 * c_1(TX^2) * c_1(TX^3))\n\nNow, let's find the third Chern class, c_3(X). Since X is a complex manifold of dimension 3, we can use the relation:\n\nc_3(X) = c_1(X) * c_2(X) - c_1(TX^1) * c_1(TX^2) * c_1(TX^3)\n\nPlugging in the given value for c_1(X) and the expression for c_2(X), we get:\n\nc_3(X) = 4 times the generator of H^2(X,Z) * (1/2) * (16 times the generator of H^2(X,Z)^2 - 2 * c_1(TX^1) * c_1(TX^2) - 2 * c_1(TX^1) * c_1(TX^3) - 2 * c_1(TX^2) * c_1(TX^3)) - c_1(TX^1) * c_1(TX^2) * c_1(TX^3)\n\nTo find the explicit values of c_2(X) and c_3(X), we would need more information about the manifold X and its submanifolds. However, the above expressions give the general form of the second and third Chern classes in terms of the given first Chern class and the Chern classes of the submanifolds."
