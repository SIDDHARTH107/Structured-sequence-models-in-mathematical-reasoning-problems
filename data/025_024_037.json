    "message_2": "Geometric invariant theory (GIT) is a mathematical framework that deals with the symmetries of algebraic varieties and their quotients. It is not a direct method for finding roots of a polynomial. Instead, we can use other techniques to find the roots of the given polynomial.\n\nThe polynomial is x^3 - 3x^2 - 16x + 48. To find the roots, we can first try to factor the polynomial.\n\nLet's use the Rational Root Theorem to find a possible rational root. The possible rational roots are the factors of 48 divided by the factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). These are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±16, ±24, and ±48.\n\nBy trying these possible rational roots, we find that x = 4 is a root, since (4)^3 - 3(4)^2 - 16(4) + 48 = 0.\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 - 3x^2 - 16x + 48) / (x - 4) = x^2 + x - 12\n\nNow, we have the factored polynomial:\n\n(x - 4)(x^2 + x - 12)\n\nTo find the remaining roots, we can solve the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 12 = 0. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4(1)(-12))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-1 ± √49) / 2\n\nThe two remaining roots are:\n\nx = (-1 + 7) / 2 = 3\nx = (-1 - 7) / 2 = -4\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial x^3 - 3x^2 - 16x + 48 are x = 4, x = 3, and x = -4."
