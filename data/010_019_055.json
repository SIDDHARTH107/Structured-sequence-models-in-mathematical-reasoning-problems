    "message_1": "Suppose we have a manifold M with Morse function f:M→ℝ such that the critical set is given by 𝑐𝑟(f)={p1,p2,p3}, where p1 is a maximum and p2 and p3 are minima. Further, suppose that the index of p1 is 3, and the indices of p2 and p3 are 1 and 2, respectively. If the characteristic polynomial of the Hessian of f at p1 is given by 𝜆(𝑡)=(𝑡−1)^2(𝑡−2), find the Morse homology of M.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology of M, we first need to determine the Morse complex. The Morse complex is given by the free abelian groups generated by the critical points of f, graded by their index. In this case, we have:\n\nC_0 = 0 (since there are no critical points of index 0)\nC_1 = ℤ⟨p2⟩ (since p2 has index 1)\nC_2 = ℤ⟨p3⟩ (since p3 has index 2)\nC_3 = ℤ⟨p1⟩ (since p1 has index 3)\n\nNow, we need to compute the boundary maps between these groups. The boundary maps are determined by counting the number of gradient flow lines between critical points of consecutive indices. In this case, we have:\n\n∂_0: C_0 → 0 (trivial map)\n∂_1: C_1 → C_0 (trivial map, since C_0 = 0)\n∂_2: C_2 → C_1 (trivial map, since there are no gradient flow lines between p3 and p2)\n∂_3: C_3 → C_2 (trivial map, since there are no gradient flow lines between p1 and p3)\n\nNow, we can compute the Morse homology groups as the homology of this Morse complex:\n\nH_0(M) = ker(∂_0) / im(∂_1) = 0 / 0 = ℤ\nH_1(M) = ker(∂_1) / im(∂_2) = ℤ⟨p2⟩ / 0 = ℤ⟨p2⟩\nH_2(M) = ker(∂_2) / im(∂_3) = ℤ⟨p3⟩ / 0 = ℤ⟨p3⟩\nH_3(M) = ker(∂_3) / im(∂_4) = ℤ⟨p1⟩ / 0 = ℤ⟨p1⟩\n\nSo, the Morse homology of M is given by:\n\nH_0(M) = ℤ\nH_1(M) = ℤ⟨p2⟩\nH_2(M) = ℤ⟨p3⟩\nH_3(M) = ℤ⟨p1⟩"
