    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let F(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)) where f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4 and f2(x, y) = xy - 1. The Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x   2y |\n          |  y    x |\n\nNow, we need to choose an initial guess for the solution (x0, y0). Let's choose (x0, y0) = (1, 1). The Newton's method iteration formula for a system of equations is given by:\n\n(x, y) = (x0, y0) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0)\n\nWe first compute F(x0, y0):\n\nF(1, 1) = (1^2 + 1^2 - 4, 1*1 - 1) = (-2, 0)\n\nNext, we compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix J(1, 1):\n\nJ(1, 1) = | 2  2 |\n          | 1  1 |\n\nThe determinant of J(1, 1) is det(J(1, 1)) = 2 - 2 = 0, which means that J(1, 1) is singular and cannot be inverted. In this case, Newton's method cannot be directly applied with the initial guess (1, 1). \n\nHowever, we can try a different initial guess. Let's choose (x0, y0) = (2, 0.5). Now, we compute F(x0, y0):\n\nF(2, 0.5) = (2^2 + 0.5^2 - 4, 2*0.5 - 1) = (0.25, 0)\n\nNext, we compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix J(2, 0.5):\n\nJ(2, 0.5) = | 4  1 |\n            | 0.5  2 |\n\nThe determinant of J(2, 0.5) is det(J(2, 0.5)) = 8 - 0.5 = 7.5, which is nonzero, so J(2, 0.5) can be inverted. The inverse of J(2, 0.5) is:\n\nJ(2, 0.5)^(-1) = (1/7.5) * | 2  -1  |\n                             | -0.5  4 |\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton's method iteration formula:\n\n(x, y) = (2, 0.5) - J(2, 0.5)^(-1) * F(2, 0.5)\n\n(x, y) = (2, 0.5) - (1/7.5) * | 2  -1  | * (0.25, 0)\n                             | -0.5  4 |\n\n(x, y) = (2, 0.5) - (1/7.5) * (0.5, 1)\n\n(x, y) = (2 - 0.5/7.5, 0.5 - 1/7.5) = (1.9333, 0.4667)\n\nThus, after one iteration of Newton's method with the initial guess (2, 0.5), we get the approximate solution (x, y) = (1.9333, 0.4667). You can perform more iterations to get a more accurate solution, but this should be a good approximation."
