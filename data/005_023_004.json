    "message_1": "Suppose a data set of the quality control measurements of beverages produced in a factory. The average pH of the beverages is 5.0 with a standard deviation of 0.1. However, one of the measurements in the data set is suspected to be an outlier. If the suspected measurement has a pH of 4.2, is it really an outlier? Use the 3-sigma rule to determine the answer.",
    "message_2": "The 3-sigma rule states that approximately 99.7% of the data points in a normal distribution lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. In this case, the mean (average) pH is 5.0 and the standard deviation is 0.1.\n\nTo determine if the suspected measurement of pH 4.2 is an outlier, we'll calculate the range within which 99.7% of the data points should lie using the 3-sigma rule.\n\nLower limit = Mean - 3 * Standard Deviation\nLower limit = 5.0 - 3 * 0.1\nLower limit = 5.0 - 0.3\nLower limit = 4.7\n\nUpper limit = Mean + 3 * Standard Deviation\nUpper limit = 5.0 + 3 * 0.1\nUpper limit = 5.0 + 0.3\nUpper limit = 5.3\n\nSo, 99.7% of the data points should lie within the pH range of 4.7 to 5.3.\n\nSince the suspected measurement has a pH of 4.2, which is outside this range (4.7 to 5.3), it can be considered an outlier according to the 3-sigma rule."
