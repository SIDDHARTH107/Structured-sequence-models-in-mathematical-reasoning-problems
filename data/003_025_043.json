    "message_2": "To determine the boat's speed and direction relative to the ground, we need to add the boat's velocity vector to the water's velocity vector.\n\nLet's break down the water's velocity vector into its components:\n- Eastward component: 15 * cos(60°) = 7.5 km/h\n- Southward component: 15 * sin(60°) = 12.99 km/h\n\nNow, let's consider the boat's velocity vector relative to the water:\n- Northward component: 30 km/h (since the boat is moving northwards)\n\nNow, we can find the boat's velocity vector relative to the ground by adding the water's velocity vector components to the boat's velocity vector components:\n- Eastward component: 7.5 km/h (since the boat is not moving eastward or westward relative to the water)\n- Northward component: 30 - 12.99 = 17.01 km/h (subtracting the southward component of the water's velocity vector)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the boat's velocity vector relative to the ground using the Pythagorean theorem:\nv = sqrt((7.5)^2 + (17.01)^2) = sqrt(56.25 + 289.34) = sqrt(345.59) ≈ 18.59 km/h\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(opposite/adjacent) = arctan(17.01/7.5) ≈ 66.25°\n\nSince the boat is moving in the first quadrant (north and east), the direction is:\n66.25° north of east\n\nSo, the boat's speed relative to the ground is approximately 18.59 km/h, and its direction is 66.25° north of east."
