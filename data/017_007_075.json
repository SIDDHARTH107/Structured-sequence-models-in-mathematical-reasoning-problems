    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C6 or D3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 6 is either cyclic or not.\n2. If a group of order 6 is cyclic, it is isomorphic to C6.\n3. If a group of order 6 is not cyclic, it is isomorphic to D3.\n\nFirst, we will check if G is cyclic. A group G is cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g. In other words, G = {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^(n-1)} where n is the order of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 6, we will check if there exists an element g in G such that G = {g^0, g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5}. If such an element exists, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C6.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 2. Let H be a subgroup of order 3 and K be a subgroup of order 2. Since the orders of H and K are prime, both H and K are cyclic. Let h be a generator of H and k be a generator of K.\n\nNow, consider the element hk in G. Since h and k are from different subgroups, the order of hk is the least common multiple of the orders of h and k, which is 6. Therefore, G has an element of order 6, and G is cyclic.\n\nSince G is cyclic, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6."
