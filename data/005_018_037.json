They followed 10 patients and recorded their survival times in weeks: 12, 27, 15, 23, 31, 10, 8, 20, 25, 18. Using survival analysis, calculate the following:\n\n1) The median survival time.\n2) The 75th percentile survival time.\n3) The probability of surviving past 20 weeks.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to arrange the survival times in ascending order:\n\n8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 31\n\n1) The median survival time is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. Since there are 10 data points, we will take the average of the 5th and 6th values:\n\nMedian = (18 + 20) / 2 = 19 weeks\n\n2) The 75th percentile survival time is the value at which 75% of the data is below it. In this case, since there are 10 data points, the 75th percentile will be between the 7th and 8th values. We can take the average of these two values:\n\n75th percentile = (23 + 25) / 2 = 24 weeks\n\n3) To calculate the probability of surviving past 20 weeks, we need to count the number of patients who survived past 20 weeks and divide it by the total number of patients:\n\nNumber of patients surviving past 20 weeks = 5 (23, 25, 27, 31)\nTotal number of patients = 10\n\nProbability of surviving past 20 weeks = 5 / 10 = 0.5 or 50%"
