    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. To produce one unit of A, it takes 3 hours on machine X and 4 hours on machine Y. To produce one unit of B, it takes 2 hours on machine X and 5 hours on machine Y. Machine X can work for at most 16 hours a day and machine Y can work for at most 21 hours a day. The profit for one unit of product A is $100 and for one unit of product B is $150.\n \nWhat is the maximum profit the factory can earn in a day if it produces only A, only B, or a combination of A and B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 16 (Machine X constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 21 (Machine Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 100x + 150y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y = 16 => y = (16 - 3x) / 2\n4x + 5y = 21 => y = (21 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 4.2), (5.333, 0), and (2, 3). We will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 100(0) + 150(0) = $0\nP(0, 4.2) = 100(0) + 150(4.2) = $630\nP(5.333, 0) = 100(5.333) + 150(0) = $533.30\nP(2, 3) = 100(2) + 150(3) = $650\n\nThe maximum profit the factory can earn in a day is $650 by producing 2 units of product A and 3 units of product B."
