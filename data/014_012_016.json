    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we first need to repeat the keyword to match the length of the message. In this case, the keyword becomes \"MATHM\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square (or tabula recta) to find the corresponding ciphertext for each letter in the message. The Vigenere square consists of 26 rows and columns, each representing the letters of the alphabet.\n\nFor each letter in the message, we find the intersection of the row corresponding to the keyword letter and the column corresponding to the message letter.\n\n1. H (message) and M (keyword): The intersection is Z.\n2. E (message) and A (keyword): The intersection is E (since A doesn't shift the letter).\n3. L (message) and T (keyword): The intersection is X.\n4. L (message) and H (keyword): The intersection is U.\n5. O (message) and M (keyword): The intersection is B.\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"ZEXUB\"."
