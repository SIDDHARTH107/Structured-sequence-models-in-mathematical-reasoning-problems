Round your answers to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative method used to solve systems of linear equations. The idea is to rearrange each equation in the system so that the ith equation is solved for the ith variable. Then, we use the previous iteration's values for the other variables to compute the new value for the ith variable. \n\nFirst, let's rearrange the given system of linear equations to solve for x, y, and z:\n\nx = (10 - 2y - 3z) / 1\ny = (5 - 2x - z) / 1\nz = (2 - 3x - 2y) / 1\n\nNow, let's use the initial approximation of x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0 to compute the new values for x, y, and z after the first iteration:\n\nx_new = (10 - 2(0) - 3(0)) / 1 = 10\ny_new = (5 - 2(0) - 0) / 1 = 5\nz_new = (2 - 3(0) - 2(0)) / 1 = 2\n\nSo, after the first iteration, the approximations for the unknowns x, y, and z are:\n\nx ≈ 10.00\ny ≈ 5.00\nz ≈ 2.00"
