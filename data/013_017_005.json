    "message_1": "Suppose there are two used car dealers, Alice and Bob, selling cars of the same make and model. Alice knows that her cars are in good condition 70% of the time, and in poor condition 30% of the time. Bob knows that his cars are in good condition 60% of the time, and in poor condition 40% of the time. A buyer is interested in purchasing a car from one of the dealers, but does not know the condition of the car. If the buyer decides to buy from Alice, what is the chance that the car will be in good condition? If the buyer decides to buy from Bob, what is the chance that the car will be in good condition?",
    "message_2": "If the buyer decides to buy from Alice, the chance that the car will be in good condition is 70%, since Alice knows that her cars are in good condition 70% of the time.\n\nIf the buyer decides to buy from Bob, the chance that the car will be in good condition is 60%, since Bob knows that his cars are in good condition 60% of the time."
