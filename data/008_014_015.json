    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the QR decomposition method, we first need to rewrite the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the column vector of constants (6, 20, 29).\n\nA = | 1  2  1 |      x = | x |      b = |  6  |\n    | 2  3  4 |          | y |          | 20  |\n    | 3  4  5 |          | z |          | 29  |\n\nNext, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we factor A into the product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition algorithm (such as Gram-Schmidt, Householder, or Givens rotations), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.2673  0.8729  0.4082 |\n    | -0.5345  0.2182 -0.8165 |\n    | -0.8018 -0.4364  0.4082 |\n\nR = | -3.7417 -5.3452 -6.9487 |\n    |  0      0.8729  1.7457 |\n    |  0      0      0.4082 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation Rx = Q^T * b for x. First, we compute Q^T * b:\n\nQ^T * b = | -1.3397 |\n          |  8.4375 |\n          |  0.8165 |\n\nNow, we solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^T * b using back substitution:\n\nR = | -3.7417 -5.3452 -6.9487 |      x = | x |      Q^T * b = | -1.3397 |\n    |  0      0.8729  1.7457 |          | y |                |  8.4375 |\n    |  0      0      0.4082 |          | z |                |  0.8165 |\n\nFrom the third row of R, we have 0.4082z = 0.8165, which gives z = 2.\n\nNext, from the second row of R, we have 0.8729y + 1.7457(2) = 8.4375, which gives y = 1.\n\nFinally, from the first row of R, we have -3.7417x - 5.3452(1) - 6.9487(2) = -1.3397, which gives x = 3.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 1, and z = 2."
