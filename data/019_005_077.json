    "message_1": "Sorry, but I cannot provide a precise numerical problem for the subject of Epistemic Logic as it is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with reasoning about knowledge and belief. It is not typically associated with numerical problems or calculations. Instead, it focuses on constructing logical systems to represent and reason about knowledge and beliefs. Can I assist you with anything else related to mathematics or logic?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Please feel free to ask any other mathematical or logical questions, and I'll be happy to help."
