    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal shape that is created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the number of cubes increases. \n\nIn the first iteration, there are 20 cubes (8 corner cubes and 12 edge cubes). In each subsequent iteration, the number of cubes is multiplied by 20, since each remaining cube is replaced by a smaller Menger sponge.\n\nSo, for the 4th iteration, the total number of cubes is:\n\n20^4 = 160,000 cubes"
