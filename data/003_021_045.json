    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors u and v, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors, u · v is the dot product of the vectors, and |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the vectors u and v:\n\nu · v = (3i + 4j) · (-i + 2j) = 3(-1) + 4(2) = -3 + 8 = 5\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v| = √((-1)^2 + 2^2) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the angle θ:\n\n5 = 5 * √5 * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 * √5:\n\n1 / √5 = cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 1 / √5:\n\nθ = arccos(1 / √5)\n\nθ ≈ 26.57°\n\nSo, the angle between the vectors u and v is approximately 26.57°."
