    "message_1": "In a factory, there are 24 machines that can cause an accident. On average, each machine causes an accident once in every 5 years. What is the probability that at least one accident will occur in the factory within the next year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring in the factory within the next year, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single machine not causing an accident in the next year is 4/5 (since it causes an accident once in every 5 years, and there are 4 years in which it doesn't cause an accident).\n\nSince there are 24 machines, the probability of no accidents occurring in the factory within the next year is (4/5)^24.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one accident occurring, we subtract the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - P(no accidents)\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - (4/5)^24\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nP(at least one accident) ≈ 1 - 0.01296\nP(at least one accident) ≈ 0.98704\n\nSo, the probability that at least one accident will occur in the factory within the next year is approximately 0.98704 or 98.704%."
