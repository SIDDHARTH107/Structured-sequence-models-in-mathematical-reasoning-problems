    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 4 cm has a temperature distribution given by \n\nT(x) = 10 sin(πx/4) - 5 cos(3πx/4) + 2\n\nwhere x is the distance measured from one end of the rod. \n\nFind the temperature at the center of the rod.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature at the center of the rod, we need to find the value of T(x) when x is half the length of the rod, which is 2 cm. So, we will substitute x = 2 in the given equation:\n\nT(2) = 10 sin(π(2)/4) - 5 cos(3π(2)/4) + 2\n\nT(2) = 10 sin(π/2) - 5 cos(3π/2) + 2\n\nNow, we know that sin(π/2) = 1 and cos(3π/2) = 0. Therefore,\n\nT(2) = 10(1) - 5(0) + 2\n\nT(2) = 10 + 2\n\nT(2) = 12\n\nSo, the temperature at the center of the rod is 12°C."
