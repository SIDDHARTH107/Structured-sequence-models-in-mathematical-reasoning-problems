    "message_2": "First, factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n3x^2 - 36\n= 3(x^2 - 12)\n\nDenominator:\n9x^3 + 27x^2 - 54x\n= 9x(x^2 + 3x - 6)\n\nNow, we can try to factor the expressions inside the parentheses further.\n\nNumerator:\nx^2 - 12\nThis is a difference of squares, so we can factor it as:\n(x + √12)(x - √12)\n\nDenominator:\nx^2 + 3x - 6\nTo factor this quadratic, we look for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to 3. Unfortunately, there are no such numbers, so this quadratic is irreducible.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the original expression with the factored forms:\n\n(3(x + √12)(x - √12)) / (9x(x^2 + 3x - 6))\n\nThere are no common factors in the numerator and denominator, so the expression is already in its simplest form:\n\n(3(x + √12)(x - √12)) / (9x(x^2 + 3x - 6))"
