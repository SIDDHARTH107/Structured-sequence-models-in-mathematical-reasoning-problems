    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the given area about the x-axis, we will use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the cross-sectional area of the solid along the axis of rotation.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the solid at a given x-value is the area of a circle with radius y = x^2. The area of this circle is A(x) = π(x^2)^2 = πx^4.\n\nNow we need to integrate the area function A(x) with respect to x from x = 1 to x = 2:\n\nV = ∫[1, 2] πx^4 dx\n\nTo integrate, we use the power rule for integration:\n\n∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C\n\nSo,\n\nV = π∫[1, 2] x^4 dx = π[(x^5)/5] | [1, 2]\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of integration:\n\nV = π[((2^5)/5) - ((1^5)/5)]\nV = π[(32/5) - (1/5)]\nV = π(31/5)\n\nThus, the volume of the solid formed by rotating the given area about the x-axis is (31π/5) cubic units."
