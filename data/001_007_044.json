    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x - 5 > 7x + 2, we'll first move all the terms with x to one side of the inequality and the constants to the other side.\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides:\n-5 > 5x + 2\n\nNow, subtract 2 from both sides:\n-7 > 5x\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 5:\n-7/5 > x\n\nSo, the solution set is x < -7/5. In interval notation, this is written as (-âˆž, -7/5)."
