    "message_1": "A grayscale image f(x,y) of size 512 x 512 pixels has its Fourier Transform computed to get F(u,v). If the pixel value of f(256,256) is 100, what would be the corresponding magnitude value in F(u,v) for the frequency (0,0)?",
    "message_2": "The (0,0) frequency component of the Fourier Transform F(u,v) represents the DC component or the average value of the image f(x,y). To find the magnitude of F(0,0), we need to compute the average value of the image.\n\nSince we only know the pixel value at f(256,256) = 100, we cannot compute the exact average value of the entire image. We would need more information about the pixel values of the image to accurately calculate the magnitude of F(0,0)."
