    "message_2": "To find the sine and cosine of a 30-degree angle in a right triangle with a hypotenuse length of 10, we can use the definitions of sine and cosine in terms of the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\nsine(30°) = opposite side / hypotenuse\ncosine(30°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\nIn a 30-60-90 right triangle, the ratio of the side lengths is 1:√3:2. Since the hypotenuse is 10, we can find the lengths of the other two sides by dividing the hypotenuse by 2.\n\nopposite side (shorter leg) = 10/2 = 5\nadjacent side (longer leg) = 5√3\n\nNow we can find the sine and cosine of the 30-degree angle:\n\nsine(30°) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 5 / 10 = 1/2\ncosine(30°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = (5√3) / 10 = √3/2\n\nSo, the sine of a 30-degree angle is 1/2, and the cosine is √3/2."
