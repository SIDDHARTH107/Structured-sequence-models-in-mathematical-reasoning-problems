    "message_2": "Let's denote the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E. We can analyze the possible combinations of these vertices to form triangular faces.\n\nA simplicial complex with 5 vertices and 8 edges must have at least one vertex connected to all other vertices. Without loss of generality, let's assume vertex A is connected to all other vertices (B, C, D, and E). This gives us 4 edges: AB, AC, AD, and AE.\n\nNow we have 4 remaining edges to distribute among the other vertices. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. Vertex B is connected to C, D, and E. This gives us 3 more edges: BC, BD, and BE. In this case, we have 4 triangular faces: ABC, ABD, ABE, and BCD.\n\n2. Vertex B is connected to C and D, and vertex C is connected to D and E. This gives us 4 more edges: BC, BD, CD, and CE. In this case, we have 5 triangular faces: ABC, ABD, ACD, ACE, and BCD.\n\n3. Vertex B is connected to C and D, and vertex C is connected to E. This gives us 3 more edges: BC, BD, and CE. In this case, we have 4 triangular faces: ABC, ABD, ACE, and BCD.\n\nThese are the possible configurations that satisfy the condition of having 5 vertices and 8 edges. Therefore, the simplicial complex can have either 4 or 5 triangular faces, depending on its specific configuration."
