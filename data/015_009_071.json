    "message_2": "To find the Lyapunov exponent for the given discrete dynamical system, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to $x_n$:\n\n$f(x_n) = 2x_n - x_n^2$\n\n$f'(x_n) = 2 - 2x_n$\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent using the formula:\n\n$λ = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln |f'(x_i)|$\n\nSince we have the initial condition $x_0 = 0.5$, we can start by finding $f'(x_0)$:\n\n$f'(0.5) = 2 - 2(0.5) = 1$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $x_n$ for larger values of $n$. We can do this by iterating the function:\n\n$x_1 = 2(0.5) - (0.5)^2 = 0.5$\n\n$x_2 = 2(0.5) - (0.5)^2 = 0.5$\n\nNotice that the sequence is not changing, and $x_n = 0.5$ for all $n$. This means that the Lyapunov exponent is:\n\n$λ = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln |1|$\n\nSince $\\ln |1| = 0$, the sum is always zero, and the Lyapunov exponent is:\n\n$λ = 0$\n\nThis means that the given discrete dynamical system is neutrally stable around the fixed point $x_n = 0.5$."
