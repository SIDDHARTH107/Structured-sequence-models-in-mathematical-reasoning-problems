    "message_2": "Let P(x) represent \"x is a prime number\" and G(x) represent \"x is greater than 2.\" The given statement can be written as:\n\nIf P(x), then G(x).\n\nWe are asked to solve for x. Since the statement is true for all prime numbers, we cannot find a specific value for x. However, we can find the smallest prime number that satisfies the statement.\n\nThe smallest prime number is 2. However, 2 is not greater than 2, so it does not satisfy the statement. The next smallest prime number is 3, which is greater than 2. Therefore, the smallest value of x that satisfies the statement is x = 3."
