    "message_2": "The scaling factor of the Barnsley fern self-similarity pattern can be found by multiplying the original stem segment length by the stem reduction factor and each of the branch reduction factors. \n\nOriginal stem segment length = 10 units\nStem reduction factor = 0.5\nBranch reduction factors = 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8\n\nScaling factor = Original stem segment length × Stem reduction factor × Branch reduction factor 1 × Branch reduction factor 2 × Branch reduction factor 3 × Branch reduction factor 4\n\nScaling factor = 10 × 0.5 × 0.7 × 0.6 × 0.7 × 0.8\n\nScaling factor = 10 × 0.5 × 0.7 × 0.6 × 0.7 × 0.8 = 1.1764\n\nThe scaling factor of the Barnsley fern self-similarity pattern is 1.1764."
