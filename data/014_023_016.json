    "message_1": "In the Rail fence cipher, a plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" is encrypted with a rail fence of depth 3. If we read the cipher text row by row from top to bottom, we get \"MTAIHSEMTC\". Find the original plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail fence cipher, we need to reverse the process of encryption. The ciphertext is \"MTAIHSEMTC\" and the rail fence depth is 3. First, we need to find the number of characters in each row.\n\nRow 1: M _ T _ A _ I\nRow 2: _ A _ H _ S _ E\nRow 3: _ _ T _ _ _ M _ T _ _\n\nRow 1 has 4 characters, Row 2 has 3 characters, and Row 3 has 3 characters.\n\nNow, we can assign the ciphertext characters to each row:\n\nRow 1: M T A I\nRow 2: A H S E\nRow 3: T M T\n\nNext, we need to read the plaintext message by following the zigzag pattern:\n\nM -> A -> T -> H -> E -> M -> A -> T -> I -> C -> S\n\nSo, the original plaintext message is \"MATHEMATICS\"."
