    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the complex function $f(z)$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then we have:\n\n$$f(z) = (x + iy)^3 + (1 + i)(x + iy)^2 - (2 - i)(x + iy) - 2i$$\n\nNow, let's expand and simplify the expression:\n\n$$f(z) = (x^3 + 3ix^2y - 3xy^2 - iy^3) + (1 + i)(x^2 + 2ixy - y^2) - (2x - 2iy - 2ix + 2y) - 2i$$\n\nSeparating the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\n$$u(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 + x^2 - y^2 - 2x + 2y$$\n$$v(x, y) = 3x^2y - y^3 + 2xy + 2x - 2y - 2$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $z$ that satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$$\n\nTaking the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6xy + 2x - 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -6x^2 + 6y - 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 6xy + 2y + 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 3x^2 - 3y^2 + 2x - 2$$\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$$3x^2 - 6xy + 2x - 2 = 3x^2 - 3y^2 + 2x - 2$$\n$$-6x^2 + 6y - 2 = -(6xy + 2y + 2)$$\n\nSimplifying the first equation, we get:\n\n$$6xy = 3y^2$$\n\nFrom this equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) $y = 0$: In this case, the equation becomes $0 = 0$, which means any value of $x$ will satisfy the equation. So, we have infinitely many solutions of the form $z = x$.\n\n2) $y \\neq 0$: In this case, we can divide both sides by $6y$ and get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{1}{2}y$$\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the second equation:\n\n$$-6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}y\\right)^2 + 6y - 2 = -(6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}y\\right)y + 2y + 2)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$-3y^2 + 6y - 2 = -3y^2 - 2y - 2$$\n\nAdding $3y^2$ to both sides and simplifying further, we get:\n\n$$8y = 0$$\n\nSince we assumed $y \\neq 0$, this case leads to a contradiction, and there are no solutions in this case.\n\nSo, the values of $z$ that satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations are of the form $z = x$, where $x$ is any real number."
