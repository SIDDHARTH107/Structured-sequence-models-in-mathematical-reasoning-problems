    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 6 employees and 5 projects, we want to find the number of ways to arrange 5 projects among 6 employees.\n\nThis can be represented as a permutation: P(6, 5), which is the number of ways to choose 5 items from a set of 6 items, where the order matters.\n\nThe formula for permutations is:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number).\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and r = 5, so we have:\n\nP(6, 5) = 6! / (6 - 5)!\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n1! = 1\n\nNow, divide 6! by 1!:\n\nP(6, 5) = 720 / 1 = 720\n\nSo, there are 720 ways for the company to assign the 5 projects to the 6 employees."
