    "message_2": "Calculating the Floer homology groups of the pair (X, Y) requires a background in symplectic geometry and topology. Floer homology is a mathematical tool used to study the topology of symplectic manifolds and Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\nIn this case, X is a torus, which is a symplectic manifold, and Y is a sphere with three holes drilled out, which can be considered as a Lagrangian submanifold. To compute the Floer homology groups, we need to consider the moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic curves (also known as J-holomorphic curves) with boundary on Y in the symplectic manifold X.\n\nHowever, the Floer homology groups for this specific pair (X, Y) are not well-known or easily computable. The calculation of Floer homology groups is a highly specialized area of mathematics, and it typically requires advanced techniques and knowledge in symplectic geometry, algebraic topology, and differential geometry.\n\nIn general, the Floer homology groups provide information about the topology of the symplectic manifold and its Lagrangian submanifolds, but for this specific pair (X, Y), a complete calculation is beyond the scope of a simple answer. It would require a deep understanding of the relevant mathematical concepts and potentially new techniques to compute the Floer homology groups for this particular case."
