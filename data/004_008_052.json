    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 3, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 3.\n\nThe given function is y = x^2 - 4x + 7.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2 - 4x + 7)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule and the linearity of the derivative, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 2x - 4\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = 3:\n\ndy/dx(3) = 2(3) - 4\ndy/dx(3) = 6 - 4\ndy/dx(3) = 2\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 3 is 2."
