    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable and exponent.\n\nThe given expression is: 3x² + 4x² - 2x + 5x - 7\n\nFirst, let's combine the x² terms:\n(3x² + 4x²) = 7x²\n\nNext, let's combine the x terms:\n(-2x + 5x) = 3x\n\nNow, let's rewrite the expression with the combined terms:\n7x² + 3x - 7\n\nThe simplified expression is 7x² + 3x - 7."
