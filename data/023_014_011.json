    "message_2": "To find the coefficients in the Fourier series expansion of the wave function ψ(x) = cos(3πx/L), we need to express the wave function as a sum of sines and cosines with different frequencies. The general form of a Fourier series is given by:\n\nψ(x) = (a_0/2) + Σ[a_n * cos(2πnx/L) + b_n * sin(2πnx/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken over all positive integers n.\n\nTo find the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (2/L) * ∫[ψ(x) dx] from 0 to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[ψ(x) * cos(2πnx/L) dx] from 0 to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[ψ(x) * sin(2πnx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nSince ψ(x) = cos(3πx/L), we can see that the wave function is already in the form of a cosine function with n = 3. Therefore, all other coefficients a_n (for n ≠ 3) and all coefficients b_n will be zero.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_0 and a_3:\n\na_0 = (2/L) * ∫[cos(3πx/L) dx] from 0 to L\na_0 = (2/L) * [(L/3π) * sin(3πx/L)] from 0 to L\na_0 = (2/3π) * [sin(3π) - sin(0)] = 0\n\na_3 = (2/L) * ∫[cos(3πx/L) * cos(2π3x/L) dx] from 0 to L\na_3 = (2/L) * ∫[cos(3πx/L) * cos(6πx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nUsing the product-to-sum formula for cosines, we get:\n\na_3 = (1/L) * ∫[cos(3πx/L - 6πx/L) + cos(3πx/L + 6πx/L) dx] from 0 to L\na_3 = (1/L) * ∫[cos(-3πx/L) + cos(9πx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nNow, integrate:\n\na_3 = (1/L) * [(L/-3π) * sin(-3πx/L) + (L/9π) * sin(9πx/L)] from 0 to L\na_3 = (-1/3π) * [sin(-3π) - sin(0)] + (1/9π) * [sin(9π) - sin(0)] = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series expansion of the wave function ψ(x) = cos(3πx/L) is:\n\nψ(x) = 0 + Σ[0 * cos(2πnx/L) + 0 * sin(2πnx/L)] + a_3 * cos(6πx/L)\n\nSince a_3 = 0, the Fourier series expansion is simply:\n\nψ(x) = cos(3πx/L)\n\nThis result makes sense because the wave function is already in the form of a cosine function with a single frequency, so no additional terms are needed in the Fourier series expansion."
