    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B, which is the symmetric difference of A and B. This means we take the elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. Since A and B have no elements in common, A △ B is simply the union of A and B:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow let's find A', which is the complement of A. This means we take all the elements that are not in A. Since we don't have a universal set defined, we can assume the universal set is the union of A and B, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Therefore, A' is:\n\nA' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow we can find (A △ B) ∩ A', which is the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B and the complement of A:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ A' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNext, let's find (A ∆ B)', which is the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {} (empty set, since the universal set is the union of A and B)\n\nFinally, let's find [(A ∆ B)']∆ A', which is the symmetric difference of the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B and the complement of A:\n\n[(A ∆ B)']∆ A' = {} ∆ {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nSo, (A △ B) ∩ A' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and [(A ∆ B)']∆ A' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}."
