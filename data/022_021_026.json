    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = (s+1)/(s^2+4s+5), we first need to rewrite F(s) as a sum of simpler functions whose inverse Laplace transforms are known.\n\nWe can do this by performing partial fraction decomposition on F(s). We rewrite F(s) as:\n\nF(s) = A/(s + 2 + i) + B/(s + 2 - i)\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined, and i is the imaginary unit (i^2 = -1).\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator of F(s), we get:\n\ns + 1 = A(s + 2 - i) + B(s + 2 + i)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by substituting suitable values for s:\n\n1. Let s = -2 + i:\n1 + i = A(2i)\nA = (1/2) - (1/2)i\n\n2. Let s = -2 - i:\n1 - i = B(-2i)\nB = (1/2) + (1/2)i\n\nNow that we have the values of A and B, we can rewrite F(s) as:\n\nF(s) = ((1/2) - (1/2)i)/(s + 2 + i) + ((1/2) + (1/2)i)/(s + 2 - i)\n\nNow we can find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) using the known inverse Laplace transforms of the simpler functions:\n\nf(t) = L^(-1){F(s)} = L^(-1){((1/2) - (1/2)i)/(s + 2 + i)} + L^(-1){((1/2) + (1/2)i)/(s + 2 - i)}\n\nWe know that the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s + a) is e^(-at), so we can use this to find the inverse Laplace transforms of the simpler functions:\n\nf(t) = ((1/2) - (1/2)i)e^((-2 - i)t) + ((1/2) + (1/2)i)e^((-2 + i)t)\n\nNow, we can simplify f(t) by combining the real and imaginary parts:\n\nf(t) = e^(-2t)[(1/2)(cos(t) + sin(t)) + (1/2)i(cos(t) - sin(t))]\n\nSo, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is:\n\nf(t) = e^(-2t)(cos(t) + sin(t))"
