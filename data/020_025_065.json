    "message_1": "A delivery company needs to make eight deliveries in a day. The company has three delivery trucks that can hold a maximum of four packages each. The optimal route for each truck must be found to minimize the total distance traveled. The distances (in miles) between the delivery locations are given in the table below:\n\n|           | Delivery 1 | Delivery 2 | Delivery 3 | Delivery 4 | Delivery 5 | Delivery 6 | Delivery 7 | Delivery 8 |\n|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Delivery 1 |     -      |     20     |     12     |     18     |     25     |      8     |     17     |     22     |\n| Delivery 2 |     20     |     -      |     15     |     22     |     27     |     14     |     23     |     28     |\n| Delivery 3 |     12     |     15     |     -      |     10     |     13     |      7     |     12     |     14     |\n| Delivery 4 |     18     |     22     |     10     |     -      |     12     |      9     |     14     |     17     |\n| Delivery 5 |     25     |     27     |     13     |     12     |     -      |     15     |     18     |     19     |\n| Delivery 6 |     8      |     14     |     7      |     9      |     15     |      -      |     11     |     14     |\n| Delivery 7 |     17     |     23     |     12     |     14     |     18     |     11     |     -      |     8      |\n| Delivery 8 |     22     |     28     |     14     |     17     |     19     |     14     |     8      |     -      |\n\nWhat is the optimal routing for each delivery truck and what is the total distance traveled by all the trucks combined?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal routing for each delivery truck, we can use a combination of the nearest neighbor algorithm and the capacity constraint of the trucks. We will start with the delivery location with the shortest distance to another location and continue to the nearest location until the truck is full or all deliveries are assigned.\n\n1. Start with Delivery 1, since it has the shortest distance (8 miles) to Delivery 6.\n   Truck 1: Delivery 1 -> Delivery 6 (8 miles)\n\n2. From Delivery 6, the nearest location is Delivery 3 (7 miles).\n   Truck 1: Delivery 1 -> Delivery 6 -> Delivery 3 (8 + 7 = 15 miles)\n\n3. From Delivery 3, the nearest location is Delivery 4 (10 miles).\n   Truck 1: Delivery 1 -> Delivery 6 -> Delivery 3 -> Delivery 4 (15 + 10 = 25 miles)\n   Truck 1 is now full.\n\n4. The next shortest distance is between Delivery 7 and Delivery 8 (8 miles). Start Truck 2 with this route.\n   Truck 2: Delivery 7 -> Delivery 8 (8 miles)\n\n5. From Delivery 8, the nearest unassigned location is Delivery 5 (19 miles).\n   Truck 2: Delivery 7 -> Delivery 8 -> Delivery 5 (8 + 19 = 27 miles)\n\n6. Truck 2 has one more space, but there are two unassigned locations left (Delivery 2 and Delivery 4). We need to start Truck 3 for the remaining deliveries.\n\n7. From Delivery 2, the nearest unassigned location is Delivery 4 (22 miles).\n   Truck 3: Delivery 2 -> Delivery 4 (22 miles)\n\nThe optimal routing for each delivery truck is:\n- Truck 1: Delivery 1 -> Delivery 6 -> Delivery 3 -> Delivery 4 (25 miles)\n- Truck 2: Delivery 7 -> Delivery 8 -> Delivery 5 (27 miles)\n- Truck 3: Delivery 2 -> Delivery 4 (22 miles)\n\nThe total distance traveled by all the trucks combined is 25 + 27 + 22 = 74 miles."
