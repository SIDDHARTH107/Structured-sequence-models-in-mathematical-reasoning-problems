Find the optimal control `u(t)` that minimizes the following cost functional:\n\n`J = ∫[0,T] (y(t)^2 + u(t)^2) dt`\n\nwhere `T` is the final time. Use the state and adjoint equations to solve for `u(t)` and minimize the cost functional. Additionally, specify the optimal value of `J`.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control u(t) that minimizes the cost functional J, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we need to define the Hamiltonian H for the given problem. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n\nH = L + λ'(t) * f\n\nwhere L is the Lagrangian, λ(t) is the adjoint variable, and f is the state equation. In our case, L = y(t)^2 + u(t)^2 and f = y''(t) + 4y(t) - u(t).\n\nNow, let's write the Hamiltonian:\n\nH = y(t)^2 + u(t)^2 + λ(t) * (y''(t) + 4y(t) - u(t))\n\nNext, we need to find the state and adjoint equations. The state equation is given by the original differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 4y(t) = u(t)\n\nThe adjoint equation is given by the negative derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to y(t):\n\n-∂H/∂y = -2y(t) - 4λ(t)\n\nNow, we differentiate the Hamiltonian with respect to u(t) and set it to zero to minimize the Hamiltonian:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u(t) - λ(t) = 0\n\nSolving for u(t), we get:\n\nu(t) = 1/2 * λ(t)\n\nNow, we have a system of three differential equations:\n\n1. y''(t) + 4y(t) = 1/2 * λ(t)\n2. λ'(t) = -2y(t) - 4λ(t)\n3. -∂H/∂y = -2y(t) - 4λ(t)\n\nWe need to solve this system of equations with appropriate boundary conditions to find the optimal control u(t) and the optimal value of J. The boundary conditions depend on the specific problem and are not given in this question. Once the boundary conditions are provided, the system of equations can be solved numerically or analytically to find the optimal control u(t) and the optimal value of J."
