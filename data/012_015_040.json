    "message_2": "To determine the maximum and minimum possible number of connected components in the graph G, we need to consider two cases:\n\n1. Minimum number of connected components:\nIn this case, we want to create a graph with the least number of connected components, which means that the graph should be connected. To achieve this, we can create a tree with 7 vertices. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. So, in this case, we would need 7-1=6 edges to create a connected graph. Since we have 9 edges, we can add the remaining 3 edges to the tree without creating any new connected components. Therefore, the minimum number of connected components is 1.\n\n2. Maximum number of connected components:\nIn this case, we want to create a graph with the maximum number of connected components. To achieve this, we can create isolated vertices (vertices with no edges connected to them) and small connected components. Since we have 9 edges, we can create 3 connected components with 3 edges each, forming 3 cycles. Each cycle will have 3 vertices, so we will have 3*3=9 vertices in total. However, we only have 7 vertices, so we can remove 2 vertices from one of the cycles, leaving us with 2 connected components with 3 vertices each and 1 connected component with 2 vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of connected components is 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum possible number of connected components in the graph G is 1, and the maximum possible number of connected components is 3."
