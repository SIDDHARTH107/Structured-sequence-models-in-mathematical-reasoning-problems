    "message_1": "Sorry, Deontic Logic does not typically deal with numerical problems or mathematical equations. Instead, it pertains to the logic of obligation, permission, and related concepts. A possible question related to Deontic Logic could be:\n\nWhat is the difference between an obligation and a permission, and how can they be represented using logical operators?",
    "message_2": "In Deontic Logic, the primary focus is on the concepts of obligation, permission, and prohibition. The difference between an obligation and a permission lies in the level of requirement or allowance associated with an action.\n\nObligation: An obligation is a duty or requirement to perform a specific action. In Deontic Logic, obligations are represented by the symbol \"O\" followed by the action in parentheses. For example, if there is an obligation to perform action A, it would be represented as O(A).\n\nPermission: A permission, on the other hand, is an allowance or authorization to perform an action, but it is not a requirement. Permissions are represented by the symbol \"P\" followed by the action in parentheses. For example, if there is a permission to perform action A, it would be represented as P(A).\n\nIn Deontic Logic, logical operators such as \"and\" (∧), \"or\" (∨), \"not\" (¬), and \"implies\" (→) can be used to connect and manipulate obligations and permissions. For instance, if there is an obligation to perform action A and an obligation to perform action B, it can be represented as O(A) ∧ O(B). Similarly, if performing action A implies permission to perform action B, it can be represented as A → P(B)."
