    "message_2": "To find the percentage of employees earning between $40,000 and $60,000, we can use the properties of the normal distribution and the z-score formula. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the data point, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores for $40,000 and $60,000.\n\nFor $40,000:\nz1 = ($40,000 - $50,000) / $10,000 = -1\n\nFor $60,000:\nz2 = ($60,000 - $50,000) / $10,000 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the area between these two z-scores using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in function for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe area between z1 = -1 and z2 = 1 is the difference between the CDF values at these points:\n\nArea = CDF(z2) - CDF(z1) = CDF(1) - CDF(-1)\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n\nCDF(1) ≈ 0.8413\nCDF(-1) ≈ 0.1587\n\nArea = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, approximately 68.26% of employees earn between $40,000 and $60,000."
