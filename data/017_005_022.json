    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G is either 1 or 27. \n\nCase 1: There is only one 3-Sylow subgroup of G.\nIn this case, let P be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is the only 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Since the order of P is 27, P is a group of order 3^3. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P is either isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 27 (C27), or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (C3 x C9), or the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3 (C3 x C3 x C3).\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C27, then G is cyclic, and we are done.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C3 x C9 or C3 x C3 x C3, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, as required.\n\nCase 2: There are 27 3-Sylow subgroups of G.\nIn this case, let P be any 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since there are 27 such subgroups, each of order 9, the intersection of any two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups must be trivial (i.e., contain only the identity element). Therefore, the total number of non-identity elements in all the 3-Sylow subgroups is 27 * (9 - 1) = 216. However, this is impossible, as G has only 27 elements.\n\nThus, we have a contradiction, and there cannot be 27 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Therefore, every group of order 27 must fall into Case 1, and is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
