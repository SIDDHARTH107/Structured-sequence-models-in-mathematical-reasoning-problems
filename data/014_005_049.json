    "message_2": "To calculate the private key in a digital signature scheme using elliptic curve cryptography, we need to find the scalar (private key) that, when multiplied with the generator point, results in the public key.\n\nGiven:\n\nPublic key (P) = (17, 43)\nGenerator point (G) = (5, 1)\nOrder of the elliptic curve (n) = 53\n\nWe need to find the private key (d) such that:\n\nP = d * G\n\nSince we are dealing with elliptic curve cryptography, we cannot directly divide P by G to find d. Instead, we need to use the double-and-add algorithm to find the scalar multiplication of G.\n\nThe double-and-add algorithm is an iterative process that involves doubling the point and adding it to itself. We will perform this process until we find the private key (d) that satisfies the equation P = d * G.\n\n1 * G = (5, 1)\n2 * G = G + G = (13, 49)\n3 * G = 2 * G + G = (35, 47)\n4 * G = 3 * G + G = (52, 6)\n5 * G = 4 * G + G = (17, 43)\n\nWe found that 5 * G = (17, 43), which is equal to the public key (P). Therefore, the private key (d) is 5."
