Since B contains only single elements and AxB contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty:\n\n(AxB) ∩ B = ∅\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of B and {2,3,4}:\n\nB ∩ {2,3,4} = {2,3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A x (B ∩ {2,3,4}):\n\nA x {2,3} = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two results:\n\n(AxB) ∩ B = ∅\nA x (B ∩ {2,3,4}) = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\nSince the two results are not equal, this shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
