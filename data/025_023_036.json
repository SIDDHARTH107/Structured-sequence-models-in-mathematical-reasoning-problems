    "message_2": "Let's denote the three-dimensional complex projective space as P^3(C). The intersection of two quadrics in P^3(C) is a complete intersection, and we can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to compute the dimensions of the intersection cohomology groups.\n\nLet X be the intersection of two quadrics in P^3(C). Then X is a smooth surface of degree 4, which is called a K3 surface. The cohomology groups of a K3 surface are given by:\n\nH^0(X, C) = C\nH^1(X, C) = 0\nH^2(X, C) = C^22\nH^3(X, C) = C\n\nThe intersection cohomology groups coincide with the usual cohomology groups for a smooth variety, so the dimensions of the intersection cohomology groups for the intersection of two quadrics in P^3(C) are:\n\nIH^0(X, C) = dim H^0(X, C) = 1\nIH^1(X, C) = dim H^1(X, C) = 0\nIH^2(X, C) = dim H^2(X, C) = 22\nIH^3(X, C) = dim H^3(X, C) = 1"
