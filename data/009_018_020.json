    "message_2": "To find the power series solution, we assume a solution of the form:\n\ny(x) = ∑(n=0 to ∞) a_n * x^n\n\nwhere a_n are the coefficients of the power series. We can find the first and second derivatives of y(x):\n\ny'(x) = ∑(n=1 to ∞) n * a_n * x^(n-1)\ny''(x) = ∑(n=2 to ∞) n * (n-1) * a_n * x^(n-2)\n\nNow we can substitute y(x) and y''(x) into the given differential equation:\n\n∑(n=2 to ∞) n * (n-1) * a_n * x^(n-2) + sin(∑(n=0 to ∞) a_n * x^n) = 0\n\nUsing the Taylor series expansion for sin(y), we have:\n\nsin(y) = ∑(n=0 to ∞) (-1)^n * y^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!\n\nSo, sin(y(x)) = ∑(n=0 to ∞) (-1)^n * (∑(n=0 to ∞) a_n * x^n)^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!\n\nNow we can equate the coefficients of like powers of x on both sides of the equation. Using the initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1, we have:\n\na_0 = 0\na_1 = 1\n\nTo find the next non-zero term, we can look at the x^2 term:\n\n2 * a_2 + sin(a_0) = 0\n2 * a_2 = 0\na_2 = 0\n\nNow, let's look at the x^3 term:\n\n6 * a_3 + (-1)^1 * a_1^3 / 3! = 0\n6 * a_3 - 1/6 = 0\na_3 = 1/36\n\nSo, the first three non-zero terms of the power series solution are:\n\ny(x) ≈ x + (1/36) * x^3\n\nTo determine the radius of convergence, we can use the ratio test:\n\nlim(n→∞) |a_(n+1) / a_n|\n\nHowever, since this is a nonlinear differential equation, it is difficult to determine a general formula for the coefficients a_n. In this case, the radius of convergence cannot be determined analytically. Numerical methods or further analysis would be required to find the radius of convergence."
