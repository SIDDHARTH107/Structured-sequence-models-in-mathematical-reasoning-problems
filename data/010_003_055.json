    "message_2": "Since A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X, we have A ∩ B = ∅. We want to show that there exist disjoint open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nFor each point a ∈ A, since {a} is a closed set (given that every singleton is a closed set in X), its complement X \\ {a} is an open set. Similarly, for each point b ∈ B, X \\ {b} is an open set.\n\nNow, consider the open set U_a = X \\ {a} for each a ∈ A. Since B is a closed set and disjoint from A, we have B ⊆ X \\ A = ⋃_{a ∈ A} U_a. By the definition of a closed set, B is the intersection of all open sets containing it. Therefore, there exists an open set U containing B such that U ⊆ ⋃_{a ∈ A} U_a.\n\nNext, consider the open set V_b = X \\ {b} for each b ∈ B. Since A is a closed set and disjoint from B, we have A ⊆ X \\ B = ⋃_{b ∈ B} V_b. Similarly, there exists an open set V containing A such that V ⊆ ⋃_{b ∈ B} V_b.\n\nNow, we have A ⊆ V and B ⊆ U. We claim that U and V are disjoint. Suppose, for contradiction, that U ∩ V ≠ ∅. Then there exists a point x ∈ U ∩ V. Since U ⊆ ⋃_{a ∈ A} U_a and V ⊆ ⋃_{b ∈ B} V_b, we have x ∈ U_a for some a ∈ A and x ∈ V_b for some b ∈ B. But U_a = X \\ {a} and V_b = X \\ {b}, so x cannot be in both {a} and {b} as A and B are disjoint. This contradiction implies that U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nThus, we have found disjoint open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ V and B ⊆ U, as required."
