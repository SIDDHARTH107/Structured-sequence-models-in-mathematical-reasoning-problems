    "message_1": "Consider a stock price that fluctuates around $100 per share. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $2 per share. If the annual interest rate is 5%, what is the value of a one-year European call option with a strike price of $110, assuming that the stock price follows a log-normal distribution with a volatility of 20% per annum? Use the Fourier transform and the Black-Scholes formula to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first adjust the stock price for dividends and then use the Black-Scholes formula to find the value of the European call option.\n\n1. Adjust the stock price for dividends:\n\nSince the company pays a quarterly dividend of $2 per share, the total annual dividend is $2 * 4 = $8. The ex-dividend stock price, S', can be calculated as:\n\nS' = S - D\nS' = $100 - $8\nS' = $92\n\n2. Calculate the Black-Scholes parameters:\n\na. Risk-free interest rate (r): 5% per annum or 0.05\nb. Strike price (K): $110\nc. Time to expiration (T): 1 year\nd. Volatility (σ): 20% per annum or 0.20\n\n3. Calculate the intermediate variables:\n\na. Calculate d1:\nd1 = (ln(S'/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\n\nb. Calculate d2:\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\n4. Calculate the value of the European call option using the Black-Scholes formula:\n\nCall option value (C) = S' * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nwhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate the option value:\n\na. Calculate d1:\nd1 = (ln(92/110) + (0.05 + (0.20^2)/2) * 1) / (0.20 * sqrt(1))\nd1 ≈ -0.1822\n\nb. Calculate d2:\nd2 = -0.1822 - 0.20 * sqrt(1)\nd2 ≈ -0.3822\n\nc. Calculate the call option value (C):\nC = 92 * N(-0.1822) - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 1) * N(-0.3822)\nC ≈ 92 * 0.4277 - 110 * 0.9512 * 0.3510\nC ≈ 39.34 - 35.65\nC ≈ $3.69\n\nTherefore, the value of the one-year European call option with a strike price of $110 is approximately $3.69."
