    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 1269 is divided by 17 using modular arithmetic, we can use the following formula:\n\nremainder = (dividend) mod (divisor)\n\nIn this case, the dividend is 1269 and the divisor is 17. So, we have:\n\nremainder = 1269 mod 17\n\nTo calculate this, we can divide 1269 by 17 and find the remainder:\n\n1269 รท 17 = 74 with a remainder of 11\n\nSo, the remainder when 1269 is divided by 17 is 11."
