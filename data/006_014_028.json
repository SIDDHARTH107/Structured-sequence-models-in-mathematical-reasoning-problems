    "message_1": "A certain type of technological system has a failure rate of 0.05 per hour. What is the probability that this system will have at least one failure in a period of 10 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of having at least one failure is the probability of having no failures in the 10-hour period.\n\nThe probability of not having a failure in a single hour is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor a 10-hour period, the probability of not having any failures is (0.95)^10.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least one failure by subtracting the probability of not having any failures from 1:\n\nProbability of at least one failure = 1 - (0.95)^10\n\nProbability of at least one failure ≈ 1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability that this system will have at least one failure in a period of 10 hours is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
