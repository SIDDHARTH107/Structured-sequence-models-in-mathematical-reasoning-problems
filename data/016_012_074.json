    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It is constructed through a series of iterations, with each iteration increasing the complexity of the curve.\n\nIn the first iteration, the initial line segment is replaced by a sequence of 9 smaller segments, each with a length of 1/3 units. The total length of the curve after the first iteration is 9 * (1/3) = 3 units.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the 9 smaller segments from the first iteration is replaced by another sequence of 9 even smaller segments, each with a length of 1/9 units. The total length of the curve after the second iteration is 9 * 9 * (1/9) = 9 units.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Peano curve after the second iteration is 9 units."
