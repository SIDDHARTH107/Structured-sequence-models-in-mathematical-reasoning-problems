    "message_2": "To ensure that at least 3 people shook hands with each other, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. We will distribute the handshakes among the people in such a way that we minimize the possibility of 3 people shaking hands with each other.\n\nLet's denote the people as A, B, C, D, E, and F. We can distribute the handshakes as follows:\n\n1. A shakes hands with B, C, D, and E.\n2. B shakes hands with C, D, and E.\n3. C shakes hands with D and E.\n4. D shakes hands with E.\n\nIn this distribution, we have minimized the possibility of 3 people shaking hands with each other. However, we can see that A, B, and C have all shaken hands with each other. The total number of handshakes in this distribution is:\n\nA: 4 handshakes\nB: 3 handshakes\nC: 2 handshakes\nD: 1 handshake\n\nTotal handshakes: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\n\nSo, the minimum number of handshakes that must occur among the 6 people to ensure that at least 3 people shook hands with each other is 10."
