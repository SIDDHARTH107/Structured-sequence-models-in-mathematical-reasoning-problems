    "message_2": "To find the steady-state (equilibrium) solutions of the Lorenz system, we set the derivatives equal to zero:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y-x) = 0\ndy/dt = x(ρ-z)-y = 0\ndz/dt = xy-βz = 0\n\nNow, we solve the system of equations for x, y, and z. \n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\ny = x\n\nSubstitute y = x into the third equation:\n\nx^2 - βz = 0\n\nNow, substitute y = x into the second equation:\n\nx(ρ-z) - x = 0\nx(ρ-z-1) = 0\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: x = 0\n\nFrom y = x, we also have y = 0. Then, from x^2 - βz = 0, we have z = 0. So, one equilibrium point is (0, 0, 0).\n\nCase 2: ρ-z-1 = 0\n\nFrom this equation, we have z = ρ-1. Substitute this into x^2 - βz = 0:\n\nx^2 - β(ρ-1) = 0\nx^2 = β(ρ-1)\n\nSince β > 0, x^2 > 0, and we have two solutions for x: x = ±√(β(ρ-1)). Since y = x, we have two more equilibrium points: (±√(β(ρ-1)), ±√(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1).\n\nNow, we determine the stability of these equilibrium points by linearizing the system around each point and analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix J is given by:\n\nJ = | -σ   σ   0 |\n      | ρ-z  -1  -x |\n      |  y   x   -β |\n\nFor the equilibrium point (0, 0, 0), the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ0 = | -10  10   0  |\n        |  28  -1   0  |\n        |  0    0  -8/3 |\n\nThe eigenvalues of J0 are found by solving the characteristic equation det(J0 - λI) = 0:\n\n(-10-λ)((-1-λ)(-8/3-λ)) - 10(28(-8/3-λ)) = 0\n\nThis equation has one positive real eigenvalue and a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues with positive real parts. Since there is at least one eigenvalue with a positive real part, the equilibrium point (0, 0, 0) is unstable.\n\nFor the equilibrium points (±√(β(ρ-1)), ±√(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1), the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ± = | -10  10   0  |\n         | ρ-(ρ-1)  -1  -√(β(ρ-1)) |\n         | ±√(β(ρ-1))  ±√(β(ρ-1))  -8/3 |\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nJ± = | -10  10   0  |\n         |  1   -1  -√(β(ρ-1)) |\n         | ±√(β(ρ-1))  ±√(β(ρ-1))  -8/3 |\n\nThe eigenvalues of J± are found by solving the characteristic equation det(J± - λI) = 0. This equation has one negative real eigenvalue and a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues with negative real parts. Since all eigenvalues have negative real parts, the equilibrium points (±√(β(ρ-1)), ±√(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1) are stable.\n\nIn conclusion, the Lorenz system has three equilibrium points: (0, 0, 0), which is unstable, and (±√(β(ρ-1)), ±√(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1), which are stable."
