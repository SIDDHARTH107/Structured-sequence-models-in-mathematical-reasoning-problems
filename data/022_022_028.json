    "message_2": "To compute the Fourier transform F(w) of the function f(t) = e^(-t) for t > 0, we use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(w) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, f(t) = e^(-t) and ω = 3. So, we have:\n\nF(3) = ∫[e^(-t) * e^(-j3t)] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(3) = ∫[e^(-t(1 + j3))] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, we can use integration by substitution. Let u = -t(1 + j3), so du = -(1 + j3) dt. Then, dt = (-1/(1 + j3)) du.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nF(3) = ∫[e^u * (-1/(1 + j3))] du, where the integral is taken from 0 to -∞ (due to the negative sign in the substitution).\n\nWe can take the constant factor out of the integral:\n\nF(3) = (-1/(1 + j3)) ∫[e^u] du, where the integral is taken from 0 to -∞.\n\nNow, we can integrate e^u with respect to u:\n\nF(3) = (-1/(1 + j3)) * [e^u] evaluated from 0 to -∞.\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nF(3) = (-1/(1 + j3)) * (e^(-∞) - e^0) = (-1/(1 + j3)) * (0 - 1) = 1/(1 + j3).\n\nNow, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nF(3) = [(1 - j3)/(1 + j3)] * [(1 - j3)/(1 - j3)] = (1 - j3)/(1 + 9) = (1 - j3)/10.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform F(w) at w = 3 is:\n\nF(3) = (1 - j3)/10."
