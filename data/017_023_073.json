    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 72 are there, and can you provide an example of one?",
    "message_2": "There are 9 non-abelian groups of order 72. One example of a non-abelian group of order 72 is the semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_8, denoted as Z_9 ⋊ Z_8.\n\nHere, Z_9 is the cyclic group of order 9 and Z_8 is the cyclic group of order 8. The semidirect product is a specific type of group product that combines the two groups in a way that preserves their individual structures while creating a non-abelian group."
