    "message_2": "To find the scaling factor between the original Koch island and the third iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nscaling factor = (area of third iteration) / (area of original Koch island)\n\nIn this case, the area of the original Koch island is 16 square units, and the area of the third iteration is 64 square units. So, the scaling factor is:\n\nscaling factor = 64 / 16 = 4\n\nTherefore, the scaling factor between the original Koch island and the third iteration is 4."
