    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on $x$ and the other depending on $t$. Let $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 9X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 9\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 9\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2T(t) = 0$\n\n$X''(x) + \\frac{k^2}{9}X(x) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$T(t) = A\\cos(kt) + B\\sin(kt)$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X(x) = C\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x) + D\\sin(\\frac{k}{3}x)$\n\nThus, the general solution for $u(x, t)$ is:\n\n$u(x, t) = (A\\cos(kt) + B\\sin(kt))(C\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x) + D\\sin(\\frac{k}{3}x))$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\n$u(x, 0) = e^{-x^2} = AC\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x)$\n\nSince $u(x, 0)$ is an even function, we can set $D = 0$. Now, we have:\n\n$u(x, t) = (A\\cos(kt) + B\\sin(kt))C\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x)$\n\nApplying the second initial condition:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 0 = -kAC\\sin(\\frac{k}{3}x)$\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we can set $B = 0$. Now, we have:\n\n$u(x, t) = AC\\cos(kt)\\cos(\\frac{k}{3}x)$\n\nTo find the value of $u(1, 2)$, we need to determine the values of $A$, $C$, and $k$. However, we cannot find an exact expression for $u(x, t)$ using the given initial conditions and the method of separation of variables. The problem requires using other methods, such as Fourier series or transforms, to find an exact expression for $u(x, t)$."
