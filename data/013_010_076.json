    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot competition between two firms producing a homogenous product. The market demand curve Q = 120 - p where p is the price and Q is the quantity. Both firms have constant marginal cost of $20.\n\nWhat will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm and the market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm and the market price in a Cournot competition, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the inverse demand function (price as a function of quantity)\n2. Calculate each firm's reaction function\n3. Solve for the Nash equilibrium\n4. Calculate the market price\n\nStep 1: Inverse demand function\nThe given demand function is Q = 120 - p. To find the inverse demand function, we need to express p in terms of Q:\np = 120 - Q\n\nStep 2: Calculate each firm's reaction function\nLet q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. Then, the total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2. \n\nFirm 1's revenue is R1 = p * q1 = (120 - Q) * q1 = (120 - (q1 + q2)) * q1\nFirm 2's revenue is R2 = p * q2 = (120 - Q) * q2 = (120 - (q1 + q2)) * q2\n\nBoth firms have a constant marginal cost of $20. Therefore, the total cost for each firm is C1 = 20 * q1 and C2 = 20 * q2.\n\nNow, we can calculate each firm's profit:\nProfit1 = R1 - C1 = (120 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 20 * q1\nProfit2 = R2 - C2 = (120 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 20 * q2\n\nEach firm maximizes its profit by choosing the optimal quantity. To find the optimal quantity, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to the firm's quantity and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit1)/dq1 = 120 - 2*q1 - q2 - 20 = 0\nd(Profit2)/dq2 = 120 - 2*q2 - q1 - 20 = 0\n\nThese are the reaction functions for firm 1 and firm 2.\n\nStep 3: Solve for the Nash equilibrium\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the reaction functions:\n\n120 - 2*q1 - q2 - 20 = 0\n120 - 2*q2 - q1 - 20 = 0\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n100 - 2*q1 - q2 = 0\n100 - 2*q2 - q1 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n\nq1 = 20\nq2 = 20\n\nStep 4: Calculate the market price\nNow that we have the equilibrium quantities for each firm, we can find the market price using the inverse demand function:\n\np = 120 - Q = 120 - (q1 + q2) = 120 - (20 + 20) = 80\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm is 20 units, and the market price is $80."
