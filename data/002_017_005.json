    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * s^2) / 2\n\nwhere s is the side length of the hexagon.\n\nIn this case, s = 8 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * 8^2) / 2\nArea = (3 * √3 * 64) / 2\nArea = (192 * √3) / 2\nArea = 96 * √3\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of √3 as 1.732.\n\nArea ≈ 96 * 1.732\nArea ≈ 166.272\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the area of the regular hexagon is approximately 166.3 square centimeters."
