    "message_2": "To solve Laplace's equation in two dimensions for the electrostatic potential of a circular metal disk, we can use polar coordinates (r, θ) and express the Laplace's equation as:\n\n∇²V(r, θ) = (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂V/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²V/∂θ² = 0\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions: V(R, θ) = 10 V for r = R = 0.2 m and V(r, θ) = 0 for r → ∞.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let V(r, θ) = R(r)Θ(θ). Then, the Laplace's equation becomes:\n\n(1/R) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² = 0\n\nSeparating the variables, we get:\n\nr² d²R/dr² + r dR/dr = -λ²R\nd²Θ/dθ² = -λ²Θ\n\nSolving the Θ equation, we get:\n\nΘ(θ) = A cos(λθ) + B sin(λθ)\n\nSince the potential is symmetric about the θ-axis, we can set B = 0. Thus,\n\nΘ(θ) = A cos(λθ)\n\nNow, solving the R equation, we get:\n\nR(r) = C₁J₀(λr) + C₂Y₀(λr)\n\nSince Y₀(λr) is singular at r = 0, we set C₂ = 0. Thus,\n\nR(r) = C₁J₀(λr)\n\nNow, the general solution for the potential is:\n\nV(r, θ) = Σ (A_n J₀(λ_n r) cos(λ_n θ))\n\nApplying the boundary condition V(R, θ) = 10 V, we get:\n\n10 = Σ (A_n J₀(λ_n R) cos(λ_n θ))\n\nSince the problem is symmetric about the θ-axis, we can use the orthogonality property of the cosine function to find the coefficients A_n:\n\nA_n = (10/R) ∫₀^R J₀(λ_n r) r dr\n\nTo find the λ_n values, we need to use the boundary condition V(r, θ) = 0 for r → ∞. This implies that the λ_n values are the zeros of the Bessel function J₀(x). Let λ_n R = x_n, where x_n are the zeros of J₀(x).\n\nFinally, the solution for the electrostatic potential is:\n\nV(r, θ) = Σ [(10/R) ∫₀^R J₀(λ_n r) r dr] J₀(λ_n r) cos(λ_n θ)\n\nThis series converges to the potential at any point (r, θ) in the region outside the circular metal disk."
