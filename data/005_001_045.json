    "message_1": "In a statistics class, a professor claims that the mean test score of the class is 75. To test this claim, a random sample of 25 students was chosen and their mean test score was found to be 72 with a standard deviation of 6. Is there enough evidence to reject the professor's claim at 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the professor's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean test score is 75, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean test score is not 75.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the t-score\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\nt = (72 - 75) / (6 / sqrt(25))\nt = (-3) / (6 / 5)\nt = -3 / 1.2\nt = -2.5\n\nStep 2: Determine the critical t-value\nWe are given a 5% level of significance, which means we have a 95% confidence interval. Since we are performing a two-tailed test, we will divide the level of significance by 2, resulting in a 2.5% level of significance on each tail.\n\nUsing a t-distribution table, we find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1) and a 2.5% level of significance in each tail. The critical t-value is approximately Â±2.064.\n\nStep 3: Compare the t-score to the critical t-value\nOur calculated t-score is -2.5, which is less than the critical t-value of -2.064.\n\nSince the t-score falls in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence at the 5% level of significance to reject the professor's claim that the mean test score of the class is 75."
