    "message_1": "In how many ways can you choose two different flavors of ice cream from 5 flavors (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mint, and coffee) to create a two-scoop ice cream cone?",
    "message_2": "To create a two-scoop ice cream cone with two different flavors, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is used to find the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order of the items. The formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, we have 5 flavors (n = 5) and we want to choose 2 flavors (k = 2). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!3!)\nC(5, 2) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\nC(5, 2) = (120) / (2 × 6)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose two different flavors of ice cream from 5 flavors to create a two-scoop ice cream cone."
