    "message_1": "A string on a guitar is 1 meter long and is fixed at both ends. If the speed of a wave on the string is 100 meters per second, what is the fundamental frequency of the string? Use complex analysis to calculate your answer.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental frequency of the string, we can use the formula:\n\nf = (v / 2L)\n\nwhere f is the fundamental frequency, v is the speed of the wave on the string (100 m/s), and L is the length of the string (1 m).\n\nf = (100 m/s) / (2 * 1 m) = 50 Hz\n\nThe fundamental frequency of the string is 50 Hz.\n\nNow, let's use complex analysis to confirm our answer. We can represent the wave on the string as a complex function:\n\nΨ(x, t) = A * exp(i(kx - ωt))\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, x is the position along the string, ω is the angular frequency, and t is the time.\n\nSince the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nΨ(0, t) = Ψ(L, t) = 0\n\nApplying the boundary conditions to our complex function:\n\nΨ(0, t) = A * exp(i(k * 0 - ωt)) = 0\nΨ(L, t) = A * exp(i(k * L - ωt)) = 0\n\nThe first boundary condition simplifies to:\n\nA * exp(-iωt) = 0\n\nSince A ≠ 0, we can conclude that exp(-iωt) ≠ 0 for all t. Thus, the first boundary condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's examine the second boundary condition:\n\nA * exp(i(k * L - ωt)) = 0\n\nAgain, since A ≠ 0, we can conclude that exp(i(k * L - ωt)) ≠ 0 for all t. This implies that k * L must be an integer multiple of 2π:\n\nk * L = n * 2π, where n is an integer\n\nNow, we can relate the wave number k to the angular frequency ω using the dispersion relation for a wave on a string:\n\nω² = (v² * k²)\n\nSubstituting k * L = n * 2π into the dispersion relation:\n\nω² = (v² * (n * 2π / L)²)\n\nFor the fundamental frequency, n = 1:\n\nω² = (v² * (1 * 2π / L)²)\n\nω = 2π * (v / 2L)\n\nNow, we can find the fundamental frequency f by dividing ω by 2π:\n\nf = ω / 2π = (v / 2L)\n\nf = (100 m/s) / (2 * 1 m) = 50 Hz\n\nUsing complex analysis, we have confirmed that the fundamental frequency of the string is 50 Hz."
