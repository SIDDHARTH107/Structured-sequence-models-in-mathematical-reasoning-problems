    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of f(z) = e^(αz), we'll use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(z) * e^(-2πikz)]dz, where the integral is taken over the real line -∞ < z < ∞.\n\nIn this case, f(z) = e^(αz), so we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(αz) * e^(-2πikz)]dz\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^((α - 2πik)z)]dz\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the fact that the integral of e^(cz) with respect to z is (1/c)e^(cz), where c is a constant. In our case, c = α - 2πik:\n\nF(k) = (1/(α - 2πik)) * e^((α - 2πik)z) evaluated from -∞ to ∞.\n\nNow, we need to consider the convergence of the integral. The integral converges if the real part of the exponent is negative, i.e., Re(α - 2πik) < 0. Since α is real, we have Re(α - 2πik) = α. Thus, the integral converges if α < 0.\n\nWhen α < 0, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nF(k) = (1/(α - 2πik)) * [e^((α - 2πik)∞) - e^((α - 2πik)(-∞))]\n\nSince α < 0, the first term goes to zero:\n\nF(k) = (1/(α - 2πik)) * [0 - e^((α - 2πik)(-∞))]\n\nThe second term goes to infinity:\n\nF(k) = (1/(α - 2πik)) * (-1)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(z) = e^(αz) for α < 0 is:\n\nF(k) = -1/(α - 2πik)"
