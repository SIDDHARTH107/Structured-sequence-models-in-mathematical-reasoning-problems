    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 4 players. Each player can choose to contribute either 0 or 2 units of money towards a public fund, where the total amount of money is multiplied by 1.5 and evenly distributed among all players. If all players contribute 2 units of money, each player will get 6 units of money. However, if any player chooses not to contribute, they will still receive an equal share of the total amount of money contributed by all players.\n\nIf Player 1 chooses to contribute 2 units of money, while Players 2, 3 and 4 choose to contribute 0 units, how much money will each player receive?",
    "message_2": "If Player 1 contributes 2 units of money and Players 2, 3, and 4 contribute 0 units, the total amount of money in the public fund will be 2 units. This amount is then multiplied by 1.5, resulting in a total of 2 * 1.5 = 3 units of money. Since the money is evenly distributed among all players, each player will receive 3 / 4 = 0.75 units of money."
