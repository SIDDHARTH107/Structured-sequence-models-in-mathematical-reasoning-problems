    "message_2": "To find the steady-state gain and phase shift of the control system, we need to evaluate the transfer function G(s) at s = jω, where ω is the input frequency in radians per second. In this case, ω = 10 rad/s.\n\nFirst, let's substitute s = jω into the transfer function:\n\nG(jω) = ((jω)^2 + 0.5(jω) + 1)/((jω)^3 + 2(jω)^2 + 2.5(jω) + 1)\n\nNow, let's plug in ω = 10:\n\nG(j10) = ((j10)^2 + 0.5(j10) + 1)/((j10)^3 + 2(j10)^2 + 2.5(j10) + 1)\n\nEvaluate the powers of jω:\n\nG(j10) = ((-100 + 5j + 1)/(1000j - 200 + 25j + 1))\n\nCombine the real and imaginary parts:\n\nG(j10) = (-99 + 5j)/(1000j - 199 + 25j)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude and phase of G(j10) to determine the steady-state gain and phase shift, respectively.\n\nThe magnitude of G(j10) is given by:\n\n|G(j10)| = sqrt((-99)^2 + (5)^2) / sqrt((-199)^2 + (1000)^2 + (25)^2)\n\n|G(j10)| ≈ 0.0995\n\nThe phase of G(j10) is given by:\n\n∠G(j10) = atan2(Im(G(j10)), Re(G(j10))) = atan2(5, -99)\n\n∠G(j10) ≈ -2.99 radians\n\nSo, the steady-state gain of the system is approximately 0.0995, and the phase shift is approximately -2.99 radians."
