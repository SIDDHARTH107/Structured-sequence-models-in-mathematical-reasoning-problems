    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a given space (in this case, a square). The construction process you described is actually the construction of the Sierpinski carpet, not the Peano curve. The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal that is formed by removing the center square and repeating the process for the remaining squares.\n\nTo find the length of the Peano curve, we need to consider the construction of the Peano curve itself. The Peano curve is constructed by dividing the square into 9 equal squares and connecting them with a continuous curve. In each iteration, the curve becomes more complex, but its length increases.\n\nIn the first iteration, the curve has a length of 1 (the side length of the square). In the second iteration, the curve is divided into 9 smaller curves, each with a length of 1/3 (since the side length of each smaller square is 1/3). So, the total length of the curve after the second iteration is 9 * (1/3) = 3.\n\nIn general, after n iterations, the length of the Peano curve is 3^n. Since the curve is continuous and fills the entire square, its length approaches infinity as the number of iterations goes to infinity. Therefore, the length of the Peano curve in a square of side length 1 is infinite."
