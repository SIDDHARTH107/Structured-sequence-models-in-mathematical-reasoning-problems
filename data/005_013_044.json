The data is as follows:\n\nMath scores: 75, 86, 92, 68, 80, 90, 78, 82, 85, 90\nScience scores: 62, 78, 80, 56, 70, 75, 72, 74, 80, 85\n\nCalculate the covariance between the Math and Science scores.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the covariance between the Math and Science scores, we first need to find the mean of each set of scores.\n\nMean of Math scores:\n(75 + 86 + 92 + 68 + 80 + 90 + 78 + 82 + 85 + 90) / 10 = 826 / 10 = 82.6\n\nMean of Science scores:\n(62 + 78 + 80 + 56 + 70 + 75 + 72 + 74 + 80 + 85) / 10 = 732 / 10 = 73.2\n\nNow, we will calculate the deviations from the mean for each score and multiply them together.\n\n(Math score - Mean of Math scores) * (Science score - Mean of Science scores)\n\n(75 - 82.6) * (62 - 73.2) = -7.6 * -11.2 = 85.12\n(86 - 82.6) * (78 - 73.2) = 3.4 * 4.8 = 16.32\n(92 - 82.6) * (80 - 73.2) = 9.4 * 6.8 = 63.92\n(68 - 82.6) * (56 - 73.2) = -14.6 * -17.2 = 251.12\n(80 - 82.6) * (70 - 73.2) = -2.6 * -3.2 = 8.32\n(90 - 82.6) * (75 - 73.2) = 7.4 * 1.8 = 13.32\n(78 - 82.6) * (72 - 73.2) = -4.6 * -1.2 = 5.52\n(82 - 82.6) * (74 - 73.2) = -0.6 * 0.8 = -0.48\n(85 - 82.6) * (80 - 73.2) = 2.4 * 6.8 = 16.32\n(90 - 82.6) * (85 - 73.2) = 7.4 * 11.8 = 87.32\n\nNow, we will sum up these products and divide by the number of data points (n) minus 1.\n\nCovariance = (85.12 + 16.32 + 63.92 + 251.12 + 8.32 + 13.32 + 5.52 - 0.48 + 16.32 + 87.32) / (10 - 1) = 546.8 / 9 = 60.76\n\nThe covariance between the Math and Science scores is 60.76."
