    "message_1": "A certain type of technological system has a 5% probability of failure on any given day. What is the probability that this system will fail at least once in a 7-day period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that the system will not fail on any day in the 7-day period, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that it will fail at least once.\n\nThe probability that the system will not fail on any given day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor the system to not fail on all 7 days, we multiply the probabilities of it not failing on each day:\n\n0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.95^7 ≈ 0.6983\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the system will fail at least once in the 7-day period:\n\n1 - 0.6983 ≈ 0.3017\n\nSo, the probability that the system will fail at least once in a 7-day period is approximately 30.17%."
