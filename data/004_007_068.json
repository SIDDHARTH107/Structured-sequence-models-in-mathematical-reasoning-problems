    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = sin(3x^2 - 5x + 1) using the chain rule, we need to differentiate the outer function (sin) and the inner function (3x^2 - 5x + 1) separately, and then multiply them together.\n\nLet u = 3x^2 - 5x + 1. Then f(x) = sin(u).\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\nd(sin(u))/du = cos(u)\n\nNext, find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\nd(3x^2 - 5x + 1)/dx = 6x - 5\n\nNow, apply the chain rule by multiplying the derivatives together:\nd(f(x))/dx = d(sin(u))/du * d(u)/dx = cos(u) * (6x - 5)\n\nFinally, substitute the original expression for u back into the equation:\nd(f(x))/dx = cos(3x^2 - 5x + 1) * (6x - 5)"
