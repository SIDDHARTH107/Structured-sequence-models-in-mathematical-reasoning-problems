    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a 64-bit message to encrypt using a block cipher that uses 128-bit keys. If the block size is 128 bits and the number of rounds is 10, how many total keys will be used in the encryption process?",
    "message_2": "In a block cipher with a 128-bit key and 10 rounds, only one key is used for the entire encryption process. The 128-bit key is expanded into a key schedule, which is a series of subkeys derived from the original key. These subkeys are used in each round of the encryption process. So, only 1 key (the original 128-bit key) is used in the encryption process, but it is expanded into multiple subkeys for the rounds."
