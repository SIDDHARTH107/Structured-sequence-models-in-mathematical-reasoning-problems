    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. We can use the Handshaking Lemma to help us find the diameter.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have 8 vertices and 12 edges, so the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 12 = 24.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum and maximum degrees of the vertices in the graph. The minimum degree of a vertex in a connected graph is 1, and the maximum degree of a vertex in a simple graph with 8 vertices is 7 (since a vertex can be connected to all other vertices).\n\nLet d_min be the minimum degree and d_max be the maximum degree of the vertices in G. Since the sum of the degrees is 24, we have:\n\n8 * d_min ≤ 24 ≤ 8 * d_max\n\nDividing by 8, we get:\n\nd_min ≤ 3 ≤ d_max\n\nSince the graph is connected, the minimum degree must be at least 1. Therefore, the possible values for d_min are 1, 2, or 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the diameter of the graph for each possible value of d_min:\n\n1. If d_min = 1, then there is a vertex with degree 1, which means it is connected to only one other vertex. In this case, the diameter of the graph is at least 6, as there are 6 other vertices that need to be traversed to reach the vertex with degree 1.\n\n2. If d_min = 2, then there is a vertex with degree 2, which means it is connected to two other vertices. In this case, the diameter of the graph is at least 5, as there are 5 other vertices that need to be traversed to reach the vertex with degree 2.\n\n3. If d_min = 3, then every vertex has a degree of at least 3. In this case, the diameter of the graph is at most 4, as every vertex is connected to at least 3 other vertices, allowing for shorter paths between vertices.\n\nSince we want to find the longest shortest path, we should consider the largest possible diameter. Therefore, the diameter of the graph G is 4."
