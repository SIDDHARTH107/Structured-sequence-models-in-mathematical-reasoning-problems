    "message_2": "Let's consider two odd integers, say a and b. By definition, odd integers can be written in the form 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, let a = 2m + 1 and b = 2n + 1, where m and n are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the product of a and b:\n\na * b = (2m + 1)(2n + 1)\n\nUsing the distributive property, we get:\n\na * b = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the terms 4mn, 2m, and 2n:\n\na * b = 2(2mn + m + n) + 1\n\nLet k = 2mn + m + n, where k is an integer (since the sum and product of integers are also integers).\n\nSo, a * b = 2k + 1\n\nSince a * b is in the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer, the product of any two odd integers (a and b) is also an odd integer."
