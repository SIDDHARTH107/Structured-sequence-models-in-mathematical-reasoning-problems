    "message_1": "A bookstore owner has 6 books by author A and 4 books by author B. In how many ways can the owner arrange these books on a shelf such that no two books by author A are adjacent to each other? Use Catalan numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "We can use the concept of Catalan numbers to solve this problem. Let's consider the books by author B as the dividers between the books by author A. Since there are 4 books by author B, we have 5 possible positions (including the ends) to place the 6 books by author A. We can represent this as a sequence of 4 dividers (B) and 6 books (A) to be placed in the 5 positions.\n\nThe problem can now be rephrased as finding the number of ways to arrange 4 dividers (B) and 6 books (A) in the 5 positions such that no two books by author A are adjacent to each other. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using Catalan numbers.\n\nThe nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nIn our case, n = 4 (since there are 4 dividers). Therefore, we can calculate the 4th Catalan number as follows:\n\nC(4) = (1/(4+1)) * (2*4 choose 4)\nC(4) = (1/5) * (8 choose 4)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the binomial coefficient (8 choose 4):\n\n(8 choose 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\n(8 choose 4) = 8! / (4! * 4!)\n(8 choose 4) = 40320 / (24 * 24)\n(8 choose 4) = 70\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the Catalan number formula:\n\nC(4) = (1/5) * 70\nC(4) = 14\n\nSo, there are 14 ways to arrange the books on the shelf such that no two books by author A are adjacent to each other."
