    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 24, 36, and 54, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n54 = 2^1 * 3^3\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n2^3 (from 24), 3^3 (from 54)\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^3 * 3^3 = 8 * 27 = 216\n\nThe LCM of 24, 36, and 54 is 216."
