    "message_1": "A water wave is described by the function h(x, t) = 0.5 sin(3x - 12t), where x is the horizontal distance and t is time. Using the Fourier transform, find the frequency and amplitude of the wave.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency and amplitude of the wave, we need to analyze the given wave function h(x, t) = 0.5 sin(3x - 12t). This is a sinusoidal wave function of the form h(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt), where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nComparing the given function with the general form, we have:\n\nA = 0.5\nk = 3\nω = 12\n\nNow, we can find the frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) of the wave using the following relationships:\n\nω = 2πf\nk = 2π/λ\n\nFirst, let's find the frequency (f):\n\nω = 12 = 2πf\nf = ω / (2π) = 12 / (2π) = 6/π Hz\n\nNow, let's find the wavelength (λ):\n\nk = 3 = 2π/λ\nλ = 2π/k = 2π/3 m\n\nSo, the amplitude of the wave is 0.5 units, the frequency is 6/π Hz, and the wavelength is 2π/3 m."
