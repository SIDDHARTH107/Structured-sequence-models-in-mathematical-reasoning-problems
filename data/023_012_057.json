    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = [x], we first need to determine the period of the function. Since the greatest integer function has a period of 1, we will consider the interval [0, 1) for our Fourier series.\n\nThe general formula for a Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ(an * cos(nπx/L) + bn * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function, an and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor our function, L = 1/2, so the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ(an * cos(2nπx) + bn * sin(2nπx))\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier coefficients a0, an, and bn. We can do this using the following formulas:\n\na0 = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * 1) dx over the interval [0, L]\nan = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * cos(2nπx)) dx over the interval [0, L]\nbn = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(2nπx)) dx over the interval [0, L]\n\nFor f(x) = [x], we have:\n\na0 = (1/0.5) * ∫(x) dx from 0 to 0.5 = 2 * (0.5^2 / 2) = 0.5\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, all an coefficients will be zero.\n\nNow, we need to find the bn coefficients:\n\nbn = (1/0.5) * ∫(x * sin(2nπx)) dx from 0 to 0.5\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(2nπx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/(2nπ)) * cos(2nπx)\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts:\n\n∫(x * sin(2nπx)) dx = -x * (1/(2nπ)) * cos(2nπx) + (1/(2nπ)) * ∫(cos(2nπx)) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining term:\n\n∫(cos(2nπx)) dx = (1/(2nπ)) * sin(2nπx)\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nbn = 2 * (-x * (1/(2nπ)) * cos(2nπx) + (1/(4n^2π^2)) * sin(2nπx)) evaluated from 0 to 0.5\n\nbn = -((1/nπ) * cos(nπ) - (1/nπ)) = (1/nπ) * (1 - cos(nπ))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = [x]:\n\nf(x) = 0.5/2 + Σ((1/nπ) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(2nπx))\n\nf(x) = 1/4 + Σ((1/nπ) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(2nπx)) for n = 1 to infinity"
