    "message_2": "Mori theory is not applicable to finding the equation of a line passing through two points, as it is a mathematical theory in algebraic geometry. Instead, we can use the standard method of finding the slope and the y-intercept to determine the equation of the line.\n\nGiven two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the slope (m) of the line passing through these points can be found using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nIn this case, the two points are (3, 4) and (5, 1). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nm = (1 - 4) / (5 - 3) = (-3) / 2\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the point (3, 4) and the slope -3/2, we get:\n\ny - 4 = (-3/2)(x - 3)\n\nTo find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), we can solve for y:\n\ny = (-3/2)(x - 3) + 4\n\ny = (-3/2)x + 9/2 + 4\n\ny = (-3/2)x + 9/2 + 8/2\n\ny = (-3/2)x + 17/2\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (5, 1) is:\n\ny = (-3/2)x + 17/2"
