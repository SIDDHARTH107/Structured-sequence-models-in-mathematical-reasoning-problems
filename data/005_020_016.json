    "message_2": "To estimate the value of π using a Monte Carlo simulation, we generate random points inside a unit square and calculate the ratio of points that fall inside a quarter of a unit circle. The area of the unit square is 1, and the area of the quarter of a unit circle is (π * 1²) / 4 = π / 4. Therefore, the ratio of points inside the quarter circle to the total points should be approximately equal to π / 4.\n\nLet X be the number of points that fall inside the quarter of a unit circle. X follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 10,000 (number of random points) and p = π / 4 (probability of a point falling inside the quarter circle).\n\nTo calculate the 95% confidence interval for our estimate of π, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution since n is large. The mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of a binomial distribution are given by:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1 - p))\n\nWe can estimate p using the sample proportion, p_hat = X / n. Then, we can use the standard error (SE) to calculate the confidence interval:\n\nSE = σ / sqrt(n) = sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n)\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for p_hat is given by:\n\n(p_hat - 1.96 * SE, p_hat + 1.96 * SE)\n\nFinally, we can convert this confidence interval for p_hat to a confidence interval for π by multiplying the endpoints by 4:\n\n(4 * (p_hat - 1.96 * SE), 4 * (p_hat + 1.96 * SE))\n\nSince we don't have the actual value of X (the number of points inside the quarter circle), we cannot calculate the exact confidence interval. However, we can provide the general formula for the 95% confidence interval for π based on the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n(4 * (p_hat - 1.96 * sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n)), 4 * (p_hat + 1.96 * sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n)))"
