    "message_1": "There are six coins in a bag. Three coins are ordinary quarters, two are ordinary nickels, and one is a \"double-headed\" nickel, which has the same face on both sides. A coin is drawn at random from the bag and tossed, and it lands heads-up. What is the probability that the coin is the double-headed nickel?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the probability of each coin landing heads-up.\n\n1. Ordinary quarters: There are 3 ordinary quarters, and each has a 1/2 chance of landing heads-up.\n2. Ordinary nickels: There are 2 ordinary nickels, and each has a 1/2 chance of landing heads-up.\n3. Double-headed nickel: There is 1 double-headed nickel, and it has a 1 (100%) chance of landing heads-up.\n\nNow let's find the probability of drawing each coin and it landing heads-up.\n\n1. Ordinary quarters: (3/6) * (1/2) = 1/4\n2. Ordinary nickels: (2/6) * (1/2) = 1/6\n3. Double-headed nickel: (1/6) * (1) = 1/6\n\nTo find the probability of the coin being the double-headed nickel given that it landed heads-up, we can use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, event A is the coin being the double-headed nickel, and event B is the coin landing heads-up.\n\nP(A and B) = probability of drawing the double-headed nickel and it landing heads-up = 1/6\nP(B) = probability of any coin landing heads-up = 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 6/12 = 1/2\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A|B) = (1/6) / (1/2) = (1/6) * (2/1) = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nSo the probability that the coin is the double-headed nickel given that it landed heads-up is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333."
