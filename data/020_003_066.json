    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit obtained from selling a unit of A is $10 and that from selling a unit of B is $15. The production process requires 2 units of machine time for A and 3 units for B. The total machine time available per week is 240 units. Write a mathematical model and find the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce per week to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced per week.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraint (machine time): 2x + 3y ≤ 240\n\nNon-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P = 10x + 15y subject to the constraint 2x + 3y ≤ 240 and non-negativity constraints.\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will use the graphical method. First, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraint:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 240\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n(2/3)x + y ≤ 80\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection with the x-axis (y = 0): 2x = 240, x = 120\n   Point: (120, 0)\n\n2. Intersection with the y-axis (x = 0): 3y = 240, y = 80\n   Point: (0, 80)\n\n3. Intersection between the constraint line and the x-axis: (2/3)x + y = 80\n   Multiply both sides by 3: 2x + 3y = 240\n   Solve for x: x = 60\n   Solve for y: y = 40\n   Point: (60, 40)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\n\n1. P(120, 0) = 10(120) + 15(0) = 1200\n2. P(0, 80) = 10(0) + 15(80) = 1200\n3. P(60, 40) = 10(60) + 15(40) = 600 + 600 = 1200\n\nAll three corner points yield the same maximum profit of $1200. This means that there are multiple optimal solutions along the line segment connecting the points (120, 0) and (0, 80). The company can produce any combination of product A and product B along this line segment to achieve the maximum profit of $1200 per week."
