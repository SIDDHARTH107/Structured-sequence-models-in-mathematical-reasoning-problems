    "message_1": "A company that produces light bulbs claims that the life span of their bulbs follow a normal distribution with a mean of 2000 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. What is the probability that a bulb chosen at random from this company will last:\na) between 1900 and 2100 hours?\nb) more than 2200 hours?\nc) less than 1800 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve these problems, we will use the z-score formula and standard normal distribution table. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\na) Between 1900 and 2100 hours:\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores for 1900 and 2100 hours:\n\nz1 = (1900 - 2000) / 100 = -1\nz2 = (2100 - 2000) / 100 = 1\n\nNow, we will look up the probabilities for these z-scores in the standard normal distribution table:\n\nP(z1) = P(-1) ≈ 0.1587\nP(z2) = P(1) ≈ 0.8413\n\nThe probability of a bulb lasting between 1900 and 2100 hours is the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(1900 < X < 2100) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, there is a 68.26% chance that a bulb will last between 1900 and 2100 hours.\n\nb) More than 2200 hours:\n\nFirst, find the z-score for 2200 hours:\n\nz = (2200 - 2000) / 100 = 2\n\nNow, look up the probability for this z-score in the standard normal distribution table:\n\nP(z) = P(2) ≈ 0.9772\n\nSince we want the probability of a bulb lasting more than 2200 hours, we need to find the area to the right of z = 2:\n\nP(X > 2200) = 1 - P(z) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228\n\nSo, there is a 2.28% chance that a bulb will last more than 2200 hours.\n\nc) Less than 1800 hours:\n\nFirst, find the z-score for 1800 hours:\n\nz = (1800 - 2000) / 100 = -2\n\nNow, look up the probability for this z-score in the standard normal distribution table:\n\nP(z) = P(-2) ≈ 0.0228\n\nSince we want the probability of a bulb lasting less than 1800 hours, we can use the probability directly from the table:\n\nP(X < 1800) = P(z) = 0.0228\n\nSo, there is a 2.28% chance that a bulb will last less than 1800 hours."
