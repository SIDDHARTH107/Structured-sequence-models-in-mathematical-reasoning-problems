    "message_1": "Consider a sequence where the first term is 1 and each subsequent term is equal to the sum of the two previous terms. For example, the first few terms of the sequence are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... \n\nWrite a recurrence relation for the nth term of the sequence, and use it to find the 10th term.",
    "message_2": "The sequence described is known as the Fibonacci sequence. The recurrence relation for the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence can be written as:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\n\nwith the initial conditions:\n\nF(1) = 1\nF(2) = 1\n\nTo find the 10th term of the sequence, we can use the recurrence relation and the initial conditions:\n\nF(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2\nF(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 3 + 2 = 5\nF(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 5 + 3 = 8\nF(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 8 + 5 = 13\nF(8) = F(7) + F(6) = 13 + 8 = 21\nF(9) = F(8) + F(7) = 21 + 13 = 34\nF(10) = F(9) + F(8) = 34 + 21 = 55\n\nSo, the 10th term of the sequence is 55."
