    "message_1": "Assuming that \"P\" represents the statement \"It is sunny outside\" and \"Q\" represents the statement \"I will go to the beach\", translate the logical expression \"(P and not Q) or (not P and Q)\" into words and determine its truth value if P is true and Q is false.",
    "message_2": "The logical expression \"(P and not Q) or (not P and Q)\" can be translated into words as follows:\n\n\"It is sunny outside and I will not go to the beach, or it is not sunny outside and I will go to the beach.\"\n\nNow, let's determine its truth value given that P is true (it is sunny outside) and Q is false (I will not go to the beach).\n\nWe can break down the expression into two parts:\n\n1. (P and not Q): Since P is true and Q is false, this part becomes \"True and not False,\" which is true.\n\n2. (not P and Q): Since P is true and Q is false, this part becomes \"not True and False,\" which is false.\n\nNow, combining the two parts with the \"or\" operator:\n\n(True) or (False)\n\nThe \"or\" operator requires only one of the two parts to be true for the entire expression to be true. Since the first part is true, the entire expression is true."
