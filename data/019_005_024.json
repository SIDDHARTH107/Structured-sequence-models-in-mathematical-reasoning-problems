    "message_1": "In a room, there are three closed boxes: one contains an apple, another contains a banana, and the third contains an orange. You don't know which box contains which fruit. Your friend knows which box contains which fruit, but he is not telling you. You ask your friend if the box containing the apple is the same as the box containing the banana, but he only answers with \"yes\" or \"no.\" What is your chance of guessing which box contains the orange if your friend answers \"yes\"?",
    "message_2": "If your friend answers \"yes\" to your question, it means that the apple and the banana are in the same box. Since there are three boxes and each box contains only one fruit, the third box must contain the orange. In this case, your chance of guessing which box contains the orange is 100%."
