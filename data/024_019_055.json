    "message_2": "To determine the total Gaussian curvature of the resulting surface, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature of the original sphere and then subtract the Gaussian curvature of the removed circular region.\n\nThe Gaussian curvature (K) of a sphere with radius R is given by the formula:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nFor the original sphere with radius 6 cm, the Gaussian curvature is:\n\nK_sphere = 1/(6^2) = 1/36\n\nNow, let's find the Gaussian curvature of the removed circular region. The hole has a diameter of 2 cm, so its radius is 1 cm. Since the hole is drilled through the sphere, the removed region is a portion of the sphere with radius 1 cm. The Gaussian curvature of this region is:\n\nK_hole = 1/(1^2) = 1\n\nTo find the total Gaussian curvature of the resulting surface, we need to find the ratio of the surface areas of the removed region and the original sphere. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\nA = 4πR^2\n\nThe surface area of the original sphere is:\n\nA_sphere = 4π(6^2) = 144π\n\nThe surface area of the removed circular region is a portion of the surface area of a sphere with radius 1 cm:\n\nA_hole = 4π(1^2) = 4π\n\nNow, we find the ratio of the surface areas:\n\nratio = A_hole / A_sphere = 4π / 144π = 1/36\n\nFinally, we subtract the Gaussian curvature of the removed region, weighted by the ratio of the surface areas, from the Gaussian curvature of the original sphere:\n\nK_result = K_sphere - ratio * K_hole = 1/36 - 1/36 * 1 = 1/36 - 1/36 = 0\n\nThe total Gaussian curvature of the resulting surface is 0."
