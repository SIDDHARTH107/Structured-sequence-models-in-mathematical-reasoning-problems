    "message_2": "To find the volume form associated with the given metric, we first need to find the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for the given metric is a diagonal matrix with the coefficients of the differentials:\n\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 9 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 16\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this diagonal matrix is simply the product of its diagonal elements:\n\n$$\n\\det(g) = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 16 = 576\n$$\n\nNow, the volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume form in Euclidean space, which is $dx_1 \\wedge dx_2 \\wedge dx_3$:\n\n$$\n\\text{vol} = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx_1 \\wedge dx_2 \\wedge dx_3 = \\sqrt{576} \\, dx_1 \\wedge dx_2 \\wedge dx_3\n$$\n\nSo, the volume form associated with the given metric at point $(1,2,3)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{vol} = 24 \\, dx_1 \\wedge dx_2 \\wedge dx_3\n$$"
