    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the logarithmic property:\n\nlog(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)\n\nSo, the given expression can be written as:\n\nlog(base 2)(64/8)\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction inside the logarithm:\n\n64 รท 8 = 8\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\nlog(base 2)(8)\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent to which the base (2) must be raised to obtain the number inside the logarithm (8). In other words, we need to find x in the equation:\n\n2^x = 8\n\n2^x = 2^3 (since 2 * 2 * 2 = 8)\n\nSince the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal as well:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\nlog(base 2)(8) = 3"
