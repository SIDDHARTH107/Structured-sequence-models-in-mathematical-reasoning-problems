    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 5 players who need to decide how much money to contribute to a public good that will benefit all of them. Each player can choose to contribute between $0 to $10. The total contribution of all players will be multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and then divided equally among all 5 players. If a player does not contribute, they will still benefit from the public good, but they will not receive a share of the multiplied contribution. \n\nIf 3 players decide to contribute $5 each and the other 2 players contribute nothing, how much money will each player receive as their share of the multiplied contribution?",
    "message_2": "If 3 players contribute $5 each, the total contribution is 3 * $5 = $15. This total contribution will be multiplied by a factor of 1.5, so the multiplied contribution is $15 * 1.5 = $22.5. This multiplied contribution will be divided equally among all 5 players, so each player will receive $22.5 / 5 = $4.50 as their share of the multiplied contribution."
