    "message_1": "A possible mathematical question related to Epistemic logic is:\n\n\"Suppose two mathematicians, Alice and Bob, are having a conversation about a logical problem. Alice knows the answer, but Bob doesn't. If Alice says 'I know the answer, but you don't', what can we infer about the truth of the statement 'The answer is odd'?\"\n\nAssume that both Alice and Bob are perfect logicians and that they have shared knowledge about the problem, but only Alice has private knowledge of the answer. The task for the student is to use the principles of Epistemic logic to determine whether the statement \"The answer is odd\" is true, false, or uncertain, and to explain why.",
    "message_2": "To analyze this problem using Epistemic logic, we need to consider the knowledge and beliefs of both Alice and Bob.\n\n1. Alice knows the answer, and Bob doesn't. This means that there is some information that Alice has that Bob does not have.\n\n2. Alice says, \"I know the answer, but you don't.\" Since Alice and Bob are perfect logicians, Bob can trust that Alice is telling the truth.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The answer is odd.\"\n\nWe cannot infer whether the statement is true or false based on the given information. Alice's knowledge of the answer and her statement do not provide any information about the parity (oddness or evenness) of the answer. \n\nHowever, we can infer that Bob's uncertainty about the answer remains. Alice's statement confirms that she knows the answer, but it does not provide any new information to Bob that would help him determine whether the answer is odd or even.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the principles of Epistemic logic, we cannot determine whether the statement \"The answer is odd\" is true or false. The truth of the statement remains uncertain."
