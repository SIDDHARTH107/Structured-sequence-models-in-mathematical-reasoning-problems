    "message_2": "To find an analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the region $\\Omega'$ using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find a function that is analytic in both $\\Omega$ and $\\Omega'$ and agrees with $f(z)$ on the boundary between the two regions. The boundary between $\\Omega$ and $\\Omega'$ is the real axis, i.e., the set of points $z = x$ with $-2 < x < 2$.\n\nLet's consider the function $g(z) = f(z)f(-z)$. We have:\n\n$$g(z) = f(z)f(-z) = \\frac{1+z}{z-2} \\cdot \\frac{1-z}{-z-2} = \\frac{(1+z)(1-z)}{(z-2)(-z-2)} = \\frac{1 - z^2}{z^2 - 4}.$$\n\nNotice that $g(z)$ is analytic in both $\\Omega$ and $\\Omega'$, since the only singularities of $g(z)$ are at $z = \\pm 2$, which are not in either region. Moreover, $g(z)$ agrees with $f(z)$ on the boundary between the two regions, since for $z = x$ with $-2 < x < 2$, we have:\n\n$$g(x) = \\frac{1 - x^2}{x^2 - 4} = \\frac{1 + x}{x - 2} = f(x).$$\n\nNow, we can define the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to $\\Omega'$ as follows:\n\n$$f'(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{f(z)} = \\frac{\\frac{1 - z^2}{z^2 - 4}}{\\frac{1+z}{z-2}} = \\frac{1 - z^2}{(1+z)(-z-2)}.$$\n\nFinally, we can compute $f'(i)$ using the continuation:\n\n$$f'(i) = \\frac{1 - i^2}{(1+i)(-i-2)} = \\frac{1 + 1}{(1+i)(-i-2)} = \\frac{2}{(1+i)(-2-i)}.$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\n$$f'(i) = \\frac{2(-2+i)}{(1+i)(-2-i)(-2+i)} = \\frac{-4+2i}{(1+i)(3+3i)} = \\frac{-4+2i}{(1+i)(3+3i)} \\cdot \\frac{1-i}{1-i} = \\frac{-4+2i}{4} = -1 + \\frac{1}{2}i.$$\n\nThus, the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the region $\\Omega'$ is given by $f'(z) = \\frac{1 - z^2}{(1+z)(-z-2)}$, and $f'(i) = -1 + \\frac{1}{2}i$."
