    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 3  4 -2 | 1\n| 2  3  1 | 2\n| 5 -1  3 | 3\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\nDivide the first row by 3:\n\n| 1  4/3 -2/3 | 1/3\n| 2  3    1   | 2\n| 5 -1    3   | 3\n\nSubtract 2 times the first row from the second row and 5 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  4/3 -2/3 | 1/3\n| 0  1/3  4/3 | 4/3\n| 0 -11/3 11  | 8/3\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\nDivide the second row by 1/3:\n\n| 1  4/3 -2/3 | 1/3\n| 0    1   4  | 4\n| 0 -11/3 11  | 8/3\n\nAdd (11/3) times the second row to the third row:\n\n| 1  4/3 -2/3 | 1/3\n| 0    1   4  | 4\n| 0    0   25 | 40/3\n\nStep 3: Solve for z, y, and x using back-substitution.\nDivide the third row by 25:\n\n| 1  4/3 -2/3 | 1/3\n| 0    1   4  | 4\n| 0    0   1  | 8/15\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = 8/15\n\ny = 4 - 4z = 4 - 4(8/15) = 52/15\n\nx = 1/3 - (4/3)y + (2/3)z = 1/3 - (4/3)(52/15) + (2/3)(8/15) = -14/15\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -14/15\ny = 52/15\nz = 8/15"
