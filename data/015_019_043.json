    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, which is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - 1/3*y^3\n\nwhere x and y are the position coordinates, and p_x and p_y are the corresponding momentum coordinates. The initial conditions are given by (x, y, p_x, p_y) = (0.2, -0.8, 0, 0.4).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total energy of the system using the initial conditions:\n\nH(0.2, -0.8, 0, 0.4) = 1/2 (0^2 + 0.4^2) + 1/2 (0.2^2 + (-0.8)^2) + (0.2^2)*(-0.8) - 1/3*(-0.8)^3\nH(0.2, -0.8, 0, 0.4) = 1/2 (0 + 0.16) + 1/2 (0.04 + 0.64) - 0.032 + 0.341333\nH(0.2, -0.8, 0, 0.4) = 0.08 + 0.34 - 0.032 + 0.341333\nH(0.2, -0.8, 0, 0.4) ≈ 0.729333\n\nThe total energy of the system is approximately 0.729333.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is given by:\n\nK(p_x, p_y) = 1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2)\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, we can write:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = K(p_x, p_y) + V(x, y)\n\nwhere V(x, y) is the potential energy. To find the maximum kinetic energy, we need to find the minimum potential energy. The potential energy is given by:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - 1/3*y^3\n\nThe minimum potential energy can be found by analyzing the stationary points of V(x, y), which are the points where the gradient of V(x, y) is zero. However, finding the minimum potential energy analytically is not trivial. Instead, we can use numerical methods to find the minimum potential energy.\n\nAssuming we have found the minimum potential energy V_min, we can find the maximum kinetic energy as follows:\n\nK_max = H - V_min\n\nSince we don't have an analytical solution for V_min, we cannot provide an exact value for the maximum kinetic energy. However, you can use numerical methods to find the minimum potential energy and then calculate the maximum kinetic energy using the formula above."
