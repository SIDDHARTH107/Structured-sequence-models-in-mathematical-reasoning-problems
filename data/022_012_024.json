    "message_2": "To find the number of poles of the meromorphic function, we first need to find the singularities of the function. A singularity occurs when the denominator of the function is equal to zero.\n\nLet's find the zeros of the denominator:\n\n$z^3 - 4z = 0$\n\nWe can factor out a z:\n\n$z(z^2 - 4) = 0$\n\nNow we can factor the quadratic term:\n\n$z(z - 2)(z + 2) = 0$\n\nSo, the zeros of the denominator are $z = 0$, $z = 2$, and $z = -2$. These are the singularities of the function.\n\nNow we need to determine if these singularities are poles. A singularity is a pole if the order of the zero in the denominator is greater than the order of the zero in the numerator at that point.\n\n1. For $z = 0$, the order of the zero in the denominator is 1 (since it's a simple factor of z). The order of the zero in the numerator is 0 (since there's no z term in the numerator). Since the order of the zero in the denominator is greater than the order of the zero in the numerator, $z = 0$ is a pole.\n\n2. For $z = 2$, the order of the zero in the denominator is 1 (since it's a simple factor of (z - 2)). The order of the zero in the numerator is 0 (since 2 is not a root of the numerator). Since the order of the zero in the denominator is greater than the order of the zero in the numerator, $z = 2$ is a pole.\n\n3. For $z = -2$, the order of the zero in the denominator is 1 (since it's a simple factor of (z + 2)). The order of the zero in the numerator is 0 (since -2 is not a root of the numerator). Since the order of the zero in the denominator is greater than the order of the zero in the numerator, $z = -2$ is a pole.\n\nThus, the meromorphic function $f(z) = \\frac{2z^2+3z-1}{z^3-4z}$ has 3 poles in the complex plane."
