    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the singularity at z = 2 of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1) / (z - 2)^3, we first need to determine if the singularity is removable, a pole, or an essential singularity.\n\nA singularity is removable if the function can be redefined at the singular point to make the function continuous. A singularity is a pole if the function approaches infinity as z approaches the singular point. An essential singularity is a singularity that is neither removable nor a pole.\n\nIn this case, the function f(z) has a singularity at z = 2 because the denominator (z - 2)^3 becomes zero at this point. To determine the type of singularity, we can look at the order of the numerator and denominator at the singular point.\n\nThe order of the numerator is 2, as the highest power of z in the numerator is z^2. The order of the denominator is 3, as the highest power of z in the denominator is (z - 2)^3.\n\nSince the order of the denominator is greater than the order of the numerator, the singularity at z = 2 is a pole. The order of the pole is equal to the difference between the orders of the denominator and numerator, which is 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nSo, the singularity at z = 2 is a pole of order 1."
