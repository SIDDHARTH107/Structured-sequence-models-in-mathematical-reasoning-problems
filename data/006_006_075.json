    "message_1": "A basketball player has a free throw percentage of 75%. What is the probability that he will make all 5 free throws in a row?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the basketball player will make all 5 free throws in a row, we need to multiply the probability of making each individual free throw together. Since the player has a 75% free throw percentage, the probability of making each free throw is 0.75.\n\nSo, the probability of making all 5 free throws in a row is:\n\n0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.2373 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the probability of making all 5 free throws in a row is approximately 23.73%."
