    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\ndot_product = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nVector A: (-4, 3)\n|A| = √((-4)^2 + (3)^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n\nVector B: (5, 2)\n|B| = √((5)^2 + (2)^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A_x * B_x + A_y * B_y) / (|A| * |B|)\n\ncos(θ) = ((-4) * (5) + (3) * (2)) / (5 * √29) = (-20 + 6) / (5√29) = -14 / (5√29)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product:\n\ndot_product = |A| * |B| * cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * (-14 / (5√29))\n\nThe √29 and 5 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\ndot_product = -14\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors is -14."
