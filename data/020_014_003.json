Product A requires 10 hours of production time and generates a profit of $50, while Product B requires 15 hours of production time and generates a profit of $75. Write a non-convex optimization problem to determine the number of units of each product the company should produce in order to maximize its weekly profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P(x, y) = 50x + 75y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Production time constraint: 10x + 15y ≤ 2000\n2. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n3.
