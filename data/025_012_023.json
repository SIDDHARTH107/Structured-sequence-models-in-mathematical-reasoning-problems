We can do this by plugging in all possible x values (0 to 10) and checking if the resulting y^2 is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n\nThe elliptic curve is given by the equation: $y^2 = x^3 + 2x - 5 \\pmod{11}$\n\nLet's find all the points on the curve:\n\nFor x = 0: $y^2 = 0^3 + 2(0) - 5 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$\nThere are no solutions for y since 6 is not a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n\nFor x = 1: $y^2 = 1^3 + 2(1) - 5 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$\ny = 5, 6 (since $5^2 \\equiv 6^2 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$)\nPoints: (1, 5), (1, 6)\n\nFor x = 2: $y^2 = 2^3 + 2(2) - 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$\nThere are no solutions for y since 3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n\nFor x = 3: $y^2 = 3^3 + 2(3) - 5 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$\nThere are no solutions for y since 7 is not a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n\nFor x = 4: $y^2 = 4^3 + 2(4) - 5 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$\ny = 3, 8 (since $3^2 \\equiv 8^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$)\nPoints: (4, 3), (4, 8)\n\nFor x = 5: $y^2 = 5^3 + 2(5) - 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$\ny = 0\nPoint: (5, 0)\n\nFor x = 6: $y^2 = 6^3 + 2(6) - 5 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$\ny = 3, 8 (since $3^2 \\equiv 8^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$)\nPoints: (6, 3), (6, 8)\n\nFor x = 7: $y^2 = 7^3 + 2(7) - 5 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$\nThere are no solutions for y since 7 is not a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n\nFor x = 8: $y^2 = 8^3 + 2(8) - 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$\nThere are no solutions for y since 3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n\nFor x = 9: $y^2 = 9^3 + 2(9) - 5 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$\ny = 5, 6 (since $5^2 \\equiv 6^2 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$)\nPoints: (9, 5), (9, 6)\n\nFor x = 10: $y^2 = 10^3 + 2(10) - 5 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$\nThere are no solutions for y since 6 is not a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n\nNow we have the points on the curve: (1, 5), (1, 6), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 0), (6, 3), (6, 8), (9, 5), (9, 6)\n\nTo find the points of order 5, we need to check which of these points, when added to themselves 4 times, result in the point at infinity (the identity element for the elliptic curve).\n\nUsing the formulas for point addition on elliptic curves, we can compute 4 times each point:\n\n4 * (1, 5) = (9, 6)\n4 * (1, 6) = (9, 5)\n4 * (4, 3) = (6, 8)\n4 * (4, 8) = (6, 3)\n4 * (5, 0) = (5, 0)\n4 * (6, 3) = (4, 8)\n4 * (6, 8) = (4, 3)\n4 * (9, 5) = (1, 6)\n4 * (9, 6) = (1, 5)\n\nNone of the points have order 5 since none of them result in the point at infinity when added to themselves 4 times."
