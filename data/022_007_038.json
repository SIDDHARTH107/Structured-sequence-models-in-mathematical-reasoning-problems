    "message_1": "Suppose that a polynomial function $p(z) = az^3+bz^2+cz+d$ is given such that $|p(z)|\\leq 5$ for all $|z|=4$. Show that $p(z)$ is a constant polynomial.",
    "message_2": "Assume for the sake of contradiction that $p(z)$ is not a constant polynomial. Then, at least one of the coefficients $a, b, c$ is non-zero.\n\nConsider the function $q(z) = \\frac{p(z)}{z^3} = a + \\frac{b}{z} + \\frac{c}{z^2} + \\frac{d}{z^3}$. Note that $q(z)$ is a continuous function on the closed disk $|z| \\leq 4$ and differentiable on the open disk $|z| < 4$. \n\nNow, let's examine the behavior of $q(z)$ on the boundary $|z|=4$. We have:\n\n$$|q(z)| = \\left| a + \\frac{b}{z} + \\frac{c}{z^2} + \\frac{d}{z^3} \\right| \\leq \\left| a + \\frac{b}{4} + \\frac{c}{16} + \\frac{d}{64} \\right|$$\n\nSince $|p(z)| \\leq 5$ for all $|z|=4$, we have:\n\n$$\\left| a + \\frac{b}{4} + \\frac{c}{16} + \\frac{d}{64} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{p(z)}{z^3} \\right| \\leq \\frac{5}{64}$$\n\nNow, let's apply the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) on an open disk and continuous on its closure, then the maximum of the modulus of the function on the closed disk is attained on the boundary of the disk.\n\nSince $q(z)$ is continuous on the closed disk $|z| \\leq 4$ and differentiable on the open disk $|z| < 4$, the Maximum Modulus Principle applies. Thus, the maximum of $|q(z)|$ on the closed disk $|z| \\leq 4$ is attained on the boundary $|z|=4$. However, we have shown that $|q(z)| \\leq \\frac{5}{64}$ on the boundary, so the maximum of $|q(z)|$ on the closed disk is at most $\\frac{5}{64}$.\n\nNow, consider the limit as $z$ approaches infinity:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} q(z) = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\left( a + \\frac{b}{z} + \\frac{c}{z^2} + \\frac{d}{z^3} \\right) = a$$\n\nSince $|q(z)| \\leq \\frac{5}{64}$ on the closed disk $|z| \\leq 4$, we must have $|a| \\leq \\frac{5}{64}$. However, if $a$ is non-zero, then for sufficiently large $z$, the term $az^3$ will dominate the other terms in $p(z)$, and the inequality $|p(z)| \\leq 5$ for all $|z|=4$ will be violated. Therefore, we must have $a=0$.\n\nNow, we have $p(z) = bz^2 + cz + d$. Repeating the same argument with the function $r(z) = \\frac{p(z)}{z^2} = b + \\frac{c}{z} + \\frac{d}{z^2}$, we can show that $b=0$ as well. \n\nFinally, we have $p(z) = cz + d$. Repeating the argument one more time with the function $s(z) = \\frac{p(z)}{z} = c + \\frac{d}{z}$, we can show that $c=0$.\n\nThus, we have $p(z) = d$, which is a constant polynomial, contradicting our initial assumption. Therefore, $p(z)$ must be a constant polynomial."
