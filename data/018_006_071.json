    "message_2": "To find the union of {1, 2, 3, 4} and C, we combine all the elements of both sets without any repetition. Since C is the complement of {1, 2, 3, 4} in U, it contains all the elements in U that are not in {1, 2, 3, 4}. Therefore, when we take the union of {1, 2, 3, 4} and C, we are essentially combining all the elements in U.\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of {1, 2, 3, 4} and C is equal to U.\n\nProof:\n\nLet A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = C. We want to show that A ∪ B = U.\n\nBy definition of the complement, A ∩ B = ∅ (i.e., A and B have no elements in common), and A ∪ B contains all the elements in U.\n\nSince A is a subset of U, all elements of A are also elements of U. Similarly, since B is the complement of A in U, all elements of B are also elements of U. Therefore, every element in A ∪ B is an element of U, which means A ∪ B is a subset of U.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element x in U. Since A and B are complementary subsets of U, x must either belong to A or B (or both, but in this case, A and B have no elements in common). Therefore, x is an element of A ∪ B. Since x was an arbitrary element of U, this implies that every element of U is also an element of A ∪ B, which means U is a subset of A ∪ B.\n\nSince A ∪ B is a subset of U and U is a subset of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B = U."
