Find the equation of motion that represents the displacement of the mass over time, and the maximum displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for the mass-spring system, we can use the following formula:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position at time t, A is the amplitude of the oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω). We can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass.\n\nω = sqrt(40 N/m / 5 kg) = sqrt(8 s^(-2)) = 2√2 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude (A) and the phase angle (φ). Since the mass is initially displaced 2 cm (0.02 m) from the equilibrium position and released, the initial velocity is 0 m/s. Therefore, the amplitude is equal to the initial displacement:\n\nA = 0.02 m\n\nSince the mass is initially at its maximum displacement, the phase angle (φ) is 0.\n\nNow we can write the equation of motion:\n\nx(t) = 0.02 * cos(2√2 * t)\n\nThe maximum displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position is equal to the amplitude, which is 0.02 m or 2 cm."
