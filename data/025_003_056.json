    "message_2": "To find the intersection of X with the hyperplane z = 1, we substitute z = 1 into the equation defining X:\n\nx^2y + xy(1) + y^3 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx^2y + xy + y^3 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out y from the equation:\n\ny(x^2 + x + y^2) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either y = 0 or x^2 + x + y^2 = 0.\n\nCase 1: y = 0\nIf y = 0, the equation x^2y + xy + y^3 = 0 is automatically satisfied, so any point with y = 0 and z = 1 will be in the intersection. These points form a line in the projective plane, given by the equation y = 0, z = 1.\n\nCase 2: x^2 + x + y^2 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation in x, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1 - 4(y^2)))/2\n\nHowever, since we are working in the projective plane, we need to consider the homogenized version of this equation:\n\nx^2 + xz + y^2 = 0\n\nNow we substitute z = 1:\n\nx^2 + x + y^2 = 0\n\nThe solutions for x are the same as before, but now we have a homogeneous equation in the projective plane. The intersection of X with the hyperplane z = 1 is given by the union of the line y = 0, z = 1 and the curve x^2 + x + y^2 = 0, which is an elliptic curve."
