    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company's objective is to maximize its profit. The profit from Product A is $10 per unit and the profit from Product B is $12 per unit. The company has a total of 500 units of raw material, which is enough to produce either 100 units of Product A or 125 units of Product B. The company has a production capacity of 180 units per day. \n\nWhat is the optimal production plan for the manufacturing company to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 10x + 12y\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. Raw material constraint: x + (125/100)y ≤ 500\n2. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 180\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints.\n\n1. x + (5/4)y ≤ 500\n   y ≥ (-4/5)x + 400\n\n2. x + y ≤ 180\n   y ≤ -x + 180\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's the area enclosed by the lines y = (-4/5)x + 400, y = -x + 180, and y = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the corner points of the feasible region:\nA. Intersection of y = (-4/5)x + 400 and y = -x + 180:\n   (-4/5)x + 400 = -x + 180\n   x = 100, y = 80\n\nB. Intersection of y = -x + 180 and y = 0:\n   y = -x + 180\n   x = 180, y = 0\n\nC. Intersection of y = (-4/5)x + 400 and y = 0:\n   y = (-4/5)x + 400\n   x = 125, y = 0\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\nA. Profit(100, 80) = 10(100) + 12(80) = 1000 + 960 = 1960\nB. Profit(180, 0) = 10(180) + 12(0) = 1800 + 0 = 1800\nC. Profit(125, 0) = 10(125) + 12(0) = 1250 + 0 = 1250\n\nThe maximum profit is $1960 when producing 100 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B."
