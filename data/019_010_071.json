    "message_2": "In linear logic, the formula (A → B) ⊗ (B → C) ⊢ (A → C) can be interpreted as follows:\n\nIf A can be transformed into B, and B can be transformed into C, then A can be transformed into C.\n\nGiven A = 4, B = 2, and C = 8, we can check if the transformations are possible.\n\n1. A → B: Since A = 4 and B = 2, we can transform A into B by dividing A by 2. (4 / 2 = 2)\n\n2. B → C: Since B = 2 and C = 8, we can transform B into C by multiplying B by 4. (2 * 4 = 8)\n\n3. A → C: Since A = 4 and C = 8, we can transform A into C by multiplying A by 2. (4 * 2 = 8)\n\nThus, the given formula holds true for A = 4, B = 2, and C = 8."
