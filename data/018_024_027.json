Show that the symmetric difference operator is not distributive over complement by demonstrating that (A△B)ᶜ is not equal to Aᶜ △ Bᶜ.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference, denoted as A△B, consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA△B = {2, 4, 8, 10, 3, 9} (6 is excluded since it is in both A and B)\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A△B, denoted as (A△B)ᶜ. The complement of a set consists of all elements that are not in the set. Assuming the universal set U contains all integers from 1 to 10, we have:\n\n(A△B)ᶜ = {1, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the complement of A and B individually:\n\nAᶜ = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (all elements in U that are not in A)\nBᶜ = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10} (all elements in U that are not in B)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of Aᶜ and Bᶜ:\n\nAᶜ△Bᶜ = {2, 4, 8, 10, 3, 9} (1, 5, and 7 are excluded since they are in both Aᶜ and Bᶜ)\n\nComparing (A△B)ᶜ and Aᶜ△Bᶜ, we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A△B)ᶜ = {1, 5, 6, 7}\nAᶜ△Bᶜ = {2, 4, 8, 10, 3, 9}\n\nSince (A△B)ᶜ is not equal to Aᶜ△Bᶜ, we can conclude that the symmetric difference operator is not distributive over complement."
