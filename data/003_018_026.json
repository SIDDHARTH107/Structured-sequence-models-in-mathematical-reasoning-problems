    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the given function, we'll apply the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of f(x) = 5sin(2x) - 3cos(3x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [5sin(2x)] - d/dx [3cos(3x)]\n\nFor the first term, the outer function is 5sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x.\nThe derivative of the outer function is d(5sin(u))/du = 5cos(u), and the derivative of the inner function is du/dx = 2.\n\nFor the second term, the outer function is -3cos(u) and the inner function is u = 3x.\nThe derivative of the outer function is d(-3cos(u))/du = 3sin(u), and the derivative of the inner function is du/dx = 3.\n\nNow, we'll apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = (5cos(2x))(2) - (3sin(3x))(3)\nf'(x) = 10cos(2x) - 9sin(3x)\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = 10cos(2(π/4)) - 9sin(3(π/4))\nf'(π/4) = 10cos(π/2) - 9sin(3π/4)\nf'(π/4) = 10(0) - 9(√2/2)\nf'(π/4) = -9(√2/2)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 5sin(2x) - 3cos(3x) at x = π/4 is -9(√2/2)."
