    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (the four smaller squares at the corners and the central one), and the scaling factor is 1/3 (since each line segment in the construction is 1/3 the length of the previous one).\n\nSo, plugging the values into the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(1/3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a length of each line segment of 1/3 is approximately 1.46497."
