    "message_2": "To find the total length of the fence needed to surround the garden, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 12 meters and the width is 8 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (12 + 8)\nPerimeter = 2 * 20\nPerimeter = 40 meters\n\nSo, the total length of the fence needed to surround the garden is 40 meters."
