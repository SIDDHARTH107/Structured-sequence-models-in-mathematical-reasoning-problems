    "message_1": "A communications engineer is designing a wireless communication system with a carrier wave of frequency 10 GHz. The transmitter of this system emits a signal with a square pulse of width 0.1 microseconds. Determine the bandwidth of the signal using Fourier transform analysis.",
    "message_2": "To determine the bandwidth of the signal, we need to analyze the frequency components of the square pulse. The Fourier transform of a square pulse is a sinc function. The sinc function has its first null (zero crossing) at a frequency equal to the inverse of the pulse width.\n\nPulse width (τ) = 0.1 microseconds = 0.1 * 10^(-6) seconds\n\nFirst null frequency (f_null) = 1 / τ = 1 / (0.1 * 10^(-6)) = 10^7 Hz = 10 MHz\n\nThe first null frequency represents the main lobe of the sinc function, which contains most of the signal's energy. Therefore, the bandwidth of the signal can be approximated as twice the first null frequency.\n\nBandwidth (BW) ≈ 2 * f_null = 2 * 10 MHz = 20 MHz\n\nSo, the bandwidth of the signal is approximately 20 MHz."
