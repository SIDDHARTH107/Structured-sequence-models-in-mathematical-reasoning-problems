    "message_1": "Consider the two-dimensional torus $T^2$, i.e., a doughnut-like object with a hole in the middle. Suppose we impose a Morse function $f:T^2\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ that has exactly two critical points: one minimum and one maximum, with critical values $f(p_1)=0$ and $f(p_2)=1$, respectively. \n\nCalculate the Morse homology of $T^2$ so that it shows the homology groups $H_k(T^2)$ for $k=0,1,2$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology of $T^2$, we need to consider the critical points of the Morse function $f$ and their indices. In this case, we have two critical points: $p_1$ with index 0 (minimum) and $p_2$ with index 2 (maximum).\n\nWe will use the Morse complex to compute the homology groups. The Morse complex is a chain complex $(C_*, \\partial_*)$ where $C_k$ is the free abelian group generated by the critical points of index $k$, and $\\partial_k$ is the boundary operator.\n\nIn our case, the Morse complex is given by:\n\n$C_0 = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle p_1 \\rangle$\n\n$C_1 = 0$\n\n$C_2 = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle p_2 \\rangle$\n\nSince there are no critical points of index 1, the boundary operator $\\partial_1$ is trivially zero. The boundary operator $\\partial_2$ is also zero because there are no critical points of index 1 for it to map to.\n\nNow we can compute the homology groups $H_k(T^2)$ as the kernel of $\\partial_k$ modulo the image of $\\partial_{k+1}$:\n\n$H_0(T^2) = \\text{ker}(\\partial_0) / \\text{im}(\\partial_1) = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle p_1 \\rangle / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$H_1(T^2) = \\text{ker}(\\partial_1) / \\text{im}(\\partial_2) = 0 / 0 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$H_2(T^2) = \\text{ker}(\\partial_2) / \\text{im}(\\partial_3) = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle p_2 \\rangle / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nSo the Morse homology groups of $T^2$ are:\n\n$H_0(T^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$H_1(T^2) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$H_2(T^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$"
