    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we need to find the angle opposite the shortest side, which is 7. Let's call this angle A, and the sides opposite angles B and C are 12 and 15, respectively. We can use the Law of Cosines to find angle A.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states: c² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have:\n7² = 12² + 15² - 2 * 12 * 15 * cos(A)\n\n49 = 144 + 225 - 360 * cos(A)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(A):\ncos(A) = (369 - 49) / 360\ncos(A) = 320 / 360\n\nNow, we can find the angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\nA = arccos(320 / 360)\n\nA ≈ 26.4°\n\nSo, the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 26.4°."
