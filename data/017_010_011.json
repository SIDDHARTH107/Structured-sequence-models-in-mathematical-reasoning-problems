    "message_2": "To prove that G must have either 5 elements of order 2 or 10 elements of order 2, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of an element divides the order of the group.\n2. If the order of an element is 2, then it is its own inverse.\n\nLet's consider the elements of G. There must be an identity element, which we will denote as e. Since the order of e is 1, it cannot be one of the elements of order 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining 9 elements. If an element has order 10, then it generates the entire group, and G would be a cyclic group. In this case, there would be no elements of order 2, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, there must be no elements of order 10.\n\nThe only other possibility for the order of an element in G is 2 or 5, due to fact 1. If there is an element of order 5, then there must be 4 elements of order 5 (since the order of a cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order 5 is 5). In this case, there are 5 remaining elements, and they must all have order 2, since there are no elements of order 10. So, we have 5 elements of order 2 in this case.\n\nIf there are no elements of order 5, then all the remaining 9 elements must have order 2. In this case, we have 10 elements of order 2, including the identity element.\n\nNow, let's determine which of the three groups G must be isomorphic to:\n\n1. C10: This is a cyclic group of order 10. It has an element of order 10, which generates the entire group. As we discussed earlier, this case contradicts our assumption, so G cannot be isomorphic to C10.\n\n2. D5: This is the dihedral group of order 10, which is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. It has 5 elements of order 2 (the reflections) and 4 elements of order 5 (the rotations). This group satisfies our assumption, so G could be isomorphic to D5.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10: There is no non-abelian group of order 10. The only two groups of order 10 are C10 and D5.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D5."
