    "message_2": "The fundamental group π1(X, x0) of a topological space X with basepoint x0 is a group that describes the loops in X based at x0, up to homotopy equivalence. In the case of the unit circle S1, we can compute the fundamental group as follows:\n\nConsider a loop in S1 based at x0. We can represent this loop as a continuous map f: [0, 1] → S1, with f(0) = f(1) = x0. Two loops are considered homotopic if there exists a continuous deformation between them, keeping the basepoint fixed.\n\nNow, let's consider the winding number of a loop around the circle. The winding number is an integer that represents the number of times the loop winds around the circle, with positive values for counterclockwise winding and negative values for clockwise winding.\n\nWe can define a homomorphism φ: π1(S1, x0) → ℤ by sending a loop to its winding number. This homomorphism is well-defined, as homotopic loops have the same winding number. Moreover, φ is surjective, as for any integer n, we can construct a loop with winding number n by going around the circle n times.\n\nTo show that φ is injective, suppose that two loops f and g have the same winding number. Then, we can construct a homotopy between f and g by continuously deforming one loop into the other, keeping the basepoint fixed. This shows that f and g are homotopic, and thus φ is injective.\n\nSince φ is both surjective and injective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, the fundamental group π1(S1, x0) is isomorphic to the group of integers ℤ. In other words, π1(S1, x0) ≅ ℤ."
