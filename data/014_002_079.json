Alice's secret number is a=3 while Bob's secret number is b=5. What is the shared secret key that they will use for encryption and decryption?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = α^a mod p, where α is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = α^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B.\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key as K = B^a mod p.\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key as K = A^b mod p.\n\nNow let's calculate the shared secret key using the given values:\n\n1. Alice computes A = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8.\n2. Bob computes B = 2^5 mod 11 = 32 mod 11 = 10.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B (Alice has A=8 and B=10, Bob has A=8 and B=10).\n4. Alice computes K = 10^3 mod 11 = 1000 mod 11 = 1.\n5. Bob computes K = 8^5 mod 11 = 32768 mod 11 = 1.\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for encryption and decryption is K = 1."
