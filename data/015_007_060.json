    "message_2": "The logistic map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the population at time n, and r is a parameter that controls the growth rate.\n\nA period-doubling bifurcation occurs when the system transitions from one stable periodic behavior to another with twice the period. The first period-doubling bifurcation point for the logistic map occurs when the system transitions from a stable fixed point to a stable 2-cycle.\n\nTo find the first period-doubling bifurcation point, we need to find the value of x(n) for which the system transitions from a stable fixed point to a stable 2-cycle. To do this, we first find the fixed point x* by setting x(n+1) = x(n):\n\nx* = r * x* * (1 - x*)\n\nSolving for x*:\n\nx* = 1 - 1/r\n\nNow, we need to find the stability of this fixed point by calculating the derivative of the logistic map with respect to x(n) and evaluating it at x*:\n\nd(x(n+1))/d(x(n)) = r - 2 * r * x(n)\n\nAt the fixed point x*:\n\nd(x*)/d(x(n)) = r - 2 * r * (1 - 1/r) = r - 2 * r * (r - 1)/r = r - 2 * (r - 1)\n\nFor a period-doubling bifurcation to occur, the stability condition is:\n\n-1 < d(x*)/d(x(n)) < 1\n\nSubstituting the value of r = 3.5:\n\n-1 < 3.5 - 2 * (3.5 - 1) < 1\n\n-1 < 3.5 - 5 < 1\n\n-1 < -1.5 < 1\n\nThis inequality is not satisfied, which means that the logistic map with r = 3.5 does not exhibit a period-doubling bifurcation at the first fixed point. Instead, the system directly transitions to a chaotic behavior for r = 3.5."
