Specifically, we can use the product of powers property and the quotient of powers property. \n\nProduct of powers property: $a^{m} \\times a^{n} = a^{m+n}$\n\nQuotient of powers property: $\\frac{a^{m}}{a^{n}} = a^{m-n}$\n\nApplying the product of powers property to the expression:\n\n$2^4 \\times 2^6 = 2^{4+6} = 2^{10}$\n\nNow applying the quotient of powers property:\n\n$\\frac{2^{10}}{2^2} = 2^{10-2} = 2^8$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n$2^8$"
