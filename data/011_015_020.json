    "message_2": "Yes, it is guaranteed that in a party of 6 people, there are at least 3 people who know each other or at least 3 people who don't know each other. This can be proven using the Pigeonhole Principle and the concept of Ramsey Theory.\n\nConsider one person in the party, let's call them Person A. There are 5 other people in the party, and Person A either knows or doesn't know each of them. If Person A knows at least 3 people, then either these 3 people know each other (forming a group of 3 who know each other), or they don't know each other (forming a group of 3 who don't know each other).\n\nIf Person A doesn't know at least 3 people, then we have a similar situation. Either these 3 people know each other (forming a group of 3 who know each other), or they don't know each other (forming a group of 3 who don't know each other).\n\nIn either case, it is guaranteed that there are at least 3 people who know each other or at least 3 people who don't know each other in a party of 6 people."
