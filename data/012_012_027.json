    "message_1": "What is the girth of a graph G that has 10 vertices and 15 edges?",
    "message_2": "The girth of a graph G is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth, we need to analyze the structure of the graph. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the girth of the graph G just by knowing the number of vertices and edges. We need more information about the connections between the vertices to find the girth."
