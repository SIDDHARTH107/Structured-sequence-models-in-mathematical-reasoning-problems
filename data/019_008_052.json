    "message_1": "Sure, here's a fuzzy logic problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose a person's satisfaction with their job can be rated on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means completely dissatisfied and 10 means completely satisfied. Let's say that someone is considering leaving their job if their satisfaction falls below 5.5. Using fuzzy logic, determine the degree to which someone who rates their job satisfaction as a 4.8 should consider leaving their job.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using fuzzy logic, we need to define a membership function that represents the degree of truth for the statement \"a person should consider leaving their job.\" We can define this function as a linear function with the following properties:\n\n1. If the job satisfaction is 5.5 or higher, the membership function value is 0, meaning the person should not consider leaving their job.\n2. If the job satisfaction is 0, the membership function value is 1, meaning the person should definitely consider leaving their job.\n\nWe can define the membership function as:\n\nμ(x) = (5.5 - x) / 5.5, for 0 <= x <= 5.5\nμ(x) = 0, for 5.5 < x <= 10\n\nNow, we can calculate the degree to which someone with a job satisfaction of 4.8 should consider leaving their job:\n\nμ(4.8) = (5.5 - 4.8) / 5.5 ≈ 0.1273\n\nSo, the degree to which someone with a job satisfaction of 4.8 should consider leaving their job is approximately 0.1273, or 12.73%."
