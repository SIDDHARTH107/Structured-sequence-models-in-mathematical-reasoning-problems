    "message_1": "Consider a closed surface with a Morse-Smale complex containing 6 critical points. Let the indices of the critical points be -2,-1,0,1,2, and 3. If the number of descending manifolds is 3 and the number of ascending manifolds is 4, what is the unit Euler characteristic of the surface?",
    "message_2": "The given information about the indices of the critical points is not valid for a Morse-Smale complex on a closed surface. In a Morse-Smale complex, the indices of the critical points must be non-negative integers. The indices represent the dimensions of the unstable manifolds of the critical points, and negative dimensions do not make sense in this context.\n\nPlease provide valid information about the indices of the critical points, and I will be happy to help you compute the Euler characteristic of the surface."
