    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a student who passed the exams, we need to divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students.\n\nProbability = (Number of students who passed) / (Total number of students)\n\nProbability = 350 / 500\n\nProbability = 0.7 or 70%\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a student who passed the exams is 70%."
