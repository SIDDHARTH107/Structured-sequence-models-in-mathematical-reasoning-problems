    "message_2": "The smallest number of people you need in a party to guarantee that either there are 3 people who all know each other or there are 3 people who all do not know each other is 6 people. This problem is known as the Friendship Theorem or the Ramsey number R(3,3).\n\nHere's a simple explanation:\n\nConsider a person A in the party. There are 5 other people, and A either knows or does not know each of them. If A knows at least 3 of them, let's say B, C, and D, then either B, C, and D all know each other (forming a group of 3 who know each other) or at least two of them do not know each other (forming a group of 3 who do not know each other, including A).\n\nIf A does not know at least 3 of them, let's say E, F, and G, then either E, F, and G all do not know each other (forming a group of 3 who do not know each other) or at least two of them know each other (forming a group of 3 who know each other, including A).\n\nIn either case, with 6 people, you are guaranteed to have either 3 people who all know each other or 3 people who all do not know each other."
