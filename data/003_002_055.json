    "message_2": "We are given a right triangle with a 30-degree angle and the length of the side opposite to that angle (4 cm). We can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the other sides and then calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 30-degree angle.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. Since the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 4 cm, we can find the other sides as follows:\n\n1. Side opposite the 30-degree angle (shortest side): 4 cm\n2. Side opposite the 60-degree angle (middle side): 4√3 cm\n3. Hypotenuse (longest side): 8 cm\n\nNow we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 30-degree angle:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of 30 degrees:\nsin(30) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 4 cm / 8 cm = 1/2\n\n2. Cosine (cos) of 30 degrees:\ncos(30) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = 4√3 cm / 8 cm = √3/2\n\n3. Tangent (tan) of 30 degrees:\ntan(30) = opposite side / adjacent side = 4 cm / 4√3 cm = 1/√3 = √3/3\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 30-degree angle in the triangle are 1/2, √3/2, and √3/3, respectively."
