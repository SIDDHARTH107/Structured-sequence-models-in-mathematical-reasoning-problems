    "message_2": "The Morse Inequalities relate the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the topology of the manifold, specifically its homology groups. In the case of a surface with Euler characteristic equal to 2, we are dealing with a sphere (since the Euler characteristic of a sphere is 2).\n\nLet M be a smooth, compact, and connected surface (in this case, a sphere) and f: M → ℝ be a smooth function on M. Let m_k denote the number of critical points of index k, and let b_k denote the k-th Betti number of M (the rank of the k-th homology group H_k(M)). The Morse Inequalities state that:\n\nm_k ≥ b_k for all k, and\n\nΣ(-1)^k m_k = Σ(-1)^k b_k = χ(M),\n\nwhere χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of M.\n\nFor a sphere, we have b_0 = 1, b_1 = 0, and b_2 = 1, since it has one connected component, no nontrivial loops, and one 2-dimensional \"hole\" (the interior of the sphere). Thus, the Morse Inequalities for a sphere are:\n\nm_0 ≥ 1,\nm_1 ≥ 0,\nm_2 ≥ 1.\n\nNow, let's compute the Euler characteristic using the Morse Inequalities:\n\nχ(M) = Σ(-1)^k m_k = m_0 - m_1 + m_2.\n\nSince we know χ(M) = 2 for a sphere, we have:\n\n2 = m_0 - m_1 + m_2.\n\nUsing the inequalities above, we can deduce that m_0 = 1, m_1 = 0, and m_2 = 1. This means that there is at least one critical point of index 0 (minimum), no critical points of index 1 (saddle points), and at least one critical point of index 2 (maximum) on a sphere.\n\nTo prove this using Morse theory, we can consider a height function on the sphere. For example, let f: M → ℝ be the height function given by f(x, y, z) = z, where (x, y, z) are the coordinates of a point on the sphere. The critical points of f are the points where the gradient of f vanishes, i.e., ∇f = 0. In this case, the critical points are the north and south poles of the sphere, which are a minimum and a maximum, respectively. There are no saddle points for this height function. Thus, we have shown that the Morse Inequalities hold for a sphere using Morse theory."
