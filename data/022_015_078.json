    "message_1": "A math student studying complex analysis needs to find the reflection of the given point in the line of reflection using Schwarz reflection principle. \n\nThe point is z = 3 - 4i and the line of reflection is the real axis. Find the reflection of the given point in the line of reflection by applying the Schwarz Reflection Principle.",
    "message_2": "The Schwarz Reflection Principle states that if a function is analytic in a region and continuous up to the boundary, then its reflection across the boundary is also analytic. In this case, we are reflecting the point z = 3 - 4i across the real axis (the boundary).\n\nTo find the reflection of a complex number across the real axis, we simply need to negate the imaginary part of the complex number while keeping the real part the same.\n\nGiven point z = 3 - 4i, the reflection of z across the real axis will be:\n\nz' = 3 + 4i\n\nSo, the reflection of the point z = 3 - 4i across the real axis is z' = 3 + 4i."
