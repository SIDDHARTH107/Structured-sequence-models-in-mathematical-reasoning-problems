    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we need to find the second derivative of the function and then find the points where the second derivative is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the points where the second derivative is equal to zero:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is one inflection point at x = 2. To find the y-coordinate of the inflection point, we plug the x-value back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) + 2\nf(2) = 8 - 24 + 18 + 2\nf(2) = 4\n\nThus, the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 is at (2, 4)."
