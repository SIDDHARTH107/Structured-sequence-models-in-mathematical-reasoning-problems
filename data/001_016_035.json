    "message_2": "To simplify the expression $3^4 \\cdot 3^2$, we use the rule of exponents that states when multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base, we can add the exponents. In this case, the base is 3 and the exponents are 4 and 2.\n\nSo, $3^4 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^{(4+2)} = 3^6$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of $3^6$:\n\n$3^6 = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 729$\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is $3^6 = 729$."
