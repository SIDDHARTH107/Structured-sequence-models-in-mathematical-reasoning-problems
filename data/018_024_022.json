    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the two sets A and B. The symmetric difference (A Δ B) consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA Δ B = {2, 11}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of set A, denoted as A'. A' consists of all elements that are not in A. Since we are not given a universal set, we cannot determine the exact elements in A'. However, we can still proceed with the proof.\n\nLet's find (A Δ B) ∆ A':\n\n(A Δ B) ∆ A' = {2, 11} ∆ A'\n\nNow, let's find A ∆ A':\n\nA ∆ A' consists of elements that are in either A or A', but not in both.
