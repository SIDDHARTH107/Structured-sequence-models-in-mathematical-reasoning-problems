    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected person in this city is over 65 and has the disease, we can multiply the probability of each event occurring.\n\nProbability of being over 65: 25% (0.25)\nProbability of having the disease given they are over 65: 18% (0.18)\n\nProbability of both events occurring: 0.25 * 0.18 = 0.045\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person in this city is over 65 and has the disease is 4.5%."
