The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetric difference of (A × B) and A. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\n(A × B) △ A = {elements in (A × B) but not in A} ∪ {elements in A but not in (A × B)}\n\nElements in (A × B) but not in A:\n{(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nElements in A but not in (A × B):\n{1, 2, 3}\n\nSo, (A × B) △ A = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), 1, 2, 3}"
