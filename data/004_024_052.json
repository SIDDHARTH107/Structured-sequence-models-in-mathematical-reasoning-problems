    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx at the point (3,4), we first need to differentiate the given equation implicitly with respect to x.\n\nGiven equation: x² + y² = 25\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\nd/dx(x²) + d/dx(y²) = d/dx(25)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\n\nDivide both sides by 2y:\ndy/dx = -2x / 2y\n\nSimplify:\ndy/dx = -x / y\n\nNow, we can plug in the point (3,4) to find the value of dy/dx:\ndy/dx = -3 / 4\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx at the point (3,4) is -3/4."
