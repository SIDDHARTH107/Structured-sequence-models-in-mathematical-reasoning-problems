Compute the cup product of the cohomology classes [Y] and [X], where [Y] and [X] denote the fundamental classes of Y and X, respectively, with coefficients in the field Z/2Z.",
    "message_2": "To compute the cup product of the cohomology classes [Y] and [X], we first need to understand the cohomology ring structure of X and Y. Since Y is a 2-dimensional sphere, its cohomology ring is given by:\n\nH^*(Y; Z/2Z) = (Z/2Z)[y]/(y^3),\n\nwhere y is a generator of H^2(Y; Z/2Z) and |y| = 2 (i.e., y has degree 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the cohomology ring of X. Since X is a 4-dimensional smooth manifold, its cohomology ring has the form:\n\nH^*(X; Z/2Z) = (Z/2Z)[x]/(x^5),\n\nwhere x is a generator of H^4(X; Z/2Z) and |x| = 4.\n\nNow, we need to compute the cup product [Y] ∪ [X]. Since [Y] is a generator of H^2(Y; Z/2Z) and [X] is a generator of H^4(X; Z/2Z), their cup product will be a generator of H^6(X; Z/2Z). However, since X is a 4-dimensional manifold, its cohomology groups vanish in degrees greater than 4. Therefore, the cup product [Y] ∪ [X] = 0."
