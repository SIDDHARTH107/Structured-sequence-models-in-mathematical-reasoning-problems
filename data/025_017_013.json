    "message_2": "To show that the sections of L^m for m sufficiently large generate the algebra of regular functions on X, we will use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension n over an algebraically closed field k, and let L be a very ample line bundle on X. If m is sufficiently large, then the global sections of L^m generate the algebra of regular functions on X.\n\nProof: We will prove this theorem by induction on the dimension n of X.\n\nBase case (n = 0): If X is a point, then the only regular functions on X are constants, and any line bundle on X is trivial. Thus, the global sections of L^m generate the algebra of regular functions on X for any m.\n\nInductive step: Assume the theorem holds for varieties of dimension n - 1. Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension n over an algebraically closed field k, and let L be a very ample line bundle on X. We want to show that the sections of L^m for m sufficiently large generate the algebra of regular functions on X.\n\nSince X is not ruled, by Bertini's theorem, there exists a smooth hyperplane section Y of X with respect to L. Then Y is a smooth projective variety of dimension n - 1, and the restriction of L to Y is a very ample line bundle on Y. By the induction hypothesis, the sections of L^m|_Y for m sufficiently large generate the algebra of regular functions on Y.\n\nNow, consider the short exact sequence of sheaves on X:\n\n0 → O_X(-Y) → O_X → O_Y → 0\n\nTensoring this sequence with L^m, we get:\n\n0 → L^m(-Y) → L^m → L^m|_Y → 0\n\nTaking global sections, we obtain the following exact sequence:\n\n0 → H^0(X, L^m(-Y)) → H^0(X, L^m) → H^0(Y, L^m|_Y)\n\nSince the sections of L^m|_Y for m sufficiently large generate the algebra of regular functions on Y, it suffices to show that the sections of L^m(-Y) for m sufficiently large generate the algebra of regular functions on X that vanish along Y.\n\nBy Serre's vanishing theorem, there exists an integer M such that for all m ≥ M, we have H^1(X, L^m(-Y)) = 0. Then, by the long exact sequence in cohomology associated to the short exact sequence of sheaves, we have:\n\nH^0(X, L^m(-Y)) → H^0(X, L^m) → H^0(Y, L^m|_Y) → H^1(X, L^m(-Y)) = 0\n\nThis implies that the map H^0(X, L^m(-Y)) → H^0(X, L^m) is surjective for m ≥ M. Therefore, the sections of L^m(-Y) for m sufficiently large generate the algebra of regular functions on X that vanish along Y.\n\nCombining the results for L^m|_Y and L^m(-Y), we conclude that the sections of L^m for m sufficiently large generate the algebra of regular functions on X. This completes the induction step and the proof of the theorem."
