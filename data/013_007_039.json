    "message_1": "Consider a community of 10 farmers sharing a common pasture with a capacity of 100 cows. Each farmer can keep up to 20 cows on the pasture. Let's assume that the cost of maintaining one cow on the pasture is 50 dollars per year, and the revenue generated by each cow is 100 dollars per year. If each farmer maximizes their own profit and disregards the common interest, how many cows will be kept on the pasture, and what will be the resulting profit and cost to the community? How much will each farmer gain or lose?",
    "message_2": "If each farmer maximizes their own profit and disregards the common interest, they will each keep the maximum number of cows allowed, which is 20 cows per farmer. With 10 farmers, this means there will be a total of 10 * 20 = 200 cows on the pasture. However, the pasture can only support 100 cows.\n\nSince the pasture is over its capacity, we will assume that all 200 cows are kept on the pasture, even though it is not sustainable in the long term.\n\nThe total revenue generated by all the cows will be 200 cows * $100 per cow = $20,000 per year.\n\nThe total cost of maintaining all the cows will be 200 cows * $50 per cow = $10,000 per year.\n\nThe resulting profit for the community will be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000 per year.\n\nSince there are 10 farmers, each farmer will gain an equal share of the profit. So, each farmer will gain $10,000 / 10 = $1,000 per year.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this situation is not sustainable in the long term, as the pasture can only support 100 cows. The farmers would need to find a more sustainable solution to avoid depleting the pasture and potentially losing their source of income."
