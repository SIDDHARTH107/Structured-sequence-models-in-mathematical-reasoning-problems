    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, having the medical condition) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (having the medical condition)\n- n is the number of trials (sample size)\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- p = 0.05 (probability of having the medical condition)\n- n = 200 (sample size)\n- k = 12 (number of people with the medical condition)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k), which is the number of combinations of 200 items taken 12 at a time:\n\nC(200, 12) = 200! / (12! * (200-12)!)\nC(200, 12) = 200! / (12! * 188!)\n\nNow, let's calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):\n\np^k = 0.05^12\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.05)^(200-12) = 0.95^188\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 12) = C(200, 12) * 0.05^12 * 0.95^188\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nP(X = 12) â‰ˆ 0.1093\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 12 people out of the 200 sampled have the medical condition is approximately 0.1093 or 10.93%."
