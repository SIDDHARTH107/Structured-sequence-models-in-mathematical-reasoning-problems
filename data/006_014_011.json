    "message_1": "A certain technological system has a 6% chance of failure in any given year. What is the probability that this system will fail at least once in the next 5 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the system will fail at least once in the next 5 years, we can first find the probability that it will not fail in any of those years, and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nThe probability that the system will not fail in any given year is 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.\n\nThe probability that the system will not fail in 5 consecutive years is (0.94)^5 = 0.734.\n\nNow, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the system will fail at least once in the next 5 years:\n\n1 - 0.734 = 0.266.\n\nSo, the probability that the system will fail at least once in the next 5 years is approximately 26.6%."
