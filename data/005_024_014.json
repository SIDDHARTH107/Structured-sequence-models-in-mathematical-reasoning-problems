    "message_1": "In a certain city, the average income of 50 households is $75,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000. A data mining analysis shows that there are two outliers in the dataset with incomes of $150,000 and $200,000 per year. What is the new average income of the remaining 48 households after excluding the two outliers?",
    "message_2": "To find the new average income of the remaining 48 households after excluding the two outliers, we first need to find the total income of the 50 households, then subtract the incomes of the two outliers, and finally divide the result by 48.\n\n1. Find the total income of the 50 households:\nAverage income = Total income / Number of households\n$75,000 = Total income / 50\nTotal income = $75,000 * 50 = $3,750,000\n\n2. Subtract the incomes of the two outliers:\nTotal income without outliers = Total income - (Outlier 1 + Outlier 2)\nTotal income without outliers = $3,750,000 - ($150,000 + $200,000)\nTotal income without outliers = $3,750,000 - $350,000 = $3,400,000\n\n3. Find the new average income of the remaining 48 households:\nNew average income = Total income without outliers / Number of remaining households\nNew average income = $3,400,000 / 48\nNew average income = $70,833.33\n\nSo, the new average income of the remaining 48 households after excluding the two outliers is $70,833.33."
