    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the potential V(x, y) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y, i.e., V(x, y) = X(x)Y(y).\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the Laplace's equation:\n\n∇²V = ∇²(X(x)Y(y)) = 0\n\nTaking the second derivative with respect to x and y, we get:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -k²:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -k²\nY''(y)/Y(y) = k²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) = -k²X(x)\nY''(y) = k²Y(y)\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx)\nY(y) = C*cosh(ky) + D*sinh(ky)\n\nNow, let's apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. V(0, y) = 0 => X(0)Y(y) = 0 => X(0) = 0 => A = 0\n2. V(1, y) = 0 => X(1)Y(y) = 0 => X(1) = 0 => B*sin(k) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), sin(k) = 0. This implies that k = nπ, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, the solution for X(x) becomes:\n\nX(x) = B_n*sin(nπx)\n\nNow, let's apply the boundary condition for the top edge:\n\n3. V(x, 1) = 100V => X(x)Y(1) = 100V => Y(1) = 100V/B_n\n\nThe solution for Y(y) becomes:\n\nY(y) = C_n*cosh(nπy) + 100V/B_n*sinh(nπy)\n\nNow, let's apply the boundary condition for the bottom edge:\n\n4. V(x, 0) = 0 => X(x)Y(0) = 0 => Y(0) = 0 => C_n = 0\n\nSo, the solution for Y(y) is:\n\nY(y) = 100V/B_n*sinh(nπy)\n\nNow, the general solution for V(x, y) is:\n\nV(x, y) = Σ [B_n*sin(nπx)*100V/B_n*sinh(nπy)]\n\nSince V(x, 1) = 100V for 0 <= x <= 1, we can use the Fourier sine series to find the coefficients B_n:\n\n100V = Σ [B_n*sin(nπx)]\n\nComparing this to the Fourier sine series formula, we get:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[0 to L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFor our problem, f(x) = 100V and L = 1:\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫[0 to 1] 100V * sin(nπx) dx\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nB_n = (200V/πn) * (1 - cos(nπ))\n\nNow, the final solution for V(x, y) is:\n\nV(x, y) = Σ [(200V/πn) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(nπx) * sinh(nπy)]\n\nThis is the potential V inside the region."
