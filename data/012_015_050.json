    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components in a graph G with 10 vertices and 12 edges, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of connected components = Number of vertices - Number of edges + Number of cycles\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of cycles in the graph. Since we don't have information about the specific structure of the graph, we can't determine the exact number of cycles. However, we can still provide a range for the number of connected components based on the minimum and maximum number of cycles.\n\nMinimum number of cycles: Let's assume the graph has no cycles (i.e., it's a tree). In this case, the formula becomes:\n\nNumber of connected components = 10 - 12 + 0 = -2\n\nHowever, the number of connected components cannot be negative. Since a tree with 10 vertices has 9 edges, having 12 edges means there must be at least one cycle in the graph. So, the minimum number of connected components is 1.\n\nMaximum number of cycles: Let's assume the graph has the maximum possible number of cycles. Since the graph has 10 vertices and 12 edges, it can have at most 3 cycles (as a tree with 10 vertices has 9 edges, and adding 3 edges to a tree will create 3 cycles). In this case, the formula becomes:\n\nNumber of connected components = 10 - 12 + 3 = 1\n\nTherefore, the number of connected components in the graph G with 10 vertices and 12 edges is 1."
