    "message_2": "As of now, there is no known smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, because Goldbach's conjecture remains unproven. The conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Although it has been tested extensively for large even numbers and found to be true, a general proof or counterexample has not been discovered yet."
