    "message_1": "A triangle has sides a = 10 cm, b = 12 cm, and c unknown. If the angle opposite to side a is 60 degrees, use the law of cosines to find the length of side c.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side c. The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and C are the given side lengths and angle. In this case, a = 10 cm, b = 12 cm, and C = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 degrees * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nc² = (10 cm)² + (12 cm)² - 2 * (10 cm) * (12 cm) * cos(π / 3)\n\nc² = 100 + 144 - 240 * cos(π / 3)\n\ncos(π / 3) = 1/2, so:\n\nc² = 100 + 144 - 240 * (1/2)\n\nc² = 100 + 144 - 120\n\nc² = 244 - 120\n\nc² = 124\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √124 ≈ 11.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of side c is approximately 11.14 cm."
