    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic function y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = 7. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\nx = -(-5) / 2(2) = 5 / 4\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(5/4)^2 - 5(5/4) + 7\n\ny = 2(25/16) - (25/4) + 7\ny = 50/16 - 100/16 + 112/16\ny = 62/16\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic function is (5/4, 62/16).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = 5/4\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 - 5(0) + 7\ny = 7\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 7).\n\nIn summary, the vertex of the quadratic function is (5/4, 62/16), the axis of symmetry is x = 5/4, and the y-intercept is (0, 7)."
