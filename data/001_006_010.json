    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 5x - 3, we need to find the vertex, x-intercepts, and y-intercepts.\n\n1. Vertex:\nThe vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c can be found using the formula: h = -b / 2a, where h is the x-coordinate of the vertex, and a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n\nIn our case, a = 2 and b = 5. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex (h) is:\n\nh = -5 / (2 * 2) = -5 / 4\n\nNow, we need to find the y-coordinate of the vertex (k). We can do this by substituting the x-coordinate (h) back into the equation:\n\nk = 2(-5/4)^2 + 5(-5/4) - 3\n\nk = 2(25/16) - (25/4) - 3\nk = 50/16 - 100/16 - 48/16\nk = (-98/16)\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (-5/4, -98/16).\n\n2. x-intercepts:\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x^2 + 5x - 3\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2))\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4\nx = (-5 ± √49) / 4\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 4\n\nSo, we have two x-intercepts:\n\nx1 = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\nx2 = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12 / 4 = -3\n\nThe x-intercepts are (1/2, 0) and (-3, 0).\n\n3. y-intercept:\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 + 5(0) - 3\ny = -3\n\nThe y-intercept is (0, -3).\n\nNow we have all the necessary information to graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 5x - 3:\n\n- Vertex: (-5/4, -98/16)\n- x-intercepts: (1/2, 0) and (-3, 0)\n- y-intercept: (0, -3)"
