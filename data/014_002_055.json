    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, we first need to compute Alice's and Bob's public keys.\n\nAlice's public key (A) is calculated as follows:\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 3^5 mod 23\nA = 243 mod 23\nA = 10\n\nBob's public key (B) is calculated as follows:\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 3^7 mod 23\nB = 2187 mod 23\nB = 3\n\nNow, we can compute the shared secret key (S) using Alice's private key and Bob's public key or Bob's private key and Alice's public key. Both methods will give the same result.\n\nUsing Alice's private key and Bob's public key:\nS = B^a mod p\nS = 3^5 mod 23\nS = 243 mod 23\nS = 10\n\nUsing Bob's private key and Alice's public key:\nS = A^b mod p\nS = 10^7 mod 23\nS = 10000000 mod 23\nS = 10\n\nSo, the shared secret key is 10."
