    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nFor a circle with a radius of 7 cm:\n\nC = 2 × π × 7\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 7\nC ≈ 43.98226 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
