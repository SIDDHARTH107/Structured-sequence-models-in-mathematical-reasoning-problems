    "message_1": "Suppose A and B are playing the ultimatum game. A proposes a split of $100 and B must either accept or reject the offer. If B accepts, the split is carried out as proposed. If B rejects, both players receive nothing. What is the range of reasonable offers that A can make to ensure that B accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the ultimatum game, the range of reasonable offers that A can make to ensure that B accepts the offer depends on the rationality and preferences of both players. Assuming both players are rational and prefer more money over less, A should offer a split that is favorable enough for B to accept rather than reject and receive nothing.\n\nThe minimum amount A can offer B is $1, as B would still prefer $1 over receiving nothing. The maximum amount A can offer B is $99, as A would want to keep at least $1 for themselves. Therefore, the range of reasonable offers that A can make to ensure that B accepts the offer is between $1 and $99 for B, with A keeping the remaining amount from the $100."
