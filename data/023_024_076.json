    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier series for the function g(x) = 1, -π < x < π. The Fourier series is given by:\n\ng(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients. Since g(x) is an even function, all the sine terms will be zero. We can find the coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] g(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] g(x) * cos(n * x) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] g(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nFor g(x) = 1, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] 1 dx = (1/π) * [x](-π, π) = 2\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] cos(n * x) dx = (1/π) * [sin(n * x) / n](-π, π) = 0 (since sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer n)\n\nNow, let's find the odd extension of g(x) to obtain f(x). Since g(x) is even, its odd extension is given by:\n\nf(x) = g(x) * sgn(x) = {1, -π < x < 0; -1, 0 < x < π}\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series for f(x) using the coefficients we found for g(x):\n\nf(x) = a_0 * sgn(x) + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) * sgn(x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nSince a_n = 0 for all n, the cosine terms will be zero. The Fourier series for f(x) is then given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nTo find the coefficients b_n, we use the formula:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nFor -π < x < 0, f(x) = 1, and for 0 < x < π, f(x) = -1. So, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] sin(n * x) dx - ∫[0, π] sin(n * x) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-cos(n * x) / n) (-π, 0) + (cos(n * x) / n) (0, π)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1 - cos(n * π)) / n]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n for all integer n, we have:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1 - (-1)^n) / n]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [(1/π) * (1 - (-1)^n) / n * sin(n * x)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x)."
