    "message_2": "A level-3 Menger sponge is constructed by taking a level-2 Menger sponge and applying the same process of removing cubes as was done to create the level-2 sponge from the level-1 sponge. \n\nA level-1 Menger sponge is formed by taking a 3x3x3 cube and removing the center cube and the center cube of each face, which results in 20 cubes remaining.\n\nA level-2 Menger sponge is formed by taking 20 level-1 Menger sponges and removing the corresponding cubes. Since each level-1 sponge has 20 cubes, a level-2 sponge has 20 * 20 = 400 cubes.\n\nFinally, a level-3 Menger sponge is formed by taking 20 level-2 Menger sponges and removing the corresponding cubes. Since each level-2 sponge has 400 cubes, a level-3 sponge has 20 * 400 = 8000 cubes."
