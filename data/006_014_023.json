    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one backup system will be operational, we can first find the probability that all backup systems fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a system failure is 0.1, so the probability of a system being operational is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSince the backup systems operate independently, the probability of all 5 backup systems failing is (0.1)^5 = 0.00001.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one backup system will be operational by subtracting the probability of all systems failing from 1:\n\n1 - 0.00001 = 0.99999\n\nSo, the probability that at least one backup system will be operational if the spacecraft is launched is approximately 0.99999 or 99.999%."
