    "message_2": "The least common multiple (LCM) of 9, 12, and 15 can be found by first finding the prime factors of each number:\n\n9 = 3^2\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n15 = 3 * 5\n\nNow, find the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:\n\n2^2, 3^2, and 5\n\nMultiply these together to get the LCM:\n\n2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180\n\nSo, the least common multiple of 9, 12, and 15 is 180."
