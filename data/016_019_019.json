    "message_2": "The Koch Island fractal construction rule involves replacing each side of the equilateral triangle with a Koch curve. In each iteration, every side of the triangle is divided into three equal parts, and a smaller equilateral triangle is added in the middle part, increasing the number of sides by a factor of 4/3.\n\nLet's denote the initial length of the sides as L0 = 3 cm. After the first iteration, the length of each side will be L1 = (4/3)L0. After the second iteration, the length of each side will be L2 = (4/3)L1, and so on.\n\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of each side will be L4 = (4/3)^4 * L0.\n\nNow, since there are three sides in an equilateral triangle, the total perimeter P4 after the fourth iteration will be:\n\nP4 = 3 * L4 = 3 * (4/3)^4 * L0 = 3 * (256/81) * 3 = (768/81) * 3 = 2304/81 cm â‰ˆ 28.444 cm.\n\nSo, the total length of the perimeter after applying the Koch Island fractal geometric construction rule 4 times is approximately 28.444 cm."
