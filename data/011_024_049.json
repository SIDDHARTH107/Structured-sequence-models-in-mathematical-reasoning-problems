Each warehouse has a different supply capacity and each retailer has a different demand requirement. The costs per unit of transportation between each warehouse and retailer are given below:\n  \n           Retailer 1  Retailer 2  Retailer 3  Retailer 4  Retailer 5\nWarehouse 1       12          16          21          25          11\nWarehouse 2       18          11          14          17          19\nWarehouse 3       23          14          17          27          13\n\nWrite a linear programming problem to determine the optimal transportation schedule for the company. Also, find the minimum transportation cost required to meet the demand of all retailers.",
    "message_2": "Let x_ij be the number of units transported from Warehouse i to Retailer j, where i = 1, 2, 3 and j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nObjective function: Minimize the total transportation cost\nZ = 12x_11 + 16x_12 + 21x_13 + 25x_14 + 11x_15 + 18x_21 + 11x_22 + 14x_23 + 17x_24 + 19x_25 + 23x_31 + 14x_32 + 17x_33 + 27x_34 + 13x_35\n\nConstraints:\n1. Supply constraints for each warehouse (assuming supply capacities are S1, S2, and S3 for warehouses 1, 2, and 3 respectively):\nx_11 + x_12 + x_13 + x_14 + x_15 <= S1\nx_21 + x_22 + x_23 + x_24 + x_25 <= S2\nx_31 + x_32 + x_33 + x_34 + x_35 <= S3\n\n2. Demand constraints for each retailer (assuming demand requirements are D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 for retailers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively):\nx_11 + x_21 + x_31 >= D1\nx_12 + x_22 + x_32 >= D2\nx_13 + x_23 + x_33 >= D3\nx_14 + x_24 + x_34 >= D4\nx_15 + x_25 + x_35 >= D5\n\n3. Non-negativity constraints:\nx_ij >= 0 for all i and j\n\nTo find the minimum transportation cost, you can use a linear programming solver to solve this problem with the given objective function and constraints. The optimal solution will provide the values of x_ij that minimize the total transportation cost while meeting the demand of all retailers."
