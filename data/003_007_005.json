    "message_1": "A triangle has sides with lengths of 5, 7, and x. The angle opposite the side of length 5 measures 60 degrees, and the angle opposite the side of length 7 measures 45 degrees. Find the value of x using the law of cosines.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, with a = 5, b = 7, and c = x. Let's also denote the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively, with A = 60 degrees, B = 45 degrees, and C being the angle opposite to side c.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we can write the equation for side c as:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nFirst, we need to find angle C. We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so:\n\nC = 180 - A - B\nC = 180 - 60 - 45\nC = 75 degrees\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nc^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(75)\nc^2 = 25 + 49 - 70 * cos(75)\n\nNow, we need to find the cosine of 75 degrees. We can use the sum of angles formula for cosine:\n\ncos(75) = cos(45 + 30) = cos(45) * cos(30) - sin(45) * sin(30)\n\ncos(45) = √2 / 2, sin(45) = √2 / 2, cos(30) = √3 / 2, sin(30) = 1 / 2\n\ncos(75) = (√2 / 2) * (√3 / 2) - (√2 / 2) * (1 / 2)\ncos(75) = (√6 + √2) / 4\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nc^2 = 25 + 49 - 70 * ((√6 + √2) / 4)\nc^2 = 74 - 35 * (√6 + √2)\n\nNow, we can find the square root of both sides to find the value of c:\n\nc = √(74 - 35 * (√6 + √2))\n\nThis is the exact value of x. If you want to find the approximate value, you can use a calculator:\n\nc ≈ 3.95"
