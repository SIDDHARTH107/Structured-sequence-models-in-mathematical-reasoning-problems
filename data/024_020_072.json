    "message_1": "Let $S^3$ be the 3-dimensional sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Determine the Hopf map $h:S^3\\rightarrow S^2$ given by $h(x,y,z,w)=(x^2+y^2-z^2-w^2,2(xy+zw),2(xz-yw))$.",
    "message_2": "The Hopf map $h: S^3 \\rightarrow S^2$ is a continuous map from the 3-dimensional sphere to the 2-dimensional sphere. It is given by the formula:\n\n$$h(x, y, z, w) = (x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - w^2, 2(xy + zw), 2(xz - yw)).$$\n\nTo show that this map is well-defined, we need to show that for any point $(x, y, z, w) \\in S^3$, the image $h(x, y, z, w)$ lies on the 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$. In other words, we need to show that the image satisfies the equation:\n\n$$u^2 + v^2 + s^2 = 1,$$\n\nwhere $(u, v, s) = h(x, y, z, w)$. Substituting the expressions for $u, v,$ and $s$ from the Hopf map, we get:\n\n$$(x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - w^2)^2 + (2(xy + zw))^2 + (2(xz - yw))^2 = 1.$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$$x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 + 2x^2z^2 + 2y^2z^2 + z^4 + 2x^2w^2 + 2y^2w^2 + 2z^2w^2 + w^4 - 4x^2z^2 - 4y^2w^2 = 1.$$\n\nNow, recall that $(x, y, z, w) \\in S^3$, so $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1$. Therefore, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:\n\n$$(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2)^2 - 4x^2z^2 - 4y^2w^2 = 1^2 - 4x^2z^2 - 4y^2w^2 = 1.$$\n\nThus, the image of any point $(x, y, z, w) \\in S^3$ under the Hopf map $h$ lies on the 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$, and the map is well-defined.\n\nThe Hopf map is an important example of a non-trivial map between spheres, and it has many interesting properties and applications in mathematics, particularly in algebraic topology and the study of fiber bundles."
