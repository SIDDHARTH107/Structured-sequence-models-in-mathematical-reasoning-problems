    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x-5) = 3, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n(√(2x-5))^2 = 3^2\n\n2x - 5 = 9\n\n2. Add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 14\n\n3. Divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, the solution of the equation √(2x-5) = 3 is x = 7."
