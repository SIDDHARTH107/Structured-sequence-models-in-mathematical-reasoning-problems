    "message_2": "To determine if a point (0.75, 0.1) is outside the Mandelbrot Set, we will use the iterative formula:\n\nZ_(n+1) = Z_n^2 + C\n\nwhere Z_n is a complex number, C is the complex constant (0.75 + 0.1i), and Z_0 = 0.\n\nWe will iterate this formula until the magnitude of Z_n exceeds the escape value of 2 or until we reach the maximum iteration count of 1000.\n\nLet's perform the iterations:\n\n1. Z_1 = (0)^2 + (0.75 + 0.1i) = 0.75 + 0.1i\n2. Z_2 = (0.75 + 0.1i)^2 + (0.75 + 0.1i) = 0.5575 + 0.25i\n3. Z_3 = (0.5575 + 0.25i)^2 + (0.75 + 0.1i) = 1.06000625 + 0.389i\n4. Z_4 = (1.06000625 + 0.389i)^2 + (0.75 + 0.1i) = 1.34793015390625 + 0.8245705i\n\nAt this point, the magnitude of Z_4 is:\n\n|Z_4| = sqrt(1.34793015390625^2 + 0.8245705^2) ≈ 1.589\n\nSince the magnitude of Z_4 is still less than the escape value of 2, we continue:\n\n5. Z_5 = (1.34793015390625 + 0.8245705i)^2 + (0.75 + 0.1i) ≈ 2.239 + 1.974i\n\nNow, the magnitude of Z_5 is:\n\n|Z_5| = sqrt(2.239^2 + 1.974^2) ≈ 2.989\n\nSince the magnitude of Z_5 is greater than the escape value of 2, we can conclude that the point (0.75, 0.1) is outside the Mandelbrot Set.\n\nIt took 5 iterations to confirm that the point (0.75, 0.1) is outside the Mandelbrot Set."
