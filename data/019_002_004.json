    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in predicate logic:\n\n\"All cats are hunters. Max is a cat. Is Max a hunter?\"\n\nSolution: Let H(x) be the predicate \"x is a hunter\" and let C(x) be the predicate \"x is a cat.\" Then the original statement can be represented as: ∀x(C(x) → H(x)). \n\nWe are given that Max is a cat (C(Max)). To determine if Max is a hunter, we can substitute Max for the variable x in the predicate H(x). Thus, H(Max) is the statement \"Max is a hunter.\" \n\nUsing universal instantiation, we can conclude that C(Max) → H(Max) is true. Therefore, we can answer the question by stating that Max is, in fact, a hunter.",
    "message_2": "Yes, Max is a hunter."
