    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given group table to determine some properties of the group G.\n\n1. The identity element e is present, and each element has an inverse (e.g., a has a, b has f, c has h, etc.).\n2. The group is non-abelian, as the table is not symmetric along the diagonal (e.g., ab = d â‰  b = ba).\n3. The order of the group is 24, which has prime factorization 2^3 * 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible isomorphisms:\n\n1. Cyclic group C24: Since G is non-abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to the abelian cyclic group C24.\n\n2. Alternating group A5: A5 has order 5!/2 = 60, which is not equal to the order of G (24). Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A5.\n\n3. One of the five non-abelian groups of order 24: Since G is non-abelian and has order 24, it is possible that G is isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\nTo determine which of the five non-abelian groups of order 24 G is isomorphic to, we can analyze the structure of G further. We can observe that:\n\n1. The element a has order 2, as a^2 = e.\n2. The element b has order 6, as b^6 = e.\n3. The element c has order 4, as c^4 = e.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that G has a subgroup of order 6 (generated by b) and a subgroup of order 4 (generated by c). This structure is consistent with the semidirect product of Z6 and Z4, which is one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the group G is isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24, specifically the semidirect product of Z6 and Z4."
