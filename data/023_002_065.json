Find the Fourier series of f(x), and then determine if it converges pointwise, uniformly, or in mean square, or diverges on the given interval.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 2 - |x| on the interval [-2, 2], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero. We can compute the a_n coefficients using the following formula:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L)] dx, where L is half the period of the function.\n\nIn this case, L = 2. So, we have:\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / 2)] dx, where the integral is taken over the interval [-2, 2].\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral for f(x) = 2 - |x|. We can split the integral into two parts, one for the interval [-2, 0] and the other for the interval [0, 2]:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [∫[-2,0] (2 + x) * cos(n * π * x / 2) dx + ∫[0,2] (2 - x) * cos(n * π * x / 2) dx]\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\n∫[-2,0] (2 + x) * cos(n * π * x / 2) dx = [((4/π^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)) / n^2] * sin(n * π * x / 2) | from -2 to 0\n\n∫[0,2] (2 - x) * cos(n * π * x / 2) dx = [((4/π^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)) / n^2] * sin(n * π * x / 2) | from 0 to 2\n\nAdding these two integrals, we get:\n\na_n = (4/π^2) * (1 - (-1)^n) / n^2\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) ≈ a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * π * x / 2)], where the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nSince f(x) is continuous and piecewise smooth on the interval [-2, 2], the Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) at all points in the interval. Moreover, since f(x) is piecewise smooth, its Fourier series converges uniformly on the interval [-2, 2]. Finally, since f(x) is square-integrable, its Fourier series converges in mean square on the interval [-2, 2]."
