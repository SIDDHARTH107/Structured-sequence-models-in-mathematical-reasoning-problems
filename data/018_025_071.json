Prove that the order in which you perform the operations affects the outcome, showing that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In this case:\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference operation is commutative with respect to intersection. To do this, we will perform the operations in a different order and see if the result is the same.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of A and the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3} ∩ {1, 4} = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and the intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∆ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3} ∆ {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nAs we can see, the results of these two operations are not the same:\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) ≠ A ∆ (A ∩ B)\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection. The order in which you perform the operations affects the outcome."
