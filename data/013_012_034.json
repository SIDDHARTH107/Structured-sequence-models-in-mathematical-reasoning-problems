    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms in a Stackelberg competition. Firm 1 is the leader and firm 2 is the follower. The market demand function is Q = 400 – 2P where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the market price. Firm 1 has a marginal cost of $20 per unit and firm 2 has a marginal cost of $25 per unit. What will be the market price and quantity produced by each firm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the inverse demand function (P as a function of Q).\n2. Write the profit functions for both firms.\n3. Find the reaction function for firm 2 (the follower).\n4. Substitute the reaction function of firm 2 into the profit function of firm 1.\n5. Maximize the profit function of firm 1 with respect to its quantity.\n6. Find the optimal quantities for both firms.\n7. Calculate the market price.\n\nStep 1: Find the inverse demand function\nQ = 400 - 2P\nP = (400 - Q) / 2\n\nStep 2: Write the profit functions for both firms\nπ1 = (P - MC1) * q1 = ((400 - Q) / 2 - 20) * q1\nπ2 = (P - MC2) * q2 = ((400 - Q) / 2 - 25) * q2\n\nStep 3: Find the reaction function for firm 2\nTo do this, we need to maximize the profit function of firm 2 with respect to its quantity (q2) while treating q1 as given.\nTake the first-order condition (FOC) of π2 with respect to q2 and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π2)/dq2 = ((400 - (q1 + q2)) / 2 - 25) - q2 = 0\n\nSolve for q2 to get the reaction function:\n\nq2 = (175 - q1) / 2\n\nStep 4: Substitute the reaction function of firm 2 into the profit function of firm 1\nSubstitute q2 = (175 - q1) / 2 into the profit function of firm 1:\n\nπ1 = ((400 - (q1 + (175 - q1) / 2)) / 2 - 20) * q1\n\nStep 5: Maximize the profit function of firm 1 with respect to its quantity (q1)\nTake the first-order condition (FOC) of π1 with respect to q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π1)/dq1 = (160 - q1 / 2) - q1 = 0\n\nSolve for q1:\n\nq1 = 160 / (3/2) = 320 / 3\n\nStep 6: Find the optimal quantities for both firms\nNow that we have the optimal quantity for firm 1, we can find the optimal quantity for firm 2 using its reaction function:\n\nq2 = (175 - 320 / 3) / 2 = (175 * 3 - 320) / 6 = 185 / 6\n\nStep 7: Calculate the market price\nNow that we have the optimal quantities for both firms, we can find the market price using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = (400 - (320 / 3 + 185 / 6)) / 2 = (400 * 6 - 320 * 2 - 185 * 3) / (2 * 6) = 365 / 6\n\nSo, the market price is $365/6, firm 1 produces 320/3 units, and firm 2 produces 185/6 units."
