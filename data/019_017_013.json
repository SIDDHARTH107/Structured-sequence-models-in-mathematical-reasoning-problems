    "message_2": "To show that A and B are not isomorphic as R-structures, we need to show that there is no bijection f: A → B such that for all a, b in A, (a, b) ∈ R in A if and only if (f(a), f(b)) ∈ R in B.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an isomorphism f between A and B. Since f is a bijection, it must map each element of A to a unique element of B. Let's consider the possible mappings of f:\n\n1. f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 3\n2. f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 4\n3. f(1) = 1, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 2\n4. f(1) = 1, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 4\n5. f(1) = 1, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 2\n6. f(1) = 1, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 3\n\nWe can eliminate cases 1, 2, 3, and 4 because they would require f(3) to be related to f(2) in B, but 3 is not related to 2 in A. This leaves cases 5 and 6.\n\nIn case 5, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 4, and f(3) = 2. In this case, (1, 2) ∈ R in A, but (f(1), f(2)) = (1, 4) ∉ R in B, which contradicts the isomorphism condition.\n\nIn case 6, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 4, and f(3) = 3. In this case, (2, 3) ∈ R in A, but (f(2), f(3)) = (4, 3) ∉ R in B, which also contradicts the isomorphism condition.\n\nSince none of the possible bijections satisfy the isomorphism condition, we can conclude that A and B are not isomorphic as R-structures."
