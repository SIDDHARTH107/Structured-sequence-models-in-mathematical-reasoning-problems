    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 9 vertices and degree sequence (4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1). Is this a valid degree sequence for a graph? If yes, draw a simple graph that has this degree sequence. If no, explain why it is not a valid degree sequence.",
    "message_2": "This is not a valid degree sequence for a graph. To determine if a degree sequence is valid, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be an even number since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the degrees is:\n\n4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21\n\nSince 21 is an odd number, this degree sequence is not valid for a graph."
