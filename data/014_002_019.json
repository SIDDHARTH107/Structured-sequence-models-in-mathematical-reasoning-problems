Alice chooses a secret number a = 3 and Bob chooses a secret number b = 4. \n\n1. Calculate A = g^a (mod p) \n2. Calculate B = g^b (mod p)\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B, respectively. \n4. Calculate s = B^a (mod p) and t = A^b (mod p)\n5. Verify that s = t. \n\nWhat is the common secret key (s or t) agreed by Alice and Bob for this key exchange?",

Calculate B = g^b (mod p)\n   B = 2^4 (mod 7)\n   B = 16 (mod 7)\n   B = 2\n\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B, respectively. Alice gets B = 2 and Bob gets A = 1.\n\n4.
