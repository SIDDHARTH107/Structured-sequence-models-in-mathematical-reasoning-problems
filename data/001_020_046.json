    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value function f(x) = |x - 3| + 2, we need to determine the point at which the function changes direction. Since the absolute value function changes direction at the point x = 3, the vertex is at the point (3, f(3)).\n\nNow, let's find the value of f(3):\nf(3) = |3 - 3| + 2\nf(3) = |0| + 2\nf(3) = 0 + 2\nf(3) = 2\n\nSo, the vertex of the function is at the point (3, 2).\n\nNext, let's find the x-intercepts of the function. The x-intercepts are the points where the function crosses the x-axis, which means f(x) = 0.\n\n0 = |x - 3| + 2\n\nTo solve for x, we first subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n-2 = |x - 3|\n\nSince the absolute value of a number cannot be negative, there are no x-intercepts for this function.\n\nFinally, let's find the y-intercept of the function. The y-intercept is the point where the function crosses the y-axis, which means x = 0.\n\nf(0) = |0 - 3| + 2\nf(0) = |-3| + 2\nf(0) = 3 + 2\nf(0) = 5\n\nSo, the y-intercept of the function is at the point (0, 5).\n\nIn summary, the vertex of the function f(x) = |x - 3| + 2 is at the point (3, 2), there are no x-intercepts, and the y-intercept is at the point (0, 5)."
