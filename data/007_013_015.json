    "message_2": "Goldbach's Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for large even numbers, and no counterexample has been found. However, it remains unproven. Therefore, we cannot provide the smallest even number greater than 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, as no such number has been found or proven to exist."
