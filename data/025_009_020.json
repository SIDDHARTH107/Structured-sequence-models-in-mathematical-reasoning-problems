    "message_2": "To find the genus of an algebraic curve, we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $g$ is the genus and $d$ is the degree of the curve.\n\nIn this case, the given equation is $y^2 = x^3 - 7x + 10$. The highest degree term is $x^3$, so the degree of the curve is $d = 3$.\n\nNow, we can plug the degree into the genus formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{(2)(1)}{2} = 1$.\n\nSo, the genus of the algebraic curve represented by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 7x + 10$ is $1$."
