    "message_1": "A metal plate in the shape of a square with sides of length 1 meter is heated from the bottom at a constant temperature of 100 °C. The four sides are insulated so that no heat can escape. Find the steady-state temperature distribution inside the plate if the initial temperature is zero everywhere except for a small circular region in the middle of the plate where the temperature is given by: \n\nT(x, y) = 50 + 10(x^2 + y^2)^(1/2)  for (x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) ≤ 0.1 meters  \nT(x, y) = 0 for (x^2 + y^2)^(1/2) > 0.1 meters  \n\nUse Fourier series to solve the relevant partial differential equation.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution inside the plate, we need to solve the two-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∇²T(x, y) = 0\n\nwhere ∇² is the Laplacian operator. In Cartesian coordinates, the Laplacian is given by:\n\n∇²T(x, y) = ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²\n\nSince the problem has a circular symmetry, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates (r, θ) with the origin at the center of the plate. In polar coordinates, the Laplacian is given by:\n\n∇²T(r, θ) = (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂T/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²T/∂θ²\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n\n1. T(r, θ) = 100 °C at r = 0 (heated from the bottom)\n2. ∂T/∂r = 0 at r = 1 (insulated sides)\n3. T(r, θ) = 50 + 10r for r ≤ 0.1 (initial temperature in the circular region)\n4. T(r, θ) = 0 for r > 0.1 (initial temperature outside the circular region)\n\nSince the problem is axisymmetric, we can ignore the θ-dependence and solve the equation in radial coordinates only:\n\n(1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂T/∂r) = 0\n\nIntegrating twice with respect to r, we get:\n\nT(r) = A ln(r) + B\n\nwhere A and B are constants. Applying the boundary conditions:\n\n1. T(0) = 100 => B = 100\n2. ∂T/∂r = 0 at r = 1 => A = 0\n\nSo the steady-state temperature distribution is:\n\nT(r) = 100 °C\n\nThis is independent of the initial temperature distribution, as expected for the steady-state solution. The heat equation ensures that the temperature will eventually become uniform throughout the plate, with the value determined by the boundary conditions."
