The cost of production for each product and the profit earned from each product is given in the table below:\n\n| Product | Cost of Production | Profit |\n|---------|--------------------|--------|\n| A       | $10                | $60    |\n| B       | $20                | $80    |\n\nThe company has a budget of $1000 for the production of these products. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nP(x, y) = 60x + 80y\n\nThe constraint is the budget, which can be represented as:\n\n10x + 20y ≤ 1000\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the linear programming method. First, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequality:\n\n10x + 20y ≤ 1000\nx + 2y ≤ 100\n\nNow, we need to find the corner points of the feasible region. These are the points where the constraint equation is met, and the profit is maximized.\n\n1. When x = 0:\nx + 2y = 100\ny = 50\n\nThe point (0, 50) is a corner point.\n\n2. When y = 0:\nx + 2y = 100\nx = 100\n\nThe point (100, 0) is a corner point.\n\n3. When x and y are both integers and x + 2y = 100:\nThe largest integer value for y that satisfies this equation is y = 49, which gives x = 2.\n\nThe point (2, 49) is a corner point.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each corner point:\n\nP(0, 50) = 60(0) + 80(50) = 0 + 4000 = $4000\nP(100, 0) = 60(100) + 80(0) = 6000 + 0 = $6000\nP(2, 49) = 60(2) + 80(49) = 120 + 3920 = $4040\n\nComparing the profit values, we can see that the maximum profit is $6000, which is achieved when the company produces 100 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
