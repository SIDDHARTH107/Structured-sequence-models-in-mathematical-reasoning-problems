    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 5x - 1, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nUsing the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), we can find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4) + d/dx(2x^3) - d/dx(6x^2) + d/dx(5x) - d/dx(1)\n\nf'(x) = 4*3x^(4-1) + 3*2x^(3-1) - 2*6x^(2-1) + 5 - 0\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 5\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative by differentiating f'(x):\n\nSecond derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3) + d/dx(6x^2) - d/dx(12x) + d/dx(5)\n\nf''(x) = 3*12x^(3-1) + 2*6x^(2-1) - 12\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 + 12x - 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 5x - 1 is f''(x) = 36x^2 + 12x - 12."
