The probabilities of transitioning from one weather condition to another are listed in the transition matrix below.  \n\n|   | Rainy | Cloudy | Sunny |\n|---|-------|--------|-------|\n| Rainy | 0.6 | 0.3    | 0.1   |\n| Cloudy | 0.4 | 0.2    | 0.4   |\n| Sunny | 0.2 | 0.3    | 0.5   |\n\nIf the city is currently in a cloudy weather condition, what is the probability that it will be sunny two days from now?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that it will be sunny two days from now, we need to multiply the transition matrix by itself (square the matrix) and then look at the entry corresponding to the transition from cloudy to sunny.\n\nThe transition matrix squared is:\n\n|   | Rainy | Cloudy | Sunny |\n|---|-------|--------|-------|\n| Rainy | 0.52 | 0.33    | 0.15   |\n| Cloudy | 0.36 | 0.22    | 0.42   |\n| Sunny | 0.26 | 0.27    | 0.47   |\n\nSo, the probability that it will be sunny two days from now, given that it is currently cloudy, is 0.42."
