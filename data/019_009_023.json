    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, we need to constructively prove or disprove the statement. The statement ¬(∀x∈R, ∃y∈R | y < x) can be translated as \"There exists an x in the set of real numbers R such that for all y in R, y is not less than x.\"\n\nLet's try to find such an x. Consider x = -∞ (negative infinity). For any real number y, y will always be greater than -∞. However, -∞ is not a real number, so we cannot use it as a counterexample.\n\nNow, let's consider any real number x. We can always find a real number y such that y < x. For example, we can take y = x - 1. Since x - 1 is also a real number, we have found a y that is less than x.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that for any x in the set of real numbers R, there exists a y in R such that y < x. This means the original statement ¬(∀x∈R, ∃y∈R | y < x) is false in intuitionistic logic."
