    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle, we need to find the angle opposite the shortest side, which is 10 cm in this case. Let's call this angle A, and the other two sides adjacent to it as b (12 cm) and c (15 cm). We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle A.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that:\na² = b² + c² - 2bc * cos(A)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle, and A is the angle opposite side a.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n10² = 12² + 15² - 2 * 12 * 15 * cos(A)\n\nSolving for cos(A):\ncos(A) = (12² + 15² - 10²) / (2 * 12 * 15)\ncos(A) = (144 + 225 - 100) / (360)\ncos(A) = (269) / (360)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\nA = arccos(cos(A))\nA = arccos(269/360)\n\nA ≈ 46.3°\n\nSo, the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 46.3°."
