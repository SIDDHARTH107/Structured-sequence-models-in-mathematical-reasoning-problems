    "message_2": "First, let's find A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the two Cartesian products.\n\nIntersection (A × B) ∩ (B × A) = {(a, b) | (a, b) ∈ A × B and (a, b) ∈ B × A}\n\nComparing the elements of A × B and B × A, we can see that there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, the intersection is an empty set:\n\n(A × B) ∩ (B × A) = ∅\n\nSince the intersection is an empty set, it is clear that A × B and B × A are not equal."
