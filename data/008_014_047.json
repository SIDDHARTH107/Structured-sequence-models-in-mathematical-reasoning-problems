    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  2  3  1 |\n    |  4  7  4 |\n    | -2 -5 -3 |\n\nb = | 12 |\n    | 29 |\n    | -7 |\n\nNow, we will perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we will decompose A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R.\n\nFirst, we find the orthonormal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = a1 = (2, 4, -2)\ne1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (2, 4, -2) / sqrt(2^2 + 4^2 + (-2)^2) = (1/3, 2/3, -1/3)\n\nu2 = a2 - proj_a2(u1) = (3, 7, -5) - ((3, 7, -5) • e1) * e1\nu2 = (3, 7, -5) - (11) * (1/3, 2/3, -1/3) = (0, 1, -2)\ne2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (0, 1, -2) / sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + (-2)^2) = (0, 1/√5, -2/√5)\n\nu3 = a3 - proj_a3(u1) - proj_a3(u2) = (1, 4, -3) - ((1, 4, -3) • e1) * e1 - ((1, 4, -3) • e2) * e2\nu3 = (1, 4, -3) - (4) * (1/3, 2/3, -1/3) - (2) * (0, 1/√5, -2/√5) = (0, 0, 1)\ne3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (0, 0, 1) / sqrt(0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = (0, 0, 1)\n\nNow, we have the orthonormal basis e1, e2, and e3. The matrix Q is formed by these basis vectors as columns:\n\nQ = |  1/3  0  0 |\n    |  2/3  1/√5  0 |\n    | -1/3 -2/√5  1 |\n\nThe matrix R is an upper triangular matrix with the following form:\n\nR = | ||u1||  e1•a2  e1•a3 |\n    |   0    ||u2||  e2•a3 |\n    |   0      0    ||u3|| |\n\nR = |  sqrt(2^2 + 4^2 + (-2)^2)  (1/3, 2/3, -1/3)•(3, 7, -5)  (1/3, 2/3, -1/3)•(1, 4, -3) |\n    |          0                sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + (-2)^2)  (0, 1/√5, -2/√5)•(1, 4, -3) |\n    |          0                    0                    sqrt(0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) |\n\nR = |  sqrt(24)  11  4 |\n    |     0      √5  2 |\n    |     0       0   1 |\n\nNow, we have the QR decomposition of A: A = QR.\n\nTo solve the system Ax = b, we can rewrite it as QRx = b. Then, we can solve the system in two steps:\n\n1. Solve Qy = b for y.\n2. Solve Rx = y for x.\n\nStep 1: Solve Qy = b for y.\n\nQy = b\n|  1/3  0  0 | | y1 |   | 12 |\n|  2/3  1/√5  0 | | y2 | = | 29 |\n| -1/3 -2/√5  1 | | y3 |   | -7 |\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying both sides by the transpose of Q:\n\nQ^TQy = Q^Tb\n|  1/3  2/3 -1/3 | |  1/3  0  0 | | y1 |   |  1/3  2/3 -1/3 | | 12 |\n|    0  1/√5 -2/√5 | |  0  1/√5  0 | | y2 | = |    0  1/√5 -2/√5 | | 29 |\n|    0    0    1 | | -1/3 -2/√5  1 | | y3 |   |    0    0    1 | | -7 |\n\nSince Q is an orthogonal matrix, Q^TQ = I (identity matrix):\n\n| y1 |   |  1/3  2/3 -1/3 | | 12 |\n| y2 | = |    0  1/√5 -2/√5 | | 29 |\n| y3 |   |    0    0    1 | | -7 |\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny1 = (1/3)(12) = 4\ny2 = (1/√5)(29) - (2/√5)(-7) = 9\ny3 = -7\n\nSo, y = (4, 9, -7).\n\nStep 2: Solve Rx = y for x.\n\n|  sqrt(24)  11  4 | | x1 |   |  4 |\n|     0      √5  2 | | x2 | = |  9 |\n|     0       0   1 | | x3 |   | -7 |\n\nWe can solve this system using back-substitution:\n\nx3 = -7\nx2 = (9 - 2(-7))/√5 = 3\nx1 = (4 - 11(3) - 4(-7))/sqrt(24) = 1\n\nSo, x = (1, 3, -7).\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 3, and z = -7."
