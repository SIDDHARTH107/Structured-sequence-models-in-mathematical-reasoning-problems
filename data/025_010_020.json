    "message_1": "Let X be the projective curve defined by the equation $y^2z=x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is a constant. Suppose that $p_1=(0:1:0)$ and $p_2=(1:0:0)$ are two distinct points on X. Using Riemann-Roch theorem, determine the dimension of the vector space of meromorphic functions on X with poles of order at most 2 at $p_1$ and $p_2$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for the curve X. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a curve X of genus g, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles bounded by D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nFirst, let's compute the genus g of the curve X. The curve X is given by the equation $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$, which is a smooth plane curve of degree 3. By the genus-degree formula, we have:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1$\n\nNow, let's determine the divisor D. We want to consider meromorphic functions with poles of order at most 2 at $p_1$ and $p_2$. So, we can write the divisor D as:\n\n$D = 2p_1 + 2p_2$\n\nThe degree of D is:\n\n$deg(D) = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\nNext, we need to find the canonical divisor K. For a smooth plane curve of degree d, the canonical divisor can be computed as:\n\n$K = (d-3)H$\n\nwhere H is the hyperplane divisor. In our case, d = 3, so:\n\n$K = (3-3)H = 0$\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$l(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nSince K = 0, we have $K - D = -D$, and thus:\n\n$l(D) - l(-D) = 4 + 1 - 1$\n\n$l(D) - l(-D) = 4$\n\nNow, we need to compute $l(-D)$. Since the degree of $-D$ is negative, we know that there are no meromorphic functions with poles bounded by $-D$. Therefore, $l(-D) = 0$, and we have:\n\n$l(D) = 4$\n\nSo, the dimension of the vector space of meromorphic functions on X with poles of order at most 2 at $p_1$ and $p_2$ is 4."
