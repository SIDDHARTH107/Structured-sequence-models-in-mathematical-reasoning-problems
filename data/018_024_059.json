    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference (A Δ B). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 4, 6}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 3, 6}\n\nNow, we need to find the complement of set A (A'). The complement of a set A is the set of elements not in A. Since there is no universal set mentioned, we cannot find the exact complement of A. However, we can still find the symmetric difference with respect to the elements we have.\n\n(A Δ B) Δ A' = ({1, 3, 6} Δ A')\n\nSince A' contains all elements not in A, it does not contain any elements from A. Therefore, the symmetric difference will not include any elements from A.\n\n(A Δ B) Δ A' = {1, 3, 6}\n\nSo, the final answer is {1, 3, 6}."
