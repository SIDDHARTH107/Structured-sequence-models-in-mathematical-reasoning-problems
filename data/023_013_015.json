    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = T_initial + ΔT * erf(x / (2 * sqrt(α * t)))\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature at depth x and time t, T_initial is the initial temperature, ΔT is the temperature increase, erf is the error function, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the depth.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\nΔT = 50°C\nα = 0.0001 m^2/s\nx = 0.01 m\n\nWe want to find the time t when the temperature at depth x reaches a certain percentage of the temperature increase. Let's assume we want to find the time when the temperature reaches 90% of the temperature increase (45°C). \n\nFirst, we need to find the value of the error function at this temperature:\n\nerf(x / (2 * sqrt(α * t))) = (T(x, t) - T_initial) / ΔT\n\nSince we are looking for the time when the temperature reaches 90% of the temperature increase:\n\n0.9 = erf(x / (2 * sqrt(α * t)))\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse error function (erf_inv) of 0.9:\n\nerf_inv(0.9) = x / (2 * sqrt(α * t))\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for t:\n\nt = (x / (2 * sqrt(α) * erf_inv(0.9)))^2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nt = (0.01 / (2 * sqrt(0.0001) * erf_inv(0.9)))^2\n\nt ≈ 315.34 seconds\n\nSo, it takes approximately 315.34 seconds for the temperature to reach a depth of 0.01 meters in the metal plate, assuming we want the temperature to reach 90% of the temperature increase."
