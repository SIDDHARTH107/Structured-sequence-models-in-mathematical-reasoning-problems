    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative polynomial ring $R = \\mathbb{C}\\langle x,y\\rangle/(yx-xy-1)$ and the ideal $I = \\langle x-1,y-1 \\rangle \\subseteq R$. What is the Hilbert series $H_R(t)$ and Hilbert function $H_I(n)$ of $R$ and $I$ respectively?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Hilbert series $H_R(t)$ of the noncommutative polynomial ring $R$. Since $R$ is a quotient of the free algebra $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x,y \\rangle$, its elements can be represented by noncommutative monomials in $x$ and $y$. The relation $yx - xy = 1$ allows us to rewrite any monomial containing $yx$ as a linear combination of monomials with $xy$. Therefore, a basis for $R$ as a $\\mathbb{C}$-vector space consists of monomials of the form $x^i y^j$ with $i, j \\geq 0$. The number of such monomials of total degree $n$ is $n+1$, so the Hilbert function of $R$ is given by $H_R(n) = n+1$. The Hilbert series of $R$ is then the generating function for the Hilbert function:\n\n$$H_R(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} H_R(n) t^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n+1) t^n = \\frac{1}{(1-t)^2}.$$\n\nNow let's find the Hilbert function $H_I(n)$ of the ideal $I$. Since $I$ is generated by $x-1$ and $y-1$, its elements can be represented by linear combinations of monomials of the form $(x-1)^i (y-1)^j$ with $i, j \\geq 0$. The total degree of such a monomial is $i+j$. To count the number of monomials of total degree $n$ in $I$, we can consider the number of ways to choose $i$ and $j$ such that $i+j=n$. This is equivalent to the number of ways to distribute $n$ indistinguishable balls into two distinguishable boxes, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n+1}{1} = n+1$. Therefore, the Hilbert function of $I$ is $H_I(n) = n+1$.\n\nNote that the Hilbert function of $I$ is the same as that of $R$. This is because the ideal $I$ is a codimension-1 subspace of $R$, so their dimensions as $\\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces differ by 1 in each degree."
