    "message_2": "First, let's find AxB (the Cartesian product of sets A and B). AxB consists of all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nAxB = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\nNow, let's find C, which is the set {1,2}. We will now find (AxB)xC and AxBxC.\n\n1. (AxB)xC: This means we need to find the Cartesian product of the sets (AxB) and C. So, we need to find all possible ordered pairs ((a, b), c) where (a, b) is an element of AxB and c is an element of C.\n\n(AxB)xC = {((1,2),1), ((1,2),2), ((1,3),1), ((1,3),2), ((2,2),1), ((2,2),2), ((2,3),1), ((2,3),2)}\n\n2. AxBxC: This means we need to find the Cartesian product of the sets A, B, and C. So, we need to find all possible ordered triples (a, b, c) where a is an element of A, b is an element of B, and c is an element of C.\n\nAxBxC = {(1,2,1), (1,2,2), (1,3,1), (1,3,2), (2,2,1), (2,2,2), (2,3,1), (2,3,2)}\n\nNow, let's compare (AxB)xC and AxBxC:\n\n(AxB)xC = {((1,2),1), ((1,2),2), ((1,3),1), ((1,3),2), ((2,2),1), ((2,2),2), ((2,3),1), ((2,3),2)}\n\nAxBxC = {(1,2,1), (1,2,2), (1,3,1), (1,3,2), (2,2,1), (2,2,2), (2,3,1), (2,3,2)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements of (AxB)xC are ordered pairs, while the elements of AxBxC are ordered triples. Therefore, (AxB)xC is not equal to AxBxC."
