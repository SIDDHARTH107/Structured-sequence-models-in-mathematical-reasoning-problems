    "message_1": "Sorry, but a precise numerical problem cannot be generated for the subtopic Paraconsistent logic as it deals with non-classical logic systems that do not follow the usual principles of Boolean algebra. It is focused on resolving contradictions in a logical system without leading to inconsistency. It is more of a theoretical topic and does not have direct applications for numerical problem-solving as in classical logic. You can consider exploring other subtopics in logic, such as propositional logic or predicate logic, to generate numerical problems. Let me know if you need help with that.",
    "message_2": "I understand your point about paraconsistent logic. If you would like to explore a problem in propositional logic or predicate logic, please provide a specific problem or scenario, and I will be happy to help you with that."
