    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian circuit is an Eulerian path that starts and ends at the same vertex.\n\nTo determine if there exists an Eulerian path or circuit, we need to check the degrees of the vertices in the graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.\n\nDegrees of the vertices:\nA: 3\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 3\nE: 3\n\nA graph has an Eulerian circuit if all vertices have even degrees. In this case, vertex C has an even degree, but vertices A, B, D, and E have odd degrees. Therefore, there is no Eulerian circuit in this graph.\n\nA graph has an Eulerian path if exactly two vertices have odd degrees, and the remaining vertices have even degrees. In this case, we have exactly two vertices with even degrees (C) and three vertices with odd degrees (A, B, D, E). Therefore, there is no Eulerian path in this graph.\n\nIn conclusion, the given graph does not have an Eulerian path or an Eulerian circuit."
