    "message_2": "To find the expected value and variance of X(t) for t = 5, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The given SDE is a linear SDE of the form:\n\ndX(t) = aX(t)dt + b dW(t)\n\nwhere a = -0.4 and b = 2. The solution to this SDE is given by:\n\nX(t) = X(0) * exp(at) + b * integral from 0 to t of exp(a(t-s)) dW(s)\n\nNow, we can find the expected value and variance of X(t) for t = 5.\n\n1. Expected value of X(t):\n\nE[X(t)] = E[X(0) * exp(at) + b * integral from 0 to t of exp(a(t-s)) dW(s)]\n\nSince X(0) = 1 and W(t) is a standard Brownian motion, we have:\n\nE[X(t)] = E[exp(-0.4t)] + 2 * E[integral from 0 to t of exp(-0.4(t-s)) dW(s)]\n\nThe expected value of the integral term is 0 because the integrand is a martingale. Therefore:\n\nE[X(t)] = E[exp(-0.4t)]\n\nFor t = 5:\n\nE[X(5)] = exp(-0.4 * 5) = exp(-2) ≈ 0.1353\n\n2. Variance of X(t):\n\nVar[X(t)] = E[X(t)^2] - (E[X(t)])^2\n\nFirst, we find E[X(t)^2]:\n\nE[X(t)^2] = E[(X(0) * exp(at) + b * integral from 0 to t of exp(a(t-s)) dW(s))^2]\n\nE[X(t)^2] = E[exp(2at) + 2b * exp(at) * integral from 0 to t of exp(a(t-s)) dW(s) + b^2 * (integral from 0 to t of exp(a(t-s)) dW(s))^2]\n\nSince the expected value of the integral term is 0, the cross term vanishes:\n\nE[X(t)^2] = E[exp(2at)] + b^2 * E[(integral from 0 to t of exp(a(t-s)) dW(s))^2]\n\nUsing Ito's isometry, we have:\n\nE[(integral from 0 to t of exp(a(t-s)) dW(s))^2] = integral from 0 to t of E[exp(2a(t-s))] ds\n\nE[X(t)^2] = E[exp(2at)] + b^2 * integral from 0 to t of E[exp(2a(t-s))] ds\n\nFor t = 5:\n\nE[X(5)^2] = exp(2 * -0.4 * 5) + 2^2 * integral from 0 to 5 of exp(2 * -0.4 * (5 - s)) ds\nE[X(5)^2] = exp(-4) + 4 * integral from 0 to 5 of exp(-8 + 0.8s) ds\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can use integration by substitution:\n\nLet u = -8 + 0.8s, then du = 0.8 ds\n\nE[X(5)^2] = exp(-4) + 4 * integral of exp(u) * (1/0.8) du from u = -8 to u = 0\nE[X(5)^2] = exp(-4) + 5 * (exp(0) - exp(-8))\nE[X(5)^2] = exp(-4) + 5 * (1 - exp(-8)) ≈ 0.0183 + 5 * 0.9997 ≈ 5.0183\n\nNow, we can find the variance:\n\nVar[X(5)] = E[X(5)^2] - (E[X(5)])^2 ≈ 5.0183 - (0.1353)^2 ≈ 5.0183 - 0.0183 ≈ 5\n\nSo, the expected value of X(5) is approximately 0.1353, and the variance of X(5) is approximately 5."
