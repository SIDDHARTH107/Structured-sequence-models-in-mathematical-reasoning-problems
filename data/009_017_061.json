    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 mm away from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is a part of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. So, we can choose a circular path of radius r (2 mm in this case) as our loop. The magnetic field is tangent to the loop at every point, so B⋅dl = B * dl. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n∮B * dl = μ₀I\n\nSince B is constant along the circular path, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀I\n\nThe integral of dl around the circular path is equal to the circumference of the circle, which is 2πr:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nWe are given the current I = 5 A, and the distance r = 2 mm = 0.002 m. The permeability of free space, μ₀, is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 0.002 m)\n\nB ≈ (20 × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.004 m\n\nB ≈ 5 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 mm away from the center of the wire is approximately 5 × 10^(-5) T (Tesla).\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be in concentric circles around the wire, with the direction depending on the orientation of the current."
