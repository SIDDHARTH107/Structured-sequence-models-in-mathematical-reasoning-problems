    "message_1": "A ladder leans against a wall forming a right triangle with the wall and the ground. If the length of the ladder is 20 feet and it is placed 16 feet away from the wall, what is the height of the ladder on the wall? Use the Pythagorean theorem to solve.",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the ladder is the hypotenuse, and the distance from the wall and the height on the wall are the other two sides. Let's denote the height on the wall as h.\n\nThe theorem can be written as:\n\nladder^2 = distance^2 + height^2\n\nGiven the length of the ladder is 20 feet and the distance from the wall is 16 feet, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n20^2 = 16^2 + h^2\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\n400 = 256 + h^2\n400 - 256 = h^2\n144 = h^2\n\nNow, we can find the value of h by taking the square root of both sides:\n\nâˆš144 = h\n12 = h\n\nSo, the height of the ladder on the wall is 12 feet."
