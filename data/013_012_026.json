The AI company is the leader and the tech startup is the follower in a Stackelberg competition. The payoff matrix is shown below:\n\n|         | AI Company | Tech Startup |\n|---------|------------|--------------|\n| AI Company | (10, 5)    | (8, 4)         |\n| Tech Startup | (6, 3)     | (7, 2)         |\n\nIf the AI Company announces its strategy first, what decision should it make to maximize its payoff and what decision will be made by the Tech Startup in response? What will be the final outcome of the game?",
    "message_2": "In a Stackelberg competition, the leader (AI Company) announces its strategy first, and the follower (Tech Startup) responds accordingly. To maximize its payoff, the AI Company should anticipate the Tech Startup's response to each of its possible strategies.\n\nIf the AI Company chooses the AI Company strategy:\n- The Tech Startup will choose between (10, 5) and (6, 3). Since the Tech Startup wants to maximize its own payoff, it will choose the AI Company strategy, resulting in a payoff of (10, 5).\n\nIf the AI Company chooses the Tech Startup strategy:\n- The Tech Startup will choose between (8, 4) and (7, 2). The Tech Startup will choose the AI Company strategy, resulting in a payoff of (8, 4).\n\nTo maximize its payoff, the AI Company should choose the AI Company strategy, as it results in a higher payoff for them (10 vs. 8). In response, the Tech Startup will also choose the AI Company strategy. The final outcome of the game will be the AI Company strategy for both players, with a payoff of (10, 5)."
