    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (z^3 + 1)/(z - 1)(z + 2i) at z = 1, we first need to rewrite the function in a way that isolates the singular point z = 1. We can do this by performing a partial fraction decomposition.\n\nLet f(z) = A/(z - 1) + B/(z + 2i), where A and B are constants that we need to determine.\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z - 1)(z + 2i), we get:\n\nz^3 + 1 = A(z + 2i) + B(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in the singular points:\n\n1. For z = 1:\n1^3 + 1 = A(1 + 2i) + B(1 - 1)\n2 = A(1 + 2i)\nA = 2/(1 + 2i) = (2 - 4i)/5\n\n2. For z = -2i:\n(-2i)^3 + 1 = A(-2i - 1) + B(-2i + 2i)\n8i + 1 = -A - 2Ai\nA = (1 - 8i)/(-1 - 2i) = (1 - 8i)/(-1 - 2i) * (-1 + 2i)/(-1 + 2i) = (17 - 6i)/5\n\nNow that we have the values of A and B, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (2 - 4i)/5 * 1/(z - 1) + (17 - 6i)/5 * 1/(z + 2i)\n\nThe residue of f(z) at z = 1 is the coefficient of the 1/(z - 1) term, which is:\n\nResidue = (2 - 4i)/5"
