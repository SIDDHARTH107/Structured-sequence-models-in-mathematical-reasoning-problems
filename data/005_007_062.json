    "message_2": "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of x (hours studied) and y (exam score).\n2. Calculate the difference between each value and its mean (x - mean_x and y - mean_y).\n3. Multiply the differences for each pair (x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y).\n4. Calculate the sum of these products.\n5. Calculate the sum of the squared differences for x and y.\n6. Divide the sum of the products by the square root of the product of the sums of the squared differences.\n7. Round the result to two decimal places.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Mean of x (hours studied): (5 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 4) / 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\n   Mean of y (exam score): (75 + 78 + 63 + 85 + 70) / 5 = 371 / 5 = 74.2\n\n2. Differences:\n   | x - mean_x | y - mean_y |\n   |------------|------------|\n   | 0          | 0.8        |\n   | 1          | 3.8        |\n   | -2         | -11.2      |\n   | 2          | 10.8       |\n   | -1         | -4.2       |\n\n3. Multiply the differences:\n   | (x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y) |\n   |------------------------------|\n   | 0                            |\n   | 3.8                          |\n   | 22.4                         |\n   | 21.6                         |\n   | 4.2                          |\n\n4. Sum of the products: 0 + 3.8 + 22.4 + 21.6 + 4.2 = 52\n\n5. Sum of the squared differences:\n   Sum of (x - mean_x)^2: 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10\n   Sum of (y - mean_y)^2: 0.64 + 14.44 + 125.44 + 116.64 + 17.64 = 274.8\n\n6. Divide the sum of the products by the square root of the product of the sums of the squared differences:\n   r = 52 / sqrt(10 * 274.8) = 52 / sqrt(2748) ≈ 0.976\n\n7. Round the result to two decimal places: r ≈ 0.98\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of hours students study each week and their average exam score is approximately 0.98."
