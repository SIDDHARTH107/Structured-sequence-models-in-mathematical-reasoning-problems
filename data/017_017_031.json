    "message_2": "To prove that there exists no non-abelian group of order 30 that is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, we will first analyze the properties of a group of order 30 and the dihedral group D10. Then, we will show that these properties are not compatible, and therefore, no such isomorphism exists.\n\nA group of order 30 has the following properties:\n1. The order of the group is 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5.\n2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n2) must divide 15 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n2 = 1 or 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n3) must divide 10 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n3 = 1 or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n5) must divide 6 and be congruent to 1 mod 5, so n5 = 1 or 6.\n\nThe dihedral group D10 has the following properties:\n1. The order of the group is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5.\n2. It is a non-abelian group.\n3. It has a cyclic subgroup of order 10, generated by a rotation, and a subgroup of order 2, generated by a reflection.\n\nNow, let's assume there exists a non-abelian group G of order 30 that is isomorphic to D10. Then, G must have a cyclic subgroup of order 10 and a subgroup of order 2. By the Sylow theorems, G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Let's denote this subgroup as H. Since G is non-abelian, there must be at least one non-normal Sylow 2-subgroup or Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nHowever, if G is isomorphic to D10, then G should have a subgroup of order 20, which is not possible since the order of G is 30. Moreover, D10 has a unique subgroup of order 10, while a group of order 30 can have multiple Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, which contradicts the isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, there exists no non-abelian group of order 30 that is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10."
