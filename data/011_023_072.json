    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to consider the graph's chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors that can be used to color the vertices of the graph in this way.\n\nHowever, without knowing the structure of the graph (i.e., how the vertices are connected), it is not possible to determine the exact chromatic number. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the chromatic number would be equal to the number of vertices, which is 7.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, the graph is a tree or a forest, meaning that it has no cycles. In this case, the chromatic number would be at most 2, as you can always color a tree with just 2 colors.\n\nSo, without more information about the structure of the graph, the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of this graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color could be anywhere between 2 and 7."
