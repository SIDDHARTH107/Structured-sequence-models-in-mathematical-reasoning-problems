    "message_1": "In a moral hazard scenario, an automobile insurance policyholder has a 40% chance of getting in an accident that results in a $10,000 claim and a 60% chance of no accident. The policyholder must choose between adopting either a safe driving policy with a $500 premium or a risky driving policy with a $100 premium. The safe driving policy reduces the likelihood of an accident to 20%. Which policy should the policyholder adopt to maximize their expected profit, assuming that the cost of the accident to the policyholder is higher than the policy premiums?",
    "message_2": "To determine which policy the policyholder should adopt to maximize their expected profit, we need to calculate the expected cost of each policy.\n\nSafe driving policy:\n- Premium: $500\n- Probability of an accident: 20% (0.2)\n- Probability of no accident: 80% (0.8)\n- Claim amount: $10,000\n\nExpected cost of safe driving policy = (Premium) + (Probability of an accident * Claim amount)\n= $500 + (0.2 * $10,000)\n= $500 + $2,000\n= $2,500\n\nRisky driving policy:\n- Premium: $100\n- Probability of an accident: 40% (0.4)\n- Probability of no accident: 60% (0.6)\n- Claim amount: $10,000\n\nExpected cost of risky driving policy = (Premium) + (Probability of an accident * Claim amount)\n= $100 + (0.4 * $10,000)\n= $100 + $4,000\n= $4,100\n\nComparing the expected costs of both policies, the safe driving policy has a lower expected cost ($2,500) than the risky driving policy ($4,100). Therefore, the policyholder should adopt the safe driving policy to maximize their expected profit, as it has a lower expected cost."
