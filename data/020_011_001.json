    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific numerical problem for Multi-objective optimization:\n\n\"A company produces two products, X and Y. Each product requires resources for manufacturing, including raw materials and labor hours. Product X requires 4 units of raw material and 10 labor hours, while product Y requires 6 units of raw material and 8 labor hours. The company has a limited budget and can only allocate $1000 for raw materials and $800 for labor. Find the production quantities of product X and Y that maximize the total revenue, given that the revenue earned per unit of X and Y is $50 and $60, respectively.\"",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe constraints for raw materials and labor hours are as follows:\n\nRaw materials: 4x + 6y ≤ 1000\nLabor hours: 10x + 8y ≤ 800\n\nWe want to maximize the total revenue, which is given by:\n\nRevenue = 50x + 60y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 1000\n10x + 8y ≤ 800\n\nDivide the first inequality by 2:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 500\n\nDivide the second inequality by 2:\n\n5x + 4y ≤ 400\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of 2x + 3y = 500 and 5x + 4y = 400\n2. Intersection of 2x + 3y = 500 and y = 0\n3. Intersection of 5x + 4y = 400 and y = 0\n4. Intersection of 5x + 4y = 400 and x = 0\n5. Intersection of 2x + 3y = 500 and x = 0\n\nSolving for the corner points:\n\n1. Intersection of 2x + 3y = 500 and 5x + 4y = 400\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation multiplied by 2.5:\n\n5x + 4y = 400\n- (5x + 7.5y = 1250)\n\n-3.5y = -850\ny = 850/3.5 = 100/0.5 = 200\n\nSubstituting y back into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(200) = 500\n2x + 600 = 500\n2x = -100\nx = -50\n\nSince x cannot be negative, this intersection point is not feasible.\n\n2. Intersection of 2x + 3y = 500 and y = 0\n\n2x = 500\nx = 250\n\nThe point is (250, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of 5x + 4y = 400 and y = 0\n\n5x = 400\nx = 80\n\nThe point is (80, 0).\n\n4. Intersection of 5x + 4y = 400 and x = 0\n\n4y = 400\ny = 100\n\nThe point is (0, 100).\n\n5. Intersection of 2x + 3y = 500 and x = 0\n\n3y = 500\ny = 500/3\n\nSince y is not an integer, this intersection point is not feasible.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the total revenue at the feasible corner points:\n\n1. (250, 0): Revenue = 50(250) + 60(0) = 12500\n2. (80, 0): Revenue = 50(80) + 60(0) = 4000\n3. (0, 100): Revenue = 50(0) + 60(100) = 6000\n\nThe maximum revenue is $12,500, which occurs when the company produces 250 units of product X and 0 units of product Y."
