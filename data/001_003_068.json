    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we'll multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n4x + 2y = 10 (Equation 1)\n4x - 6y = -16 (Equation 2, after multiplying by 2)\n\nNow, we'll subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate x:\n\n(4x - 6y) - (4x + 2y) = -16 - 10\n-8y = -26\n\nNow, we'll solve for y:\n\ny = -26 / -8\ny = 13/4\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for x. We'll use Equation 1:\n\n4x + 2(13/4) = 10\n4x + 13/2 = 10\n\nTo solve for x, we'll first convert all terms to have a common denominator, which is 4:\n\n8x + 13 = 20\n\nNow, we'll subtract 13 from both sides:\n\n8x = 7\n\nFinally, we'll divide by 8 to get the value of x:\n\nx = 7/8\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 7/8 and y = 13/4."
