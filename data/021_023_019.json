    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the GWO algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 4.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n- Number of wolves (n) = 5 (alpha, beta, delta, and two omega wolves)\n- Number of iterations (T) = 100\n- Search space: [-10, 10]\n\n2. Initialize the positions of the wolves randomly within the search space.\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf using the function f(x).\n\n4. Identify the alpha, beta, and delta wolves (the three best solutions).\n\n5. Update the positions of the wolves using the following equations:\n\nX(t+1) = X(t) - A(t) * D(t)\n\nwhere\n- X(t) is the current position of the wolf\n- A(t) is a vector that decreases linearly from 2 to 0 over the iterations\n- D(t) is the distance between the current position and the best positions (alpha, beta, and delta)\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the specified number of iterations (T).\n\n7. The position of the alpha wolf at the end of the iterations represents the optimal solution.\n\nHere is a simple implementation of the GWO algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 3*x + 4\n\ndef gwo(n, T, search_space):\n    wolves = np.random.uniform(search_space[0], search_space[1], n)\n    fitness = np.array([f(x) for x in wolves])\n    alpha, beta, delta = np.argsort(fitness)[:3]\n\n    for t in range(T):\n        a = 2 - 2 * (t / T)\n        for i in range(n):\n            A_alpha = 2 * a * np.random.rand() - a\n            A_beta = 2 * a * np.random.rand() - a\n            A_delta = 2 * a * np.random.rand() - a\n\n            D_alpha = abs(wolves[alpha] - wolves[i])\n            D_beta = abs(wolves[beta] - wolves[i])\n            D_delta = abs(wolves[delta] - wolves[i])\n\n            X_alpha = wolves[alpha] - A_alpha * D_alpha\n            X_beta = wolves[beta] - A_beta * D_beta\n            X_delta = wolves[delta] - A_delta * D_delta\n\n            wolves[i] = (X_alpha + X_beta + X_delta) / 3\n\n            new_fitness = f(wolves[i])\n            if new_fitness < fitness[i]:\n                fitness[i] = new_fitness\n                if new_fitness < fitness[alpha]:\n                    delta = beta\n                    beta = alpha\n                    alpha = i\n                elif new_fitness < fitness[beta]:\n                    delta = beta\n                    beta = i\n                elif new_fitness < fitness[delta]:\n                    delta = i\n\n    return wolves[alpha], f(wolves[alpha])\n\nn = 5\nT = 100\nsearch_space = [-10, 10]\noptimal_x, optimal_value = gwo(n, T, search_space)\nprint(f\"Optimal x: {optimal_x}, Minimum value: {optimal_value}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation will output the optimal x value and the minimum value of the function f(x) using the GWO algorithm. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm."
