    "message_2": "Using trigonometry to find the perimeter of the triangle is not necessary, as the perimeter is simply the sum of the lengths of all three sides. However, if you insist on using trigonometry, we can do the following:\n\nFirst, let's find the angles of the triangle using the Law of Cosines. Let the sides be a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and c = 9 cm, and let the angles opposite to these sides be A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nWe can solve for angle C:\n\n9² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(C)\n81 = 25 + 49 - 70 * cos(C)\n7 = cos(C)\n\nThis is not possible, as the cosine of an angle cannot be greater than 1 or less than -1. This means that the given side lengths do not form a valid triangle. Therefore, we cannot find the perimeter using trigonometry or any other method, as the triangle does not exist."
