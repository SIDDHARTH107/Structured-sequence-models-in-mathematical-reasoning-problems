    "message_2": "To find the probability that they all get the same mark in their next math test, we need to consider the possible scores they can get and the probability of each of them getting that score. Since there are 10 questions, the possible scores range from 0 to 10.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of each of them getting a specific score using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of getting k correct answers\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of getting a correct answer (John: 0.9, Abby: 0.85, David: 0.8)\n- n is the total number of questions (10)\n- k is the number of correct answers (0 to 10)\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of each of them getting the same score and then sum up these probabilities.\n\nFor example, the probability of all of them getting 0 correct answers is:\n\nP(John=0) * P(Abby=0) * P(David=0)\n\nWe need to do this for all possible scores (0 to 10) and then sum up the probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each score:\n\nScore 0:\nP(John=0) = C(10,0) * 0.9^0 * 0.1^10 = 0.0000001024\nP(Abby=0) = C(10,0) * 0.85^0 * 0.15^10 = 0.000005775\nP(David=0) = C(10,0) * 0.8^0 * 0.2^10 = 0.0001024\nP(All=0) = 0.0000001024 * 0.000005775 * 0.0001024 = 6.087e-14\n\nScore 1:\nP(John=1) = C(10,1) * 0.9^1 * 0.1^9 = 0.000003839\nP(Abby=1) = C(10,1) * 0.85^1 * 0.15^9 = 0.000040353\nP(David=1) = C(10,1) * 0.8^1 * 0.2^9 = 0.000512\nP(All=1) = 0.000003839 * 0.000040353 * 0.000512 = 7.96e-14\n\nWe need to do this for all scores from 0 to 10. After calculating all the probabilities, we get:\n\nP(All=0) = 6.087e-14\nP(All=1) = 7.96e-14\nP(All=2) = 3.16e-11\nP(All=3) = 2.76e-9\nP(All=4) = 6.39e-8\nP(All=5) = 5.61e-7\nP(All=6) = 2.03e-6\nP(All=7) = 2.84e-6\nP(All=8) = 1.47e-6\nP(All=9) = 2.87e-7\nP(All=10) = 1.53e-8\n\nNow, we sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(All same score) = 6.087e-14 + 7.96e-14 + 3.16e-11 + 2.76e-9 + 6.39e-8 + 5.61e-7 + 2.03e-6 + 2.84e-6 + 1.47e-6 + 2.87e-7 + 1.53e-8 = 7.02e-6\n\nSo, the probability that John, Abby, and David all get the same mark in their next math test is approximately 0.00000702 or 0.000702%."
