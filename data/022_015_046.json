    "message_2": "To find the image of a point under reflection about the line $\\text{Re}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}$, we can use the following formula for reflection:\n\n$$z' = \\frac{1}{2} + (\\frac{1}{2} - \\text{Re}(z)) + i\\text{Im}(z)$$\n\nLet's find the image of the point $1+i$:\n\n$$z_1' = \\frac{1}{2} + (\\frac{1}{2} - 1) + i(1) = 0 + i$$\n\nSo, the image of the point $1+i$ is $0+i$.\n\nNow, let's find the image of the point $2+i$:\n\n$$z_2' = \\frac{1}{2} + (\\frac{1}{2} - 2) + i(1) = -1 + i$$\n\nSo, the image of the point $2+i$ is $-1+i$.\n\nThus, the images of the points $1+i$ and $2+i$ under the reflection about the line $\\text{Re}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}$ are $0+i$ and $-1+i$, respectively."
