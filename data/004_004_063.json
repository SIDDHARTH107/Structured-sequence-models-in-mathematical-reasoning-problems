    "message_1": "A ramp has a length of 20 meters and a height of 5 meters. What is the area under the curve formed by the ramp, from the starting point to the ending point, if the curve is modeled by the equation y = 5x/20?",
    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve, we need to integrate the function y = 5x/20 with respect to x, from the starting point (x = 0) to the ending point (x = 20).\n\nThe function y = 5x/20 can be simplified to y = x/4.\n\nNow, let's integrate:\n\nâˆ«(x/4) dx from 0 to 20\n\nThe antiderivative of x/4 is (1/8)x^2. Now, we'll evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds:\n\n(1/8)(20^2) - (1/8)(0^2) = (1/8)(400) - 0 = 50\n\nSo, the area under the curve is 50 square meters."
