    "message_2": "(a) To write the second-order sentence $\\psi$ that asserts that there exists an odd number that satisfies $\\varphi(x)$, we can write:\n\n$\\psi$ := \"there exists a natural number $y$ such that $y$ is odd and $\\varphi(y)$ holds.\"\n\nIn more formal notation, we can write:\n\n$\\psi$ := $\\exists y \\in \\mathbb{N} \\, (\\, (\\exists k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\, (y = 2k + 1)) \\, \\land \\, \\varphi(y) \\,)$\n\n(b) To determine if $\\psi$ is true or false on $\\mathbb{N}$, let's analyze the properties of the set $S$ in $\\varphi(x)$.\n\nRecall that $\\varphi(x)$ := \"there exists a set $S$ of natural numbers containing $x$ and every element in $S$ is divisible by 2.\"\n\nNow, suppose there exists an odd number $y$ that satisfies $\\varphi(y)$. This means that there is a set $S$ of natural numbers containing $y$ and every element in $S$ is divisible by 2. However, this leads to a contradiction, because an odd number cannot be divisible by 2.\n\nSince we have a contradiction, there cannot exist an odd number that satisfies $\\varphi(x)$. Therefore, $\\psi$ is false on $\\mathbb{N}$."
