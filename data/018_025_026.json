    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nSo, A △ B = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection.\n\n(A △ B) ∩ B = {1, 3, 6, 8} ∩ {2, 4, 6, 8} = {6, 8}\n\nSince the symmetric difference is commutative, we have:\n\nB △ A = A △ B = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find (B △ A) ∩ B:\n\n(B △ A) ∩ B = {1, 3, 6, 8} ∩ {2, 4, 6, 8} = {6, 8}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) ∩ B = {6, 8} and (B △ A) ∩ B = {6, 8}. Therefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection, contrary to the original statement. In other words, (A △ B) ∩ B = (B △ A) ∩ B."
