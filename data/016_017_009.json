    "message_2": "The perimeter of a Heighway Dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial segment length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1, and we want to find the perimeter after 10 iterations. So, we have:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^10)\n\nPerimeter = 1 * 1024\n\nPerimeter = 1024\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024."
