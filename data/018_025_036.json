    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {2, 3, 4, 7}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B and then find the intersection of A and the resulting set. Next, find the symmetric difference of B and A and then find the intersection of B and the resulting set. Show that the two intersection sets are not equal, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
