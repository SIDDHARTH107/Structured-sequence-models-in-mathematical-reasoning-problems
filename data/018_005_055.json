    "message_2": "The intersection of a set A and its complement, denoted as A ∩ A', is the set of elements that are common to both A and A'. Since the complement of a set A contains all the elements that are not in A, there are no common elements between A and its complement. Therefore, the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set, denoted as ∅."
