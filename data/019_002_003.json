    "message_2": "To prove the statement using predicate logic, let's first define our predicates:\n\nP(x, y, n) = \"x > y + 1/n\"\n\nWe want to prove that for any real numbers x and y, if x > y, then there exists a positive integer n such that P(x, y, n) is true. In predicate logic, this can be written as:\n\n∀x, y ∈ ℝ (x > y → ∃n ∈ ℕ (P(x, y, n)))\n\nProof:\n\nAssume x > y for some real numbers x and y. We want to show that there exists a positive integer n such that P(x, y, n) is true.\n\nLet d = x - y, so d > 0 (since x > y). Now, consider the Archimedean property of real numbers, which states that for any positive real number d, there exists a positive integer n such that 1/n < d.\n\nSo, there exists a positive integer n such that 1/n < d. Then, we can write:\n\n1/n < d\n1/n < x - y\ny + 1/n < x\n\nThus, P(x, y, n) is true for some positive integer n. Therefore, the statement is true for all real numbers x and y.\n\nNow, let's find the smallest positive integer n for which x > y + 1/n is true when x = 10 and y = 5.\n\nWe have:\n\n10 > 5 + 1/n\n5 > 1/n\n\nWe want to find the smallest positive integer n such that 1/n < 5. We can start by trying n = 1:\n\n1/1 = 1 < 5\n\nHowever, we want the smallest n, so let's try n = 2:\n\n1/2 = 0.5 < 5\n\nWe can keep increasing n to find a smaller value:\n\n1/3 ≈ 0.33 < 5\n1/4 = 0.25 < 5\n1/5 = 0.2 < 5\n1/6 ≈ 0.1667 < 5\n\nNow, if we try n = 7:\n\n1/7 ≈ 0.1429 < 5\n\nSince 1/7 is the smallest value of 1/n that is still less than 5, the smallest positive integer n for which x > y + 1/n is true when x = 10 and y = 5 is n = 7."
