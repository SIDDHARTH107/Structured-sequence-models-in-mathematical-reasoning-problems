    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 - y^2 = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 - y^2. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = -2y\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n-2y = 0 => y = 0\n\nSo, the only point where both partial derivatives are zero is (x, y) = (0, 0). However, we also need to check if this point is a singular point or a smooth point. To do this, we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\nH(f) = | ∂^2f/∂x^2  ∂^2f/∂x∂y |\n           | ∂^2f/∂y∂x  ∂^2f/∂y^2 |\n\nH(f) = | 6x  0  |\n           |  0  -2 |\n\nAt the point (0, 0), the Hessian matrix becomes:\n\nH(f) = | 0  0 |\n           | 0 -2 |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is 0, which means that the point (0, 0) is a singular point on the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 - y^2 = 0."
