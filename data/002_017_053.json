    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by 6 (since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe side length of each equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon, which is 7 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side^2 * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length of 7 cm:\n\nArea = (7^2 * √3) / 4\nArea = (49 * √3) / 4\nArea ≈ 21.217 cm²\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one equilateral triangle by 6 to find the area of the hexagon:\n\nHexagon area ≈ 21.217 cm² * 6\nHexagon area ≈ 127.302 cm²\n\nThe area of the regular hexagon is approximately 127.302 cm²."
