If a random sample of 25 chocolate bars is selected, what is the probability that the average weight of the sample will be less than 98 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. In this case, we have a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 100 grams and a standard deviation (σ) of 5 grams.\n\nSince we are taking a random sample of 25 chocolate bars, the sample size (n) is 25. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be equal to the population mean (μ), and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean) will be equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n):\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nIn this case:\n\nσ_sample_mean = 5 / √25 = 5 / 5 = 1\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the average weight of the sample (X̄) will be less than 98 grams. To do this, we will calculate the z-score, which represents the number of standard deviations an observation is away from the mean:\n\nz = (X̄ - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nIn this case:\n\nz = (98 - 100) / 1 = -2\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2. Looking up -2 in the z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.0228, or 2.28%.\n\nSo, there is a 2.28% probability that the average weight of the sample of 25 chocolate bars will be less than 98 grams."
