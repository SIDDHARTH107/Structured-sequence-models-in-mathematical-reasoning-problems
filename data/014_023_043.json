    "message_2": "First, let's perform the encryption using the Rail Fence cipher with a key of 3.\n\n1. Write down the plaintext in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nM   E   A   I   S\n A T M T C S F N\n  T   I   U\n\n2. Read the ciphertext from left to right, top to bottom:\n\nCiphertext: MEAISATMTCSFNTIU\n\nNow, let's decrypt the given ciphertext \"MHMEAASFTITCU ISN\" using the Rail Fence cipher with a key of 3.\n\n1. Determine the length of each row:\n\nRow 1: 5 characters (MHMEA)\nRow 2: 7 characters (ASFTITC)\nRow 3: 4 characters (U ISN)\n\n2. Write down the ciphertext in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nM   H   M   E   A\n A S F T I T C U\n  I   S   N\n\n3. Read the plaintext from left to right, following the zigzag pattern:\n\nPlaintext: MATHEMATICS IS FUN\n\nSo, the plaintext obtained after decryption is \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\"."
