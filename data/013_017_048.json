Policy B has a monthly premium of $250 and covers a deductible of $500.\n\nAssume that 60% of the people who buy insurance have a low risk of getting into an accident and 40% have a high risk. Low risk individuals have a 20% chance of getting into an accident and high-risk individuals have a 50% chance of getting into an accident.\n\nWhat is the expected monthly profit for the insurance company if it sells:\n\n1. Only Policy A to its customers\n2. Only Policy B to its customers\n3. Offers both Policy A and Policy B and allows customers to choose which one to purchase.",

Only Policy A to its customers:\n\nFor low risk individuals (60%):\nPremium: $150\nChance of accident: 20%\nDeductible: $1000\nExpected payout: 0.2 * $1000 = $200\n\nFor high risk individuals (40%):\nPremium: $150\nChance of accident: 50%\nDeductible: $1000\nExpected payout: 0.5 * $1000 = $500\n\nTotal expected profit for Policy A:\nLow risk: (60%)($150 - $200) = -$30\nHigh risk: (40%)($150 - $500) = -$140\nTotal expected profit for Policy A: -$30 + (-$140) = -$170\n\n2. Only Policy B to its customers:\n\nFor low risk individuals (60%):\nPremium: $250\nChance of accident: 20%\nDeductible: $500\nExpected payout: 0.2 * $500 = $100\n\nFor high risk individuals (40%):\nPremium: $250\nChance of accident: 50%\nDeductible: $500\nExpected payout: 0.5 * $500 = $250\n\nTotal expected profit for Policy B:\nLow risk: (60%)($250 - $100) = $90\nHigh risk: (40%)($250 - $250) = $0\nTotal expected profit for Policy B: $90 + $0 = $90\n\n3.

If it offers both policies and allows customers to choose, the expected monthly profit would be -$30. Selling only Policy A would result in a negative expected monthly profit of -$170."
