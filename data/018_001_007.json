    "message_2": "To verify whether the empty set D is a subset of sets A, B, and C, we need to check if every element in D is also an element in A, B, and C.\n\nBy definition, the empty set D has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in D that are not in A, B, or C. \n\nSo, we can conclude that the empty set D is a subset of sets A, B, and C. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nD ⊆ A\nD ⊆ B\nD ⊆ C"
