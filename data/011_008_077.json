    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are denoted by S(n, k), where n is the number of items and k is the number of non-empty subsets. The Stirling numbers of the second kind count the number of ways to partition a set of n items into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, we want to find S(10, 4). We can use the following recurrence relation for Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can build a table of Stirling numbers of the second kind for n = 1 to 10 and k = 1 to 4:\n\nn\\k | 1       2       3       4\n-------------------------------\n1   | 1       0       0       0\n2   | 0       1       0       0\n3   | 0       3       1       0\n4   | 0       7       6       1\n5   | 0       15      25      10\n6   | 0       31      90      65\n7   | 0       63      301     350\n8   | 0       127     966     1701\n9   | 0       255     3025    7770\n10  | 0       511     9330    29281\n\nSo, there are 29,281 ways to divide a set of 10 items into 4 non-empty subsets."
