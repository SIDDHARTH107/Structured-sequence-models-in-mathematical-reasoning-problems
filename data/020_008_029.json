The transportation costs per unit for each city are as follows:\n\n- City B: $5\n- City C: $6\n- City D: $8\n\nThe company has a total of 200 units of goods to transport. However, due to limited availability of trucks, it can only transport a maximum of 80 units to city B, 100 units to city C, and 120 to city D. Determine the shipment quantities of goods from city A to cities B, C, and D that minimize the transportation cost for the company.",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z be the number of units transported to cities B, C, and D, respectively. We want to minimize the total transportation cost, which can be represented as:\n\nCost = 5x + 6y + 8z\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y + z = 200 (total units to be transported)\n2. x ≤ 80 (maximum units to city B)\n3. y ≤ 100 (maximum units to city C)\n4. z ≤ 120 (maximum units to city D)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we should first try to transport as many units as possible to the city with the lowest transportation cost, which is city B. So, we transport 80 units to city B (x = 80).\n\nNow we have 200 - 80 = 120 units left to transport. The next lowest transportation cost is for city C, so we transport as many units as possible to city C. Since the maximum allowed is 100 units, we transport 100 units to city C (y = 100).\n\nFinally, we have 120 - 100 = 20 units left to transport. We transport these remaining units to city D (z = 20).\n\nSo, the optimal shipment quantities are:\n- 80 units to city B\n- 100 units to city C\n- 20 units to city D\n\nThe minimum transportation cost can be calculated as:\n\nCost = 5(80) + 6(100) + 8(20) = 400 + 600 + 160 = $1160"
