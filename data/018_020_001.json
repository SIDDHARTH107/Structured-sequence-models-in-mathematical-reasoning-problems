    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A∆B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 4, 6}\n\nIntersection of A and B, A∩B = {2, 4}\n\nA∆B = (A - A∩B) ∪ (B - A∩B) = ({1, 3} ∪ {6}) = {1, 3, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A∆B) and C.\n\n(A∆B) = {1, 3, 6}\nC = {2, 3, 4, 7}\n\nIntersection of (A∆B) and C, (A∆B)∩C = {3}\n\n(A∆B)∆C = ((A∆B) - (A∆B)∩C) ∪ (C - (A∆B)∩C) = ({1, 6} ∪ {2, 4, 7}) = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of (A∆B) and C is distributive over union. The distributive law states that:\n\n(A∆B)∆C = (A∆C)∆(B∆C)\n\nLet's find the symmetric differences A∆C and B∆C:\n\nA∆C = (A - A∩C) ∪ (C - A∩C) = ({1, 2, 4} ∪ {2, 7}) = {1, 2, 4, 7}\nB∆C = (B - B∩C) ∪ (C - B∩C) = ({2, 6} ∪ {3, 7}) = {2, 3, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A∆C) and (B∆C):\n\n(A∆C) = {1, 2, 4, 7}\n(B∆C) = {2, 3, 6, 7}\n\nIntersection of (A∆C) and (B∆C), (A∆C)∩(B∆C) = {2, 7}\n\n(A∆C)∆(B∆C) = ((A∆C) - (A∆C)∩(B∆C)) ∪ ((B∆C) - (A∆C)∩(B∆C)) = ({1, 4} ∪ {3, 6}) = {1, 3, 4, 6}\n\nSince (A∆B)∆C = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} and (A∆C)∆(B∆C) = {1, 3, 4, 6}, the distributive law does not hold in this case. The symmetric difference of (A∆B) and C is not distributive over union."
