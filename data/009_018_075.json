    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n\ndy/dx + y^2 = x\n\nWe can use an integrating factor method. First, rewrite the ODE as:\n\ndy/dx = x - y^2\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation in the form of dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x) to identify P(x) and Q(x):\n\nP(x) = -y^2 and Q(x) = x\n\nThe integrating factor (IF) is given by the formula:\n\nIF = e^(∫P(x)dx)\n\nHowever, we cannot directly integrate P(x) = -y^2 with respect to x. So, we will use a substitution method. Let v = y^2, then dv/dx = 2y(dy/dx). Now, we can rewrite the ODE in terms of v:\n\ndv/dx = 2y(x - y^2)\ndv/dx = 2y(x - v)\n\nNow, we can find the integrating factor for this new equation:\n\nIF = e^(∫(-2y)dx)\n\nSince y is not a function of x, we cannot directly integrate -2y with respect to x. However, we can treat -2y as a constant, say k, and integrate it:\n\nIF = e^(kx)\n\nNow, multiply the equation dv/dx = 2y(x - v) by the integrating factor e^(kx):\n\ne^(kx) * (dv/dx) = 2ye^(kx)(x - v)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of v and e^(kx) with respect to x:\n\nd(v * e^(kx))/dx = 2ye^(kx)(x - v)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫d(v * e^(kx))/dx dx = ∫2ye^(kx)(x - v) dx\n\nv * e^(kx) = ∫2ye^(kx)(x - v) dx + C\n\nNow, substitute back y^2 for v:\n\ny^2 * e^(kx) = ∫2ye^(kx)(x - y^2) dx + C\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot proceed further with the integration, as the integral on the right side is too complex. In this case, the solution to the ODE cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, we can still use numerical methods to find an approximate solution for the given initial condition y(0) = 1."
