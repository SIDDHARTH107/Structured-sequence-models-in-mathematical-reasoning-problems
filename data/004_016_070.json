    "message_1": "A student drove her car from point A to point B in 2 hours. The distance between the points is 120 km. Using the Mean Value Theorem, find the average speed of the car during the trip.",
    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, we have a continuous function (the distance traveled) over the closed interval [0, 2] hours and differentiable on the open interval (0, 2) hours. We want to find the average speed of the car during the trip.\n\nThe average speed is given by the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In this case, the distance traveled is 120 km, and the time taken is 2 hours.\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time)\nAverage speed = 120 km / 2 hours\nAverage speed = 60 km/h\n\nSo, the average speed of the car during the trip is 60 km/h."
