The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B.\n\nFor the element 2:\n2 ∈ A, since A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n2 ∈ B, since B = {2, 4, 6}\n\nFor the element 4:\n4 ∈ A, since A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n4 ∈ B, since B = {2, 4, 6}\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B."
