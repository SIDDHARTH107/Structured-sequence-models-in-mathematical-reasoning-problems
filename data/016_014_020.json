    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-similar fractal, and its Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, at each iteration, the curve is divided into 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 3 (s = 3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension d of the Lévy C curve is:\n\nd = log(4) / log(3) ≈ 1.26186"
