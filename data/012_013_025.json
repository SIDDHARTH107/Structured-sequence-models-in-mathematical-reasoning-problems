Find the chromatic polynomial of G.\n\n```\n    1\n   / \\\n  2---3\n  |   | \n  4   5\n```\n\nNote: The chromatic polynomial represents the number of ways to color the graph using at most k colors, where k is a positive integer.",
    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction method. We will first choose an edge, say the edge connecting vertices 2 and 3, and then perform the deletion and contraction operations.\n\n1. Deletion: Remove the edge between vertices 2 and 3. The resulting graph G' is a tree, and the chromatic polynomial of a tree is k(k-1)^(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 6, so the chromatic polynomial of G' is k(k-1)^5.\n\n2. Contraction: Merge vertices 2 and 3 into a single vertex, say vertex 2', and remove any duplicate edges. The resulting graph G'' is a tree with 5 vertices. The chromatic polynomial of G'' is k(k-1)^(n-1), where n = 5, so the chromatic polynomial of G'' is k(k-1)^4.\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction formula to find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)^5 - k(k-1)^4 = k(k-1)^4[(k-1) - 1] = k(k-1)^4(k-2).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^4(k-2)."
