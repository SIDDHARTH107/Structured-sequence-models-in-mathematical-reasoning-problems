    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the average lifespan of their lightbulbs is at least 1500 hours. A consumer group believes that the lifespan is actually less than that. They take a random sample of 40 lightbulbs and find that the average lifespan of these bulbs is 1400 hours with a standard deviation of 200 hours. At a significance level of 0.05, can the consumer group reject the manufacturer's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average lifespan of the lightbulbs is at least 1500 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average lifespan is less than 1500 hours.\n\nH0: μ ≥ 1500\nH1: μ < 1500\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 40\nSample mean (x̄) = 1400 hours\nSample standard deviation (s) = 200 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (1400 - 1500) / (200 / √40)\nt = -100 / (200 / 6.324)\nt = -100 / 31.62\nt ≈ -3.16\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 39 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ -1.685\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.16) is less than the critical t-value (-1.685), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. At a significance level of 0.05, the consumer group can reject the manufacturer's claim that the average lifespan of their lightbulbs is at least 1500 hours."
