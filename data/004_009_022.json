    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y(x) = (3x² + 4x - 2)(x³ - 2x²) using the product rule, we first need to find the derivatives of the two individual functions:\n\nLet u(x) = 3x² + 4x - 2 and v(x) = x³ - 2x².\n\nNow, find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(3x² + 4x - 2)/dx = 6x + 4\nv'(x) = d(x³ - 2x²)/dx = 3x² - 4x\n\nNow, apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\ny'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\ny'(x) = (6x + 4)(x³ - 2x²) + (3x² + 4x - 2)(3x² - 4x)\n\nNow, expand and simplify:\n\ny'(x) = 6x^4 - 12x^3 + 4x^3 - 8x^2 + 9x^4 - 12x^3 - 12x^3 + 16x^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ny'(x) = 15x^4 - 32x^3 + 8x^2\n\nSo, the derivative of y(x) with respect to x is:\n\ny'(x) = 15x^4 - 32x^3 + 8x^2"
