    "message_2": "To find all possible Cayley tables for groups of order 18, we first need to understand the possible structures of groups of order 18. A group of order 18 has 18 elements, and the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. Therefore, the possible Sylow subgroups are of order 2 and 9.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 9. Similarly, the number of Sylow 9-subgroups (n_9) must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 9. The only possibility for n_9 is 1. \n\nNow, we have the following cases:\n\n1. There is one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 9-subgroup. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow subgroups. The Sylow 9-subgroup is isomorphic to either C_9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C_3 × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). The Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to C_2 (cyclic group of order 2). The semi-direct product of C_9 and C_2 is C_18 (cyclic group of order 18), while the semi-direct product of C_3 × C_3 and C_2 is D_9 (dihedral group of order 18).\n\n2. There are nine Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 9-subgroup. In this case, the group is a non-split extension of the Sylow 9-subgroup by the Sylow 2-subgroup. The Sylow 9-subgroup is isomorphic to either C_9 or C_3 × C_3, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to C_2. The non-split extension of C_9 by C_2 is a non-abelian group of order 18, which is isomorphic to D_9. The non-split extension of C_3 × C_3 by C_2 is also a non-abelian group of order 18, but it is not isomorphic to D_9.\n\nThus, there are three non-isomorphic groups of order 18: C_18, D_9, and a non-abelian group that is not isomorphic to D_9. To find their Cayley tables, we can use the following representations:\n\n1. C_18: The elements are {0, 1, 2, ..., 17}, and the group operation is addition modulo 18.\n2. D_9: The elements are {r^i, sr^i | 0 ≤ i ≤ 8}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The group operation is the composition of symmetries.\n3. The non-abelian group that is not isomorphic to D_9 can be represented as a group of matrices under matrix multiplication. One possible representation is the group of matrices {A^iB^j | 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 2}, where A = ((1, 1), (0, 1)) and B = ((0, -1), (1, -1)).\n\nTo determine which of these tables represent isomorphic groups, we can look at the group properties. C_18 is abelian, while D_9 and the non-abelian group are not. Therefore, C_18 is not isomorphic to the other two groups. D_9 has a unique element of order 2, while the non-abelian group has three elements of order 2. Thus, D_9 is not isomorphic to the non-abelian group. Therefore, all three groups are non-isomorphic."
