    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly applying a specific set of rules to an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the sides of the triangle are divided into two equal parts, and a new equilateral triangle is formed by connecting the midpoints of the original triangle's sides. This process is repeated for each new triangle formed.\n\nThe perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Perimeter * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial perimeter is 12 units, and we want to find the perimeter after 6 iterations.\n\nPerimeter = 12 * (2^6)\nPerimeter = 12 * 64\nPerimeter = 768\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after 6 iterations is 768 units."
