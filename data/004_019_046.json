    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds, we need to first find the first and second derivatives of the position equation s(t) with respect to time t.\n\nThe position equation is given by:\ns(t) = 4t^3 - 3t^2 + 2t + 1\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, which represents the velocity equation:\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(4t^3 - 3t^2 + 2t + 1)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nv(t) = 12t^2 - 6t + 2\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, which represents the acceleration equation:\na(t) = dv/dt = d(12t^2 - 6t + 2)/dt\n\nAgain, using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\na(t) = 24t - 6\n\nNow, we can find the velocity and acceleration at t = 2 seconds by plugging t = 2 into the respective equations:\n\nVelocity at t = 2 seconds:\nv(2) = 12(2)^2 - 6(2) + 2\nv(2) = 12(4) - 12 + 2\nv(2) = 48 - 12 + 2\nv(2) = 38 m/s\n\nAcceleration at t = 2 seconds:\na(2) = 24(2) - 6\na(2) = 48 - 6\na(2) = 42 m/s^2\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 38 m/s, and the acceleration is 42 m/s^2."
