For $p=2$ and $k\\geq 0$, the Floer homology $HF_k(M;\\mathbb{F}_2)$ is computed using mod 2 coefficients. \n\nSuppose $M$ is the Poincaré homology sphere, i.e., $M$ is the unique 3-manifold that is both closed and has the same homology groups as $S^3$. Compute $HF_*(M;\\mathbb{F}_2)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology $HF_*(M;\\mathbb{F}_2)$ of the Poincaré homology sphere $M$, we first need to recall some facts about the Poincaré homology sphere and its properties.\n\nThe Poincaré homology sphere, denoted by $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$, is a closed, oriented 3-manifold with the same homology groups as the 3-sphere $S^3$. It can be constructed as the quotient space of the 3-sphere by a certain finite group action, specifically, the binary icosahedral group.\n\nNow, let's compute the Floer homology $HF_*(M;\\mathbb{F}_2)$. Floer homology is an invariant of closed, oriented 3-manifolds, and it is known to be isomorphic to the reduced singular homology of the manifold with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n\n$$HF_*(M;\\mathbb{F}_2) \\cong \\tilde{H}_*(M;\\mathbb{F}_2).$$\n\nSince $M$ is the Poincaré homology sphere, its homology groups are the same as those of the 3-sphere $S^3$. The reduced singular homology groups of $S^3$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_2$ are given by:\n\n$$\\tilde{H}_0(S^3;\\mathbb{F}_2) = 0,$$\n$$\\tilde{H}_1(S^3;\\mathbb{F}_2) = 0,$$\n$$\\tilde{H}_2(S^3;\\mathbb{F}_2) = 0,$$\n$$\\tilde{H}_3(S^3;\\mathbb{F}_2) = \\mathbb{F}_2.$$\n\nThus, the Floer homology groups of the Poincaré homology sphere with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_2$ are:\n\n$$HF_0(M;\\mathbb{F}_2) = 0,$$\n$$HF_1(M;\\mathbb{F}_2) = 0,$$\n$$HF_2(M;\\mathbb{F}_2) = 0,$$\n$$HF_3(M;\\mathbb{F}_2) = \\mathbb{F}_2.$$"
