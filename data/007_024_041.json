    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer x such that 3^x ≡ 11 (mod 17), we can use trial and error to test different values of x until we find the one that satisfies the equation.\n\n1. For x = 1: 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n2. For x = 2: 3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3. For x = 3: 3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n4. For x = 4: 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n5. For x = 5: 3^5 ≡ 243 ≡ 11 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer x such that 3^x ≡ 11 (mod 17) is x = 5."
