    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet is independent of the number of iterations applied to create it. It is a fractal property that remains constant regardless of the number of times the space-filling curve is applied. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet is:\n\n$d = \\frac{\\log(8)}{\\log(3)} \\approx 1.89279$"
