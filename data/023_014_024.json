Calculate the probability density function for the momentum of the particle by taking the Fourier transform of the wave function.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability density function for the momentum of the particle, we need to compute the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[f(x) * e^(-ikx) dx] from -∞ to ∞\n\nIn our case, f(x) = ψ(x) = Ae^(-α|x|). We will compute the Fourier transform separately for the positive and negative parts of the function, and then add them together.\n\nFor x ≥ 0, ψ(x) = Ae^(-αx), and for x < 0, ψ(x) = Ae^(αx).\n\nLet's compute the Fourier transform for x ≥ 0:\n\nF1(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[Ae^(-αx) * e^(-ikx) dx] from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = e^(-αx), dv = e^(-ikx) dx\ndu = -αe^(-αx) dx, v = (-1/ik) e^(-ikx)\n\nNow, we can compute the integral:\n\nF1(k) = (1/√(2π)) [(-A/ik) e^(-αx - ikx) - ∫(-αA/ik) e^(-αx - ikx) dx] from 0 to ∞\n\nLet's simplify the integral:\n\nF1(k) = (1/√(2π)) [(-A/ik) e^(-αx - ikx) + (αA/ik^2) ∫ e^(-αx - ikx) dx] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining term:\n\nF1(k) = (1/√(2π)) [(-A/ik) e^(-αx - ikx) + (αA/ik^2) (-1/(α + ik)) e^(-αx - ikx)] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, let's compute the limits:\n\nF1(k) = (1/√(2π)) [(αA/ik^2) (-1/(α + ik))]\n\nNow, let's compute the Fourier transform for x < 0:\n\nF2(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[Ae^(αx) * e^(-ikx) dx] from -∞ to 0\n\nThis integral is similar to the previous one, so we can follow the same steps:\n\nF2(k) = (1/√(2π)) [(αA/ik^2) (1/(α - ik))]\n\nNow, we can add F1(k) and F2(k) to get the total Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k) = (1/√(2π)) [(αA/ik^2) (-1/(α + ik) + 1/(α - ik))]\n\nTo find the probability density function for the momentum of the particle, we need to compute the square of the magnitude of the Fourier transform:\n\n|F(k)|^2 = |(1/√(2π))|^2 * |(αA/ik^2) (-1/(α + ik) + 1/(α - ik))|^2\n\n|F(k)|^2 = (1/(2π)) * (α^2A^2/k^4) * (1/(α^2 - k^2))^2\n\nThis is the probability density function for the momentum of the particle."
