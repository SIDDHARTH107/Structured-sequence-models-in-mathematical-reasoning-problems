    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext using RSA encryption, we use the formula:\n\nciphertext = (plaintext^e) mod n\n\nIn this case, the plaintext is the ASCII value of \"A\", which is 65, and the public key is (e, n) = (17, 323). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nciphertext = (65^17) mod 323\n\nCalculating this, we find:\n\nciphertext = 279\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the letter \"A\" with the given public key is 279."
