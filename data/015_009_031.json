    "message_1": "The mathematical formula for calculating the Lyapunov exponent is defined as:\n\nLE = lim n → ∞ (1/n) Σi=1n ln(|df(xi)/dx|)\n\nIf the Lyapunov exponent of a system is found to be -0.5, what does this indicate about the system? Does it exhibit chaotic behavior or not? Justify your answer using the definition of the Lyapunov exponent.",
    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (LE) is a measure of the rate at which nearby trajectories in a dynamical system diverge or converge. It is used to determine the level of chaos in a system. A positive Lyapunov exponent indicates that the system exhibits chaotic behavior, as nearby trajectories diverge exponentially over time. A negative Lyapunov exponent, on the other hand, indicates that the system is stable, as nearby trajectories converge over time.\n\nIn this case, the Lyapunov exponent is found to be -0.5, which is a negative value. This indicates that the system is stable and does not exhibit chaotic behavior. The negative LE value means that nearby trajectories in the system will converge over time, leading to a predictable and non-chaotic behavior."
