    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √(27/16), we will find the square root of both the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\n√27 = √(3^3) = 3√3 (since 27 is 3 raised to the power of 3)\n\n√16 = √(4^2) = 4 (since 16 is 4 raised to the power of 2)\n\nNow, we can write the simplified expression as:\n\n√(27/16) = (3√3)/4"
