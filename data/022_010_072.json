    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series of the function f(z) = z^3 / (z^2 - 1), we first perform partial fraction decomposition. We can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = z^3 / ((z - 1)(z + 1))\n\nNow, we can express f(z) as the sum of two simpler functions:\n\nf(z) = A / (z - 1) + B / (z + 1)\n\nTo find A and B, we clear the denominators:\n\nz^3 = A(z + 1) + B(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in values of z that simplify the equation. Let's start with z = 1:\n\n1 = 2A => A = 1/2\n\nNow, let's try z = -1:\n\n-1 = -2B => B = 1/2\n\nSo, our function can be rewritten as:\n\nf(z) = (1/2) / (z - 1) + (1/2) / (z + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series for each term separately. We want the series to converge on the annulus |z| > 1, so we need to rewrite the terms in a form that converges for |z| > 1. We can do this by factoring out a z term:\n\nf(z) = (1/2) / (z - 1) + (1/2) / (z + 1)\n     = (1/2) * (1 / (1 - (1/z))) + (1/2) * (1 / (1 + (1/z)))\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula to find the Laurent series for each term:\n\n(1/2) * (1 / (1 - (1/z))) = (1/2) * Σ((1/z)^n) for n = 0 to ∞\n(1/2) * (1 / (1 + (1/z))) = (1/2) * Σ((-1/z)^n) for n = 0 to ∞\n\nSo, the Laurent series for f(z) is:\n\nf(z) = (1/2) * Σ((1/z)^n) + (1/2) * Σ((-1/z)^n) for n = 0 to ∞\n\nThis series converges on the annulus |z| > 1, as required."
