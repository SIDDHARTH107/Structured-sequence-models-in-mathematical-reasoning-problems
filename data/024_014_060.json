    "message_2": "To calculate the Lie derivative of V with respect to W, we need to compute the Lie bracket [W, V]. The Lie bracket is defined as:\n\n[W, V] = (W∇)V - (V∇)W\n\nwhere ∇ represents the gradient operator. Let's compute the gradient of V and W:\n\n∇V = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z)\n∇W = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z)\n\nNow, we can compute (W∇)V and (V∇)W:\n\n(W∇)V = (2x∂/∂x + 2y∂/∂y + z∂/∂z)(x^2, 3y^2, xy)\n      = (4x^3, 6y^3, 2x^2y + xyz)\n\n(V∇)W = (x^2∂/∂x + 3y^2∂/∂y + xy∂/∂z)(2x, 2y, z)\n      = (2x^3, 6y^3, 2x^2y + xyz)\n\nNow, we can compute the Lie bracket [W, V]:\n\n[W, V] = (W∇)V - (V∇)W\n      = (4x^3 - 2x^3, 6y^3 - 6y^3, 2x^2y + xyz - 2x^2y - xyz)\n      = (2x^3, 0, 0)\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the Lie derivative at point p = (1,1,1):\n\nLie derivative of V with respect to W at p = (2(1)^3, 0, 0) = (2, 0, 0)"
