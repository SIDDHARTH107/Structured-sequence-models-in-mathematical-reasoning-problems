    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we need to apply the power rule for differentiation:\n\nThe derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 is:\n\nf'(x) = (3 * 2)x^(2-1) + (2 * 1)x^(1-1) = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 at the point x = 2 is 14."
