    "message_1": "A company sells a product with a fixed cost of $500 and a variable cost of $10 per unit. The demand for the product can be modeled by the equation Q = 5000 - 100P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price per unit. Find the optimal price per unit that the company should set in order to maximize their revenue.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price per unit to maximize revenue, we first need to find the revenue function. Revenue (R) is the product of the price per unit (P) and the quantity demanded (Q). We are given the demand function Q = 5000 - 100P. \n\nSo, the revenue function R(P) can be expressed as:\n\nR(P) = P * Q(P)\nR(P) = P * (5000 - 100P)\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function by taking the first derivative with respect to P and setting it equal to 0.\n\nR'(P) = dR(P)/dP = d(P * (5000 - 100P))/dP\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\nR'(P) = (1)*(5000 - 100P) + P*(-100)\nR'(P) = 5000 - 100P - 100P\n\nNow, set R'(P) equal to 0 and solve for P:\n\n0 = 5000 - 200P\n200P = 5000\nP = 5000 / 200\nP = 25\n\nSo, the optimal price per unit that the company should set in order to maximize their revenue is $25."
