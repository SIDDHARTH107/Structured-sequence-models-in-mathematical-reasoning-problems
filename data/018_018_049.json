    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it's the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union and intersection of sets A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nA ∩ B = {3, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference A △ B:\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} - {3, 7} = {1, 5, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference B △ A:\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince union and intersection are commutative, we can use the same values we found earlier:\n\nB △ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} - {3, 7} = {1, 5, 9}\n\nThus, A △ B = B △ A = {1, 5, 9}, and they are equal."
