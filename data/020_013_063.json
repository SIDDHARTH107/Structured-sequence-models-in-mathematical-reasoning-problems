    "message_2": "The interior-point method is an iterative algorithm used to solve linear and nonlinear optimization problems. In this case, we have a linear optimization problem. To apply the interior-point method, we need to convert the problem into a standard form and introduce slack variables to convert the inequalities into equalities.\n\nLet's introduce slack variables s1 and s2:\n\nMaximize: x1 + x2\nSubject to:\n2*x1 + x2 + s1 = 3\nx1 + 2*x2 + s2 = 3\nx1 >= 0, x2 >= 0, s1 >= 0, s2 >= 0\n\nNow, we need to define the barrier function, which is a logarithmic barrier function in this case:\n\nB(x1, x2, s1, s2) = -μ * (ln(s1) + ln(s2)) + x1 + x2\n\nwhere μ is a positive constant.\n\nThe interior-point method consists of solving a sequence of barrier problems with decreasing values of μ. We start with an initial feasible point (x1, x2, s1, s2) and a positive value of μ. Then, we find the optimal solution for the barrier problem and update the value of μ. We repeat this process until the duality gap is small enough.\n\nFor this problem, we can choose an initial feasible point (x1, x2, s1, s2) = (0, 0, 3, 3) and μ = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal solution for the barrier problem:\n\nMaximize: -μ * (ln(s1) + ln(s2)) + x1 + x2\nSubject to:\n2*x1 + x2 + s1 = 3\nx1 + 2*x2 + s2 = 3\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use Newton's method, which requires computing the gradient and Hessian of the barrier function:\n\n∇B(x1, x2, s1, s2) = (-μ/s1, -μ/s2, 1, 1)\nHessian B(x1, x2, s1, s2) = diag(0, 0, μ/s1^2, μ/s2^2)\n\nWe can then apply Newton's method to find the optimal solution for the barrier problem and update the value of μ. We repeat this process until the duality gap is small enough.\n\nAfter several iterations, we obtain the optimal solution (x1, x2) ≈ (1, 1) with an objective value of x1 + x2 ≈ 2. This is the solution to the original semi-definite program using the interior-point method."
