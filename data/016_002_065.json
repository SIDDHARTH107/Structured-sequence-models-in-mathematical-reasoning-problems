    "message_2": "A Koch snowflake is a fractal curve formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and successively adding smaller equilateral triangles on each side. After each iteration, the number of sides of the curve increases, and the length of each side decreases.\n\nLet's denote the initial side length of the equilateral triangle as L0 = 10 units. After the first iteration, each side of the triangle is divided into four segments, each of length L0/3. So, the total number of sides after the first iteration is 3 times the number of sides of the initial triangle, which is 3 * 3 = 9 sides. The length of each side after the first iteration is L1 = L0/3 = 10/3 units.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each side of the curve is again divided into four segments, each of length L1/3. So, the total number of sides after the second iteration is 4 times the number of sides after the first iteration, which is 4 * 9 = 36 sides. The length of each side after the second iteration is L2 = L1/3 = (10/3)/3 = 10/9 units.\n\nAfter the third iteration, each side of the curve is again divided into four segments, each of length L2/3. So, the total number of sides after the third iteration is 4 times the number of sides after the second iteration, which is 4 * 36 = 144 sides. The length of each side after the third iteration is L3 = L2/3 = (10/9)/3 = 10/27 units.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after three iterations, we multiply the number of sides by the length of each side:\n\nPerimeter = (Number of sides) * (Length of each side)\nPerimeter = 144 * (10/27)\nPerimeter = 1440/27\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 53.33 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after three iterations is approximately 53.33 units."
