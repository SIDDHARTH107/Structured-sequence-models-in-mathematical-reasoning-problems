    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x-4| = 6, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero.\n2x - 4 = 6\n\nNow, solve for x:\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative.\n-(2x - 4) = 6\n\nNow, solve for x:\n-2x + 4 = 6\n-2x = 2\nx = -1\n\nSo, the two solutions for the equation |2x-4| = 6 are x = 5 and x = -1."
