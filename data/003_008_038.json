    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 6 meters and 8 meters, with an included angle of 115 degrees. What is the area of the triangle (rounded to the nearest hundredth)?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)ab * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and C is the included angle between them.\n\nIn this case, a = 6 meters, b = 8 meters, and C = 115 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n115 degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 2.007 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)(6)(8) * sin(2.007)\nArea ≈ 24 * sin(2.007)\nArea ≈ 24 * 0.906\nArea ≈ 21.744\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area of the triangle is approximately 21.74 square meters."
