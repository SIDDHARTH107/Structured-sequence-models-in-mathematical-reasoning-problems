    "message_2": "First, let's arrange the data in ascending order: 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 20.\n\n1. Median:\nThe median is the middle value of the data set when it is ordered. Since there are 7 data points, the median is the 4th value.\nMedian = 12\n\n2. Absolute Deviation:\nThe absolute deviation of each data point is the absolute difference between the data point and the median.\n\n|2 - 12| = 10\n|5 - 12| = 7\n|8 - 12| = 4\n|12 - 12| = 0\n|15 - 12| = 3\n|18 - 12| = 6\n|20 - 12| = 8\n\nAbsolute deviations: 10, 7, 4, 0, 3, 6, 8\n\n3. Median Absolute Deviation (MAD):\nTo find the MAD, we first need to find the median of the absolute deviations. Since there are 7 absolute deviations, the median is the 4th value.\n\nFirst, arrange the absolute deviations in ascending order: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10\n\nMedian Absolute Deviation (MAD) = 6\n\n4. Interquartile Range (IQR):\nTo find the IQR, we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) and then subtract Q1 from Q3.\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (not including the median if there is an odd number of data points): 2, 5, 8\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (not including the median if there is an odd number of data points): 15, 18, 20\n\nQ1 (first quartile) = 5\nQ3 (third quartile) = 18\n\nInterquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 = 18 - 5 = 13\n\nIn summary:\n- Median: 12\n- Absolute Deviations: 10, 7, 4, 0, 3, 6, 8\n- Median Absolute Deviation (MAD): 6\n- Interquartile Range (IQR): 13"
