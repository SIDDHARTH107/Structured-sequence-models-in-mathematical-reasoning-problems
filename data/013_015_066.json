    "message_1": "Suppose a company hires an agent to sell their product. The agent's effort level affects the probability of selling the product as follows: \n\n- If the agent puts in low effort, there is a 30% chance of selling the product, resulting in a profit of $20,000 for the company.\n- If the agent puts in high effort, there is 70% chance of selling the product, resulting in a profit of $50,000 for the company.\n\nHowever, the agent incurs a cost of $10,000 if he/she puts in high effort. The agent's utility function is given by U(w) = w - E where w is the agent's wealth and E is the effort cost. \n\nWhat level of effort should the agent choose in order to maximize their expected utility?",
    "message_2": "To determine the level of effort the agent should choose, we need to calculate the expected utility for both low effort and high effort scenarios.\n\n1. Low effort scenario:\n- Probability of selling the product: 30% (0.3)\n- Profit for the company: $20,000\n- Agent's effort cost: $0 (since low effort)\n\nExpected utility for low effort = U(w) = w - E = (0.3 * $20,000) - $0 = $6,000\n\n2. High effort scenario:\n- Probability of selling the product: 70% (0.7)\n- Profit for the company: $50,000\n- Agent's effort cost: $10,000\n\nExpected utility for high effort = U(w) = w - E = (0.7 * $50,000) - $10,000 = $35,000 - $10,000 = $25,000\n\nComparing the expected utilities:\n- Low effort: $6,000\n- High effort: $25,000\n\nSince the expected utility for high effort ($25,000) is greater than the expected utility for low effort ($6,000), the agent should choose to put in high effort to maximize their expected utility."
