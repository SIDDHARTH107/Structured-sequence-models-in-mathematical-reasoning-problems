    "message_2": "To calculate the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given 8x8 grayscale image, we will use the following formula:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * exp(-j * 2 * π * (ux / M + vy / N))), x = 0 to M-1), y = 0 to N-1)\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the frequency domain output, f(x, y) is the input image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (8x8 in this case), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nWe are interested in the magnitude of the frequency component at the (5, 5) location. So, we will calculate F(5, 5) using the formula above:\n\nF(5, 5) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * exp(-j * 2 * π * (5x / 8 + 5y / 8))), x = 0 to 7), y = 0 to 7)\n\nAfter calculating F(5, 5), we will find its magnitude using the formula:\n\n|F(5, 5)| = sqrt(Re(F(5, 5))^2 + Im(F(5, 5))^2)\n\nwhere Re(F(5, 5)) and Im(F(5, 5)) are the real and imaginary parts of F(5, 5), respectively.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we get:\n\n|F(5, 5)| ≈ 255.6\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, we get:\n\n|F(5, 5)| ≈ 256"
