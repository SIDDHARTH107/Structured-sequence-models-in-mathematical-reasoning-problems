Suppose that G is the subgroup of $SL_3(C)$ generated by the matrices $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Calculate the number of fixed points of the action of G on X.",
    "message_2": "To find the fixed points of the action of G on X, we need to find the points P on the curve X such that AP = P and BP = P for the given matrices A and B.\n\nLet P = [x, y, z] be a point on the curve X. Then, we have the following equations for the action of A and B on P:\n\nAP = [x, y, x+y+z] and BP = [z, y, -x-y].\n\nWe want to find the points P such that AP = P and BP = P. This gives us the following system of equations:\n\n1. x = x\n2. y = y\n3. x+y+z = z\n4. z = x\n5. y = y\n6. -x-y = z\n\nFrom equation 1 and 4, we have x = z. Substituting this into equation 3, we get x+y+x = x, which simplifies to y = -x. Now, substituting x = z and y = -x into equation 6, we get -x-(-x) = x, which simplifies to x = 0. Since x = z, we also have z = 0. Finally, since y = -x, we have y = 0.\n\nThus, the only fixed point of the action of G on X is P = [0, 0, 0]. However, this point does not lie on the curve X, as it does not satisfy the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0.\n\nTherefore, there are no fixed points of the action of G on X. The answer is 0."
