    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 18 = 2 * 3^2, the possible values for n_3 are 1 and 6. \n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this 3-Sylow subgroup, and let g be an element of P with order 3. Then the subgroup generated by g, denoted by <g>, is a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 3, we have <g> = P. \n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/<g>. Since |G| = 18 and |<g>| = 3, we have |G/<g>| = 18/3 = 6. The group of order 6 has two possible isomorphism classes: the cyclic group C6 and the symmetric group S3. If G/<g> is isomorphic to C6, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of <g> and a 2-Sylow subgroup of G, which is isomorphic to C2. Since the semidirect product of C3 and C2 is isomorphic to C6, G is isomorphic to C18 in this case.\n\nIf G/<g> is isomorphic to S3, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of <g> and a 2-Sylow subgroup of G, which is isomorphic to C2. Since the semidirect product of C3 and C2 can be non-abelian, G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 18 in this case. Thus, there exists an element g in G such that g has order 3 and the subgroup generated by g is normal in G, and G/g is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 6.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 6\nIf there are six 3-Sylow subgroups, none of them can be normal in G. However, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Since the order of G is 18 = 2 * 3^2, the only possible value for n_2 is 1. \n\nThus, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let Q be this 2-Sylow subgroup, and let h be an element of Q with order 2. Then the subgroup generated by h, denoted by <h>, is a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of Q is 2, we have <h> = Q.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/<h>. Since |G| = 18 and |<h>| = 2, we have |G/<h>| = 18/2 = 9. The group of order 9 has only one isomorphism class: the cyclic group C9. Therefore, G/<h> is isomorphic to C9. Since G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of <h> and a 3-Sylow subgroup of G, which is isomorphic to C3^2, G is isomorphic to C18 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18, or there exists an element g in G such that g has order 3 and the subgroup generated by g is normal in G, and G/g is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 6."
