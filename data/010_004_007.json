    "message_2": "To determine if the set A = {1/n : n ∈ ℕ} is compact, we need to check if it satisfies the two conditions for compactness: (1) A must be bounded, and (2) A must be closed.\n\n1. Boundedness: A set is bounded if there exists a real number M such that |x| ≤ M for all x in the set. In this case, for all n ∈ ℕ, we have 1/n > 0 and 1/n ≤ 1. Thus, the set A is bounded.\n\n2. Closedness: A set is closed if it contains all its limit points. A limit point of a set is a point such that every open neighborhood around it contains at least one point from the set different from the point itself. In this case, the set A has a limit point at 0, as for any open neighborhood around 0, there exists an n ∈ ℕ such that 1/n is in that neighborhood. However, 0 is not an element of A, since 1/n is never equal to 0 for any n ∈ ℕ.\n\nSince the set A is not closed, it is not compact."
