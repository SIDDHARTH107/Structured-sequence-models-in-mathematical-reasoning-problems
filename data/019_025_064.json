    "message_1": "Here is a problem based on causal logic for a math student: \n\nSuppose that the probability of getting an A in a math class is 0.8, and the probability of studying for more than 10 hours per week is 0.6. If studying for more than 10 hours per week causes a student to get an A with a probability of 0.9, what is the probability of getting an A if a student studies for more than 10 hours per week?",
    "message_2": "The problem states that if a student studies for more than 10 hours per week, they have a probability of 0.9 of getting an A. Therefore, the probability of getting an A if a student studies for more than 10 hours per week is 0.9."
