    "message_1": "A researcher wants to estimate the average survival time of a certain type of heart transplant surgery. The researcher has collected data on 50 patients who have had this surgery and recorded the time (in months) until they either died or had a major heart-related event. The data is as follows: \n\n1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 10, 10, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 15, 15, 15, 15, 17, 17, 19, 19, 19, 20, 20, 20, 21, 23, 24, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 26, 27, 30, 36, 40\n\nWhat is the estimated average survival time (in months) for patients who have had this specific heart transplant surgery? Round your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "To find the estimated average survival time, we need to add up all the survival times and divide by the number of patients (50).\n\n1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 17 + 17 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 21 + 23 + 24 + 24 + 24 + 25 + 25 + 26 + 26 + 27 + 30 + 36 + 40 = 746\n\nNow, divide the sum by the number of patients:\n\n746 / 50 = 14.92\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth, the estimated average survival time is 14.9 months."
