    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit of type A is $10 and for type B it is $15. Each unit of A takes 2 hours for processing while each unit of B takes 3 hours to process. The company has 300 hours of processing time available in a week. What is the optimal production plan that maximizes the total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nThe constraint for the processing time is:\n2x + 3y ≤ 300\n\nTo find the optimal production plan, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraint:\n\ny ≤ (300 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. The vertices are the points where the constraint equation is equal or the points where x or y are equal to 0.\n\n1. When x = 0:\ny ≤ (300 - 2(0)) / 3\ny ≤ 100\n\nSo, one vertex is (0, 100).\n\n2. When y = 0:\n2x ≤ 300\nx ≤ 150\n\nSo, another vertex is (150, 0).\n\n3. When 2x + 3y = 300:\nWe can solve for x and y:\n2x = 300 - 3y\nx = (300 - 3y) / 2\n\nWe can find the value of y when x is an integer:\ny = 100 - (2/3)x\n\nSince x must be a multiple of 3, we can try x = 90:\ny = 100 - (2/3)(90)\ny = 100 - 60\ny = 40\n\nSo, the third vertex is (90, 40).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 100) = 10(0) + 15(100) = $1500\n2. Profit at (150, 0) = 10(150) + 15(0) = $1500\n3. Profit at (90, 40) = 10(90) + 15(40) = $900 + $600 = $1500\n\nAll three vertices yield the same maximum profit of $1500. Therefore, there are multiple optimal production plans that maximize the total profit:\n\n1. Produce 0 units of product A and 100 units of product B.\n2. Produce 150 units of product A and 0 units of product B.\n3. Produce 90 units of product A and 40 units of product B.\n\nAll three of these plans will result in a total profit of $1500."
