    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, it is known that 3% of the products produced have a certain type of defect. If a company produces 5000 of these products, what is the probability that at least 100 of them will have this defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective products from n total products, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of products (in this case, 5000)\n- k is the number of defective products (in this case, we want at least 100)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (in this case, 0.03)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a product not being defective (in this case, 0.97)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at least 100 defective products, we need to find the probability of having 100, 101, 102, ..., 5000 defective products and sum them up. However, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming.\n\nInstead, we can use the complement rule, which states that:\n\nP(at least 100 defective products) = 1 - P(less than 100 defective products)\n\nSo, we need to find the probability of having 0, 1, 2, ..., 99 defective products and subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\nP(at least 100 defective products) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 99\n\nTo calculate this efficiently, we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The normal approximation is valid when np and n(1-p) are both greater than 5, which is true in this case (5000 * 0.03 = 150 and 5000 * 0.97 = 4850).\n\nThe normal approximation uses the following parameters:\n\n- Mean (μ) = np = 5000 * 0.03 = 150\n- Standard deviation (σ) = √(np(1-p)) = √(150 * 0.97) ≈ 12.02\n\nNow, we can standardize the value we want to find the probability for (100 defective products) using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ = (100 - 150) / 12.02 ≈ -4.16\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability of having a z-score less than -4.16:\n\nP(Z < -4.16) ≈ 0.000016\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule:\n\nP(at least 100 defective products) = 1 - P(less than 100 defective products) = 1 - 0.000016 ≈ 0.999984\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 100 defective products is approximately 0.999984, or 99.9984%."
