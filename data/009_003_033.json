    "message_1": "Consider a metal rod 10 cm long at a temperature of 200°C initially. The ambient temperature is 25°C. The thermal conductivity of the metal is 100 W/mK and its cross-section area is 1 cm². Use the heat transfer and diffusion equation to determine the temperature of the rod after 1 minute of cooling, assuming that heat transfer occurs only in one dimension.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material. The thermal diffusivity is related to the thermal conductivity (k), density (ρ), and specific heat capacity (c_p) by the following equation:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c_p)\n\nFirst, we need to find the thermal diffusivity of the metal. However, we are not given the density and specific heat capacity of the metal. We can still proceed by assuming a generic metal with a density of 8000 kg/m³ and a specific heat capacity of 400 J/kgK. These values are typical for metals like steel.\n\nNow, we can calculate the thermal diffusivity:\n\nα = 100 W/mK / (8000 kg/m³ * 400 J/kgK) = 3.125 x 10⁻⁵ m²/s\n\nNext, we need to solve the heat diffusion equation with the given initial and boundary conditions:\n\nInitial condition: T(x, 0) = 200°C for 0 < x < 10 cm\nBoundary conditions: T(0, t) = T(10 cm, t) = 25°C for t > 0\n\nTo solve this partial differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x) * T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat diffusion equation and dividing by T(x, t), we get:\n\n(1/T) * dT/dt = (α/X) * d²X/dx²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Then we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n(1/T) * dT/dt = -λ²\n(α/X) * d²X/dx² = -λ²\n\nSolving the first equation for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = A * e^(-λ²t)\n\nSolving the second equation for X(x), we get:\n\nX(x) = B * sin(λx) + C * cos(λx)\n\nSince the boundary conditions require that X(0) = X(10 cm) = 0, we have:\n\nC = 0\nB * sin(λ * 10 cm) = 0\n\nThe non-trivial solutions for X(x) occur when λ * 10 cm = n * π, where n is a positive integer. Thus, λ_n = n * π / 10 cm for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, the general solution for T(x, t) is a sum of the product of the time and position solutions:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [A_n * e^(-λ_n²αt) * sin(λ_n * x)]\n\nWe can determine the coefficients A_n by applying the initial condition and using the Fourier sine series:\n\nA_n = (2 / 10 cm) * ∫[0, 10 cm] (200°C - 25°C) * sin(λ_n * x) dx\n\nA_n = (2 / 10 cm) * [(200°C - 25°C) / λ_n] * [1 - cos(λ_n * 10 cm)]\n\nSince λ_n * 10 cm = n * π, cos(λ_n * 10 cm) = (-1)^n, and we have:\n\nA_n = (400 / nπ) * [1 - (-1)^n]\n\nFinally, we can write the temperature distribution as:\n\nT(x, t) = 25°C + Σ [A_n * e^(-λ_n²αt) * sin(λ_n * x)]\n\nTo determine the temperature of the rod after 1 minute (60 seconds) of cooling, we can plug in the values of x, t, α, and the first few terms of the series:\n\nT(x, 60 s) ≈ 25°C + Σ [A_n * e^(-λ_n² * 3.125 x 10⁻⁵ m²/s * 60 s) * sin(λ_n * x)]\n\nFor practical purposes, we can truncate the series after a few terms (say, n = 1 to 5) to get a good approximation of the temperature distribution. Note that the temperature will vary along the rod, so you can choose a specific position x to evaluate the temperature at that point after 1 minute of cooling."
