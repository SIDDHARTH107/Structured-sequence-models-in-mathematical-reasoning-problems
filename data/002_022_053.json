    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 8 cm and a minor radius of 4 cm. Find the volume of the torus (in cubic centimeters) using the formula V = π²rR², where r is the minor radius and R is the major radius.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the torus, we will use the given formula: V = π²rR².\n\nHere, the minor radius (r) is 4 cm and the major radius (R) is 8 cm.\n\nV = π²(4)(8²)\nV = π²(4)(64)\nV = π²(256)\n\nNow, we know that π (pi) is approximately 3.14159. So, we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\nV ≈ (3.14159)²(256)\nV ≈ 9.8696(256)\nV ≈ 2526.64\n\nTherefore, the volume of the torus is approximately 2526.64 cubic centimeters."
