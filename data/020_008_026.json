The cost of constructing a direct road between any two cities is given in the table below. Find the minimum cost routing between the four cities that satisfies the connectivity requirement. \n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/2JQIUJN.png)\n\n| Cities | A | B | C | D |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|\n| A      | 0 | 3 | 1 | 5 |\n| B      | 3 | 0 | 1 | 8 |\n| C      | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 |\n| D      | 5 | 8 | 5 | 0 |",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost routing between the four cities, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. Here, we will use Kruskal's algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Sort the edges in ascending order of their weights.\n\nEdge AC: 1\nEdge AB: 3\nEdge BC: 1\nEdge AD: 5\nEdge CD: 5\nEdge BD: 8\n\nStep 2: Start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree (MST) in the sorted order, making sure not to form a cycle.\n\n1. Add edge AC to the MST.\n2. Add edge BC to the MST. (Adding AB would form a cycle with AC)\n3. Add edge AD to the MST. (Adding CD would form a cycle with AC and BC)\n\nThe minimum spanning tree now has the edges AC, BC, and AD.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost of the MST.\n\nCost = AC + BC + AD = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7\n\nThe minimum cost routing between the four cities that satisfies the connectivity requirement is 7."
