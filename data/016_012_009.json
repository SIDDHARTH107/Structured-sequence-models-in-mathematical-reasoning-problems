    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve that can be constructed by dividing a square into nine equal smaller squares and connecting the midpoints of each side of each smaller square. To find the length of the Peano curve, we need to determine the length of the curve in each of the smaller squares and then sum them up.\n\nSince the original square has a side length of 1 unit, each of the smaller squares will have a side length of 1/3 units. In each smaller square, the Peano curve connects the midpoints of each side, forming a continuous path that resembles a \"U\" shape. The length of this path in each smaller square can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. The horizontal segments: There are two horizontal segments, each with a length of half the side of the smaller square, so the total length of the horizontal segments is 2 * (1/3)/2 = 1/3 units.\n\n2. The vertical segments: There are three vertical segments, each with a length equal to the side of the smaller square, so the total length of the vertical segments is 3 * (1/3) = 1 unit.\n\nThe total length of the Peano curve in each smaller square is the sum of the horizontal and vertical segments, which is 1/3 + 1 = 4/3 units.\n\nSince there are nine smaller squares, the total length of the Peano curve in the original square is 9 * (4/3) = 12 units. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, the length of the Peano curve is 12.00 units."
