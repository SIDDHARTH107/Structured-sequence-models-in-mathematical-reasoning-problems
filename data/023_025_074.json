    "message_1": "Consider a steel plate in the shape of a rectangle, with dimensions 2 cm x 3 cm. The temperature distribution on the plate is given by the following function:\n    \n    T(x,y) = 10 cos(πx/2) sin(πy/3)\n\nFind the maximum and minimum temperatures on the plate using Fourier analysis.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum temperatures on the plate, we need to analyze the given function T(x, y) = 10 cos(πx/2) sin(πy/3) over the domain of the plate, which is 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 3.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points of the function by taking the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∂T/∂x = -5π sin(πx/2) sin(πy/3)\n∂T/∂y = 10/3 π cos(πx/2) cos(πy/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n-5π sin(πx/2) sin(πy/3) = 0\n10/3 π cos(πx/2) cos(πy/3) = 0\n\nThe first equation is satisfied when sin(πx/2) = 0 or sin(πy/3) = 0. The second equation is satisfied when cos(πx/2) = 0 or cos(πy/3) = 0.\n\nFor sin(πx/2) = 0, x = 0, 2.\nFor sin(πy/3) = 0, y = 0, 3.\nFor cos(πx/2) = 0, x = 1.\nFor cos(πy/3) = 0, y = 1.5.\n\nNow, we have the following critical points: (0, 0), (0, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (1, 1.5).\n\nLet's evaluate the temperature function at these critical points:\n\nT(0, 0) = 0\nT(0, 3) = 0\nT(2, 0) = 0\nT(2, 3) = 0\nT(1, 1.5) = 10 cos(π/2) sin(π/2) = 10\n\nThe maximum temperature on the plate is 10°C, and the minimum temperature is 0°C."
