    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in May)\n- n choose k is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rainy day) = 0.22\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (non-rainy day) = 0.78\n- n = 31 (days in May)\n- k = 7 (rainy days)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 7) = (31 choose 7) * 0.22^7 * 0.78^(31-7)\n\nFirst, calculate the combinations:\n\n(31 choose 7) = 31! / (7!(31-7)!) = 2035800\n\nNow, calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 7) = 2035800 * 0.22^7 * 0.78^24 â‰ˆ 0.0916\n\nSo, the probability of it raining on exactly 7 days in the month of May in that city is approximately 9.16%."
