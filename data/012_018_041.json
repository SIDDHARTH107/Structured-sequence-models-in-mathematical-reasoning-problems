    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to remove enough edges so that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In the worst case, we have a complete graph, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In a complete graph with n vertices, there are n(n-1)/2 edges.\n\nIn our case, we have 12 vertices, so a complete graph would have 12(12-1)/2 = 66 edges. However, our graph has only 26 edges, so it is not complete. To disconnect the graph, we can try to remove edges from the vertex with the highest degree (i.e., the vertex connected to the most other vertices).\n\nLet's consider a tree structure, which is a connected graph with no cycles. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. In our case, a tree with 12 vertices would have 11 edges. Since our graph has 26 edges, it must have at least one cycle.\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we can focus on breaking the cycle(s). In the worst case, we need to remove one edge from each cycle. Since our graph has 26 edges and a tree with 12 vertices has 11 edges, there must be at least 26 - 11 = 15 cycles in the graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 15."
