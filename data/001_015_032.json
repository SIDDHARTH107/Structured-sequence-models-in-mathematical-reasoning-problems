    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation $2^{x+1} = 32$, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation with the same base\nSince $32$ can be written as a power of $2$, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n$2^{x+1} = 2^5$\n\nStep 2: Equate the exponents\nNow that we have the same base on both sides of the equation, we can equate the exponents:\n\n$x + 1 = 5$\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$x = 5 - 1$\n\n$x = 4$\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation $2^{x+1} = 32$ is $x = 4$."
