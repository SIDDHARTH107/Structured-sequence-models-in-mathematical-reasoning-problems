    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the intersection of this result with B. Finally, find the symmetric difference of B and A and intersect it with A. Is the result the same in both cases? Explain why or why not.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of this result with B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A:\n\nB ∆ A = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of this result with A:\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ A = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1}\n\nThe result is not the same in both cases. In the first case, we have the set {4}, and in the second case, we have the set {1}. This is because the symmetric difference is not commutative when intersecting with one of the original sets (A or B). The order in which we perform the operations affects the final result."
