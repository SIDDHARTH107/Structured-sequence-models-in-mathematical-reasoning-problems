    "message_2": "To determine the automorphism group of a graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges, we need more information about the structure of the graph. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (permutations of the vertices that preserve the edge structure). Different graphs with 7 vertices and 9 edges can have different automorphism groups.\n\nFor example, if the graph is a cycle of length 7 with two additional edges connecting two non-adjacent vertices, its automorphism group will be different from a graph formed by joining two cycles of length 4 and 3 with a single edge.\n\nPlease provide more information about the structure of the graph or a specific example, and then we can determine the automorphism group."
