    "message_2": "The maximum angle difference between the two swinging arms of a double pendulum depends on the initial conditions and the lengths of the two arms. Since the total length of the double pendulum is 1 meter, let's assume that both arms have equal lengths of 0.5 meters each.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the two arms as θ1 and θ2. The initial angle of the first arm is given as 30 degrees (or π/6 radians). The initial angle of the second arm is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact maximum angle difference between the two arms.\n\nHowever, we can provide a general answer. In the worst-case scenario, the second arm would be at its maximum angle difference from the first arm when it is released. This would occur when the second arm is at an angle of -30 degrees (or -π/6 radians) relative to the first arm. In this case, the maximum angle difference between the two arms would be 60 degrees (or π/3 radians).\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified analysis, and the actual dynamics of a double pendulum can be much more complex due to the chaotic nature of its motion."
