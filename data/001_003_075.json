    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same:\n\nEquation 1: Multiply by 1 (no change needed)\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nEquation 2: Multiply by 3\n15x - 3y = 30\n\nNow, we will add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(2x + 3y) + (15x - 3y) = 7 + 30\n2x + 15x = 37\n17x = 37\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\nx = 37 / 17\nx = 2.176470588 (approximately)\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2(2.176470588) + 3y = 7\n4.352941176 + 3y = 7\n\nNow, we will solve for y:\n3y = 7 - 4.352941176\n3y = 2.647058824\ny = 2.647058824 / 3\ny = 0.882352941 (approximately)\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\nx = 2.176470588\ny = 0.882352941"
