    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the gaps between three mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. In this case, we are given three starting circles with radii 1, 2, and 3.\n\nTo find the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of all circles in the construction, we can use Descartes' Circle Theorem, which states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures (reciprocals of radii) k1, k2, k3, and k4, the following equation holds:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 1/2 * (k1 + k2 + k3 - k4)^2\n\nFor the starting circles, we have curvatures k1 = 1, k2 = 1/2, and k3 = 1/3. We can find the curvature k4 of the fourth circle that is tangent to these three circles using the equation:\n\nk4 = k1 + k2 + k3 - 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nk4 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 - 2 * sqrt(1 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/3 + 1/3 * 1)\nk4 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 - 2 * sqrt(1/2 + 1/6 + 1/3)\nk4 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 - 2 * sqrt(1)\nk4 = 1/6\n\nNow, we have four circles with curvatures 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6. The sum of the reciprocals of their radii is:\n\n1/1 + 1/(1/2) + 1/(1/3) + 1/(1/6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12\n\nHowever, the Apollonian gasket construction is an infinite process, and we need to consider all the circles generated. The sum of the reciprocals of the radii of all circles in the construction converges to a constant value, which can be found using the Apollonian Circle Packing Constant:\n\nC = (1 + 2 + 3) * (1 - 1/2^2 - 1/3^2 - 1/6^2)\n\nC = 6 * (1 - 1/4 - 1/9 - 1/36)\n\nC = 6 * (1 - 0.25 - 0.1111 - 0.0278)\n\nC ≈ 6 * (1 - 0.3889)\n\nC ≈ 6 * 0.6111\n\nC ≈ 3.6666\n\nSo, the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of all circles in the Apollonian gasket construction with starting circles of radii 1, 2, and 3 is approximately 3.6666."
