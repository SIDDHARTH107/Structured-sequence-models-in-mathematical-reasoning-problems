    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(θ)\n\nHowever, we don't have the angle θ. To find the angle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then use inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle.\n\nLet's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c. We have:\n\na = 12 cm\nb = 8 cm\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = (12)^2 + (8)^2\nc^2 = 144 + 64\nc^2 = 208\nc = √208\nc ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nNow, we can use the inverse trigonometric function to find the angle θ:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(θ) = b / c\nsin(θ) = 8 / 14.42\nθ = arcsin(8 / 14.42)\nθ ≈ 34.07°\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(θ)\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 8 * sin(34.07°)\nArea ≈ 0.5 * 12 * 8 * 0.564\nArea ≈ 27.072 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 27.072 cm²."
