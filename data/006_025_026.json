    "message_1": "A magician has 8 red cards and 4 black cards in her deck. She shuffles the deck and selects a card at random. What is the probability that the card she selects is a red card?",
    "message_2": "There are a total of 8 red cards and 4 black cards, which makes a total of 12 cards in the deck. To find the probability of selecting a red card, we need to divide the number of red cards by the total number of cards.\n\nProbability of selecting a red card = (Number of red cards) / (Total number of cards) = 8/12\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.\n\n8 รท 4 = 2\n12 รท 4 = 3\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a red card is 2/3 or approximately 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)."
