    "message_1": "Suppose that a principal hires an agent to undertake a task for her. The agent's effort level can be high (h) or low (l). The two effort levels give payoffs as follows:\n\n- Effort level h gives a payoff of 50 if the task is successfully completed and a payoff of 10 if it is not.\n- Effort level l gives a payoff of 40 if the task is successfully completed and a payoff of 20 if it is not.\n\nThe probability of successfully completing the task is 0.7 if the effort level is h and 0.4 if the effort level is l. The principal cannot observe the agent's effort level, but she can observe the outcome of the task (success or failure).\n\nAssume that the agent is risk-neutral and that the principal can design a payment scheme that is linear in the outcome of the task.\n\nThe principal wants to incentivize the agent to choose the high effort level. What payment scheme should she design to achieve this goal? What will be the agent's expected payoff under this scheme?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the payment for a successful task as S and the payment for an unsuccessful task as U. The principal wants to design a payment scheme such that the agent's expected payoff for choosing high effort (h) is greater than the expected payoff for choosing low effort (l).\n\nThe agent's expected payoff for choosing high effort is:\nE(h) = 0.7 * S + 0.3 * U\n\nThe agent's expected payoff for choosing low effort is:\nE(l) = 0.4 * S + 0.6 * U\n\nTo incentivize the agent to choose high effort, we need E(h) > E(l). \n\n0.7 * S + 0.3 * U > 0.4 * S + 0.6 * U\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get:\n\n0.3 * S > 0.3 * U\n\nS > U\n\nThis means that the payment for a successful task (S) must be greater than the payment for an unsuccessful task (U). To minimize the cost for the principal, we can set U to the minimum possible value, which is the agent's payoff for an unsuccessful task when choosing low effort, i.e., U = 20.\n\nNow we need to find the minimum value for S that still incentivizes the agent to choose high effort. To do this, we can set E(h) = E(l) and solve for S:\n\n0.7 * S + 0.3 * 20 = 0.4 * S + 0.6 * 20\n\n0.3 * S = 0.2 * 20\n\nS = 40/0.3\n\nS = 133.33\n\nSince S must be greater than U, the minimum value for S is 133.33. Therefore, the principal should design a payment scheme with S = 133.33 and U = 20.\n\nUnder this payment scheme, the agent's expected payoff for choosing high effort is:\n\nE(h) = 0.7 * 133.33 + 0.3 * 20 = 93.33 + 6 = 99.33\n\nThe agent's expected payoff under this scheme is 99.33."
