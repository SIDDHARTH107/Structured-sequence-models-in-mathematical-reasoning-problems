    "message_2": "To find the price of the call option according to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, we need to use the following formula:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = price of the call option\nS = spot price of the stock = $100\nX = strike price of the option = $105\nr = risk-free rate = 0.02\nT = time-to-maturity = 0.5 (6 months)\nσ = constant volatility = 0.20\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/105) + (0.02 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.5))\nd2 = d1 - 0.20 * sqrt(0.5)\n\nCalculating d1 and d2:\n\nd1 ≈ -0.0349\nd2 ≈ -0.1349\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2) using the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution:\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.4840\nN(d2) ≈ 0.4463\n\nFinally, we can calculate the price of the call option:\n\nC = 100 * 0.4840 - 105 * e^(-0.02 * 0.5) * 0.4463\nC ≈ 48.40 - 103.0091 * 0.4463\nC ≈ 48.40 - 45.98\n\nC ≈ $2.42\n\nSo, the price of the call option according to the Black-Scholes-Merton model is approximately $2.42."
