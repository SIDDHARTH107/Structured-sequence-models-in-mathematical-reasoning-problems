    "message_2": "To find the genus of a graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, we need to modify this formula to find the genus (g) of a non-planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nWe are given that V = 12 and E = 30. We need to find the maximum number of faces (F) that can be formed in a planar graph with 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n\nAccording to the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n30 ≤ 3(12) - 6\n30 ≤ 36 - 6\n30 ≤ 30\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible to form a planar graph with 12 vertices and 30 edges. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 0."
