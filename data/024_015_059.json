    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the math student:\n\nLet $M$ be a 2-dimensional manifold given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 - 3axy = 0$, and let $\\omega = 2x^2y \\, dx + (x^3 - 3axy) \\, dy$ be a differential form on $M$. Compute the exterior derivative $d \\omega$ of $\\omega$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ of the given differential form $\\omega = 2x^2y \\, dx + (x^3 - 3axy) \\, dy$, we need to take the partial derivatives of the coefficients of $dx$ and $dy$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$, and then apply the wedge product.\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2x^2y) = 4xy$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2x^2y) = 2x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 - 3axy) = 3x^2 - 3ay$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^3 - 3axy) = -3ax$\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2x^2y) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 - 3axy)\\right)dx \\wedge dy$\n\n$d\\omega = (2x^2 - (3x^2 - 3ay))dx \\wedge dy$\n\n$d\\omega = (-x^2 + 3ay)dx \\wedge dy$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is $d\\omega = (-x^2 + 3ay)dx \\wedge dy$."
