The half-life of the substance is 10 years. \na) Write the decay equation for this substance.\nb) Find the decay constant for the substance.\nc) How much of the substance will remain after 30 years? \nd) After how many years will only 50 grams remain?",
    "message_2": "a) The decay equation for a radioactive substance is given by the formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the amount of the substance remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount of the substance, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life of the substance.\n\nFor this problem, N0 = 200 grams and T = 10 years. So the decay equation for this substance is:\n\nN(t) = 200 * (1/2)^(t/10)\n\nb) The decay constant (λ) is related to the half-life by the formula:\n\nλ = ln(2) / T\n\nwhere ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2, and T is the half-life.\n\nFor this problem, T = 10 years. So the decay constant is:\n\nλ = ln(2) / 10 ≈ 0.0693 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nc) To find the amount of the substance remaining after 30 years, we can plug t = 30 into the decay equation:\n\nN(30) = 200 * (1/2)^(30/10)\nN(30) = 200 * (1/2)^3\nN(30) = 200 * (1/8)\nN(30) = 25 grams\n\nSo, 25 grams of the substance will remain after 30 years.\n\nd) To find the time it takes for only 50 grams to remain, we can set N(t) = 50 in the decay equation and solve for t:\n\n50 = 200 * (1/2)^(t/10)\n\nDivide both sides by 200:\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(t/10)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.25) = ln((1/2)^(t/10))\n\nUse the property of logarithms that ln(a^b) = b * ln(a):\n\nln(0.25) = (t/10) * ln(1/2)\n\nDivide both sides by ln(1/2):\n\nt/10 = ln(0.25) / ln(1/2)\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 10 to solve for t:\n\nt = 10 * ln(0.25) / ln(1/2) ≈ 20\n\nSo, it will take approximately 20 years for only 50 grams of the substance to remain."
