    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. To find the total length of the Hilbert curve at level 3, we first need to understand its construction and how the length changes with each iteration.\n\nAt level 1, the Hilbert curve is a simple U-shape with 3 segments, each of length 1 unit. So, the total length at level 1 is 3 units.\n\nAt each subsequent level, the curve is constructed by scaling down the previous level's curve, rotating and connecting them. In this process, each segment from the previous level is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/2 the length of the previous level's segments.\n\nSo, at level 2, each of the 3 segments from level 1 is replaced by 4 segments, each of length 1/2, giving a total of 12 segments, each of length 1/2. The total length at level 2 is 12 * (1/2) = 6 units.\n\nAt level 3, each of the 12 segments from level 2 is replaced by 4 segments, each of length 1/4, giving a total of 48 segments, each of length 1/4. The total length at level 3 is 48 * (1/4) = 12 units.\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve at level 3 is 12 units."
