The company has a maximum production capacity of 200 units per day. The profit per unit for product A is $200, for product B is $300, and for product C is $150. However, due to fluctuating demand and supply chain disruptions, the profit per unit for each product can vary by up to 15%. Assume that the true profit per unit for product A follows a uniform distribution on the interval $[170, 230]$ while product B and C follow normal distributions with mean values of $315$ and $135$, respectively, and standard deviations of $20$ and $15$.\n\nDetermine the optimal production quantities for A, B, and C that maximize the expected total daily profit while taking into account the uncertainties in the profit per unit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of expected value. The expected value of a random variable is the long-term average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. In this case, we want to maximize the expected total daily profit.\n\nLet x, y, and z be the number of units produced for products A, B, and C, respectively. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y + z ≤ 200 (maximum production capacity)\n2. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0 (non-negative production quantities)\n\nThe expected profit per unit for product A is the average of the uniform distribution on the interval $[170, 230]$. This can be calculated as:\n\nE(A) = (170 + 230) / 2 = $200\n\nFor products B and C, we use the given mean values as the expected profit per unit:\n\nE(B) = $315\nE(C) = $135\n\nNow, we want to maximize the expected total daily profit, which can be represented as:\n\nTotal Profit = x * E(A) + y * E(B) + z * E(C)\n\nSubstituting the expected profit values, we get:\n\nTotal Profit = 200x + 315y + 135z\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we can use linear programming techniques. However, since the problem is relatively simple, we can also use an intuitive approach.\n\nSince E(B) > E(A) > E(C), it is clear that we should prioritize producing product B to maximize the expected total daily profit. Therefore, we should produce as many units of product B as possible, up to the maximum production capacity. If the maximum production capacity is not reached, we should then produce product A, followed by product C if there is still remaining capacity.\n\nSo, the optimal production quantities are:\n\nx = 0 (product A)\ny = 200 (product B)\nz = 0 (product C)\n\nThe expected total daily profit with these production quantities is:\n\nTotal Profit = 200 * 0 + 315 * 200 + 135 * 0 = $63,000"
