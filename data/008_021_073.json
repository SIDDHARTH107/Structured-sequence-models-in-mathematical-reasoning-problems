    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the variable x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\n2*(x + y + z) = 2*6\n2x + 2y + 2z = 12\n\n(2x - y - 3z) - (2x + 2y + 2z) = -7 - 12\n-3y - 5z = -19 (1)\n\n(3x + 4y + 2z) - 3*(x + y + z) = 16 - 3*6\n3x + 4y + 2z - 3x - 3y - 3z = -2\ny - z = -2 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n-3y - 5z = -19\ny - z = -2\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the second equation by 3 and adding it to the first equation:\n\n3*(y - z) = 3*(-2)\n3y - 3z = -6\n\n(-3y - 5z) + (3y - 3z) = -19 + (-6)\n-8z = -25\n\nNow we can solve for z:\n\nz = -25 / -8\nz = 25/8\n\nNow we can substitute the value of z back into equation (2) to find the value of y:\n\ny - (25/8) = -2\ny = -2 + 25/8\ny = -16/8 + 25/8\ny = 9/8\n\nNow we can substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\nx + (9/8) + (25/8) = 6\nx = 6 - 34/8\nx = 48/8 - 34/8\nx = 14/8\nx = 7/4\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 7/4\ny = 9/8\nz = 25/8"
