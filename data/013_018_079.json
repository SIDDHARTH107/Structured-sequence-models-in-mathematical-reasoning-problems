    "message_1": "Suppose a job candidate can be either of high ability or low ability, with equal probability. A company can offer either a high salary or a low salary. If the candidate is of high ability, the company will profit more from hiring them at a high salary, while if the candidate is of low ability, the company will lose less money by hiring them at a low salary. The candidate knows their own ability, but the company does not. If the company offers the high salary, what is the probability that the candidate is of high ability if they accept the job? Assume the candidate will only accept the job if the offered salary is high, but will reject it if the offered salary is low.",
    "message_2": "Let H denote the event that the candidate has high ability, and L denote the event that the candidate has low ability. Let A denote the event that the candidate accepts the job. We are asked to find the probability P(H|A), which is the probability that the candidate has high ability given that they accepted the job.\n\nAccording to the problem, the candidate will only accept the job if the offered salary is high. So, if the candidate accepts the job, we know that the company offered a high salary.\n\nWe are given that P(H) = P(L) = 1/2, since the candidate can be of high or low ability with equal probability. We also know that P(A|H) = 1, since a high ability candidate will always accept the high salary, and P(A|L) = 0, since a low ability candidate will never accept the high salary.\n\nNow, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|A):\n\nP(H|A) = P(A|H) * P(H) / P(A)\n\nTo find P(A), we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(A) = P(A|H) * P(H) + P(A|L) * P(L) = 1 * (1/2) + 0 * (1/2) = 1/2\n\nNow, we can plug this into the Bayes' theorem formula:\n\nP(H|A) = (1 * (1/2)) / (1/2) = 1\n\nSo, the probability that the candidate is of high ability if they accept the job is 1, or 100%."
