    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent of a dynamical system is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. For the Rössler system, it is not possible to find an analytical expression for the maximum Lyapunov exponent. Instead, it must be computed numerically.\n\nThe Rössler system is defined by the following set of ordinary differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nGiven the parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7, we can compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent using numerical methods such as the Wolf algorithm, Rosenstein's method, or Kantz's method.\n\nThe exact value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent depends on the specific numerical method used and the precision of the computation. However, for the given parameters, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is approximately 0.07. This positive value indicates that the Rössler system exhibits chaotic behavior for these parameter values."
