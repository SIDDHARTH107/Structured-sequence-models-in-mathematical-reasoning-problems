Bob chooses a secret number a=6 and computes A=g^a mod p. Alice chooses a secret number b=9 and computes B=g^b mod p. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to encrypt and decrypt their messages?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to compute A and B.\n\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 5^6 mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 8\n\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 5^9 mod 23\nB = 1953125 mod 23\nB = 2\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using A and B.\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key as:\nkey_A = B^a mod p\nkey_A = 2^6 mod 23\nkey_A = 64 mod 23\nkey_A = 18\n\nBob computes the shared secret key as:\nkey_B = A^b mod p\nkey_B = 8^9 mod 23\nkey_B = 134217728 mod 23\nkey_B = 18\n\nSince key_A and key_B are equal, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to encrypt and decrypt their messages is 18."
