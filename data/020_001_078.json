    "message_1": "A juice company produces two types of drinks: orange and apple juice. The production line can produce a maximum of 5000 gallons per day. The orange juice requires 5 gallons of oranges and 2 gallons of apples to produce 1 gallon of juice, while the apple juice requires 4 gallons of apples and 3 gallons of oranges to produce 1 gallon of juice. The orange juice is sold for $4 per gallon, and the apple juice is sold for $3 per gallon. Determine the maximum profit the juice company can earn per day considering both types of drinks.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of gallons of orange juice produced and y be the number of gallons of apple juice produced.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 5000 (total production capacity)\n2. 5x + 3y ≤ total gallons of oranges available (O)\n3. 2x + 4y ≤ total gallons of apples available (A)\n\nThe profit function to maximize is P(x, y) = 4x + 3y.\n\nWe don't have the values for total gallons of oranges (O) and total gallons of apples (A) available, so we cannot find the exact solution. However, we can set up the linear programming problem:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 4x + 3y\nSubject to:\nx + y ≤ 5000\n5x + 3y ≤ O\n2x + 4y ≤ A\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nOnce the values for O and A are provided, the linear programming problem can be solved using graphical methods or the simplex method to find the maximum profit the juice company can earn per day considering both types of drinks."
