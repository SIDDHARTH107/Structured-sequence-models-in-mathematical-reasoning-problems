    "message_1": "Suppose there are 12 performers in a show, and each performer has a probability of 0.6 of hitting their cue correctly. What is the probability that all 12 performers hit their cues correctly during a given performance?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that all 12 performers hit their cues correctly, we need to multiply the individual probabilities together. Since each performer has a probability of 0.6 of hitting their cue correctly, the probability that all 12 performers hit their cues correctly is:\n\n0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n0.6^12\n\nCalculating this value, we get:\n\n0.6^12 ≈ 0.002176782336\n\nSo, the probability that all 12 performers hit their cues correctly during a given performance is approximately 0.0022 or 0.22%."
