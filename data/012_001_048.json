    "message_2": "Let's denote the original shortest path between node A and node B as P. After increasing the weight of one of the edges in the path by 3, the total weight of path P will be 15 + 3 = 18.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively say that the new shortest path between A and B will have a total weight of 18, as there might be another path between A and B that has a total weight less than 18. To determine the new shortest path between A and B, we would need more information about the graph G and the other paths between A and B."
