    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the energy of the particle in the ground state using the Schrödinger equation. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional potential well is given by:\n\n-ħ²/2m * (d²ψ/dx²) + V(x)ψ = Eψ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ is the wave function, V(x) is the potential energy function, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nSince the potential well is defined as V(x) = 0 for -5 < x < 5 and V(x) = 20 elsewhere, the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n-ħ²/2m * (d²ψ/dx²) = Eψ for -5 < x < 5\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\n(d²ψ/dx²) = -2mE/ħ² * ψ\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution is given by:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE/ħ²).\n\nSince the potential well has infinite walls, the wave function must be zero at the boundaries (x = -5 and x = 5):\n\nψ(-5) = A * sin(-5k) + B * cos(-5k) = 0\nψ(5) = A * sin(5k) + B * cos(5k) = 0\n\nFor the ground state, we want the lowest energy solution, which corresponds to the lowest value of k. This occurs when the sine term is zero at the boundaries:\n\nsin(-5k) = 0 => k = nπ/5, where n is an integer.\n\nFor the ground state, we take the lowest non-zero value of n, which is n = 1:\n\nk = π/5\n\nNow we can write the wave function as:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(πx/5) + B * cos(πx/5)\n\nSince the wave function must be symmetric about the center of the well, we can set B = 0:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(πx/5)\n\nNow we can find the energy E using the relation k = sqrt(2mE/ħ²):\n\nE = ħ²k²/(2m) = ħ²(π/5)²/(2*2) = ħ²π²/(50)\n\nThe energy of the particle in the ground state is:\n\nE = ħ²π²/(50)"
