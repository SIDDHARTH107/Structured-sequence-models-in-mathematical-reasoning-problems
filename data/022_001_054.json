Show that the function given above can be analytically continued to the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1.\nb. Compute the values of f(1/2) and f(2) on the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1 using the analytic continuation for the function f(z).",
    "message_2": "a. To show that the function f(z) = 1/(1+z) can be analytically continued to the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1, we need to find a function that agrees with f(z) on the given domain and is also analytic on the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1.\n\nConsider the function g(z) = 1/(1-z). This function is analytic everywhere except at z = 1, which is outside the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1. Now, let's define a new function h(z) = g(-z) = 1/(1+z). This function h(z) is analytic everywhere except at z = -1, which is outside the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1.\n\nNow, we can see that h(z) = f(z) on the domain -1 < Re(z) < 0. Since h(z) is analytic on the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1, we can conclude that the function f(z) can be analytically continued to the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1 using the function h(z).\n\nb. To compute the values of f(1/2) and f(2) on the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1 using the analytic continuation for the function f(z), we can use the function h(z) = 1/(1+z).\n\nFor z = 1/2, we have:\nh(1/2) = 1/(1 + 1/2) = 1/(3/2) = 2/3\n\nFor z = 2, we have:\nh(2) = 1/(1 + 2) = 1/3\n\nSo, the values of f(1/2) and f(2) on the strip 0 < Re(z) < 1 using the analytic continuation for the function f(z) are 2/3 and 1/3, respectively."
