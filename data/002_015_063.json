    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular garden, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the garden is 12 meters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 12 / 2 = 6 meters\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula to find the circumference:\n\nC = 2 * π * 6\nC ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 6\nC ≈ 37.69908\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circular garden is approximately 37.70 meters."
