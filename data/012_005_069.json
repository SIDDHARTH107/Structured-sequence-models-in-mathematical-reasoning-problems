    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. First, let's find the minimum and maximum possible degrees of the vertices in the graph.\n\nSince there are 7 vertices and 10 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 10) / 7 â‰ˆ 2.86. This means that there must be at least one vertex with a degree of at least 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum possible degree of a vertex. If a vertex has a degree of 6, it means it is connected to all other vertices in the graph. In this case, the diameter would be 1, as any two vertices can be connected through this central vertex.\n\nHowever, if no vertex has a degree of 6, then the maximum possible degree of a vertex is 5. In this case, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 2 or less, as the sum of all degrees is even (2 * 10 = 20).\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario for the diameter of the graph. Suppose there is a vertex A with a degree of 5, and another vertex B with a degree of 2. The remaining 5 vertices have a degree of 3. In this case, the graph could look like a \"star\" with vertex A in the center, connected to all other vertices except B. Vertex B would be connected to two of the vertices connected to A.\n\nIn this configuration, the longest shortest path between any two vertices would be between vertex B and one of the vertices connected to A that is not directly connected to B. The shortest path between these two vertices would be through vertex A, resulting in a path length of 2.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the graph is at most 2."
