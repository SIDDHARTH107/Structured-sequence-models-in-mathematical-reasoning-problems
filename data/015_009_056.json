    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the given system, we first need to find the eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix for the given system is:\n\nJ = | 3  -1 |\n      | 1   2 |\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. To do this, we compute the determinant of (J - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix:\n\ndet(J - λI) = det(| 3-λ  -1   |\n                              |  1    2-λ |)\n\n= (3-λ)(2-λ) - (-1)(1)\n= λ^2 - 5λ + 7\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the characteristic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ + 7 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nλ = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4(1)(7))) / (2*1)\nλ = (5 ± √(25 - 28)) / 2\nλ = (5 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nSince the eigenvalues are complex conjugates, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is the real part of the eigenvalues:\n\nMaximum Lyapunov exponent = Re(λ) = 5/2"
