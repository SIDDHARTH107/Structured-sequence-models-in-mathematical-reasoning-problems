Let the weight of a particular widget be represented by the fuzzy set W, where W(x) is the degree of membership of x in the set. If W(10) = 0.6, W(15) = 1, and W(20) = 0.4, what is the degree of membership of the weight 13.5 in the set W?",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of membership of the weight 13.5 in the set W, we can use linear interpolation between the given points. We have the points (10, 0.6), (15, 1), and (20, 0.4). Since 13.5 is between 10 and 15, we will interpolate between these two points.\n\nLet x1 = 10, y1 = 0.6, x2 = 15, and y2 = 1. We want to find the degree of membership (y) at x = 13.5.\n\nUsing the formula for linear interpolation:\n\ny = y1 + (x - x1) * (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\ny = 0.6 + (13.5 - 10) * (1 - 0.6) / (15 - 10)\n\ny = 0.6 + 3.5 * 0.4 / 5\n\ny = 0.6 + 1.4\n\ny = 2\n\nHowever, since the degree of membership cannot be greater than 1, we will set the degree of membership for the weight 13.5 to be 1.\n\nSo, W(13.5) = 1."
