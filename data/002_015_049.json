    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (also known as the circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius of 6 cm, we can plug in the values:\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 6\nC ≈ 37.69908\n\nSo, the perimeter of the circle is approximately 37.7 cm."
