    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. Two groups are isomorphic if and only if their Sylow subgroups are isomorphic.\n\nThe order of a group G of order 36 can be written as 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. Therefore, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 4 and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 9.\n\nWe will first determine the possible structures of P and Q.\n\nFor P, there are two possibilities:\n1. P is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_4 of order 4.\n2. P is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V_4, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2.\n\nFor Q, there is only one possibility:\n1. Q is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_9 of order 9.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the structures of P and Q.\n\nCase 1: P is isomorphic to C_4 and Q is isomorphic to C_9.\nIn this case, there are two possibilities for G:\n1. G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C_4 × C_9.\n2. G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is denoted as C_4 ⋊ C_9.\n\nCase 2: P is isomorphic to V_4 and Q is isomorphic to C_9.\nIn this case, there are three possibilities for G:\n1. G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is V_4 × C_9.\n2. G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is denoted as V_4 ⋊ C_9.\n3. G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q with a different action, which is denoted as V_4 ⋊' C_9.\n\nIn total, we have found 5 possible non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. C_4 × C_9\n2. C_4 ⋊ C_9\n3. V_4 × C_9\n4. V_4 ⋊ C_9\n5. V_4 ⋊' C_9\n\nTo prove that these groups are not isomorphic, we can use the following invariants:\n\n1. The number of elements of a given order.\n2. The center of the group.\n\nFor example, the center of C_4 × C_9 is the entire group, while the center of C_4 ⋊ C_9 is a subgroup of order 3. Since the centers have different orders, these two groups are not isomorphic.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that the other groups have different invariants, proving that they are not isomorphic to each other."
