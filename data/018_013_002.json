The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A × B) and C, denoted as (A × B) ∪ C. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\n(A × B) ∪ C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 5, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the union of sets B and C, denoted as B ∪ C.\n\nB ∪ C = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of sets A and (B ∪ C), denoted as A × (B ∪ C).\n\nA × (B ∪ C) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ C ≠ A × (B ∪ C) since:\n\n{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 5, 6} ≠ {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)}\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
