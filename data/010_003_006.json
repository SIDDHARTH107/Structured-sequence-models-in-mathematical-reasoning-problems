If A, B are disjoint closed subsets of X, prove that there exist disjoint open subsets U, V of X such that A is a subset of U and B is a subset of V. \n\nNow, suppose X is a topological space such that every singleton set {x} is a closed subset of X with X = [0, 1]. Show that there exists a continuous function f: X -> R such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. Determine if f is unique or not.",
    "message_2": "First, let's prove that there exist disjoint open subsets U, V of X such that A is a subset of U and B is a subset of V.\n\nSince A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X, their union A ∪ B is also closed. Let C = X \\ (A ∪ B), which is the complement of A ∪ B in X. Since A ∪ B is closed, C is an open subset of X.\n\nNow, for each x in A, we know that {x} is closed, so its complement U_x = X \\ {x} is open. Since x is not in B (because A and B are disjoint), we have B ⊆ U_x. Similarly, for each y in B, we have A ⊆ V_y = X \\ {y}. \n\nConsider the collection of open sets {U_x} for all x in A and {V_y} for all y in B. For each x in A, there exists an open set U_x containing x such that B ⊆ U_x. Similarly, for each y in B, there exists an open set V_y containing y such that A ⊆ V_y. \n\nNow, let U = ⋂ {U_x | x in A} and V = ⋂ {V_y | y in B}. Since the intersection of open sets is open, U and V are open subsets of X. Moreover, A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅ because for any x in A and y in B, x is not in V_y and y is not in U_x. Thus, we have found disjoint open subsets U and V of X such that A is a subset of U and B is a subset of V.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where X = [0, 1] and every singleton set {x} is a closed subset of X. We want to show that there exists a continuous function f: X -> R such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1.\n\nConsider the function f(x) = x for all x in [0, 1]. This function is continuous on [0, 1], and f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. Thus, we have found a continuous function f: X -> R with the desired properties.\n\nTo determine if f is unique, suppose there exists another continuous function g: X -> R such that g(0) = 0 and g(1) = 1. We will show that f and g must be equal.\n\nSince g is continuous on the compact interval [0, 1], it is uniformly continuous. Let ε > 0 be given. There exists δ > 0 such that for all x, y in [0, 1], if |x - y| < δ, then |g(x) - g(y)| < ε. Choose x, y in [0, 1] such that |x - y| < δ. Then, |f(x) - f(y)| = |x - y| < δ, so |g(x) - g(y)| < ε. Since ε > 0 was arbitrary, we have |f(x) - g(x)| = 0 for all x in [0, 1], which implies f(x) = g(x) for all x in [0, 1]. Thus, f and g are equal, and the continuous function f: X -> R with the desired properties is unique."
