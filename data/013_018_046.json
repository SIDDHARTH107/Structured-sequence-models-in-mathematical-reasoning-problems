    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players, A and B, playing a signaling game. Player A has two possible types: type 1 with probability 0.5 and type 2 with probability 0.5. Player B cannot observe A's type, but receives a noisy signal about it. Specifically, if A is type 1, B receives a signal \"good\" with probability 0.6 and \"bad\" with probability 0.4. If A is type 2, B receives a \"good\" signal with probability 0.2 and \"bad\" with probability 0.8.\n\nIf B receives a signal \"good\", what is the probability that A is type 1?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that A is type 1 given that B receives a \"good\" signal, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:\n\nP(A is type 1 | B receives \"good\") = (P(B receives \"good\" | A is type 1) * P(A is type 1)) / P(B receives \"good\")\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- P(A is type 1) = 0.5\n- P(A is type 2) = 0.5\n- P(B receives \"good\" | A is type 1) = 0.6\n- P(B receives \"bad\" | A is type 1) = 0.4\n- P(B receives \"good\" | A is type 2) = 0.2\n- P(B receives \"bad\" | A is type 2) = 0.8\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of B receiving a \"good\" signal, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\nP(B receives \"good\") = P(B receives \"good\" | A is type 1) * P(A is type 1) + P(B receives \"good\" | A is type 2) * P(A is type 2)\nP(B receives \"good\") = (0.6 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.3 + 0.1 = 0.4\n\nNow we can apply Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A is type 1 | B receives \"good\") = (0.6 * 0.5) / 0.4 = 0.3 / 0.4 = 0.75\n\nSo, if B receives a signal \"good\", the probability that A is type 1 is 0.75."
