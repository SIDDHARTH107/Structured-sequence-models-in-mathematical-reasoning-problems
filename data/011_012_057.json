    "message_2": "To find the number of students who do not like either combinatorics or algebra, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal students liking combinatorics or algebra = (students liking combinatorics) + (students liking algebra) - (students liking both)\n\nTotal students liking combinatorics or algebra = 20 + 30 - 10 = 40\n\nNow, subtract this number from the total number of students in the math club to find the number of students who do not like either combinatorics or algebra:\n\n50 - 40 = 10\n\nSo, 10 students do not like either combinatorics or algebra."
