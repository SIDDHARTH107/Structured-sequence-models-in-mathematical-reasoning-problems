    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of H are 1, 3, 9, and 27. Since H is not equal to the identity element or G itself, the order of H must be either 3 or 9.\n\nNow, let's prove that H is a normal subgroup of G. We will use the fact that the index of H in G, denoted by [G:H], is the number of distinct left cosets of H in G. Since the order of H divides the order of G, we have [G:H] = |G|/|H|. If |H| = 3, then [G:H] = 27/3 = 9, and if |H| = 9, then [G:H] = 27/9 = 3. In both cases, [G:H] is a power of 3.\n\nNow, we will use the following result: if [G:H] is the smallest prime factor of |G|, then H is a normal subgroup of G. Since 3 is the smallest prime factor of 27, and [G:H] is a power of 3, H must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we will conclude that either G is cyclic or non-abelian. If G is cyclic, then it has a unique subgroup of order 9 (since 9 is the only divisor of 27 that is not equal to 1 or 27). In this case, H must be this unique subgroup of order 9, and G is cyclic.\n\nOn the other hand, if G is not cyclic, then it must be non-abelian. This is because if G were abelian and not cyclic, then it would be the direct product of its Sylow 3-subgroups, which would imply that G has a unique subgroup of order 9, contradicting the fact that G is not cyclic.\n\nTherefore, either G is cyclic or non-abelian."
