    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). In this case, we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given that one leg (a) has a length of 3 cm, and the hypotenuse (c) has a length of 5 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b). Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n3^2 + b^2 = 5^2\n9 + b^2 = 25\n\nNow, we can solve for b^2:\n\nb^2 = 25 - 9\nb^2 = 16\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find the length of the other leg:\n\nb = âˆš16\nb = 4\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 4 cm."
