    "message_1": "Consider the system of linear equations:\n\n2x + y = 5\n\n10x + 5y = 27\n\nIf the coefficient matrix of this system is ill-conditioned, find the values of x and y using the inverse of the coefficient matrix.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write down the coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix B:\n\nA = | 2  1 |\n    |10  5 |\n\nB = | 5  |\n    | 27 |\n\nTo find the inverse of matrix A, we need to calculate its determinant:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 5) - (1 * 10) = 10 - 10 = 0\n\nSince the determinant of matrix A is 0, the matrix is singular and does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot use the inverse of the coefficient matrix to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nHowever, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (5 times the first equation). This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and it is dependent. We can express y in terms of x from the first equation:\n\ny = 5 - 2x\n\nSo, the solution to this system of linear equations is given by:\n\nx = x\ny = 5 - 2x\n\nwhere x can be any real number."
