    "message_2": "To calculate the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * (distance between parallel sides)\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides measure 7 cm and 12 cm, and the distance between them is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (7 + 12) * 5\n\nArea = (1/2) * (19) * 5\n\nArea = 9.5 * 5\n\nArea = 47.5 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 47.5 square centimeters."
