    "message_2": "When you apply the Fourier transform to a 2D image, you obtain a 2D array of complex values in the frequency domain. The size of this array will be the same as the size of the original image, which is 256 x 256 pixels.\n\nSo, the total number of complex values obtained in the frequency domain will be:\n\n256 x 256 = 65,536 complex values"
