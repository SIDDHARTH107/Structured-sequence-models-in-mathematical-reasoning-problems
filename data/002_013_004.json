    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base width of 6 cm, a base length of 8 cm, and a height of 12 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the base width and base length:\n\nBase Area = Base Width * Base Length\nBase Area = 6 cm * 8 cm\nBase Area = 48 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume using the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\nVolume = (1/3) * 48 cm² * 12 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 576 cm³\nVolume = 192 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 192 cubic centimeters."
