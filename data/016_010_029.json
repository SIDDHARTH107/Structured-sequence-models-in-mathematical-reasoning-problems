    "message_2": "The Apollonian Gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. In this problem, we are given the initial configuration of three mutually tangent circles with curvatures 2, 3, and 4.\n\nLet's denote the curvatures of the three initial circles as k1, k2, and k3. In this case, k1 = 2, k2 = 3, and k3 = 4.\n\nWe can find the curvature of the fourth circle (k4) using Descartes' Circle Theorem, which states that for four mutually tangent circles, the sum of the squares of their curvatures is twice the sum of the squares of the pairwise products of their curvatures:\n\n(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2) = 2 * (k1*k2 + k1*k3 + k2*k3)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + k4^2) = 2 * (2*3 + 2*4 + 3*4)\n(4 + 9 + 16 + k4^2) = 2 * (6 + 8 + 12)\n(29 + k4^2) = 2 * 26\nk4^2 = 52 - 29\nk4^2 = 23\nk4 = sqrt(23)\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the curvatures for the nth iteration of the Apollonian Gasket construction. The sum of the curvatures for the first iteration (n = 1) is:\n\nS1 = k1 + k2 + k3 + k4\nS1 = 2 + 3 + 4 + sqrt(23)\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the number of new circles added is three times the number of new circles added in the previous iteration. Therefore, the number of new circles added in the nth iteration is:\n\nN_n = 3^(n-1)\n\nThe curvatures of the new circles added in each iteration are integer multiples of the initial curvatures. So, the sum of the curvatures of the new circles added in the nth iteration is:\n\nS_n = (k1 + k2 + k3 + k4) * N_n\nS_n = (2 + 3 + 4 + sqrt(23)) * 3^(n-1)\n\nThus, the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the nth iteration of the Apollonian Gasket construction is:\n\nS_n = (9 + sqrt(23)) * 3^(n-1)"
