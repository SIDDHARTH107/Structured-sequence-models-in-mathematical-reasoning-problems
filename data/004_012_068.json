    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (x^2 - 5x + 6) / (x - 2), we can use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if you have a function g(x) = u(x) / v(x), then the derivative g'(x) = (v(x) * u'(x) - u(x) * v'(x)) / (v(x))^2.\n\nIn this case, u(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 and v(x) = x - 2.\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\nu'(x) = 2x - 5\nv'(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\nf'(x) = ((x - 2)(2x - 5) - (x^2 - 5x + 6)(1)) / (x - 2)^2\n\nf'(x) = (2x^2 - 9x + 10 - x^2 + 5x - 6) / (x - 2)^2\n\nf'(x) = (x^2 - 4x + 4) / (x - 2)^2\n\nNow, we can find f'(2):\nf'(2) = (2^2 - 4*2 + 4) / (2 - 2)^2\n\nHowever, we have a problem here: the denominator is 0, which means the derivative is undefined at x = 2. This is because the original function f(x) has a discontinuity at x = 2. Therefore, f'(2) is undefined."
