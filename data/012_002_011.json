    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G, we can use the concept of graph theory called the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph (denoted as Δ(G)), which is the maximum number of edges incident to any vertex in the graph. Since there are 10 vertices and 17 edges, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 17) / 10 = 3.4. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 4.\n\nNow, let's use the upper bound theorem for the chromatic number, which states that the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G) + 1. In our case, this gives us χ(G) ≤ 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nHowever, we want to find the minimum number of colors needed, so we need to check if it's possible to color the graph with 4 colors. Since the graph is not guaranteed to be planar, we cannot directly apply the Four Color Theorem. Instead, we can use Brooks' theorem, which states that for a connected graph G, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G), unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\nSince the graph has 10 vertices and 17 edges, it cannot be a complete graph (which would require 10 * (10 - 1) / 2 = 45 edges) or an odd cycle (which would require an odd number of vertices). Therefore, by Brooks' theorem, we can conclude that the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G is χ(G) = Δ(G) = 4."
