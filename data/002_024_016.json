    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and its parallel sides measure 12 cm and 16 cm respectively. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the shorter parallel side a (12 cm), the longer parallel side b (16 cm), and the height h (8 cm). Let's also call the other two sides c and d.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other two sides. Since the trapezium is not an isosceles trapezium, we need to divide it into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the longer parallel side to the shorter parallel side.\n\nLet's call the length of the base of the smaller right triangle x and the length of the base of the larger right triangle y. Then, x + y = 16 cm (the length of the longer parallel side).\n\nNow, we have two right triangles: one with base x and height 8 cm, and the other with base y and height 8 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the smaller right triangle:\nc^2 = x^2 + h^2\nc^2 = x^2 + 8^2\n\nFor the larger right triangle:\nd^2 = y^2 + h^2\nd^2 = y^2 + 8^2\n\nSince x + y = 16, we can express y in terms of x: y = 16 - x.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the sum of the areas of the two right triangles is equal to the area of the trapezium:\n\n(1/2) * x * 8 + (1/2) * (16 - x) * 8 = (1/2) * (12 + 16) * 8\n\nSolving for x:\n4x + 64 - 4x = 112\n64 = 112\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that the trapezium is actually an isosceles trapezium. In this case, the two non-parallel sides (c and d) are equal in length.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for one of the right triangles formed by the height and half the difference of the parallel sides:\n\nc^2 = d^2 = ((16 - 12)/2)^2 + 8^2\nc^2 = d^2 = (2^2) + (8^2)\nc^2 = d^2 = 4 + 64\nc^2 = d^2 = 68\nc = d = √68\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c + d\nPerimeter = 12 + 16 + √68 + √68\nPerimeter = 28 + 2√68\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 28 + 2√68 cm."
