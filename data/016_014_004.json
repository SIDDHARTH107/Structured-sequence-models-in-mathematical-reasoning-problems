    "message_1": "Suppose a Lévy C curve is drawn with an initial straight line segment of length 1. At each iteration, the straight line segment is replaced by two smaller segments of length 1/sqrt(2) each, at an angle of 45 degrees to the original segment. What is the total length of the curve after 5 iterations?",
    "message_2": "At each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of 2/sqrt(2), since each straight line segment is replaced by two smaller segments of length 1/sqrt(2) each. After 5 iterations, the length of the curve will be multiplied by a factor of (2/sqrt(2))^5.\n\nSo, the total length of the curve after 5 iterations is:\n\n1 * (2/sqrt(2))^5 = 1 * (2^5)/(sqrt(2)^5) = 32/(2^(5/2)) = 32/(2^2.5) = 32/5.65685424949 ≈ 5.65685424949"
