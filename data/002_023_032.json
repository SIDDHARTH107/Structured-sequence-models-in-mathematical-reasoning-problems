    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\nSurface Area = 100π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 314.16 cm^2 (using the value of π ≈ 3.1416)."
