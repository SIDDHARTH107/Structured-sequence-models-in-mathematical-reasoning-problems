    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) consisting of four affine transformations. The scaling ratio for each transformation is as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (f1): Scaling ratio = 0.01 (1%)\n2. Transformation 2 (f2): Scaling ratio = 0.85 (85%)\n3. Transformation 3 (f3): Scaling ratio = 0.2 (20%)\n4. Transformation 4 (f4): Scaling ratio = 0.15 (15%)\n\nAfter the first iteration, the scaling ratio of the Barnsley fern depends on which transformation is applied. The probability of each transformation being applied is:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (f1): Probability = 0.01 (1%)\n2. Transformation 2 (f2): Probability = 0.85 (85%)\n3. Transformation 3 (f3): Probability = 0.07 (7%)\n4. Transformation 4 (f4): Probability = 0.07 (7%)\n\nSo, after the first iteration, the scaling ratio of the Barnsley fern will be one of the four scaling ratios mentioned above, depending on which transformation is applied."
