    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration (level), smaller cubes are removed from the remaining larger cubes. The number of cubes removed at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nCubes removed at level n = 20^n\n\nFor a Menger sponge of level 4, we need to calculate the total number of small cubes remaining after 4 iterations. First, let's find the number of cubes removed at each level:\n\nLevel 1: 20^1 = 20 cubes removed\nLevel 2: 20^2 = 400 cubes removed\nLevel 3: 20^3 = 8,000 cubes removed\nLevel 4: 20^4 = 160,000 cubes removed\n\nNow, let's find the total number of cubes removed after 4 levels:\n\nTotal cubes removed = 20 + 400 + 8,000 + 160,000 = 168,420\n\nThe initial cube (level 0) has 3^3 = 27 small cubes. To find the total number of small cubes remaining in the Menger sponge of level 4, we subtract the total cubes removed from the initial number of cubes:\n\nTotal small cubes remaining = 27 - 168,420 = -168,393\n\nHowever, the result is negative, which means that the Menger sponge of level 4 has more small cubes than the initial cube. This is because the removed cubes are replaced by smaller cubes, and the total number of small cubes increases with each level. To find the total number of small cubes in the Menger sponge of level 4, we need to consider the number of small cubes added at each level:\n\nLevel 1: 20 small cubes added (1 cube removed, replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\nLevel 2: 20^2 * 20 = 8,000 small cubes added (20 cubes removed, each replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\nLevel 3: 20^3 * 20 = 160,000 small cubes added (400 cubes removed, each replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\nLevel 4: 20^4 * 20 = 3,200,000 small cubes added (8,000 cubes removed, each replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\n\nNow, let's find the total number of small cubes in the Menger sponge of level 4:\n\nTotal small cubes = 27 + 20 + 8,000 + 160,000 + 3,200,000 = 3,368,047\n\nSo, there are 3,368,047 small cubes in a Menger sponge of level 4."
