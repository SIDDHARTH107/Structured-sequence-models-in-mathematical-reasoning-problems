    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 5 heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- nCk (read \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting a head) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting a tail) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips), which is 10 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want, which is 5 in this case\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 5) = (10C5) * (0.5^5) * (0.5^(10-5))\n\nFirst, let's calculate 10C5:\n\n10C5 = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 10! / (5!5!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n= 252\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = 252 * (0.5^5) * (0.5^5)\n= 252 * 0.03125 * 0.03125\n= 0.24609375\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 5 heads in 10 coin flips is approximately 0.2461 or 24.61%."
