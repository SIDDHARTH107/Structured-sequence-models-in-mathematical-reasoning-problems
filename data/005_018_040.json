    "message_2": "To find the probability that an individual diagnosed with this disease will survive for more than 5 months after the diagnosis, we need to look at the number of survivors at 5 months and beyond.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that there are 50 survivors at 5 months. However, we need to find the number of survivors beyond 5 months. At 6 months, there are 45 survivors, and at 7 months, there are 40 survivors. At 8 months, there are 35 survivors.\n\nSince we started with 100 individuals, the probability of surviving more than 5 months is the number of survivors beyond 5 months divided by the total number of individuals:\n\nProbability = (Number of survivors beyond 5 months) / (Total number of individuals)\nProbability = (45 + 40 + 35) / 100\n\nNow, we add the number of survivors:\nProbability = 120 / 100\n\nSince the probability cannot be greater than 1, we made a mistake in our calculation. We should not add the survivors at 6, 7, and 8 months, as they are already included in the previous month's survivors. We should only consider the survivors at 5 months and beyond, which is 50.\n\nSo, the correct probability calculation is:\nProbability = (Number of survivors at 5 months) / (Total number of individuals)\nProbability = 50 / 100\n\nProbability = 0.5 or 50%\n\nTherefore, the probability that an individual diagnosed with this disease will survive for more than 5 months after the diagnosis is 50%."
