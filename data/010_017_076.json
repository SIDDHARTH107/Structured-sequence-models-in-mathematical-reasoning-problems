    "message_2": "To use Morse Inequalities, we first need to understand the Betti numbers of the manifold X. For a closed, connected, orientable 2-dimensional manifold with genus g, the Betti numbers are given by:\n\nb_0 = 1 (since X is connected)\nb_1 = 2g (since X has genus g)\nb_2 = 1 (since X is a closed surface)\n\nNow, let f be a Morse function on X, and let m_k denote the number of critical points of index k. Morse Inequalities state that:\n\nm_k ≥ b_k for k = 0, 1, 2\n\nSo, we have:\n\nm_0 ≥ b_0 = 1\nm_1 ≥ b_1 = 2g\nm_2 ≥ b_2 = 1\n\nNow, we want to show that the total number of critical points of f is at least 2g - 1. The total number of critical points is given by the sum m_0 + m_1 + m_2. Using the inequalities above, we have:\n\nm_0 + m_1 + m_2 ≥ 1 + 2g + 1\n\nm_0 + m_1 + m_2 ≥ 2g + 2\n\nSince m_0, m_1, and m_2 are all integers, the smallest possible value for m_0 + m_1 + m_2 that is greater than or equal to 2g + 2 is 2g + 2. Therefore, the number of critical points of a Morse function on X is at least 2g + 2 - 1 = 2g - 1."
