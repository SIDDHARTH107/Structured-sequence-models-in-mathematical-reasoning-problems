    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the boat with respect to the ground, we need to add the velocity of the boat and the velocity of the current as vectors.\n\nLet Vb be the velocity of the boat and Vc be the velocity of the current. We can represent these vectors in terms of their components:\n\nVb_x = 15 * cos(60°) = 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 km/h\nVb_y = 15 * sin(60°) = 15 * (√3/2) = 7.5√3 km/h\n\nVc_x = 5 * cos(120°) = 5 * (-0.5) = -2.5 km/h\nVc_y = 5 * sin(120°) = 5 * (√3/2) = 2.5√3 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the velocity of the boat with respect to the ground by adding the components of Vb and Vc:\n\nVg_x = Vb_x + Vc_x = 7.5 - 2.5 = 5 km/h\nVg_y = Vb_y + Vc_y = 7.5√3 + 2.5√3 = 10√3 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the boat with respect to the ground:\n\nVg = √(Vg_x^2 + Vg_y^2) = √(5^2 + (10√3)^2) = √(25 + 300) = √325 ≈ 18.03 km/h\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Vg_y / Vg_x) = arctan((10√3) / 5) = arctan(2√3) ≈ 71.57°\n\nSo, the velocity of the boat with respect to the ground is approximately 18.03 km/h in the direction of 71.57°."
