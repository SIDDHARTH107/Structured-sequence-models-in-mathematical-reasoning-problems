    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x for x ∈ [-π, π], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0 * x)]dx from -L to L\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * ω_0 * x)]dx from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * ω_0 * x)]dx from -L to L\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function (in this case, L = π), ω_0 = 2π/L, and n is a positive integer.\n\nFirst, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(0 * x)]dx from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[x]dx from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/2)x^2] from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/2)(π^2) - (1/2)(-π^2)]\na_0 = 0\n\nNow, let's compute a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(n * ω_0 * x)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function and cos(nx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(n * ω_0 * x)]dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nTo compute this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx)dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n)cos(nx)\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts, ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n)cos(nx) - ∫(-1/n)cos(nx)dx] from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n)cos(nx) + (1/n^2)sin(nx)] from -π to π\n\nNow, evaluate the expression at the limits:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * {[(π/n)cos(nπ) + (1/n^2)sin(nπ)] - [(-π/n)cos(-nπ) + (1/n^2)sin(-nπ)]}\nb_n = (1/π) * {[(π/n)(-1)^n + 0] - [(-π/n)(-1)^n + 0]}\nb_n = (1/π) * [2(π/n)(-1)^n]\n\nSo, b_n = (2/n)(-1)^n for all n.\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * ω_0 * x) + b_n * sin(n * ω_0 * x)]\nf(x) = 0 + Σ[0 * cos(n * x) + (2/n)(-1)^n * sin(n * x)]\nf(x) = Σ[(2/n)(-1)^n * sin(n * x)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x for x ∈ [-π, π]."
