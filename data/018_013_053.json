    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products and unions for each expression:\n\n1. (A × B) ∪ B\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nNow, we find the union with set B:\n(A × B) ∪ B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 3, 4}\n\n2. A × (B ∪ {5})\nB ∪ {5} = {3, 4, 5}\nNow, we find the Cartesian product with set A:\nA × (B ∪ {5}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\n\n3. (A ∪ B) × B\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nNow, we find the Cartesian product with set B:\n(A ∪ B) × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union. To do this, we need to show that (A × B) ∪ B ≠ A × (B ∪ {5}) ≠ (A ∪ B) × B.\n\n(A × B) ∪ B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 3, 4}\nA × (B ∪ {5}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\n(A ∪ B) × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, the three sets are not equal:\n\n- (A × B) ∪ B has elements 3 and 4, which are not present in the other two sets.\n- A × (B ∪ {5}) has elements (1, 5) and (2, 5), which are not present in the other two sets.\n- (A ∪ B) × B has elements (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 4), which are not present in the other two sets.\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
