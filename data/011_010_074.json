    "message_1": "In a basketball tournament, there are 8 teams competing. If each team plays against each other exactly once, how many matches will be played in total? (Hint: use the Catalan number formula)",
    "message_2": "The hint to use the Catalan number formula is incorrect for this problem. Instead, we will use the combination formula to solve this problem.\n\nIn a basketball tournament with 8 teams, each team plays against each other exactly once. To find the total number of matches, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams (8 in this case) and k is the number of teams in each match (2 in this case).\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\n= 8! / (2!6!)\n= (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n= (8 × 7) / (2 × 1)\n= 56 / 2\n= 28\n\nSo, there will be 28 matches played in total."
