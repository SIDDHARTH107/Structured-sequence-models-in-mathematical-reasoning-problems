    "message_1": "Consider a single-item auction with three bidders. Each bidder has a private valuation for the item they are bidding on, and the valuations are independent and identically distributed random variables evenly distributed between $0$ and $10$. The auction follows a second-price sealed-bid mechanism.\n\nWhat is the expected revenue for the auctioneer, assuming all bidders bid truthfully?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the item and pays the second-highest bid. Since all bidders bid truthfully, their bids are equal to their valuations.\n\nLet X, Y, and Z be the valuations of the three bidders. We want to find the expected value of the second-highest valuation, which is the revenue for the auctioneer.\n\nFirst, we find the probability density function (pdf) of the second-highest valuation. Let W = max(X, Y) and V = max(W, Z). We want to find the pdf of V.\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of X, Y, and Z is given by F(v) = v/10 for 0 ≤ v ≤ 10, since they are uniformly distributed between 0 and 10.\n\nNow, we find the CDF of W:\n\nP(W ≤ w) = P(max(X, Y) ≤ w) = P(X ≤ w, Y ≤ w) = P(X ≤ w) * P(Y ≤ w) = F(w) * F(w) = (w/10)^2\n\nNow, we find the CDF of V:\n\nP(V ≤ v) = P(max(W, Z) ≤ v) = P(W ≤ v, Z ≤ v) = P(W ≤ v) * P(Z ≤ v) = [(v/10)^2] * (v/10)\n\nNow, we find the pdf of V by differentiating the CDF of V with respect to v:\n\nf(v) = d(P(V ≤ v))/dv = d([(v^3)/1000])/dv = (3v^2)/1000\n\nFinally, we find the expected value of V, which is the expected revenue for the auctioneer:\n\nE(V) = ∫[v * f(v) dv] from 0 to 10 = ∫[(3v^3)/1000 dv] from 0 to 10\n\nE(V) = [(v^4)/400] evaluated from 0 to 10 = (10^4)/400 - (0^4)/400 = 10000/400 = 25\n\nSo, the expected revenue for the auctioneer is $25."
