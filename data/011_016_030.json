    "message_1": "A mathematics student is planning to schedule a weekly study session with six of their friends for the next six weeks. Each week, the student wants to study with three of their friends. In how many ways can the student choose three friends to study with each week for the next six weeks?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways the student can choose three friends to study with each week, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (6) and k is the number of friends the student wants to study with each week (3).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\nC(6, 3) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\nC(6, 3) = 720 / (6*6)\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 different ways the student can choose three friends to study with each week.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways the student can choose three friends to study with each week for the next six weeks. Since the choices each week are independent, we can simply multiply the number of choices for each week:\n\nTotal ways = 20^6 = 64,000,000\n\nTherefore, there are 64,000,000 ways the student can choose three friends to study with each week for the next six weeks."
