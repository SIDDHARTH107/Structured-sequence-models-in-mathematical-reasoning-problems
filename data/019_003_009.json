Determine whether the following statements are true or false in S:\n\n1. P ∧ ¬Q is possible\n2. P → ◊Q is possible\n\nNote: ◊ represents modal operator for possibility or \"diamond\".",
    "message_2": "1. P ∧ ¬Q is possible\n\nSince P is true in all possible worlds and Q is true in only one possible world, there must exist at least one possible world where Q is false. In that world, ¬Q is true. Therefore, in that world, P ∧ ¬Q is true, which means P ∧ ¬Q is possible. So, the first statement is true.\n\n2. P → ◊Q is possible\n\nP is true in all possible worlds, and Q is true in at least one possible world. Since Q is true in at least one possible world, ◊Q is true (because ◊Q means that Q is possible). Therefore, in all possible worlds, P → ◊Q is true, which means P → ◊Q is possible. So, the second statement is also true."
