    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, which is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)\n\nwhere (x, y) are the coordinates, (p_x, p_y) are the conjugate momenta, and V(x, y) is the potential energy given by:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (a * x^2 + c * y^2) + b * x^2 * y - 1/3 * c * y^3\n\nFor the given parameters a=1.0, b=-1.5, c=1.0, and energy E=1.5, we have:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) - 1.5 * x^2 * y - 1/3 * y^3\n\nThe maximum value of the potential energy occurs when the total energy E is equal to the potential energy V(x, y), as the kinetic energy (1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2)) must be non-negative. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of V(x, y) such that:\n\n1.5 = V(x, y)\n\nTo find the maximum value of V(x, y), we can take the partial derivatives of V(x, y) with respect to x and y, and set them to zero:\n\n∂V/∂x = x - 3 * x * y = 0\n∂V/∂y = y - 1.5 * x^2 - y^2 = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nx = 0 or y = 1/3\n\nIf x = 0, then y = ±√(3/2). If y = 1/3, then x = ±√(1/3). We can plug these values back into the potential energy equation to find the corresponding potential energy values:\n\nV(0, √(3/2)) = 1/2 (0^2 + (3/2)) - 1.5 * 0^2 * √(3/2) - 1/3 * (3/2)^(3/2) = 3/4\nV(0, -√(3/2)) = 3/4 (same as above)\nV(√(1/3), 1/3) = 1/2 (1/3 + 1/9) - 1.5 * (1/3)^2 * (1/3) - 1/3 * (1/3)^3 = 1/2\nV(-√(1/3), 1/3) = 1/2 (same as above)\n\nSince the maximum potential energy value is 3/4, the maximum value of the potential energy in the Hénon-Heiles system for the given parameters is 3/4 or 0.75."
