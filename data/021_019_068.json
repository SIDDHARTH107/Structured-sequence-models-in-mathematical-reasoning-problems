    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this case, we will use the HS algorithm to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 7 with the constraint x ∈ [-5, 5]. \n\nHere are the basic steps of the HS algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the problem parameters:\n   - Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solution vectors in the harmony memory (e.g., 10)\n   - Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of choosing a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.8)\n   - Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting a value after it has been chosen (e.g., 0.3)\n   - Number of iterations (NI): The number of times the algorithm will iterate (e.g., 1000)\n\n2. Generate the initial harmony memory (HM) by randomly creating HMS solution vectors within the constraint x ∈ [-5, 5].\n\n3. Improvise a new harmony vector (x_new) as follows:\n   - For each decision variable (in this case, x), generate a random number r between 0 and 1.\n   - If r < HMCR, choose a value from the HM for that variable. Otherwise, choose a random value within the constraint.\n   - If r < PAR, adjust the chosen value slightly (e.g., by adding a small random number).\n\n4. Evaluate the fitness of x_new using the objective function f(x).\n\n5. Update the harmony memory:\n   - If x_new has a better fitness than the worst solution in the HM, replace the worst solution with x_new.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for NI iterations.\n\n7. The best solution in the harmony memory is the approximate maximum value of the function.\n\nPlease note that the HS algorithm is a heuristic method, and the quality of the solution depends on the parameter settings and the number of iterations. To obtain a more accurate result, you can try different parameter settings or increase the number of iterations."
