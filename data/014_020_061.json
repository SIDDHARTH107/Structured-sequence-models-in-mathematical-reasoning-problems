    "message_2": "To find the key length of a Vigenère cipher, we can use the length of the repeating ciphertext sequence. In this case, the repeating ciphertext sequence has a length of 20. Since the total length of the ciphertext is 100, this means that the ciphertext repeats itself 5 times (100/20 = 5).\n\nNow, we know that the decrypted plaintext begins with the word \"mathematics\". The length of the word \"mathematics\" is 11. Since the repeating ciphertext sequence has a length of 20, this means that the key length must be a factor of 20 that is greater than or equal to 11.\n\nThe factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. The only factor of 20 that is greater than or equal to 11 is 20 itself. Therefore, the key length of the Vigenère cipher is 20."
