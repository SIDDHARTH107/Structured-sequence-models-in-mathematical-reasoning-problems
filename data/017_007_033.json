    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will first analyze the possible structures of G based on its order, and then construct the Cayley table for each case.\n\nSince G has order 6, by the Sylow theorems, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup. Then |P| = 2 and |Q| = 3. \n\nCase 1: G is cyclic\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩. In this case, G is isomorphic to C6, the cyclic group of order 6. The elements of G can be written as {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5}, where e is the identity element. The Cayley table for C6 is:\n\n```\n   e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5\ne  e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5\ng  g g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5   e\ng^2 g^2 g^3  g^4  g^5   e   g\ng^3 g^3 g^4  g^5   e   g  g^2\ng^4 g^4 g^5   e   g  g^2  g^3\ng^5 g^5  e   g  g^2  g^3  g^4\n```\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic\nIf G is not cyclic, then G cannot be generated by a single element. In this case, we can consider the dihedral group D3, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. D3 has 6 elements: 3 rotations (identity, 120°, and 240°) and 3 reflections. Let r be the 120° rotation and s be a reflection. Then the elements of D3 can be written as {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}. The Cayley table for D3 is:\n\n```\n   e  r  r^2  s  sr  sr^2\ne  e  r  r^2  s  sr  sr^2\nr  r r^2   e  sr^2  s  sr\nr^2 r^2  e   r  sr  sr^2  s\ns  s sr  sr^2  e  r  r^2\nsr sr sr^2  s  r^2  e   r\nsr^2 sr^2  s  sr  r  r^2  e\n```\n\nNow, we have shown that if G is a group of order 6, it can be either cyclic (isomorphic to C6) or non-cyclic (isomorphic to D3). We have also provided the Cayley tables for both cases."
