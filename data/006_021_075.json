    "message_2": "To find the probability of a flood occurring in a given year, we can use the historical data provided. Since the region experiences a flood once every 20 years on average, the probability of a flood occurring in any given year is:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the successful outcome is a flood occurring, and the total number of possible outcomes is the number of years in the given period (20 years).\n\nProbability = 1 (flood) / 20 (years)\n\nProbability = 1/20\n\nAs a decimal, this is:\n\nProbability = 0.05\n\nSo, the probability of a flood occurring in a given year in this region is 0.05, or 5%."
