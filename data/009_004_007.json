    "message_1": "A 10 kg mass is suspended on a spring with a spring constant of 100 N/m. Assume that the air resistance is negligible. If the mass is displaced 2 cm from its equilibrium position and then released, what is the amplitude of the resulting oscillation of the mass in meters? Also, calculate the angular frequency of this oscillation.",
    "message_2": "Since the air resistance is negligible, the oscillation of the mass will be simple harmonic motion. In simple harmonic motion, the amplitude of the oscillation is equal to the initial displacement from the equilibrium position. Therefore, the amplitude of the oscillation is 2 cm, which is equal to 0.02 meters.\n\nTo calculate the angular frequency of the oscillation, we can use the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency, k is the spring constant, and m is the mass.\n\nGiven the spring constant k = 100 N/m and the mass m = 10 kg, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nω = √(100 N/m / 10 kg) = √(10 s^(-2))\n\nω = √10 s^(-1)\n\nTherefore, the angular frequency of the oscillation is √10 s^(-1)."
