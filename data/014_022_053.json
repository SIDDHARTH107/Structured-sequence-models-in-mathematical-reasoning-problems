    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext using the Playfair cipher with key \"MATHS\" and plaintext \"HELLO WORLD\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key:\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS\n2. Complete the matrix with the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher): MATHSBCDEFGIKLNOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nThe matrix looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we need to encrypt the plaintext \"HELLO WORLD\" using the matrix:\n\n1. Break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters): HE LL OW OR LD\n2. If a digraph has the same letter twice, insert an X between them (not needed in this case)\n3. For each digraph, find the corresponding letters in the matrix and apply the Playfair rules:\n\n   - HE: H and E are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if needed): SI\n   - LL: L and L are the same letter, so insert an X between them and re-apply the rules: LX LY -> FQ FY\n   - OW: O and W are in different rows and columns, so replace them with the letters in the same row but in the other letter's column: GT\n   - OR: O and R are in different rows and columns, so replace them with the letters in the same row but in the other letter's column: PN\n   - LD: L and D are in the same column, so replace them with the letters below them (wrap around if needed): YB\n\nThe resulting ciphertext is: SIFQFYGTYPNYB"
