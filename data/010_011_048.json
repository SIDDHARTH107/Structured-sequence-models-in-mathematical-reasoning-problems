    "message_2": "A regular embedding of an orientable surface of genus g into Euclidean 3-space is an embedding where the surface is a closed, connected, and orientable 2-manifold with g handles.\n\nFor an orientable surface of genus 3, we can think of it as a 3-holed torus. The maximum number of distinct regular embeddings of an orientable surface of genus 3 into Euclidean 3-space is 1.\n\nThis is because, topologically, there is only one way to embed an orientable surface of genus 3 into Euclidean 3-space without introducing any self-intersections or singularities. The surface can be deformed and stretched in various ways, but these deformations are considered equivalent as long as the topological structure remains the same."
