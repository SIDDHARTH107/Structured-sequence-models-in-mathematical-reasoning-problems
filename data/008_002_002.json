    "message_2": "To find the inverse of the matrix A, we will use the formula A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\ndet(A) = (3 * 1) - (2 * 2) = 3 - 4 = -1\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of A:\nadj(A) is the matrix obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements.\nadj(A) = [1, -2; -2, 3]\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A) = (1/-1) * [1, -2; -2, 3] = [-1, 2; 2, -3]\n\nNow, let's verify that A * A^(-1) = I:\n\nA * A^(-1) = [3, 2; 2, 1] * [-1, 2; 2, -3]\n\n= [(3 * -1 + 2 * 2), (3 * 2 + 2 * -3); (2 * -1 + 1 * 2), (2 * 2 + 1 * -3)]\n\n= [(-3 + 4), (6 - 6); (-2 + 2), (4 - 3)]\n\n= [1, 0; 0, 1]\n\nSo, A * A^(-1) = I, which verifies that the inverse of A is correct."
