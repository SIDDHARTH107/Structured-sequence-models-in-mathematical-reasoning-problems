    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to solve the equation f(x) = 0:\n\nx^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and we can try to find its factors to solve for x. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nLet's test these possible roots:\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0\nSo, x = 1 is a root, and (x - 1) is a factor.\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the other factors:\n\n(x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6) / (x - 1)\n\nThe result is:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6\n\nNow, we can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the complete factorization of the polynomial is:\n\nf(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nThe x-intercepts are the roots of the equation, which are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to find the value of f(x) when x = 0:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 11(0) - 6 = -6\n\nSo, the y-intercept is at the point (0, -6).\n\nIn summary, the x-intercepts are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3, and the y-intercept is at the point (0, -6)."
