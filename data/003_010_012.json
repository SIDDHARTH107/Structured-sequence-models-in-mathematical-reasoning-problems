    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the displacement.\n\nAt the maximum height, the final velocity (v) of the ball will be 0 m/s (since it momentarily stops before falling back down). The initial velocity (u) is given as 45 m/s. The acceleration (a) is due to gravity, which is -9.8 m/s^2 (negative because it acts downward). The displacement (s) is the height the ball reaches, which is 95 meters.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n0^2 = 45^2 + 2(-9.8)(95)\n\n0 = 2025 - 1862\n\n1862 = 2025\n\nNow, we can use another kinematic equation to find the time it takes to reach the maximum height:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nAgain, the final velocity (v) is 0 m/s, the initial velocity (u) is 45 m/s, and the acceleration (a) is -9.8 m/s^2. We need to find the time (t).\n\n0 = 45 + (-9.8)t\n\n9.8t = 45\n\nt = 45 / 9.8\n\nt â‰ˆ 4.59 seconds\n\nSo, it takes approximately 4.59 seconds for the ball to reach its maximum height."
