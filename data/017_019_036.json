    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. They are:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_36\nThis group has one element of order 36, and it is generated by that element. It is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 36, denoted as Z_36.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 × C_4\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_3 × C_12\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 12. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\n4. Semi-direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 ⋊ C_4\nThis group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18. This group is non-abelian.\n\nThese are the four non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
