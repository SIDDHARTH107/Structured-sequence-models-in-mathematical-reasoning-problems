    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing the central square from each remaining square in the pattern. After each iteration, the number of squares increases by a factor of 8 (since each of the remaining 8 squares is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the central one is removed).\n\nLet's calculate the number of squares after each iteration:\n\nIteration 1: The initial carpet has 9 squares.\nIteration 2: 8 squares are added to each of the 8 remaining squares from the previous iteration, so 8 * 8 = 64 squares.\nIteration 3: 8 squares are added to each of the 64 remaining squares from the previous iteration, so 8 * 64 = 512 squares.\nIteration 4: 8 squares are added to each of the 512 remaining squares from the previous iteration, so 8 * 512 = 4096 squares.\nIteration 5: 8 squares are added to each of the 4096 remaining squares from the previous iteration, so 8 * 4096 = 32768 squares.\n\nSo, after 5 iterations, there are 32,768 squares in the Sierpinski carpet."
