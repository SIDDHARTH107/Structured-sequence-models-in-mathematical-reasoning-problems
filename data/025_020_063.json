    "message_2": "The given equation is an elliptic curve, not a Calabi-Yau variety. Calabi-Yau varieties are higher-dimensional complex manifolds, while elliptic curves are one-dimensional complex manifolds. To find the rational points on the elliptic curve, we can use the method of elliptic curve arithmetic.\n\nThe equation of the elliptic curve is $y^2 = x^3 + 5x - 7$. Let's find a rational point on the curve to start with. By inspection, we can see that $(x, y) = (1, -1)$ is a rational point on the curve, since $(-1)^2 = 1^3 + 5(1) - 7$.\n\nNow we can use the group law for elliptic curves to find other rational points. Given two points $P$ and $Q$ on the curve, we can define their sum $P + Q$ as follows:\n\n1. Draw a line through $P$ and $Q$. This line will intersect the curve at a third point, $R$.\n2. Reflect $R$ across the x-axis to get the point $P + Q$.\n\nIf $P = Q$, we use the tangent line at $P$ instead of the line through $P$ and $Q$. To find the coordinates of the sum, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. If $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$, then the slope of the line through $P$ and $Q$ is $m = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)$.\n2. If $P = Q$, then the slope of the tangent line at $P$ is $m = (3x_1^2 + 5) / (2y_1)$.\n3. The x-coordinate of the sum is $x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2$.\n4. The y-coordinate of the sum is $y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$.\n\nUsing these formulas, we can compute the sum of the point $(1, -1)$ with itself:\n\n1. The slope of the tangent line at $(1, -1)$ is $m = (3(1)^2 + 5) / (2(-1)) = -4$.\n2. The x-coordinate of the sum is $x_3 = (-4)^2 - 1 - 1 = 14$.\n3. The y-coordinate of the sum is $y_3 = (-4)(1 - 14) - (-1) = 53$.\n\nSo the sum of the point $(1, -1)$ with itself is $(14, 53)$. We can continue to compute sums of these points to find more rational points on the curve. However, finding all rational points on an elliptic curve is a difficult problem in general, and there is no known algorithm to find all of them."
