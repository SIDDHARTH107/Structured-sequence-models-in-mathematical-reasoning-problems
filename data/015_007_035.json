    "message_2": "To find the third term in the sequence {x_n}, we need to calculate x_2 using the recursion relation x_{n+1} = r*x_n*(1-x_n). We are given r = 3.5 and x_0 = 0.5.\n\nFirst, let's find x_1:\nx_1 = r*x_0*(1-x_0)\nx_1 = 3.5*0.5*(1-0.5)\nx_1 = 3.5*0.5*0.5\nx_1 = 0.875\n\nNow, let's find x_2:\nx_2 = r*x_1*(1-x_1)\nx_2 = 3.5*0.875*(1-0.875)\nx_2 = 3.5*0.875*0.125\nx_2 â‰ˆ 0.3828125\n\nSo, the third term in the sequence {x_n} is approximately 0.3828125."
