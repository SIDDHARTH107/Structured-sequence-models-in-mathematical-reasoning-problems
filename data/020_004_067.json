    "message_1": "A company is trying to determine the optimal production quantities for their two products, product A and product B, to maximize their profit. The production of product A costs $3 per unit, while the production of product B costs $4 per unit. They can sell product A for $10 per unit and product B for $15 per unit. The company has a total budget of $2000 for production costs. Formulate a quadratic programming problem to determine the optimal production quantities for product A and product B that will maximize their profit. Solve the problem and find the maximum profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function can be expressed as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nProfit = (10x + 15y) - (3x + 4y)\n\nSimplifying the profit function, we get:\n\nProfit = 7x + 11y\n\nThe constraint for the production budget is:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 2000\n\nSince the production quantities cannot be negative, we also have the following constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we need to maximize the profit function subject to these constraints. This is a linear programming problem, not a quadratic programming problem. We can solve it using the graphical method or the simplex method.\n\nUsing the graphical method, we first plot the constraint:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 2000\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\ny ≤ (2000 - 3x) / 4\n\nPlotting this line and the non-negativity constraints, we find the feasible region. The vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 500), and (666.67, 0). We now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit(0, 0) = 7(0) + 11(0) = 0\n2. Profit(0, 500) = 7(0) + 11(500) = 5500\n3. Profit(666.67, 0) = 7(666.67) + 11(0) = 4666.69\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 500), with a profit of $5500. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 500 units of product B to maximize their profit."
