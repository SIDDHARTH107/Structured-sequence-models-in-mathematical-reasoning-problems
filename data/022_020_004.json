    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using complex analysis techniques, we first need to find the general solution of the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution for the inhomogeneous equation. Finally, we will apply the boundary conditions to find the specific solution.\n\n1. General solution of the homogeneous equation:\n\nThe homogeneous equation is given by:\n\nz''(t) + 2z'(t) + 5z(t) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. We can solve it by assuming a solution of the form z(t) = e^(rt), where r is a constant. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n(r^2 + 2r + 5)e^(rt) = 0\n\nSince e^(rt) is never zero, we can divide both sides by e^(rt) and obtain the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 + 2r + 5 = 0\n\nTo solve for r, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 5. Substituting these values, we get:\n\nr = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(5))) / 2(1)\nr = (-2 ± √(-16)) / 2\nr = -1 ± 2i\n\nSo, the two complex roots are r1 = -1 + 2i and r2 = -1 - 2i. The general solution of the homogeneous equation is given by:\n\nz_h(t) = C1 * e^(-t) * (cos(2t) + i * sin(2t)) + C2 * e^(-t) * (cos(2t) - i * sin(2t))\n\n2. Particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation:\n\nThe inhomogeneous equation is given by:\n\nz''(t) + 2z'(t) + 5z(t) = 14e^(-t)\n\nWe can assume a particular solution of the form z_p(t) = A * e^(-t). Taking the first and second derivatives, we get:\n\nz_p'(t) = -A * e^(-t)\nz_p''(t) = A * e^(-t)\n\nSubstituting these into the inhomogeneous equation, we obtain:\n\nA * e^(-t) - 2A * e^(-t) + 5A * e^(-t) = 14 * e^(-t)\n\nSimplifying and dividing by e^(-t), we get:\n\nA(1 - 2 + 5) = 14\n4A = 14\nA = 7/2\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nz_p(t) = (7/2) * e^(-t)\n\n3. General solution of the inhomogeneous equation:\n\nThe general solution of the inhomogeneous equation is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\nz(t) = z_h(t) + z_p(t)\n\n4. Applying the boundary conditions:\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions to find the specific solution:\n\nz(0) = 0:\n0 = C1 * e^(0) * (1 + 0) + C2 * e^(0) * (1 - 0) + (7/2) * e^(0)\n0 = C1 + C2 + 7/2\nC1 + C2 = -7/2\n\nz(1) = 7:\n7 = C1 * e^(-1) * (cos(2) + i * sin(2)) + C2 * e^(-1) * (cos(2) - i * sin(2)) + (7/2) * e^(-1)\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, C1 and C2. To solve this system, we can rewrite the second equation in terms of real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part:\n7 - (7/2) * e^(-1) = (C1 + C2) * e^(-1) * cos(2)\nImaginary part:\n0 = (C1 - C2) * e^(-1) * sin(2)\n\nSince sin(2) ≠ 0, we can divide the imaginary part by e^(-1) * sin(2) and obtain:\n\n0 = C1 - C2\n\nAdding the equations for C1 + C2 and C1 - C2, we get:\n\n2C1 = -7/2 + 7 * e^(-1) * cos(2)\nC1 = (-7/4) + (7/2) * e^(-1) * cos(2)\n\nSubstituting C1 back into the equation for C1 - C2, we get:\n\nC2 = (-7/4) - (7/2) * e^(-1) * cos(2)\n\n5. Specific solution:\n\nNow we have the specific solution for the boundary value problem:\n\nz(t) = [(-7/4) + (7/2) * e^(-1) * cos(2)] * e^(-t) * (cos(2t) + i * sin(2t)) + [(-7/4) - (7/2) * e^(-1) * cos(2)] * e^(-t) * (cos(2t) - i * sin(2t)) + (7/2) * e^(-t)"
