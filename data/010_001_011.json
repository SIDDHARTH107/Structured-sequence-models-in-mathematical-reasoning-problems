Determine whether the following statements are true or false:\n\n1. {a} is an open set.\n2. {c} is a closed set.\n3. {b,c} is an open set.\n4. X is a closed set.\n\nProvide explanations to justify each answer.",
    "message_2": "1. {a} is an open set.\nTrue. By definition, a set is open if it belongs to the topology τ. Since {a} is an element of τ, it is an open set.\n\n2. {c} is a closed set.\nTrue. A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of {c} in X is {a, b, d}. Since {a} is an open set, we can write {a, b, d} as the union of open sets: {a} ∪ {b, d}. However, {b, d} is not an open set as it is not in τ. But the union of open sets is open, so {a, b, d} is open. Therefore, {c} is a closed set.\n\n3. {b, c} is an open set.\nFalse. A set is open if it belongs to the topology τ. {b, c} is not an element of τ, so it is not an open set.\n\n4. X is a closed set.\nTrue. A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of X in X is the empty set, which is an element of τ. Therefore, the empty set is open, and X is a closed set."
