    "message_1": "A student wants to find the height of a tall building. The student stands at a distance of 25 meters from the base of the building and measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building as 60 degrees. How tall is the building (to the nearest meter), using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the building (25 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = (height of building) / 25\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of tan(60°). Using a calculator or a trigonometry table, we find that:\n\ntan(60°) ≈ 1.732\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\n1.732 = (height of building) / 25\n\nTo solve for the height of the building, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 25:\n\n1.732 * 25 = height of building\n\n43.3 ≈ height of building\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 43 meters."
