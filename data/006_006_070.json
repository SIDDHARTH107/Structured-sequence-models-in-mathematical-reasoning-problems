    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot predict the outcome of a specific game based on past performance, as there are many factors that could influence the result. However, I can provide you with the team's current winning percentage, which might give you an idea of their overall performance so far.\n\nThe team has won 18 out of 25 games, so their winning percentage is:\n\n(18 wins / 25 total games) * 100 = 72%\n\nThis means that, based on their performance so far, they have won 72% of their games. However, this does not guarantee that they will win their next game, as each game is an independent event with its own set of circumstances."
