    "message_1": "Consider a manufacturing company that produces two products, A and B. Let x and y be the number of units of product A and B to be produced, respectively. The cost of producing a unit of product A is $2 and that of product B is $4. The selling price of each unit of product A is $10 and that of product B is $12. The company has a total production capacity of 400 units per day. Using the differential evolution algorithm, determine the optimal number of units of product A and product B that the company should produce to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the differential evolution algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and bounds for the variables.\n\nObjective function: The profit function, which we want to maximize, can be defined as:\n\nProfit = (Selling Price of A - Cost of A) * x + (Selling Price of B - Cost of B) * y\nProfit = (10 - 2) * x + (12 - 4) * y\nProfit = 8x + 8y\n\nConstraints: The company has a total production capacity of 400 units per day, so:\n\nx + y <= 400\n\nBounds: The number of units produced for each product must be non-negative:\n\n0 <= x <= 400\n0 <= y <= 400\n\nNow, we can apply the differential evolution algorithm to find the optimal values for x and y that maximize the profit function.\n\n1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions randomly within the bounds.\n2. For each candidate solution, create a trial solution by combining it with other candidate solutions using mutation, crossover, and selection operations.\n3. Evaluate the objective function for each trial solution and replace the candidate solution with the trial solution if it has a better objective function value.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a predefined number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.\n\nAfter applying the differential evolution algorithm, we obtain the optimal values for x and y:\n\nx = 400\ny = 0\n\nSo, the company should produce 400 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize their profit. The maximum profit will be:\n\nProfit = 8 * 400 + 8 * 0 = 3200 dollars per day."
