    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the Sylow theorems state the following:\n\n1. For any prime p and any positive integer n, if p^n divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^n (called a Sylow p-subgroup).\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted n_p, divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 27 = 3^3. By the first Sylow theorem, G has a subgroup of order 3^3 = 27, which we will call P. Since the order of P is equal to the order of G, P must be equal to G. Thus, G is a 3-group, meaning that the order of every element in G divides 3^3.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, n_3, divides the index [G : P] = 27/27 = 1, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possibility is that n_3 = 1, meaning that there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which we will call H.\n\nSince H is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, it must be normal in G. The order of H is 3, so H is cyclic, generated by an element of order 3. Let K be a subgroup of G such that the order of K is 9. Then, G = HK, and since H is normal in G, we have that G is the internal direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then it has an element of order 27, and we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then it does not have an element of order 27. Since G is a 3-group, the order of every element in G must divide 3^3 = 27. The only possibilities for the orders of elements in G are 1, 3, 9, and 27. We know that G has an element of order 3 (the generator of H), and since G is not cyclic, it cannot have an element of order 27. Thus, the only remaining possibilities for orders of elements in G are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nSince G is not cyclic, K must also be non-cyclic. Therefore, K cannot have an element of order 9. The only possibilities for orders of elements in K are 1 and 3. Thus, K is a group of order 9 with all non-identity elements having order 3. By a well-known theorem, K must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, i.e., K ≅ C_3 × C_3.\n\nIn this case, G ≅ H × K ≅ C_3 × (C_3 × C_3), which is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, as desired.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 27, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
