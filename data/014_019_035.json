    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question: \n\nA transposition cipher used by a spy agency changes the order of blocks of letters in the following way: it takes the first two letters and moves them to the end of the first four letters; then, it takes the next three letters and moves them to the beginning of the next block of four; and so on. For example, the plaintext \"MEET ME AFTER THE TOGA PARTY\" would be encrypted as \"ETEMERETHAGFOAPTYTMEEAPR\". \n\nIf the agency wants to encrypt a message that is exactly 192 letters long using this cipher, how many blocks of letters will be in the ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of blocks in the ciphertext, we need to understand the pattern of the transposition cipher. The first block has 4 letters, and every subsequent block has 4 letters as well. \n\nSince the message is 192 letters long, we can simply divide the total number of letters by the number of letters in each block:\n\n192 letters / 4 letters per block = 48 blocks\n\nSo, there will be 48 blocks of letters in the ciphertext."
