We start with an initial guess of [1; 1; 1] and iterate until the difference between two consecutive guesses is less than or equal to 0.0001.\n\nMatrix A:\n[3 2 1]\n[2 4 2]\n[1 2 3]\n\nInitial guess (x0):\n[1]\n[1]\n[1]\n\nLet's start the iteration process:\n\n1st iteration:\nx1 = A * x0 = [6; 8; 6]\nNormalize x1: x1 = x1 / ||x1|| = [6/10; 8/10; 6/10] = [0.6; 0.8; 0.6]\n\n2nd iteration:\nx2 = A * x1 = [3.6; 6.4; 3.6]\nNormalize x2: x2 = x2 / ||x2|| = [3.6/8; 6.4/8; 3.6/8] = [0.45; 0.8; 0.45]\n\n3rd iteration:\nx3 = A * x2 = [3.3; 6.1; 3.3]\nNormalize x3: x3 = x3 / ||x3|| = [3.3/7.7; 6.1/7.7; 3.3/7.7] ≈ [0.429; 0.792; 0.429]\n\n4th iteration:\nx4 = A * x3 ≈ [3.221; 6.034; 3.221]\nNormalize x4: x4 = x4 / ||x4|| ≈ [3.221/7.476; 6.034/7.476; 3.221/7.476] ≈ [0.431; 0.807; 0.431]\n\nThe difference between x4 and x3 is less than 0.0001, so we can stop the iteration process.\n\nNow, we can find the largest eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\nλ = (x4' * A * x4) / (x4' * x4) ≈ [0.431 0.807 0.431] * A * [0.431; 0.807; 0.431] / [0.431 0.807 0.431] * [0.431; 0.807; 0.431]\n\nλ ≈ 7.999\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue is approximately 8.000, and the corresponding eigenvector is approximately [0.431; 0.807; 0.431]."
