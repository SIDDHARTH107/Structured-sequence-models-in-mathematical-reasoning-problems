    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.2. If an auditor randomly selects 8 companies to audit, what is the probability that at least one of the companies has experienced this type of fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of the companies has experienced this type of fraud, we can use the complementary probability rule. The complementary probability rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nIn this case, the probability of a company not experiencing this type of fraud is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that none of the 8 companies selected have experienced this type of fraud. Since the companies are randomly selected, we can assume that the events are independent. Therefore, we can multiply the probabilities of each company not experiencing fraud:\n\nP(None of the 8 companies experienced fraud) = 0.8^8 = 0.16777216\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(At least one company experienced fraud) = 1 - P(None of the 8 companies experienced fraud) = 1 - 0.16777216 = 0.83222784\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the companies has experienced this type of fraud is approximately 0.8322 or 83.22%."
