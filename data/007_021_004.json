    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an algorithm for finding a non-trivial factor of a composite number. To find the smallest prime factor of 120 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is the number we want to factor (in this case, n = 120).\n\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the function f(x) for both x and y, but apply the function twice for y in each iteration (this is also known as Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm). Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y and the number n (GCD(|x - y|, n)).\n\n4. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is equal to n, the algorithm has failed, and we need to choose a different function or initial values. If the GCD is a factor of n, we have found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's apply Pollard's rho algorithm to find the smallest prime factor of 120:\n\n1. Choose the function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 120.\n\n2. Initialize x = 2 and y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the function and calculate the GCD:\n\n   - First iteration:\n     x = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 120 = 5\n     y = f(f(y)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 120 = 26\n     GCD(|5 - 26|, 120) = GCD(21, 120) = 3\n\nSince we found a non-trivial factor (3) in the first iteration, we can stop here. The smallest prime factor of 120 is 3."
