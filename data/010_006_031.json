    "message_2": "To determine the homotopy group π_1(X, f), we first need to understand the space X and the map f. Since X is the unit circle in the complex plane, it can be parametrized by z = e^(iθ) for θ in [0, 2π). The map f: X -> X is defined by f(z) = z^2, so f(e^(iθ)) = e^(2iθ).\n\nNow, let's consider loops in X based at the point 1. A loop is a continuous map γ: [0, 1] -> X such that γ(0) = γ(1) = 1. Since X is the unit circle, we can write γ(t) = e^(iθ(t)) for some continuous function θ: [0, 1] -> [0, 2π). The condition γ(0) = γ(1) = 1 implies that θ(0) and θ(1) are both integer multiples of 2π.\n\nThe fundamental group π_1(X) is the set of homotopy classes of loops in X based at 1, with the group operation given by concatenation of loops. In this case, π_1(X) is isomorphic to the integers Z, with the isomorphism given by sending a loop γ with winding number n to the integer n. The winding number is the number of times the loop winds around the circle, and it can be computed as n = (θ(1) - θ(0))/(2π).\n\nNow, let's consider the action of f on loops in X. Given a loop γ in X, we can define a new loop f(γ) by f(γ(t)) = γ(t)^2. In terms of the angle function θ(t), this means that f(γ(t)) = e^(2iθ(t)). The winding number of f(γ) is given by (2θ(1) - 2θ(0))/(2π) = 2(θ(1) - θ(0))/(2π) = 2n, where n is the winding number of γ.\n\nThe homotopy group π_1(X, f) is the quotient group of π_1(X) by the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form f(γ) * γ^(-1), where γ is a loop in X. In terms of winding numbers, this means that π_1(X, f) is the quotient group of Z by the subgroup generated by the elements 2n - n = n, for all integers n. This subgroup is just the even integers 2Z, so π_1(X, f) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nIn conclusion, the homotopy group π_1(X, f) is isomorphic to Z/2Z."
