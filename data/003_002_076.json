    "message_1": "A student is standing at the edge of a cliff and looking down at a boat on the sea. The angle of depression to the boat is 35 degrees, and the student is 50 meters above sea level. What is the distance between the student and the boat, rounded to the nearest meter? (Assume a straight line of sight from the student to the boat)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have the angle of depression (35 degrees) and the height of the cliff (50 meters). We can create a right triangle with the height of the cliff as the opposite side, the horizontal distance between the student and the boat as the adjacent side, and the straight line of sight as the hypotenuse.\n\nWe can use the tangent function as follows:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\n\nIn this case, the angle is 35 degrees, and the opposite side is 50 meters. We want to find the adjacent side (the horizontal distance between the student and the boat), which we'll call \"x\".\n\ntan(35) = 50/x\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x and then divide by tan(35):\n\nx = 50/tan(35)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 70.7107 meters\n\nNow, we want to find the distance between the student and the boat, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nhypotenuse² = opposite² + adjacent²\n\nLet's call the hypotenuse \"d\":\n\nd² = 50² + 70.7107²\n\nd² ≈ 2500 + 4999.998\n\nd² ≈ 7499.998\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the distance:\n\nd ≈ √7499.998\n\nd ≈ 86.6025\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the distance between the student and the boat is approximately 87 meters."
