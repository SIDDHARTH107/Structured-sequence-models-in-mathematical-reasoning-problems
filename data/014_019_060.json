    "message_1": "A transposition cipher encrypts the message \"MATHISFUN\" by rearranging the letters. The encrypted message is \"MSHAIFNTU\". If a key is randomly chosen to encrypt messages using transposition cipher, how many different keys are possible?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher rearranges the letters of a message based on a specific key. In this case, the original message \"MATHISFUN\" has 9 letters. To determine the number of different keys possible, we need to find the number of ways to rearrange these 9 letters.\n\nThis is a permutation problem, and the number of permutations can be found using the formula:\n\nn! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1\n\nwhere n is the number of items (in this case, the number of letters in the message).\n\nFor the message \"MATHISFUN\", there are 9 letters, so n = 9. Therefore, the number of different keys possible is:\n\n9! = 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 362,880\n\nSo, there are 362,880 different keys possible for a transposition cipher with a 9-letter message."
