    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) and the equations for the voltage across each component in the circuit. \n\nAt t = 0, the capacitor acts as an open circuit, and the inductor acts as a short circuit. Therefore, the current in the circuit at t = 0 is given by Ohm's law:\n\nI(0) = V/R = 25 V / 10 Ω = 2.5 A\n\nNow, let's find the current as a function of time. We will use the following equations for the voltage across each component:\n\nV_R = I(t) * R\nV_C = Q(t) / C\nV_L = L * dI(t)/dt\n\nApplying KVL, we have:\n\nV_C + V_R + V_L = 0\n\nSubstituting the equations for the voltage across each component, we get:\n\nQ(t) / C + I(t) * R + L * dI(t)/dt = 0\n\nWe know that the current is the derivative of the charge with respect to time:\n\nI(t) = dQ(t)/dt\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndQ(t)/dt * R + Q(t) / C + L * d²Q(t)/dt² = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. To solve it, we assume a solution of the form:\n\nQ(t) = e^(st)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives:\n\ndQ(t)/dt = s * e^(st)\nd²Q(t)/dt² = s² * e^(st)\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the differential equation:\n\ns * e^(st) * R + e^(st) / C + L * s² * e^(st) = 0\n\nDividing by e^(st):\n\ns * R + 1 / C + L * s² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in s. Solving for s:\n\ns² * L + s * R + 1 / C = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-R ± √(R² - 4 * L * (1/C))) / (2 * L)\n\nPlugging in the values of R, L, and C:\n\ns = (-10 ± √(10² - 4 * 2 * (1/100e-6))) / (2 * 2)\n\ns = (-10 ± √(100 - 8e4)) / 4\n\nThe roots are complex:\n\ns1 = -5 + j * ω\ns2 = -5 - j * ω\n\nwhere ω = √(8e4 - 100)\n\nThe general solution for Q(t) is:\n\nQ(t) = A * e^(-5t) * cos(ωt) + B * e^(-5t) * sin(ωt)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we use the initial conditions:\n\nAt t = 0, Q(0) = 25 V * 100e-6 F = 2.5e-3 C\n\n25e-3 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0)\nA = 2.5e-3\n\nAt t = 0, I(0) = 2.5 A\n\n2.5 = -5 * A * sin(0) + ω * B * cos(0)\nB = 2.5 / ω\n\nNow we have the charge as a function of time:\n\nQ(t) = 2.5e-3 * e^(-5t) * cos(ωt) + (2.5 / ω) * e^(-5t) * sin(ωt)\n\nTo find the current as a function of time, we differentiate Q(t) with respect to time:\n\nI(t) = dQ(t)/dt\nI(t) = -5 * 2.5e-3 * e^(-5t) * cos(ωt) - 2.5e-3 * ω * e^(-5t) * sin(ωt) + 2.5 * e^(-5t) * cos(ωt) - 5 * (2.5 / ω) * e^(-5t) * sin(ωt)\n\nThis is the current in the circuit as a function of time."
