    "message_1": "A chemical reaction follows first-order reaction kinetics with a rate constant of 0.05 min^-1. If the initial concentration of the reactant is 0.1 mol/L, what will be its concentration after 30 minutes?",
    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant at any time can be calculated using the integrated rate law:\n\nCt = C0 * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere:\nCt = concentration of the reactant at time t\nC0 = initial concentration of the reactant\nk = rate constant\nt = time\n\nIn this case, we have:\nC0 = 0.1 mol/L\nk = 0.05 min^-1\nt = 30 minutes\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\nCt = 0.1 * e^(-0.05 * 30)\n\nCt = 0.1 * e^(-1.5)\n\nCt ≈ 0.1 * 0.2231\n\nCt ≈ 0.02231 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of the reactant after 30 minutes will be approximately 0.02231 mol/L."
