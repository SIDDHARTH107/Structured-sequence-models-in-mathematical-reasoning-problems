This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A⊕B. This is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA⊕B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSimilarly, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B⊕A.\n\nB⊕A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow we need to find the symmetric difference of (A⊕B) and (B⊕A). Since A⊕B and B⊕A are the same sets, their symmetric difference will be the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\n(A⊕B)⊕(B⊕A) = ∅"
