Policy B has a monthly premium of $125 and covers accidents up to $15,000 in damages. However, the company knows that drivers who choose Policy B are more likely to be risky drivers who are more likely to cause accidents. Specifically, they estimate that the probability of a driver causing an accident is 0.10 if they choose Policy A, and 0.25 if they choose Policy B. Given this information, what is the expected cost per month for the insurance company if they enroll 500 drivers in Policy A and 250 drivers in Policy B? ",
    "message_2": "To find the expected cost per month for the insurance company, we need to calculate the expected cost for each policy and then find the total expected cost for all drivers.\n\nFirst, let's find the expected cost for each policy:\n\nPolicy A:\n- Probability of an accident: 0.10\n- Maximum coverage: $10,000\n- Expected cost per accident: 0.10 * $10,000 = $1,000\n\nPolicy B:\n- Probability of an accident: 0.25\n- Maximum coverage: $15,000\n- Expected cost per accident: 0.25 * $15,000 = $3,750\n\nNow, let's find the total expected cost for all drivers:\n\nPolicy A:\n- Number of drivers: 500\n- Monthly premium: $100\n- Expected cost per driver: $1,000\n- Total expected cost: (500 * $100) + (500 * $1,000) = $50,000 + $500,000 = $550,000\n\nPolicy B:\n- Number of drivers: 250\n- Monthly premium: $125\n- Expected cost per driver: $3,750\n- Total expected cost: (250 * $125) + (250 * $3,750) = $31,250 + $937,500 = $968,750\n\nTotal expected cost for the insurance company:\n- Policy A: $550,000\n- Policy B: $968,750\n- Total: $550,000 + $968,750 = $1,518,750\n\nNow, we need to find the expected cost per month for the insurance company:\n\nExpected cost per month = Total expected cost / Total number of drivers\nExpected cost per month = $1,518,750 / (500 + 250)\nExpected cost per month = $1,518,750 / 750\nExpected cost per month = $2,025\n\nSo, the expected cost per month for the insurance company if they enroll 500 drivers in Policy A and 250 drivers in Policy B is $2,025."
