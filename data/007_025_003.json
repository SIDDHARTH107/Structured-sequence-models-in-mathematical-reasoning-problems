    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve related to Diffie-Hellman key exchange: \n\nAssume the modulo p is 17 and that the primitive root of this modulo is 3. If Alice chooses a secret integer a = 4, and Bob chooses a secret integer b = 3, what is their shared secret key they can use for encryption?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root and a is Alice's secret integer.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret integer.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n\nIf K_A and K_B are equal, then Alice and Bob have the same shared secret key.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. A = 3^4 mod 17 = 81 mod 17 = 13\n2. B = 3^3 mod 17 = 27 mod 17 = 10\n3. K_A = 10^4 mod 17 = 10000 mod 17 = 3\n4. K_B = 13^3 mod 17 = 2197 mod 17 = 3\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal (both are 3), Alice and Bob have the same shared secret key, which is 3."
