    "message_2": "Yes, these two graphs are isomorphic. \n\nAn isomorphism between two graphs is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) function that maps the vertices of one graph to the vertices of the other graph such that the adjacency between the vertices is preserved.\n\nTo show that these two graphs are isomorphic, we can find a bijection between their vertices that preserves adjacency:\n\nLet's map the vertices of Graph 1 to the vertices of Graph 2 as follows:\n\nA -> 1\nB -> 2\nC -> 3\nD -> 4\nE -> 5\n\nNow let's check if the adjacency is preserved:\n\n- AB is an edge in Graph 1, and 12 is an edge in Graph 2.\n- AC is an edge in Graph 1, and 13 is an edge in Graph 2.\n- AD is an edge in Graph 1, and 14 is an edge in Graph 2.\n- BC is an edge in Graph 1, and 23 is an edge in Graph 2.\n- BD is an edge in Graph 1, and 24 is an edge in Graph 2.\n- CD is an edge in Graph 1, and 34 is an edge in Graph 2.\n- DE is an edge in Graph 1, and 45 is an edge in Graph 2.\n\nSince the adjacency is preserved under this mapping, the two graphs are isomorphic."
