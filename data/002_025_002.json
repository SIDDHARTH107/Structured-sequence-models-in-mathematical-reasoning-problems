    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, if the length of each of the congruent sides is 10 cm and the length of the base is 8 cm, what is the length of the altitude drawn to the base?",
    "message_2": "Let's call the isosceles triangle ABC, where A is the vertex between the two congruent sides, and B and C are the endpoints of the base. Let's call the point where the altitude intersects the base D. Since the altitude is drawn to the base, triangle ABD is a right triangle.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude (AD). In right triangle ABD, we have:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n\nWe know that AB = 10 cm (the congruent sides of the isosceles triangle) and BC = 8 cm (the base). Since D is the midpoint of the base, BD = BC/2 = 8/2 = 4 cm.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n10^2 = AD^2 + 4^2\n100 = AD^2 + 16\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\n84 = AD^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nAD = √84\n\nAD ≈ 9.165 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nSo, the length of the altitude drawn to the base is approximately 9.165 cm."
