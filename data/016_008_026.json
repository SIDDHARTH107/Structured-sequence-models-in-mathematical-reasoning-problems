    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1 / r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces in each iteration, and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, N = 4 (since each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments) and r = 1/3 (since each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment).\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(4) / log(3)\n\nHausdorff dimension â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619. This value remains the same for all iterations, including the third iteration."
