The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {3}\n\nSo, A △ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A (A') and B (B') with respect to the universal set U.
