    "message_1": "A drug test is conducted with a new drug that was developed to relieve headaches. Based on previous studies, it is known that 20% of people who use this drug will experience side-effects. A sample of 100 patients is taken, and 25 of them report side-effects after taking the drug. What is the probability that a person who uses this drug will not experience any side-effects? Use Bayesian statistics to answer this question.",
    "message_2": "To use Bayesian statistics, we need to define our prior probabilities, likelihoods, and calculate the posterior probabilities. Let's define the following events:\n\nA: A person experiences side-effects.\nB: A person does not experience side-effects.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the prior probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.20 (20% chance of experiencing side-effects)\nP(B) = 1 - P(A) = 0.80 (80% chance of not experiencing side-effects)\n\nNow, we have the new evidence from the sample of 100 patients, where 25 reported side-effects. We can calculate the likelihoods:\n\nP(Evidence|A) = 25/100 = 0.25 (25% of people with side-effects in the sample)\nP(Evidence|B) = 75/100 = 0.75 (75% of people without side-effects in the sample)\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:\n\nP(A|Evidence) = P(Evidence|A) * P(A) / [P(Evidence|A) * P(A) + P(Evidence|B) * P(B)]\nP(A|Evidence) = (0.25 * 0.20) / [(0.25 * 0.20) + (0.75 * 0.80)]\nP(A|Evidence) = 0.05 / [0.05 + 0.60]\nP(A|Evidence) = 0.05 / 0.65\nP(A|Evidence) ≈ 0.0769\n\nNow, we can find the probability of not experiencing side-effects given the evidence:\n\nP(B|Evidence) = 1 - P(A|Evidence)\nP(B|Evidence) = 1 - 0.0769\nP(B|Evidence) ≈ 0.9231\n\nSo, based on the Bayesian analysis, the probability that a person who uses this drug will not experience any side-effects is approximately 92.31%."
