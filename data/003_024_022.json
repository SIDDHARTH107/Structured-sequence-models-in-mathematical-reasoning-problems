    "message_1": "A canoeist paddles towards a rock island that is 130 meters away from her, with a speed of 3 meters per second. The current in the water flows towards the island at a rate of 1 meter per second. Using trigonometry, find the projection of the velocity vector of the canoeist on the vector of the current.",
    "message_2": "To find the projection of the velocity vector of the canoeist on the vector of the current, we need to find the angle between the two vectors and then use the dot product formula.\n\nLet's denote the velocity vector of the canoeist as V_c and the velocity vector of the current as V_w. The magnitude of V_c is 3 m/s, and the magnitude of V_w is 1 m/s.\n\nWe are given that the canoeist is 130 meters away from the island. Let's assume that the angle between the velocity vector of the canoeist and the velocity vector of the current is θ.\n\nWe can use the dot product formula to find the projection of V_c on V_w:\n\nProjection of V_c on V_w = |V_c| * |V_w| * cos(θ)\n\nHowever, we need to find the angle θ first. Since we don't have enough information to determine the angle directly, we can't solve this problem using trigonometry alone.\n\nIf we had more information about the scenario, such as the angle between the canoeist's path and the direction of the current or the time it takes for the canoeist to reach the island, we could use trigonometry to find the angle and then calculate the projection."
