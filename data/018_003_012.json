    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of elements in the union of sets A and B, we need to consider the case where the maximum number of elements in set B are also in set A. In other words, we need to find the maximum overlap between the two sets.\n\nSince set A has 6 elements and set B has 4 elements, the maximum overlap between the two sets can be 4 elements. This means that all 4 elements of set B are also in set A. In this case, the union of sets A and B will have the same elements as set A, which has 6 elements.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of elements in the resulting set (the union of sets A and B) is 6.\n\nNow, let's prove that this resulting set is a superset of each of the sets A and B.\n\nLet C be the union of sets A and B. By definition, the union of two sets contains all the elements that are in either of the two sets. So, every element in set A is also in set C, and every element in set B is also in set C.\n\nA set X is a superset of another set Y if every element of Y is also an element of X. Since every element in set A is also in set C, set C is a superset of set A. Similarly, since every element in set B is also in set C, set C is a superset of set B.\n\nThus, the resulting set (the union of sets A and B) is a superset of each of the sets A and B."
