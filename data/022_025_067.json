    "message_2": "To solve the given Schrödinger equation, we first note that the equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. We are given that $k = 2i$. Let's rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}y(x) + (2i)^2y(x) = 0$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}y(x) - 4y(x) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can solve this differential equation by assuming a solution of the form $y(x) = e^{rx}$. Plugging this into the equation, we get:\n\n$$r^2e^{rx} - 4e^{rx} = 0$$\n\nDividing both sides by $e^{rx}$, we obtain the characteristic equation:\n\n$$r^2 - 4 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get $r = \\pm 2$. Thus, the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\n$$y(x) = A e^{2x} + B e^{-2x}$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. $y(0) = 0$: \n\n$$0 = A e^{0} + B e^{0} \\Rightarrow A + B = 0 \\Rightarrow B = -A$$\n\n2. $y(\\pi) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = A e^{2\\pi} - A e^{-2\\pi}$$\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we can divide both sides by $A$:\n\n$$0 = e^{2\\pi} - e^{-2\\pi}$$\n\nHowever, this equation has no solution, as the exponential functions are always positive and non-zero. This indicates that there is no non-trivial solution to the given Schrödinger equation with the specified boundary conditions."
