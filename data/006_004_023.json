    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a 3 on the first roll and then rolling a 2 on the second roll, we can multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\nThe probability of rolling a 3 on the first roll is 1/6, since there is one 3 and six possible outcomes on a fair six-sided die.\n\nThe probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is also 1/6, for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36."
