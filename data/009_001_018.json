    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the constant of integration. The differential equation is:\n\ndy/dt = 0.5y - 5\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is given by:\n\nIF = e^(∫P(t) dt) = e^(∫0.5 dt) = e^(0.5t)\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(0.5t) dy/dt + 0.5e^(0.5t)y = 5e^(0.5t)\n\nThe left side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of y(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt (y(t)e^(0.5t)) = 5e^(0.5t)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(d/dt (y(t)e^(0.5t))) dt = ∫(5e^(0.5t)) dt\n\ny(t)e^(0.5t) = 10e^(0.5t) + C\n\nNow, we solve for y(t):\n\ny(t) = 10e^(-0.5t) + Ce^(-0.5t)\n\nWe are given the initial condition that y(0) = 15 (since the population is in thousands). We can use this to find the constant C:\n\n15 = 10e^(0) + Ce^(0)\n15 = 10 + C\nC = 5\n\nSo the equation for the fish population is:\n\ny(t) = 10e^(-0.5t) + 5e^(-0.5t)\n\nNow, we can find the fish population after 10 years by plugging in t = 10:\n\ny(10) = 10e^(-0.5*10) + 5e^(-0.5*10)\ny(10) = 10e^(-5) + 5e^(-5)\ny(10) = 15e^(-5)\n\nNow, we can find the numerical value:\n\ny(10) ≈ 15 * 0.00674\ny(10) ≈ 0.1011 (in thousands)\n\nSo, the fish population after 10 years will be approximately 101.1 fish."
