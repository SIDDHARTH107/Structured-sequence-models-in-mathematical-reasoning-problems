The cost of producing 'x' number of units of the product can be given as: \n\nC(x) = 1000 + 4x + 0.002x^2 \n\nIf the product can be sold for $10 per unit, find the number of units the factory should produce in a day to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the revenue function, R(x), and then subtract the cost function, C(x), to get the profit function, P(x). \n\nThe revenue function is given by the price per unit multiplied by the number of units produced and sold, which is:\n\nR(x) = 10x\n\nNow, let's find the profit function, P(x):\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x)\nP(x) = 10x - (1000 + 4x + 0.002x^2)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nP(x) = 6x - 1000 - 0.002x^2\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the derivative of P(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = d/dx (6x - 1000 - 0.002x^2)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nP'(x) = 6 - 0.004x\n\nNow, set P'(x) equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 6 - 0.004x\n0.004x = 6\nx = 6 / 0.004\nx = 1500\n\nHowever, the factory can only produce a maximum of 1200 units per day. Therefore, the factory should produce 1200 units per day to maximize the profit, as producing 1500 units is not possible."
