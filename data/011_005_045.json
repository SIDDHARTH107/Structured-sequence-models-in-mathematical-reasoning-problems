    "message_2": "Let's first calculate the total number of ways to choose a team of 6 players from a group of 12 players without any restrictions. This can be done using combinations, which is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players, r is the number of players to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose a team of 6 players from a group of 12 players is:\n\nC(12, 6) = 12! / (6!(12-6)!) = 12! / (6!6!) = 924\n\nNow, let's consider the restriction that the two players who refuse to be on the same team. There are two cases:\n\n1. Both players are not on the team: In this case, we are choosing a team of 6 players from a group of 10 players (excluding the two players who refuse to be on the same team). The number of ways to do this is:\n\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6!(10-6)!) = 10! / (6!4!) = 210\n\n2. One of the two players is on the team: In this case, we are choosing a team of 5 players from a group of 10 players (excluding the two players who refuse to be on the same team) and then adding one of the two players. The number of ways to do this is:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 10! / (5!5!) = 252\n\nSince there are 2 players who can be added to the team, the total number of ways for this case is 2 * 252 = 504.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of teams that can be created with the restriction by adding the number of ways for both cases:\n\nTotal teams with restriction = 210 + 504 = 714\n\nSo, the student can create 714 different teams with the given restriction."
