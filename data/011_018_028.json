    "message_1": "In a block design, there are 10 blocks each containing exactly 4 points, and every pair of points is contained in exactly one of the blocks. How many points are there in total?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the total number of points as n. Since each block contains 4 points, there are C(4, 2) = 6 pairs of points in each block. Since there are 10 blocks, there are a total of 10 * 6 = 60 pairs of points.\n\nNow, we know that every pair of points is contained in exactly one of the blocks. So, there are C(n, 2) = 60 pairs of points in total, where C(n, 2) represents the number of combinations of n points taken 2 at a time.\n\nC(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n-2)!) = 60\nn! / (2!(n-2)!) = 60\nn! / (2 * (n-2)!) = 60\n\nWe can now solve for n:\n\nn(n-1) / 2 = 60\nn(n-1) = 120\nn^2 - n - 120 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nn = (-(-1) ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-120))) / (2(1))\nn = (1 ± √481) / 2\n\nSince n must be a positive integer, we can discard the negative square root:\n\nn = (1 + √481) / 2 ≈ 15.87\n\nSince n must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nn = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 points in total."
