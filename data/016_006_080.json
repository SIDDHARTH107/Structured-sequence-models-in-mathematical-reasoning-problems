    "message_2": "To find the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern, we need to analyze the transformation matrix. The transformation matrix is given by:\n\n```\n[0.85  0.04]\n[0.04  0.85]\n```\n\nThe scaling factor can be found by calculating the eigenvalues of the transformation matrix. The eigenvalues represent the scaling factor of the transformation in different directions.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by:\n\n`det(A - λI) = 0`\n\nwhere A is the transformation matrix, λ is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix.\n\nFor the given transformation matrix, the characteristic equation is:\n\n`det([0.85 - λ, 0.04; 0.04, 0.85 - λ]) = (0.85 - λ)^2 - (0.04 * 0.04) = 0`\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n`λ^2 - 1.7λ + 0.7225 = 0`\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for λ using the quadratic formula:\n\n`λ = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`\n\nwhere a = 1, b = -1.7, and c = 0.7225.\n\n`λ = (1.7 ± sqrt((-1.7)^2 - 4 * 1 * 0.7225)) / 2`\n\n`λ = (1.7 ± sqrt(2.89 - 2.89)) / 2`\n\n`λ = (1.7 ± 0) / 2`\n\n`λ = 1.7 / 2`\n\n`λ = 0.85`\n\nSince there is only one eigenvalue (0.85), the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern for the given transformation matrix is 0.85."
