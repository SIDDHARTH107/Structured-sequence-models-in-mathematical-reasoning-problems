    "message_2": "This differential equation is known as the Legendre differential equation. To find the values of $\\lambda$ for which the solutions are entire functions, we can use the Frobenius method. \n\nLet $y(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$ be the power series solution of the differential equation. Then, the first and second derivatives are given by:\n\n$y'(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n z^{n-1}$\n\n$y''(z) = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n z^{n-2}$\n\nSubstituting these into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$(1-z^2) \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n z^{n-2} + 2z \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n z^{n-1} - \\lambda \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n = 0$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the terms and combine the series:\n\n$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n z^{n-2} - \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n z^n + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2n a_n z^n - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda a_n z^n = 0$\n\nFor this equation to hold for all $z$, the coefficients of each power of $z$ must be equal to zero. Therefore, we have the following recurrence relation:\n\n$n(n-1)a_n - (n-2)(n-3)a_{n-2} + 2(n-1)a_{n-1} - \\lambda a_n = 0$\n\nRearranging for $a_n$, we get:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{(n-2)(n-3)a_{n-2} - 2(n-1)a_{n-1}}{n(n-1) - \\lambda}$\n\nFor the solution to be entire, the series must converge for all $z$. This will happen if the coefficients $a_n$ do not grow too fast as $n$ increases. In particular, we want to find values of $\\lambda$ such that the ratio $|a_n/a_{n-1}|$ is bounded as $n$ goes to infinity.\n\nFrom the recurrence relation, we have:\n\n$\\frac{|a_n|}{|a_{n-1}|} = \\frac{|(n-2)(n-3)a_{n-2} - 2(n-1)a_{n-1}|}{|(n(n-1) - \\lambda)a_{n-1}|} \\leq \\frac{(n-2)(n-3)|a_{n-2}| + 2(n-1)|a_{n-1}|}{|(n(n-1) - \\lambda)a_{n-1}|}$\n\nAs $n$ goes to infinity, the ratio converges if and only if the numerator grows slower than the denominator. This happens when $\\lambda = n(n-1)$ for some non-negative integer $n$. In this case, the ratio converges to a constant, and the series converges for all $z$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $\\lambda$ for which the solutions of the differential equation are entire functions are given by $\\lambda = n(n-1)$ for non-negative integers $n$."
