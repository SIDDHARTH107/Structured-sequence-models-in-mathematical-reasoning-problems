    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 2x^3 - 4x + 1 between x = 0 and x = 3, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of the function is:\n\n∫(2x^3 - 4x + 1) dx\n\nTo integrate, we'll use the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1):\n\n∫(2x^3) dx - ∫(4x) dx + ∫(1) dx\n\n= (2x^4)/4 - (4x^2)/2 + x + C\n\n= (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + x + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the given limits, x = 0 and x = 3:\n\n[(1/2)(3^4) - 2(3^2) + 3] - [(1/2)(0^4) - 2(0^2) + 0]\n\n= [(1/2)(81) - 2(9) + 3] - [0]\n\n= [40.5 - 18 + 3]\n\n= 25.5\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 2x^3 - 4x + 1 between x = 0 and x = 3 is 25.5 square units."
