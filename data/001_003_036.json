    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same:\n\n1) Multiply the first equation by 2:\n   6x + 8y = 20\n\n2) Multiply the second equation by 4:\n   28x - 8y = 88\n\nNow, we will add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(6x + 8y) + (28x - 8y) = 20 + 88\n6x + 28x = 108\n34x = 108\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\nx = 108 / 34\nx = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we will substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. We will use the first equation:\n\n3x + 4y = 10\n3(3) + 4y = 10\n9 + 4y = 10\n\nNow, we will solve for y:\n4y = 10 - 9\n4y = 1\ny = 1 / 4\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 3 and y = 1/4."
