After conducting a frequency analysis, you find that the letter \"E\" appears most frequently, followed by the letters \"A\" and \"T\" respectively. Your analysis indicates that \"E\" appears at a frequency of 20%, \"A\" appears at 15%, and \"T\" appears at 10%. \n\nGiven this information, what is the probability that the next letter in the message is an \"E\"?",
