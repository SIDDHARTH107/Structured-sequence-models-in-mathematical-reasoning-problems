    "message_2": "To prove this using inductive logic, we will use the principle of mathematical induction. The sum of the first n counting numbers can be represented by the formula:\n\nS(n) = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\nWe will prove this formula is correct for n = 1 (base case) and then show that if it is true for n = k, it is also true for n = k + 1 (inductive step).\n\nBase case (n = 1):\nS(1) = 1 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 1 * 2 / 2 = 1\n\nSince the sum of the first counting number is indeed 1, the base case is true.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume the formula is true for n = k, i.e., S(k) = k * (k + 1) / 2. We need to show that the formula is also true for n = k + 1.\n\nS(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1)\n\nSubstitute the formula for S(k):\nS(k + 1) = k * (k + 1) / 2 + (k + 1)\n\nFactor out (k + 1):\nS(k + 1) = (k + 1) * (k / 2 + 1)\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\nS(k + 1) = (k + 1) * ((k + 2) / 2)\n\nThis is the same as the formula for S(n) with n = k + 1:\nS(k + 1) = (k + 1) * ((k + 1) + 1) / 2\n\nThus, the formula holds for n = k + 1 if it holds for n = k.\n\nNow, we can use the formula to calculate the sum of the first 100 counting numbers:\n\nS(100) = 100 * (100 + 1) / 2 = 100 * 101 / 2 = 5050\n\nSo, the sum of the first 100 counting numbers is indeed 5,050, and the computer program's calculation is correct."
