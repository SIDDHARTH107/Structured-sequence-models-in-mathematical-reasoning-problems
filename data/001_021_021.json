    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 + 3x^2 - 16x + 12 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial or use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or synthetic division. In this case, let's try factoring.\n\nFirst, we can look for a common factor among all the terms. There is no common factor, so we can try factoring by grouping.\n\nx^3 + 3x^2 - 16x + 12 = 0\n\nGroup the terms:\n\n(x^3 + 3x^2) + (-16x + 12) = 0\n\nFactor out the common factors in each group:\n\nx^2(x + 3) - 4(4x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we see that there is no common factor between the two groups, and the polynomial does not factor easily. Therefore, we will use the Rational Root Theorem to find the possible rational roots of the polynomial.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (12) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (1).\n\nFactors of 12: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12\n\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are the factors of 12.\n\nNow, we can test these possible rational roots using synthetic division or direct substitution. After testing, we find that x = 2 is a root:\n\n(2)^3 + 3(2)^2 - 16(2) + 12 = 8 + 12 - 32 + 12 = 0\n\nNow that we have found a root, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\nx^3 + 3x^2 - 16x + 12 = (x - 2)(x^2 + 5x - 6)\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic:\n\nx^2 + 5x - 6 = (x - 1)(x + 6)\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as:\n\nx^3 + 3x^2 - 16x + 12 = (x - 2)(x - 1)(x + 6)\n\nThe solutions to the equation x^3 + 3x^2 - 16x + 12 = 0 are:\n\nx = 2, x = 1, and x = -6."
