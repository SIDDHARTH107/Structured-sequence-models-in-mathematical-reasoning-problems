    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of trials (coin flips), which is 100\n- k is the number of successful trials (number of heads), which is 50\n- p is the probability of success (probability of getting a head), which is 0.5 (since there are 2 sides of a coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (probability of getting a tail), which is also 0.5\n- ! denotes the factorial function\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(50) = (100! / (50! * 50!)) * (0.5^50) * (0.5^50)\n\nCalculating the factorials and simplifying the expression, we get:\n\nP(50) â‰ˆ 0.0795892\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 coin flips is approximately 7.96%."
