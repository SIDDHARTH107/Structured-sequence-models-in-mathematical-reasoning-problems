    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm and the lengths of its parallel sides are 8 cm and 12 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (sum of parallel sides) × height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 8 cm and 12 cm, and the height is 10 cm. So, the area of the trapezoid is:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (8 + 12) × 10\nArea = (1/2) × 20 × 10\nArea = 10 × 10\nArea = 100 square centimeters"
