Similarly, for B x A, we take each element of set B and pair it with each element of set A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two Cartesian products:\n\nA x B ≠ B x A\n\n{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} ≠ {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements of A x B and B x A are not the same, hence proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
