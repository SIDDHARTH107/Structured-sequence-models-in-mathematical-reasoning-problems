    "message_1": "Suppose you are playing a game where you have a 1 in 10 chance of winning a prize. If you play this game 20 times, what is the probability that you will win at least 2 prizes?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning at least 2 prizes in 20 attempts, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of winning 0 or 1 prize.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of winning 0 prizes and the probability of winning 1 prize:\n\n1. Probability of winning 0 prizes:\nThe probability of not winning a prize in a single attempt is 1 - 1/10 = 9/10. Since the attempts are independent, the probability of not winning any prize in 20 attempts is (9/10)^20.\n\n2. Probability of winning 1 prize:\nThere are 20 different attempts in which you can win a single prize. The probability of winning a prize in a single attempt is 1/10, and the probability of not winning a prize in the other 19 attempts is (9/10)^19. So, the probability of winning exactly 1 prize in 20 attempts is 20 * (1/10) * (9/10)^19.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 2 prizes) = 1 - P(0 prizes) - P(1 prize)\nP(at least 2 prizes) = 1 - (9/10)^20 - [20 * (1/10) * (9/10)^19]\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nP(at least 2 prizes) ≈ 1 - 0.3585 - 0.3774\nP(at least 2 prizes) ≈ 0.2641\n\nSo, the probability of winning at least 2 prizes in 20 attempts is approximately 26.41%."
