    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven a radius (r) of 5 centimeters, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)³\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (125 cm³)\nV = 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 125 cm³\nV ≈ 523.598 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 centimeters is approximately 523.598 cubic centimeters."
