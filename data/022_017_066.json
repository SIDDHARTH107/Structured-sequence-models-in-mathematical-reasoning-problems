    "message_2": "To solve the complex differential equation, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$y(x) = e^{rx}$$\n\nwhere $r$ is a complex constant. Taking the first and second derivatives, we get:\n\n$$y'(x) = re^{rx}$$\n$$y''(x) = r^2e^{rx}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the given differential equation:\n\n$$r^2e^{rx} + 4e^{rx} = 0$$\n\nWe can factor out $e^{rx}$, which is nonzero for all $x$:\n\n$$(r^2 + 4) e^{rx} = 0$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$r^2 + 4 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n\n$$r = \\pm 2i$$\n\nNow, we have two linearly independent solutions:\n\n$$y_1(x) = e^{2ix}$$\n$$y_2(x) = e^{-2ix}$$\n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of these two solutions:\n\n$$y(x) = c_1 e^{2ix} + c_2 e^{-2ix}$$\n\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are complex constants. To find these constants, we use the initial conditions. First, we have $y(0) = 1$:\n\n$$1 = c_1 e^{0} + c_2 e^{0}$$\n$$1 = c_1 + c_2$$\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the general solution:\n\n$$y'(x) = 2ic_1 e^{2ix} - 2ic_2 e^{-2ix}$$\n\nUsing the initial condition $y'(0) = 2i$, we get:\n\n$$2i = 2ic_1 e^{0} - 2ic_2 e^{0}$$\n$$2i = 2ic_1 - 2ic_2$$\n\nDividing by $2i$, we have:\n\n$$1 = c_1 - c_2$$\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\n$$c_1 + c_2 = 1$$\n$$c_1 - c_2 = 1$$\n\nSolving this system, we find:\n\n$$c_1 = 1$$\n$$c_2 = 0$$\n\nThus, the solution to the complex differential equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\n$$y(x) = e^{2ix}$$"
