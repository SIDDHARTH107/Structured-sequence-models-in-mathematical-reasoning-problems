    "message_1": "A factory produces two products: chairs and tables. The selling price for chairs is $120 each and for tables is $150 each. The factory has 120 hours of carpentry available, 90 hours of finishing available and 110 hours of assembly available per week. It takes 3 hours to make a chair, 2 hours to finish it, and 2 hours to assemble it. It takes 4 hours to make a table, 3 hours to finish it, and 4 hours to assemble it. How many chairs and tables should the factory produce per week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced per week.\n\nThe constraints for the available hours are as follows:\n\nCarpentry: 3x + 4y ≤ 120\nFinishing: 2x + 3y ≤ 90\nAssembly: 2x + 4y ≤ 110\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 120x + 150y\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we will find the feasible region determined by the constraints and then evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we will graph the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 4y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (120 - 3x) / 4\n\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 90\ny ≤ (90 - 2x) / 3\n\n3. 2x + 4y ≤ 110\ny ≤ (110 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0,0), (0,27.5), (20,22.5), (30,10), and (40,0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit(0,0) = 120(0) + 150(0) = $0\n2. Profit(0,27.5) = 120(0) + 150(27.5) = $4,125\n3. Profit(20,22.5) = 120(20) + 150(22.5) = $5,850\n4. Profit(30,10) = 120(30) + 150(10) = $4,800\n5. Profit(40,0) = 120(40) + 150(0) = $4,800\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the factory produces 20 chairs and 22.5 tables per week. However, since it's not possible to produce half a table, the factory should produce either 22 or 23 tables. We will compare the profits for these two options:\n\n1. Profit(20,22) = 120(20) + 150(22) = $5,740\n2. Profit(20,23) = 120(20) + 150(23) = $5,890\n\nThe factory should produce 20 chairs and 23 tables per week to maximize their profit, which will be $5,890."
