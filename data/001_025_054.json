    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 5z + 6 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-5 ± √(5^2 - 4 * 1 * 6)) / 2 * 1\nz = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2\nz = (-5 ± √1) / 2\n\nNow we can find the two possible values for z:\n\nz = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2\nz = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation z^2 + 5z + 6 = 0 are z = -2 and z = -3."
