Suppose that the number of index-2 critical points is equal to the number of all other critical points combined. What is the total number of critical points in this Morse-Smale complex?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of index-0 critical points as a, the number of index-1 critical points as b, and the number of index-2 critical points as c. We are given that a = 6, b = 4, and c = a + b.\n\nNow we can use the given information to find the total number of critical points in the Morse-Smale complex.\n\nc = a + b\nc = 6 + 4\nc = 10\n\nSo there are 10 index-2 critical points. To find the total number of critical points, we add the number of critical points of each index:\n\nTotal critical points = a + b + c\nTotal critical points = 6 + 4 + 10\nTotal critical points = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 20 critical points in this Morse-Smale complex."
