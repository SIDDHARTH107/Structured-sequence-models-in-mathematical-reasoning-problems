    "message_1": "Suppose that there are three bidders participating in a sealed-bid auction for a rare antique vase. The bidders' values for the vase are $200, $300, and $400, respectively. Each bidder's cost to participate in the auction is $10. Assume that the highest bidder wins and pays the amount of their bid. What is the optimal bid for each bidder?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid auction, the optimal bid for each bidder is to bid slightly below their true value for the item to maximize their profit. This is because they want to win the auction without overpaying for the item. However, they also need to consider the cost of participating in the auction.\n\nLet's denote the bidders as A, B, and C, with values of $200, $300, and $400, respectively.\n\nBidder A's optimal bid should be slightly below $200, as they cannot outbid B or C without overpaying for the vase. A reasonable bid for A could be $190, taking into account the $10 participation cost.\n\nBidder B knows that A's maximum value is $200, so they should bid slightly above that to ensure they outbid A but not overpay for the vase. A reasonable bid for B could be $210, taking into account the $10 participation cost.\n\nBidder C knows that B's maximum value is $300, so they should bid slightly above that to ensure they outbid B but not overpay for the vase. A reasonable bid for C could be $310, taking into account the $10 participation cost.\n\nIn summary, the optimal bids for the bidders are:\n- Bidder A: $190\n- Bidder B: $210\n- Bidder C: $310"
