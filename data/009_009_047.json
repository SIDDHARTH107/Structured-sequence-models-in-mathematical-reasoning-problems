    "message_2": "To find the energy levels and wave functions of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\nΨ''(x) + (2m/h^2)(E - V(x))Ψ(x) = 0\n\nFor an infinite potential well of width L = 1 nm, the potential energy V(x) is given by:\n\nV(x) = 0, for 0 < x < L\nV(x) = ∞, for x ≤ 0 or x ≥ L\n\nSince the potential energy is infinite outside the well, the wave function Ψ(x) must be zero in those regions. Inside the well, V(x) = 0, so the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\nΨ''(x) + (2mE/h^2)Ψ(x) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution is:\n\nΨ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere k = sqrt(2mE/h^2), A and B are constants, and h is the reduced Planck's constant (h ≈ 6.626 x 10^(-34) Js).\n\nTo find the energy levels, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\nΨ(0) = 0 and Ψ(L) = 0\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, Ψ(0) = 0, we get:\n\n0 = A sin(0) + B cos(0) => B = 0\n\nSo, the wave function simplifies to:\n\nΨ(x) = A sin(kx)\n\nApplying the second boundary condition, Ψ(L) = 0, we get:\n\n0 = A sin(kL)\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivial), we must have:\n\nsin(kL) = 0 => kL = nπ, where n is an integer.\n\nThe energy levels can now be found using the relation:\n\nE_n = (h^2 * k^2) / (2m)\n\nSubstituting kL = nπ, we get:\n\nE_n = (h^2 * (nπ/L)^2) / (2m)\n\nFor the first three energy levels (n = 1, 2, 3), we have:\n\nE_1 = (h^2 * π^2) / (2mL^2)\nE_2 = (h^2 * 4π^2) / (2mL^2)\nE_3 = (h^2 * 9π^2) / (2mL^2)\n\nTo find the numerical values, we need to know the mass of the particle. Assuming the particle is an electron, its mass is m ≈ 9.109 x 10^(-31) kg. Using L = 1 nm and h ≈ 6.626 x 10^(-34) Js, we can calculate the energy levels in Joules and then convert them to electron volts (1 eV = 1.602 x 10^(-19) J):\n\nE_1 ≈ 37.69 x 10^(-20) J ≈ 0.235 eV\nE_2 ≈ 150.76 x 10^(-20) J ≈ 0.941 eV\nE_3 ≈ 339.21 x 10^(-20) J ≈ 2.118 eV\n\nFinally, the corresponding wave functions are:\n\nΨ_1(x) = A_1 sin(πx/L)\nΨ_2(x) = A_2 sin(2πx/L)\nΨ_3(x) = A_3 sin(3πx/L)\n\nTo determine the constants A_1, A_2, and A_3, we need to normalize the wave functions by ensuring that the integral of |Ψ_n(x)|^2 over the well is equal to 1:\n\n∫[0, L] |Ψ_n(x)|^2 dx = 1\n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3, this gives:\n\nA_1 = sqrt(2/L) ≈ sqrt(2) nm^(-1/2)\nA_2 = sqrt(2/L) ≈ sqrt(2) nm^(-1/2)\nA_3 = sqrt(2/L) ≈ sqrt(2) nm^(-1/2)\n\nSo, the first three normalized wave functions are:\n\nΨ_1(x) = sqrt(2) sin(πx)\nΨ_2(x) = sqrt(2) sin(2πx)\nΨ_3(x) = sqrt(2) sin(3πx)\n\nwhere x is in nanometers."
