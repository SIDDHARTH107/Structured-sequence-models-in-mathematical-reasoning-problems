    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard with a length of 20 cm and width of 15 cm has two identical squares cut out of each corner. The remaining sides are folded up to form a box with no lid. What is the maximum volume of the box that can be made? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the identical squares cut out of each corner. After cutting the squares and folding the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 20 - 2x\nWidth: 15 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume of the box, V, can be expressed as the product of its length, width, and height:\n\nV(x) = (20 - 2x)(15 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the volume function by taking its first derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (20 - 2x)(15 - 2x)(-2) + (20 - 2x)(x) + (15 - 2x)(x)\n\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n\nV'(x) = -4x^3 + 70x^2 - 600x\n\nTo find the critical points, we set V'(x) = 0:\n\n0 = -4x^3 + 70x^2 - 600x\n\nWe can factor out a -2x:\n\n0 = 2x(2x^2 - 35x + 300)\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the quadratic part:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (35 ± √(35^2 - 4(2)(300))) / (2(2))\n\nx ≈ 5.54, 10.46\n\nSince the width of the cardboard is 15 cm, we cannot cut out squares with a side length of 10.46 cm. Therefore, the maximum volume is achieved when x ≈ 5.54 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the box:\n\nLength: 20 - 2(5.54) ≈ 8.92 cm\nWidth: 15 - 2(5.54) ≈ 3.92 cm\nHeight: 5.54 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum volume:\n\nV_max ≈ 8.92 * 3.92 * 5.54 ≈ 193.97 cm^3\n\nThe maximum volume of the box that can be made is approximately 193.97 cm^3, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
