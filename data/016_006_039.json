    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) with four affine transformations. The scaling factors for each transformation are as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1: Scaling factor = 0.01\n2. Transformation 2: Scaling factor = 0.85\n3. Transformation 3: Scaling factor = 0.2\n4. Transformation 4: Scaling factor = 0.15\n\nAfter the first iteration, the scaling factor depends on which transformation is applied. The probability of each transformation being applied is:\n\n1. Transformation 1: 1%\n2. Transformation 2: 85%\n3. Transformation 3: 7%\n4. Transformation 4: 7%\n\nSo, after the first iteration, the scaling factor will be one of the four values mentioned above, depending on the transformation applied."
