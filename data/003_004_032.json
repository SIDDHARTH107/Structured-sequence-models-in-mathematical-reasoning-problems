    "message_2": "To find all solutions to the equation 2cos(x) - sqrt(3) = 0 in the interval [0, 2pi], we first isolate cos(x):\n\n2cos(x) = sqrt(3)\ncos(x) = sqrt(3)/2\n\nNow, we need to find all angles x in the interval [0, 2pi] for which the cosine is equal to sqrt(3)/2. Recall that cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants. \n\nIn the first quadrant, the reference angle for which cos(x) = sqrt(3)/2 is pi/6. So, one solution is:\n\nx = pi/6\n\nIn the fourth quadrant, the reference angle is also pi/6. To find the angle in the fourth quadrant, we subtract the reference angle from 2pi:\n\nx = 2pi - pi/6\nx = (12pi - pi)/6\nx = 11pi/6\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation 2cos(x) - sqrt(3) = 0 in the interval [0, 2pi] are:\n\nx = pi/6 and x = 11pi/6"
