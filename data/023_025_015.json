    "message_2": "To find the spatial frequency component corresponding to the highest amplitude in the Fourier transform of f(x) = 4x - x^2, we first need to compute the Fourier transform of f(x).\n\nThe Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the entire real line, and k is the spatial frequency.\n\nFor f(x) = 4x - x^2, we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[(4x - x^2) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nTo compute this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let's first compute the integral for the two terms separately:\n\n1) For the term 4x:\n\nLet u = 4x, so du = 4 dx\nLet dv = e^(-2πikx) dx, so v = (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[4x * e^(-2πikx)] dx = uv - ∫[v * du]\n= (-4x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - ∫[(-4/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n= (-4x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) + (4/(2πik)) * (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)\n= (-4x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - (4/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx)\n\n2) For the term -x^2:\n\nLet u = -x^2, so du = -2x dx\nLet dv = e^(-2πikx) dx, so v = (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[-x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx = uv - ∫[v * du]\n= (x^2/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) + ∫[(-2x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nNow, we can use the result from the first term:\n\n= (x^2/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - (x/(πik)) * ((-4x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - (4/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx))\n= (x^2/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) + (4x^2/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx) - (4x/(4π^2k^3)) * e^(-2πikx)\n\nNow, combining the results for both terms:\n\nF(k) = (-4x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - (4/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx) + (x^2/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) + (4x^2/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx) - (4x/(4π^2k^3)) * e^(-2πikx)\n\nTo find the spatial frequency component corresponding to the highest amplitude, we need to find the maximum of |F(k)|. To do this, we can compute the derivative of |F(k)| with respect to k and set it to zero, then solve for k. However, this is a complex and difficult task due to the nature of the function.\n\nAlternatively, we can use numerical methods or software tools to find the maximum of |F(k)|, which will give us the spatial frequency component corresponding to the highest amplitude in the Fourier transform of f(x)."
