What is the equation that describes the rope's motion over time using Fourier analysis, and what is the frequency of the second harmonic in the resulting waveform?",
    "message_2": "To describe the motion of the rope over time using Fourier analysis, we need to find the equation of the rope's displacement as a function of time and position along the rope. The rope's motion can be modeled as a vibrating string, which is governed by the wave equation:\n\n∂²y(x,t) / ∂t² = c² ∂²y(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere y(x,t) is the displacement of the rope at position x and time t, and c is the wave speed along the rope.\n\nThe boundary conditions for this problem are:\n1. y(0,t) = 0 (fixed end)\n2. y(10,t) = 0 (weight attached)\n3. y(x,0) = f(x) (initial displacement)\n4. ∂y(x,0) / ∂t = 0 (initially at rest)\n\nThe initial displacement f(x) is given as 1 meter, and we can assume it's a sine function:\n\nf(x) = sin(πx/10)\n\nNow, we can use Fourier analysis to find the solution to the wave equation. The general solution for a vibrating string is:\n\ny(x,t) = Σ [A_n * sin(nπx/L) * cos(nπct/L) + B_n * sin(nπx/L) * sin(nπct/L)]\n\nSince the rope is initially at rest, all B_n coefficients are zero. To find the A_n coefficients, we use the initial displacement function:\n\nA_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nFor our problem, L = 10 meters, and f(x) = sin(πx/10). The only nonzero coefficient is A_1, which can be found by integrating:\n\nA_1 = (2/10) * ∫[sin(πx/10) * sin(πx/10) dx] from 0 to 10\n\nA_1 = 1\n\nSo, the equation that describes the rope's motion over time is:\n\ny(x,t) = sin(πx/10) * cos(πct/10)\n\nNow, we need to find the frequency of the second harmonic. The frequency of the nth harmonic is given by:\n\nf_n = (n * c) / (2 * L)\n\nTo find the frequency of the second harmonic (n = 2), we need to know the wave speed c. The wave speed depends on the rope's tension (T) and linear mass density (μ):\n\nc = sqrt(T/μ)\n\nWithout information about the rope's tension and linear mass density, we cannot determine the exact frequency of the second harmonic. However, the general formula for the second harmonic frequency is:\n\nf_2 = (2 * c) / (2 * 10) = c / 10"
