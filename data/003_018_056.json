    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = cos(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if y = f(g(x)), then the derivative dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nIn this case, our function y = cos(2x) can be written as y = f(g(x)), where f(u) = cos(u) and g(x) = 2x.\n\nFirst, we'll find the derivatives of f(u) and g(x) with respect to their respective variables:\n\nf'(u) = -sin(u)\ng'(x) = 2\n\nNow, we'll apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\ndy/dx = -sin(2x) * 2\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx = -sin(2 * π/4) * 2\ndy/dx = -sin(π/2) * 2\ndy/dx = -1 * 2\ndy/dx = -2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = cos(2x) at x = π/4 is -2."
