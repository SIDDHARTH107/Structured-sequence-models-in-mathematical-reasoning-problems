    "message_1": "A lumber company has 1000 board feet of maple lumber and 800 board feet of cherry lumber. They want to produce two products: chairs and tables. To make each chair, 30 board feet of maple lumber and 20 board feet of cherry lumber are required. To make each table, 50 board feet of maple lumber and 40 board feet of cherry lumber are required. The company has a market for at most 30 chairs and at most 20 tables. Given that the profit on each chair is $100 and on each table is $200, determine how many of each item the company should produce to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nThe constraints for the lumber are:\n30x + 50y ≤ 1000 (maple lumber)\n20x + 40y ≤ 800 (cherry lumber)\n\nThe constraints for the market demand are:\nx ≤ 30 (chairs)\ny ≤ 20 (tables)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP(x, y) = 100x + 200y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints. The feasible region is a polygon with the following vertices: (0, 0), (0, 20), (30, 0), (20, 10), and (10, 20).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit:\n\nP(0, 0) = 100(0) + 200(0) = $0\nP(0, 20) = 100(0) + 200(20) = $4000\nP(30, 0) = 100(30) + 200(0) = $3000\nP(20, 10) = 100(20) + 200(10) = $4000\nP(10, 20) = 100(10) + 200(20) = $5000\n\nThe maximum profit of $5000 is achieved when the company produces 10 chairs and 20 tables."
