    "message_1": "A student wants to pack their backpack with the maximum weight of 15 kg. There are five items with different weights: 2 kg, 3 kg, 4 kg, 5 kg, and 7 kg. Each item also has a corresponding value: $50, $90, $120, $140, and $160, respectively. What is the optimal combination of items that the student can pack in their backpack to maximize the total value? Use the Knapsack Problem and show your solution step by step.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming. We will create a table with rows representing the items and columns representing the possible weights from 0 to 15 kg. The cell at the intersection of a row and a column will represent the maximum value that can be obtained using the items up to that row and with the given weight limit.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the table\nCreate a table with 6 rows (including a row for 0 items) and 16 columns (from 0 to 15 kg).\n\nStep 2: Fill in the table\nFor each cell, we will compare two options:\n1. Not including the current item (i.e., taking the value from the cell above)\n2. Including the current item (i.e., taking the value of the current item plus the value from the cell above and to the left by the weight of the current item)\n\nWe will choose the option that gives the maximum value.\n\nHere's the filled table:\n\n```\n  | 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n--+----------------------------------------------\n0 | 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n2 | 0  0 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50\n3 | 0  0 50 90 90 140 140 140 140 140 140 140 140 140 140 140\n4 | 0  0 50 90 120 140 180 210 210 210 210 210 210 210 210 210\n5 | 0  0 50 90 120 140 180 210 240 250 290 290 290 290 290 290\n7 | 0  0 50 90 120 140 180 210 240 250 290 310 340 350 390 390\n```\n\nStep 3: Find the optimal combination\nThe maximum value that can be obtained is in the bottom-right cell, which is $390. To find the items that make up this value, we will backtrack through the table:\n\n1. Start at the bottom-right cell (7 kg, 15 kg): value = 390\n2. Compare with the cell above (5 kg, 15 kg): value = 290. Since the values are different, the 7 kg item is included. Subtract the weight of the 7 kg item from the column index: 15 - 7 = 8.\n3. Move to the cell above and to the left by the weight of the 7 kg item (5 kg, 8 kg): value = 240\n4. Compare with the cell above (4 kg, 8 kg): value = 210. Since the values are different, the 5 kg item is included. Subtract the weight of the 5 kg item from the column index: 8 - 5 = 3.\n5. Move to the cell above and to the left by the weight of the 5 kg item (3 kg, 3 kg): value = 90\n6. Compare with the cell above (2 kg, 3 kg): value = 50. Since the values are different, the 3 kg item is included.\n\nThe optimal combination of items is 3 kg, 5 kg, and 7 kg, with a total value of $390."
