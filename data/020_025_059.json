The driver knows the distance between each pair of locations and wants to find the shortest route to deliver all packages and return to the starting point. Use optimization techniques to find the optimal route for the driver.\n\nHere are the distances between the locations in miles:\n\n- Location A to B: 3\n- Location A to C: 6\n- Location A to D: 7\n- Location A to E: 9\n- Location B to C: 2\n- Location B to D: 5\n- Location B to E: 8\n- Location C to D: 3\n- Location C to E: 7\n- Location D to E: 4\n\nWhat is the shortest distance that the driver can travel to deliver all packages and return to the starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible routes and calculating their total distances. Since there are 5 locations, there are 4! (4 factorial) possible routes starting from location A. These routes are:\n\n1. A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> A\n2. A -> B -> C -> E -> D -> A\n3. A -> B -> D -> C -> E -> A\n4. A -> B -> D -> E -> C -> A\n5. A -> B -> E -> C -> D -> A\n6. A -> B -> E -> D -> C -> A\n7. A -> C -> B -> D -> E -> A\n8. A -> C -> B -> E -> D -> A\n9. A -> C -> D -> B -> E -> A\n10.
