    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct subgroups K of order 9 in G such that HK is a subgroup of G, we will use the following concepts from group theory: Lagrange's theorem, Sylow theorems, and the product formula for the order of a product of subgroups.\n\nFirst, let's recall Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup H of a finite group G divides the order of G. Since the order of G is 72 and the order of H is 8, we know that the order of K must divide 72 as well. Since we are looking for subgroups of order 9, we can conclude that K must be a 9-Sylow subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's use the Sylow theorems to determine the number of 9-Sylow subgroups in G. The third Sylow theorem states that the number of 9-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_9, must divide the order of G and must be congruent to 1 modulo 9. The order of G is 72 = 2^3 * 3^2, so the possible values for n_9 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. However, since n_9 must be congruent to 1 modulo 9, the only possible value for n_9 is 1. Therefore, there is exactly one 9-Sylow subgroup K in G.\n\nNow, we need to check if HK is a subgroup of G. To do this, we will use the product formula for the order of a product of subgroups, which states that |HK| = |H| * |K| / |H ∩ K|. Since H and K are subgroups of orders 8 and 9, respectively, and their orders are relatively prime (i.e., gcd(8, 9) = 1), their intersection must be the identity element, so |H ∩ K| = 1. Therefore, |HK| = (8 * 9) / 1 = 72, which is the order of G.\n\nSince HK has the same order as G and is a subset of G, HK must be a subgroup of G by Lagrange's theorem. Thus, there is exactly one distinct subgroup K of order 9 in G such that HK is a subgroup of G."
