    "message_1": "Suppose Sarah and Tom are planning a date night. Sarah would like to go to a concert, while Tom would prefer to watch a movie. For each, their highest preference is to go to the concert together or watch the movie together, but their lowest preference is to each do their preferred activity alone. If they get the same preference, they get each 10 points. If they get the second preference, they get 5 in case they end up together. If they end up doing the activity they do not like, they get 0. What should each of them do to maximize their points, assuming they cannot communicate with each other before making their decision?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their points, we can analyze the possible outcomes using a payoff matrix. Let C represent going to a concert and M represent watching a movie. The possible outcomes are:\n\n1. Both choose C: (10, 10)\n2. Both choose M: (10, 10)\n3. Sarah chooses C, Tom chooses M: (0, 0)\n4. Sarah chooses M, Tom chooses C: (0, 0)\n\nThe payoff matrix looks like this:\n\n          Tom\n         |  C  |  M  |\n----------------------\nSarah C | 10,10| 0,0 |\n----------------------\n       M | 0,0  |10,10|\n\nSince they cannot communicate, they should choose the option that maximizes their points regardless of the other person's choice. This is known as the Nash equilibrium.\n\nFor Sarah, if Tom chooses C, she should choose C to get 10 points. If Tom chooses M, she should choose M to get 10 points. Similarly, for Tom, if Sarah chooses C, he should choose C to get 10 points. If Sarah chooses M, he should choose M to get 10 points.\n\nThus, the Nash equilibrium is for both of them to choose their preferred activity (Sarah chooses C, Tom chooses M) and hope that the other person also chooses the same activity. This way, they have a chance of getting 10 points if they both end up choosing the same activity, but they risk getting 0 points if they choose different activities. However, since they cannot communicate, this is the best strategy to maximize their points."
