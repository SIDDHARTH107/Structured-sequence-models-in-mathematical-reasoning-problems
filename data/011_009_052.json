    "message_2": "In a competition with 7 teams and no ties, we can use the concept of permutations to determine the number of different ways the competition can end. \n\nA permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. In this case, we want to arrange the 7 teams in order from 1st place to 7th place. \n\nThe number of permutations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of objects (teams) and r is the number of objects we want to arrange (also teams, since we want to arrange all of them).\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and r = 7.\n\nP(7, 7) = 7! / (7 - 7)!\n\nP(7, 7) = 7! / 0!\n\nSince 0! is equal to 1:\n\nP(7, 7) = 7!\n\nNow, we just need to calculate 7! (7 factorial):\n\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040\n\nSo, there are 5040 different ways the competition can end with no ties."
