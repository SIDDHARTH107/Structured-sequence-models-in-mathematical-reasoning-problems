    "message_2": "a) To find the coefficients of the Laurent series expansion, we first rewrite the function f(z) in terms of (z - 3i):\n\nf(z) = z^2 / (z - 3i) = ((z - 3i) + 3i)^2 / (z - 3i)\n\nNow, we can expand the numerator and simplify:\n\nf(z) = ((z - 3i)^2 + 6i(z - 3i) + 9i^2) / (z - 3i)\n\nf(z) = ((z - 3i)^2 - 18i(z - 3i) - 9) / (z - 3i)\n\nNow, we can write f(z) as a Laurent series:\n\nf(z) = (z - 3i) - 18i + (9 / (z - 3i))\n\nThe coefficients of the Laurent series expansion are:\n\na_(-1) = 9\na_0 = -18i\na_1 = 1\n\nb) The radius of convergence of the series is infinite, as there are no other singularities in the complex plane.\n\nc) The singularity at z = 3i is a simple pole, as the function has a term with a negative exponent in its Laurent series expansion.\n\nd) The series converges absolutely for all values of z in the complex plane except z = 3i, where the function has a simple pole. The series converges conditionally for z = 3i, and it does not diverge for any value of z."
