    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal that is formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of triangles in each level of the Sierpinski pyramid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the level of the pyramid.\n\nFor the 8th level of the Sierpinski pyramid, the number of triangles would be:\n\nNumber of triangles = 4^8 = 65,536"
