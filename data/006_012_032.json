    "message_1": "What is the probability that a burglary will occur during a given month in a neighborhood with a population of 10,000 people, knowing that the average number of burglaries per month is 20 and follows a Poisson distribution?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a burglary occurring during a given month in the neighborhood, we can use the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x events occurring, λ is the average number of events (in this case, burglaries) per month, and x! is the factorial of x.\n\nIn this problem, λ = 20 (the average number of burglaries per month). We want to find the probability of at least one burglary occurring during a given month, so we can find the probability of no burglaries occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nTo find the probability of no burglaries (x = 0):\n\nP(0) = (e^(-20) * 20^0) / 0!\nP(0) = (e^(-20) * 1) / 1\nP(0) ≈ 0.00000000206\n\nNow, we'll subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one burglary occurring:\n\nP(at least 1) = 1 - P(0)\nP(at least 1) ≈ 1 - 0.00000000206\nP(at least 1) ≈ 0.99999999794\n\nSo, the probability that a burglary will occur during a given month in the neighborhood is approximately 0.99999999794, or 99.999999794%."
