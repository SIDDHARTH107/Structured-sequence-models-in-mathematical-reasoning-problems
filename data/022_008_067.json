    "message_2": "The function $f(z) = e^{z^2}$ is a composition of two functions: $g(z) = z^2$ and $h(z) = e^z$. Both of these functions are entire, meaning they are analytic on the entire complex plane.\n\nThe function $g(z) = z^2$ is a polynomial, and all polynomials are entire functions. The function $h(z) = e^z$ is also entire, as it can be represented by its power series expansion:\n\n$$e^z = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}$$\n\nThis power series converges for all complex numbers $z$. Since both $g(z)$ and $h(z)$ are entire, their composition $f(z) = e^{z^2}$ is also entire. Therefore, the function $f(z) = e^{z^2}$ is entire for all complex numbers $z$."
