    "message_2": "In second-order logic, we can quantify over both objects (integers in this case) and relations (such as addition). To determine if the statement \"For all integers a and b, a+b = b+a\" is true, we can use the commutative property of addition.\n\nThe commutative property of addition states that for any two integers a and b, the order in which they are added does not affect their sum. In other words, a + b = b + a.\n\nLet's express this property in second-order logic:\n\n∀a, b ∈ ℤ (a + b = b + a)\n\nHere, ∀ denotes \"for all,\" and ℤ represents the set of integers. The statement asserts that for all integers a and b, a + b is equal to b + a.\n\nSince the commutative property of addition is a well-established mathematical fact, we can conclude that the statement \"For all integers a and b, a+b = b+a\" is true in second-order logic."
