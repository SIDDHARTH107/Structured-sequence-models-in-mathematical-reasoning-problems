    "message_2": "To find a generator for the subgroup H, we need to find an element in H that can generate all other elements in H by taking its powers. Since G is a cyclic group generated by 7, we can represent the elements of H in terms of powers of 7.\n\nH = {1, 7, 49, 343, 2401, 16807} = {7^0, 7^1, 7^2, 7^3, 7^4, 7^5}\n\nNow, let's find a generator for H. We can start by checking if 7 can generate all elements in H.\n\n7^0 = 1 (mod 16807)\n7^1 = 7 (mod 16807)\n7^2 = 49 (mod 16807)\n7^3 = 343 (mod 16807)\n7^4 = 2401 (mod 16807)\n7^5 = 16807 (mod 16807)\n\nAs we can see, 7 can generate all elements in H. Therefore, the generator for the subgroup H is 7.\n\nNow, we need to prove that H is a cyclic subgroup of G. Since H is generated by 7, which is also a generator of G, H is a cyclic subgroup of G. To further prove this, we can show that the order of H divides the order of G.\n\nThe order of G is the smallest positive integer n such that 7^n = 1 (mod 16807). Since 7 is a generator of G, the order of G is the smallest positive integer n such that 7^n = 1 (mod 16807).\n\nThe order of H is the smallest positive integer m such that 7^m = 1 (mod 16807). Since 7 is a generator of H, the order of H is the smallest positive integer m such that 7^m = 1 (mod 16807).\n\nFrom the elements of H, we can see that the order of H is 6, as there are 6 elements in H. Now, we need to find the order of G. Since G is generated by 7, we can use the fact that the order of an element in a group divides the order of the group.\n\nLet n be the order of G. Then, 7^n = 1 (mod 16807). Since 7^6 = 16807 (mod 16807), we can see that the order of G is a multiple of 6. Therefore, the order of H (which is 6) divides the order of G, and H is a cyclic subgroup of G."
