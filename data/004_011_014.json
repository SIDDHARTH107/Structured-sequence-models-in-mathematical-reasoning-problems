    "message_2": "Let V be the volume of the water in the cylindrical container, h be the height of the water, and r be the radius of the container. We are given that r = 5 cm and the container is being filled at a rate of dV/dt = 2 cm³/s.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h. Since the radius of the container is constant, we can write the volume of the water as V = π(5 cm)²h = 25πh.\n\nNow, we need to find the rate at which the water level is rising, which is dh/dt. To do this, we'll differentiate both sides of the volume equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = d(25πh)/dt\n\nWe know dV/dt = 2 cm³/s, so:\n\n2 = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we need to find dh/dt when the height of the water is 4 cm:\n\n2 = 25π(dh/dt) when h = 4 cm\n\nTo solve for dh/dt, divide both sides by 25π:\n\ndh/dt = 2 / (25π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ 0.02546 cm/s\n\nSo, when the height of the water is 4 cm, the water level is rising at a rate of approximately 0.02546 cm/s."
