    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 60, and let Z(G) be its center. Since Z(G) is non-trivial, there exists an element x in Z(G) with order greater than 1. Let the order of x be m, then m divides 60 (by Lagrange's theorem). The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5, so m can be one of {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60}. \n\nCase 1: m = 60\nIf the order of x is 60, then G is a cyclic group generated by x, and G is isomorphic to C60.\n\nCase 2: m ≠ 60\nIf the order of x is not 60, then m must be a proper divisor of 60. Let H be a subgroup of G generated by x, then |H| = m. Since x is in the center of G, H is a normal subgroup of G. By the factor group theorem, we have a factor group G/H.\n\nNow, |G/H| = |G|/|H| = 60/m. Since m is a proper divisor of 60, |G/H| > 1. Let y be an element in G that is not in H, and let K be the subgroup generated by y. Then, |K| = n, where n divides (60/m). Notice that H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element, because the orders of x and y are coprime.\n\nNow, consider the product HK = {hk | h in H, k in K}. Since |H| = m and |K| = n, we have |HK| = mn. Also, since H ∩ K = {e}, we have |G| = |HK| = mn. Thus, G is the internal direct product of H and K, i.e., G is isomorphic to H × K.\n\nSince H is a cyclic group of order m, it is isomorphic to Cm. Now, we need to show that K is a non-abelian group of order 30/m. Since |K| = n = 30/m, we have |K| = 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, or 30. If |K| = 2, then G is isomorphic to Cm × C2, which is a direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a non-abelian group of order 30/m.\n\nIf |K| > 2, then K must be non-abelian, because otherwise G would be abelian and its center would be the whole group, which contradicts the assumption that Z(G) is non-trivial. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a non-abelian group of order 30/m.\n\nIn conclusion, if the center of G is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60 or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a non-abelian group of order 30."
