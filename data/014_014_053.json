    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\" using the Playfair cipher method with the key \"QUADRATIC\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 matrix using the key \"QUADRATIC\" and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   Q U A D R\n   T I C B E\n   F G H K L\n   M N O P S\n   V W X Y Z\n\n2. Split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\n   MA TH EM AT IC SX IS FU NX\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if needed).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if needed).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\n   Encrypted digraphs:\n   MA -> QD\n   TH -> YK\n   EM -> UH\n   AT -> DR\n   IC -> BE\n   SX -> YW\n   IS -> KL\n   FU -> GT\n   NX -> ZW\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the encrypted message:\n\n   QDYKUHDRBEYWKLGTYWZW\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the Playfair cipher method with the key \"QUADRATIC\" is \"QDYKUHDRBEYWKLGTYWZW\"."
