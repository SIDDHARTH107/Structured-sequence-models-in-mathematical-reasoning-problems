    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ. The general formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a₀/2 + Σ[aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity, and the coefficients are given by:\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)dx] from -π to π\naₙ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)cos(nx)dx] from -π to π\nbₙ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)sin(nx)dx] from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)dx] from -π to π\nSince f(x) = 0 for -π < x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for 0 < x < π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na₀ = (1/π)[∫(0 dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(1 dx) from 0 to π]\na₀ = (1/π)[0 + (x)| from 0 to π]\na₀ = (1/π)(π - 0)\na₀ = 1\n\nNow let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)cos(nx)dx] from -π to π\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\naₙ = (1/π)[∫(0*cos(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(1*cos(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\naₙ = (1/π)[0 + ∫(cos(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\naₙ = (1/π)[(sin(nx)/n)| from 0 to π]\naₙ = (1/π)[(sin(nπ)/n - sin(0)/n)]\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, aₙ = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)sin(nx)dx] from -π to π\nSplitting the integral into two parts:\n\nbₙ = (1/π)[∫(0*sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(1*sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\nbₙ = (1/π)[0 + ∫(sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\nbₙ = (1/π)[(-cos(nx)/n)| from 0 to π]\nbₙ = (1/π)[(-cos(nπ)/n + cos(0)/n)]\nbₙ = (1/π)[(-1)^n/n - 1/n]\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ[((-1)^n/n - 1/n)sin(nx)] for n=1 to infinity\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x)."
