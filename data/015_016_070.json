Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Chua circuit, we need to numerically solve the given set of differential equations and compute the Lyapunov exponents. This can be done using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method for solving the differential equations and the Wolf's algorithm for computing the Lyapunov exponents.\n\nHowever, this task requires a numerical computation that cannot be performed directly in this text-based environment. You can use programming languages like Python with libraries such as NumPy and SciPy to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.linalg import norm\n\ndef chua(t, X, alpha, beta, gamma, m, m0):\n    x, y, z = X\n    f_x = m * x + 0.5 * (m - m0) * (abs(x + 1) - abs(x - 1))\n    dxdt = alpha * (y - x - f_x)\n    dydt = x - y + z\n    dzdt = -beta * y - gamma * z\n    return [dxdt, dydt, dzdt]\n\ndef lyapunov_exponent(t, X, alpha, beta, gamma, m, m0):\n    # Solve the Chua circuit equations\n    sol = solve_ivp(chua, (t[0], t[-1]), X, args=(alpha, beta, gamma, m, m0), t_eval=t)\n    \n    # Compute the Lyapunov exponent using Wolf's algorithm\n    # (This part is left for you to implement)\n    # ...\n\nalpha = 15.6\nbeta = 28\ngamma = 10\nm = 0.5\nm0 = -1\ninitial_conditions = [0.1, 0, 0]\nt = np.linspace(0, 100, 10000)\n\n# Compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent\n# (This part is left for you to implement)\n# ...\n```\n\nOnce you have implemented the missing parts and run the code, you will obtain the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Chua circuit, which you can then round to two decimal places."
