    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - i)^3 counterclockwise around the circle |z - i| = 2, we can use the Cauchy Integral Formula. The Cauchy Integral Formula states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, the integral of f(z) around C is given by:\n\n∮(f(z) / (z - z₀)^n) dz = (2πi / (n - 1)!) * f^(n-1)(z₀)\n\nwhere z₀ is a point inside C, n is a positive integer, and f^(n-1)(z₀) denotes the (n-1)th derivative of f evaluated at z₀.\n\nIn our case, f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - i)^3, and the contour C is the circle |z - i| = 2. The point z₀ = i is inside the contour, and we have n = 3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the second derivative of f(z) with respect to z. Let g(z) = z^2 - 1 and h(z) = (z - i)^3. Then f(z) = g(z) / h(z). We can use the quotient rule to find the derivatives of f(z):\n\nf'(z) = (g'(z) * h(z) - g(z) * h'(z)) / h(z)^2\nf''(z) = (g''(z) * h(z) - 2 * g'(z) * h'(z) + g(z) * h''(z)) / h(z)^3\n\nNow, we compute the derivatives of g(z) and h(z):\n\ng'(z) = 2z\ng''(z) = 2\n\nh'(z) = 3(z - i)^2\nh''(z) = 6(z - i)\n\nNow, we can plug these derivatives into the expression for f''(z):\n\nf''(z) = (2 * (z - i)^3 - 2 * 2z * 3(z - i)^2 + (z^2 - 1) * 6(z - i)) / (z - i)^6\n\nNow, we evaluate f''(z) at z₀ = i:\n\nf''(i) = (2 * (i - i)^3 - 2 * 2i * 3(i - i)^2 + (i^2 - 1) * 6(i - i)) / (i - i)^6\nf''(i) = (2 * 0 - 0 + (-2) * 6 * 0) / 0^6\nf''(i) = 0\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy Integral Formula to find the integral of f(z) around the contour C:\n\n∮(f(z) / (z - i)^3) dz = (2πi / (3 - 1)!) * f''(i)\n∮(f(z) / (z - i)^3) dz = (2πi / 2) * 0\n∮(f(z) / (z - i)^3) dz = 0\n\nSo, the integral of f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - i)^3 counterclockwise around the circle |z - i| = 2 is 0."
