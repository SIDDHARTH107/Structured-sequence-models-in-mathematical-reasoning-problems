    "message_2": "First, we will simplify the trigonometric expression, and then we will substitute x = π/6.\n\nGiven expression: (2sin²(x) + sin(x) - 1) / (sin(x) - 1)\n\nWe can notice that the numerator is a quadratic expression in terms of sin(x). Let's try to factor it:\n\n2sin²(x) + sin(x) - 1\n\nWe are looking for two numbers that multiply to -2 (coefficient of sin²(x) multiplied by the constant term) and add up to 1 (coefficient of sin(x)).\n\nThese two numbers are 2 and -1. So, we can rewrite the middle term as:\n\n2sin²(x) + 2sin(x) - sin(x) - 1\n\nNow, we can factor by grouping:\n\n2sin(x)(sin(x) + 1) - 1(sin(x) + 1)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term (sin(x) + 1):\n\n(sin(x) + 1)(2sin(x) - 1)\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n(sin(x) + 1)(2sin(x) - 1) / (sin(x) - 1)\n\nNow, let's substitute x = π/6:\n\n(sin(π/6) + 1)(2sin(π/6) - 1) / (sin(π/6) - 1)\n\nWe know that sin(π/6) = 1/2. Substituting this value:\n\n(1/2 + 1)(2(1/2) - 1) / (1/2 - 1)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(3/2)(1 - 1) / (-1/2)\n\nThe term (1 - 1) in the numerator becomes 0:\n\n(3/2)(0) / (-1/2)\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 0."
