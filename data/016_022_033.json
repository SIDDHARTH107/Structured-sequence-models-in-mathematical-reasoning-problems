    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle 3D, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of equilateral triangles in each layer can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles in layer n = 4^(n-1)\n\nTo find the total number of equilateral triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid of 5 layers, we need to sum the number of triangles in each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4^(1-1) = 4^0 = 1\nLayer 2: 4^(2-1) = 4^1 = 4\nLayer 3: 4^(3-1) = 4^2 = 16\nLayer 4: 4^(4-1) = 4^3 = 64\nLayer 5: 4^(5-1) = 4^4 = 256\n\nTotal number of equilateral triangles = 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 = 341"
