    "message_2": "To solve the inequality -5x + 7 < 12, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 7 from both sides of the inequality.\n-5x + 7 - 7 < 12 - 7\n-5x < 5\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the inequality by -5. Remember to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number.\n-5x / -5 > 5 / -5\nx > -1\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x > -1."
