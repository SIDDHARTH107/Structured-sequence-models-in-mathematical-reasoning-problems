    "message_2": "1. To find the degree of the algebraic curve, we need to find the highest total degree of any term in the equation. The equation is given by $y^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x$. The highest total degree of any term in this equation is 3, which comes from the term $x^3$. Therefore, the degree of this algebraic curve is 3.\n\n2. To find the singular points of this curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both of these partial derivatives are zero. The equation is given by $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x = 0$. The partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 4x + 5$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both of these partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$-3x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nSolving the second equation, we get $y = 0$. Now, we need to find the corresponding x values:\n\n$-3x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(-3)(5)}}{2(-3)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{76}}{-6}$\n\nSo, the singular points are $(\\frac{4 + \\sqrt{76}}{-6}, 0)$ and $(\\frac{4 - \\sqrt{76}}{-6}, 0)$.\n\n3. To show that this algebraic curve has a minimal model, we need to find a birational transformation that eliminates the singular points. We can perform a change of variables to eliminate the singular points:\n\nLet $x' = x - \\frac{2}{3}$ and $y' = y$. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$y'^2 = (x' + \\frac{2}{3})^3 + 2(x' + \\frac{2}{3})^2 - 5(x' + \\frac{2}{3})$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$y'^2 = x'^3 - \\frac{5}{3}x'^2 - \\frac{20}{27}x' + \\frac{56}{81}$\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x'$ and $y'$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x'} = -3x'^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x' - \\frac{20}{27}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = 2y'$\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:\n\n$-3x'^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x' - \\frac{20}{27} = 0$\n\n$2y' = 0$\n\nSolving the second equation, we get $y' = 0$. Now, we need to find the corresponding $x'$ values:\n\n$-3x'^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x' - \\frac{20}{27} = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x' = \\frac{-(-\\frac{10}{3}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-\\frac{10}{3})^2 - 4(-3)(-\\frac{20}{27})}}{2(-3)}$\n\n$x' = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{9} - \\frac{80}{9}}}{-6}$\n\n$x' = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{20}{9}}}{-6}$\n\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots for $x'$. However, these roots do not correspond to the singular points of the original curve, as they are related to the transformed variables $x'$ and $y'$. Therefore, the transformed curve has no singular points, and the original curve has a minimal model."
