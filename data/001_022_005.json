    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 90\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 - 27(0) + 90\n\nLet's first find the y-intercept:\n\ny = 0 - 0 - 0 + 90\ny = 90\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 90).\n\nNow let's find the x-intercepts:\n\n0 = x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 90\n\nWe can try to factor this polynomial or use numerical methods to find the roots. Let's try factoring by grouping:\n\n0 = x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 90\n0 = x^2(x - 6) - 27(x - 6)\n\nNow we can factor out the common term (x - 6):\n\n0 = (x - 6)(x^2 - 27)\n\nNow we have a quadratic factor (x^2 - 27) which can be factored further as a difference of squares:\n\n0 = (x - 6)(x + 3)(x - 3)\n\nNow we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 6 = 0 => x = 6\nx + 3 = 0 => x = -3\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are (-3, 0), (3, 0), and (6, 0)."
