Use Cauchy's theorem to solve it.\n\nOne possible numerical problem can be:\n\nEvaluate the integral ∮C(z^2 + 2z + 1)dz where C is the closed path formed by the circle of radius 2 centered at z = 1, oriented counterclockwise.",
    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (i.e., holomorphic) on a simply connected domain, then the integral of that function along any closed path in that domain is zero.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1 is a polynomial, and polynomials are holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is holomorphic on the simply connected domain containing the closed path C.\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic on the domain containing C, by Cauchy's theorem, the integral of f(z) along the closed path C is zero:\n\n∮C(z^2 + 2z + 1)dz = 0"
