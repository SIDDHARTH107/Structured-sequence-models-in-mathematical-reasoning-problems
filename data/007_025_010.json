    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to know the common base (g) and the common modulus (p) used by both parties A and B. Let's assume g and p are given.\n\n1. Party A has a private key (a) of 7 and a public key (A) of 3. So, A = g^a mod p = 3.\n2. Party B has a private key (b) of 11 and a public key (B) of 5. So, B = g^b mod p = 5.\n\nNow, both parties can compute the shared secret key (s) as follows:\n\n- Party A computes s = B^a mod p = 5^7 mod p.\n- Party B computes s = A^b mod p = 3^11 mod p.\n\nSince both calculations result in the same value, the shared secret key (s) is equal to 5^7 mod p = 3^11 mod p."
