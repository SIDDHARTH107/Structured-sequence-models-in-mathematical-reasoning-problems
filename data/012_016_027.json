    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the graph, we first need to determine the graph structure from the adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix represents the following graph:\n\n```\n1 -- 2\n|\\  |\n| \\ |\n3 -- 4\n```\n\nThe graph has 4 vertices and 5 edges. It is a simple connected graph with one cycle. Now, we can compute the Tutte polynomial using the recursive formula:\n\n$$T_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y)$$\n\nWhere $T_G(x, y)$ is the Tutte polynomial of graph $G$, $G-e$ is the graph obtained by deleting edge $e$, and $G/e$ is the graph obtained by contracting edge $e$.\n\nLet's choose edge 1-2 for the recursion:\n\n1. $G-e$: Remove edge 1-2, resulting in a tree with 4 vertices and 4 edges.\n2. $G/e$: Contract edge 1-2, resulting in a graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges, which is also a tree.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for a tree with $n$ vertices is given by:\n\n$$T_T(x, y) = x^{n-1}$$\n\nSo, for both $G-e$ and $G/e$, we have:\n\n$$T_{G-e}(x, y) = x^{3}$$\n$$T_{G/e}(x, y) = x^{2}$$\n\nNow, using the recursive formula:\n\n$$T_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y) = x^3 + x^2$$\n\nThus, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\n$$T_G(x, y) = x^3 + x^2$$"
