    "message_1": "Suppose that in a certain country, the probability of a political party winning an election is 0.55. If there are three major political parties in the country, what is the probability that at least two of them will win in the next election?",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we are asked to find the probability that at least two of the three major political parties will win in the next election. Since there can only be one winner in an election, it is not possible for two or more parties to win simultaneously. Therefore, the probability that at least two of them will win in the next election is 0."
