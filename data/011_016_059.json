    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways the team can select which 5 games to play at their home ground and which 5 games to play at their opponent's ground, we can use the combination formula. \n\nThe combination formula is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of games and k is the number of games to be played at the home ground.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (total number of games) and k = 5 (number of games to be played at the home ground).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 ways for the team to select which 5 games to play at their home ground and which 5 games to play at their opponent's ground."
