    "message_1": "Suppose a company has three machines A, B and C that are used to produce a product. Machine A takes 2 hours to produce 5 units of product, machine B takes 3 hours to produce 4 units of product and machine C takes 4 hours to produce 9 units of product. If the company has 50 hours of production time available each week, how many units of the product can be produced to maximize the production output?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the production output, we need to find the production rate (units per hour) for each machine and then allocate the available 50 hours of production time accordingly.\n\nMachine A:\nProduction rate = 5 units / 2 hours = 2.5 units per hour\n\nMachine B:\nProduction rate = 4 units / 3 hours ≈ 1.33 units per hour\n\nMachine C:\nProduction rate = 9 units / 4 hours = 2.25 units per hour\n\nSince Machine A has the highest production rate, we should allocate as much time as possible to it. However, we also need to consider the other machines to maximize the overall output.\n\nLet's start by allocating all 50 hours to Machine A:\n50 hours * 2.5 units per hour = 125 units\n\nNow, let's see if we can improve the output by allocating some time to the other machines. We can try different combinations of hours for each machine, but we need to make sure the total hours do not exceed 50.\n\nOne possible combination is:\nMachine A: 48 hours (24 cycles of 2 hours each)\nMachine B: 3 hours (1 cycle)\nMachine C: 0 hours\n\nTotal units produced = (24 * 5) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 9) = 120 + 4 = 124 units\n\nAnother possible combination is:\nMachine A: 46 hours (23 cycles of 2 hours each)\nMachine B: 3 hours (1 cycle)\nMachine C: 1 hour (1/4 cycle)\n\nTotal units produced = (23 * 5) + (1 * 4) + (1/4 * 9) = 115 + 4 + 2.25 ≈ 121.25 units\n\nAs we can see, the first combination (48 hours for Machine A and 3 hours for Machine B) gives us the maximum output of 124 units. Therefore, the company can produce 124 units of the product to maximize the production output with the given 50 hours of production time."
