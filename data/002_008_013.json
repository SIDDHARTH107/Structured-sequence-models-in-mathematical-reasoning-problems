    "message_1": "What is the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm?",
    "message_2": "The volume of a cone can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (1/3)π(5)²(12)\n\nV = (1/3)π(25)(12)\n\nV = (1/3)π(300)\n\nV = 100π\n\nThe volume of the cone is 100π cubic centimeters, or approximately 314.16 cubic centimeters."
