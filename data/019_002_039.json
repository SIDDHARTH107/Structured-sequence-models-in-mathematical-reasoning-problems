    "message_2": "The statement ∀ x ∈ Z, ∃ y ∈ Z such that P(x,y) is true.\n\nFor every integer x, there exists an integer y such that x is divisible by y. This is because every integer x is divisible by 1 and itself (x). So, for any given x, you can always find a y (either 1 or x) that satisfies the predicate P(x,y)."
