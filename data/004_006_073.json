    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2, we first need to find its first derivative and then set it equal to zero to solve for x.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x\n\nWe can factor out a 4x from the equation:\n\n0 = 4x(x^2 - 3x + 3)\n\nNow, we have two factors: 4x and (x^2 - 3x + 3). Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\n4x = 0 => x = 0\n\nx^2 - 3x + 3 = 0\n\nThe quadratic equation (x^2 - 3x + 3) does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -3, and c = 3:\n\nx = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (3 ± √(9 - 12)) / 2\nx = (3 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the quadratic equation has no real solutions.\n\nSo, the only critical point of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 is x = 0."
