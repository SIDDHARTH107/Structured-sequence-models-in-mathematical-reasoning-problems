    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of cardboard measures $16$ inches by $12$ inches. It has four identical square pieces, one from each corner, cut out. The remaining cardboard is then folded up to make an open-top box. What size should be cut out from the corners to make a box of maximum volume?",
    "message_2": "Let the side length of the square cut out from each corner be x inches. After cutting out the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the open-top box will be:\n\nLength: 16 - 2x inches\nWidth: 12 - 2x inches\nHeight: x inches\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as the product of its length, width, and height:\n\nV(x) = (16 - 2x)(12 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the volume function V(x) by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (16 - 2x)(12 - 2x)(1) + (16 - 2x)(-2)(x) + (12 - 2x)(-2)(x)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nV'(x) = -8x^3 + 56x^2 - 96x\n\nNow, we set V'(x) equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = -8x^3 + 56x^2 - 96x\n\nFactor out the common term x:\n\n0 = x(-8x^2 + 56x - 96)\n\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic equation -8x^2 + 56x - 96 = 0. We can divide the equation by -8 to simplify:\n\nx^2 - 7x + 12 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 4) = 0\n\nSo, the possible values of x are 3 and 4. However, since the width of the cardboard is 12 inches, cutting out squares of side length 4 inches would result in a box with no width. Therefore, the size of the squares that should be cut out from the corners to make a box of maximum volume is 3 inches."
