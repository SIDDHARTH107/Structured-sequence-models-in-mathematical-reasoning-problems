    "message_2": "To share the 7 apples equally among your three friends, you would divide the total number of apples by the number of friends. In this case, that would be 7 apples divided by 3 friends.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n7 ÷ 3 = 2 (remainder 1)\n\nSo, each friend would receive 2 apples, and there would be 1 apple left over.\n\nIn linear logic, using additive connectives, you can represent this problem as:\n\nA ⊕ B ⊕ C = 7\n\nwhere A, B, and C represent the number of apples each friend receives. Since each friend receives 2 apples, the equation would be:\n\n2 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 2 = 6\n\nHowever, there is still 1 apple left over, so the equation would be:\n\n2 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 1 = 7\n\nThis equation represents the distribution of apples among the three friends, taking into account the leftover apple."
