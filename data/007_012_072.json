    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem, we need to find the smallest prime number p for which (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nLet's start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\nFor p = 2, (p-1)! + 1 = (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSince 2 is divisible by 2, the smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem is 2."
