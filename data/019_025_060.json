    "message_1": "If the probability of a machine producing a defective product is 0.2, what is the probability that out of the next 5 products produced by the machine, exactly 2 will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- n is the total number of products (in this case, 5)\n- k is the number of defective products (in this case, 2)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (0.2)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective products from n total products, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = (5 choose 2) * (0.2)^2 * (1-0.2)^(5-2)\n\nFirst, we calculate (5 choose 2):\n\n(5 choose 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = 10 * (0.2)^2 * (0.8)^3\n\nP(X = 2) = 10 * 0.04 * 0.512\n\nP(X = 2) = 0.2048\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 out of the next 5 products produced by the machine will be defective is 0.2048 or 20.48%."
