    "message_1": "Consider two travelers who lose their luggage during a flight. They both have identical bags and the airline asks each traveler to independently write down the value of their lost luggage in dollars, between 0 and 100. If both values are the same, then the airline will compensate each traveler the amount they wrote down. But if the values are different, then the traveler who wrote down the lower value will receive the amount they wrote down, while the traveler who wrote down the higher value will receive an amount halfway between the two values.\n\nWhat is the optimal value that each traveler should write down to maximize their compensation?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem using game theory. We can model this situation as a two-player game, where each player (traveler) chooses a value between 0 and 100, and their payoff (compensation) depends on both players' choices.\n\nLet x be the value chosen by traveler A and y be the value chosen by traveler B. The payoff functions for both travelers are as follows:\n\nPayoff for traveler A:\n- If x = y, then payoff_A = x\n- If x < y, then payoff_A = x\n- If x > y, then payoff_A = (x + y) / 2\n\nPayoff for traveler B:\n- If x = y, then payoff_B = y\n- If x < y, then payoff_B = (x + y) / 2\n- If x > y, then payoff_B = y\n\nTo find the optimal value for each traveler, we need to find the Nash equilibrium of this game. A Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (values) for both players, such that no player can increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nIn this case, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both travelers choose the same value, as neither traveler can increase their payoff by choosing a different value. If traveler A chooses a higher value, their payoff will decrease, and if they choose a lower value, their payoff will not increase. The same applies to traveler B.\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal value for both travelers to choose. Since both travelers want to maximize their compensation, they should choose the highest possible value that is still a Nash equilibrium. In this case, that value is 100.\n\nSo, the optimal value for each traveler to write down to maximize their compensation is 100."
