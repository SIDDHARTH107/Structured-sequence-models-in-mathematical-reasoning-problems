    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 2$. We want to find the points (x, y) such that $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 6x + 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both of these expressions are equal to zero:\n\n$-3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nThe second equation gives us $y = 0$. Now, we need to find the corresponding x values. Plugging y = 0 into the first equation, we get:\n\n$-3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for x:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(-3)(2)}}{2(-3)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 24}}{-6}$\n\n$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{60}}{-6}$\n\nSo, we have two possible x values:\n\n$x_1 = \\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{-6}$\n\n$x_2 = \\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{-6}$\n\nThus, the singular points of the curve are:\n\n$(x_1, y) = \\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{-6}, 0\\right)$\n\n$(x_2, y) = \\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{-6}, 0\\right)$"
