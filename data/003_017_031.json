    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function over an interval, we can use the formula:\n\naverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) = 3sin(x), and the interval is [0, π/2]. So, a = 0 and b = π/2.\n\naverage value = (1/(π/2 - 0)) * ∫[0, π/2] 3sin(x) dx\n\naverage value = (2/π) * ∫[0, π/2] 3sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 3sin(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫3sin(x) dx = -3cos(x) + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral over the interval [0, π/2]:\n\n(-3cos(π/2) + C) - (-3cos(0) + C) = -3cos(π/2) - (-3cos(0))\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, we have:\n\n-3(0) - (-3(1)) = 3\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the average value formula:\n\naverage value = (2/π) * 3\n\naverage value = 6/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 3sin(x) over the interval [0, π/2] is a = 6/π."
