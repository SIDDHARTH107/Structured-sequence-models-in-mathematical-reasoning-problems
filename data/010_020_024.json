    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology of the torus knot T(3,4), we will use the knot Floer homology, which is a version of Floer homology specifically designed for knots. Knot Floer homology is an invariant of knots and links in three-manifolds and was introduced by Peter Ozsváth and Zoltán Szabó in 2004. It is a powerful tool for studying knot concordance and other knot invariants.\n\nThe torus knot T(3,4) is a knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in S^3. It has 3 loops around the meridian and 4 loops around the longitude of the torus. The knot Floer homology of a torus knot T(p,q) can be computed using the formula:\n\nHFK(T(p,q)) = ⊕_{i=0}^{pq-p-q} HFK(T(p,q), i),\n\nwhere HFK(T(p,q), i) denotes the knot Floer homology of T(p,q) in the ith Alexander grading.\n\nFor the torus knot T(3,4), we have p = 3 and q = 4. Thus, we need to compute the knot Floer homology for the Alexander gradings from 0 to (3*4 - 3 - 4) = 5.\n\nThe knot Floer homology of a torus knot T(p,q) in the ith Alexander grading is given by:\n\nHFK(T(p,q), i) = Z^{(p-1)(q-1) - i}.\n\nNow, we can compute the knot Floer homology of T(3,4) in each Alexander grading:\n\nHFK(T(3,4), 0) = Z^((3-1)(4-1) - 0) = Z^6,\nHFK(T(3,4), 1) = Z^((3-1)(4-1) - 1) = Z^5,\nHFK(T(3,4), 2) = Z^((3-1)(4-1) - 2) = Z^4,\nHFK(T(3,4), 3) = Z^((3-1)(4-1) - 3) = Z^3,\nHFK(T(3,4), 4) = Z^((3-1)(4-1) - 4) = Z^2,\nHFK(T(3,4), 5) = Z^((3-1)(4-1) - 5) = Z^1.\n\nFinally, we can compute the total knot Floer homology of T(3,4) by taking the direct sum of the homologies in each Alexander grading:\n\nHFK(T(3,4)) = HFK(T(3,4), 0) ⊕ HFK(T(3,4), 1) ⊕ HFK(T(3,4), 2) ⊕ HFK(T(3,4), 3) ⊕ HFK(T(3,4), 4) ⊕ HFK(T(3,4), 5)\n           = Z^6 ⊕ Z^5 ⊕ Z^4 ⊕ Z^3 ⊕ Z^2 ⊕ Z^1.\n\nThus, the Floer homology of the torus knot T(3,4) is Z^6 ⊕ Z^5 ⊕ Z^4 ⊕ Z^3 ⊕ Z^2 ⊕ Z^1."
