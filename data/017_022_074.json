    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to one of the following: C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow Theorems. Then, we will consider each case and prove that G is isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow Theorems, we know the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 ∈ {1, 3, 5, 15}.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 20 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 ∈ {1, 10}.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 12 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 ∈ {1, 6}.\n\nNow, let's consider each case:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIf G is abelian, then by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following: C60, C2 × C30, C3 × C20, or C2^2 × C3 × C5. However, if G is isomorphic to any of the latter three, it would have more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, which contradicts the fact that n_2 = 1. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C60.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIf G is non-abelian, then n_2 > 1. We will consider the cases n_2 = 3, 5, and 15 separately.\n\nCase 2.1: n_2 = 3.\nIf n_2 = 3, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 4. Let P_2 be one of these subgroups. Since the index of P_2 in G is 15, which is the smallest prime divisor of |G|, P_2 is a normal subgroup of G. Now, let P_3 and P_5 be Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G, respectively. Then, |P_3| = 3 and |P_5| = 5. Since P_2 is normal in G, we have that G = P_2P_3P_5. Moreover, since P_3 and P_5 are both cyclic, G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P_2, P_3, and P_5. There are 32 non-abelian groups of order 60 that can be formed as semidirect products of these subgroups, and G must be isomorphic to one of them.\n\nCase 2.2: n_2 = 5.\nIf n_2 = 5, then there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 4. Let P_2 be one of these subgroups. Since the index of P_2 in G is 15, which is the smallest prime divisor of |G|, P_2 is a normal subgroup of G. Now, let P_3 and P_5 be Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G, respectively. Then, |P_3| = 3 and |P_5| = 5. Since P_2 is normal in G, we have that G = P_2P_3P_5. Moreover, since P_3 and P_5 are both cyclic, G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P_2, P_3, and P_5. However, this case is not possible, as there are no groups of order 60 that can be formed as semidirect products of these subgroups with n_2 = 5.\n\nCase 2.3: n_2 = 15.\nIf n_2 = 15, then there are fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 4. Let P_2 be one of these subgroups. Since the index of P_2 in G is 4, which is not the smallest prime divisor of |G|, P_2 is not a normal subgroup of G. Now, let P_3 and P_5 be Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G, respectively. Then, |P_3| = 3 and |P_5| = 5. Since P_3 and P_5 are both cyclic, G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P_3 and P_5. In this case, G is isomorphic to A5 × C2.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following: C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
