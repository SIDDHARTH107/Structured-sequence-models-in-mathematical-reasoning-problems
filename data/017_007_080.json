    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of an element in a group divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem).\n2. A group of order p, where p is prime, is cyclic.\n3. A group with an element of order equal to the order of the group is cyclic.\n\nFirst, we note that the order of G is 6, which is not prime. However, 6 has prime divisors 2 and 3. By Cauchy's theorem, there must exist elements of order 2 and 3 in G. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup generated by b, denoted by <b>. Since b has order 3, <b> is a cyclic group of order 3. Moreover, since the order of <b> is 3, which is a prime number, <b> is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of the two elements a and b. Since a and b have different orders, they must be distinct elements. Let c = ab. We will now show that c has order 2.\n\n(c^2) = (ab)(ab) = a(ba)b, since a has order 2, a^2 = e (the identity element), and since b has order 3, b^3 = e.\n\nSince <b> is a normal subgroup, we have ba = b^n for some n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 (as b has order 3). If n = 1, then ba = b, which implies a = e, which is a contradiction since a has order 2. Therefore, n = 2, and ba = b^2.\n\nNow, (c^2) = a(ba)b = a(b^2)b = ab^3 = ae = a, which implies that c has order 2.\n\nNow, we have three elements in G: e, a, b, b^2, c, and bc. Since G has 6 elements, these must be all the elements in G. We can now define a multiplication table for G:\n\n|   | e  | a  | b  | b^2 | c  | bc |\n|---|----|----|----|-----|----|----|\n| e | e  | a  | b  | b^2 | c  | bc |\n| a | a  | e  | c  | bc  | b  | b^2|\n| b | b  | c  | b^2| e   | bc | a  |\n| b^2| b^2| bc | e  | b   | a  | c  |\n| c | c  | b  | bc | a   | e  | b^2|\n| bc| bc | b^2| a  | c   | b^2| e  |\n\nThis multiplication table is consistent with the orders of a, b, and c, and it is also consistent with the group axioms. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 (if there exists an element of order 6 in G) or the dihedral group D3 (if there are elements of order 2 and 3 in G)."
