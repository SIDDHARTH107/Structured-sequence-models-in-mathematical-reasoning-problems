The general equation for an elliptic curve is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + ax + b\n\nwhere a and b are constants.\n\nOnce we have the equation of the elliptic curve, we can use the following formulas to add the points A and B:\n\nIf A and B have different x-coordinates (x1 ≠ x2):\n\n1. Compute the slope: λ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n2. Compute the x-coordinate of the resulting point: x3 = λ^2 - x1 - x2\n3. Compute the y-coordinate of the resulting point: y3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1\n\nIf A and B have the same x-coordinate (x1 = x2) and different y-coordinates (y1 ≠ y2), then the resulting point is the point at infinity (O), which is the identity element for the elliptic curve group.\n\nIn this case, Point A = (3,6) and Point B = (3,7) have the same x-coordinate and different y-coordinates. Therefore, the result of adding these two points together on the elliptic curve is the point at infinity (O)."
