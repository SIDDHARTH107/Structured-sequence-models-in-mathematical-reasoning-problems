    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the given equation r(t) = (2t, 3t^2, 4t^3).\n\nFirst derivative (tangent vector):\nr'(t) = (2, 6t, 12t^2)\n\nSecond derivative (curvature vector):\nr''(t) = (0, 6, 24t)\n\nThird derivative (torsion vector):\nr'''(t) = (0, 0, 24)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these derivatives at the point where t = 1.\n\nr'(1) = (2, 6, 12)\nr''(1) = (0, 6, 24)\nr'''(1) = (0, 0, 24)\n\nNext, we will find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) using the following formulas:\n\nCurvature (k):\nk = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nTorsion (τ):\nτ = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (2, 6, 12) x (0, 6, 24)\n= (6 * 24 - 12 * 6, 12 * 0 - 2 * 24, 2 * 6 - 6 * 0)\n= (72, -48, 12)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of r'(t) and the cross product:\n\n||r'(t)|| = √(2^2 + 6^2 + 12^2) = √(4 + 36 + 144) = √184\n\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = √(72^2 + (-48)^2 + 12^2) = √(5184 + 2304 + 144) = √7632\n\nNow we can find the curvature (k):\n\nk = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\nk = √7632 / (√184)^3\nk ≈ 0.0701\n\nNext, let's find the dot product of the cross product and r'''(t):\n\n(r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) = (72, -48, 12) • (0, 0, 24)\n= 72 * 0 + (-48) * 0 + 12 * 24\n= 288\n\nNow we can find the torsion (τ):\n\nτ = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\nτ = 288 / (√7632)^2\nτ = 288 / 7632\nτ ≈ 0.0377\n\nSo, the curvature (k) at the point where t = 1 is approximately 0.0701, and the torsion (τ) is approximately 0.0377."
