The system is initially at rest, and then a force of F(t) = 3cos(2t) N is applied. \n\nFind the displacement equation of the system as a function of time, assuming that the displacement x(0) = 0 and the velocity v(0) = 0 at t = 0.",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement equation of the system, we first need to set up the equation of motion for the system. The equation of motion for a damped spring system with an external force is given by:\n\nm * x''(t) + c * x'(t) + k * x(t) = F(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, x'(t) is the velocity, x''(t) is the acceleration, and F(t) is the external force. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n0.5 * x''(t) + 0.2 * x'(t) + 4 * x(t) = 3cos(2t)\n\nNow, we need to find the complementary function and particular solution to solve this non-homogeneous second-order linear differential equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the complementary function by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\n0.5 * x''(t) + 0.2 * x'(t) + 4 * x(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\n0.5 * r^2 + 0.2 * r + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get two complex roots:\n\nr1 = -0.2/1 + sqrt((-0.2)^2 - 4 * 0.5 * 4) / (2 * 0.5) = -0.2/1 + 1.96i\nr2 = -0.2/1 - sqrt((-0.2)^2 - 4 * 0.5 * 4) / (2 * 0.5) = -0.2/1 - 1.96i\n\nThe complementary function is then given by:\n\nx_c(t) = e^(-0.2/1 * t) * (A * cos(1.96t) + B * sin(1.96t))\n\nNow, let's find the particular solution. Since the external force is a cosine function, we will assume a particular solution of the form:\n\nx_p(t) = C * cos(2t) + D * sin(2t)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives:\n\nx_p'(t) = -2C * sin(2t) + 2D * cos(2t)\nx_p''(t) = -4C * cos(2t) - 4D * sin(2t)\n\nPlugging x_p(t), x_p'(t), and x_p''(t) back into the original equation:\n\n0.5 * (-4C * cos(2t) - 4D * sin(2t)) + 0.2 * (-2C * sin(2t) + 2D * cos(2t)) + 4 * (C * cos(2t) + D * sin(2t)) = 3cos(2t)\n\nEquating the coefficients of cos(2t) and sin(2t), we get two equations:\n\n-2C + 0.4D + 4C = 3\n-2D - 0.4C + 4D = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nC = 0.6\nD = 0.3\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nx_p(t) = 0.6 * cos(2t) + 0.3 * sin(2t)\n\nNow, the general solution is the sum of the complementary function and the particular solution:\n\nx(t) = e^(-0.2/1 * t) * (A * cos(1.96t) + B * sin(1.96t)) + 0.6 * cos(2t) + 0.3 * sin(2t)\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = 0 => A + 0.6 = 0 => A = -0.6\nv(0) = 0 => -0.2 * (-0.6) + 0.3 * 1.96 * B + 2 * 0.3 = 0 => B = -0.15\n\nSo, the displacement equation of the system as a function of time is:\n\nx(t) = e^(-0.2/1 * t) * (-0.6 * cos(1.96t) - 0.15 * sin(1.96t)) + 0.6 * cos(2t) + 0.3 * sin(2t)"
