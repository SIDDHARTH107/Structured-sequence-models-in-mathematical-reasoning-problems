    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of X and Y, we need to solve the system of equations given by:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 1 (1)\nx + y = 2 (2)\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 2 - x (3)\n\nNow, substitute equation (3) into equation (1):\n\nx^2 + (2 - x)^2 = 1\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n\nx^2 + 4 - 4x + x^2 = 1\n2x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic equation for x:\n\n2x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nWe can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(2x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the possible values for x are:\n\nx = 1 and x = 3/2\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding values for y using equation (3):\n\nFor x = 1:\ny = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nFor x = 3/2:\ny = 2 - 3/2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the intersection points of X and Y are:\n\n(1, 1) and (3/2, 1/2)\n\nTherefore, there are 2 intersection points of X and Y, counted with multiplicities."
