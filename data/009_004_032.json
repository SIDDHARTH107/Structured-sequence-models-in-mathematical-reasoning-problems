    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a math student to solve on Vibrations and Oscillations in Mechanical Systems:\n\nA mass-spring system has a mass of 0.5 kg attached to a spring with spring constant 10 N/m. If the mass is displaced 2 cm from its equilibrium position and then released, find the position function of the mass as a function of time assuming no damping.\n\nThe student needs to solve for the position function x(t) using the differential equation of the mass-spring system and the initial conditions.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first write down the differential equation for the mass-spring system and then use the initial conditions to find the position function x(t).\n\nThe differential equation for a mass-spring system without damping is given by:\n\nm * x''(t) + k * x(t) = 0\n\nwhere m is the mass, k is the spring constant, and x(t) is the position function of the mass. In our case, m = 0.5 kg and k = 10 N/m.\n\n0.5 * x''(t) + 10 * x(t) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. We can guess a solution of the form x(t) = e^(rt), where r is a constant. Plugging this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n0.5 * r^2 * e^(rt) + 10 * e^(rt) = 0\n\nDividing by e^(rt), we get the characteristic equation:\n\n0.5 * r^2 + 10 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get two complex roots:\n\nr1, r2 = Â±(i * sqrt(20))\n\nThe general solution for x(t) is given by:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(sqrt(20) * t) + B * sin(sqrt(20) * t)\n\nNow, we need to use the initial conditions to find the constants A and B. The initial conditions are:\n\nx(0) = 0.02 m (2 cm displacement from equilibrium)\nx'(0) = 0 m/s (mass is released from rest)\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) = A\nA = 0.02 m\n\nTo find B, we need to differentiate x(t) with respect to time:\n\nx'(t) = -A * sqrt(20) * sin(sqrt(20) * t) + B * sqrt(20) * cos(sqrt(20) * t)\n\nApplying the second initial condition:\n\nx'(0) = -A * sqrt(20) * sin(0) + B * sqrt(20) * cos(0) = B * sqrt(20)\nB = 0 m/s\n\nSo, the position function x(t) is:\n\nx(t) = 0.02 * cos(sqrt(20) * t)"
