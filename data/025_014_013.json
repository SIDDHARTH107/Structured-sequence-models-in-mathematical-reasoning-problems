    "message_2": "To find the value of the theta function at the origin, we first need to understand the properties of the Riemann surface and the theta function associated with it.\n\nThe given equation $y^2 = x^3 - 3x$ defines an elliptic curve, which is a smooth projective curve of genus 1. The theta function associated with this Riemann surface is a holomorphic function that encodes information about the periods of the curve.\n\nThe theta function can be expressed in terms of the Jacobi theta functions as follows:\n\n$\\Theta(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(\\pi i n^2 \\tau + 2 \\pi i n z)$,\n\nwhere $\\tau$ is the period matrix of the Riemann surface, and $z$ is a complex variable.\n\nNow, we want to evaluate the theta function at the origin, i.e., at $z=0$. Plugging in $z=0$ into the expression for the theta function, we get:\n\n$\\Theta(0) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(\\pi i n^2 \\tau)$.\n\nThis sum converges absolutely and uniformly on compact subsets of the complex plane. Moreover, the theta function has the property that it is an even function, i.e., $\\Theta(-z) = \\Theta(z)$. Therefore, the sum can be simplified as follows:\n\n$\\Theta(0) = 1 + 2 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\exp(\\pi i n^2 \\tau)$.\n\nThe value of $\\Theta(0)$ depends on the period matrix $\\tau$ of the Riemann surface, which in turn depends on the specific elliptic curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 3x$. To find the numerical value of $\\Theta(0)$, one would need to compute the period matrix $\\tau$ for this elliptic curve and then evaluate the sum."
