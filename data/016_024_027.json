    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by removing the central square of a larger square and then repeating the process for the remaining smaller squares. After each iteration, the total area of the removed squares increases.\n\nThe area of the original square is given by the side length squared, which is 6 * 6 = 36 square centimeters.\n\nFor the Sierpinski carpet, after each iteration, the area of the removed squares is multiplied by a factor of 8/9. This is because, in each iteration, we remove 1/9 of the remaining area and keep 8/9 of it.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the remaining area of the Sierpinski carpet can be calculated as follows:\n\nRemaining area = Original area * (8/9)^4\n\nRemaining area = 36 * (8/9)^4\n\nRemaining area ≈ 36 * 0.5133\n\nRemaining area ≈ 18.4788 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the Sierpinski carpet after 4 iterations is approximately 18.4788 square centimeters."
