    "message_1": "Consider the surface of a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Let the metric be given by $ds^2 = 25(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta) d\\phi^2)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. Find all the isometries of this metric.",
    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points on the surface. In the case of the sphere, the isometries are the rotations and reflections that preserve the metric. We can express these isometries as elements of the orthogonal group O(3), which consists of 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant +1 (rotations) or -1 (reflections).\n\n1. Rotations about the z-axis: These rotations preserve the polar angle $\\theta$ and change the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ by a constant value $\\alpha$. The transformation can be written as:\n\n   $\\theta' = \\theta$\n   \n   $\\phi' = \\phi + \\alpha$\n\n2. Rotations about the x-axis or y-axis: These rotations change both the polar angle $\\theta$ and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$. The transformation can be written as:\n\n   $\\theta' = \\arccos(\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\beta) \\pm \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\beta)\\cos(\\phi))$\n   \n   $\\phi' = \\arctan(\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)}{\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\beta) \\pm \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\beta)\\cos(\\phi)})$\n\n   where $\\beta$ is the angle of rotation.\n\n3. Reflections: These transformations can be represented by reflections through planes that pass through the origin. There are three types of reflections:\n\n   a) Reflection through the xy-plane:\n   \n      $\\theta' = \\pi - \\theta$\n      \n      $\\phi' = \\phi$\n\n   b) Reflection through the yz-plane:\n   \n      $\\theta' = \\arccos(-\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi))$\n      \n      $\\phi' = \\arctan(\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{-\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)})$\n\n   c) Reflection through the zx-plane:\n   \n      $\\theta' = \\arccos(\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi))$\n      \n      $\\phi' = \\arctan(\\frac{-\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)})$\n\nThese transformations represent all the isometries of the given metric on the sphere of radius 5."
