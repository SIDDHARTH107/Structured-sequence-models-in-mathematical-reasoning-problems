    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x in the interval [-1, 2], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 2x^2 + x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -4, and c = 1:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(3)(1))) / (2(3))\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 12)) / 6\nx = (4 ± √4) / 6\nx = (4 ± 2) / 6\n\nThere are two possible values for x:\n\nx = (4 + 2) / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1\nx = (4 - 2) / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3\n\nNow we need to evaluate the function f(x) at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval [-1, 2]:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 + (-1) = -1 - 2 - 1 = -4\nf(1/3) = (1/3)^3 - 2(1/3)^2 + (1/3) ≈ -0.1852\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 2(1)^2 + (1) = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 2(2)^2 + (2) = 8 - 8 + 2 = 2\n\nComparing the values of f(x) at these points, we find that the maximum value of the function in the interval [-1, 2] is f(2) = 2."
