    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges in a graph such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges in the set share a vertex.\n\nIn the given graph G, we can observe that it has 8 vertices. To have a perfect matching, we need to have 4 disjoint edges that cover all the vertices.\n\nLet's try to find a perfect matching in the given graph G:\n\n1. We can start by selecting edge (A, B). Now, vertices A and B are covered.\n2. Next, we can select edge (C, D). Now, vertices C and D are covered.\n3. Now, we can select edge (E, F). Now, vertices E and F are covered.\n4. Finally, we can select edge (G, H). Now, vertices G and H are covered.\n\nSo, we have a perfect matching in the graph G, which consists of the edges (A, B), (C, D), (E, F), and (G, H)."
