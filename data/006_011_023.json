    "message_1": "What is the probability that in a workplace with 50 employees, at least one accident of a certain type will occur in a year if the probability of any one employee having the accident in a year is 0.03?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least one accident occurring, we will find the probability of no accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of an employee not having an accident in a year is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nFor all 50 employees to not have an accident, we multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.97^50 ≈ 0.216\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring:\n\n1 - 0.216 ≈ 0.784\n\nSo, the probability of at least one accident occurring in a year is approximately 0.784 or 78.4%."
