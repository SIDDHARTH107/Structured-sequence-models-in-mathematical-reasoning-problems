    "message_2": "To prove this statement, we will use the properties of natural numbers and the Peano axioms, which are a set of axioms for the natural numbers. The Peano axioms are:\n\n1. 0 is a natural number.\n2. For every natural number x, x = x.\n3. For all natural numbers x and y, if x = y, then y = x.\n4. For all natural numbers x, y, and z, if x = y and y = z, then x = z.\n5. For all natural numbers x and y, if x = y, then x+1 = y+1.\n6. For all natural numbers x, x+1 ≠ 0.\n7. For all properties P(x), if P(0) is true and for every natural number x, P(x) implies P(x+1), then for every natural number x, P(x) is true.\n\nNow, let's prove the statement:\n\nFor every natural number n, there exists another natural number m such that m is greater than n.\n\nProof:\n\nLet P(n) be the property \"there exists a natural number m such that m > n.\"\n\nBase case: P(0)\n\nWe need to show that there exists a natural number m such that m > 0. By the Peano axioms, 0 is a natural number, and 0+1 = 1 is also a natural number. Since 1 > 0, we have found a natural number m (in this case, m = 1) such that m > 0. Therefore, P(0) is true.\n\nInductive step: P(n) → P(n+1)\n\nAssume P(n) is true, which means there exists a natural number m such that m > n. We need to show that there exists a natural number m' such that m' > n+1.\n\nSince m > n, we can add 1 to both sides of the inequality to get m+1 > n+1. By the Peano axioms, m+1 is also a natural number. Let m' = m+1. Then, we have m' > n+1.\n\nThus, P(n+1) is true.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction (Peano axiom 7), for every natural number n, there exists another natural number m such that m is greater than n."
