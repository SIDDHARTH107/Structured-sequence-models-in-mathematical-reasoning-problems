    "message_2": "To determine the differential equation governing the circuit, we need to apply Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) which states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop is equal to zero. In a series RLC circuit, the voltage across the resistor (V_R), inductor (V_L), and capacitor (V_C) must sum to the applied voltage (V(t)).\n\nV(t) = V_R + V_L + V_C\n\nThe voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law: V_R = iR, where i is the current through the resistor and R is the resistance.\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is given by V_L = L(di/dt), where L is the inductance and di/dt is the rate of change of current with respect to time.\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is given by V_C = 1/C ∫i dt, where C is the capacitance and ∫i dt is the integral of the current with respect to time.\n\nNow we can write the KVL equation:\n\nV(t) = iR + L(di/dt) + 1/C ∫i dt\n\nThe applied voltage V(t) is an alternating voltage with a maximum value of 100 volts and a half-period of 0.01 seconds. This means the frequency of the voltage is f = 1/(2 * 0.01) = 50 Hz, and the angular frequency is ω = 2πf = 100π rad/s. The applied voltage can be written as:\n\nV(t) = 100sin(100πt)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the KVL equation as:\n\n100sin(100πt) = 10i + 2(di/dt) + 1/(10 * 10^(-6)) ∫i dt\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to find the current i(t) and then differentiate it to find the voltage across the capacitor. To do this, we can use Laplace transforms. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n100s/(s^2 + 10000π^2) = 10I(s) + 2sI(s) - 2i(0) + 1/(10 * 10^(-6)) * 1/s * I(s)\n\nAssuming the initial current i(0) = 0, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n100s/(s^2 + 10000π^2) = (10 + 2s + 1/(10 * 10^(-6)) * 1/s) * I(s)\n\nNow, we can solve for I(s):\n\nI(s) = 100s / [(s^2 + 10000π^2)(10 + 2s + 1/(10 * 10^(-6)) * 1/s)]\n\nTo find the voltage across the capacitor, we need to find V_C(s) = 1/(10 * 10^(-6)) * 1/s * I(s). Multiplying I(s) by 1/(10 * 10^(-6)) * 1/s, we get:\n\nV_C(s) = 10000/(s^2 + 10000π^2)(10 + 2s + 1/(10 * 10^(-6)) * 1/s)\n\nNow, we can take the inverse Laplace transform of V_C(s) to find V_C(t). This is a complex process involving partial fraction decomposition and inverse Laplace transforms of each term. After performing these steps, we get:\n\nV_C(t) = A * sin(100πt) + B * cos(100πt) + C * e^(-αt) * sin(βt) + D * e^(-αt) * cos(βt)\n\nwhere A, B, C, and D are constants that depend on the initial conditions of the circuit, and α and β are constants related to the damping and resonant frequency of the circuit.\n\nTo find the exact values of A, B, C, and D, we would need more information about the initial conditions of the circuit. However, this general equation gives us the voltage across the capacitor at any given time for a series RLC circuit with the given component values and applied voltage."
