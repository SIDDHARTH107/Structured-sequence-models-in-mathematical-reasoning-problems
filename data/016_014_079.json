    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve can be found using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1 / r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, the number of self-similar pieces (N) is 2, and the scaling factor (r) is 1 / sqrt(2), as each transformation replaces the original segment with two segments, each of length 1 / sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) can be calculated as:\n\nD = log(2) / log(1 / (1 / sqrt(2)))\nD = log(2) / log(sqrt(2))\nD ≈ 2 / log(2) ≈ 1.523\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 1.523."
