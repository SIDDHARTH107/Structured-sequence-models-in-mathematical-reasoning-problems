    "message_2": "First, we need to find out how many students own a laptop. \n\n70% of 200 students own a laptop:\n(70/100) * 200 = 140 students\n\nNow, we need to find out how many students do not own a laptop:\n200 students (total) - 140 students (with laptop) = 60 students (without laptop)\n\nTo find the probability that a random student selected from this school does not own a laptop, we need to divide the number of students without a laptop by the total number of students:\n\nProbability = (Number of students without a laptop) / (Total number of students)\nProbability = 60 / 200\nProbability = 0.3 or 30%\n\nSo, the probability that a random student selected from this school does not own a laptop is 30%."
