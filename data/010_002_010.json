    "message_2": "In this case, the concept of continuity does not apply since X and Y are discrete sets (not intervals of real numbers). Continuity is a property of functions defined on intervals of real numbers or other topological spaces.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for the number of possible functions from X to Y, you can find it by considering that each element in X can be mapped to any element in Y. \n\nThere are 4 choices for f(1) (it can be a, b, c, or d), 4 choices for f(2), and 4 choices for f(3). So, the total number of possible functions from X to Y is:\n\n4 * 4 * 4 = 64"
