    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it maps a continuous curve onto a unit square. The length of the Peano curve increases with each iteration of the construction algorithm. \n\nFor the first iteration, the curve has a length of 3 times the side length of the square. With each subsequent iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by 3. So after 4 iterations, the length of the Peano curve is:\n\nLength = (initial side length) * (3^4)\nLength = 1 * (3^4)\nLength = 1 * 81\nLength = 81\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve after applying the construction algorithm 4 times on a unit square is 81."
