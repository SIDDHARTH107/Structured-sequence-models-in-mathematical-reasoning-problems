    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x - 5 ≤ 7x + 23, we'll first isolate x by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality:\n-5 ≤ 4x + 23\n\n2. Subtract 23 from both sides of the inequality:\n-28 ≤ 4x\n\n3. Divide both sides by 4:\n-7 ≤ x\n\nNow we have the inequality -7 ≤ x, which can also be written as x ≥ -7.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line with -7 marked on it.\n2. Since the inequality is greater than or equal to -7, we'll use a closed circle at -7 to indicate that -7 is included in the solution.\n3. Shade the number line to the right of -7, indicating that all numbers greater than or equal to -7 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph of the solution will look like this:\n\n```\n<---(---(-7)---)--->\n```\n\nThe closed circle at -7 and the shaded region to the right of it represent the solution x ≥ -7."
