    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the control system, we need to replace s with jω, where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency. The frequency response is given by:\n\nG(jω) = 10 / (jω)^2 + 5(jω) + 6\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum frequency. The maximum frequency occurs when the phase shift is -90 degrees. To find the phase shift, we can look at the denominator of the transfer function:\n\n(jω)^2 + 5(jω) + 6\n\nLet's set the real and imaginary parts equal to zero:\n\nReal part: ω^2 - 6 = 0\nImaginary part: 5ω = 0\n\nSolving the real part equation, we get:\n\nω^2 = 6\nω = √6\n\nSince we want half the maximum frequency, we have:\n\nω_half = (1/2) * √6\n\nNow, we can find the frequency response at half the maximum frequency by plugging ω_half into the transfer function:\n\nG(jω_half) = 10 / ((j(1/2)√6)^2 + 5(j(1/2)√6) + 6)\n\nG(jω_half) = 10 / ((-3/4 * 6) + 5(j(1/2)√6) + 6)\n\nG(jω_half) = 10 / (-9/2 + 5(j(1/2)√6) + 6)\n\nG(jω_half) = 10 / (-1/2 + 5(j(1/2)√6))\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response:\n\nMagnitude = |G(jω_half)| = 10 / √((-1/2)^2 + (5(1/2)√6)^2)\nPhase = arctan(Imaginary part / Real part) = arctan((5(1/2)√6) / (-1/2))\n\nCalculate the values:\n\nMagnitude ≈ 10 / √(0.25 + 75)\nMagnitude ≈ 10 / √75.25\nMagnitude ≈ 10 / 8.67\nMagnitude ≈ 1.15\n\nPhase ≈ arctan(-5√6)\nPhase ≈ -80.9 degrees\n\nSo, the frequency response of the control system at half the maximum frequency is approximately 1.15 with a phase shift of -80.9 degrees."
