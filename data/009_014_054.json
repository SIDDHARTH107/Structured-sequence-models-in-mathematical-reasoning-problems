    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of rabbits the forest can sustain in the long term, we need to find the carrying capacity of the forest. The carrying capacity is the value of y when the population growth rate (dy/dt) is zero. \n\n0 = 0.3y(1 - y/500)\n\nWe can solve this equation for y:\n\n0 = y(1 - y/500)\n\nThere are two possible solutions: y = 0 and y = 500. Since y = 0 represents no rabbits, the carrying capacity of the forest is y = 500 rabbits.\n\nNow, we need to find how long it takes for the population to reach 90% of this maximum. 90% of the carrying capacity is 0.9 * 500 = 450 rabbits. \n\nTo find the time it takes to reach this population, we need to solve the differential equation:\n\ndy/dt = 0.3y(1 - y/500)\n\nWe can rewrite this as a separable equation:\n\ndy/y(1 - y/500) = 0.3 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y(1 - y/500)) dy = ∫0.3 dt\n\nUsing partial fraction decomposition, we can rewrite the left side as:\n\n(1/500) ∫(1/(1 - y/500) - 1/y) dy = ∫0.3 dt\n\nNow, integrate:\n\n(-500 ln|1 - y/500| + 500 ln|y|) = 0.3t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition y(0) = 200:\n\n-500 ln(1 - 200/500) + 500 ln(200) = C\n\nC ≈ 277.26\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\n-500 ln|1 - y/500| + 500 ln|y| = 0.3t + 277.26\n\nWe want to find the time t when y = 450:\n\n-500 ln(1 - 450/500) + 500 ln(450) = 0.3t + 277.26\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt ≈ 14.47 months\n\nSo, it takes approximately 14.47 months for the population to reach 90% of the carrying capacity, which is 450 rabbits."
