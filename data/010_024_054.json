    "message_1": "A math student is asked to find the area of a hyperbolic triangle whose angles measure 40°, 60°, and 80°, all in hyperbolic space. If the hyperbolic plane has a curvature of -1, what is the area of this hyperbolic triangle?",
    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a hyperbolic triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle with angles α, β, and γ in a hyperbolic plane with curvature K is:\n\nArea = (π - (α + β + γ)) / |K|\n\nIn this case, the angles are 40°, 60°, and 80°, and the curvature K is -1. First, we need to convert the angles to radians:\n\n40° = 40 * (π/180) = 2π/9 radians\n60° = 60 * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n80° = 80 * (π/180) = 4π/9 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (π - (2π/9 + π/3 + 4π/9)) / |-1|\n\nArea = (π - (2π/9 + 3π/9 + 4π/9)) / 1\n\nArea = (π - 9π/9) = π - π = 0\n\nThe area of this hyperbolic triangle is 0."
