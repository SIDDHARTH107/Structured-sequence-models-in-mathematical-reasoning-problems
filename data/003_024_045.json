    "message_2": "To find the projection of the 20 N force onto the 10 N force, we need to find the component of the 20 N force that is acting in the East direction.\n\nSince the 20 N force is acting towards the North-East direction, it makes an angle of 45 degrees with the East direction. We can use the cosine function to find the projection of the 20 N force onto the East direction.\n\nProjection = Magnitude of the force × cos(angle)\n\nProjection = 20 N × cos(45°)\n\nSince cos(45°) = √2/2,\n\nProjection = 20 N × (√2/2)\n\nProjection = 10√2 N\n\nSo, the projection of the 20 N force onto the 10 N force is 10√2 N."
