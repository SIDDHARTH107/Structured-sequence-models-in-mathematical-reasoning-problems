    "message_1": "A population grows at an annual rate of 5%, and the initial population is 1000. Write a differential equation that represents the population growth, and use it to find the population after 10 years.",
    "message_2": "To write a differential equation that represents the population growth, we can use the exponential growth model. The general form of the exponential growth model is:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, and k is the growth rate.\n\nIn this case, the annual growth rate is 5%, which can be written as k = 0.05. So, our differential equation becomes:\n\ndP/dt = 0.05P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We'll rewrite the equation as:\n\ndP/P = 0.05 dt\n\nNow, we'll integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.05 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.05t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we'll use the initial condition that the population is 1000 when t = 0:\n\nln(1000) = 0.05(0) + C\nC = ln(1000)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = 0.05t + ln(1000)\n\nTo find the population after 10 years, we'll plug in t = 10:\n\nln(P) = 0.05(10) + ln(1000)\n\nNow, we'll solve for P:\n\nP = e^(0.05(10) + ln(1000))\nP = e^(0.5 + ln(1000))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP ≈ 1628.96\n\nSo, the population after 10 years is approximately 1629 people."
