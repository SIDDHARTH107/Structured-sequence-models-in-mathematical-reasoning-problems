    "message_2": "To classify groups of order 48 up to isomorphism, we will use the Sylow theorems and consider the possible Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. \n\nLet G be a group of order 48. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16.\n\nWe will now consider the possible cases for the Sylow subgroups and their normality.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, both the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Then G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Since P has order 16 and Q has order 3, we have G ≅ P × C_3, where C_3 is the cyclic group of order 3. There are 5 groups of order 16 (up to isomorphism): C_16, C_8 × C_2, C_4 × C_4, C_4 × C_2 × C_2, and D_8 (the dihedral group of order 16). Thus, in this case, we have 5 non-isomorphic groups.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 > 1\nIn this case, the 2-Sylow subgroup P is normal, but the 3-Sylow subgroups are not. We can use the semidirect product to combine P with a 3-Sylow subgroup Q. Since P has order 16 and Q has order 3, we have G ≅ P ⋊ Q. There are 5 groups of order 16 (as mentioned before), and for each of them, we need to consider the possible actions of Q on P. After analyzing the possible actions, we find that there are 5 additional non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 > 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, the 3-Sylow subgroup Q is normal, but the 2-Sylow subgroups are not. We can use the semidirect product to combine Q with a 2-Sylow subgroup P. Since P has order 16 and Q has order 3, we have G ≅ P ⋊ Q. After analyzing the possible actions of P on Q, we find that there are 3 additional non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 > 1 and n_3 > 1\nIn this case, neither the 2-Sylow nor the 3-Sylow subgroups are normal. However, we can still use the semidirect product to combine a 2-Sylow subgroup P with a 3-Sylow subgroup Q. After analyzing the possible actions of P and Q on each other, we find that there are 2 additional non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nIn total, we have found 5 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
