    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos^2(x) - 3sin(x) = 1, we can use the identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. \n\nFirst, we rewrite the equation in terms of sin(x):\n\n1 - sin^2(x) - 3sin(x) = 1\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in sin(x):\n\n-sin^2(x) - 3sin(x) = 0\n\nTo make it easier to solve, we can multiply the equation by -1:\n\nsin^2(x) + 3sin(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the equation:\n\nsin(x)(sin(x) + 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\n1) sin(x) = 0\n2) sin(x) + 3 = 0, which means sin(x) = -3\n\nHowever, since the sine function has a range of -1 to 1, sin(x) = -3 has no solution. So, we only need to consider sin(x) = 0.\n\nFor x between 0 and 2π, sin(x) = 0 at x = 0 and x = π.\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = 0 and x = π."
