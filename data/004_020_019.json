    "message_1": "A 50 Newton force is applied to lift a box 4 meters vertically. How much work is done in lifting the box? Use integration to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done in lifting the box, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nwhere Force is the force applied, Distance is the distance over which the force is applied, and θ is the angle between the force and the direction of motion. In this case, the force is applied vertically and the box is lifted vertically, so the angle θ is 0 degrees, and cos(0) = 1.\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the work done:\n\nWork = ∫(Force × Distance) dDistance\n\nSince the force is constant (50 N), we can take it out of the integral:\n\nWork = Force × ∫(Distance) dDistance\n\nNow, we integrate the distance from 0 to 4 meters:\n\nWork = 50 N × ∫(Distance) dDistance from 0 to 4\n\nWork = 50 N × [1/2 × Distance^2] from 0 to 4\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = 50 N × (1/2 × (4^2) - 1/2 × (0^2))\n\nWork = 50 N × (1/2 × 16)\n\nWork = 50 N × 8\n\nWork = 400 J (Joules)\n\nSo, the work done in lifting the box is 400 Joules."
