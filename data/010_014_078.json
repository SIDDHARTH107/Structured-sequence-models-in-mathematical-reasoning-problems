    "message_1": "Consider a topological space X, and let H^2(X) denote its second cohomology group. Suppose that H^2(X) is a cyclic group of order 6. How many non-homeomorphic spaces are there up to homeomorphism such that their second cohomology group is isomorphic to H^2(X)?",
    "message_2": "It is not possible to determine the exact number of non-homeomorphic spaces with a given cohomology group without more information about the spaces. The cohomology group is just one algebraic invariant of a topological space, and there can be many different spaces with the same cohomology groups but different topological properties.\n\nFor example, consider the case when the second cohomology group H^2(X) is isomorphic to Z/6Z, the cyclic group of order 6. There are many different topological spaces with this cohomology group, such as certain lens spaces, some projective spaces, and other more exotic examples. However, without more information about the spaces in question, it is impossible to determine the exact number of non-homeomorphic spaces with this cohomology group.\n\nIn general, determining whether two spaces are homeomorphic is a difficult problem, and there is no simple algorithm for doing so. Instead, one must rely on a combination of algebraic invariants, such as cohomology groups, and geometric properties, such as the fundamental group or the homotopy type of the space."
