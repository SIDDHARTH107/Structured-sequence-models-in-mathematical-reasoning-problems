A tree decomposition is a collection of subsets of vertices of the graph that satisfy certain conditions. The treewidth of the graph is then one less than the maximum size of these subsets minus one.",
    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition with the minimum width. The graph can be decomposed into the following tree decomposition:\n\n```\nBag 1: {1, 2, 5, 6}\nBag 2: {2, 3, 6, 7}\nBag 3: {3, 4, 7, 8}\n```\n\nThis tree decomposition satisfies the required conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags contains all vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge in the graph, there is a bag containing both vertices of the edge.\n3. For each vertex, the bags containing that vertex form a connected subtree.\n\nThe maximum size of these subsets is 4. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph is the maximum size of the subsets minus one, which is 4 - 1 = 3."
