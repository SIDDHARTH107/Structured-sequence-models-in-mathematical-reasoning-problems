    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is constructed by replacing each segment of the curve with a specific pattern of segments at each iteration. The length of the curve increases by a factor of (√7) with each iteration.\n\nAfter 3 iterations, the length of the Gosper curve will be:\n\nInitial length × (√7)^3\n1 × (√7)^3\n1 × (7√7)\n7√7\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 3 iterations is 7√7 units."
