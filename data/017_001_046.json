The Klein four-group, denoted as V or Z2 x Z2.\n\nThe cyclic group of order 4, C4, is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 4, which is {0, 1, 2, 3} with addition modulo 4 as the operation. It has one element of order 4 (1) and three elements of order 2 (0, 2, and 3).\n\nThe Klein four-group, V, is isomorphic to the direct product of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2, Z2 x Z2. It consists of four elements: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), with component-wise addition modulo 2 as the operation. All non-identity elements in this group have order 2."
