    "message_2": "In a Rail Fence cipher with 3 levels, the message is written in a zigzag pattern along three horizontal lines. Let's write the message \"MATHEMATICS\" in this pattern:\n\nM   E   I\n A H A T C\n  T   M   S\n\nNow, read the message along the lines from left to right and top to bottom:\n\nMEIAHTCTMS\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"MEIAHTCTMS\"."
