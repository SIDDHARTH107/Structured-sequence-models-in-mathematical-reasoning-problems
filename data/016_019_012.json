    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by iteratively applying the Koch curve construction to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side is multiplied by 4/3. \n\nLet's denote the initial perimeter as P0, and the perimeter after n iterations as Pn. The perimeter after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPn = P0 * (4/3)^n\n\nGiven that the initial equilateral triangle has a perimeter of 12 units (P0 = 12), we can find the total length of the Koch snowflake after 5 iterations (P5) using the formula:\n\nP5 = 12 * (4/3)^5\n\nP5 ≈ 12 * 1024/243 ≈ 50.960\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Koch snowflake after 5 iterations is approximately 50.960 units."
