    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [2-λ 4; 1 3-λ]\n\nNow, we need to find the determinant of (A - λI):\n\ndet(A - λI) = (2-λ)(3-λ) - (4)(1) = λ^2 - 5λ + 2\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ + 2 = 0\n\nBy factoring, we get:\n\n(λ - 2)(λ - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([0 4; 1 1] - [2 0; 0 2])v1 = 0\n([-2 4; 1 -1])v1 = 0\n\nSolving the system of linear equations, we get:\n\n-2x1 + 4x2 = 0\nx1 - x2 = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we have x1 = x2. Let x2 = 1, then x1 = 1. So, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 = 2 is:\n\nv1 = [1; 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 3:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([2 4; 1 3] - [3 0; 0 3])v2 = 0\n([-1 4; 1 0])v2 = 0\n\nSolving the system of linear equations, we get:\n\n-x1 + 4x2 = 0\nx1 = 0\n\nLet x1 = 1, then x2 = 1/4. So, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 = 3 is:\n\nv2 = [1; 1/4]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 3, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [1; 1] and v2 = [1; 1/4]."
