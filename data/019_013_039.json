    "message_2": "The statement \"Every natural number in S is greater than 5\" is false in second-order logic.\n\nTo see why, let's first define S as the set of all even natural numbers:\n\nS = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}\n\nNow, let's examine the statement \"Every natural number in S is greater than 5.\" We can see that there are even natural numbers in S that are not greater than 5, specifically 2 and 4. Therefore, the statement is false."
