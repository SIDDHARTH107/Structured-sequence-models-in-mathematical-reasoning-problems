    "message_2": "To determine the type of singularity at the point (0,0), we will first compute the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy.\n\nThe partial derivative of f with respect to x is:\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y.\n\nThe partial derivative of f with respect to y is:\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x.\n\nNow, we will evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (0,0).\n\n∂f/∂x(0,0) = 3(0)^2 - 3(0) = 0.\n∂f/∂y(0,0) = 3(0)^2 - 3(0) = 0.\n\nSince both partial derivatives are zero at the point (0,0), we need to further investigate the nature of the singularity. We will compute the second-order partial derivatives.\n\nThe second-order partial derivatives are:\n∂²f/∂x² = 6x,\n∂²f/∂y² = 6y,\n∂²f/∂x∂y = -3.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the second-order partial derivatives at the point (0,0).\n\n∂²f/∂x²(0,0) = 6(0) = 0.\n∂²f/∂y²(0,0) = 6(0) = 0.\n∂²f/∂x∂y(0,0) = -3.\n\nSince both ∂²f/∂x² and ∂²f/∂y² are zero at the point (0,0), we cannot use the standard classification of critical points. However, we can still analyze the equation f(x, y) = 0.\n\nNotice that we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx^3 + y^3 = 3xy.\n\nNow, divide both sides by x^3 (assuming x ≠ 0):\n\n1 + (y/x)^3 = 3(y/x).\n\nLet t = y/x, then:\n\n1 + t^3 = 3t.\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nt^3 - 3t + 1 = 0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in t. Notice that t = 1 is a root of this equation:\n\n(1)^3 - 3(1) + 1 = 0.\n\nNow, we can factor the cubic equation:\n\n(t - 1)(t^2 + t - 1) = 0.\n\nThe equation has one real root t = 1 and two other complex roots. Since there is only one real root, the curve has a unique tangent at the point (0,0). Therefore, the singularity at the point (0,0) is a cusp."
