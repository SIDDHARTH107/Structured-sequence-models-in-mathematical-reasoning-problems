    "message_2": "To find the poles of the meromorphic function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero. The denominator is given by:\n\nD(z) = (z^2 + 1)(z-1)^3\n\nThe poles occur when D(z) = 0. We can see that the factors (z^2 + 1) and (z-1) are responsible for the poles. \n\n1. For the factor (z^2 + 1), we have:\nz^2 + 1 = 0\nz^2 = -1\nz = Â±i\n\nSo, we have two poles at z = i and z = -i. Both of these poles are simple poles since the power of the factor (z^2 + 1) is 1.\n\n2. For the factor (z-1), we have:\n(z-1)^3 = 0\nz = 1\n\nWe have one pole at z = 1, but it is a triple pole since the power of the factor (z-1) is 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the residues for each pole.\n\nResidue at z = i:\nSince it is a simple pole, we can use the formula:\nRes(z) = lim (z->i) [(z - i) * f(z)]\n\nRes(i) = lim (z->i) [(z - i) * (z^4 - 2z^2 + 2) / [(z^2 + 1)(z-1)^3]]\nUsing L'Hopital's rule or calculating the limit directly, we get:\nRes(i) = -2i/(-8i)\n\nRes(i) = 1/4\n\nResidue at z = -i:\nSimilarly,\nRes(-i) = 1/4\n\nResidue at z = 1:\nSince it is a triple pole, we need to find the second derivative of the function with respect to z and evaluate it at z = 1. Let g(z) = z^4 - 2z^2 + 2. Then:\n\nf(z) = g(z) / (z-1)^3\n\nTaking the second derivative of g(z) with respect to z:\n\ng''(z) = 12z^2 - 4\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the residue of a triple pole:\n\nRes(z) = (1/2) * lim (z->1) [(z - 1)^2 * g''(z)]\n\nRes(1) = (1/2) * lim (z->1) [(z - 1)^2 * (12z^2 - 4)]\nRes(1) = (1/2) * (12 - 4)\nRes(1) = 4\n\nSo, the residues are:\nRes(i) = 1/4 (simple pole)\nRes(-i) = 1/4 (simple pole)\nRes(1) = 4 (triple pole)"
