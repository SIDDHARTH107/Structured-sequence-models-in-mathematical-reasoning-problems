    "message_2": "To find the transition function between the two charts, we need to express the coordinates (u, v) in terms of (x, y) and vice versa. Let's denote the transition functions as follows:\n\nφ(u, v) = (cos(u), sin(u), v) and ψ(x, y) = (cos(y), sin(y), x)\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse functions for φ and ψ. Let's denote them as φ^(-1) and ψ^(-1).\n\nφ^(-1)(cos(u), sin(u), v) = (u, v) and ψ^(-1)(cos(y), sin(y), x) = (x, y)\n\nNow, let's find the transition function from φ to ψ, which we can denote as T1:\n\nT1(u, v) = ψ^(-1)(φ(u, v)) = ψ^(-1)(cos(u), sin(u), v)\n\nTo find T1, we need to express x and y in terms of u and v. From the definition of ψ, we have:\n\ncos(y) = cos(u) and sin(y) = sin(u)\n\nSince cos^2(y) + sin^2(y) = 1, we have:\n\ncos^2(u) + sin^2(u) = 1\n\nThis implies that u = y (mod 2π) since both sine and cosine functions are periodic with period 2π. Therefore, we can write:\n\nx = v (mod 1) and y = u (mod 2π)\n\nNow, we can write T1 as:\n\nT1(u, v) = (v (mod 1), u (mod 2π))\n\nSimilarly, let's find the transition function from ψ to φ, which we can denote as T2:\n\nT2(x, y) = φ^(-1)(ψ(x, y)) = φ^(-1)(cos(y), sin(y), x)\n\nUsing the same reasoning as before, we have:\n\nv = x (mod 1) and u = y (mod 2π)\n\nSo, we can write T2 as:\n\nT2(x, y) = (y (mod 2π), x (mod 1))\n\nThus, the transition functions between the two charts are:\n\nT1(u, v) = (v (mod 1), u (mod 2π)) and T2(x, y) = (y (mod 2π), x (mod 1))"
