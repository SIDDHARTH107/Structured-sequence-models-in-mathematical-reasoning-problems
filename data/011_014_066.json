    "message_2": "A cycle is a closed path in a graph where no edge is repeated. To find the maximum number of cycles in a graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the concept of complete graphs.\n\nA complete graph is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. The number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = n(n-1)/2\n\nLet's find the maximum number of vertices that can form a complete graph with 10 edges:\n\nn(n-1)/2 = 10\nn(n-1) = 20\nn^2 - n - 20 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for n: n = 5 and n = -4. Since the number of vertices cannot be negative, we take n = 5.\n\nSo, the maximum number of vertices that can form a complete graph with 10 edges is 5. This complete graph is called K5, and it has the maximum number of cycles for a graph with 10 edges.\n\nNow, let's find the number of cycles in K5. A cycle can have a minimum of 3 vertices. So, we can have cycles of length 3, 4, and 5 in K5.\n\n1. Cycles of length 3 (triangles): There are 5 vertices in K5, and we need to choose 3 of them to form a triangle. This can be done in C(5,3) ways, where C(n,r) is the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time. C(5,3) = 5!/(3!2!) = 10.\n\n2. Cycles of length 4 (quadrilaterals): To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 vertices out of 5. This can be done in C(5,4) ways. C(5,4) = 5!/(4!1!) = 5.\n\nHowever, each quadrilateral has 2 diagonals, and these diagonals also form a cycle of length 3 (triangle). Since we have already counted these triangles in the previous step, we need to subtract them from the total count of quadrilaterals. There are 2 triangles in each quadrilateral, so we subtract 2*5 = 10 triangles. Therefore, the number of unique cycles of length 4 is 5 - 10 = -5. Since the number of cycles cannot be negative, there are 0 unique cycles of length 4.\n\n3. Cycles of length 5: There is only one cycle of length 5 in K5, which includes all 5 vertices.\n\nSo, the maximum number of cycles in a graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges is the sum of cycles of length 3, 4, and 5:\n\nTotal cycles = 10 (length 3) + 0 (length 4) + 1 (length 5) = 11."
