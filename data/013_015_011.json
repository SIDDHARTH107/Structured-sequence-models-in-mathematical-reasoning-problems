    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Game theory and Principal-Agent Problem:\n\nA principal owns a factory, and she wants to hire a manager to run the factory. The manager can choose between two effort levels: high effort or low effort. If the manager chooses high effort, the factory earns a profit of $180,000. If the manager chooses low effort, the factory earns $120,000 in profit. The principal can offer the manager a compensation package that includes a salary and a bonus payment. If the manager chooses high effort, the principal pays him a salary of $60,000 and a bonus of $40,000. If the manager chooses low effort, the principal pays him a salary of $80,000 and no bonus. \n\nAssuming the manager is risk-neutral and values money equally regardless of the effort level he chooses, what compensation package should the principal offer to maximize her profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal compensation package, we need to analyze the manager's incentives and the principal's profit under each effort level.\n\n1. High effort level:\nManager's compensation: $60,000 (salary) + $40,000 (bonus) = $100,000\nPrincipal's profit: $180,000 (factory profit) - $100,000 (manager's compensation) = $80,000\n\n2. Low effort level:\nManager's compensation: $80,000 (salary) + $0 (bonus) = $80,000\nPrincipal's profit: $120,000 (factory profit) - $80,000 (manager's compensation) = $40,000\n\nSince the manager is risk-neutral and values money equally regardless of the effort level, he will choose the high effort level if his compensation is higher for high effort than for low effort. In this case, the manager's compensation for high effort ($100,000) is higher than for low effort ($80,000), so he will choose the high effort level.\n\nThe principal's profit is maximized when the manager chooses the high effort level, as her profit is $80,000 compared to $40,000 for the low effort level. Therefore, the principal should offer the manager a compensation package with a salary of $60,000 and a bonus of $40,000 to maximize her profit."
