    "message_2": "To prove that G is a cyclic group, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince G has order 7, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 7. Since 7 is a prime number, the order of any non-identity element in G must be either 1 or 7. If the order of an element is 1, then it is the identity element. \n\nNow, let's pick any non-identity element g in G. Since the order of g must be 7, the subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, must have 7 elements. The elements of ⟨g⟩ are {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^6}, where g^0 is the identity element. Since ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of G and has the same order as G, it must be the case that ⟨g⟩ = G.\n\nThus, every element in G can be expressed as a power of g, and G is a cyclic group."
