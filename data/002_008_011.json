    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π is approximately 3.14.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm and the height (h) is 15 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14 * (8^2) * 15\n\nFirst, we square the radius:\n\n8^2 = 64\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14 * 64 * 15\n\nNext, we multiply the numbers:\n\nVolume = 3.14 * 64 * 15 / 3\n\nDivide 15 by 3:\n\n15 / 3 = 5\n\nNow, we have:\n\nVolume = 3.14 * 64 * 5\n\nMultiply the numbers:\n\nVolume ≈ 1004.48 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of water in the container when filled to the brim is approximately 1004.48 cubic centimeters."
