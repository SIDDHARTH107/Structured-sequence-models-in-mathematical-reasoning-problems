    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9, we will use the Sylow Theorems and the properties of groups of order p^2 (where p is a prime number).\n\nSince the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), we can apply the Sylow Theorems. According to the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides the order of G. In this case, the only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup in G, which we will denote as P. Since P is unique, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIf G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C9, C3 x C3, or C1 x C1 x C1. However, since the order of G is 9, the only possibility is that G is isomorphic to C9, the cyclic group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIf G is non-abelian, then we know that there exists an element a in G such that a is not in P (the unique Sylow 3-subgroup). Since P is normal in G, we can form the set {aP} which is a set of left cosets of P in G. Note that the order of aP is 3, as there are 3 distinct left cosets of P in G (since the order of G is 9 and the order of P is 3).\n\nNow, consider the semi-direct product of P and aP, denoted as P ⋊ aP. This is a group of order 9, and since G is non-abelian, P ⋊ aP must also be non-abelian. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 (if G is abelian) or the non-abelian group of order 9 (if G is non-abelian)."
