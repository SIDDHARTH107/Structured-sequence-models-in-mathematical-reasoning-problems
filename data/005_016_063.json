    "message_1": "A marketing research company conducted a survey of 100 customers who bought either product A or product B. It was found that 70% of customers who bought product A are males, while only 40% of customers who bought product B are males. If a new customer buys a product and happens to be a male, what is the probability that the customer bought product A? Use discriminant analysis to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using discriminant analysis, we need to find the probability of a male customer buying product A given that the customer is male. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability.\n\nLet M be the event that a customer is male, A be the event that a customer buys product A, and B be the event that a customer buys product B.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(M|A) = 0.7 (70% of customers who bought product A are males)\nP(M|B) = 0.4 (40% of customers who bought product B are males)\n\nWe also need to know the probabilities of a customer buying product A or product B. Since we don't have this information, we can assume that the probabilities are equal:\n\nP(A) = P(B) = 0.5\n\nNow, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of a customer buying product A given that the customer is male:\n\nP(A|M) = P(M|A) * P(A) / [P(M|A) * P(A) + P(M|B) * P(B)]\n\nPlugging in the given probabilities:\n\nP(A|M) = (0.7 * 0.5) / [(0.7 * 0.5) + (0.4 * 0.5)]\n\nP(A|M) = 0.35 / (0.35 + 0.2)\n\nP(A|M) = 0.35 / 0.55\n\nP(A|M) â‰ˆ 0.636\n\nSo, the probability that a male customer bought product A is approximately 63.6%."
