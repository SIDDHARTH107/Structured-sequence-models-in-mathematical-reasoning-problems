    "message_2": "To find the points on the loop where the tangent vector is parallel to the vector (2, 4, 6), we first need to find the tangent vector of the loop. We can do this by taking the gradient of the given equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe equation of the loop is given by:\n\ne^(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = cos(t)\n\nLet's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ln(cos(t))\n\nNow, let's find the gradient of the left-hand side of the equation with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∇(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\nThe tangent vector of the loop is parallel to the vector (2, 4, 6) if there exists a scalar k such that:\n\n(2x, 2y, 2z) = k(2, 4, 6)\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n(x, y, z) = k(1, 2, 3)\n\nNow, we can substitute x, y, and z back into the equation of the loop:\n\nln(cos(t)) = (k(1))^2 + (k(2))^2 + (k(3))^2\nln(cos(t)) = k^2(1 + 4 + 9)\nln(cos(t)) = 14k^2\n\nSince 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π, we know that -1 ≤ cos(t) ≤ 1. Therefore, the range of ln(cos(t)) is:\n\n-ln(2) ≤ ln(cos(t)) ≤ 0\n\nNow, we can find the possible values of k:\n\n-ln(2) ≤ 14k^2 ≤ 0\n\nSolving for k, we get two possible values:\n\nk = 0 and k = ±√(-ln(2)/14)\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding points on the loop for each value of k:\n\nFor k = 0:\n(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nFor k = ±√(-ln(2)/14):\n(x, y, z) = ±√(-ln(2)/14)(1, 2, 3)\n\nSo, the points on the loop where the tangent vector is parallel to the vector (2, 4, 6) are:\n\n(0, 0, 0), √(-ln(2)/14)(1, 2, 3), and -√(-ln(2)/14)(1, 2, 3)"
