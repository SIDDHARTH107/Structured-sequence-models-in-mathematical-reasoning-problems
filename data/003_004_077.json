    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) + cos(x) = 0, we can use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So, the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) + cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out cos(x):\n\ncos(x)(2sin(x) + 1) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either of the factors is equal to zero. So, we have two separate cases to solve:\n\n1) cos(x) = 0\n2) 2sin(x) + 1 = 0\n\nFor case 1, cos(x) = 0:\n\nx = 90° and x = 270° (since cosine is zero at these angles within the given range of 0 to 360 degrees)\n\nFor case 2, 2sin(x) + 1 = 0:\n\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\nx = arcsin(-1/2)\n\nx ≈ -30° and x ≈ -150° (in the range of -180° to 180°)\n\nHowever, we need to find the solutions in the range of 0 to 360 degrees. To do this, we can add 360° to each of the negative angles:\n\nx ≈ 330° and x ≈ 210°\n\nSo, the solutions for x within the range of 0 to 360 degrees are:\n\nx = 90°, 270°, 330°, and 210°."
