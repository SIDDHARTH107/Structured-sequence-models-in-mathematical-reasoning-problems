    "message_2": "The given statement can be translated as: \"For all x such that x is less than or equal to n, if x is a prime number, then x is an odd number.\"\n\nTo determine if this statement is true or false, let's consider the properties of prime numbers and odd numbers.\n\nPrime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself. The smallest prime number is 2, and all other prime numbers are odd (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 11, ...).\n\nOdd numbers are numbers that cannot be divided evenly by 2, i.e., they have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statement. If x is a prime number and x ≤ n, then x must be either 2 or an odd number (since all prime numbers other than 2 are odd). Therefore, the statement is true for all prime numbers greater than 2.\n\nHowever, the statement is false when x = 2, as 2 is a prime number but not an odd number. So, the given statement is false for n ≥ 2. For n = 1, the statement is vacuously true since there are no prime numbers less than or equal to 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement is true for n = 1 and false for n ≥ 2."
