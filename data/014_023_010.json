    "message_2": "A rail fence cipher with two rails arranges the letters in a zigzag pattern, and the cipher text is read from left to right, top to bottom. For the plain text \"MATH\":\n\nM A\n T H\n\nThe corresponding cipher text is \"MATH\" since the letters remain in the same order when read from left to right, top to bottom."
