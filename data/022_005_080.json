    "message_2": "First, we need to find the poles of the function f(z) = (z^5 + 2z^3 + 3z) / (z^2 - 1). The poles are the zeros of the denominator, so we need to solve the equation z^2 - 1 = 0. This factors as (z - 1)(z + 1) = 0, so the poles are z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue of f(z) at each of its poles. We can do this by finding the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around each pole and then extracting the coefficient of the (z - pole)^(-1) term.\n\n1. Residue at z = 1:\nTo find the residue at z = 1, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 1] = lim_(z -> 1) [(z - 1) * f(z)]\n\n= lim_(z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (z^5 + 2z^3 + 3z) / (z^2 - 1)]\n\n= lim_(z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (z^5 + 2z^3 + 3z) / ((z - 1)(z + 1))]\n\n= lim_(z -> 1) [(z^5 + 2z^3 + 3z) / (z + 1)]\n\n= (1^5 + 2 * 1^3 + 3 * 1) / (1 + 1)\n\n= (1 + 2 + 3) / 2\n\n= 6 / 2\n\n= 3\n\n2. Residue at z = -1:\nTo find the residue at z = -1, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim_(z -> -1) [(z + 1) * f(z)]\n\n= lim_(z -> -1) [(z + 1) * (z^5 + 2z^3 + 3z) / (z^2 - 1)]\n\n= lim_(z -> -1) [(z + 1) * (z^5 + 2z^3 + 3z) / ((z - 1)(z + 1))]\n\n= lim_(z -> -1) [(z^5 + 2z^3 + 3z) / (z - 1)]\n\n= ((-1)^5 + 2 * (-1)^3 + 3 * (-1)) / (-1 - 1)\n\n= (-1 - 2 - 3) / (-2)\n\n= 6 / 2\n\n= 3\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral of f(z) over the circle |z| = 3. The residue theorem states that the integral of a function around a closed contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues at the poles inside the contour. In this case, both poles z = 1 and z = -1 are inside the circle |z| = 3, so we have:\n\n∮[f(z)]dz = 2πi * (Res[f(z), z = 1] + Res[f(z), z = -1])\n\n= 2πi * (3 + 3)\n\n= 2πi * 6\n\n= 12πi\n\nSo, the integral of f(z) over the circle |z| = 3 is equal to 12πi."
