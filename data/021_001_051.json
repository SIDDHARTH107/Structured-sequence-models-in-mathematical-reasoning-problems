    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations to transform the given system into an upper triangular matrix, and then solve for the variables using back-substitution.\n\n1. First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n   [3  2 -1 |  7]\n   [2 -4  6 | -2]\n   [1  1 -4 | -6]\n\n2. Next, we will eliminate the x terms below the first row. Divide the first row by 3 and subtract the appropriate multiple of the first row from the second and third rows:\n\n   [1  2/3 -1/3 |  7/3]\n   [0 -8/3  8/3 | -8/3]\n   [0  1/3 -11/3 | -8]\n\n3. Now, we will eliminate the y terms below the second row. Multiply the second row by -3/8 and add the appropriate multiple of the second row to the third row:\n\n   [1  2/3 -1/3 |  7/3]\n   [0  1   -1  |  1]\n   [0  0  -10 | -10]\n\n4. We now have an upper triangular matrix. Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n   z = -10 / -10 = 1\n   y = 1 - (-1)(1) = 2\n   x = (7/3) - (2/3)(2) + (1/3)(1) = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
