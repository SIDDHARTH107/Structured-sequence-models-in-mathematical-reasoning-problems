    "message_2": "To calculate the median of the dataset, we first need to arrange the values in ascending order, which is already done: {13, 15, 18, 21, 22}. Since there are 5 values in the dataset, the median is the middle value, which is the 3rd value in this case.\n\nMedian = 18\n\nNow, we will calculate the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). To do this, we first need to find the absolute deviations of each value from the median:\n\n|13 - 18| = 5\n|15 - 18| = 3\n|18 - 18| = 0\n|21 - 18| = 3\n|22 - 18| = 4\n\nThe absolute deviations are {5, 3, 0, 3, 4}. Now, we need to find the median of these absolute deviations. We arrange them in ascending order:\n\n{0, 3, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSince there are 5 values in this dataset, the median is the middle value, which is the 3rd value in this case.\n\nMAD = 3\n\nSo, the median of the dataset is 18, and the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is 3."
