In other words, an automorphism is a bijective function that maps the graph onto itself such that the edge set remains invariant.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the automorphism group by considering all possible permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation.\n\n1. Identity automorphism (no change):\n   A -> A, B -> B, C -> C, D -> D\n\n2. Swap A and B, and swap C and D:\n   A -> B, B -> A, C -> D, D -> C\n\n3. Swap A and C, and swap B and D:\n   A -> C, B -> D, C -> A, D -> B\n\n4. Swap A and D, and swap B and C:\n   A -> D, B -> C, C -> B, D -> A\n\n5. Swap A and B:\n   A -> B, B -> A, C -> C, D -> D\n\n6. Swap C and D:\n   A -> A, B -> B, C -> D, D -> C\n\n7. Swap A and C:\n   A -> C, B -> B, C -> A, D -> D\n\n8. Swap B and D:\n   A -> A, B -> D, C -> C, D -> B\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of the given graph that preserve the adjacency relation. Therefore, the automorphism group of the graph has 8 elements and can be represented as:\n\nAut(G) = {id, (AB)(CD), (AC)(BD), (AD)(BC), (AB), (CD), (AC), (BD)}"
