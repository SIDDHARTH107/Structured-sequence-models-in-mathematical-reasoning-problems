    "message_2": "Goldbach's Conjecture, proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742, states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. To this day, the conjecture has not been proven or disproven. Therefore, there is no known smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers according to Goldbach's Conjecture."
