    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 3x² + 2x + 1 from x = 1 to x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nFirst, let's find the integral of the function:\n\n∫(3x² + 2x + 1) dx = ∫(3x² dx) + ∫(2x dx) + ∫(1 dx)\n\nNow, we integrate each term:\n\n∫(3x² dx) = x³ + C₁\n∫(2x dx) = x² + C₂\n∫(1 dx) = x + C₃\n\nSo, the integral of the function is:\n\nx³ + x² + x + C (where C = C₁ + C₂ + C₃)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the given limits (x = 1 and x = 4):\n\nArea = [x³ + x² + x] (from x = 1 to x = 4)\n\nArea = (4³ + 4² + 4) - (1³ + 1² + 1)\n\nArea = (64 + 16 + 4) - (1 + 1 + 1)\n\nArea = 84 - 3\n\nArea = 81\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 3x² + 2x + 1 from x = 1 to x = 4 is 81 square units."
