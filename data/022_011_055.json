    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z - 4 = 0$\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the divisors of 4, which are ±1, ±2, and ±4. By testing these values, we find that z = 1 is a root:\n\n$(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 4 = 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 0$\n\nNow that we have found a root, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n1 |  1  2  3 -4\n    |    1  3  6\n    ----------------\n      1  3  6  2\n```\n\nSo, the remaining quadratic factor is $z^2 + 3z + 2$. Factoring this, we get:\n\n$(z + 1)(z + 2)$\n\nThus, the zeros of the function are $z = 1, -1, -2$. All of these zeros have order 1, as they are simple roots.\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function. The poles are the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nFactoring this, we get:\n\n$(z - 1)(z + 1)$\n\nThus, the poles of the function are $z = 1, -1$. Both of these poles have order 1, as they are simple poles.\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z) = \\frac{z^3+2z^2+3z-4}{z^2-1}$ has 3 zeros at $z = 1, -1, -2$ and 2 poles at $z = 1, -1$. All zeros and poles have order 1."
