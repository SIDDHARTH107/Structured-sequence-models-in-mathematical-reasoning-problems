    "message_1": "Suppose that a school has 7 classrooms and wants to paint each one in one of 4 colors (red, blue, green, or yellow). How many different ways can the school paint the classrooms if no two adjacent classrooms can be the same color?",
    "message_2": "Let's use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let dp[i][j] be the number of ways to paint i classrooms such that the last classroom is painted with color j. We have 4 colors, so we can represent them as 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nBase case: For the first classroom, we have 4 choices of colors, so dp[1][1] = dp[1][2] = dp[1][3] = dp[1][4] = 1.\n\nNow, we need to fill the dp table for the remaining classrooms. For each classroom i (2 ≤ i ≤ 7) and each color j (1 ≤ j ≤ 4), we can paint the classroom with color j if the previous classroom is not painted with color j. So, we can sum the number of ways to paint the previous classroom with all colors except j.\n\ndp[i][j] = dp[i-1][1] + dp[i-1][2] + dp[i-1][3] + dp[i-1][4] - dp[i-1][j]\n\nAfter filling the dp table, the total number of ways to paint the 7 classrooms is the sum of ways to paint the last classroom with each color:\n\ntotal_ways = dp[7][1] + dp[7][2] + dp[7][3] + dp[7][4]\n\nBy calculating the values, we get:\n\ndp[2] = [3, 3, 3, 3]\ndp[3] = [9, 9, 9, 9]\ndp[4] = [27, 27, 27, 27]\ndp[5] = [81, 81, 81, 81]\ndp[6] = [243, 243, 243, 243]\ndp[7] = [729, 729, 729, 729]\n\ntotal_ways = 729 + 729 + 729 + 729 = 2916\n\nSo, there are 2916 different ways to paint the 7 classrooms with the given conditions."
