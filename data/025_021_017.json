Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose a Calabi-Yau manifold has two mirrors, one with complex structure moduli space of dimension 10 and another with complex structure moduli space of dimension 12. What is the mirror dual of a Calabi-Yau manifold whose Hodge numbers are (h^(1,1),h^(2,1))=(2,101)?",
