    "message_2": "First, let's represent the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  5 ]\n[ 2  2  2 | 10 ]\n[ 3  3  3 | 15 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix into its reduced row echelon form (RREF).\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  5 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0 ]\n[ 3  3  3 | 15 ]\n```\n\n2. Subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  5 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in its RREF. The second and third rows represent the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true and doesn't provide any information about the variables. The first row represents the equation x + y + z = 5.\n\nSince we only have one equation with three variables, we can't find a unique solution for x, y, and z. Instead, we can express the solution in terms of one or two free variables. Let's choose y and z as our free variables:\n\nx = 5 - y - z\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is given by:\n\nx = 5 - y - z\ny = y\nz = z\n\nwhere y and z can be any real numbers."
