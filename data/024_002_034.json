    "message_2": "To find the geodesic distance between two points on a surface, we need to find the shortest path between the points along the surface. In this case, the surface is a sphere with radius 2, given by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4.\n\nThe geodesic distance on a sphere is the length of the shortest arc of a great circle connecting the two points. A great circle is a circle on the sphere's surface whose center is the center of the sphere.\n\nFirst, let's find the angle θ between the two points (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, -1) using the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A and B are the position vectors of the points, and |A| and |B| are their magnitudes.\n\nA = (1, 0, 1)\nB = (-1, 0, -1)\n\n|A| = √(1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = √2\n|B| = √((-1)^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = √2\n\nA · B = (1 * -1) + (0 * 0) + (1 * -1) = -2\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\ncos(θ) = (-2) / (√2 * √2)\ncos(θ) = -1\n\nθ = arccos(-1) = π\n\nNow that we have the angle between the two points, we can find the geodesic distance along the surface of the sphere. The geodesic distance is given by the formula:\n\nGeodesic distance = radius * θ\n\nIn this case, the radius of the sphere is 2:\n\nGeodesic distance = 2 * π = 2π\n\nSo, the geodesic distance between the points (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, -1) along the surface of the given sphere is 2π."
