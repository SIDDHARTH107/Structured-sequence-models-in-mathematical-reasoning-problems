    "message_1": "In a school, there are 100 students in a class who are preparing for an exam. The probability of passing for a student is 0.8. What is the probability that at least 85 students will pass the exam?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 85 students will pass the exam, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (students passing the exam)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of trials (students)\n- k is the number of successes (students passing)\n- p is the probability of success (0.8)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (0.2)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 85 students will pass the exam, we need to calculate the probabilities for 85, 86, ..., 100 students passing the exam and sum them up.\n\nP(X >= 85) = P(X = 85) + P(X = 86) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(100, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(100-k)\n\nNow, calculate the probabilities for k = 85, 86, ..., 100 and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 85) = Σ [C(100, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(100-k)] for k = 85 to 100\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 85) ≈ 0.9648\n\nSo, the probability that at least 85 students will pass the exam is approximately 0.9648 or 96.48%."
