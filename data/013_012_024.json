    "message_1": "In a Stackelberg competition, a leader firm determines its quantity first, and then a follower firm determines its quantity. The market demand function is Q = 1000 – 10P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price of the product.\n\nThe leader firm's cost function is C1(Q1) = 2Q1, while the follower firm's cost function is C2(Q2) = 4Q2.\n\nIf the leader firm is expected to produce 400 units of the product, what would be the quantity produced by the follower firm, and what would be the corresponding price of the product in the market?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the inverse demand function, which is P(Q). To do this, we can rewrite the demand function as follows:\n\nQ = 1000 - 10P\n10P = 1000 - Q\nP = 100 - 0.1Q\n\nNow, we need to find the reaction function of the follower firm. To do this, we first find the profit function of the follower firm:\n\nπ2(Q2) = P(Q1 + Q2)Q2 - C2(Q2)\nπ2(Q2) = (100 - 0.1(Q1 + Q2))Q2 - 4Q2\n\nSince the leader firm is expected to produce 400 units, we can substitute Q1 = 400:\n\nπ2(Q2) = (100 - 0.1(400 + Q2))Q2 - 4Q2\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order condition for the profit maximization of the follower firm:\n\ndπ2(Q2)/dQ2 = 0\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to Q2:\n\ndπ2(Q2)/dQ2 = -0.1(100 - 0.1(400 + Q2)) + 0.1Q2 - 4\n\nSetting the first-order condition equal to 0:\n\n-0.1(100 - 0.1(400 + Q2)) + 0.1Q2 - 4 = 0\n\nSolving for Q2:\n\n-10 + Q2 - 4 = 0\nQ2 = 14\n\nSo, the follower firm would produce 14 units of the product.\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding price of the product in the market using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 100 - 0.1(Q1 + Q2)\nP = 100 - 0.1(400 + 14)\nP = 100 - 0.1(414)\nP = 100 - 41.4\nP = 58.6\n\nTherefore, the quantity produced by the follower firm would be 14 units, and the corresponding price of the product in the market would be $58.6."
