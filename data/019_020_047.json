    "message_2": "To implement the given boolean function f(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz using NAND gates, we can first convert it into an equivalent expression using only NAND operations. \n\nWe can use De Morgan's law and the properties of NAND gates to find an equivalent expression:\n\n1. Replace AND operation with NAND: xy = (x NAND y) NAND (x NAND y)\n2. Replace OR operation with NAND: A + B = (A NAND A) NAND (B NAND B)\n\nUsing these rules, we can rewrite the given function:\n\nf(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz\n= (x NAND y) NAND (x NAND y) + (y NAND z) NAND (y NAND z) + (x NAND z) NAND (x NAND z)\n= ((x NAND y) NAND (x NAND y)) NAND ((y NAND z) NAND (y NAND z)) NAND ((x NAND z) NAND (x NAND z))\n\nNow, let's count the number of NAND gates required:\n\n1. 2 gates for (x NAND y)\n2. 2 gates for (y NAND z)\n3. 2 gates for (x NAND z)\n4. 1 gate for ((x NAND y) NAND (x NAND y))\n5. 1 gate for ((y NAND z) NAND (y NAND z))\n6. 1 gate for ((x NAND z) NAND (x NAND z))\n7. 1 gate for the final NAND operation\n\nIn total, we need a minimum of 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 NAND gates to implement the given boolean function f(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz."
