    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the cartesian product of $(A \\Delta B) \\times (B\\Delta A)$ and $(B \\Delta A) \\times (A\\Delta B)$ and show that they are not equal.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted by A Δ B. The symmetric difference consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\nB Δ A = {1, 4} (since the symmetric difference is commutative)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the two sets:\n\n(A Δ B) × (B Δ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\n(B Δ A) × (A Δ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) × (B Δ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)} and (B Δ A) × (A Δ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}. Both Cartesian products are equal. Therefore, the statement that they are not equal is false."
