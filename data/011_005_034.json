    "message_2": "To find the number of different photos that can be taken with 4 people out of 6 friends, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (6) and k is the number of friends in each photo (4).\n\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4!(6-4)!)\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4!2!)\nC(6, 4) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(2*1))\nC(6, 4) = 720 / (24*2)\nC(6, 4) = 720 / 48\nC(6, 4) = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 different photos that can be taken with 4 people out of the 6 friends."
