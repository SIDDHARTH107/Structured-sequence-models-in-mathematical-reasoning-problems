    "message_1": "A student is preparing to take a trip and wants to pack their backpack as efficiently as possible. The backpack has a capacity of 15 pounds. The student needs to pack items with the following weights: 2 lbs, 5 lbs, 9 lbs, 7 lbs, and 3 lbs. Using the Knapsack problem, what is the maximum weight of items the student can pack in their backpack?",
    "message_2": "To solve the Knapsack problem, we will use dynamic programming. We will create a table with rows representing the items and columns representing the weights from 0 to the maximum capacity of the backpack (15 lbs). The table will be filled with the maximum value that can be obtained by including or excluding items.\n\nHere's the table for the given problem:\n\nWeights: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nItem 2:  0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  2  2  2  2  2  2\nItem 5:  0 0 2 2 2 5 5 7 7 7  7  7  7  7  7  7\nItem 9:  0 0 2 2 2 5 5 7 7 9  9 11 11 11 11 11\nItem 7:  0 0 2 2 2 5 5 7 7 9  9 11 11 12 12 14\nItem 3:  0 0 2 3 3 5 5 7 8 9 10 11 11 12 13 14\n\nThe maximum weight that can be packed in the backpack is 14 lbs, which can be achieved by packing items with weights 2 lbs, 5 lbs, and 7 lbs."
