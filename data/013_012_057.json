    "message_1": "In a Stackelberg Competition, a firm is a leader and another firm is a follower. The leader firm has a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit, while the follower's marginal cost is $15 per unit. The inverse demand function for the product is P = 100 - Q, where P is the price per unit and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms.\n\nIf the leader firm can set its output level first and the follower's output level is a best response to the leader's output level, what is the profit-maximizing output and price for both firms?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing output and price for both firms, we need to first find the reaction function of the follower firm. The follower firm's profit function is given by:\n\nπ_F = (P - MC_F) * q_F = (100 - Q - MC_F) * q_F = (100 - (q_L + q_F) - 15) * q_F = (85 - q_L - q_F) * q_F\n\nTo maximize its profit, the follower firm will set its marginal revenue equal to its marginal cost:\n\nMR_F = MC_F\n\nThe marginal revenue for the follower firm is the derivative of its revenue function with respect to q_F:\n\nMR_F = d(85q_F - q_Lq_F - q_F^2)/dq_F = 85 - q_L - 2q_F\n\nSetting MR_F equal to MC_F:\n\n85 - q_L - 2q_F = 15\n\nSolving for q_F, we get the reaction function of the follower firm:\n\nq_F = (70 - q_L) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the leader firm's profit-maximizing output level. The leader firm's profit function is given by:\n\nπ_L = (P - MC_L) * q_L = (100 - Q - MC_L) * q_L = (100 - (q_L + q_F) - 10) * q_L = (90 - q_L - q_F) * q_L\n\nSubstitute the follower's reaction function into the leader's profit function:\n\nπ_L = (90 - q_L - (70 - q_L) / 2) * q_L = (110 - 3q_L / 2) * q_L\n\nTo maximize its profit, the leader firm will set its marginal revenue equal to its marginal cost:\n\nMR_L = MC_L\n\nThe marginal revenue for the leader firm is the derivative of its revenue function with respect to q_L:\n\nMR_L = d(110q_L - 3q_L^2 / 2)/dq_L = 110 - 3q_L\n\nSetting MR_L equal to MC_L:\n\n110 - 3q_L = 10\n\nSolving for q_L, we get the leader's profit-maximizing output level:\n\nq_L = 100 / 3 ≈ 33.33\n\nNow, we can find the follower's profit-maximizing output level using its reaction function:\n\nq_F = (70 - q_L) / 2 = (70 - 100 / 3) / 2 ≈ 16.67\n\nFinally, we can find the profit-maximizing price using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 100 - Q = 100 - (q_L + q_F) = 100 - (33.33 + 16.67) = 100 - 50 = $50\n\nSo, the profit-maximizing output levels for the leader and follower firms are approximately 33.33 units and 16.67 units, respectively, and the profit-maximizing price is $50 per unit."
