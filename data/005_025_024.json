    "message_1": "A company claims that their production line produces light bulbs with a mean lifetime of 1000 hours with a standard deviation of 200 hours. A math student wants to test this claim and took a sample of 25 bulbs from the production line, which resulted in a mean lifetime of 960 hours. Is the student's sample mean within the range that we would expect from the company's claim? Calculate the confidence interval at 95% confidence level for the true mean lifetime of the light bulbs produced by the company.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime of the light bulbs produced by the company, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence level is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nGiven the information, we have:\n\nSample Mean = 960 hours\nStandard Deviation = 200 hours\nSample Size = 25\n\nNow, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 200 / √(25) = 200 / 5 = 40 hours\n\nNext, we'll find the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 40 = 78.4 hours\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 960 ± 78.4\nConfidence Interval = (881.6, 1038.4)\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime of the light bulbs produced by the company is (881.6 hours, 1038.4 hours). Since the company's claim of a mean lifetime of 1000 hours falls within this interval, the student's sample mean of 960 hours is within the range that we would expect from the company's claim."
