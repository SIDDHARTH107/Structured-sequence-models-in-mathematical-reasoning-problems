    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A • B) / ||B||\n\nwhere A • B is the dot product of the two vectors, and ||B|| is the magnitude of vector B.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\nA • B = ||A|| * ||B|| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, respectively, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nA • B = 5 * 6 * cos(30°)\nA • B = 30 * (sqrt(3)/2)\nA • B = 15 * sqrt(3)\n\nNow, let's find the projection of vector A onto vector B:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (15 * sqrt(3)) / 6\nProjection of A onto B = 2.5 * sqrt(3)\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B is 2.5 * sqrt(3) units."
