    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nThe given equation is:\nF(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xyz = 0\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n\nWe can simplify these equations by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\n\nNow, let's solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\nyz = x^2\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\ny^2 - x(x^2) = 0\ny^2 - x^3 = 0\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) yz = x^2\n2) y^2 - x^3 = 0\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express y^2 as:\ny^2 = x^3\n\nSubstitute this into equation (1):\ny(x^3) = x^2\nyx^3 = x^2\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: x = 0\nIn this case, from equation (2), we have y^2 = 0, which implies y = 0. So, the point (0, 0) is a singular point.\n\nCase 2: y = 0\nIn this case, from equation (1), we have x^2 = 0, which implies x = 0. So, the point (0, 0) is a singular point again.\n\nThus, the only singular point of the algebraic variety V is (0, 0)."
