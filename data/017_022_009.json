    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 * 5, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2^2 * 5, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 2^2 * 3, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1, 4, or 12.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since these subgroups are unique, they are all normal in G. The order of P_2 is 4, the order of P_3 is 3, and the order of P_5 is 5. Since the orders of these subgroups are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 60. Thus, G is isomorphic to C60.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 4 or 12\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, both of which are normal in G. The order of P_2 is 4, and the order of P_3 is 3. Since the orders of these subgroups are coprime, G has a normal subgroup isomorphic to P_2 × P_3, which is isomorphic to C12. The quotient group G/(P_2 × P_3) has order 5, so it is isomorphic to C5. By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is an extension of C5 by C12. There are two such extensions: the direct product C5 × C12, which is isomorphic to C60, and the semidirect product C5 ⋊ C12, which is isomorphic to A5 × C2.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 or 15, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 4 or 12\nIn this case, G has no normal Sylow subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, G has at least one Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4, one Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, and one Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. The group G acts on the set of its Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_n_2. The kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal 2-subgroup of G, which is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_n_2. Since n_2 = 3 or 15, S_n_2 is isomorphic to either S3 or S15. In either case, S_n_2 has a normal subgroup isomorphic to A3 or A15, which has index 2. By the correspondence theorem, G has a normal subgroup N of index 2. The quotient group G/N has order 2, so it is isomorphic to C2. By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is an extension of N by C2. There are 32 such extensions, which are the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 60 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
