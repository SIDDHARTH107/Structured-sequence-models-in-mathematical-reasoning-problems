    "message_2": "A Latin square of order 4 is a 4x4 grid where each row and each column contains the integers 1 to 4 exactly once. To count the number of distinct Latin squares, we can consider the possible arrangements of the rows.\n\n1. The first row can be any permutation of the integers 1 to 4. There are 4! = 24 possible permutations for the first row.\n\n2. The second row must have a different arrangement from the first row. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations for the second row.\n\n3. The third row must have a different arrangement from the first two rows. There are 2 possible permutations for the third row.\n\n4. The fourth row is determined by the first three rows since each column must contain the integers 1 to 4 exactly once. There is only 1 possible permutation for the fourth row.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct Latin squares of order 4 is 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288."
