    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is given by:\n\nln([A]t / [A]0) = -kt\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of A at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of A, k is the rate constant, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nWe are given the initial concentration [A]0 = 2 mol/L, the rate constant k = 0.005 s^-1, and the time t = 1000 seconds. We want to find the concentration of A after 1000 seconds, [A]t.\n\nRearranging the integrated rate law equation to solve for [A]t:\n\n[A]t = [A]0 * e^(-kt)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n[A]t = 2 mol/L * e^(-0.005 s^-1 * 1000 s)\n\n[A]t = 2 mol/L * e^(-5)\n\n[A]t ≈ 2 mol/L * 0.00674\n\n[A]t ≈ 0.01348 mol/L\n\nThe concentration of A after 1000 seconds is approximately 0.01348 mol/L."
