    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of vertices that can be chosen such that each edge is adjacent to at least one chosen vertex, we can use the concept of vertex cover.\n\nA vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. The problem of finding the minimum vertex cover is an optimization problem, and it can be solved using various algorithms.\n\nIn this case, we can find the minimum vertex cover by inspection. We can choose the following vertices: {2, 4, 6}. This set of vertices covers all the edges in the graph:\n\n- Vertex 2 covers edges (1,2), (2,3), (2,5), and (2,7).\n- Vertex 4 covers edges (3,4), (4,5), and (4,7).\n- Vertex 6 covers edges (5,6), (6,7), and (1,6).\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices that can be chosen such that each edge is adjacent to at least one chosen vertex is 3."
