    "message_1": "A survey of a group of 500 consumers showed that 70% of them prefer to buy brand A when shopping for electronics. What is the probability that out of a random sample of 10 consumers, 8 or more will prefer brand A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of consumers in the sample), k is the number of successes (consumers who prefer brand A), p is the probability of success (70% or 0.7), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe want to find the probability that 8 or more consumers prefer brand A, so we need to calculate the probabilities for 8, 9, and 10 consumers and then add them together.\n\nP(X = 8) = (10 choose 8) * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2\nP(X = 9) = (10 choose 9) * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1\nP(X = 10) = (10 choose 10) * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0\n\nUsing the binomial coefficient formula for (n choose k):\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nP(X = 8) = (10! / (8!2!)) * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2 ≈ 0.120932\nP(X = 9) = (10! / (9!1!)) * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1 ≈ 0.040310\nP(X = 10) = (10! / (10!0!)) * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0 ≈ 0.028248\n\nNow, add the probabilities together:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) ≈ 0.120932 + 0.040310 + 0.028248 ≈ 0.189490\n\nSo, the probability that 8 or more consumers out of a random sample of 10 prefer brand A is approximately 18.95%."
