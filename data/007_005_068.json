    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 15, 20, and 25 can be found by first finding the prime factors of each number and then multiplying the highest powers of each prime factor together.\n\n15 = 3 × 5\n20 = 2² × 5\n25 = 5²\n\nThe highest powers of each prime factor are: 2², 3, and 5².\n\nNow, multiply these together:\n\n2² × 3 × 5² = 4 × 3 × 25 = 12 × 25 = 300\n\nSo, the LCM of 15, 20, and 25 is 300."
