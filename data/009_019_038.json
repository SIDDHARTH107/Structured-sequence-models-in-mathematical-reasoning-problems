If X(0) = 1 and the particle begins at time t=0, what is the probability that the particle's position is greater than 4 at time t=2?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) and then find the probability that the particle's position is greater than 4 at time t=2.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the SDE in the form of an Ito integral:\n\ndX = 2X dt + 3 dB(t)\n\nNow, we can apply Ito's lemma to find the solution to the SDE. Ito's lemma states that if X(t) is an Ito process and f(X(t), t) is a twice-differentiable function, then:\n\ndf(X(t), t) = (∂f/∂t) dt + (∂f/∂X) dX + (1/2)(∂²f/∂X²) (dX)²\n\nLet f(X(t), t) = ln(X(t)). Then:\n\n∂f/∂t = 0\n∂f/∂X = 1/X\n∂²f/∂X² = -1/X²\n\nApplying Ito's lemma, we get:\n\nd(ln(X(t))) = (1/X) dX - (1/2X²) (3²) dt\n\nSubstituting the given SDE into the equation:\n\nd(ln(X(t))) = (1/X) (2X dt + 3 dB(t)) - (1/2X²) (9) dt\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd(ln(X(t))) = 2 dt + 3 dB(t) - 9/2 dt\n\nIntegrating both sides from 0 to t:\n\nln(X(t)) - ln(X(0)) = ∫(2 - 9/2) ds + ∫3 dB(s) from 0 to t\n\nSince X(0) = 1, ln(X(0)) = 0. Thus,\n\nln(X(t)) = ∫(-1/2) ds + ∫3 dB(s) from 0 to t\n\nNow, we can find the solution to the SDE:\n\nX(t) = exp(-1/2 * t + 3 * B(t))\n\nWe want to find the probability that X(2) > 4. Let Y = X(2):\n\nY = exp(-1 + 3 * B(2))\n\nNow, we can use the properties of Brownian motion to find the probability. B(2) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 2. Let Z = 3 * B(2). Then, Z is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 3² * 2 = 18.\n\nWe want to find P(Y > 4):\n\nP(Y > 4) = P(exp(-1 + Z) > 4)\nP(Z > ln(4) + 1) = P(Z > 2.386)\n\nNow, we can standardize Z:\n\nP((Z - 0) / sqrt(18) > (2.386 - 0) / sqrt(18)) = P(Z* > 0.562)\n\nWhere Z* is a standard normal random variable. Using a standard normal table or calculator, we find that:\n\nP(Z* > 0.562) ≈ 1 - 0.7123 = 0.2877\n\nTherefore, the probability that the particle's position is greater than 4 at time t=2 is approximately 0.2877 or 28.77%."
