    "message_2": "To solve the homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 3 -4  5 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the coefficients below the pivot element (1) in the first column.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 3 * Row1:\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -10  8 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 | 0 ]\n```\n\nRow3 = Row3 - 2 * Row1:\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -10  8 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -5  5 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by the pivot element (-10) to get a 1 in the second row and second column.\n\nRow2 = Row2 / -10:\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -0.8 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -5  5 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the coefficients below the pivot element (1) in the second column.\n\nRow3 = Row3 + 5 * Row2:\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -0.8 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow we have the matrix in row-echelon form, and we can use back-substitution to find the solutions.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 0.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - 0.8z = 0, which gives y = 0.8z = 0.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + 2y - z = 0, which gives x = z - 2y = 0.\n\nSince this is a homogeneous system, the trivial solution (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) is a valid solution."
