    "message_2": "To construct a DFA that accepts the language consisting of all strings over {0,1} that contain an even number of 1's, we need to keep track of whether we have seen an even or odd number of 1's so far. We can do this using two states:\n\n1. State q0: The initial state, representing that we have seen an even number of 1's so far.\n2. State q1: Representing that we have seen an odd number of 1's so far.\n\nNow, we define the transition function as follows:\n\n- From state q0, if we read a 0, we stay in q0 (since the number of 1's remains even).\n- From state q0, if we read a 1, we move to q1 (since the number of 1's becomes odd).\n- From state q1, if we read a 0, we stay in q1 (since the number of 1's remains odd).\n- From state q1, if we read a 1, we move back to q0 (since the number of 1's becomes even again).\n\nFinally, we define the set of accepting states. Since we want to accept strings with an even number of 1's, we make q0 the accepting state.\n\nSo, the minimum number of states required for a DFA that accepts the language consisting of all strings over {0,1} that contain an even number of 1's is 2."
