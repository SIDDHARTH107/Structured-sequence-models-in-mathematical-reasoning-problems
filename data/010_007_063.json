    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of X, we first need to understand the space X obtained by identifying opposite sides of a square. This space is known as the real projective plane, denoted as ℝP².\n\nTo visualize this, imagine a square with sides labeled a, b, a, and b (in that order, clockwise). Now, we identify the opposite sides with the same label, which means we \"glue\" the sides together. When we glue the 'a' sides together, we get a cylinder. Next, when we glue the 'b' sides together, we obtain the real projective plane.\n\nNow, let's find the fundamental group of ℝP². To do this, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B whose intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X, denoted π₁(X), can be computed from the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B.\n\nLet's choose A and B as follows:\n\n- A: ℝP² with a small open disk removed from its center.\n- B: A small open disk centered at the center of ℝP².\n\nBoth A and B are open and path-connected, and their intersection A ∩ B is an annulus, which is also path-connected.\n\nNow, let's find the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B:\n\n- π₁(A): Since A is ℝP² with a small open disk removed, it is homotopy equivalent to the boundary of the square with the identifications made. This boundary is a wedge sum of two circles, and its fundamental group is the free group on two generators, say a and b, which represent the identified sides of the square. So, π₁(A) = ⟨a, b⟩.\n- π₁(B): B is an open disk, which is contractible. Therefore, its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., π₁(B) = {1}.\n- π₁(A ∩ B): A ∩ B is an annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle. Its fundamental group is the infinite cyclic group, say generated by the element c. So, π₁(A ∩ B) = ⟨c⟩.\n\nNow, we apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem:\n\nπ₁(ℝP²) = π₁(A) * π₁(B) / N, where N is the normal subgroup generated by the relations between the generators of π₁(A) and π₁(A ∩ B).\n\nSince π₁(B) is trivial, the theorem simplifies to:\n\nπ₁(ℝP²) = π₁(A) / N.\n\nNow, we need to find the relations between the generators of π₁(A) and π₁(A ∩ B). In A ∩ B, the loop c can be deformed into the loop a * b * a⁻¹ * b⁻¹ in A. Therefore, the relation is:\n\nc = a * b * a⁻¹ * b⁻¹.\n\nNow, we can compute the fundamental group of ℝP²:\n\nπ₁(ℝP²) = ⟨a, b | a * b * a⁻¹ * b⁻¹⟩.\n\nThis is the presentation of the fundamental group of the real projective plane, which is known as the Klein four-group or Z₂ × Z₂."
