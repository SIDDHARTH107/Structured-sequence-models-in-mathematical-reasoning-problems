    "message_2": "To find the number of different committees of 4 students that can be formed from a group of 10 students, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (10 in this case) and k is the number of students in the committee (4 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes the factorial of a number, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the combination formula:\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / (24 × 720)\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / 17,280\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different committees of 4 students that can be formed from a group of 10 students."
