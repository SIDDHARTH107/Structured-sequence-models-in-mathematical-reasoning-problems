    "message_1": "A company states that the average wait time for their customer service hotline is less than 3 minutes. A random sample of 36 customers had an average wait time of 2.6 minutes with a standard deviation of 1.2 minutes. Using a significance level of 0.05, can we reject the company's claim? What is the conclusion of your hypothesis test?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average wait time is equal to or greater than 3 minutes, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average wait time is less than 3 minutes.\n\nH0: μ ≥ 3\nH1: μ < 3\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 36\nSample mean (x̄) = 2.6 minutes\nSample standard deviation (s) = 1.2 minutes\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score:\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (2.6 - 3) / (1.2 / √36)\nt = (-0.4) / (1.2 / 6)\nt = -0.4 / 0.2\nt = -2\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed test with 35 degrees of freedom (n - 1) and a significance level of 0.05. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.69.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-2) is less than the critical t-value (-1.69), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: Based on the hypothesis test at a 0.05 significance level, we have enough evidence to reject the company's claim that the average wait time is less than 3 minutes."
