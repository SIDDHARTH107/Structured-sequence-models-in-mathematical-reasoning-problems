    "message_1": "A company produces two products: product A and product B. The company can produce a maximum of 400 units per week of product A and a maximum of 600 units per week of product B. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor while each unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a total of 1600 hours of labor available per week. The profit per unit of product A is $5 while the profit per unit of product B is $8. What is the maximum weekly profit that the company can make if it uses the cuckoo search algorithm to solve this optimization problem?",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem, we need to find the optimal number of units of product A and product B that the company should produce to maximize its profit, given the constraints on production capacity and labor hours.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 8y\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. Production capacity:\nx ≤ 400 (maximum units of product A)\ny ≤ 600 (maximum units of product B)\n\n2. Labor hours:\n2x + 3y ≤ 1600 (total labor hours available)\n\nNow, we can use the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit function P(x, y) while satisfying the constraints.\n\nHowever, as an AI, I am unable to execute the cuckoo search algorithm. Instead, I will solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x = 0 (y-axis)\n2. y = 0 (x-axis)\n3. x = 400\n4. y = 600\n5. 2x + 3y = 1600\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of these lines. The vertices are:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(400, 0)\nC(400, 200)\nD(200, 600)\nE(0, 533.33)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\nP(B) = 5(400) + 8(0) = $2000\nP(C) = 5(400) + 8(200) = $3600\nP(D) = 5(200) + 8(600) = $5800\nP(E) = 5(0) + 8(533.33) = $4266.64\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex D, where the company produces 200 units of product A and 600 units of product B. The maximum weekly profit is $5800."
