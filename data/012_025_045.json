    "message_1": "Consider a complete graph `K6` with six vertices (numbered from 1 to 6). Each edge in the graph has a weight equal to the absolute difference between the two vertices it connects. Find the Hamiltonian cycle in the graph that has the smallest total weight.",
    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. To find the Hamiltonian cycle with the smallest total weight, we want to minimize the sum of the weights of the edges in the cycle.\n\nLet's list the edges and their weights for the complete graph K6:\n\n(1,2): 1\n(1,3): 2\n(1,4): 3\n(1,5): 4\n(1,6): 5\n(2,3): 1\n(2,4): 2\n(2,5): 3\n(2,6): 4\n(3,4): 1\n(3,5): 2\n(3,6): 3\n(4,5): 1\n(4,6): 2\n(5,6): 1\n\nTo minimize the total weight, we should try to use edges with smaller weights. We can start with vertex 1 and try to find a Hamiltonian cycle:\n\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 1\n\nThe total weight of this cycle is:\n\n(1,2) + (2,3) + (3,4) + (4,5) + (5,6) + (6,1)\n= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5\n= 10\n\nThis Hamiltonian cycle has a total weight of 10. Since we used the smallest possible weights for each step, this is the Hamiltonian cycle with the smallest total weight in the graph K6."
