    "message_2": "To find the point $[C]$ in $M_{1,1}$ that corresponds to the elliptic curve $C: y^2 = x^3 - x^2 + 1$, we first need to find a transformation that brings the curve into the standard Weierstrass form, which is given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$.\n\nLet's perform a change of variables to eliminate the $x^2$ term. Let $x = u + 1$, then the equation becomes:\n\n$y^2 = (u + 1)^3 - (u + 1)^2 + 1$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$y^2 = u^3 + 3u^2 + 3u + 1 - u^2 - 2u - 1 + 1$\n\n$y^2 = u^3 + 2u^2 + u$\n\nNow, we have the curve in the standard Weierstrass form, with $A = 2$ and $B = 1$. The $j$-invariant of an elliptic curve in Weierstrass form is given by the formula:\n\n$j = 1728 \\frac{4A^3}{4A^3 + 27B^2}$\n\nPlugging in the values of $A$ and $B$, we get:\n\n$j = 1728 \\frac{4(2)^3}{4(2)^3 + 27(1)^2}$\n\n$j = 1728 \\frac{32}{32 + 27}$\n\n$j = 1728 \\frac{32}{59}$\n\nSo, the point $[C]$ in $M_{1,1}$ that corresponds to the elliptic curve $C: y^2 = x^3 - x^2 + 1$ is given by the $j$-invariant $j = 1728 \\frac{32}{59}$."
