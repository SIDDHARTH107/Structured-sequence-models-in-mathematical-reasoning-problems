    "message_2": "To find the girth of G (the length of the shortest cycle in the graph), we can use the inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor((m + 1) / n) + 1\n\nwhere m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIn our case, m = 21 and n = 12. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor((21 + 1) / 12) + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor(22 / 12) + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor(1.8333) + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 1 + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 3\n\nSince the girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle, and a cycle must have at least 3 vertices, the girth of G is 3."
