    "message_2": "Let's use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successful trials\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- p = 0.5 (probability of correctly guessing a number)\n- n = 4 (number of guesses)\n\nWe want to find the probability of the magician correctly guessing the number at least 2 times, which means we need to find the probability for 2, 3, and 4 correct guesses and then sum them up.\n\nFor 2 correct guesses (k = 2):\n\nP(X = 2) = C(4, 2) * (0.5)^2 * (1-0.5)^(4-2)\nP(X = 2) = (4! / (2!(4-2)!)) * (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^2\nP(X = 2) = (24 / (2*2)) * (0.25) * (0.25)\nP(X = 2) = 6 * 0.0625\nP(X = 2) = 0.375\n\nFor 3 correct guesses (k = 3):\n\nP(X = 3) = C(4, 3) * (0.5)^3 * (1-0.5)^(4-3)\nP(X = 3) = (4! / (3!(4-3)!)) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^1\nP(X = 3) = (24 / (6*1)) * (0.125) * (0.5)\nP(X = 3) = 4 * 0.0625\nP(X = 3) = 0.25\n\nFor 4 correct guesses (k = 4):\n\nP(X = 4) = C(4, 4) * (0.5)^4 * (1-0.5)^(4-4)\nP(X = 4) = (4! / (4!(4-4)!)) * (0.5)^4 * (0.5)^0\nP(X = 4) = (24 / (24*1)) * (0.0625) * (1)\nP(X = 4) = 1 * 0.0625\nP(X = 4) = 0.0625\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities for 2, 3, and 4 correct guesses:\n\nP(X >= 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\nP(X >= 2) = 0.375 + 0.25 + 0.0625\nP(X >= 2) = 0.6875\n\nSo, the probability that the magician correctly guesses the number at least 2 times in 4 guesses is 0.6875 or 68.75%."
