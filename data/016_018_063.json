    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (also known as the similarity dimension) of a self-similar set like the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, after each iteration, we are left with 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2) after removing the middle third of each remaining segment. The scaling factor is 3, as each remaining segment is 1/3 the length of the previous segment (s = 3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not depend on the initial length of the line segment or the number of iterations. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.6309, regardless of the initial length (9 cm) and the number of iterations (4 times)."
