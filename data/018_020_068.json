The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {3} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A Δ B) and {2, 4}:\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ {2, 4} = {1, 2, 4, 5} ∪ {2, 4} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference operation is distributive over union. To do this, we need to show that:\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ C = (A ∪ C) Δ (B ∪ C)\n\nLet C = {2, 4}.
