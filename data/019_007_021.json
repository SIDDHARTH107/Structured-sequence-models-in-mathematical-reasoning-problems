    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a precise numerical problem for the sub-topic Non-monotonic Logic as it deals with the reasoning of uncertain or incomplete information. It is more focused on arguments that are likely to be true based on evidence, but not necessarily certain. Therefore, it is not suitable for numerical problems. Could you please suggest another sub-topic for me to generate a question?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Please provide another sub-topic or specific mathematical concept, and I will generate a question for you."
