    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in this network, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path: S -> A -> B -> T. The bottleneck capacity is 3. We update the residual capacities:\n\n```\n           0            \n      A ------- B      \n     /  |      /  \\     \n    /   |6    /    \\    \n   /    |    /      \\   \n  /     |  /         \\  \n S      | /           T\n  \\     |/             \\\n   \\    |2            / \n    \\   |            /  \n     \\  |           /   \n      C ------- D      \n           4            \n```\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: S -> A -> C -> D -> T. The bottleneck capacity is 2. We update the residual capacities:\n\n```\n           0            \n      A ------- B      \n     /  |      /  \\     \n    /   |4    /    \\    \n   /    |    /      \\   \n  /     |  /         \\  \n S      | /           T\n  \\     |/             \\\n   \\    |0            / \n    \\   |            /  \n     \\  |           /   \n      C ------- D      \n           2            \n```\n\n3. Now, we find another augmenting path: S -> C -> D -> T. The bottleneck capacity is 2. We update the residual capacities:\n\n```\n           0            \n      A ------- B      \n     /  |      /  \\     \n    /   |4    /    \\    \n   /    |    /      \\   \n  /     |  /         \\  \n S      | /           T\n  \\     |/             \\\n   \\    |0            / \n    \\   |            /  \n     \\  |           /   \n      C ------- D      \n           0            \n```\n\nAt this point, there are no more augmenting paths from S to T. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows on the paths we found: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. So, the maximum flow that can be sent from the source vertex S to the sink vertex T in this network is 7."
