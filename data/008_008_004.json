    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, product A and B. Each product requires time to manufacture and time to assemble. The factory has 32 hours of manufacturing time and 44 hours of assembly time per week. For each unit of product A produced, the profit is $500, and for each unit of product B produced, the profit is $600. The manufacturing time required for each unit of product A and B is 3 and 2 hours, respectively, and the assembly time required for each unit of product A and B is 2 and 4 hours, respectively. Determine the optimal number of units of each product to be produced to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 500x + 600y\n\nThe constraints are given by the available manufacturing and assembly time:\n3x + 2y ≤ 32 (manufacturing time constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 44 (assembly time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y = 32\ny = (32 - 3x) / 2\n\n2x + 4y = 44\ny = (44 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. The vertices are (0, 0), (0, 11), (8, 6), and (10.67, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit:\n\nP(0, 0) = 500(0) + 600(0) = $0\nP(0, 11) = 500(0) + 600(11) = $6,600\nP(8, 6) = 500(8) + 600(6) = $4,000 + $3,600 = $7,600\nP(10.67, 0) = 500(10.67) + 600(0) = $5,335 (Note: x must be an integer, so this point is not feasible)\n\nThe maximum profit of $7,600 is achieved when producing 8 units of product A and 6 units of product B."
