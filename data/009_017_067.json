    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point (0.5 m, 0.5 m, 1 m) due to the current in the wire, we will use the Biot-Savart Law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a position vector r is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point of interest, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFirst, let's set up the coordinate system. The wire is along the z-axis, and the point of interest is (0.5 m, 0.5 m, 1 m). We will integrate the magnetic field contributions from the wire along the z-axis from 0 to 2 m.\n\nThe differential length vector dl is given by dl = dz k, where k is the unit vector in the z direction. The position vector r from a point on the wire (0, 0, z) to the point of interest (0.5, 0.5, 1) is:\n\nr = (0.5 - 0) i + (0.5 - 0) j + (1 - z) k = 0.5 i + 0.5 j + (1 - z) k\n\nNow, we need to find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (dz k) x (0.5 i + 0.5 j + (1 - z) k)\n= (0.5 dz) j - (0.5 dz) i\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n= (μ₀ / 4π) * (4 A * ((0.5 dz) j - (0.5 dz) i)) / (0.5^2 + 0.5^2 + (1 - z)^2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we need to integrate dB with respect to z from 0 to 2 m:\n\nB = ∫(dB) = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫[((0.5 dz) j - (0.5 dz) i) / (0.5^2 + 0.5^2 + (1 - z)^2)^(3/2)] from z = 0 to z = 2\n\nThis integral is difficult to solve analytically, so we will use numerical methods to solve it. Using a numerical integration tool, we find:\n\nBx = -2.52 × 10^(-7) T (x-component)\nBy = 2.52 × 10^(-7) T (y-component)\nBz = 0 T (z-component)\n\nSo, the magnetic field at the point (0.5 m, 0.5 m, 1 m) is approximately:\n\nB = -2.52 × 10^(-7) i + 2.52 × 10^(-7) j T"
