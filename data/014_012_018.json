The Vigenere square is a 26x26 table of letters, where each row is shifted one position to the left compared to the previous row. To find the ciphertext letter, we look for the intersection of the row corresponding to the message letter and the column corresponding to the keyword letter.\n\nH (7) + M (12) = S (18)\nE (4) + A (0) = E (4)\nL (11) + T (19) = B (1)\nL (11) + H (7) = S (18)\nO (14) + S (18) = I (8)\n\nThe resulting ciphertext is \"SEBSI\"."
