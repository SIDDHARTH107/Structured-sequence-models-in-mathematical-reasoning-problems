    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 1 and the third equation by -1:\n\n(1) * (2x + 3y - z) = (1) * 5\n(-1) * (4x + 2y - z) = (-1) * 1\n\nThis gives us:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 5\n-4x - 2y + z = -1\n\nNow, we can add these two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(2x + 3y - z) + (-4x - 2y + z) = 5 + (-1)\n\n-2x + y = 4 (Equation A)\n\nNext, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 1 and the third equation by 3:\n\n(1) * (6x - 5y + 3z) = (1) * 7\n(3) * (4x + 2y - z) = (3) * 1\n\nThis gives us:\n\n6x - 5y + 3z = 7\n12x + 6y - 3z = 3\n\nNow, we can add these two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(6x - 5y + 3z) + (12x + 6y - 3z) = 7 + 3\n\n18x + y = 10 (Equation B)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n-2x + y = 4 (Equation A)\n18x + y = 10 (Equation B)\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying Equation A by -1 and adding it to Equation B:\n\n(-1) * (-2x + y) = (-1) * 4\n18x + y = 10\n\nThis gives us:\n\n2x - y = -4\n18x + y = 10\n\nNow, we can add these two equations to eliminate y:\n\n(2x - y) + (18x + y) = -4 + 10\n\n20x = 6\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 6 / 20\nx = 3 / 10\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into Equation A or B to find the value of y. We will use Equation A:\n\n-2x + y = 4\n-2(3/10) + y = 4\n-6/10 + y = 4\n\ny = 4 + 6/10\ny = 4 + 3/5\ny = 23/5\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of x and y back into any of the original equations to find the value of z. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 5\n2(3/10) + 3(23/5) - z = 5\n6/10 + 69/5 - z = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = 6/10 + 69/5 - 5\nz = 3/5 + 69/5 - 25/5\nz = 47/5\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 3/10\ny = 23/5\nz = 47/5"
