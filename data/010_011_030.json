    "message_1": "Consider a closed orientable manifold M of dimension 3. Suppose that the fundamental group of M is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_n of order 2n for n >= 3. Determine the possible diffeomorphism classes of M.",
    "message_2": "To determine the possible diffeomorphism classes of M, we will use the fact that the fundamental group of a closed 3-manifold determines its homotopy type, and that the homotopy type of a closed 3-manifold determines its diffeomorphism class up to finite ambiguity.\n\nRecall that the dihedral group D_n is generated by two elements, r and s, with relations r^n = s^2 = 1 and srs = r^(-1). We can think of D_n as the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon in the plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the universal cover of M, which we will denote by X. Since M is a closed orientable 3-manifold, X is a simply connected closed 3-manifold. By the geometrization theorem, X can be decomposed into pieces with one of the eight Thurston geometries (Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, H^2 x R, S^2 x R, Nil, Sol, or SL(2,R)).\n\nSince the fundamental group of M is non-abelian, the universal cover X cannot have Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic geometry. Moreover, since M is orientable, X cannot have Nil or Sol geometry. Thus, X must have one of the remaining three geometries: H^2 x R, S^2 x R, or SL(2,R).\n\nNow, let's consider the action of the fundamental group of M on X. Since the fundamental group is D_n, we can think of it as acting by isometries on X. In particular, we can think of r as acting by a rotation of order n and s as acting by a reflection.\n\n1. If X has H^2 x R geometry, then the action of D_n on X must preserve the H^2 factor. In this case, the quotient space M = X/D_n is a Seifert fiber space with base orbifold a 2-dimensional sphere with n cone points of order 2. The classification of Seifert fiber spaces then implies that M is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of n copies of RP^3#RP^3, where RP^3 denotes the real projective 3-space.\n\n2. If X has S^2 x R geometry, then the action of D_n on X must preserve the S^2 factor. In this case, the quotient space M = X/D_n is a Seifert fiber space with base orbifold a 2-dimensional sphere with n cone points of order 2. The classification of Seifert fiber spaces then implies that M is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of n copies of S^2 x S^1.\n\n3. If X has SL(2,R) geometry, then the action of D_n on X must preserve the SL(2,R) structure. In this case, the quotient space M = X/D_n is a Seifert fiber space with base orbifold a 2-dimensional hyperbolic orbifold with n cone points of order 2. The classification of Seifert fiber spaces then implies that M is diffeomorphic to a hyperbolic 3-manifold with n cusps.\n\nIn summary, the possible diffeomorphism classes of M are given by the connected sum of n copies of RP^3#RP^3, the connected sum of n copies of S^2 x S^1, or a hyperbolic 3-manifold with n cusps."
