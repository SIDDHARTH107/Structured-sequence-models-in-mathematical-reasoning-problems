    "message_1": "A person wants to construct a rectangular garden with an area of 200 square meters. One side of the garden will be up against a wall, so fencing is only needed for the other three sides. The fencing for the side opposite the wall costs $10 per meter, while the fencing for the other two sides costs $5 per meter. What should the dimensions of the garden be in order to minimize costs?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the side opposite the wall be x meters and the length of the other two sides be y meters each. The area of the rectangular garden is given by:\n\nA = x * y = 200 square meters\n\nWe need to minimize the cost of the fencing. The cost function is given by:\n\nC(x, y) = 10x + 5y + 5y = 10x + 10y\n\nSince we know the area, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 200/x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the cost function:\n\nC(x) = 10x + 10(200/x)\n\nTo minimize the cost function, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of C(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nC'(x) = 10 - (2000/x^2)\n\nSetting C'(x) equal to 0:\n\n10 - (2000/x^2) = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2000/x^2 = 10\n2000 = 10x^2\nx^2 = 200\nx = sqrt(200)\nx ≈ 14.14 meters\n\nNow, find the corresponding value for y:\n\ny = 200/x\ny = 200/14.14\ny ≈ 14.14 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that minimize the cost of fencing are approximately 14.14 meters by 14.14 meters."
