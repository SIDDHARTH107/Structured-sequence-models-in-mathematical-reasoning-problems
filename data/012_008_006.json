    "message_2": "A graph is non-planar if it cannot be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. According to Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K_3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nFor a graph with 6 vertices, the minimum number of edges required to make it non-planar can be determined using Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a planar graph with 6 vertices (V = 6), the maximum number of edges (E) it can have without becoming non-planar can be determined by rearranging Euler's formula:\n\nE = V + F - 2\n\nSince the maximum number of faces (F) in a planar graph with 6 vertices is 12 (a triangulation of the vertices), we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\nE = 6 + 12 - 2\nE = 16\n\nThus, a planar graph with 6 vertices can have at most 16 edges. To make it non-planar, we need to add at least one more edge. Therefore, the minimum number of edges that a non-planar graph with 6 vertices can have is 17."
