Assume that $M$ is equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ given in terms of the local orthonormal frames $e_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$, $e_2 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, and $e_3 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, by the quadratic form\n$$\ng = dx^2 + dy^2 + 4dz^2.\n$$\n\nUsing Cartan's method of moving frames, calculate the Cartan connection of $M$ for the Riemannian metric $g$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection for the given Riemannian metric $g$, we first need to find the dual coframe $\\omega^i$ and the connection 1-forms $\\omega^i_j$. The dual coframe is given by the dual basis of the local orthonormal frame $e_i$.\n\nFrom the given metric, we have\n$$\ng = \\omega^1 \\otimes \\omega^1 + \\omega^2 \\otimes \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 \\otimes \\omega^3,\n$$\nwhere $\\omega^1 = dx$, $\\omega^2 = dy$, and $\\omega^3 = 2dz$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the exterior derivatives of the coframe 1-forms:\n$$\nd\\omega^1 = 0,\n$$\n$$\nd\\omega^2 = 0,\n$$\n$$\nd\\omega^3 = 0.\n$$\n\nNext, we need to find the connection 1-forms $\\omega^i_j$ that satisfy the structure equations:\n$$\nd\\omega^i = -\\omega^i_j \\wedge \\omega^j.\n$$\n\nSince $d\\omega^1 = d\\omega^2 = d\\omega^3 = 0$, the structure equations become:\n$$\n0 = -\\omega^1_j \\wedge \\omega^j,\n$$\n$$\n0 = -\\omega^2_j \\wedge \\omega^j,\n$$\n$$\n0 = -\\omega^3_j \\wedge \\omega^j.\n$$\n\nFrom these equations, we can deduce that the connection 1-forms are all zero:\n$$\n\\omega^1_1 = \\omega^1_2 = \\omega^1_3 = \\omega^2_1 = \\omega^2_2 = \\omega^2_3 = \\omega^3_1 = \\omega^3_2 = \\omega^3_3 = 0.\n$$\n\nThus, the Cartan connection for the given Riemannian metric $g$ is given by the connection 1-forms $\\omega^i_j = 0$ for all $i, j = 1, 2, 3$."
