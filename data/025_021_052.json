Here's a problem:\n\nIn algebraic geometry, mirror symmetry predicts that the number of rational curves of degree $d$ on one side of a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau 3-folds is the same as the number of holomorphic discs of area $d$ on the other side of the mirror.\n\nLet's consider a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau 3-folds. If the number of rational curves of degree 3 on the first side of the mirror is 25, how many holomorphic discs of area 3 are predicted to lie on the mirror partner?",
    "message_2": "Since mirror symmetry predicts that the number of rational curves of degree $d$ on one side of a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau 3-folds is the same as the number of holomorphic discs of area $d$ on the other side of the mirror, we can conclude that if there are 25 rational curves of degree 3 on the first side of the mirror, there will also be 25 holomorphic discs of area 3 on the mirror partner."
