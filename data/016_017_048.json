    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal pattern that can be constructed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The number of line segments in the Heighway Dragon Curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^n - 1\n\nFor the Heighway Dragon Curve of order 5, we have:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31\n\nSo, there are 31 line segments needed to construct the Heighway Dragon Curve of order 5."
