    "message_2": "The injectivity radius of a Riemannian manifold M at a point p is defined as the largest radius r such that the exponential map at p is a diffeomorphism on the open ball of radius r centered at the origin in the tangent space T_pM. In other words, it is the largest radius for which geodesics starting at p do not self-intersect.\n\nIn the case of a hyperbolic 2-dimensional manifold M with constant negative curvature -4, the injectivity radius is closely related to the length of the shortest closed geodesic. This is because a closed geodesic is a curve that is both a geodesic and a loop, and the injectivity radius measures the largest radius for which geodesics do not self-intersect.\n\nSince the shortest closed geodesic on M has length 1, this means that geodesics starting at any point on M can travel a distance of at most 1/2 before they self-intersect. This is because a closed geodesic of length 1 is a loop that can be traversed in both directions, and the injectivity radius is the largest radius for which geodesics do not self-intersect.\n\nTherefore, the injectivity radius of M is 1/2."
