    "message_2": "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that involves drawing multiple samples with replacement from the original sample and calculating the statistic of interest (in this case, the mean) for each resampled sample. The distribution of these resampled statistics is then used to estimate the confidence interval for the true population parameter.\n\nTo determine a 95% confidence interval for the true mean blood pressure of the population using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of resamples (e.g., 1000 or more) with replacement from the original sample of 30 individuals.\n2. Calculate the mean blood pressure for each resampled sample.\n3. Arrange the resampled means in ascending order.\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the resampled means. These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nNote that the actual bootstrapping process requires computational power and programming skills. Here, I will provide a general guideline for the confidence interval based on the information given.\n\nSince we have a sample mean (x̄) of 125 mmHg and a standard deviation (s) of 15 mmHg for a sample size (n) of 30, we can estimate the standard error (SE) using the formula:\n\nSE = s / √n\n\nSE = 15 / √30 ≈ 2.74 mmHg\n\nAssuming a normal distribution of the resampled means, we can use the standard error to estimate the 95% confidence interval. For a 95% confidence interval, the critical value (z) is approximately 1.96.\n\nMargin of Error (ME) = z * SE\n\nME = 1.96 * 2.74 ≈ 5.37 mmHg\n\nNow, we can calculate the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval:\n\nLower Bound = x̄ - ME = 125 - 5.37 ≈ 119.63 mmHg\nUpper Bound = x̄ + ME = 125 + 5.37 ≈ 130.37 mmHg\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean blood pressure of the population using bootstrapping is approximately (119.63, 130.37) mmHg. Keep in mind that this is an approximation based on the assumption of a normal distribution of the resampled means, and the actual bootstrapping process might yield slightly different results."
