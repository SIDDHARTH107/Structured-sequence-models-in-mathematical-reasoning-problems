    "message_1": "A student needs to pack their backpack for a hiking trip. The backpack has a maximum capacity of 20 pounds. The student has 6 items they want to bring, each with a weight:\nItem 1 - 3 pounds\nItem 2 - 5 pounds\nItem 3 - 7 pounds\nItem 4 - 2 pounds\nItem 5 - 4 pounds\nItem 6 - 6 pounds\n\nUsing the Knapsack problem, what is the maximum weight of items the student can bring on their trip, without exceeding the backpack's weight limit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a table with rows representing the items and columns representing the weights from 0 to the maximum capacity of the backpack (20 pounds). The table will be filled with the maximum value that can be obtained by including or excluding items.\n\nHere's the table:\n\nWeights  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nItem 1   0  0  0  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3\nItem 2   0  0  0  3  3  5  5  5  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8\nItem 3   0  0  0  3  3  5  5  7  8  8 10 10 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12\nItem 4   0  0  2  3  3  5  5  7  8  9 10 10 12 12 12 14 14 14 14 14 14\nItem 5   0  0  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 14 15 16 17 18 18\nItem 6   0  0  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\nThe maximum weight of items the student can bring on their trip without exceeding the backpack's weight limit is 20 pounds. This can be achieved by selecting items 1, 4, 5, and 6 (3 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 15)."
