    "message_1": "A 10 kg crate is initially at rest on a frictionless surface. A horizontal force of 50 N is then applied to the crate, moving it a distance of 6 meters. Find the work done by the force using integration. (Assume g = 9.8 m/s^2)",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nSince the force is applied horizontally and the crate moves horizontally, the angle between the force and the displacement is 0 degrees. Therefore, cos(θ) = cos(0) = 1.\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\nWork = 50 N × 6 m × 1\nWork = 300 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 300 Joules. Integration is not necessary in this case, as the force is constant and the angle between the force and displacement is constant as well."
