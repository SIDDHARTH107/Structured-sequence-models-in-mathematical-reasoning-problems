    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).\n\nIn this case, the length is 20 meters and the width is 15 meters. So, we plug in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2(20 + 15)\nPerimeter = 2(35)\nPerimeter = 70 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the field is 70 meters."
