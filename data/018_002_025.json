    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B, we need to show that every element of A ∩ B is also an element of both A and B. By definition, the intersection of two sets, A ∩ B, contains all elements that are common to both sets A and B.\n\nLet's find the elements of A ∩ B:\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of sets A and B, we can see that the common elements are:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4, 6}\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x from A ∩ B and show that it belongs to both A and B.\n\nx ∈ A ∩ B implies that x ∈ A and x ∈ B.\n\nFor x = 2, we can see that 2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ B.\nFor x = 4, we can see that 4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ B.\nFor x = 6, we can see that 6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ B.\n\nSince every element of A ∩ B is also an element of both A and B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B."
