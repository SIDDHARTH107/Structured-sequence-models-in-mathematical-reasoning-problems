    "message_1": "Suppose there are 5 people at a party and each person wants to shake hands with everyone else once. How many total handshakes will occur at the party? Use a recurrence relation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using a recurrence relation, let's denote the number of handshakes for n people as H(n). When a new person joins the party, they shake hands with everyone who is already there. So, if there are n people at the party, the new person will shake hands with n-1 people. Therefore, the recurrence relation can be defined as:\n\nH(n) = H(n-1) + (n-1)\n\nNow, we need to find the base case. When there are 2 people at the party, there is only 1 handshake:\n\nH(2) = 1\n\nUsing the recurrence relation and the base case, we can find the number of handshakes for 5 people:\n\nH(3) = H(2) + (3-1) = 1 + 2 = 3\nH(4) = H(3) + (4-1) = 3 + 3 = 6\nH(5) = H(4) + (5-1) = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nSo, there will be a total of 10 handshakes at the party with 5 people."
