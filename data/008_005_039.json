First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 2  1 -3 |  5 |\n| 4 -5  2 | -8 |\n| 3 -2  1 |  3 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 1.5*R1\n\n|  2   1  -3  |   5  |\n|  0  -7   8  | -18 |\n|  0  -3.5  5.5|  0.5|\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7 and the third row by -3.5 to make the leading coefficients of y equal to 1:\n\nR2 = R2 / -7\nR3 = R3 / -3.5\n\n|  2   1   -3  |   5   |\n|  0   1  -8/7 |  18/7 |\n|  0   1  -11/7| -1/7  |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 - R2\n\n|  2   1   -3  |   5   |\n|  0   1  -8/7 |  18/7 |\n|  0   0   1/7 | -19/7 |\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = (-19/7) / (1/7) = -19\n\ny = (18/7) - (-8/7)*(-19) = 2\n\nx = (5 - 1*y + 3*z) / 2 = 1\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = -19."
