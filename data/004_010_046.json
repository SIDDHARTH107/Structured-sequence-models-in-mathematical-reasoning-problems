Applying the power rule, we get:\n\n(3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\n2) For the second term, 2x, n = 1. Applying the power rule, we get:\n\n(2x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (2x^2)/2 = x^2\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of both terms and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + C"
