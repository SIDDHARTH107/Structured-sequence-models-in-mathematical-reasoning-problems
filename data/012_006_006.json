    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex). In this graph, all vertices have a degree of 2, which is even. Therefore, this graph has an Eulerian path. One possible Eulerian path is A-C-D-B-A.\n\nA Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once. This graph has a Hamiltonian path as well. One possible Hamiltonian path is A-B-D-C."
