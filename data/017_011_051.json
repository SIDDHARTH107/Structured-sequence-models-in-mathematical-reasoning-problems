    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups be n_2 and n_3, respectively. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 6 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}. We will consider the cases for the number of Sylow subgroups and show that G must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Also, P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, G is isomorphic to the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is isomorphic to C4 × C3 = C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4. Since |P_2| = 4, P_2 is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If P_2 is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_3 and P_2, which is isomorphic to D6. If P_2 is isomorphic to V4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_3 and P_2, which is isomorphic to A4.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and the same arguments apply. G will be isomorphic to either D6 or A4.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are no normal Sylow subgroups other than the trivial subgroup and G itself. However, this contradicts the fact that a group of order 12 must have a normal subgroup of order 3 or 4 (by the Sylow theorems). Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, as required. The possible isomorphisms are:\n\n1. G ≅ C12: This isomorphism occurs when G is the direct product of a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup.\n2. G ≅ A4: This isomorphism occurs when G is the semidirect product of a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to V4.\n3. G ≅ D6: This isomorphism occurs when G is the semidirect product of a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to C4."
