    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit of type A is $10 and for type B is $15. The production process takes 2 hours/unit for A and 3 hours/unit for B. The company has 100 hours of labor available each week. What is the maximum profit the company can make per week if it must produce at least 5 units of type A and 10 units of type B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A and y be the number of units of type B.\n\nThe profit function is P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nThe labor constraint is 2x + 3y ≤ 100.\n\nThe minimum production constraints are x ≥ 5 and y ≥ 10.\n\nWe need to maximize the profit function P(x, y) subject to the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region:\n\nx ≥ 5\ny ≥ 10\n2x + 3y ≤ 100\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. (x, y) = (5, 10)\n2x + 3y = 100\n2(5) + 3y = 100\n3y = 90\ny = 30\n(x, y) = (5, 30)\n\n2.
