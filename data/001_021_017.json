    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -3.\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(2)(-3))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √49) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 4\n\nThere are two solutions:\n\n1) x = (-5 + 7) / 4\nx = 2 / 4\nx = 0.50\n\n2) x = (-5 - 7) / 4\nx = -12 / 4\nx = -3.00\n\nSo, the solutions to the nearest hundredth are x = 0.50 and x = -3.00."
