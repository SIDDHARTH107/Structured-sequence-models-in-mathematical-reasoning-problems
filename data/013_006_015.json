    "message_1": "In a Stag Hunt game, two hunters must decide to either hunt a stag or a rabbit. If both hunt the stag, they each get a payoff of 4 units. If one hunts the stag and the other hunts the rabbit, the one who hunts the stag gets a payoff of 2 units, while the one who hunts the rabbit gets a payoff of 1 unit. If both hunt the rabbit, they each get a payoff of 3 units. \n\nAssuming both hunters are rational and attempting to maximize their payoffs, what is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the strategies of both hunters and determine which strategy is the best response to the other hunter's strategy. We can represent the payoffs in a matrix:\n\n```\n          Hunter 2\n          Stag   Rabbit\n         ┌─────┬──────┐\nHunter 1 │(4,4)│(2,1) │\n         ├─────┼──────┤\n         │(1,2)│(3,3) │\n         └─────┴──────┘\n```\n\nThere are two potential Nash equilibria in this game:\n\n1. Both hunters hunt the stag (4,4): In this case, neither hunter has an incentive to deviate from their strategy, as doing so would result in a lower payoff (2 or 1).\n\n2. Both hunters hunt the rabbit (3,3): In this case, neither hunter has an incentive to deviate from their strategy, as doing so would result in a lower payoff (1 or 2).\n\nSo, there are two Nash equilibria in this Stag Hunt game: (Stag, Stag) and (Rabbit, Rabbit)."
