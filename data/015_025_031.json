    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the forced van der Pol oscillator at a particular time t, we need to first write down the equation of motion for the oscillator. The forced van der Pol oscillator is described by the following second-order differential equation:\n\nx''(t) - μ(1 - x^2(t))x'(t) + ω₀²x(t) = F₀cos(ωt)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the oscillator at time t, x'(t) is the velocity, x''(t) is the acceleration, μ is the non-linear damping coefficient, ω₀ is the natural frequency, F₀ is the forcing amplitude, and ω is the forcing frequency.\n\nGiven the values: μ = 2, F₀ = 5, and ω₀ = 3, the equation becomes:\n\nx''(t) - 2(1 - x^2(t))x'(t) + 9x(t) = 5cos(ωt)\n\nTo find the amplitude at a particular time t, we need to solve this equation for x(t). However, solving this equation analytically is not possible due to its non-linear nature. Instead, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solution, such as the Runge-Kutta method or other numerical integration techniques.\n\nOnce we have an approximate solution for x(t), we can find the amplitude at a particular time t by evaluating the function x(t) at that time. Note that the amplitude will depend on the forcing frequency ω and the initial conditions of the oscillator (i.e., its initial position and velocity)."
