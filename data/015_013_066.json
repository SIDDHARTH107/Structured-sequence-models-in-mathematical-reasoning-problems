X(1) = 3.5 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 3.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.875\n2. X(2) = 3.5 * 0.875 * (1 - 0.875) = 3.5 * 0.875 * 0.125 = 0.3828125\n3. X(3) = 3.5 * 0.3828125 * (1 - 0.3828125) = 3.5 * 0.3828125 * 0.6171875 = 0.8266856689453125\n4.

For r = 3.5, the logistic map exhibits chaotic behavior, meaning that the values of X(n) will not settle down to a fixed point or a periodic cycle. Instead, they will continue to change unpredictably as n increases."
