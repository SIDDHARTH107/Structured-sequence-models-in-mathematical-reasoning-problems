    "message_1": "A circle with a radius of 8 cm has a central angle of 75 degrees. What is the area of the sector formed by this central angle?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector formed by the central angle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 8 cm and the central angle is 75 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (75 / 360) × π × 8²\n\nArea of sector = (1/4.8) × π × 64\n\nArea of sector = (1/4.8) × 201.06193 (approximating π as 3.14159)\n\nArea of sector ≈ 41.97165 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the sector formed by the central angle of 75 degrees in a circle with a radius of 8 cm is approximately 41.97 cm²."
