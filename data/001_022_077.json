    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = (x-1)(x+2)(x+4)\n\nThe x-intercepts are the values of x that make this equation true. We can see that there are three x-intercepts:\n\n1. x - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n2. x + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n3. x + 4 = 0 => x = -4\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 1, x = -2, and x = -4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the end behavior of the graph. The end behavior of a polynomial is determined by the degree of the polynomial and the leading coefficient. In this case, the polynomial is:\n\ny = (x-1)(x+2)(x+4)\n\nExpanding the polynomial, we get:\n\ny = x^3 + 5x^2 + 2x - 8\n\nThe degree of the polynomial is 3, which is odd, and the leading coefficient is 1, which is positive. Based on these characteristics, we can determine the end behavior:\n\n1. As x approaches negative infinity (-∞), y approaches positive infinity (+∞).\n2. As x approaches positive infinity (+∞), y approaches negative infinity (-∞).\n\nIn summary, the x-intercepts are x = 1, x = -2, and x = -4, and the end behavior of the graph is:\n\n1. As x → -∞, y → +∞\n2. As x → +∞, y → -∞"
