    "message_2": "To use the Jacobi iterative method, we first need to rewrite the given system of linear equations in the form x = Dx + b, where D is the inverse of the diagonal matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector. We also need to ensure that the system is diagonally dominant.\n\n1. Rewrite the system of equations:\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + y - z = 2\n-x + 2y + z = 3\n3x + 2y - 4z = -7\n\nWe can rewrite this system as:\n\nx = (2 - y + z) / 2\ny = (3 + x - z) / 2\nz = (3x + 2y + 7) / 4\n\n2. Check for diagonal dominance:\n\nFor the system to be diagonally dominant, the absolute value of the diagonal element in each row must be greater than the sum of the absolute values of the other elements in the same row.\n\nFor the first equation: |2| > |1| + |-1| (2 > 2) - Not diagonally dominant\nFor the second equation: |2| > |-1| + |1| (2 > 2) - Not diagonally dominant\nFor the third equation: |-4| > |3| + |2| (4 > 5) - Not diagonally dominant\n\nSince the given system is not diagonally dominant, the Jacobi iterative method may not converge to the correct solution. However, we can still attempt to use the method and see if it converges.\n\n3. Apply the Jacobi iterative method:\n\nLet's start with an initial guess for x, y, and z:\n\nx^(0) = 0\ny^(0) = 0\nz^(0) = 0\n\nNow, we'll use the following iterative formulas:\n\nx^(k+1) = (2 - y^(k) + z^(k)) / 2\ny^(k+1) = (3 + x^(k) - z^(k)) / 2\nz^(k+1) = (3x^(k) + 2y^(k) + 7) / 4\n\nWe'll perform a few iterations to see if the method converges:\n\nIteration 1:\nx^(1) = (2 - 0 + 0) / 2 = 1\ny^(1) = (3 + 0 - 0) / 2 = 1.5\nz^(1) = (3*0 + 2*0 + 7) / 4 = 1.75\n\nIteration 2:\nx^(2) = (2 - 1.5 + 1.75) / 2 = 0.625\ny^(2) = (3 + 1 - 1.75) / 2 = 0.625\nz^(2) = (3*1 + 2*1.5 + 7) / 4 = 2.375\n\nIteration 3:\nx^(3) = (2 - 0.625 + 2.375) / 2 = 0.875\ny^(3) = (3 + 0.625 - 2.375) / 2 = 0.125\nz^(3) = (3*0.625 + 2*0.625 + 7) / 4 = 2.1875\n\nWe can continue iterating until the values of x, y, and z converge to a certain level of accuracy or stop changing significantly. Note that since the system is not diagonally dominant, the Jacobi iterative method may not converge to the correct solution, and another method, such as the Gauss-Seidel method, may be more appropriate."
