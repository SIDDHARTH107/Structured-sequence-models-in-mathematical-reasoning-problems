    "message_1": "In a Centipede game with 5 legs, each player starts with $1. Player 1 has the option to end the game on the first leg for a payout of $10 or to pass the opportunity to Player 2. Player 2 can then end the game on the second leg for a payout of $9 or pass it back to Player 1. This continues on each leg with the payout decreasing by $1 each time until the final leg. How much money does Player 1 receive if both players play rationally?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final leg to determine the rational choices for each player.\n\nAt the 5th leg, the payout is $6. Since Player 1 has the option to end the game, they will do so, as it is more than their initial $1.\n\nAt the 4th leg, the payout is $7. Player 2 knows that if they pass, Player 1 will end the game at the 5th leg and receive $6. Therefore, Player 2 will end the game at the 4th leg and receive $7.\n\nAt the 3rd leg, the payout is $8. Player 1 knows that if they pass, Player 2 will end the game at the 4th leg and receive $7. Since $8 is more than $6 (which Player 1 would receive if they pass), Player 1 will end the game at the 3rd leg and receive $8.\n\nSo, if both players play rationally, Player 1 will receive $8."
