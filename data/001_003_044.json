    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(3)(x + 2y) = (3)(13)\n(1)(3x - 4y) = (1)(-18)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n3x + 6y = 39\n3x - 4y = -18\n\nNow, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(3x + 6y) - (3x - 4y) = 39 - (-18)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n10y = 57\n\nNow, we will solve for y by dividing both sides by 10:\n\ny = 57 / 10\ny = 5.7\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. We will use the first equation:\n\nx + 2(5.7) = 13\n\nx + 11.4 = 13\n\nNow, we will subtract 11.4 from both sides to solve for x:\n\nx = 13 - 11.4\nx = 1.6\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.6 and y = 5.7."
