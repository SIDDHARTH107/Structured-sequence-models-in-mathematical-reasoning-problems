    "message_1": "A school has 500 students, out of which 200 are girls and 300 are boys. If the probability of a student being selected for a science competition is 0.4 for girls and 0.6 for boys, what is the probability that a randomly selected student from the school will be selected for the science competition?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student from the school will be selected for the science competition, we can use the law of total probability. This states that the probability of an event occurring (in this case, being selected for the science competition) is equal to the sum of the probabilities of that event occurring in each of the mutually exclusive scenarios (in this case, being a girl or a boy).\n\nLet G be the event that a student is a girl, B be the event that a student is a boy, and S be the event that a student is selected for the science competition. We want to find P(S), the probability that a randomly selected student will be selected for the science competition.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we have:\n\nP(S) = P(S|G) * P(G) + P(S|B) * P(B)\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(S|G) = 0.4 (probability of being selected for the competition given the student is a girl)\nP(S|B) = 0.6 (probability of being selected for the competition given the student is a boy)\nP(G) = 200/500 (probability of a student being a girl)\nP(B) = 300/500 (probability of a student being a boy)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(S) = (0.4 * (200/500)) + (0.6 * (300/500))\n\nP(S) = (0.4 * 0.4) + (0.6 * 0.6)\n\nP(S) = 0.16 + 0.36\n\nP(S) = 0.52\n\nSo the probability that a randomly selected student from the school will be selected for the science competition is 0.52, or 52%."
