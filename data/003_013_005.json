    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) + 3 within the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π, we need to find the maximum value of the sine function within this interval and then apply the transformation.\n\nThe sine function has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. In the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π, sin(x) achieves its maximum value of 1 at x = π/2.\n\nNow, we can apply the transformation to the sine function:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(x) + 3\n\nAt x = π/2, where sin(x) has its maximum value of 1:\n\nf(π/2) = 2sin(π/2) + 3\nf(π/2) = 2(1) + 3\nf(π/2) = 2 + 3\nf(π/2) = 5\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) + 3 within the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π is 5."
