    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted by A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 3}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of sets {1} and {2}, denoted by {1} x {2}. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in {1} and b is in {2}.\n\n{1} x {2} = {(1, 2)}\n\nNow we can find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and {1} x {2}:\n\n1. (A △ B) △ {1} x {2} = ({1, 3}) △ {(1, 2)}\n\nSince the elements of (A △ B) are not ordered pairs, the symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\n\n(A △ B) △ {1} x {2} = {1, 3, (1, 2)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of B and {1}, denoted by B △ {1}:\n\nB △ {1} = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow we can find the Cartesian product of (B △ {1}) and {2}, denoted by (B △ {1}) x {2}:\n\n(B △ {1}) x {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B △ {1}) x {2}:\n\n2. A △ (B △ {1}) x {2} = {1, 2} △ {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\nSince the elements of A are not ordered pairs, the symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\n\nA △ (B △ {1}) x {2} = {1, 2, (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\nComparing the results of both parts:\n\n1. (A △ B) △ {1} x {2} = {1, 3, (1, 2)}\n\n2.
