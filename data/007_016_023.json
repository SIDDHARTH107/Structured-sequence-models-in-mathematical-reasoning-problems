Let's find the Sophie Germain primes between 1 and 100.\n\n1. 2 is prime, and 2(2) + 1 = 5 is also prime.\n2. 3 is prime, and 2(3) + 1 = 7 is also prime.\n3. 5 is prime, and 2(5) + 1 = 11 is also prime.\n4. 11 is prime, and 2(11) + 1 = 23 is also prime.\n5. 23 is prime, and 2(23) + 1 = 47 is also prime.\n6. 29 is prime, and 2(29) + 1 = 59 is also prime.\n7. 41 is prime, and 2(41) + 1 = 83 is also prime.\n8. 53 is prime, and 2(53) + 1 = 107 is not prime (it's greater than 100, so we don't need to consider it).\n\nThere are 7 Sophie Germain primes between 1 and 100."
