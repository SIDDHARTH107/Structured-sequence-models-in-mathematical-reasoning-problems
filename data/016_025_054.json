    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve construction is a fractal pattern that starts with an equilateral triangle and recursively removes smaller equilateral triangles at each stage. The number of triangles removed at each stage follows a geometric progression.\n\nAt stage 1, there is 1 triangle removed.\nAt stage 2, there are 3 triangles removed (1 from the previous stage and 2 new ones).\nAt stage 3, there are 3^2 = 9 triangles removed, and so on.\n\nThe total number of triangles removed at the nth stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal triangles removed = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^(n-1)\n\nThis is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere a is the first term (1 in this case), r is the common ratio (3), and n is the number of terms (7 for the 7th stage).\n\nSum = 1 * (1 - 3^7) / (1 - 3)\nSum = 1 * (1 - 2187) / (-2)\nSum = (2186) / 2\nSum = 1093\n\nSo, there are a total of 1093 triangles removed in the 7th stage of the Sierpinski sieve construction."
