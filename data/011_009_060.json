    "message_2": "To determine the number of different ways the 5 people can stand in a line for a photograph, we can use the concept of permutations. Since the order matters, we will calculate the number of permutations for 5 objects taken 5 at a time.\n\nThe formula for permutations is:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of objects, r is the number of objects taken at a time, and ! denotes the factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number).\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (total number of people) and r = 5 (since all 5 people must be in the photograph).\n\nP(5, 5) = 5! / (5 - 5)!\n\nP(5, 5) = 5! / 0!\n\nSince 0! is defined as 1, we have:\n\nP(5, 5) = 5! / 1\n\nNow, we calculate the factorial of 5:\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nSo, P(5, 5) = 120 / 1 = 120\n\nThere are 120 different ways the 5 people can stand in a line for a photograph."
