    "message_2": "The Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. Similarly, B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A. Let's find A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the sets in the opposite order:\n\n(B x A) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, both sets are equal:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n(B x A) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nTherefore, the statement that (A x B) U (B x A) is not equal to (B x A) U (A x B) is incorrect. They are equal."
