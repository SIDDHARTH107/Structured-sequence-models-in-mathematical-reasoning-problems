    "message_2": "To determine the degree sequence of the graph G, we need to find the degrees of all the vertices in the graph. Since G is a simple undirected graph, we know that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nLet's denote the degrees of the 7 vertices as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7. Then, we have:\n\nd1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of non-negative integers that satisfy this equation. Since there are 10 edges, at least one vertex must have a degree of 3 or more. Let's assume that d1 = 3. Then, we have:\n\n3 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 20\n\nNow, let's assume that d2 = 3 as well. Then, we have:\n\n3 + 3 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 20\n\nNow, let's assume that d3 = 3. Then, we have:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 20\n\nNow, let's assume that d4 = 3. Then, we have:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 20\n\nNow, let's assume that d5 = 2. Then, we have:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + d6 + d7 = 20\n\nNow, let's assume that d6 = 2. Then, we have:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + d7 = 20\n\nFinally, we have:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + d7 = 20\nd7 = 20 - (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2) = 20 - 16 = 4\n\nSo, the degree sequence of the graph G is (3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4). Note that this is just one possible degree sequence for the given graph, as there can be multiple graphs with 7 vertices and 10 edges."
