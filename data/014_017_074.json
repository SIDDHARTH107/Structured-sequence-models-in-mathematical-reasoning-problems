    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted an encrypted message that was encoded using a Caesar cipher (shift of letters by a specific number of positions). The frequency distribution of the letters in the encrypted message is given as follows:\n\nA: 0.082, B: 0.036, C: 0.028, D: 0.042, E: 0.127, F: 0.022, G: 0.020, H: 0.061, I: 0.070, J: 0.002, K: 0.008, L: 0.040, M: 0.024, N: 0.067, O: 0.075, P: 0.019, Q: 0.001, R: 0.060, S: 0.063, T: 0.091, U: 0.028, V: 0.010, W: 0.024, X: 0.002, Y: 0.020, Z: 0.001\n\nIf you know that the original message was in English and used simple words, determine the shift used by the Caesar cipher used to encrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "To determine the shift used in the Caesar cipher, we can compare the given frequency distribution to the typical frequency distribution of letters in the English language. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D.\n\nIn the given frequency distribution, the most common letters are E (0.127), T (0.091), A (0.082), O (0.075), I (0.070), N (0.067), S (0.063), H (0.061), R (0.060), and D (0.042). This distribution is quite similar to the typical English distribution.\n\nSince the most common letter in English is E and the most common letter in the encrypted message is also E (0.127), it is likely that the shift used in the Caesar cipher is 0. This means that the original message was not shifted at all and the encrypted message is the same as the original message."
