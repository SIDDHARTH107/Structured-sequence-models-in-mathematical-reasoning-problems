    "message_1": "A local coffee shop provides coffee in 3 different sizes: small, medium, and large. The probability that a customer orders small, medium, or large coffee is 0.3, 0.5, and 0.2 respectively. If the price of a small coffee is $2, a medium coffee is $3, and a large coffee is $4, what is the expected value of the price a customer pays for a coffee at this shop?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the price a customer pays for a coffee, we multiply the probability of each coffee size by its respective price and then sum the results.\n\nExpected value = (Probability of small coffee * Price of small coffee) + (Probability of medium coffee * Price of medium coffee) + (Probability of large coffee * Price of large coffee)\n\nExpected value = (0.3 * $2) + (0.5 * $3) + (0.2 * $4)\n\nExpected value = ($0.6) + ($1.5) + ($0.8)\n\nExpected value = $2.9\n\nSo, the expected value of the price a customer pays for a coffee at this shop is $2.9."
