    "message_2": "To solve the given diffusion equation using the finite element method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the spatial domain\n2. Formulate the weak form of the problem\n3. Discretize the weak form\n4. Apply the initial and boundary conditions\n5. Solve the resulting system of equations\n\nStep 1: Discretize the spatial domain\nWe are given a uniform mesh size h=0.1, so we divide the interval [0,1] into 10 equal subintervals. This gives us the following nodes: x_0=0, x_1=0.1, x_2=0.2, ..., x_10=1.\n\nStep 2: Formulate the weak form of the problem\nWe multiply the given PDE by a test function v(x,t) and integrate over the spatial domain:\n\n∫(∂u/∂t * v + ∂^2u/∂x^2 * v) dx = 0\n\nStep 3: Discretize the weak form\nWe approximate the solution u(x,t) using a linear combination of basis functions:\n\nu(x,t) ≈ ∑(U_i(t) * φ_i(x))\n\nwhere U_i(t) are the coefficients to be determined and φ_i(x) are the basis functions. We use the standard hat functions for the basis functions. Then, we substitute this approximation into the weak form and apply the Galerkin method:\n\n∫(∑(∂U_i/∂t * φ_i) * v + ∑(∂^2φ_i/∂x^2 * U_i) * v) dx = 0\n\nStep 4: Apply the initial and boundary conditions\nWe are given the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(πx) and the boundary conditions u(0,t) = 0 and u(1,t) = 0. We apply these conditions to our approximation:\n\nU_i(0) = sin(πx_i) for i=1,...,9\nU_0(t) = 0\nU_10(t) = 0\n\nStep 5: Solve the resulting system of equations\nWe now have a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the coefficients U_i(t). We can solve this system using a time-stepping method, such as the implicit Euler method, with a given time step k=0.05:\n\nU_i^(n+1) = U_i^n + k * (∑(A_ij * U_j^(n+1)))\n\nwhere A_ij are the entries of the stiffness matrix, which can be computed from the basis functions and their derivatives. We can solve this linear system of equations for U_i^(n+1) at each time step and obtain the approximate solution u(x,t) at the nodes of our mesh.\n\nIn summary, we have discretized the given diffusion equation using the finite element method with a uniform mesh and applied the initial and boundary conditions. We then solved the resulting system of ODEs using a time-stepping method to obtain the approximate solution u(x,t) on the interval [0,1] and for t in the range [0,1]."
