    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset of 100 students who took a math exam and their scores are in the range of 40 to 100. Your task is to perform a discriminant analysis on this dataset to predict whether a student will pass or fail the exam based on their scores. Using the discriminant function:\n\n$D = -2.2 + 0.05X$\n\nwhere X is the student's exam score, determine the cutoff score for passing the exam (i.e., the value of X for which D = 0).",
    "message_2": "To find the cutoff score for passing the exam, we need to find the value of X for which D = 0. We can do this by setting D equal to 0 and solving for X in the discriminant function:\n\n$0 = -2.2 + 0.05X$\n\nNow, we'll isolate X by adding 2.2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$2.2 = 0.05X$\n\nNext, we'll divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for X:\n\n$X = \\frac{2.2}{0.05}$\n\n$X = 44$\n\nSo, the cutoff score for passing the exam is 44. Students with a score of 44 or higher will pass the exam, while those with a score below 44 will fail."
