    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate connected components.\n\nLet's consider the minimum number of vertices in each connected component after disconnecting the graph. The smallest possible connected component has 1 vertex, and the other connected component would have the remaining 8 vertices.\n\nIn a connected graph, the number of edges E must be at least one less than the number of vertices V (E â‰¥ V - 1). This is because each vertex must be connected to at least one other vertex, and we need at least V - 1 edges to connect all vertices.\n\nIn the connected component with 8 vertices, the minimum number of edges required to keep it connected is 8 - 1 = 7 edges.\n\nNow, let's see how many edges we need to remove from the original graph G to achieve this configuration. G has 12 edges, and we want to leave 7 edges in the connected component with 8 vertices. Therefore, we need to remove 12 - 7 = 5 edges to disconnect the graph G.\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed in order to disconnect G is 5."
