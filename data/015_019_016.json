    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, which is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2 y - 1/3 y^3\n\nHere, (x, y) are the position coordinates, and (p_x, p_y) are the corresponding momentum coordinates. The energy of the system is given by H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = E, where E is a constant.\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Hénon-Heiles system when the energy is equal to 1/6, we need to numerically integrate the equations of motion and compute the Lyapunov exponent from the time evolution of the system.\n\nThe equations of motion for the Hénon-Heiles system are given by:\n\ndx/dt = ∂H/∂p_x = p_x\ndy/dt = ∂H/∂p_y = p_y\ndp_x/dt = -∂H/∂x = -x - 2xy\ndp_y/dt = -∂H/∂y = -y - x^2 + y^2\n\nTo compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to linearize these equations around a reference trajectory and solve the resulting variational equations. This process involves calculating the Jacobian matrix of the system and its eigenvalues.\n\nHowever, finding the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a specific energy value, such as E = 1/6, requires numerical simulations and is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response. It is recommended to use specialized software or numerical libraries to perform this task."
