    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 8 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (8^3)\nV = (4/3) * π * 512\nV = (4 * 512 * π) / 3\nV ≈ 2,048 * π / 3\nV ≈ 2,144.66 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 8 cm is approximately 2,144.66 cubic centimeters."
