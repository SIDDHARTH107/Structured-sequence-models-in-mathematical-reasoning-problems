If a random employee is selected, what is the probability that he/she is not an engineer or computer scientist, given that the employee is not a mathematician either? Assume that every employee belongs to exactly one of the three categories (engineer, computer scientist, or mathematician).",
    "message_2": "Let's first find out how many mathematicians are in the company. Since every employee belongs to exactly one of the three categories, we can find the number of mathematicians by subtracting the number of engineers and computer scientists from the total number of employees:\n\n50 employees - 37 engineers/computer scientists = 13 mathematicians\n\nNow, we know that the employee selected is not a mathematician, so we can consider only the remaining employees:\n\n50 employees - 13 mathematicians = 37 employees (engineers and computer scientists)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that the employee is not an engineer or computer scientist, we are looking for the probability that the employee is a mathematician. However, we are given that the employee is not a mathematician, which means the probability of selecting an employee who is not an engineer or computer scientist, given that the employee is not a mathematician, is 0."
