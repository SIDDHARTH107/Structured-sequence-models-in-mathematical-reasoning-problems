    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 cm and one leg measures 6 cm. What is the measure of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Let's denote the length of the unknown leg as 'a' and the given leg as 'b' (6 cm), and the hypotenuse as 'c' (10 cm). The Pythagorean theorem can be written as:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe know the values of b and c, so we can plug them into the equation:\n\na^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\n\na^2 + 36 = 100\n\nNow, we need to solve for 'a':\n\na^2 = 100 - 36\na^2 = 64\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\na = âˆš64\na = 8\n\nSo, the measure of the other leg is 8 cm."
