    "message_1": "Given the propositions P: \"It rains today\" and Q: \"You bring your umbrella\", form the negation of the compound proposition \"If it rains today, then you bring your umbrella\" and express it in symbolic form using logical operators.",
    "message_2": "The compound proposition \"If it rains today, then you bring your umbrella\" can be represented as an implication: P → Q. The negation of this implication is ¬(P → Q).\n\nUsing the equivalence between an implication and its disjunction form, we can rewrite the negation as follows:\n\n¬(P → Q) ≡ ¬(¬P ∨ Q) ≡ P ∧ ¬Q\n\nSo, the negation of the compound proposition is \"It rains today and you do not bring your umbrella\", which is symbolically represented as P ∧ ¬Q."
