    "message_1": "A student is standing 35 meters away from the base of a building. If the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 52 degrees, calculate the height of the building to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 52 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the base of the building, which is 35 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(52°) = height / 35\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 35:\n\nheight = 35 * tan(52°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 52 degrees and then multiply it by 35:\n\nheight ≈ 35 * 1.2799\nheight ≈ 44.7965\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 45 meters."
