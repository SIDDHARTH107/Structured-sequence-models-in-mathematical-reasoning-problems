    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nIn this case, $p=7$ and $a=3$. Since $3$ is not divisible by $7$, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n$3^{7-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n\n$3^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n\nNow, we can calculate $3^6$ and then find its remainder when divided by $7$:\n\n$3^6 = 729$\n\n$729 \\div 7 = 104$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\nSo, $3^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$."
