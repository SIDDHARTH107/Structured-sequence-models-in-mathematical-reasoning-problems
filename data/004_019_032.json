    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car after 8 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity\nu = initial velocity (0 m/s since the car is at rest)\na = acceleration (5 m/s²)\nt = time (8 seconds)\n\nv = 0 + (5 × 8)\n\nv = 0 + 40\n\nv = 40 m/s\n\nThe velocity of the car after 8 seconds is 40 meters per second."
