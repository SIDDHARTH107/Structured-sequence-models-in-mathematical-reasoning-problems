    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function y = 3sin(2x + π/4), we need to analyze the coefficients and constants in the equation.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the variable x inside the sine function. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of x. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π) / |2| = π.\n\nThus, the amplitude of the function y = 3sin(2x + π/4) is 3, and the period is π."
