    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 2 units of raw material and 3 units of labor, while the production of Product B requires 4 units of raw material and 1 unit of labor. The raw material and labor available for the factory are 20 and 15 units, respectively. The profit per unit of product A and product B are $5 and $6, respectively. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the factory can make? (Hint: Use quadratic programming to solve this problem.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 6y, subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 20 (raw material constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 15 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nFirst, we can simplify the constraints:\nx + 2y ≤ 10\n3x + y ≤ 15\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + 2y = 10\ny = (10 - x) / 2\n\n2. 3x + y = 15\ny = 15 - 3x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 5), (3, 3.5), and (5, 0). We can now evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 6(0) = $0\nP(0, 5) = 5(0) + 6(5) = $30\nP(3, 3.5) = 5(3) + 6(3.5) = $31.5\nP(5, 0) = 5(5) + 6(0) = $25\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (3, 3.5), where the factory produces 3 units of Product A and 3.5 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $31.5."
