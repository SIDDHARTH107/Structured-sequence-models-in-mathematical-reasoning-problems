    "message_2": "The length of the Heighway dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial segment length * (2^n) * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nFor the 10th iteration with an initial segment length of 1, the formula becomes:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^10) * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nLength = 1 * 1024 * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nLength = 1024 * (1.41421356/2)\n\nLength = 1024 * 0.70710678\n\nLength â‰ˆ 724.077\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 10th iteration with an initial segment length of 1 is approximately 724.077 units."
