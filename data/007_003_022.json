    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 748 is divided by 17 using modular arithmetic, we can use the modulo operation:\n\n748 ≡ x (mod 17)\n\nTo find x, we can divide 748 by 17 and find the remainder:\n\n748 ÷ 17 = 44 with a remainder of 4\n\nSo, 748 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n\nThe remainder when 748 is divided by 17 is 4."
