    "message_1": "A principal wants to hire an agent to perform a task, but the agent's effort level is not directly observable by the principal. The agent has two effort levels available: high effort (H) and low effort (L). The value of the task for the principal when the agent exerts high effort is 10, whereas if the agent exerts low effort, the value is only 5. The agent prefers not to exert effort, but dislikes being monitored. If the principal monitors the agent, the agent receives a payoff of 4, regardless of the effort level. If the principal does not monitor, the agent receives a payoff of 6 for low effort and 16 for high effort. What should the principal do to ensure the highest payoff for themselves?",
    "message_2": "To ensure the highest payoff for the principal, we need to analyze the possible scenarios and compare the payoffs for the principal in each case. There are two main decisions the principal can make: to monitor or not to monitor the agent.\n\n1. If the principal monitors the agent:\nIn this case, the agent receives a payoff of 4, regardless of the effort level. Since the agent prefers not to exert effort, they will choose low effort (L) to minimize their effort while still receiving the same payoff. The value of the task for the principal in this case is 5.\n\n2. If the principal does not monitor the agent:\nIn this case, the agent has two choices: high effort (H) with a payoff of 16 or low effort (L) with a payoff of 6. The agent will choose high effort (H) since it provides a higher payoff. The value of the task for the principal in this case is 10.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the principal should choose not to monitor the agent to ensure the highest payoff for themselves. This results in a value of 10 for the principal, as the agent will choose high effort (H) to maximize their own payoff."
