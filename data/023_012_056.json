    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 2x + 1 over the interval [-1, 1] with a jump discontinuity at x = 0, we first need to determine the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is not periodic, we will use the half-range sine and cosine series to represent the function.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ(a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere L is half of the period, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, the function is defined over the interval [-1, 1], so L = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. They are given by the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * cos(0) dx) from -L to L\na_n = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx) from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx) from -L to L\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/1) * ∫(2x + 1) dx from -1 to 1\na_0 = [x^2 + x] from -1 to 1\na_0 = (1 + 1) - ((-1)^2 - 1)\na_0 = 2 - 0\na_0 = 2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/1) * ∫(2x + 1) * cos(nπx) dx from -1 to 1\n\nSince the function is odd and cos(nπx) is even, their product will be odd. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫(2x + 1) * sin(nπx) dx from -1 to 1\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = 2x + 1, dv = sin(nπx) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = -(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx)\n\n∫(2x + 1) * sin(nπx) dx = (2x + 1) * (-1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) - ∫(-1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) * 2 dx\n= (-2x/(nπ) - 1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) + (2/(n^2π^2)) * sin(nπx)\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral from -1 to 1:\n\nb_n = [(-2x/(nπ) - 1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) + (2/(n^2π^2)) * sin(nπx)] from -1 to 1\nb_n = [(-2/(nπ) - 1/(nπ)) * cos(nπ) + (2/(n^2π^2)) * sin(nπ)] - [(-2/(nπ) + 1/(nπ)) * cos(-nπ) + (2/(n^2π^2)) * sin(-nπ)]\nb_n = (-4/(nπ)) * (-1)^n\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = 2 + Σ((-4/(nπ)) * (-1)^n * sin(nπx))\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = 2x + 1 over the interval [-1, 1] with a jump discontinuity at x = 0."
