    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the mean GPA of all students at the university using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000) from the original sample of 50 students with replacement. This means that each bootstrap sample will also have 50 students, but some students may be selected more than once, and some may not be selected at all.\n\n2. Calculate the mean GPA for each bootstrap sample.\n\n3. Arrange the calculated means in ascending order.\n\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap means. These percentiles will give you the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original sample data\nsample_size = 50\nmean_gpa = 3.2\nstd_dev = 0.5\n\n# Generate the original sample\nnp.random.seed(42)\noriginal_sample = np.random.normal(mean_gpa, std_dev, sample_size)\n\n# Bootstrap settings\nbootstrap_samples = 1000\n\n# Perform bootstrapping\nbootstrap_means = []\nfor _ in range(bootstrap_samples):\n    bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(original_sample, sample_size, replace=True)\n    bootstrap_mean = np.mean(bootstrap_sample)\n    bootstrap_means.append(bootstrap_mean)\n\n# Calculate the 95% confidence interval\nlower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)\nupper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)\n\nprint(f\"The 95% confidence interval for the mean GPA of all students at the university is ({lower_bound:.2f}, {upper_bound:.2f})\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the 95% confidence interval for the mean GPA of all students at the university using bootstrapping. Note that the interval may vary slightly due to the random nature of the bootstrap sampling."
