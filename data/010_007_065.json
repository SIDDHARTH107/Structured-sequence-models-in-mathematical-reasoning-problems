    "message_2": "A double-sheeted covering space corresponds to a subgroup of index 2 in the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, x)$. Since $\\pi_1(X, x) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$, we need to find the number of subgroups of index 2 in this group.\n\nThe group $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$ has 6 elements: $(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)$. We can see that there are two subgroups of index 2:\n\n1. $H_1 = \\{(0, 0), (1, 0)\\}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n2. $H_2 = \\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)\\}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nThus, there are 2 double-sheeted covering spaces of $X$ up to covering space isomorphism."
