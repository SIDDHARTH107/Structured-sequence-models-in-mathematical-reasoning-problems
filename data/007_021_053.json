    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an algorithm for finding the non-trivial factors of a composite number. Here, we will use it to find the smallest prime factor of 893.\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is the number we want to factor (in this case, n = 893).\n\n2. Initialize two variables x and y with some initial values, usually 2. So, x = 2 and y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n   a. Update x: x = f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 893\n   b. Update y: y = f(f(y)) = (y^2 + 1)^2 + 1 mod 893 (applying the function twice)\n   c. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n: d = GCD(|x - y|, 893)\n\n4. If d is not 1 and not equal to n, then d is a non-trivial factor of n.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = (2^2 + 1) mod 893 = 5\ny = ((2^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 893 = 26\nd = GCD(|5 - 26|, 893) = GCD(21, 893) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = (5^2 + 1) mod 893 = 26\ny = ((26^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 893 = 677\nd = GCD(|26 - 677|, 893) = GCD(651, 893) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = (26^2 + 1) mod 893 = 677\ny = ((677^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 893 = 5\nd = GCD(|677 - 5|, 893) = GCD(672, 893) = 19\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, d = 19. Since 19 is a prime number, it is the smallest prime factor of 893."
