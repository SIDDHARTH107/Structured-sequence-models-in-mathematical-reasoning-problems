    "message_2": "To find the genus of a non-singular cubic curve in the complex projective plane, we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In this case, the given equation is a cubic curve, so $d = 3$. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the genus of the non-singular cubic curve defined by the equation $y^2z = x^3 - 3x^2z + 2z^3$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$ is 1."
