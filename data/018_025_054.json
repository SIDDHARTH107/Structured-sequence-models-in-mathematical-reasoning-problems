    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. This is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A Δ B) and B, denoted as (A Δ B) ∩ B. This is the set of elements that are in both (A Δ B) and B.\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ B = {}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A. This is the set of elements that are in either B or A, but not in both.\n\nB Δ A = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (B Δ A) and A, denoted as (B Δ A) ∩ A. This is the set of elements that are in both (B Δ A) and A.\n\n(B Δ A) ∩ A = {}\n\nSince both (A Δ B) ∩ B and (B Δ A) ∩ A result in the empty set, they are equal. However, this does not prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection, as the result in this case is equal. The symmetric difference itself is commutative, as A Δ B = B Δ A, but this problem does not provide evidence for or against commutativity with respect to intersection."
