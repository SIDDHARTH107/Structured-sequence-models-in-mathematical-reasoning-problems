    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x^2 + 7x + 12, we need to find two binomials that multiply to give the original polynomial. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to 12 (the constant term) and add up to 7 (the coefficient of the linear term).\n\nThe two numbers that meet these conditions are 3 and 4, since 3 * 4 = 12 and 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nSo, the factored form of the quadratic polynomial is:\n\n(x + 3)(x + 4)"
