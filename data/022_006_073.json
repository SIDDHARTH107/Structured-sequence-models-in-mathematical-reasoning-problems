    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of the function $f(z)$ in the closed unit disk, we will first simplify the function and then apply the Maximum Modulus Principle.\n\nLet's simplify the function $f(z)$:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1}$\n\nWe can perform long division or use the fact that $z^2 + 2z + 2 = (z + 1)^2 - 1$ to simplify the function:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z + 1)^2 - 1}{z + 1} = \\frac{(z + 1 - 1)(z + 1 + 1)}{z + 1} = z + 1$\n\nNow, we have the simplified function $f(z) = z + 1$. We want to find the maximum and minimum modulus of this function in the closed unit disk $|z| \\leq 1$.\n\nFor $z = x + yi$ with $|z| \\leq 1$, we have:\n\n$|f(z)| = |z + 1| = |(x + 1) + yi| = \\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2}$\n\nNow, we will apply the Maximum Modulus Principle. According to this principle, the maximum and minimum modulus of a holomorphic function in a closed and bounded region occur on the boundary of the region. In this case, the boundary is the unit circle $|z| = 1$.\n\nOn the unit circle, we have $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Thus, we want to find the maximum and minimum of:\n\n$|(x + 1)^2 + y^2| = |x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2| = |(x^2 + y^2) + 2x + 1| = |1 + 2x + 1| = |2x + 2|$\n\nThe maximum and minimum modulus of $|2x + 2|$ occur when $x$ takes its extreme values in the interval $[-1, 1]$. These extreme values are $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.\n\nFor $x = -1$, we have:\n\n$|2x + 2| = |-2 + 2| = 0$\n\nFor $x = 1$, we have:\n\n$|2x + 2| = |2 + 2| = 4$\n\nTherefore, the maximum modulus of the function $f(z)$ in the closed unit disk is $4$, and the minimum modulus is $0$."
