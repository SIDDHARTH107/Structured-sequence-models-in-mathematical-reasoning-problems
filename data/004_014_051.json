    "message_2": "To find the volume of the remaining solid, we first need to find the volume of the smaller cylinder that was created by the intersection. \n\nLet R be the radius of the smaller cylinder. Since the height of the smaller cylinder is 4 cm, and the height of the original cylinder is 10 cm, we can use similar triangles to find the radius of the smaller cylinder. The ratio of the heights is 4:10, which simplifies to 2:5. Therefore, the ratio of the radii is also 2:5.\n\nR / 4 = 2 / 5\nR = (2 * 4) / 5\nR = 8 / 5\n\nNow that we have the radius of the smaller cylinder, we can find its volume using the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\nV_small = π * R^2 * h\nV_small = π * (8/5)^2 * 4\nV_small = (64π * 4) / 25\nV_small = 256π / 25\n\nNow we can find the volume of the original cylinder:\n\nV_original = π * r^2 * h\nV_original = π * 4^2 * 10\nV_original = 160π\n\nFinally, we can find the volume of the remaining solid by subtracting the volume of the smaller cylinder from the volume of the original cylinder:\n\nV_remaining = V_original - V_small\nV_remaining = 160π - (256π / 25)\nV_remaining = (4000π - 256π) / 25\nV_remaining = (3744π) / 25\n\nSo, the volume of the remaining solid is (3744π) / 25 cubic centimeters."
