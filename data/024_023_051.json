    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a 2-dimensional manifold represented by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + 2z^2 - 4 = 0$. Determine the symmetry group of $M$ and calculate the order of each element in the group.",
    "message_2": "The given equation represents an ellipsoid in 3-dimensional space. To determine the symmetry group of $M$, we need to find all the transformations that preserve the shape of the ellipsoid.\n\nThe symmetry group of an ellipsoid is the orthogonal group O(3), which consists of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 (rotations) and -1 (reflections). The order of an element in the group is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the element raised to the power of $n$ is equal to the identity element.\n\nFor the given ellipsoid, the symmetry group is O(3). The elements of O(3) can be classified into the following types:\n\n1. Identity element: The 3x3 identity matrix. The order of the identity element is 1.\n\n2. Rotations: These are 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. The order of a rotation is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the rotation matrix raised to the power of $n$ is equal to the identity matrix. The order of a rotation depends on the rotation angle and can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or any other positive integer.\n\n3. Reflections: These are 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant -1. The order of a reflection is 2, as the reflection matrix squared is equal to the identity matrix.\n\nIn summary, the symmetry group of the given ellipsoid is O(3), and the order of each element in the group depends on the type of the element: 1 for the identity element, 2 for reflections, and a positive integer for rotations, depending on the rotation angle."
