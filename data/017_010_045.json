If neither of these cases hold, prove that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 = 1. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is of order 5, which is prime, P is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Let g be a generator of P, so the order of g is 5.\n\nNow, consider the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2. By the Sylow theorems, n_2 must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5. \n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nLet Q be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Since Q is of order 2, it is isomorphic to C2. Let h be the generator of Q, so the order of h is 2. Since P and Q are both normal in G (as they are the unique Sylow subgroups), we have that PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have that PQ is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C5 Ã— C2. This direct product is isomorphic to C10, the cyclic group of order 10. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C10.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5\nIn this case, there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups. Let h be an element of order 2 in G. Since the order of g is 5 and the order of h is 2, and these orders are coprime, we have that the order of gh is 10. Thus, G has an element of order 10, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10. Therefore, there is no need to consider the possibility of G being isomorphic to the dihedral group D5 or a non-abelian group of order 10, as G must be isomorphic to C10."
