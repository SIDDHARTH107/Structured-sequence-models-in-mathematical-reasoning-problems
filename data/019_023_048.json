    "message_1": "Suppose there are 20 marbles in a jar, 6 of which are red and 14 of which are blue. If a person reaches in and pulls out 5 marbles without replacement, what is the probability that exactly 2 of the marbles pulled out are red?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of exactly 2 red marbles being pulled out, we can use the formula for combinations and probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 5 marbles out of 20:\n\nTotal number of outcomes = C(20, 5) = 20! / (5! * (20-5)!) = 15,504\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose exactly 2 red marbles and 3 blue marbles:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 red marbles = C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15\nNumber of ways to choose 3 blue marbles = C(14, 3) = 14! / (3! * (14-3)!) = 364\n\nNow, we can find the number of favorable outcomes by multiplying the number of ways to choose 2 red marbles and 3 blue marbles:\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes = 15 * 364 = 5,460\n\nFinally, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) = 5,460 / 15,504 â‰ˆ 0.3522\n\nSo, the probability of exactly 2 of the marbles pulled out being red is approximately 0.3522 or 35.22%."
