The distances between the cities (in km) are:\n\n- A to B: 500 km\n- A to C: 650 km\n- A to D: 800 km\n- B to C: 300 km\n- B to D: 400 km\n- C to D: 250 km\n\nThe company has several transportation options available with varying costs per kilometer:\n\n- Truck A: $1.20 per km \n- Truck B: $0.80 per km\n- Train: $0.50 per km \n\nThe company wants to minimize the transportation cost while ensuring that all stores receive the required goods. The stores require the following number of products: \n\n- Store B: 250 units\n- Store C: 350 units\n- Store D: 450 units\n\nWhat is the optimal transportation plan and associated cost for the company?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the transportation cost, the company should use the cheapest transportation option, which is the train at $0.50 per km. \n\nThe optimal transportation plan would be to transport the goods directly from city A to each of the stores in cities B, C, and D using the train. The associated cost for each route would be:\n\n- A to B: 500 km * $0.50 per km = $250\n- A to C: 650 km * $0.50 per km = $325\n- A to D: 800 km * $0.50 per km = $400\n\nThe total transportation cost for this plan would be $250 + $325 + $400 = $975."
