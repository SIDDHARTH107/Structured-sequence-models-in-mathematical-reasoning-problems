    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. In the initial construction, there are 2 line segments. After each iteration, the number of line segments is multiplied by 2.\n\nTo find the total number of line segments after the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal line segments = Initial line segments × (2 ^ Number of iterations)\n\nTotal line segments = 2 × (2 ^ 6)\n\nTotal line segments = 2 × 64\n\nTotal line segments = 128\n\nSo, there are 128 line segments after the 6th iteration of constructing the Cantor set."
