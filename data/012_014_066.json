If so, provide a graph isomorphism between them.",
    "message_2": "Yes, Graph A and Graph B are isomorphic. \n\nA graph isomorphism between them can be defined as follows:\n\n1 -> a\n2 -> b\n3 -> c\n4 -> d\n5 -> e\n6 -> f\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency of vertices in both graphs, which means that if two vertices are connected by an edge in Graph A, their corresponding vertices in Graph B are also connected by an edge, and vice versa."
