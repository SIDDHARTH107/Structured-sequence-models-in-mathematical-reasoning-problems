    "message_1": "In a game of Cheap Talk, player A has three potential messages to communicate to player B, and each message is equally likely to be truthful or deceptive. If player B can correctly identify whether player A's message is truthful or deceptive, they receive a payoff of 4. If player B incorrectly identifies a message as truthful when it is actually deceptive or vice versa, they receive a payoff of -1. What is the expected payoff for player B in this game?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected payoff for player B, we need to consider the probabilities of each outcome (correctly identifying a message as truthful or deceptive, and incorrectly identifying a message as truthful or deceptive) and the payoffs associated with each outcome.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes for each message: truthful or deceptive. Since each message is equally likely to be truthful or deceptive, the probability of each outcome is 1/2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoff for player B:\n\nExpected payoff = (Probability of correctly identifying a message as truthful or deceptive * Payoff for correct identification) + (Probability of incorrectly identifying a message as truthful or deceptive * Payoff for incorrect identification)\n\nExpected payoff = (1/2 * 4) + (1/2 * -1)\n\nExpected payoff = (2) + (-0.5)\n\nExpected payoff = 1.5\n\nSo, the expected payoff for player B in this game is 1.5."
