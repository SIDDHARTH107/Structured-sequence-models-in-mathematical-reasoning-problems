    "message_2": "Let's break down the given statement:\n\n∀P (P(0) ∧ (∀n (P(n) → P(n + 1)))) → (∀n P(n))\n\nThis statement says that for any property P, if P holds for 0 and if P holds for any number n implies that P holds for n+1, then P holds for all numbers n.\n\nNow, let's consider P to be the set of all positive even numbers. We need to check if the given statement is true or false for this particular P.\n\n1. P(0): 0 is an even number, so P(0) is true.\n\n2. ∀n (P(n) → P(n + 1)): This part of the statement says that if P holds for any number n, then P should also hold for n+1. However, this is not true for the set of positive even numbers. If n is an even number, then n+1 will be an odd number, and P(n+1) will be false. Therefore, this part of the statement is false.\n\nSince the second part of the statement is false, the overall statement:\n\n∀P (P(0) ∧ (∀n (P(n) → P(n + 1)))) → (∀n P(n))\n\nis false for P being the set of all positive even numbers. So, the truth value of the statement is False."
