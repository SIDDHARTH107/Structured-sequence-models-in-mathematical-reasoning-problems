    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,7), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the surface equation.\n\nGiven the surface equation: z = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy\n\nWe have the following partial derivatives:\n\n∂z/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y\n∂z/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x\n\nNow, let's find the second order partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 6x\n∂²z/∂y² = 6y\n∂²z/∂x∂y = -3\n\nNow, we can find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 = 1 + (3x^2 - 3y)^2\nF = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y) = (3x^2 - 3y)(3y^2 - 3x)\nG = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2 = 1 + (3y^2 - 3x)^2\n\nAnd the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = ∂²z/∂x² = 6x\nM = ∂²z/∂x∂y = -3\nN = ∂²z/∂y² = 6y\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H using the formula:\n\nH = (1/2) * (EN + GL - 2FM) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,7), we have:\n\nE = 1 + (3(1)^2 - 3(1))^2 = 1\nF = (3(1)^2 - 3(1))(3(1)^2 - 3(1)) = 0\nG = 1 + (3(1)^2 - 3(1))^2 = 1\n\nL = 6(1) = 6\nM = -3\nN = 6(1) = 6\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for H:\n\nH = (1/2) * (6 + 6 - 2(0)) / (1 - 0^2) = (1/2) * 12 = 6\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,7) is 6."
