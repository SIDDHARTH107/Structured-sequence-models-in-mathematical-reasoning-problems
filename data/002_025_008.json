    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of the two congruent sides are 9 cm each and the length of the base is 12 cm. What is the length of the altitude drawn from the apex to the base of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the isosceles triangle as ABC, where A is the apex and B and C are the base vertices. Let D be the point on the base BC such that AD is the altitude of the triangle. Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude will bisect the base, so BD = DC = 6 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle ABD:\n\nAD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2\n\nLet AD = h (the altitude we want to find). Then,\n\nh^2 + 6^2 = 9^2\nh^2 + 36 = 81\nh^2 = 81 - 36\nh^2 = 45\nh = √45\nh = 3√5\n\nSo, the length of the altitude drawn from the apex to the base of the triangle is 3√5 cm."
