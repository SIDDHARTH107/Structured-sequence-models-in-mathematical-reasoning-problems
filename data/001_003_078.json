    "message_2": "First, we'll solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 10 - y\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n2(10 - y) - y = 4\n\nNow, we'll solve for y:\n\n20 - 2y - y = 4\n20 - 3y = 4\n-3y = -16\ny = 16/3\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 10 - (16/3)\nx = (30 - 16) / 3\nx = 14/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 14/3 and y = 16/3."
