    "message_2": "To compute the degree of L, we first need to understand the intersection theory on the projective surface X. Let's recall the definition of the degree of a line bundle L on a projective surface X:\n\nDegree of L = L.C, where C is a curve on X, and L.C denotes the intersection number of L and C.\n\nNow, let's find a suitable curve C on X to compute the degree of L. Since X is given by the equation X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 = 0, we can consider the curve C defined by the equation X + Y + Z = 0. This curve is a line in P^2, and it intersects X at three points, which are the solutions of the system of equations:\n\nX^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 = 0\nX + Y + Z = 0\n\nBy substituting Z = -(X + Y) into the first equation, we get:\n\nX^3 + Y^3 - (X + Y)^3 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain:\n\n3X^2Y + 3XY^2 = 0\n\nThis equation factors as:\n\n3XY(X + Y) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\n1) X = 0, Y = 1, Z = -1, which corresponds to the point (0:1:-1)\n2) X = 1, Y = 0, Z = -1, which corresponds to the point (1:0:-1)\n3) X = -1, Y = 1, Z = 0, which corresponds to the point (-1:1:0)\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection number L.C. The divisor D is given by [(1:0:-1)] - [(−1:1:0)], so the line bundle L is associated to the linear equivalence class of this divisor. We can write the divisor D as the difference of two effective divisors:\n\nD = [(1:0:-1)] - [(−1:1:0)]\n\nThe intersection number L.C is the difference of the intersection numbers of these two effective divisors with the curve C:\n\nL.C = ([(1:0:-1)].C) - ([(−1:1:0)].C)\n\nSince the curve C is given by the equation X + Y + Z = 0, it passes through the points (1:0:-1) and (-1:1:0). Therefore, the intersection numbers of these points with C are both 1:\n\n([(1:0:-1)].C) = 1\n([(−1:1:0)].C) = 1\n\nThus, the degree of L is:\n\nDegree of L = L.C = 1 - 1 = 0"
