    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nThe boundary and initial conditions for this problem are:\n\nT(0,t) = 100°C, T(1,t) = 0°C, and T(x,0) = 0°C for 0 < x < 1.\n\nWe will use the Fourier transform to solve this problem. First, we will find the Fourier sine series of the initial temperature distribution:\n\nT(x,0) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[T(x,0) * sin(nπx/L)] dx, with L = 1 meter.\n\nSince T(x,0) = 0 for 0 < x < 1, all B_n coefficients will be zero.\n\nNow, we will find the solution of the heat equation in the form of a Fourier sine series:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ [b_n(t) * sin(nπx)]\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nΣ [∂b_n(t) / ∂t * sin(nπx)] = α Σ [-n²π²b_n(t) * sin(nπx)]\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(nπx), we get:\n\n∂b_n(t) / ∂t = -αn²π²b_n(t)\n\nSolving this first-order ordinary differential equation for b_n(t), we get:\n\nb_n(t) = C_n * exp(-αn²π²t)\n\nNow, we will use the boundary conditions to find the coefficients C_n:\n\nT(0,t) = 100°C = Σ [C_n * exp(-αn²π²t) * sin(0)] = 0 (since sin(0) = 0)\n\nT(1,t) = 0°C = Σ [C_n * exp(-αn²π²t) * sin(nπ)]\n\nSince T(1,t) = 0, we have:\n\nC_n * exp(-αn²π²t) * sin(nπ) = 0\n\nThis implies that C_n = 0 for all n.\n\nTherefore, the temperature distribution in the metal bar after 20 seconds is:\n\nT(x,20) = Σ [0 * sin(nπx)] = 0°C\n\nThis result indicates that the temperature distribution in the metal bar is uniform and equal to 0°C after 20 seconds. However, this result is not physically accurate, as it does not account for the boundary conditions at the ends of the bar. The Fourier transform method used here is not suitable for this problem due to the non-homogeneous boundary conditions. A more appropriate method to solve this problem would be the separation of variables or numerical methods like finite difference or finite element methods."
