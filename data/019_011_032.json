If S is only relevant to R and not to P or Q, use relevance logic to determine which of the following statements follows logically:\n\n1. P and S imply R\n2. S implies P and R\n3. R implies P and S \n\nWhich statement is logically valid?",
    "message_2": "In relevance logic, a conclusion can only be drawn if the premises are relevant to the conclusion. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. P and S imply R\nSince R is independent of Q, and P implies Q, P is not relevant to R. Also, S is only relevant to R. So, the premises P and S are not both relevant to the conclusion R. Therefore, this statement is not logically valid.\n\n2. S implies P and R\nS is only relevant to R and not to P or Q. So, S is not relevant to P. Therefore, this statement is not logically valid.\n\n3. R implies P and S\nR is independent of Q, and P implies Q, so R is not relevant to P. However, S is relevant to R. So, the premise R is not relevant to both conclusions P and S. Therefore, this statement is not logically valid.\n\nNone of the given statements are logically valid according to relevance logic."
