    "message_2": "To write the equation for the height of a passenger as a function of time, we can use a sinusoidal function. Since the wheel starts at the lowest point, we'll use the cosine function with a vertical shift and amplitude.\n\nThe amplitude of the function is half the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which is 25 meters. The vertical shift is also 25 meters, as the lowest point is at ground level. The period of the function is 80 seconds, which is the time it takes for one full revolution.\n\nThe general form of the cosine function is:\n\nh(t) = A * cos(B * (t - C)) + D\n\nwhere h(t) is the height of the passenger at time t, A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nWe know A = 25 meters and D = 25 meters. To find B, we can use the formula:\n\nB = 2 * pi / period\n\nThe period is 80 seconds, so:\n\nB = 2 * pi / 80 = pi / 40\n\nSince the wheel starts at the lowest point, there is no phase shift, so C = 0.\n\nNow we can write the equation for the height of a passenger as a function of time:\n\nh(t) = 25 * cos(pi / 40 * (t - 0)) + 25\nh(t) = 25 * cos(pi / 40 * t) + 25\n\nTo find the phase shift for one full revolution, we need to find the value of t when the wheel has completed one full revolution. Since the period is 80 seconds, one full revolution corresponds to a phase shift of 80 seconds."
