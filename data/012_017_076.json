    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In a complete graph with an even number of vertices (2n), the maximum number of perfect matchings can be calculated using the double factorial function, which is denoted as (2n-1)!!.\n\nFor a complete graph with 6 vertices (K6), the maximum number of perfect matchings is:\n\n(2*3-1)!! = 5!!\n\nNow, we calculate the double factorial:\n\n5!! = 5 * 3 * 1 = 15\n\nSo, the maximum number of perfect matchings possible in a complete graph with 6 vertices is 15."
