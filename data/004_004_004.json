    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curve y = 2x² + 3x + 1, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = 0 and x = 3, we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 0 to 3.\n\n∫(2x² + 3x + 1) dx from 0 to 3\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\n(2/3)x³ + (3/2)x² + x + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds 0 and 3:\n\n[(2/3)(3³) + (3/2)(3²) + (3)] - [(2/3)(0³) + (3/2)(0²) + (0)]\n= [(2/3)(27) + (3/2)(9) + 3] - [0]\n= [18 + 13.5 + 3]\n= 34.5\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curve, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = 0 and x = 3 is 34.5 square units."
