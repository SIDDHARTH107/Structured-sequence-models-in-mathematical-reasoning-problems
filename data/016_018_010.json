    "message_2": "The Cantor dust fractal you described is also known as the Cantor set. The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor set, at each step, the interval is divided into 3 equal parts and the middle third is removed, leaving 2 remaining parts. So, N = 2 and the scaling factor s = 3.\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is approximately 0.6309."
