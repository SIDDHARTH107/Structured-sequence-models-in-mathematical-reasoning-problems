    "message_2": "We will first show that the Cartan connection associated to the Levi-Civita connection of g can be identified with a principal K-bundle over M equipped with a K-invariant connection.\n\nLet G be the group of isometries of g, and let g be its Lie algebra. Since g is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group K, we can choose a Lie group isomorphism φ: k → g, where k is the Lie algebra of K. Let P be the orthonormal frame bundle of M, which is a principal GL(n)-bundle, where n is the dimension of M. The Levi-Civita connection on M induces a connection on P, which we will denote by A.\n\nNow, consider the reduction of the structure group of P from GL(n) to K, which is possible since the Lie algebra of G is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of K. Let P_K be the principal K-bundle over M obtained by this reduction. The connection A on P induces a connection A_K on P_K, which is K-invariant since the reduction is done with respect to the action of K.\n\nThus, the Cartan connection associated to the Levi-Civita connection of g can be identified with the principal K-bundle P_K equipped with the K-invariant connection A_K.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartan connection of M, where M is a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold with metric tensor g given by g = dx^2 + (sinx)^2 dy^2.\n\nFirst, we compute the Christoffel symbols Γ^i_jk for the Levi-Civita connection. We have:\n\nΓ^x_xy = 0, Γ^x_yx = 0, Γ^x_yy = -sin(x)cos(x),\nΓ^y_xy = 0, Γ^y_yx = cot(x), Γ^y_yy = 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the Cartan connection 1-forms ω^i_j. We have:\n\nω^x_x = 0, ω^x_y = -sin(x)cos(x) dy, ω^y_x = cot(x) dy, ω^y_y = 0.\n\nThus, the Cartan connection of M is given by the 1-forms:\n\nω^x_x = 0, ω^x_y = -sin(x)cos(x) dy, ω^y_x = cot(x) dy, ω^y_y = 0."
