    "message_1": "Suppose there are two buyers, A and B, who want to buy a painting. The values they place on the painting are $v_A=$ 500 and $v_B=$ 700, respectively. The seller knows the valuations but does not know which buyer values the painting more. The seller uses an auction mechanism to sell the painting, where each buyer submits a bid. The highest bidder wins the painting and pays their bid. In the case of a tie, the winner is chosen randomly. Calculate the revenue for the seller if both buyers bid their valuations, and calculate the revenue if the seller sets a reserve price of $600.",
    "message_2": "Case 1: Both buyers bid their valuations\n\nIn this case, buyer A bids $500 and buyer B bids $700. Since buyer B has the highest bid, they win the painting and pay their bid of $700. The revenue for the seller in this case is $700.\n\nCase 2: Seller sets a reserve price of $600\n\nIn this case, buyer A's valuation is below the reserve price, so they cannot bid their valuation. They can either not bid at all or bid at least $600. If buyer A does not bid, buyer B wins the painting by bidding their valuation of $700, and the seller's revenue is $700.\n\nIf buyer A decides to bid $600, there is still a chance they could win the painting if buyer B bids below their valuation. However, since buyer B values the painting at $700, they would likely bid their valuation or higher to secure the painting. In this case, buyer B would still win the painting and pay their bid of $700, and the seller's revenue would still be $700.\n\nIn both cases, the revenue for the seller is $700."
