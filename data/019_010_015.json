    "message_2": "To find the probability of drawing a red ball, we need to divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls in the bag.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls, making a total of 5 + 3 = 8 balls in the bag.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball is therefore:\n\nP(Red) = (Number of Red Balls) / (Total Number of Balls) = 5/8"
