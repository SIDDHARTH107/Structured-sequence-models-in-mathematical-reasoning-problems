    "message_2": "To perform a frequency analysis on the given Playfair cipher encrypted message \"WKRCNZSJZPOL\", we need to first understand how the Playfair cipher works and then use the most common letter in the English language (which is 'E') as a guide to solving the key.\n\nThe Playfair cipher uses a 5x5 grid filled with letters of the alphabet (omitting one letter, usually 'Q', to fit the 25 cells). The key is used to fill the grid, and the plaintext message is encrypted in pairs of letters.\n\nHowever, frequency analysis is not as effective on the Playfair cipher as it is on simple substitution ciphers, because the Playfair cipher encrypts pairs of letters rather than single letters. This means that the frequency distribution of the ciphertext will not directly correspond to the frequency distribution of the plaintext.\n\nTo perform cryptanalysis on the Playfair cipher, we need to look for common digraphs (pairs of letters) in the ciphertext and compare them to common digraphs in the English language. Some common digraphs in English are 'TH', 'HE', 'IN', 'ER', 'AN', 'RE', 'ES', 'ON', 'ST', and 'EN'.\n\nGiven the ciphertext \"WKRCNZSJZPOL\", we can try to identify possible digraphs and use trial and error to test different keys. However, without more information or a longer ciphertext, it is difficult to accurately determine the plaintext message using frequency analysis alone.\n\nIn conclusion, while frequency analysis can provide some insight into the possible plaintext message, it is not a foolproof method for decrypting Playfair cipher messages, especially when the ciphertext is short. More information or a longer ciphertext would be needed to increase the chances of successfully decrypting the message."
