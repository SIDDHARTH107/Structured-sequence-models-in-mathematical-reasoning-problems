Using principal component analysis, find the proportion of variance explained by each principal component and determine which variables have the highest loading on the first principal component. The data is provided below:\n\nNumber of Sales: 50, 75, 90, 60, 80\nAdvertising Expenses: $500, $750, $1000, $800, $900\nNumber of Customers: 150, 200, 250, 180, 220",
    "message_2": "To perform principal component analysis (PCA), we first need to standardize the data and then calculate the covariance matrix, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Finally, we will find the proportion of variance explained by each principal component and the loadings of the variables on the first principal component.\n\n1. Standardize the data:\n\nNumber of Sales (X1): 50, 75, 90, 60, 80\nAdvertising Expenses (X2): 500, 750, 1000, 800, 900\nNumber of Customers (X3): 150, 200, 250, 180, 220\n\nMean of X1: (50+75+90+60+80)/5 = 71\nMean of X2: (500+750+1000+800+900)/5 = 790\nMean of X3: (150+200+250+180+220)/5 = 200\n\nStandard deviation of X1: sqrt(((50-71)^2+(75-71)^2+(90-71)^2+(60-71)^2+(80-71)^2)/4) = 15.81\nStandard deviation of X2: sqrt(((500-790)^2+(750-790)^2+(1000-790)^2+(800-790)^2+(900-790)^2)/4) = 207.36\nStandard deviation of X3: sqrt(((150-200)^2+(200-200)^2+(250-200)^2+(180-200)^2+(220-200)^2)/4) = 37.42\n\nStandardized X1: (-1.33, 0.25, 1.20, -0.70, 0.57)\nStandardized X2: (-1.40, -0.19, 1.01, 0.05, 0.53)\nStandardized X3: (-1.34, 0, 1.34, -0.54, 0.54)\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix:\n\n|  1.00  0.95  0.99 |\n|  0.95  1.00  0.95 |\n|  0.99  0.95  1.00 |\n\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors:\n\nEigenvalue 1 (λ1) = 2.90\nEigenvector 1 (v1) = (0.58, 0.58, 0.58)\n\nEigenvalue 2 (λ2) = 0.10\nEigenvector 2 (v2) = (-0.71, 0.71, 0)\n\nEigenvalue 3 (λ3) = 0.00\nEigenvector 3 (v3) = (0.41, 0.41, -0.82)\n\n4. Calculate the proportion of variance explained by each principal component:\n\nTotal variance = λ1 + λ2 + λ3 = 2.90 + 0.10 + 0.00 = 3.00\n\nProportion of variance explained by PC1 = λ1 / Total variance = 2.90 / 3.00 = 0.97 (97%)\nProportion of variance explained by PC2 = λ2 / Total variance = 0.10 / 3.00 = 0.03 (3%)\nProportion of variance explained by PC3 = λ3 / Total variance = 0.00 / 3.00 = 0.00 (0%)\n\n5. Determine the loadings of the variables on the first principal component:\n\nLoadings on PC1 = v1 * sqrt(λ1) = (0.58, 0.58, 0.58) * sqrt(2.90) = (1.00, 1.00, 1.00)\n\nThe proportion of variance explained by each principal component is 97% for PC1, 3% for PC2, and 0% for PC3. All variables (number of sales, advertising expenses, and number of customers) have the highest loading on the first principal component, with a loading of 1.00."
