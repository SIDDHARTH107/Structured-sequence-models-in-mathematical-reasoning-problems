    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in length with each iteration. At each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of 4. \n\nTo find the total length of the Hilbert curve after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (4 ^ (Number of Iterations - 1))\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and the number of iterations is 5.\n\nLength = 1 * (4 ^ (5 - 1))\nLength = 1 * (4 ^ 4)\nLength = 1 * 256\nLength = 256\n\nThe total length of the Hilbert curve after 5 iterations is 256."
