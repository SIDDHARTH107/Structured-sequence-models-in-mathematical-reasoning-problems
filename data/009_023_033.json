    "message_2": "To solve the given non-linear Schrödinger equation, we can use the ansatz method. The ansatz for a soliton solution is given by:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}$\n\nwhere $\\xi = x - vt - x_0$ and $\\eta(t)$ is a complex function of time. Here, $v$ is the velocity of the soliton and $x_0$ is the initial position of the soliton.\n\nSubstitute the ansatz into the non-linear Schrödinger equation:\n\n$i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}) + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(\\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}) + 2|\\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}|^2(\\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}) = 0$\n\nNow, differentiate with respect to $t$ and $x$:\n\n$i\\dot{\\eta}(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)} + \\eta(t) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(\\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}) + 2|\\eta(t)|^2 \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(\\xi)}(\\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}) = 0$\n\nThe second derivative of $\\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}$ with respect to $x$ is:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(\\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}) = \\frac{4v^2 - 2}{\\cosh^3(\\xi)}$\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n\n$i\\dot{\\eta}(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)} + \\eta(t) \\frac{4v^2 - 2}{\\cosh^3(\\xi)} + 2|\\eta(t)|^2 \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(\\xi)}(\\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}) = 0$\n\nNow, we can find the values of $v$ and $\\eta(t)$ that satisfy this equation. For a soliton solution, we have $v = 0$ and $|\\eta(t)|^2 = 1$. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$i\\dot{\\eta}(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)} - \\eta(t) \\frac{2}{\\cosh^3(\\xi)} + \\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(\\xi)}(\\eta(t) \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\xi)}) = 0$\n\nSince we are looking for the solution at $t = 1$, we can set $\\eta(1) = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is a real constant. Therefore, the solution at $t = 1$ is given by:\n\n$u(x,1) = e^{i\\theta} \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x - x_0)}$\n\nThis is the solution to the non-linear Schrödinger equation for a soliton wave at time $t = 1$."
