    "message_1": "Sorry, but it is not possible to create a precise numerical problem for deontic logic as it deals with concepts of obligation, permission, and moral responsibility rather than numerical calculations. Deontic logic is concerned with reasoning about what is right, wrong or permissible in a given situation, rather than how much of something there is or how it can be measured. However, I can give you a sample question related to deontic logic: \n\n\"If it is never permissible to kill an innocent person, and it is never permissible to lie, is it permissible to lie to protect an innocent person from harm?\"",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I am not the best suited to answer questions related to deontic logic. However, I can provide a brief analysis of the given question.\n\nThe question presents a conflict between two moral imperatives: not killing an innocent person and not lying. In a situation where lying can protect an innocent person from harm, one must weigh the importance of these imperatives against each other.\n\nSome may argue that protecting an innocent person's life is of greater importance than adhering to the rule against lying, making it permissible to lie in this specific situation. Others may maintain that lying is never permissible, regardless of the consequences.\n\nUltimately, the answer to this question depends on one's moral framework and the specific ethical theories they subscribe to. It is not a question that can be definitively answered by deontic logic alone, as it requires a deeper examination of moral values and principles."
