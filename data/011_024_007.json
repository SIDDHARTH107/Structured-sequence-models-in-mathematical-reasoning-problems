    "message_1": "Consider a network with five nodes: A, B, C, D, and E. There are 8 directed edges between these nodes, each with a capacity of 10 units. Using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, what is the maximum flow that can be sent from node A to node E?",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum flow using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we need to know the specific connections between the nodes. Please provide the connections between the nodes (e.g., A->B, B->C, etc.) so that we can calculate the maximum flow."
