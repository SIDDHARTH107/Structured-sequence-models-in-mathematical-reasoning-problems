    "message_2": "To find the intersection of A and A', we need to determine the elements that are common to both sets. \n\nBy definition, the complement of a set A (denoted as A') contains all the elements that are not in A. Since A and A' do not share any common elements, their intersection is an empty set.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of A and A' is the empty set, denoted by âˆ… or {}."
