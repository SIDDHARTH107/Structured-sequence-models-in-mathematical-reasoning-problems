    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the non-periodic function f(x) = x^2 for -1 ≤ x ≤ 1, we first need to extend the function to be periodic. We can do this by defining the function to be even, i.e., f(x) = f(-x) for all x. This makes the function periodic with a period of 2.\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series representation of the function. Since the function is even, we only need to find the cosine Fourier coefficients. The Fourier series representation of an even function is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function (in this case, L = 1), and a_n is the Fourier coefficient for the nth cosine term.\n\nTo find a_0, we use the formula:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx, integrated over one period (from -L to L)\n\na_0 = (1/1) * ∫[x^2]dx from -1 to 1\na_0 = [x^3/3] from -1 to 1\na_0 = (1/3) - (-1/3) = 2/3\n\nTo find a_n, we use the formula:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)]dx, integrated over one period (from -L to L)\n\na_n = 2 * ∫[x^2 * cos(nπx)]dx from -1 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = cos(nπx)dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/nπ)sin(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[x^2 * cos(nπx)]dx = (x^2 * (1/nπ)sin(nπx)) - ∫[(1/nπ)sin(nπx) * 2x dx]\n\nNow, let u = 2x, dv = (1/nπ)sin(nπx)dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = (-1/n^2π^2)cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\n∫[(1/nπ)sin(nπx) * 2x dx] = (2x * (-1/n^2π^2)cos(nπx)) - ∫[(-1/n^2π^2)cos(nπx) * 2 dx]\n\nNow, we can plug this back into our original integral:\n\na_n = 2 * [(x^2 * (1/nπ)sin(nπx)) - (2x * (-1/n^2π^2)cos(nπx)) + (1/n^3π^3)sin(nπx)] from -1 to 1\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\na_n = 2 * [(1/n^3π^3) - (-1/n^3π^3)] = 4/n^3π^3\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x^2 for -1 ≤ x ≤ 1 is:\n\nf(x) = (2/3) + Σ[(4/n^3π^3) * cos(nπx)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ..."
