Suppose you take a random sample of 100 bulbs and find that the mean lifetime is 950 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. Determine if there are any outliers in the sample at the significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers in the sample, we can use the z-score method. The z-score helps us understand how far a data point is from the mean in terms of standard deviations. If the z-score is too high or too low, it may indicate an outlier.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size:\n\nSE = σ / √n\nSE = 50 / √100\nSE = 50 / 10\nSE = 5\n\nNow, let's calculate the z-score for the sample mean. The z-score is the difference between the sample mean and the population mean divided by the standard error:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\nz = (950 - 1000) / 5\nz = -50 / 5\nz = -10\n\nNow, we need to determine the critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a 0.05 significance level. Since it's a two-tailed test, we'll divide the significance level by 2:\n\nα/2 = 0.05 / 2\nα/2 = 0.025\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find the critical z-value for 0.025 in each tail:\n\nz_critical = ±1.96\n\nNow, we compare the z-score of the sample mean to the critical z-value:\n\n-10 < -1.96 and -10 > 1.96\n\nSince the z-score of the sample mean is outside the range of the critical z-values, we can conclude that there are outliers in the sample at the 0.05 significance level."
