    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is constructed by iteratively replacing each segment with a cross-like structure. The perimeter of the Vicsek fractal increases with each stage of construction.\n\nAt the first stage, the Vicsek fractal is a simple cross with 4 segments, so the perimeter is 4 units.\n\nAt each subsequent stage, each segment is replaced by a smaller cross with 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. This means that the number of segments increases by a factor of 4, while the length of each segment decreases by a factor of 3.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the Vicsek fractal at the 5th stage of construction, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (Number of segments) * (Length of each segment)\n\nAt the 5th stage, the number of segments is 4^5 = 1024, and the length of each segment is (1/3)^4 = 1/81.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Vicsek fractal at the 5th stage of construction is:\n\nPerimeter = 1024 * (1/81) = 1024/81 â‰ˆ 12.64 units."
