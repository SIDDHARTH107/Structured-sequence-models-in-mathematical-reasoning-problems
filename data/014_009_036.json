Perform the round function on R0 and the key, then XOR the result with L0 to get L1.\n3. The new R1 will be the old R0.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the second round.\n\nLet's start:\n\nPlaintext: 10101010\nKey: 11001100\n\nDivide the plaintext into two equal halves:\nL0 = 1010\nR0 = 1010\n\nRound 1:\n1. Round Function: XOR R0 with the key\n   R0 = 1010\n   Key = 1100 (we only need the right half of the key since R0 is 4 bits)\n   XOR Result = 0110\n\n2. XOR the result with L0 to get L1\n   L0 = 1010\n   XOR Result = 0110\n   L1 = 1100\n\n3. R1 = R0\n   R1 = 1010\n\nRound 2:\n1. Round Function: XOR R1 with the key\n   R1 = 1010\n   Key = 1100 (we only need the right half of the key since R1 is 4 bits)\n   XOR Result = 0110\n\n2. XOR the result with L1 to get L2\n   L1 = 1100\n   XOR Result = 0110\n   L2 = 1010\n\n3. R2 = R1\n   R2 = 1010\n\nNow, combine L2 and R2 to get the ciphertext:\nCiphertext = L2 || R2 = 1010 || 1010 = 10101010"
