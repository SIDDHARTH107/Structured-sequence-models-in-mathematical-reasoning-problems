    "message_1": "In a knapsack problem, a thief is trying to decide which items to steal from a store. The thief has a maximum carrying capacity of 10kg and is trying to choose between stealing a gold necklace that weighs 7kg and is worth $9,000 or stealing a bag of diamonds that weighs 5kg and is worth $7,000. To maximize the value of the stolen goods, which item should the thief steal?",
    "message_2": "To determine which item the thief should steal to maximize the value of the stolen goods, we need to calculate the value per kilogram for each item.\n\nFor the gold necklace:\nValue per kilogram = Value / Weight = $9,000 / 7kg = $1,285.71/kg\n\nFor the bag of diamonds:\nValue per kilogram = Value / Weight = $7,000 / 5kg = $1,400/kg\n\nSince the bag of diamonds has a higher value per kilogram ($1,400/kg) compared to the gold necklace ($1,285.71/kg), the thief should steal the bag of diamonds to maximize the value of the stolen goods."
