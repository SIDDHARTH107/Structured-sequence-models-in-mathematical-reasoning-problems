    "message_2": "Since B ∪ B is the union of set B with itself, it remains the same set B. Therefore, B ∪ B = {3, 4}.\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of A x (B ∪ B), which is A x B.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product A x (B ∪ B) is {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}."
