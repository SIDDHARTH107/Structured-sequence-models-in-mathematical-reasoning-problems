The project has three possible options, each with a different cost and expected profit: \n- Option 1: Cost $20,000 and yields a profit of $10,000 \n- Option 2: Cost $30,000 and yields a profit of $15,000 \n- Option 3: Cost $40,000 and yields a profit of $18,000 \n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit while staying within its budget. Using integer programming, determine which option(s) the company should invest in to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let's define the decision variables:\nx1 = 1 if the company invests in Option 1, 0 otherwise\nx2 = 1 if the company invests in Option 2, 0 otherwise\nx3 = 1 if the company invests in Option 3, 0 otherwise\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 10000x1 + 15000x2 + 18000x3\n\nSubject to the budget constraint:\n20000x1 + 30000x2 + 40000x3 <= 50000\n\nAnd the integer constraints:\nx1, x2, x3 âˆˆ {0, 1}\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of investments:\n\n1. Invest in Option 1 only:\nProfit = 10000(1) + 15000(0) + 18000(0) = $10,000\nBudget used = 20000(1) + 30000(0) + 40000(0) = $20,000\n\n2. Invest in Option 2 only:\nProfit = 10000(0) + 15000(1) + 18000(0) = $15,000\nBudget used = 20000(0) + 30000(1) + 40000(0) = $30,000\n\n3. Invest in Option 3 only:\nProfit = 10000(0) + 15000(0) + 18000(1) = $18,000\nBudget used = 20000(0) + 30000(0) + 40000(1) = $40,000\n\n4. Invest in Option 1 and Option 2:\nProfit = 10000(1) + 15000(1) + 18000(0) = $25,000\nBudget used = 20000(1) + 30000(1) + 40000(0) = $50,000\n\n5. Invest in Option 1 and Option 3:\nProfit = 10000(1) + 15000(0) + 18000(1) = $28,000\nBudget used = 20000(1) + 30000(0) + 40000(1) = $60,000 (This option exceeds the budget and is not feasible)\n\n6. Invest in Option 2 and Option 3:\nProfit = 10000(0) + 15000(1) + 18000(1) = $33,000\nBudget used = 20000(0) + 30000(1) + 40000(1) = $70,000 (This option exceeds the budget and is not feasible)\n\n7. Invest in all three options:\nProfit = 10000(1) + 15000(1) + 18000(1) = $43,000\nBudget used = 20000(1) + 30000(1) + 40000(1) = $90,000 (This option exceeds the budget and is not feasible)\n\nComparing the feasible options, investing in Option 1 and Option 2 yields the highest profit of $25,000 while staying within the budget. Therefore, the company should invest in Option 1 and Option 2."
