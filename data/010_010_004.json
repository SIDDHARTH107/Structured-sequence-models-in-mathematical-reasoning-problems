    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = (x^2 + y - 11)^2 + (x + y^2 - 7)^2, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is equal to the zero vector. The gradient of a function is given by the vector of its partial derivatives with respect to each variable. So, we need to compute the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2(x^2 + y - 11)(2x) + 2(x + y^2 - 7) = 4x(x^2 + y - 11) + 2(x + y^2 - 7)\n∂f/∂y = 2(x^2 + y - 11) + 2(x + y^2 - 7)(2y) = 2(x^2 + y - 11) + 4y(x + y^2 - 7)\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations to find the critical points:\n\n4x(x^2 + y - 11) + 2(x + y^2 - 7) = 0\n2(x^2 + y - 11) + 4y(x + y^2 - 7) = 0\n\nThis system of equations can be simplified to:\n\n4x^3 + 4xy - 44x + 2y^2 - 14 = 0\n2x^2 + 2y - 22 + 4xy^2 - 28y = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. One way to do this is by using a numerical method, such as the Newton-Raphson method. The solutions to this system are approximately:\n\n(3, 2), (-3.7793, -3.2832), (3.5844, -1.8481), and (-2.8051, 3.1313)\n\nNow, we need to determine whether each critical point is a local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point. To do this, we can use the second partial derivative test. We need to compute the second partial derivatives of f:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 12x^2 + 4y - 44\n∂²f/∂y² = 4x + 12y^2 - 28\n∂²f/∂x∂y = 4x + 4y\n\nNow, we need to compute the Hessian matrix H for each critical point and find its determinant:\n\nH = | ∂²f/∂x²  ∂²f/∂x∂y |\n    | ∂²f/∂x∂y  ∂²f/∂y² |\n\nIf det(H) > 0 and ∂²f/∂x² > 0, the point is a local minimum.\nIf det(H) > 0 and ∂²f/∂x² < 0, the point is a local maximum.\nIf det(H) < 0, the point is a saddle point.\n\nFor (3, 2):\nH = | 80  20 |\n    | 20  52 |\ndet(H) = 80 * 52 - 20 * 20 = 4160 - 400 = 3760 > 0, and ∂²f/∂x² = 80 > 0, so (3, 2) is a local minimum.\n\nFor (-3.7793, -3.2832), (3.5844, -1.8481), and (-2.8051, 3.1313), we can similarly compute the Hessian matrix and its determinant. We find that all of these points have det(H) < 0, so they are saddle points.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(x, y) has one local minimum at (3, 2) and three saddle points at approximately (-3.7793, -3.2832), (3.5844, -1.8481), and (-2.8051, 3.1313)."
