    "message_2": "To show that $Z(M) = Z(M_1) \\cdot Z(M_2)$, we will use the properties of topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) and the axioms they satisfy.\n\nA TQFT is a functor from the category of cobordisms (manifolds with boundary) to the category of vector spaces. The axioms that a TQFT must satisfy are:\n\n1. The partition function $Z$ assigns a complex number to a closed manifold $M$.\n2. The partition function $Z$ assigns a linear map to a cobordism (manifold with boundary) between two manifolds.\n3. The partition function $Z$ is multiplicative under composition of cobordisms.\n\nNow, let's consider the closed manifold $M$ and the closed codimension one submanifold $N$. When we cut $M$ along $N$, we obtain two manifolds with boundary, $M_1$ and $M_2$. The boundaries of $M_1$ and $M_2$ are both copies of $N$, say $N_1$ and $N_2$. We can think of $M_1$ and $M_2$ as cobordisms between the empty set and $N_1$ and $N_2$, respectively.\n\nBy the second axiom of TQFTs, the partition function assigns linear maps to these cobordisms:\n\n$$Z(M_1): \\mathbb{C} \\to V_{N_1}$$\n$$Z(M_2): \\mathbb{C} \\to V_{N_2}$$\n\nwhere $V_{N_1}$ and $V_{N_2}$ are vector spaces associated with $N_1$ and $N_2$. Since $N_1$ and $N_2$ are both copies of $N$, we have $V_{N_1} = V_{N_2}$.\n\nNow, consider the manifold $M$ as a composition of the cobordisms $M_1$ and $M_2$. By the third axiom of TQFTs, the partition function is multiplicative under composition of cobordisms:\n\n$$Z(M) = Z(M_1 \\circ M_2)$$\n\nSince $M_1$ and $M_2$ are cobordisms between the empty set and $N_1$ and $N_2$, their composition is a cobordism between the empty set and the disjoint union of $N_1$ and $N_2$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$Z(M) = Z(M_1) \\cdot Z(M_2)$$\n\nwhich is the desired result."
