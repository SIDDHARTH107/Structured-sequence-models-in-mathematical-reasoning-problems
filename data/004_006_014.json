    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) is the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. So, let's find f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(x^2 - 4x + 3)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule and the linearity of the derivative, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points, which are the points where the derivative is equal to zero or undefined. In this case, f'(x) is a linear function and is never undefined. So, we just need to find where f'(x) = 0:\n\n2x - 4 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nSo, the critical point of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 is x = 2."
