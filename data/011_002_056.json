    "message_2": "The binomial coefficient (n choose k) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n! denotes the factorial of n.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 3, so we have:\n\n(10 choose 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n\n= 10! / (3!7!)\n\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nNow we can cancel out some common factors:\n\n= (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\n= (10 × 9 × 8) / 6\n\n= 10 × 3 × 8\n\n= 30 × 8\n\n= 240\n\nSo, the value of the binomial coefficient (10 choose 3) is 240."
