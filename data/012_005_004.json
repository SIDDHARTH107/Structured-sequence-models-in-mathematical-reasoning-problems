    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. To find the diameter, we need to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices and then find the longest of these shortest paths.\n\nWe can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. The algorithm works by iteratively improving the shortest path estimates by considering intermediate vertices.\n\nLet's apply the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to the given adjacency matrix:\n\nInitial matrix (with infinity for non-adjacent vertices and 0 for diagonals):\n\n    0 1 1 ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n    1 0 1 1 ∞ ∞ ∞\n    1 1 0 ∞ 1 ∞ ∞\n    ∞ 1 ∞ 0 1 1 ∞\n    ∞ ∞ 1 1 0 1 1\n    ∞ ∞ ∞ 1 1 0 1\n    ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ 1 1 0\n\nAfter applying the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:\n\n    0 1 1 2 2 3 3\n    1 0 1 1 2 2 3\n    1 1 0 2 1 2 2\n    2 1 2 0 1 1 2\n    2 2 1 1 0 1 1\n    3 2 2 1 1 0 1\n    3 3 2 2 1 1 0\n\nNow, we need to find the longest of these shortest paths. The largest value in the matrix (excluding the diagonal) is 3. Therefore, the diameter of this graph is 3."
