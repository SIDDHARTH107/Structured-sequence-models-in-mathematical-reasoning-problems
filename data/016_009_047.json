    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it. After each iteration, the total length of the curve doubles. \n\nLet's calculate the total length after 10 iterations:\n\nInitial length (L0) = 1\n\nLength after 1st iteration (L1) = L0 * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2\n\nLength after 2nd iteration (L2) = L1 * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4\n\nLength after 3rd iteration (L3) = L2 * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8\n\n...\n\nLength after 10th iteration (L10) = L9 * 2\n\nTo find L10, we can use the formula:\n\nL10 = L0 * 2^10 = 1 * 2^10 = 1 * 1024 = 1024\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations, starting with an initial segment of length 1, is 1024."
