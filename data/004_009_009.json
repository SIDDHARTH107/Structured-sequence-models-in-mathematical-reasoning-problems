    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) + cos(x), we will use the product rule and the chain rule.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In this case, our two functions are x^2 and sin(x).\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of x^2 * sin(x):\n\nd/dx(x^2 * sin(x)) = d/dx(x^2) * sin(x) + x^2 * d/dx(sin(x))\n\nd/dx(x^2) = 2x\nd/dx(sin(x)) = cos(x)\n\nSo, d/dx(x^2 * sin(x)) = 2x * sin(x) + x^2 * cos(x)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of cos(x):\n\nd/dx(cos(x)) = -sin(x)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(x^2 * sin(x) + cos(x)) = d/dx(x^2 * sin(x)) + d/dx(cos(x))\n\nf'(x) = (2x * sin(x) + x^2 * cos(x)) - sin(x)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the derivative at x = pi/3:\n\nf'(pi/3) = (2(pi/3) * sin(pi/3) + (pi/3)^2 * cos(pi/3)) - sin(pi/3)\n\nRecall that sin(pi/3) = sqrt(3)/2 and cos(pi/3) = 1/2:\n\nf'(pi/3) = (2(pi/3) * (sqrt(3)/2) + (pi/3)^2 * (1/2)) - (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nf'(pi/3) = (pi * sqrt(3)/3 + pi^2/18) - sqrt(3)/2\n\nThis is the value of the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) + cos(x) at x = pi/3."
