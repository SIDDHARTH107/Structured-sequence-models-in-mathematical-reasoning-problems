    "message_1": "A school has 8 classrooms, and each classroom has to be painted using one of four available colors. In how many ways can the painting of classrooms be done if no two adjacent classrooms can have the same color?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of dynamic programming. Let's define two arrays, dp_same and dp_diff, where dp_same[i] represents the number of ways to paint i classrooms such that the last two classrooms have the same color, and dp_diff[i] represents the number of ways to paint i classrooms such that the last two classrooms have different colors.\n\nFor the base case, when there is only one classroom, there are 4 ways to paint it, so dp_same[1] = 0 (since no two adjacent classrooms can have the same color) and dp_diff[1] = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when there are i > 1 classrooms. If the last two classrooms have the same color, then the (i-1)-th classroom must have a different color from the i-th classroom. Therefore, dp_same[i] = dp_diff[i-1]. If the last two classrooms have different colors, then there are 3 choices for the i-th classroom's color (since it cannot be the same as the (i-1)-th classroom's color), so dp_diff[i] = (dp_same[i-1] + dp_diff[i-1]) * 3.\n\nFinally, the total number of ways to paint 8 classrooms is the sum of the number of ways to paint 8 classrooms with the last two classrooms having different colors and the number of ways to paint 8 classrooms with the last two classrooms having the same color, which is dp_same[8] + dp_diff[8].\n\nLet's calculate the values for dp_same and dp_diff for i = 2 to 8:\n\ni = 2: dp_same[2] = dp_diff[1] = 4, dp_diff[2] = (dp_same[1] + dp_diff[1]) * 3 = (0 + 4) * 3 = 12\ni = 3: dp_same[3] = dp_diff[2] = 12, dp_diff[3] = (dp_same[2] + dp_diff[2]) * 3 = (4 + 12) * 3 = 48\ni = 4: dp_same[4] = dp_diff[3] = 48, dp_diff[4] = (dp_same[3] + dp_diff[3]) * 3 = (12 + 48) * 3 = 180\ni = 5: dp_same[5] = dp_diff[4] = 180, dp_diff[5] = (dp_same[4] + dp_diff[4]) * 3 = (48 + 180) * 3 = 684\ni = 6: dp_same[6] = dp_diff[5] = 684, dp_diff[6] = (dp_same[5] + dp_diff[5]) * 3 = (180 + 684) * 3 = 2580\ni = 7: dp_same[7] = dp_diff[6] = 2580, dp_diff[7] = (dp_same[6] + dp_diff[6]) * 3 = (684 + 2580) * 3 = 7596\ni = 8: dp_same[8] = dp_diff[7] = 7596, dp_diff[8] = (dp_same[7] + dp_diff[7]) * 3 = (2580 + 7596) * 3 = 30528\n\nThus, the total number of ways to paint 8 classrooms is dp_same[8] + dp_diff[8] = 7596 + 30528 = 38124."
