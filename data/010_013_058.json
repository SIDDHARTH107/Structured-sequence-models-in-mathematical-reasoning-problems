    "message_1": "Let $E$ be a vector bundle over the topological space $X$, such that $E$ is a $k$-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$. If the transition functions of $E$ with respect to a given atlas are of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a(x) & b(x) \\\\ c(x) & d(x) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $a(x), b(x), c(x),$ and $d(x)$ are smooth functions on $X$, then find the rank of $E$ over each point of $X$.",
    "message_2": "Since the transition functions of the vector bundle $E$ are given by 2x2 matrices, it implies that the fibers of the vector bundle are 2-dimensional vector spaces over $\\mathbb{R}$. The rank of a vector bundle is defined as the dimension of its fibers. Therefore, the rank of $E$ over each point of $X$ is 2."
