    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem related to the Principal-Agent Problem in game theory:\n\nA CEO wants to incentivize his sales team to maximize profits, and decides to offer them a bonus based on the company's earnings. The sales team can choose between two strategies: a high-effort strategy that has a 60% chance of generating $100,000 in profit or a low-effort strategy that has a 40% chance of generating $50,000 in profit. The CEO offers a bonus of 10% of the company's earnings to the sales team. If the sales team chooses the high-effort strategy, what is the minimum earnings the company needs to generate in order for them to be better off than if they choose the low-effort strategy?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum earnings the company needs to generate for the sales team to be better off choosing the high-effort strategy, we need to compare the expected bonus from both strategies.\n\nExpected bonus from high-effort strategy:\n60% chance of generating $100,000 in profit = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000\n10% bonus of $60,000 = $6,000\n\nExpected bonus from low-effort strategy:\n40% chance of generating $50,000 in profit = 0.4 * $50,000 = $20,000\n10% bonus of $20,000 = $2,000\n\nNow we need to find the minimum earnings (E) that would make the high-effort strategy more attractive:\n\nE * 10% > $2,000\n\nSolving for E:\n\nE > $2,000 / 10%\nE > $20,000\n\nSo, the minimum earnings the company needs to generate for the sales team to be better off choosing the high-effort strategy is $20,000."
