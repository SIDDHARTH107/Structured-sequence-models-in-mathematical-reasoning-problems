    "message_2": "1. Gaussian elimination:\n\nWe start with the given system of equations:\n\n(1) x + 2y - 3z = 5\n(2) 2x - 5y + z = -10\n(3) 3x - y + 2z = 13\n\nFirst, we eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we multiply equation (1) by 2 and subtract it from equation (2), and multiply equation (1) by 3 and subtract it from equation (3):\n\n(1)*2: 2x + 4y - 6z = 10\n(1)*3: 3x + 6y - 9z = 15\n\nNow subtract:\n\n(2) - (1)*2: -9y + 7z = -20\n(3) - (1)*3: -5y + 5z = -2\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n(1) x + 2y - 3z = 5\n(4) -9y + 7z = -20\n(5) -5y + 5z = -2\n\nNext, we eliminate y from equation (5). To do this, we multiply equation (4) by 5/9 and add it to equation (5):\n\n(4)*(5/9): -5y + (35/9)z = -100/9\n\nNow add:\n\n(5) + (4)*(5/9): (10/9)z = -82/9\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = (-82/9) / (10/9) = -82/10 = -41/5\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into equation (5) to find y:\n\n-5y + 5(-41/5) = -2\n-5y - 41 = -2\n-5y = 39\ny = -39/5\n\nFinally, we substitute the values of y and z back into equation (1) to find x:\n\nx + 2(-39/5) - 3(-41/5) = 5\nx - 78/5 + 123/5 = 5\nx = 5 - (123 - 78)/5\nx = 5 - 45/5\nx = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = 2, y = -39/5, and z = -41/5.\n\n2. Check the answer by substituting the values of x, y, and z into the original equations:\n\n(1) 2 + 2(-39/5) - 3(-41/5) = 5\n(2) 2(2) - 5(-39/5) + (-41/5) = -10\n(3) 3(2) - (-39/5) + 2(-41/5) = 13\n\nChecking:\n\n(1) 2 - 78/5 + 123/5 = 5\n(2) 4 + 195/5 - 41/5 = -10\n(3) 6 + 39/5 - 82/5 = 13\n\nAll three equations are true with the given values of x, y, and z, so the solution is correct."
