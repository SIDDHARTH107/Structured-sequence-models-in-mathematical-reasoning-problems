    "message_1": "In a 4x4 Latin square, each row and column contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once. How many distinct Latin squares are possible?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct 4x4 Latin squares, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be any permutation of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange these numbers, which is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\n2. The first column is also fixed, as it must contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once. So, there is only 1 way to arrange the first column.\n\n3. Now, we need to fill the remaining 3x3 square. The second row can have 2 possible arrangements, as it must contain the numbers 2, 3, and 4 exactly once, and the first column is already fixed.\n\n4. Similarly, the second column can have 2 possible arrangements, as it must contain the numbers 1, 3, and 4 exactly once, and the first row is already fixed.\n\n5. Finally, the remaining 2x2 square has only one possible arrangement, as the numbers in the third row and third column are already determined by the previous steps.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct 4x4 Latin squares is 24 (first row) × 1 (first column) × 2 (second row) × 2 (second column) × 1 (remaining 2x2 square) = 24 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 1 = 96."
