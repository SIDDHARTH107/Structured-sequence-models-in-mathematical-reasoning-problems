    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find AxB and BxA, where \"x\" represents the Cartesian product operator, and then show that the union of AxB is not equal to the union of BxA.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find AxB and BxA.\n\nAxB is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. So, AxB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nBxA is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A. So, BxA = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}.\n\nNow, let's find the union of AxB and BxA.\n\nThe union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets. In this case, the union of AxB and BxA would be the set of all ordered pairs that are in either AxB or BxA.\n\nUnion of AxB and BxA = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}.\n\nNow, let's compare the union of AxB and the union of BxA.\n\nUnion of AxB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nUnion of BxA = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the union of AxB is not equal to the union of BxA, since the ordered pairs in each set are different."
