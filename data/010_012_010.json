    "message_2": "To find a smooth parametrization of the boundary of M, we can use spherical coordinates. Let's denote the spherical coordinates as (ρ, θ, φ), where ρ is the radial distance, θ is the polar angle, and φ is the azimuthal angle. We can convert the given equation in Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates as follows:\n\nρ^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given equation x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 9 in terms of ρ, θ, and φ:\n\nρ^2 = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 9\n\nWe know that x = ρ sin(θ) cos(φ), y = ρ sin(θ) sin(φ), and z = ρ cos(θ). Substituting these expressions into the equation above, we get:\n\nρ^2 = (ρ sin(θ) cos(φ))^2 + 2(ρ sin(θ) sin(φ))^2 + 3(ρ cos(θ))^2\n\nDividing both sides by ρ^2, we get:\n\n1 = sin^2(θ) cos^2(φ) + 2 sin^2(θ) sin^2(φ) + 3 cos^2(θ)\n\nSince the boundary of M is given by the equation x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 9, we have ρ = 3. Thus, a smooth parametrization of the boundary of M can be given by:\n\nx(θ, φ) = 3 sin(θ) cos(φ)\ny(θ, φ) = 3√2 sin(θ) sin(φ)\nz(θ, φ) = 3√3 cos(θ)\n\nwhere 0 ≤ θ ≤ π and 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π."
