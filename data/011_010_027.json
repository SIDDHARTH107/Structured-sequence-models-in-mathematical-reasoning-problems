    "message_1": "A group of 6 people are standing in a queue. In how many ways can they be arranged such that no two males are standing beside each other? (Assuming the group consists of 3 males and 3 females) Hint: Use Catalan numbers.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can think of the females as creating \"slots\" for the males to be placed in. There are 3 females, so they create 4 slots (before the first female, between the first and second females, between the second and third females, and after the third female). We need to place the 3 males in these 4 slots such that no two males are in the same slot.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of ways to arrange the 3 males in the 4 slots, so we are looking for the 3rd Catalan number:\n\nC_3 = (1/(3+1)) * (2*3 choose 3)\nC_3 = (1/4) * (6 choose 3)\nC_3 = (1/4) * (6!/(3!3!))\nC_3 = (1/4) * (720/(6*6))\nC_3 = (1/4) * 20\nC_3 = 5\n\nSo there are 5 ways to arrange the 3 males in the 4 slots created by the females. Now, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 3 females themselves, which is simply 3! = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 6 people such that no two males are standing beside each other is:\n\n5 (ways to arrange males) * 6 (ways to arrange females) = 30 ways."
