    "message_2": "To find the number of objects in D that are isomorphic to their dual objects, we first need to understand the structure of the derived category of coherent sheaves on X.\n\nThe algebraic variety X is a smooth projective variety, which means that it is a compact Riemann surface. In this case, X is a complex projective curve of genus 0, since it is defined by a quadratic equation in P^2. The genus 0 curve is isomorphic to the Riemann sphere, also known as the complex projective line P^1.\n\nNow, let's consider the derived category D of coherent sheaves on X. Since X is a smooth projective curve, the derived category D is equivalent to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on X, denoted Db(X). The objects in Db(X) are complexes of coherent sheaves on X, and the morphisms are chain maps modulo homotopy.\n\nTo find the objects in Db(X) that are isomorphic to their dual objects, we need to consider the dualizing sheaf ω_X. For a smooth projective curve X of genus g, the dualizing sheaf ω_X is isomorphic to the canonical sheaf K_X, which is the sheaf of holomorphic differentials on X. In our case, since X is a genus 0 curve, the canonical sheaf K_X is trivial, i.e., K_X ≅ O_X, where O_X is the structure sheaf of X.\n\nNow, let E be an object in Db(X) that is isomorphic to its dual object. Then, we have E ≅ E^* = Hom(E, ω_X), where E^* denotes the dual object of E. Since ω_X ≅ O_X, we have E ≅ Hom(E, O_X). This implies that E is a line bundle on X, as Hom(E, O_X) is a line bundle for any coherent sheaf E on X.\n\nThe line bundles on a complex projective curve X of genus g are classified by their degree, which is an integer. In our case, since X is a genus 0 curve, the degree of a line bundle on X is simply the number of zeros of a meromorphic section of the line bundle, counted with multiplicity.\n\nFor a line bundle E on X to be isomorphic to its dual object, it must satisfy E ≅ Hom(E, O_X). This condition implies that E has degree 0, as Hom(E, O_X) is a line bundle of degree 0 for any coherent sheaf E on X.\n\nThe degree 0 line bundles on a genus 0 curve X are precisely the points of the Jacobian variety J(X), which is the Picard group of X modulo linear equivalence. In our case, since X is a genus 0 curve, the Jacobian variety J(X) is isomorphic to X itself, i.e., J(X) ≅ P^1.\n\nTherefore, the number of objects in the derived category D of coherent sheaves on X that are isomorphic to their dual objects is equal to the number of degree 0 line bundles on X, which is the number of points in the Jacobian variety J(X). Since J(X) is isomorphic to the complex projective line P^1, it has infinitely many points over the field of complex numbers.\n\nHence, there are infinitely many objects in the derived category D of coherent sheaves on X that are isomorphic to their dual objects."
