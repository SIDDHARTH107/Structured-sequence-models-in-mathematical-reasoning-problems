    "message_2": "f(z) is a polynomial function, and all polynomial functions are analytic in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is an analytic function.\n\nTo find the derivative of f(z), we differentiate each term with respect to z:\n\nf'(z) = d/dz (z^3) - d/dz (2z^2) + d/dz (6z) - d/dz (10)\n\nf'(z) = 3z^2 - 4z + 6\n\nNow, we find the derivative at z = i:\n\nf'(i) = 3(i)^2 - 4(i) + 6\n\nf'(i) = 3(-1) - 4i + 6\n\nf'(i) = -3 - 4i + 6\n\nf'(i) = 3 - 4i\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) at z = i is f'(i) = 3 - 4i."
