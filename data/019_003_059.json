    "message_2": "In modal logic, \"necessarily P\" means that P is true in all possible worlds, and \"possibly Q\" means that Q is true in at least one possible world. Given that P is true in all possible worlds and Q is possible but not necessary, we can evaluate the truth value of \"necessarily P or necessarily Q.\"\n\nSince P is true in all possible worlds, \"necessarily P\" is true. Now, we just need to evaluate the \"or\" part of the statement. In this case, it doesn't matter whether \"necessarily Q\" is true or false, because \"necessarily P\" is already true. In an \"or\" statement, if one part is true, the whole statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the truth value of \"necessarily P or necessarily Q\" in all possible worlds is true."
