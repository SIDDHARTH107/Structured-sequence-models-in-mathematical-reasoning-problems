    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the equation $5x + 21y = 17$, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution and then find the general solution.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 21 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n$21 = 4 \\cdot 5 + 1$\n\n$5 = 5 \\cdot 1 + 0$\n\nSo, the GCD of 5 and 21 is 1.\n\nNow, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers $m$ and $n$ such that $5m + 21n = 1$:\n\n$1 = 21 - 4 \\cdot 5$\n\nSo, $m = -4$ and $n = 1$.\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation $5(-4) + 21(1) = 1$ by 17 to get a particular solution to the original equation:\n\n$5(-68) + 21(17) = 17$\n\nSo, one particular solution is $x = -68$ and $y = 17$.\n\nNow, we can find the general solution by noting that if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then so is $(x + 21k, y - 5k)$ for any integer $k$. This is because:\n\n$5(x + 21k) + 21(y - 5k) = 5x + 105k + 21y - 105k = 5x + 21y$\n\nSo, the general solution is given by:\n\n$x = -68 + 21k$\n\n$y = 17 - 5k$\n\nwhere $k$ is any integer."
