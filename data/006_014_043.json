    "message_1": "A company uses a system consisting of four components designed by a certain vendor. The vendor claims that the probability of a failure in each of these components is 0.1. Find the probability that a complete system failure will occur due to at least one component failing.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one component failing, we can first find the probability of none of the components failing and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a component not failing is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSince there are four components, the probability of all four components not failing is (0.9)^4 = 0.6561.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one component failing, we subtract the probability of none of them failing from 1:\n\n1 - 0.6561 = 0.3439.\n\nSo, the probability of a complete system failure due to at least one component failing is 0.3439 or 34.39%."
