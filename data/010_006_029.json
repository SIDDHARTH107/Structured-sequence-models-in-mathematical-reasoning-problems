    "message_2": "We cannot determine the second homotopy group $\\pi_2(X)$ of $X$ just by knowing the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The second homotopy group depends on the specific topological space $X$ and its higher-dimensional structure, which is not determined solely by the fundamental group.\n\nFor example, consider the following two topological spaces:\n\n1. The real projective plane $\\mathbb{RP}^2$, which has $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{RP}^2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{RP}^2) = 0$.\n2. The Klein bottle, which also has $\\pi_1(\\text{Klein bottle}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, but its second homotopy group is not trivial, $\\pi_2(\\text{Klein bottle}) \\neq 0$.\n\nThese examples show that knowing the fundamental group is not enough to determine the second homotopy group. More information about the topological space $X$ is needed to compute $\\pi_2(X)$."
