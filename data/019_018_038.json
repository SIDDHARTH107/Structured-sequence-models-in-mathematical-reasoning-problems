    "message_2": "Let's consider two odd integers, A and B. By definition, an odd integer can be represented as 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, let A = 2n1 + 1 and B = 2n2 + 1, where n1 and n2 are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of A and B:\n\nA + B = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1)\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\nA + B = 2n1 + 2n2 + 1 + 1\n\nFactor out the 2:\n\nA + B = 2(n1 + n2) + 2\n\nNow, let's represent the sum as a new integer, C:\n\nC = 2(n1 + n2) + 2\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nC = 2((n1 + n2) + 1)\n\nSince (n1 + n2) is an integer, let's call it n3:\n\nC = 2(n3 + 1)\n\nThis shows that the sum of two odd integers, A and B, results in an integer C that is in the form of 2 times an integer (n3 + 1). Therefore, the sum of two odd integers is always an even integer."
