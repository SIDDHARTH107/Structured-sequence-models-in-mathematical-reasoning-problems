    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find the number of groups of order 72 and then subtract the number of abelian groups of order 72.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nNumber of groups of order 72 = (p_1^(n_1 - 1) * (p_1^(n_1) - 1)) * (p_2^(n_2 - 1) * (p_2^(n_2) - 1))\n= (2^(3 - 1) * (2^3 - 1)) * (3^(2 - 1) * (3^2 - 1))\n= (2^2 * 7) * (3^1 * 8)\n= 4 * 7 * 3 * 8\n= 168\n\nNow, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 72. The number of abelian groups of a given order is equal to the number of partitions of the prime factors. The partitions of the prime factors of 72 are:\n\n(2^3, 3^2)\n(2^2, 2, 3^2)\n(2, 2^2, 3^2)\n(2^3, 3, 3)\n(2^2, 2, 3, 3)\n(2, 2^2, 3, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 3^2)\n(2, 2, 2, 3, 3)\n\nThere are 8 partitions, which means there are 8 abelian groups of order 72.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups:\n\nNumber of non-abelian groups of order 72 = 168 - 8 = 160\n\nThere are 160 non-abelian groups of order 72."
