    "message_1": "Consider a square of side length 4 units. Suppose you want to divide its interior into congruent right triangles with legs of length 1 unit. Determine how many triangles you need to use to completely triangulate the square.",
    "message_2": "To divide the square into congruent right triangles with legs of length 1 unit, we can first divide the square into 16 smaller squares of side length 1 unit. Each of these smaller squares can be further divided into two congruent right triangles by drawing a diagonal.\n\nSo, for each of the 16 smaller squares, we need 2 congruent right triangles. Therefore, we need a total of 16 * 2 = 32 congruent right triangles to completely triangulate the square."
