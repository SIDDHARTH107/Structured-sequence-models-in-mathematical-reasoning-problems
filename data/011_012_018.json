    "message_2": "Let A be the set of women employees and B be the set of married employees. We are given:\n\n|A| = 15 (number of women)\n|B| = 20 (number of married employees)\n|A ∪ B| = 30 (total number of employees)\n\nWe want to find |A ∩ B|, which is the number of employees who are both married and women.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have:\n\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for |A ∩ B|:\n\n30 = 15 + 20 - |A ∩ B|\n\n30 = 35 - |A ∩ B|\n\n|A ∩ B| = 35 - 30\n\n|A ∩ B| = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 employees who are both married and women."
