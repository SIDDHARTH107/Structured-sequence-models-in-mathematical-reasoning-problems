    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 2  3 -1 | 6\n| 1 -1  1 | 4\n| 3 -2  2 | 5\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, we will swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1 -1  1 | 4\n| 2  3 -1 | 6\n| 3 -2  2 | 5\n\nNext, we will eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column of Rows 2 and 3. To do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n|  1 -1  1 |  4\n|  0  5 -3 | -2\n|  0  1 -1 | -7\n\nNow, we will eliminate the 1 in the second column of Row 3. To do this, we will perform the following row operation:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 1/5 * Row 2\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n|  1 -1  1 |  4\n|  0  5 -3 | -2\n|  0  0  2 | -8\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form, and we can perform back-substitution to find the values of the variables x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n2z = -8\nz = -4\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n5y - 3z = -2\n5y - 3(-4) = -2\n5y + 12 = -2\n5y = -14\ny = -14/5\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\nx - y + z = 4\nx - (-14/5) - 4 = 4\nx + 14/5 = 8/5\nx = -6/5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -6/5\ny = -14/5\nz = -4"
