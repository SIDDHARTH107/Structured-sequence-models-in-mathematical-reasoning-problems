    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape formed by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In this case, we are only asked to remove the central cubes from each face of the original cube, which is the first iteration of the Menger sponge.\n\nThe original cube has a side length of 4 units, so its volume is 4^3 = 64 cubic units.\n\nNow, we need to remove the central cubes from each face. There are 6 faces on a cube, and we are removing one cube from each face. Each of these removed cubes has a side length of 1 unit (since it's the central cube), so the volume of each removed cube is 1^3 = 1 cubic unit.\n\nSince we are removing 6 cubes, the total volume removed is 6 * 1 = 6 cubic units.\n\nTo find the volume of the Menger sponge after removing the central cubes, we subtract the volume removed from the original cube's volume:\n\n64 - 6 = 58 cubic units.\n\nSo, the volume of the Menger sponge with a side length of 4 units after removing the central cubes from each face of the original cube is 58 cubic units."
