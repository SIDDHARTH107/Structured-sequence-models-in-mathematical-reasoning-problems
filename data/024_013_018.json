    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the space, we first need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor g. The metric tensor g is given by the matrix:\n\ng = | 1  0  0 |\n      | 0  4  0 |\n      | 0  0  9 |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of g:\n\ndet(g) = 1 * (4 * 9 - 0 * 0) - 0 * (0 * 9 - 0 * 0) + 0 * (0 * 0 - 4 * 0)\ndet(g) = 1 * 36 - 0 + 0\ndet(g) = 36\n\nThe volume form of the space is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by the differential 3-form:\n\ndV = √(det(g)) dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3\n\ndV = √(36) dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3\n\ndV = 6 dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3\n\nSo, the volume form of the space is 6 dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3."
