    "message_2": "In an optimal play of Nim, both players will try to force the other into a losing position. Let's analyze the game and find the optimal strategy for each player.\n\nFirst, let's consider the losing positions for the players. A losing position is when the player who is about to make a move is forced to lose the game, no matter what move they make. In this game, the losing positions are when there are 5, 9, or 13 stones left in the pile. This is because if a player is in a losing position, they can only take 1 to 4 stones, and the other player can always take enough stones to reach the next losing position.\n\nNow let's analyze the game from the beginning:\n\n1. If player 1 starts with 13 stones, they can take 1 to 4 stones, leaving 9 to 12 stones for player 2.\n2. Player 2, playing optimally, will take enough stones to leave player 1 with 9 stones (a losing position).\n3. Player 1 can then take 1 to 4 stones, leaving 5 to 8 stones for player 2.\n4. Player 2, again playing optimally, will take enough stones to leave player 1 with 5 stones (another losing position).\n5. Finally, player 1 can take 1 to 4 stones, leaving 1 to 4 stones for player 2. Since player 2 can take the remaining stones, they win the game.\n\nSo, if both players play optimally, player 1 will always lose the game. Therefore, there are 0 different ways the game can end with player 1 winning."
