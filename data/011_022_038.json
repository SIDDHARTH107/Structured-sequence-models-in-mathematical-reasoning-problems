He wants to carry the maximum value of items, and he has the following items:\n\n- An item weighing 4kg and worth $20\n- An item weighing 5kg and worth $15\n- An item weighing 8kg and worth $25\n- An item weighing 2kg and worth $10\n- An item weighing 3kg and worth $12\n\nWhat combination of items will give him the maximum value under the weight limit of his backpack?",
    "message_2": "To find the combination of items that will give the maximum value under the weight limit of the backpack, we can calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item and then try different combinations.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\n- Item 1: $20 / 4kg = $5/kg\n- Item 2: $15 / 5kg = $3/kg\n- Item 3: $25 / 8kg = $3.125/kg\n- Item 4: $10 / 2kg = $5/kg\n- Item 5: $12 / 3kg = $4/kg\n\nNow let's try different combinations of items, starting with the highest value-to-weight ratios:\n\n1. Items 1, 4, and 5: Total weight = 4kg + 2kg + 3kg = 9kg, Total value = $20 + $10 + $12 = $42\n2. Items 1, 3, and 4: Total weight = 4kg + 8kg + 2kg = 14kg, Total value = $20 + $25 + $10 = $55\n3. Items 1, 2, and 4: Total weight = 4kg + 5kg + 2kg = 11kg, Total value = $20 + $15 + $10 = $45\n4. Items 1, 2, and 5: Total weight = 4kg + 5kg + 3kg = 12kg, Total value = $20 + $15 + $12 = $47\n5. Items 2, 3, and 4: Total weight = 5kg + 8kg + 2kg = 15kg, Total value = $15 + $25 + $10 = $50\n6. Items 2, 3, and 5: Total weight = 5kg + 8kg + 3kg = 16kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n\nThe combination of items that gives the maximum value under the weight limit of the backpack is items 1, 3, and 4, with a total weight of 14kg and a total value of $55."
