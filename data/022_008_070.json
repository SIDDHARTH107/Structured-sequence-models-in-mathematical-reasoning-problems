    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of the function f(z) = 2z^2 - 5z + 3 in the closed unit disk |z| ≤ 1, we can first find the zeros of the function and then check if they lie within the unit disk.\n\nLet's find the zeros of the function:\n\n2z^2 - 5z + 3 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2, b = -5, and c = 3.\n\nz = (5 ± √((-5)^2 - 4(2)(3))) / (2(2))\nz = (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 4\nz = (5 ± √1) / 4\n\nSo, we have two zeros:\n\nz1 = (5 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 3 / 2\nz2 = (5 - 1) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nNow, we need to check if these zeros lie within the closed unit disk |z| ≤ 1.\n\nFor z1 = 3/2, |z1| = |3/2| = 3/2 > 1, so z1 is not in the closed unit disk.\n\nFor z2 = 1, |z2| = |1| = 1, so z2 is in the closed unit disk.\n\nThus, there is only 1 zero of the function f(z) = 2z^2 - 5z + 3 in the closed unit disk |z| ≤ 1."
