    "message_1": "A manufacturer has a total production cost of $80 per unit for a particular product. The manufacturer wants to maximize profits by setting a sales price for the product. The demand function for the product is given by Q = 1000 - 10P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price per unit. What price should the manufacturer set to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we first need to find the revenue function. Revenue is the product of the price per unit (P) and the quantity demanded (Q). So, the revenue function R(P) can be expressed as:\n\nR(P) = P * Q\n\nGiven the demand function Q = 1000 - 10P, we can substitute this into the revenue function:\n\nR(P) = P * (1000 - 10P)\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function. Profit is the difference between revenue and cost. The cost function is given as a constant $80 per unit. So, the profit function π(P) can be expressed as:\n\nπ(P) = R(P) - C(Q)\n\nπ(P) = P * (1000 - 10P) - 80Q\n\nSince Q = 1000 - 10P, we can substitute this into the profit function:\n\nπ(P) = P * (1000 - 10P) - 80(1000 - 10P)\n\nNow, we need to find the price P that maximizes the profit function. To do this, we can find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to P and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ(P)/dP = 0\n\nFirst, let's expand the profit function:\n\nπ(P) = 1000P - 10P^2 - 80000 + 800P\n\nNow, let's take the first derivative with respect to P:\n\ndπ(P)/dP = 1000 - 20P + 800\n\nNow, set the first derivative equal to 0 and solve for P:\n\n1000 - 20P + 800 = 0\n\n1800 - 20P = 0\n\n20P = 1800\n\nP = 90\n\nSo, the manufacturer should set the price at $90 per unit to maximize their profit."
