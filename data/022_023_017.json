    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we will substitute this into the given wave equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} + c^2\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = X(x)\\frac{d^2 T(t)}{dt^2} + c^2T(t)\\frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = 0$\n\nNext, we will separate the variables by dividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{d^2 T(t)}{dt^2} + c^2\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = 0$\n\nNow, we have two terms, one depending only on t and the other depending only on x. Since they sum up to zero, each term must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{d^2 T(t)}{dt^2} = -k^2$\n\n$c^2\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = k^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1) $\\frac{d^2 T(t)}{dt^2} = -k^2T(t)$\n2) $\\frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{k^2}{c^2}X(x)$\n\nThe solutions to these ODEs are:\n\n1) $T(t) = A\\cos(kt) + B\\sin(kt)$\n2) $X(x) = C\\cos(\\frac{kx}{c}) + D\\sin(\\frac{kx}{c})$\n\nNow, we will use the initial conditions to find the constants A, B, C, and D:\n\n1) $u(x,0) = X(x)T(0) = x(1-x^2)$\n2) $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = X(x)\\frac{d T(t)}{dt}\\Big|_{t=0} = 0$\n\nFrom the first initial condition, we have:\n\n$X(x) = x(1-x^2)$ and $T(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A$\n\nSo, $u(x,0) = Ax(1-x^2)$\n\nFrom the second initial condition, we have:\n\n$X(x) = x(1-x^2)$ and $\\frac{d T(t)}{dt}\\Big|_{t=0} = -Ak\\sin(0) + Bk\\cos(0) = Bk$\n\nSo, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = Bkx(1-x^2) = 0$\n\nSince this must hold for all x in the interval [0,1], we must have B = 0.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$u(x,t) = A\\cos(kt)x(1-x^2)$\n\nTo satisfy the boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = 1, we must have:\n\n$u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$\n\nThis is satisfied by the current form of the solution. Therefore, the solution to the given wave equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\n$u(x,t) = A\\cos(kt)x(1-x^2)$\n\nwhere A is an arbitrary constant, and k is determined by the specific value of c."
