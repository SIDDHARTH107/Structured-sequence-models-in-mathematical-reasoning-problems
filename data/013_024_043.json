    "message_1": "In a group project, there are 5 volunteers who contributed to the project. The total cost of the project is $1,000. Each volunteer must decide whether or not to donate $50 to support the project. If at least 3 volunteers do not donate, the project will fail and the entire cost will be lost. However, if the project is successful, the cost will be split among the volunteers who donated. \n\n(a) What is the payoff for each volunteer if all 5 volunteers donate $50? \n(b) What is the payoff for each volunteer if only 4 volunteers donate $50? \n(c) What is the payoff for each volunteer if only 2 volunteers donate $50? \n(d) Based on the payoff from the previous questions, what would be the dominant strategy for each volunteer and how much would each contribute?",
    "message_2": "(a) If all 5 volunteers donate $50, the total donated amount will be $50 * 5 = $250. Since the project is successful, the remaining cost of the project will be $1000 - $250 = $750. This cost will be split among the 5 volunteers who donated, so each volunteer will pay an additional $750 / 5 = $150. Therefore, the total cost for each volunteer will be their initial $50 donation plus the additional $150, which equals $200.\n\n(b) If only 4 volunteers donate $50, the total donated amount will be $50 * 4 = $200. The remaining cost of the project will be $1000 - $200 = $800. This cost will be split among the 4 volunteers who donated, so each volunteer will pay an additional $800 / 4 = $200. Therefore, the total cost for each of the 4 donating volunteers will be their initial $50 donation plus the additional $200, which equals $250. The volunteer who did not donate will have a payoff of $0 since they did not contribute.\n\n(c) If only 2 volunteers donate $50, the project will fail because at least 3 volunteers did not donate. In this case, the entire cost of the project will be lost, and the 2 volunteers who donated will lose their $50 donations. The other 3 volunteers will have a payoff of $0 since they did not contribute.\n\n(d) Based on the payoff from the previous questions, the dominant strategy for each volunteer would be to donate $50. This is because if at least 3 volunteers donate, the project will be successful, and the cost will be split among the volunteers who donated, resulting in a lower cost for each volunteer compared to not donating and risking the project's failure. In this scenario, each volunteer would contribute $50."
