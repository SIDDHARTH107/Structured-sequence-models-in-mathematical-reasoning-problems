    "message_1": "Sure, here is a multi-objective optimization problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two types of electronic products, P1 and P2. The production process requires two resources: labor and machine time. One unit of P1 requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while one unit of P2 requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The company has 20 hours of available labor and 16 hours of available machine time per day. The profit from each unit of P1 is $150 and from each unit of P2 is $200. \n\nWhat is the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of P1 produced and y be the number of units of P2 produced. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 150x + 200y\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 20 (labor constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 16 (machine time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 20\ny ≤ (20 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 16\ny ≤ (16 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,6), (4,4), and (5,0). We can now evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0,0): 150(0) + 200(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0,6): 150(0) + 200(6) = $1200\n3. Profit at (4,4): 150(4) + 200(4) = $1400\n4. Profit at (5,0): 150(5) + 200(0) = $750\n\nThe maximum profit is $1400, which occurs when the company produces 4 units of P1 and 4 units of P2. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 4 units of P1 and 4 units of P2."
