    "message_1": "A fair six-sided die is rolled twice. Compute the probability that the sum of the dice faces is either 7 or 11.",
    "message_2": "To compute the probability, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a sum of 7 or 11) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any two dice).\n\nThere are 6 faces on each die, so there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes. We can get a sum of 7 in the following ways: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1). That's 6 favorable outcomes for a sum of 7.\n\nWe can get a sum of 11 in the following ways: (5, 6) and (6, 5). That's 2 favorable outcomes for a sum of 11.\n\nSo, there are a total of 6 + 2 = 8 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling a sum of 7 or 11 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 8/36.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4: 8 รท 4 = 2 and 36 รท 4 = 9.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 or 11 is 2/9."
