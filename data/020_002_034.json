The production and profit data for both products as well as the usage rate of machines M1 and M2 for each of the products are given below:\n\n| Product | Machine M1 (hours per unit) | Machine M2 (hours per unit) | Profit (per unit) |\n|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| A       | 2                         | 3                         | 60                |\n| B       | 4                         | 1                         | 80                 |\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit while meeting the following constraints:\n\n- Machine M1 can be used for a maximum of 120 hours, whereas machine M2 can only be used for a maximum of 100 hours.\n- The company must produce at least 20 units of product A and 10 units of product B.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can earn and what is the optimal production plan?",
    "message_2": "To solve this linear programming problem, we'll use the following variables:\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A produced.\nLet y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 60x + 80y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 120 (Machine M1 usage constraint)\n2. 3x + y ≤ 100 (Machine M2 usage constraint)\n3. x ≥ 20 (Minimum production of product A)\n4. y ≥ 10 (Minimum production of product B)\n\nNow, we'll solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region and then find the optimal solution.\n\n1. y ≤ (120 - 2x) / 4\n2. y ≤ (100 - 3x) / 1\n3. x ≥ 20\n4. y ≥ 10\n\nWe'll find the intersection points of the constraints:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 3:\nx = 20\ny = (120 - 2x) / 4 = (120 - 40) / 4 = 20\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and 3:\nx = 20\ny = (100 - 3x) / 1 = (100 - 60) / 1 = 40\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 4:\ny = 10\nx = (120 - 4y) / 2 = (120 - 40) / 2 = 40\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and 4:\ny = 10\nx = (100 - y) / 3 = (100 - 10) / 3 ≈ 30\n\nNow we'll evaluate the objective function (P) at each of these intersection points:\n\n1. P(20, 20) = 60(20) + 80(20) = 1200 + 1600 = 2800\n2. P(20, 40) = 60(20) + 80(40) = 1200 + 3200 = 4400\n3. P(40, 10) = 60(40) + 80(10) = 2400 + 800 = 3200\n4. P(30, 10) = 60(30) + 80(10) = 1800 + 800 = 2600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the intersection point (20, 40), where the profit is 4400. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 20 units of product A and 40 units of product B, which will result in a maximum profit of $4,400."
