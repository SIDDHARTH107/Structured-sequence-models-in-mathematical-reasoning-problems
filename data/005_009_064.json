    "message_1": "Suppose you are given the following data set: \n\n6, 12, 8, 5, 10, 6, 9, 7, 12, 6\n\nUsing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a significance level of 0.05, can you determine whether the median of this data set is greater than or less than 7?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the differences between each data point and the hypothesized median (7 in this case).\n2. Rank the absolute differences, ignoring the signs.\n3. Sum the ranks of the positive differences and the ranks of the negative differences separately.\n4. Calculate the test statistic (W) as the smaller of the two sums.\n5. Compare the test statistic (W) to the critical value for the given sample size and significance level.\n\nLet's perform the test:\n\n1. Calculate the differences:\n   -1, 5, 1, 2, 3, -1, 2, 0, 5, -1\n\n2. Rank the absolute differences (ignoring the signs and excluding 0):\n   1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5\n\n   Note: Since there are three 1s, we assign them the average rank of (1+2+3)/3 = 2. Similarly, for the two 2s, we assign them the average rank of (4+5)/2 = 4.5.\n\n3. Sum the ranks of the positive and negative differences:\n   Positive differences (5, 1, 3, 5): 5 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 14\n   Negative differences (-1, -1, -1): 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n\n4. Calculate the test statistic (W) as the smaller of the two sums:\n   W = min(14, 6) = 6\n\n5. Compare the test statistic (W) to the critical value for the given sample size (n=10) and significance level (0.05). For a one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test with n=10, the critical value is 8.\n\nSince our test statistic W (6) is less than the critical value (8), we reject the null hypothesis that the median is equal to 7. However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-directional test, meaning it only tells us that the median is significantly different from 7, but not whether it's greater or less than 7.\n\nTo determine whether the median is greater or less than 7, we can look at the direction of the differences. In our case, there are more negative differences than positive ones, which suggests that the median is less than 7."
