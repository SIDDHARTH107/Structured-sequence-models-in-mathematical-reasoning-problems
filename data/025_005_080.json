    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the algebraic curve $C$, we first compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6x + 2y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 6y + 2x$$\n\nA point $(x_0, y_0)$ is a singularity if both partial derivatives vanish at that point, i.e.,\n\n$$3x_0^2 - 6x_0 + 2y_0 = 0$$\n$$3y_0^2 - 6y_0 + 2x_0 = 0$$\n\nSolving the first equation for $y_0$, we get:\n\n$$y_0 = 3x_0^2 - 6x_0$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $y_0$ into the second equation, we obtain:\n\n$$3(3x_0^2 - 6x_0)^2 - 6(3x_0^2 - 6x_0) + 2x_0 = 0$$\n\nSimplifying and factoring, we find:\n\n$$x_0(9x_0^3 - 27x_0^2 + 18x_0 - 2) = 0$$\n\nThe possible values for $x_0$ are $x_0 = 0$ and the roots of the cubic equation $9x_0^3 - 27x_0^2 + 18x_0 - 2 = 0$. For $x_0 = 0$, we have $y_0 = 0$. Thus, $(0, 0)$ is a candidate for a singularity.\n\nTo find the other possible singularities, we need to find the roots of the cubic equation. Using a numerical method or a root-finding algorithm, we find that the cubic equation has one real root, approximately $x_0 \\approx 0.879$. Substituting this value into the equation for $y_0$, we get $y_0 \\approx 0.879$. Thus, the other candidate for a singularity is $(0.879, 0.879)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these candidates are nodes. To do this, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 6$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2} = 6y - 6$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 2$$\n\nAt a node, the discriminant $\\Delta = (\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2} - (\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x \\partial y})^2) > 0$. Evaluating the discriminant at $(0, 0)$, we get:\n\n$$\\Delta(0, 0) = (-6)(-6) - (2)^2 = 32$$\n\nSince $\\Delta(0, 0) > 0$, the singularity at $(0, 0)$ is a node.\n\nEvaluating the discriminant at $(0.879, 0.879)$, we get:\n\n$$\\Delta(0.879, 0.879) = (0.274)(0.274) - (2)^2 = -3.1246$$\n\nSince $\\Delta(0.879, 0.879) < 0$, the singularity at $(0.879, 0.879)$ is not a node.\n\nIn conclusion, the algebraic curve $C$ has two singularities: one at $(0, 0)$, which is a node, and another at $(0.879, 0.879)$, which is not a node."
