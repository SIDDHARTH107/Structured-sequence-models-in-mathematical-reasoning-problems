    "message_2": "The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B. In this case, we are asked to find the intersection of A and its complement A'.\n\nBy definition, the complement of a set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements that are not in A. In other words, there are no common elements between A and A'.\n\nNow let's look at the given sets:\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA' = {7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThere are no common elements between A and A'. Therefore, their intersection is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis verifies that the intersection of A and A' is equivalent to the empty set."
