    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a particular product at a cost of $30 per unit. The demand function for the product is given by: \n\n𝑞 = 100 − 2𝑝 \n\nwhere 𝑝 is the price per unit and 𝑞 is the quantity demanded. What price should the company set to maximize its total revenue?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total revenue, we need to find the price at which the revenue function reaches its maximum value. The revenue function is given by:\n\nR(p) = p * q(p) = p * (100 - 2p)\n\nNow, we will find the critical points by taking the derivative of the revenue function with respect to the price p and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndR/dp = (100 - 2p) - 2p = 100 - 4p\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n0 = 100 - 4p\n\nSolving for p:\n\n4p = 100\np = 25\n\nSo, the company should set the price at $25 per unit to maximize its total revenue."
