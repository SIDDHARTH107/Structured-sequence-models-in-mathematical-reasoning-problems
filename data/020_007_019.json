    "message_2": "To minimize the number of trips, the company should use the trucks with the highest capacity first. In this case, the trucks can carry 600, 500, 400, and 300 crates.\n\nFirst trip:\n- Truck with 600 crates capacity: 600 crates\n- Truck with 500 crates capacity: 500 crates\nTotal crates transported: 1100\n\nAfter the first trip, there are still 100 crates left (1200 - 1100).\n\nSecond trip:\n- Truck with 400 crates capacity: 100 crates (since there are only 100 crates left)\n\nThe minimum number of trips required to transport all the crates is 2."
