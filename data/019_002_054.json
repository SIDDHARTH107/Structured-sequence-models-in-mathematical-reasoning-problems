    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the statement \"For all x, if P(x) and Q(x), then R(x)\", we need to analyze the conditions given by the predicates.\n\nLet's consider the statement \"if P(x) and Q(x), then R(x)\". This statement is saying that if x is a prime number and x is an odd number, then x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nNow let's analyze this statement with some examples:\n\n1. x = 2: P(2) is true (2 is a prime number), but Q(2) is false (2 is not an odd number). The statement \"if P(x) and Q(x), then R(x)\" is true in this case because the condition \"P(x) and Q(x)\" is false, so the implication is true.\n\n2. x = 3: P(3) is true (3 is a prime number), Q(3) is true (3 is an odd number), and R(3) is true (3 is a multiple of 3). The statement \"if P(x) and Q(x), then R(x)\" is true in this case because both the condition \"P(x) and Q(x)\" and the conclusion \"R(x)\" are true.\n\n3. x = 5: P(5) is true (5 is a prime number), Q(5) is true (5 is an odd number), but R(5) is false (5 is not a multiple of 3). The statement \"if P(x) and Q(x), then R(x)\" is false in this case because the condition \"P(x) and Q(x)\" is true, but the conclusion \"R(x)\" is false.\n\nSince we found a counterexample (x = 5) where the statement \"if P(x) and Q(x), then R(x)\" is false, the truth value of the statement \"For all x, if P(x) and Q(x), then R(x)\" is false."
