    "message_2": "To solve the equation (6x - 9)/(2x + 3) = 2, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Cross-multiply\n(6x - 9) = 2(2x + 3)\n\nStep 2: Distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation\n6x - 9 = 4x + 6\n\nStep 3: Move the 4x term to the left side of the equation by subtracting 4x from both sides\n6x - 4x - 9 = 6\n\nStep 4: Simplify the left side of the equation\n2x - 9 = 6\n\nStep 5: Add 9 to both sides of the equation to isolate the x term\n2x = 15\n\nStep 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x\nx = 15/2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 15/2."
