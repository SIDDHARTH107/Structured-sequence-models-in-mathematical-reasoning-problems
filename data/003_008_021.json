    "message_2": "To find the area of a right-angled triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 10 cm. So, the area of the triangle is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 10\nArea = 4 * 10\nArea = 40 square cm\n\nThe area of the triangle is 40 square centimeters."
