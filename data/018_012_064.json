    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B. A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow let's find (A × B) ∩ {1}. This is the set of elements that are both in A × B and in the set {1}. Since {1} contains only a single element, and A × B contains ordered pairs, there are no elements in common between the two sets.\n\n(A × B) ∩ {1} = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNext, let's find A ∩ {1}. This is the set of elements that are both in A and in the set {1}.\n\nA ∩ {1} = {1}\n\nNow let's find (A ∩ {1}) × B. This is the Cartesian product of the sets {1} and B.\n\n(A ∩ {1}) × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nNow we have the two sets (A × B) ∩ {1} and ((A ∩ {1}) × B):\n\n(A × B) ∩ {1} = ∅\n((A ∩ {1}) × B) = {(1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nSince these two sets are not equal, this demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
