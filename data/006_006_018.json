    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of making exactly k successful shots\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n attempts taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of attempts (in this case, 5 free-throw shots)\n- k is the number of successful shots (in this case, 3)\n- p is the probability of making a successful shot (in this case, 60% or 0.6)\n- (1-p) is the probability of missing a shot (in this case, 40% or 0.4)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of combinations C(5, 3):\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!)\nC(5, 3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.6^3) * (0.4^2)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.216 * 0.16\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.03456\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.3456\n\nSo, the probability that the player will make exactly 3 shots out of the 5 attempts is approximately 34.56%."
