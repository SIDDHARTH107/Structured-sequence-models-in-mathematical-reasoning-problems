    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the fact that a group of prime order is cyclic and the fact that the order of an element divides the order of the group.\n\nSince G has prime order p, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide p. The only divisors of p are 1 and p itself. If the order of an element is 1, then it is the identity element e. So, we need to find an element with order p.\n\nNow, let's consider the group G without the identity element e, which we will denote as G' = G - {e}. Since G has order p, G' has order p - 1.\n\nWe will now show that G' is a cyclic group. Let g be an element in G'. Since the order of g divides p and g is not the identity element, the order of g must be p. This means that the cyclic subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>, has order p.\n\nSince G has order p and <g> has order p, we have |G| = |<g>|. This implies that G = <g>, which means that G is a cyclic group generated by g.\n\nThus, we have found an element g in G such that g is not equal to the identity element e, and the order of g is equal to p."
