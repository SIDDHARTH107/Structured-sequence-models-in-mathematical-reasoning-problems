    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the area of a triangle is given by:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, we have a triangle with angles 30°, 60°, and 90°. First, we need to convert these angles to radians:\n\nα = 30° * (π/180) = π/6\nβ = 60° * (π/180) = π/3\nγ = 90° * (π/180) = π/2\n\nNow, we can plug these angles into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\nArea = π - (π/6 + π/3 + π/2)\n\nTo simplify, we can find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\nArea = π - (π(1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6))\nArea = π - (π(6/6))\nArea = π - π\n\nThe area of the triangle is 0."
