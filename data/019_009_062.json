    "message_2": "Intuitionistic logic is a type of logic that focuses on constructive proofs, meaning that we need to provide a construction or algorithm to prove the statement.\n\nLet's consider two odd numbers, a and b. By definition, an odd number can be represented as 2n + 1, where n is an integer. So, we can write a = 2n1 + 1 and b = 2n2 + 1, where n1 and n2 are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of these two odd numbers:\n\na + b = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1)\n\nUsing the distributive property of addition, we can rewrite this as:\n\na + b = 2n1 + 2n2 + 1 + 1\n\nNow, we can factor out the 2 from the first two terms:\n\na + b = 2(n1 + n2) + 2\n\nNotice that the expression inside the parentheses (n1 + n2) is an integer, as it is the sum of two integers. Let's call this integer k:\n\na + b = 2k + 2\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the entire expression:\n\na + b = 2(k + 1)\n\nSince k is an integer, k + 1 is also an integer. Let's call this integer m:\n\na + b = 2m\n\nThis expression shows that the sum of two odd numbers, a and b, can be represented as 2 times an integer (m). By definition, this means that the sum of two odd numbers is always even. Thus, using Intuitionistic logic, we have constructively proven that the sum of two odd numbers is always even."
