    "message_1": "Suppose the weight of apples in a basket is distributed normally with a mean of 250g and a standard deviation of 20g. If a customer randomly selects an apple from the basket, what is the probability that it weighs between 240g and 260g?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the apple weighs between 240g and 260g, we need to calculate the z-scores for both weights and then find the area under the normal distribution curve between these two z-scores.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor 240g:\nz1 = (240 - 250) / 20\nz1 = -10 / 20\nz1 = -0.5\n\nFor 260g:\nz2 = (260 - 250) / 20\nz2 = 10 / 20\nz2 = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between z1 and z2. This can be done using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in function for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the following probabilities:\n\nP(z1) = P(-0.5) ≈ 0.3085\nP(z2) = P(0.5) ≈ 0.6915\n\nThe probability of an apple weighing between 240g and 260g is the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(240g < X < 260g) = P(z2) - P(z1)\nP(240g < X < 260g) = 0.6915 - 0.3085\nP(240g < X < 260g) ≈ 0.3830\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected apple weighs between 240g and 260g is approximately 0.383 or 38.3%."
