    "message_1": "In a statistics class with 25 students, the ages of the students are as follows: \n\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42\n\nDetermine if there are any outliers in the age distribution of the class using the 1.5 × IQR rule.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers in the age distribution using the 1.5 × IQR rule, we first need to find the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nStep 1: Arrange the ages in ascending order (already done).\n\nStep 2: Find the median (Q2), which is the middle value. Since there are 25 students, the median is the 13th value:\nMedian (Q2) = 30\n\nStep 3: Find Q1, which is the median of the lower half of the data (not including the median if there's an odd number of data points). In this case, the lower half has 12 values:\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\nQ1 = (23 + 24) / 2 = 23.5\n\nStep 4: Find Q3, which is the median of the upper half of the data (not including the median if there's an odd number of data points). In this case, the upper half has 12 values:\n31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42\nQ3 = (36 + 37) / 2 = 36.5\n\nStep 5: Calculate the IQR:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 36.5 - 23.5 = 13\n\nStep 6: Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers using the 1.5 × IQR rule:\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR = 23.5 - 1.5 × 13 = 23.5 - 19.5 = 4\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR = 36.5 + 1.5 × 13 = 36.5 + 19.5 = 56\n\nNow, we check if there are any ages outside the range of 4 to 56. Since all the ages are within this range, there are no outliers in the age distribution of the class using the 1.5 × IQR rule."
