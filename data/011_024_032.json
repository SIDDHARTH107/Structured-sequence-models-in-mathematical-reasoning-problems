Each of the production centers can supply the following quantities of goods: P1=50 tons, P2=70 tons, and P3=90 tons. Each of the distribution centers demands the following quantities of goods: D1=60 tons, D2=70 tons, and D3=80 tons. The transportation cost per ton between the production and distribution centers are given in the table below:\n\n| Production Centers | Distribution Centers | D1 | D2 | D3 |\n|--------------------|---------------------|----|----|----|\n| P1                 | D1                  | 2  | 4  | 6  |\n| P1                 | D2                  | 4  | 5  | 8  |\n| P1                 | D3                  | 1  | 2  | 3  |\n| P2                 | D1                  | 3  | 5  | 7  |\n| P2                 | D2                  | 4  | 4  | 4  |\n| P2                 | D3                  | 2  | 1  | 2  |\n| P3                 | D1                  | 6  | 6  | 6  |\n| P3                 | D2                  | 5  | 5  | 5  |\n| P3                 | D3                  | 2  | 3  | 3  |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of transporting the goods from the production centers to the distribution centers such that the demands of all distribution centers are satisfied and the supply of all production centers is exhausted?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of transporting the goods, we can use the transportation algorithm. First, we need to check if the problem is balanced, meaning the total supply equals the total demand. The total supply is 50 + 70 + 90 = 210 tons, and the total demand is 60 + 70 + 80 = 210 tons. Since the problem is balanced, we can proceed with the transportation algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Find the initial basic feasible solution. We can use the North-West Corner Rule or the Least Cost Method. We will use the Least Cost Method in this case.\n\n1. Select the cell with the smallest cost (P2, D3) with a cost of 1. Allocate the minimum of the supply and demand (min(70, 80) = 70 tons). Update the supply and demand: P2 has 0 tons left, and D3 needs 10 tons more.\n2. The next smallest cost is (P1, D3) with a cost of 2. Allocate the minimum of the supply and demand (min(50, 10) = 10 tons). Update the supply and demand: P1 has 40 tons left, and D3 is satisfied.\n3. The next smallest cost is (P2, D1) with a cost of 3. Allocate the minimum of the supply and demand (min(0, 60) = 0 tons). Since P2 has no supply left, we cannot allocate any goods and must move on to the next smallest cost.\n4. The next smallest cost is (P3, D3) with a cost of 3. Allocate the minimum of the supply and demand (min(90, 0) = 0 tons). Since D3 is satisfied, we cannot allocate any goods and must move on to the next smallest cost.\n5. The next smallest cost is (P1, D1) with a cost of 4. Allocate the minimum of the supply and demand (min(40, 60) = 40 tons). Update the supply and demand: P1 has 0 tons left, and D1 needs 20 tons more.\n6. The next smallest cost is (P2, D2) with a cost of 4. Allocate the minimum of the supply and demand (min(0, 70) = 0 tons). Since P2 has no supply left, we cannot allocate any goods and must move on to the next smallest cost.\n7. The next smallest cost is (P3, D1) with a cost of 6. Allocate the minimum of the supply and demand (min(90, 20) = 20 tons). Update the supply and demand: P3 has 70 tons left, and D1 is satisfied.\n8. The next smallest cost is (P3, D2) with a cost of 5. Allocate the minimum of the supply and demand (min(70, 70) = 70 tons). Update the supply and demand: P3 has 0 tons left, and D2 is satisfied.\n\nNow all the supplies and demands are satisfied. The initial allocation is as follows:\n\n| Production Centers | Distribution Centers | D1 | D2 | D3 |\n|--------------------|---------------------|----|----|----|\n| P1                 | D1                  | 40 |  0 |  0 |\n| P1                 | D2                  |  0 |  0 | 10 |\n| P1                 | D3                  |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| P2                 | D1                  |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| P2                 | D2                  |  0 | 70 |  0 |\n| P2                 | D3                  |  0 |  0 | 70 |\n| P3                 | D1                  | 20 |  0 |  0 |\n| P3                 | D2                  |  0 | 70 |  0 |\n| P3                 | D3                  |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n\nStep 2: Check for optimality. Since there are no negative costs in the initial allocation, the solution is optimal.\n\nThe minimum cost of transporting the goods is:\n\n(40 * 4) + (10 * 2) + (70 * 4) + (70 * 1) + (20 * 6) + (70 * 5) = 160 + 20 + 280 + 70 + 120 + 350 = 1000\n\nThe minimum cost of transporting the goods from the production centers to the distribution centers is 1000."
