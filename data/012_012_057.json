    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of graph G, we can use the inequality relating the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and girth (g) in a graph:\n\nE ≤ (g - 2) * V / 2\n\nIn our case, we have V = 10 and E = 16. We want to find the smallest integer value of g that satisfies the inequality. Let's try different values of g:\n\nFor g = 3 (a triangle):\n16 ≤ (3 - 2) * 10 / 2\n16 ≤ 5\nThis inequality is false, so there must be a cycle of length 3 in the graph, and the girth is 3."
