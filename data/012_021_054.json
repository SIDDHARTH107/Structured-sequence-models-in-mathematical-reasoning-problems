    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we first need to construct a tree decomposition of the graph. A possible tree decomposition is as follows:\n\n```\n  Bag 1: {1, 2, 4}\n  Bag 2: {2, 3, 4}\n  Bag 3: {3, 4, 5}\n  Bag 4: {3, 6, 5}\n  Bag 5: {6, 7}\n```\n\nThe tree decomposition can be visualized as:\n\n```\n  Bag 1---Bag 2---Bag 3---Bag 4---Bag 5\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum size of any bag in the decomposition. The sizes of the bags are:\n\n```\n  Bag 1: 3\n  Bag 2: 3\n  Bag 3: 3\n  Bag 4: 3\n  Bag 5: 2\n```\n\nThe maximum size of any bag is 3. Therefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
