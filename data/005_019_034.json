    "message_1": "Suppose a restaurant has two types of customers, walk-ins and those who make reservations. On any given day, there is a 60% chance that a walk-in customer will return the next day, and a 90% chance that a reservation customer will return the next day. If the restaurant begins with 100 walk-in customers and 200 reservation customers today, what is the probability that there will be at least 300 customers (walk-in and reservation customers combined) returning tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of having at least 300 customers returning tomorrow, we can use the binomial probability formula. Let's denote the number of returning walk-in customers as X and the number of returning reservation customers as Y.\n\nX follows a binomial distribution with parameters n1 = 100 (number of walk-in customers) and p1 = 0.6 (probability of a walk-in customer returning).\nY follows a binomial distribution with parameters n2 = 200 (number of reservation customers) and p2 = 0.9 (probability of a reservation customer returning).\n\nWe want to find the probability P(X + Y >= 300). To do this, we can find the complement probability P(X + Y < 300) and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X + Y >= 300) = 1 - P(X + Y < 300)\n\nWe can calculate P(X + Y < 300) by summing the probabilities of all possible combinations of X and Y that result in a total of fewer than 300 customers.\n\nP(X + Y < 300) = Σ [P(X = x) * P(Y = y)] for all x and y such that x + y < 300\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probabilities.\n\nFor X, the mean (μ1) is n1 * p1 = 100 * 0.6 = 60, and the variance (σ1^2) is n1 * p1 * (1 - p1) = 100 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 24. Thus, σ1 = √24 ≈ 4.9.\n\nFor Y, the mean (μ2) is n2 * p2 = 200 * 0.9 = 180, and the variance (σ2^2) is n2 * p2 * (1 - p2) = 200 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 18. Thus, σ2 = √18 ≈ 4.24.\n\nFor the sum X + Y, the mean (μ) is μ1 + μ2 = 60 + 180 = 240, and the variance (σ^2) is σ1^2 + σ2^2 = 24 + 18 = 42. Thus, σ = √42 ≈ 6.48.\n\nNow we can use the normal approximation to estimate P(X + Y < 300):\n\nP(X + Y < 300) ≈ P(Z < (300 - μ) / σ) = P(Z < (300 - 240) / 6.48) = P(Z < 9.26)\n\nHere, Z represents a standard normal random variable. Using a standard normal table or calculator, we find that P(Z < 9.26) ≈ 1.\n\nTherefore, P(X + Y >= 300) = 1 - P(X + Y < 300) ≈ 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nThe probability of having at least 300 customers returning tomorrow is approximately 0, which means it is highly unlikely to have at least 300 customers returning tomorrow."
