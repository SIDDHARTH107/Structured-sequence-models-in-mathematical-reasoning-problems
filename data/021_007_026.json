    "message_2": "To find the positive root of the function f(x) = cos(x) - x^3 using the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = -sin(x) - 3x^2\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method formula is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nWe will start with an initial guess, x_0, within the interval (0,1). Let's choose x_0 = 0.5 as our initial guess.\n\nNow, we will iterate using the Newton-Raphson formula until the difference between consecutive approximations is less than 10^(-4).\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - f(x_0) / f'(x_0)\nx_1 = 0.5 - (cos(0.5) - 0.5^3) / (-sin(0.5) - 3(0.5)^2)\nx_1 ≈ 0.8774\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = x_1 - f(x_1) / f'(x_1)\nx_2 = 0.8774 - (cos(0.8774) - 0.8774^3) / (-sin(0.8774) - 3(0.8774)^2)\nx_2 ≈ 0.8655\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 = x_2 - f(x_2) / f'(x_2)\nx_3 = 0.8655 - (cos(0.8655) - 0.8655^3) / (-sin(0.8655) - 3(0.8655)^2)\nx_3 ≈ 0.8656\n\nSince the difference between x_3 and x_2 is less than 10^(-4), we can stop the iterations here.\n\nThus, the positive root of the function f(x) = cos(x) - x^3 within the interval (0,1) using the Newton-Raphson method, correct to four decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 0.8656."
