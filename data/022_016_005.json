    "message_2": "To find the Riemann mapping of the upper half-plane onto the disc with the origin removed, we first need to find a conformal mapping from the upper half-plane to the unit disc, and then compose it with a mapping that removes the origin from the disc.\n\nLet's denote the upper half-plane as H = {z ∈ ℂ : Im(z) > 0} and the unit disc with the origin removed as D' = {z ∈ ℂ : 0 < |z| < 1}.\n\nStep 1: Mapping the upper half-plane H to the unit disc D\n\nA well-known conformal mapping from the upper half-plane to the unit disc is given by the Möbius transformation:\n\nf(z) = (z - i)/(z + i)\n\nThis maps the imaginary axis to the boundary of the unit disc, as required.\n\nStep 2: Removing the origin from the unit disc D\n\nTo remove the origin from the unit disc, we can compose the mapping f(z) with a simple dilation:\n\ng(z) = (1 - ε)z, for some small ε > 0\n\nThe composition of f(z) and g(z) will give us the desired Riemann mapping:\n\nh(z) = g(f(z)) = (1 - ε)((z - i)/(z + i))\n\nThis maps the upper half-plane H onto the disc with the origin removed D', with the imaginary axis mapping to the boundary of the disc."
