    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n6x + 4y = 8\n3x + 2y = 4\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y = 5\n3x + 2y = 4\n\nNotice that both equations have the same left-hand side (3x + 2y) but different right-hand sides (5 and 4). This means that the two lines are parallel and will never intersect. Therefore, the system of linear equations has no solution."
