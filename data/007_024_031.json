    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies both congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The given congruences are:\n\nx ≡ 4 (mod 11)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nLet M = 11 * 7 = 77. Then, M1 = M/11 = 7 and M2 = M/7 = 11.\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of M1 and M2. That is, we need to find integers y1 and y2 such that:\n\nM1 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\nM2 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFor M1 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 11), we can see that 7 * 2 = 14 ≡ 1 (mod 11), so y1 = 2.\n\nFor M2 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can see that 11 * 2 = 22 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so y2 = 2.\n\nNow, we can find x using the formula:\n\nx = (a1 * M1 * y1 + a2 * M2 * y2) % M\n\nwhere a1 and a2 are the remainders in the given congruences (4 and 3, respectively).\n\nx = (4 * 7 * 2 + 3 * 11 * 2) % 77\nx = (56 + 66) % 77\nx = 122 % 77\nx = 45\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies both congruences is 45."
