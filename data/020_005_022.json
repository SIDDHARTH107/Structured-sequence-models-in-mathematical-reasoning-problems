    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has 200 units of raw material and 150 units of labor available. Product A requires 10 units of raw material and 5 units of labor, while Product B requires 7 units of raw material and 10 units of labor. The profit per unit for Product A is $15 and for Product B is $20. The company wants to maximize its profit. How many units of Product A and Product B should the company produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for raw material and labor are:\n10x + 7y ≤ 200 (raw material constraint)\n5x + 10y ≤ 150 (labor constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 15x + 20y\n\nTo find the feasible region, we first find the intercepts of the constraint inequalities:\n\nFor the raw material constraint:\nIf x = 0, y = 200/7 ≈ 28.57\nIf y = 0, x = 200/10 = 20\n\nFor the labor constraint:\nIf x = 0, y = 150/10 = 15\nIf y = 0, x = 150/5 = 30\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the constraint equalities:\n\n1) Intersection of raw material and labor constraints:\n10x + 7y = 200\n5x + 10y = 150\n\nMultiply the first equation by 2 and subtract the second equation:\n20x + 14y = 400\n5x + 10y = 150\n----------------\n15x + 4y = 250\n\nx = (250 - 4y) / 15\n\nSubstitute x back into the raw material constraint:\n10((250 - 4y) / 15) + 7y = 200\n\nSolve for y:\n(2500 - 40y) / 15 + 7y = 200\n2500 - 40y + 105y = 3000\n65y = 500\ny = 500 / 65 ≈ 7.69\n\nSubstitute y back into the equation for x:\nx = (250 - 4(500 / 65)) / 15 ≈ 12.31\n\nSo the intersection point is approximately (12.31, 7.69).\n\nNow we need to evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1) (0, 0): P = 15(0) + 20(0) = 0\n2) (20, 0): P = 15(20) + 20(0) = 300\n3) (0, 15): P = 15(0) + 20(15) = 300\n4) (12.31, 7.69): P = 15(12.31) + 20(7.69) ≈ 184.65 + 153.8 = 338.45\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (12.31, 7.69) with a profit of approximately $338.45. Since the company can only produce whole units of products, they should produce 12 units of Product A and 8 units of Product B to maximize their profit."
