    "message_2": "To calculate the second Chern class c2(M) of the complex manifold M, we can use the Chern classes of the tangent bundle TM of M. The Chern classes of the tangent bundle are related to the Chern classes of the manifold itself.\n\nFor a complex projective space CP^n, the tangent bundle is given by:\n\nTM = ⊕(O(-1) ⊗ O(1))\n\nwhere O(-1) is the tautological line bundle and O(1) is the dual of O(-1). In our case, n = 3, so the tangent bundle of CP^3 is:\n\nTM = O(-1) ⊗ O(1) ⊕ O(-1) ⊗ O(1) ⊕ O(-1) ⊗ O(1) ⊕ O(-1) ⊗ O(1)\n\nNow, we can use the Whitney sum formula to compute the total Chern class of TM:\n\nc(TM) = c(O(-1) ⊗ O(1))^4\n\nThe total Chern class of a tensor product of line bundles is given by:\n\nc(L ⊗ M) = c(L) * c(M)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nc(TM) = (c(O(-1)) * c(O(1)))^4\n\nThe Chern class of O(-1) is (1 - h) and the Chern class of O(1) is (1 + h), so:\n\nc(TM) = (1 - h)^4 * (1 + h)^4\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\nc(TM) = (1 - 4h + 6h^2 - 4h^3 + h^4) * (1 + 4h + 6h^2 + 4h^3 + h^4)\n\nNow, we can compute the first and second Chern classes of TM:\n\nc1(TM) = -4h + 4h = 0\nc2(TM) = 6h^2 + 6h^2 = 12h^2\n\nSince c1(M) = 3h, we can use the relationship between the Chern classes of the tangent bundle and the manifold to find c2(M):\n\nc2(M) = c2(TM) - c1(M)^2/2 = 12h^2 - (3h)^2/2 = 12h^2 - 9h^2/2 = 15h^2/2\n\nSo, the second Chern class of the complex manifold M is:\n\nc2(M) = 15/2 * h^2"
