    "message_1": "A professor has 14 assignments to grade. Each assignment is worth 100 points. There are three types of assignments: type A, type B, and type C. The average scores for type A, type B, and type C assignments are 80, 90, and 85, respectively. The professor has access to a grading system that can handle a maximum of 20,000 lines of code. Type A assignments require 500 lines of code each, type B assignments require 800 lines of code each, and type C assignments require 600 lines of code each. How many type A, type B, and type C assignments did the professor grade if he used 11,800 lines of code?",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z be the number of type A, type B, and type C assignments, respectively. We have the following system of equations:\n\nx + y + z = 14 (total number of assignments)\n500x + 800y + 600z = 11,800 (total lines of code used)\n\nWe need to find the values of x, y, and z that satisfy these equations.\n\nFirst, we can solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 14 - y - z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n500(14 - y - z) + 800y + 600z = 11,800\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n7000 - 500y - 500z + 800y + 600z = 11,800\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300y + 100z = 4,800\n\nNow, we can solve for y in terms of z:\n\ny = (4,800 - 100z) / 300\n\nSince y and z must be integers (whole numbers), we can test integer values of z to find a solution that results in an integer value for y:\n\nFor z = 1: y = (4,800 - 100) / 300 = 15.67 (not an integer)\nFor z = 2: y = (4,800 - 200) / 300 = 15.33 (not an integer)\nFor z = 3: y = (4,800 - 300) / 300 = 15 (an integer)\n\nSo, z = 3, and y = 15 - 3 = 12.\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 14 - y - z = 14 - 12 - 3 = -1\n\nThis solution is not valid since x must be a non-negative integer. Let's try another value of z:\n\nFor z = 4: y = (4,800 - 400) / 300 = 14.67 (not an integer)\nFor z = 5: y = (4,800 - 500) / 300 = 14.33 (not an integer)\nFor z = 6: y = (4,800 - 600) / 300 = 14 (an integer)\n\nSo, z = 6, and y = 14 - 6 = 8.\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 14 - y - z = 14 - 8 - 6 = 0\n\nThis solution is valid since x, y, and z are all non-negative integers.\n\nTherefore, the professor graded 0 type A assignments, 8 type B assignments, and 6 type C assignments."
