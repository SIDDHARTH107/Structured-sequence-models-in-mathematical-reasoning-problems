    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student on the topic of Chicken Game:\n\nPeter and John are playing the Chicken Game. They are both driving towards each other and the first one to swerve loses the game. If both players stay on their course, they will have a head-on collision and both will incur a loss of -10 points. If one player swerves and the other stays his course, the player who stays the course gets a payoff of 0, while the player who swerves gets a payoff of +1. If both players swerve, they will both get a payoff of +2. \n\nAssuming Peter and John are both rational and risk-averse, what is the best strategy for each player and what will be their corresponding payoffs?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for each player, we can create a payoff matrix to represent the possible outcomes:\n\n```\n               John\n               Stay   Swerve\n           ┌─────────────────┐\n  Peter    │                 │\n  Stay     │  (-10, -10)     │\n           │                 │\n           ├─────────────────┤\n           │                 │\n  Swerve   │  (1, 0)         │\n           └─────────────────┘\n```\n\nSince both Peter and John are rational and risk-averse, they will try to avoid the worst possible outcome, which is the head-on collision with a payoff of -10 points for both. \n\nGiven this, the best strategy for each player is to swerve. If both players swerve, they will both get a payoff of +2, which is the highest possible payoff for a risk-averse player in this game. \n\nSo, the best strategy for Peter and John is to swerve, and their corresponding payoffs will be +2 for each player."
