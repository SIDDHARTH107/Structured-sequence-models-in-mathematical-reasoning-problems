    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we first need to consider the prime factorization of 18, which is 2 × 3^2. Now, we can use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of a given order, which is given by the product of the partitions of each of the prime factors.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, there is only one partition: (1).\nFor the prime factor 3^2, there are two partitions: (1, 1) and (2).\n\nNow, we can use these partitions to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18:\n\n1. For the partition (1) of 2 and the partition (1, 1) of 3^2, we have the group structure C2 × C3 × C3, which is isomorphic to C6 × C3.\n2. For the partition (1) of 2 and the partition (2) of 3^2, we have the group structure C2 × C9.\n\nThus, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 18."
