    "message_1": "Suppose a clinical trial was conducted to compare the survival times of two different treatments for a certain disease. The survival times of patients in treatment A are: 3, 8, 12, 17, 21, 23, 26, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, and 42 months. The survival times of patients in treatment B are: 5, 7, 11, 14, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35, 40, and 41 months. Calculate the median survival time for each treatment, and determine which treatment has a longer median survival time.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the median survival time for each treatment, we need to find the middle value of the ordered data. Since there are 14 data points for each treatment, the median will be the average of the 7th and 8th values.\n\nFor treatment A, the survival times are already ordered: 3, 8, 12, 17, 21, 23, 26, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, and 42 months. The 7th value is 26 and the 8th value is 29. The median survival time for treatment A is (26 + 29) / 2 = 27.5 months.\n\nFor treatment B, the survival times are also ordered: 5, 7, 11, 14, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35, 40, and 41 months. The 7th value is 25 and the 8th value is 28. The median survival time for treatment B is (25 + 28) / 2 = 26.5 months.\n\nComparing the median survival times, treatment A has a longer median survival time of 27.5 months compared to treatment B's median survival time of 26.5 months."
