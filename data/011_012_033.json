    "message_2": "To find the number of students who studied at least one of these languages, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nNumber of students who studied at least one language = (Number of students who studied French) + (Number of students who studied Spanish) - (Number of students who studied both French and Spanish)\n\n= 20 (French) + 22 (Spanish) - 15 (Both)\n\n= 42 - 15\n\n= 27\n\nSo, 27 students in the group studied at least one of these languages."
