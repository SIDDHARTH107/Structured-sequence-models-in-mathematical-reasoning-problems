    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial, also known as the Tutte–Whitney polynomial, is a graph invariant that contains information about the number of spanning trees, the number of connected components, and other properties of a graph. It is defined as T(x, y) = ∑(r, k) a(r, k) x^(r-1) y^(k-1), where the sum is over all subgraphs H of G, r is the rank of H, k is the number of connected components of H, and a(r, k) is the number of subgraphs with rank r and k connected components.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can compute the Tutte polynomial by considering all possible subgraphs and their corresponding ranks and connected components. The graph G has 5 vertices and 6 edges. We can list all the subgraphs and their properties as follows:\n\n1. Empty graph (no edges): rank 0, 5 connected components\n2. Single edge: rank 1, 4 connected components\n3. Two edges without a cycle: rank 2, 3 connected components\n4. Two edges with a cycle: rank 1, 4 connected components\n5. Three edges without a cycle: rank 3, 2 connected components\n6. Three edges with a cycle: rank 2, 3 connected components\n7. Four edges without a cycle: rank 4, 1 connected component\n8. Four edges with a cycle: rank 3, 2 connected components\n9. Five edges: rank 4, 1 connected component\n10. Six edges (the entire graph): rank 4, 1 connected component\n\nNow we can compute the Tutte polynomial using the formula:\n\nT(x, y) = x^(0-1) y^(5-1) + 6x^(1-1) y^(4-1) + 6x^(2-1) y^(3-1) + 3x^(1-1) y^(4-1) + 6x^(3-1) y^(2-1) + 6x^(2-1) y^(3-1) + x^(4-1) y^(1-1) + 3x^(3-1) y^(2-1) + x^(4-1) y^(1-1) + x^(4-1) y^(1-1)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nT(x, y) = y^4 + 6y^3 + 12y^2 + 10y + 3x(y^2 + 3y + 1) + x^2(3y + 1) + 3x^3\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G is T(x, y) = 3x^3 + x^2(3y + 1) + x(y^2 + 3y + 1) + y^4 + 6y^3 + 12y^2 + 10y."
