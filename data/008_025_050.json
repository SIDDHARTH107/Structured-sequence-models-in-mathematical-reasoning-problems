    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 10\n\nWhich is the same as the first equation. This means that the two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions for this system of linear equations.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\n3y = 10 - 2x\n\ny = (10 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, for any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y using this equation. This represents the general solution for this system of linear equations."
