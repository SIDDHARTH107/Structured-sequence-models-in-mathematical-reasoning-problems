    "message_1": "Suppose a magician has 10 cards, of which 4 are red and 6 are black. If the magician chooses a card at random and shows it to the audience, what is the probability that the card is red?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the card being red, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red cards, which is 4. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of cards, which is 10.\n\nSo, the probability of the card being red is:\n\nProbability = 4/10\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\nProbability = (4/2) / (10/2) = 2/5\n\nSo, the probability that the card is red is 2/5 or 0.4 (40%)."
