    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through points $P$ and $Q$, we can use the parametric representation of the line. Let $R = (x:y:z:w)$ be a point on the line, and let $t$ be a parameter. Then we can write the coordinates of $R$ as a linear combination of the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$:\n\n$$R = (1-t)P + tQ = ((1-t) + 0t : 0(1-t) + t : 0(1-t) + t : (1-t) + 0t) = (1-t : t : t : 1-t).$$\n\nNow we need to find the condition for $R$ to lie on the curve $C$. Since $C$ is the intersection of the two quadric surfaces, we need to satisfy both equations:\n\n1. $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 0$:\n\n$$(1-t)^2 + t^2 + t^2 + (1-t)^2 = 0.$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$2 - 2t + 2t^2 + 2t^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow 4t^2 - 2t + 2 = 0.$$\n\nThis equation is always true for any value of $t$, since it represents the equation of the first quadric surface.\n\n2. $xw - yz = 0$:\n\n$$(1-t)(1-t) - t \\cdot t = 0.$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$1 - 2t + t^2 - t^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow -2t + 1 = 0.$$\n\nThis equation is also always true for any value of $t$, since it represents the equation of the second quadric surface.\n\nSince both equations are satisfied for any value of $t$, the line $R = (1-t : t : t : 1-t)$ passes through the points $P$ and $Q$ and lies on the curve $C$."
