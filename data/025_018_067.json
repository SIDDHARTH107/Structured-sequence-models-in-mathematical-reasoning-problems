    "message_2": "To find the singular points on $X$, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$, and find the points where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. The defining equation is given by:\n\n$$\nF(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3.\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 3x^2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3y^2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 3z^2.\n$$\n\nWe want to find the points $(x:y:z)$ where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, i.e., $3x^2 = 3y^2 = 3z^2 = 0$. Since we are working in projective space, we cannot have $x = y = z = 0$ simultaneously. Thus, there are three possible singular points: $(1:0:0)$, $(0:1:0)$, and $(0:0:1)$.\n\nNow, we need to prove that $X$ is not isomorphic to any smooth projective curve. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a smooth projective curve $Y$ such that $X \\cong Y$. Then, there exists a bijective morphism $\\phi: X \\to Y$ such that $\\phi$ and its inverse $\\phi^{-1}$ are both regular maps.\n\nSince $X$ has three singular points, their images under $\\phi$ must also be singular points on $Y$. However, this contradicts the assumption that $Y$ is a smooth projective curve, as a smooth curve cannot have any singular points. Therefore, $X$ cannot be isomorphic to any smooth projective curve."
