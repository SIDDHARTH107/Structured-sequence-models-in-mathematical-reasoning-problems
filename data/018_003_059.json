    "message_2": "The union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. To find the union of A and B, we combine the elements of both sets and remove any duplicates.\n\nA = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}\nB = {3, 7, 13, 17}\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the union is a superset of both sets A and B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C. In other words, if D ⊆ C.\n\nLet's check if A ⊆ (A ∪ B) and B ⊆ (A ∪ B):\n\nFor A ⊆ (A ∪ B):\nEvery element in A is also in A ∪ B:\n2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A ∪ B\n7 ∈ A ∪ B\n11 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor B ⊆ (A ∪ B):\nEvery element in B is also in A ∪ B:\n3 ∈ A ∪ B\n7 ∈ A ∪ B\n13 ∈ A ∪ B\n17 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of both A and B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of both sets A and B."
