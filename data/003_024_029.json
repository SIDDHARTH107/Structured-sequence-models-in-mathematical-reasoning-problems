    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = |A| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| is the magnitude of vector A, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and cos(θ) is the cosine of the angle.\n\nGiven that the magnitude of vector A is 6, the magnitude of vector B is 8, and the angle between them is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = 6 * cos(60)\n\nSince cos(60) = 1/2, we can simplify the expression:\n\nProjection of A onto B = 6 * (1/2)\n\nProjection of A onto B = 3\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B is 3."
