The total demand for the product in the market is given by P = 100 - Q, where P is the price of the product and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. The company's cost function is given by C(Q) = 10Q, where C is the total cost of producing Q units of the product. \n\nIf the other firm produces 30 units of the product, find the quantity that will maximize the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to find the quantity that maximizes the difference between the company's total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC). \n\nFirst, let's find the company's total revenue function. Since the other firm produces 30 units, the total quantity produced in the market is Q = q + 30, where q is the quantity produced by the company. The price function is P = 100 - Q, so we can substitute Q with q + 30:\n\nP = 100 - (q + 30)\nP = 100 - q - 30\nP = 70 - q\n\nNow, we can find the total revenue function by multiplying the price function by the quantity produced by the company:\n\nTR(q) = P * q\nTR(q) = (70 - q) * q\nTR(q) = 70q - q^2\n\nNext, let's find the company's total cost function. The cost function is given by C(Q) = 10Q, so we can substitute Q with q:\n\nTC(q) = 10q\n\nNow, we can find the company's profit function by subtracting the total cost function from the total revenue function:\n\nProfit(q) = TR(q) - TC(q)\nProfit(q) = (70q - q^2) - 10q\nProfit(q) = -q^2 + 60q\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative with respect to q and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dq = -2q + 60\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for q:\n\n-2q + 60 = 0\n-2q = -60\nq = 30\n\nSo, the company should produce 30 units of the product to maximize its profit."
