    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve: \n\nA force is applied to lift a heavy box from ground level to a height of 5 meters. The force applied to the box is represented by the function `F(x) = 20 - 2x`, where x represents the distance in meters from the ground. Find the work done by the force to lift the box to its final height using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force to lift the box to its final height, we need to integrate the force function F(x) with respect to x over the interval [0, 5]. This will give us the total work done in lifting the box.\n\nThe integral of F(x) = 20 - 2x with respect to x is:\n\n∫(20 - 2x) dx\n\nTo find the antiderivative, we can use the power rule for integration:\n\n∫(20) dx - ∫(2x) dx = 20x - x^2 + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral over the interval [0, 5]:\n\n(20(5) - (5)^2) - (20(0) - (0)^2) = 100 - 25 = 75\n\nSo, the work done by the force to lift the box to its final height is 75 Joules."
