The search interval is [-10, 10] and the population size is set to 10. Starting from an initial solution x = 2, iterate for 50 generations to find the global minimum of the function.",
    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It consists of three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The algorithm can be implemented in the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the search interval.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Repeat for the specified number of generations:\n   a. Employed bees phase: Each employed bee modifies its current solution to generate a new candidate solution and evaluates its fitness. If the new solution is better, it replaces the old one.\n   b. Onlooker bees phase: Onlooker bees probabilistically select solutions based on their fitness and perform a similar search as employed bees.\n   c. Scout bees phase: If a solution has not improved for a certain number of iterations, a scout bee replaces it with a new randomly generated solution.\n4. Return the best solution found.\n\nIn this case, we are minimizing the function f(x) = x^2 + 4x - 7 with a search interval of [-10, 10], a population size of 10, and 50 generations. We will start with an initial solution of x = 2.\n\nSince the ABC algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, the results may vary in each run. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a deterministic solution for this problem. However, you can implement the algorithm in a programming language like Python and run it to find an approximate solution. The global minimum of the function can be found analytically by taking the derivative and setting it to zero, but the ABC algorithm is useful for more complex problems where an analytical solution is not available."
