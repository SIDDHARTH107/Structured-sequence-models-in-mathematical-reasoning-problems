    "message_1": "A 4 x 4 Latin square must contain the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once in each row and column. How many distinct Latin squares are possible?",
    "message_2": "To count the number of distinct 4 x 4 Latin squares, we can use the following method:\n\n1. Fill in the first row with the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 in any order. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to do this, which is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3! ways to arrange the remaining digits, since the first digit must be different from the one above it. So, there are 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possible arrangements for the first two digits, and the last two digits are determined by the first two. So, there are 2 ways to arrange the digits in the third row.\n\n4. The fourth row is determined by the previous three rows, so there is only 1 way to arrange the digits in the fourth row.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways for each row to get the total number of distinct 4 x 4 Latin squares:\n\n24 (first row) × 6 (second row) × 2 (third row) × 1 (fourth row) = 288\n\nSo, there are 288 distinct 4 x 4 Latin squares possible."
