    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate the average salary of their employees. They have a database of 500 employees but want to sample only 50 employees. Using simple random sampling, how many possible samples of 50 employees can the company choose from the database of 500 employees?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible samples of 50 employees from a database of 500 employees, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations, n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to be chosen from the total.\n\nIn this case, n = 500 (total employees) and k = 50 (employees to be sampled).\n\nC(500, 50) = 500! / (50!(500-50)!)\n\nC(500, 50) = 500! / (50!450!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorial values and simplify the expression:\n\nC(500, 50) ≈ 2.04 × 10^41\n\nSo, there are approximately 2.04 × 10^41 possible samples of 50 employees that the company can choose from the database of 500 employees using simple random sampling."
