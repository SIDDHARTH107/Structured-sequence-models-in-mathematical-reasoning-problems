    "message_1": "A survey shows that in a market, there is a 30% chance that a consumer will buy a product after viewing an ad. If 100 consumers view the ad, what is the probability that exactly 25 consumers will buy the product?",
    "message_2": "This is a binomial probability problem. We can use the binomial probability formula to solve it:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (consumers buying the product) out of n trials (consumers viewing the ad)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (30% chance of buying the product)\n- n is the number of trials (100 consumers)\n- k is the number of successes we want (25 consumers buying the product)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 25) = C(100, 25) * 0.3^25 * (1-0.3)^(100-25)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(100, 25):\n\nC(100, 25) = 100! / (25!(100-25)!)\nC(100, 25) = 100! / (25!75!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 25) = C(100, 25) * 0.3^25 * 0.7^75\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nP(X = 25) â‰ˆ 0.0363\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 25 consumers will buy the product after viewing the ad is approximately 3.63%."
