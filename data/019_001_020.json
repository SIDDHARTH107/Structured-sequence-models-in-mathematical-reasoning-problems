    "message_2": "Let R represent \"I have no work to do.\" The given statement can be represented using propositional logic as follows:\n\n(P ∧ R) → Q\n\nAs for the truth value of the compound proposition, we cannot determine if it is true or false without knowing the truth values of P, Q, and R. The truth value of the compound proposition depends on the specific situation and the truth values of the individual propositions."
