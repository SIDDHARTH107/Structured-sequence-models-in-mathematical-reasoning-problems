    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime number with a gap of at least 20 to the next prime number, we can start by checking prime numbers and their gaps to the next prime. We can use the following list of prime numbers and their gaps:\n\n2 (gap of 1) -> 3 (gap of 2) -> 5 (gap of 2) -> 7 (gap of 4) -> 11 (gap of 2) -> 13 (gap of 4) -> 17 (gap of 2) -> 19 (gap of 4) -> 23 (gap of 6) -> 29 (gap of 2) -> 31 (gap of 4) -> 35 (gap of 6) -> 41 (gap of 2) -> 43 (gap of 4) -> 47 (gap of 6) -> 53 (gap of 12) -> 67 (gap of 14) -> 83 (gap of 18) -> 107 (gap of 20) -> 127\n\nThe smallest prime number with a gap of at least 20 to the next prime number is 107. The next prime number after 107 is 127, which has a gap of 20."
