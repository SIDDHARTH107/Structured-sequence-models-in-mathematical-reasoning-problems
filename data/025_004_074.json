    "message_2": "A singular point on a curve is a point where the curve is not smooth, meaning that its tangent is either vertical or not well-defined. To find the singular points, we can compute the partial derivatives of the curve with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given equation as F(x, y) = y(x^2 + 1) - (2x^2 + 3x - 1) = 0.\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives of F with respect to x and y:\n\n∂F/∂x = ∂(y(x^2 + 1) - (2x^2 + 3x - 1))/∂x = y(2x) - (4x + 3)\n∂F/∂y = ∂(y(x^2 + 1) - (2x^2 + 3x - 1))/∂y = x^2 + 1\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero or undefined:\n\n1) ∂F/∂x = 0 => y(2x) - (4x + 3) = 0\n2) ∂F/∂y = 0 => x^2 + 1 = 0\n\nFrom equation (2), we see that there are no real solutions for x, since x^2 + 1 > 0 for all real x. Therefore, there are no singular points on the curve C with real coordinates."
