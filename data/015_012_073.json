    "message_2": "The Lorenz attractor has three fixed points. These fixed points are the points where the system's differential equations are equal to zero. The three fixed points are:\n\n1. The origin (0, 0, 0)\n2. A positive fixed point (x, y, z) where x = y = sqrt(b*(r-1)), z = r-1\n3. A negative fixed point (-x, -y, z) where -x = -y = -sqrt(b*(r-1)), z = r-1\n\nHere, r, b, and s are the parameters of the Lorenz system. The stability of these fixed points depends on the values of these parameters."
