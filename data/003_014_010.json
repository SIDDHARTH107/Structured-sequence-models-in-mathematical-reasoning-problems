    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 3sin(2x).\n\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 3, so the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nThe period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nwhere B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, B = 2. Since we are given that the period of f(x) is π, we can set up the equation:\n\nπ = (2π) / |2|\n\nSolving for the period:\n\nπ = (2π) / 2\nπ = π\n\nThe period is indeed π, as given.\n\nThe domain of a sine function is all real numbers, as the sine function is defined for all values of x. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is:\n\nDomain: (-∞, ∞)\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of f(x) = 3sin(2x) is 3, and the domain is (-∞, ∞)."
