    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the magnetic field B(y) = 5sin(2πy/L), we first need to express the magnetic field as a sum of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nsin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix)) / (2i)\n\nSo, B(y) = 5sin(2πy/L) = (5/2i)(e^(i2πy/L) - e^(-i2πy/L))\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of B(y) by using the following formula:\n\nB(k) = (1/L) ∫[B(y)e^(-i2πky/L)] dy, where the integral is taken over the interval [0, L].\n\nPlugging in the expression for B(y) into the formula, we get:\n\nB(k) = (1/L) ∫[(5/2i)(e^(i2πy/L) - e^(-i2πy/L))e^(-i2πky/L)] dy\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nB(k) = (5/2iL) [∫(e^(i2π(1-k)y/L) dy - ∫(e^(-i2π(1+k)y/L) dy]\n\nNow, we can integrate each part:\n\nB(k) = (5/2iL) [(L/(i2π(1-k))) (e^(i2π(1-k)y/L) - 1) - (L/(i2π(1+k))) (e^(-i2π(1+k)y/L) - 1)]\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nB(k) = (5/2i) [(1/(1-k)) (e^(i2π(1-k)y/L) - 1) - (1/(1+k)) (e^(-i2π(1+k)y/L) - 1)]\n\nNow, we can find the values of the first two harmonics by plugging in k = 1 and k = 2:\n\nB(1) = (5/2i) [(1/0) (e^(i2π(0)y/L) - 1) - (1/2) (e^(-i2π(2)y/L) - 1)] = 0\n\nB(2) = (5/2i) [(1/(-1)) (e^(i2π(-1)y/L) - 1) - (1/3) (e^(-i2π(3)y/L) - 1)]\n\nSo, the values of the first two harmonics are:\n\nB(1) = 0\nB(2) = (5/2i) [(1/(-1)) (e^(i2π(-1)y/L) - 1) - (1/3) (e^(-i2π(3)y/L) - 1)]"
