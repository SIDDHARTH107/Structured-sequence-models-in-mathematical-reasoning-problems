    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using an iterative process. The perimeter of the Gosper curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of segments) * (scaling factor)^iteration\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the scaling factor is 1/sqrt(7), and the number of segments increases by a factor of 7 for each iteration.\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter after the 4th iteration with a starting equilateral triangle side length of 10cm:\n\n1st iteration:\nNumber of segments = 7\nScaling factor = 1/sqrt(7)\n\n2nd iteration:\nNumber of segments = 7^2 = 49\nScaling factor = (1/sqrt(7))^2 = 1/7\n\n3rd iteration:\nNumber of segments = 7^3 = 343\nScaling factor = (1/sqrt(7))^3 = 1/(7*sqrt(7))\n\n4th iteration:\nNumber of segments = 7^4 = 2401\nScaling factor = (1/sqrt(7))^4 = 1/49\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter after the 4th iteration:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of segments) * (scaling factor)^iteration\nPerimeter = 10 * 2401 * (1/49)\nPerimeter = 10 * 2401 / 49\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 490.2041 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Gosper curve after the 4th iteration with a starting equilateral triangle side length of 10cm is approximately 490.2041 cm."
