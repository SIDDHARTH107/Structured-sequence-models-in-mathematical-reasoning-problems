    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and the profit per unit of product B is $15. The company has 200 units of labor and 150 units of material. It takes 5 units of labor and 2 units of material to produce one unit of product A, and 4 units of labor and 4 units of material to produce one unit of product B. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can earn by producing a combination of products A and B, given the available labor and material resources?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and material are as follows:\n\n5x + 4y ≤ 200 (labor constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 150 (material constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n5x + 4y ≤ 200\n2x + 4y ≤ 150\n\nDivide the second inequality by 2:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 75\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and 5x + 4y ≤ 200:\nx = 0, y = 50\n\n2. Intersection of y = 0 and x + 2y ≤ 75:\nx = 75, y = 0\n\n3. Intersection of 5x + 4y ≤ 200 and x + 2y ≤ 75:\n5x + 4y = 200\nx + 2y = 75\n\nSolve the system of equations:\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation multiplied by 2:\n\n5x + 4y - 2(x + 2y) = 200 - 2(75)\n5x + 4y - 2x - 4y = 50\n3x = 50\nx = 50/3\n\nNow, substitute x back into the second equation:\n\n50/3 + 2y = 75\n2y = 75 - 50/3\n2y = 125/3\ny = 125/6\n\nSo, the third corner point is (50/3, 125/6).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 50) = 10(0) + 15(50) = 750\n2. P(75, 0) = 10(75) + 15(0) = 750\n3. P(50/3, 125/6) = 10(50/3) + 15(125/6) = 2500/3 + 3125/2 = 791.67 (approximately)\n\nThe maximum profit the company can earn by producing a combination of products A and B, given the available labor and material resources, is $791.67 (approximately)."
