    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in the unit square. It was one of the first examples of a curve that fills the entire space, and it was introduced by Giuseppe Peano in 1890.\n\nThe length of the Peano curve is actually infinite. This might seem counterintuitive, but it is a result of the curve's fractal nature. The curve is constructed by recursively subdividing the unit square into smaller squares and connecting them with segments. As the number of iterations approaches infinity, the length of the curve increases without bound.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider the first few iterations of the Peano curve construction. In the first iteration, the unit square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the curve has a length of 8 times the side length of the smaller squares. In the second iteration, each of the smaller squares is divided into 9 even smaller squares, and the curve has a length of 8 times the side length of the even smaller squares, but there are now 9 times as many segments. This pattern continues with each iteration, and the length of the curve increases without bound.\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve in terms of the side length of the unit square is infinite."
