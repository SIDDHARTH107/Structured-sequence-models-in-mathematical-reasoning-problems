    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A = {1, 2, 3}. Find the size of the power set of A and compare it to the size of the set A itself. Does it prove that the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself?",
    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself. In this case, A = {1, 2, 3}. To find the power set of A, we list all possible subsets:\n\nP(A) = {âˆ…, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}\n\nThe size of the power set of A, |P(A)|, is the number of elements in P(A). In this case, there are 8 elements in P(A), so |P(A)| = 8.\n\nThe size of the set A, |A|, is the number of elements in A. In this case, there are 3 elements in A, so |A| = 3.\n\nComparing the sizes, we see that |P(A)| > |A|, as 8 > 3.\n\nThis example supports the theorem that the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself. In general, for a set A with |A| = n elements, the size of its power set |P(A)| = 2^n. Since 2^n is always greater than n for any non-negative integer n, the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself."
