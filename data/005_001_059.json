    "message_1": "Suppose a shoe manufacturer claims that their average heel height is 2.5 inches. A random sample of 50 shoes is taken and the average heel height is found to be 2.3 inches with a standard deviation of 0.6 inches. Using a significance level of 0.05, can you reject the manufacturer's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average heel height is 2.5 inches, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average heel height is not 2.5 inches.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (2.3 - 2.5) / (0.6 / sqrt(50))\n\nt = (-0.2) / (0.6 / 7.071)\n\nt = -0.2 / 0.0849\n\nt ≈ -2.36\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (since the sample size is 50). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.01.\n\nSince our calculated t-score of -2.36 is less than the critical t-value of -2.01, we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is significant evidence to suggest that the average heel height is not 2.5 inches at a 0.05 significance level."
