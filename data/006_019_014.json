    "message_2": "Since the probability of the incumbent president winning the election in Country A has been 0.6 in the past 5 presidential elections, we can assume that this probability remains the same for the next presidential election. Therefore, the probability that the incumbent president will win the next presidential election in Country A is 0.6 or 60%."
