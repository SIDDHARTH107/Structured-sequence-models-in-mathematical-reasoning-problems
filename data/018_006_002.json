    "message_1": "Consider the universal set U={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. Let set A={1,3,5,7,9}. Find the complement of set A and then find the union of set A and its complement. Verify that the result is same as the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', can be found as follows:\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of set A and the universal set U, we can determine the elements that are not in set A:\n\nA' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements of both sets. \n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the union of set A and its complement A' is the same as the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThis verifies that the result is the same as the universal set U."
