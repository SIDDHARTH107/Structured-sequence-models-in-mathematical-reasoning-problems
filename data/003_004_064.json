    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2 cos(x) + 1 = 0 over the interval [0, 2π], follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate the cosine function:\n2 cos(x) + 1 = 0\n2 cos(x) = -1\ncos(x) = -1/2\n\n2. Find the angles x in the given interval [0, 2π] that satisfy the equation:\ncos(x) = -1/2\n\nThe angles that satisfy this equation are x = 2π/3 and x = 4π/3.\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 2 cos(x) + 1 = 0 over the interval [0, 2π] are x = 2π/3 and x = 4π/3."
