    "message_1": "Consider the system of linear equations:\n-2x + 3y = 7\n4x - 6y = -14\nWhat is the solution to this system of equations?",
    "message_2": "First, we can observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n-4x + 6y = 14\n\nWhich is the same as the second equation, but with the opposite signs. This means that the two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations, and they lie along the line represented by either equation. \n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. For example, we can solve for y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\n3y = 2x + 7\ny = (2/3)x + 7/3\n\nSo the general solution is y = (2/3)x + 7/3, and any point (x, y) that satisfies this equation is a solution to the system of equations."
