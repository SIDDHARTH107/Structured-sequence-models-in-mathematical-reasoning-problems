In this case, we want to find the number of ways to partition the number 5 into distinct positive integers, meaning each integer in the partition is unique.\n\nHere are the possible partitions of 5 into distinct positive integers:\n\n1. 5\n2. 4 + 1\n3. 3 + 2\n\nThere are 3 ways to partition the number 5 into distinct positive integers."
