    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node E, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Start with an initial flow of 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path:\n\n   Path: A -> B -> D -> E\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(4, 3, 5) = 3\n\n3. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   - Edge AB: 4 - 3 = 1\n   - Edge AC: 6\n   - Edge BD: 3 - 3 = 0\n   - Edge CD: 7\n   - Edge CE: 4\n   - Edge DE: 5 - 3 = 2\n\n4. Find another augmenting path:\n\n   Path: A -> C -> D -> E\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(6, 7, 2) = 2\n\n5. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   - Edge AB: 1\n   - Edge AC: 6 - 2 = 4\n   - Edge BD: 0\n   - Edge CD: 7 - 2 = 5\n   - Edge CE: 4\n   - Edge DE: 2 - 2 = 0\n\n6. Find another augmenting path:\n\n   Path: A -> C -> E\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(4, 4) = 4\n\n7. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   - Edge AB: 1\n   - Edge AC: 4 - 4 = 0\n   - Edge BD: 0\n   - Edge CD: 5\n   - Edge CE: 4 - 4 = 0\n   - Edge DE: 0\n\nAt this point, there are no more augmenting paths. The maximum flow from node A to node E is the sum of the flows found in the augmenting paths: 3 + 2 + 4 = 9."
