If $\\langle a\\rangle=G,$ then G is cyclic and is isomorphic to C4. Otherwise, $\\langle a\\rangle$ contains only the identity element and a, and there must be another element b in G which is not in $\\langle a\\rangle$. Define a subgroup $\\langle b\\rangle$ generated by b. If $\\langle b\\rangle=G,$ then G is isomorphic to C4. Otherwise, $\\langle b\\rangle$ also contains only the identity element and b, and we have $G=\\{e,a,b,c\\}$ where c is neither a nor b. \n\nProve that G is isomorphic to V4.",
    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to V4 (the Klein four-group), we need to show that there exists a group isomorphism between G and V4. Recall that V4 is the group with elements {e, a, b, c} and the following operation table:\n\n```\n  e a b c\ne e a b c\na a e c b\nb b c e a\nc c b a e\n```\n\nWe will show that G has the same operation table as V4. Since G has order 4 and we have already excluded the possibility of G being cyclic, we know that the order of a and b must be 2. Thus, we have:\n\n1. a * a = e\n2. b * b = e\n\nNow, consider the element c. Since c is not equal to a, b, or e, we have:\n\n3. c ≠ e\n4. c ≠ a\n5. c ≠ b\n\nNow, let's consider the product of a and b. Since G is a group, the product ab must be in G. We have four possibilities for the product ab: e, a, b, or c.\n\n- If ab = e, then G would be abelian and generated by a and b, which would make G isomorphic to C4, contradicting our assumption that G is not cyclic.\n- If ab = a, then b = e, which contradicts the fact that b is not the identity element.\n- If ab = b, then a = e, which contradicts the fact that a is not the identity element.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility left is:\n\n6. ab = c\n\nNow, consider the product ac. We have four possibilities for the product ac: e, a, b, or c.\n\n- If ac = e, then c = a^(-1), which contradicts the fact that c is not equal to a.\n- If ac = a, then c = e, which contradicts the fact that c is not the identity element.\n- If ac = c, then a = e, which contradicts the fact that a is not the identity element.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility left is:\n\n7. ac = b\n\nSimilarly, considering the product bc, we can rule out the possibilities e, a, and b, leaving us with:\n\n8. bc = a\n\nNow, we have shown that G has the same operation table as V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4."
