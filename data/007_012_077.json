    "message_2": "According to Wilson's theorem, for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. We are asked to find the smallest positive integer value of n (which is a prime number) that satisfies this condition.\n\nLet's start by testing the smallest prime numbers:\n\n1. For n = 2 (smallest prime number), (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 is divisible by 2, n = 2 is the smallest positive integer value that satisfies the given condition."
