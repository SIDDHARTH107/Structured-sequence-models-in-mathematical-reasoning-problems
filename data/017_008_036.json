    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems and then construct the multiplication tables for each case.\n\nSince the order of G is 8, we know that G has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, the number of such subgroups divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Since 8 is a power of 2, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be G itself. Thus, G is a p-group for p = 2.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of G:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group of order 8 (C8): In this case, G has a single generator, say g, and its elements are {1, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7}. The multiplication table is determined by the powers of g, with the relation g^8 = 1.\n\n2. G is the quaternion group (Q8): In this case, G has 8 elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} with the relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. The multiplication table is determined by these relations and the quaternion multiplication rules (e.g., ij = k, ji = -k, etc.).\n\n3. G is the dihedral group of order 8 (D4): In this case, G represents the symmetries of a square and has 8 elements {1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r represents a rotation by 90 degrees and s represents a reflection. The relations are r^4 = 1, s^2 = 1, and sr = r^(-1)s. The multiplication table is determined by these relations and the dihedral group structure.\n\nNow, we will show that G must be isomorphic to one of these three groups. Since G is a p-group, its center Z(G) is nontrivial. We have three cases to consider:\n\n1. Z(G) has order 8: In this case, G is abelian and has a single generator, so G is isomorphic to C8.\n\n2. Z(G) has order 4: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 2, which must be cyclic. Thus, G is a semi-direct product of Z(G) and a subgroup of order 2. The only such group is Q8, so G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\n3. Z(G) has order 2: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 4, which must be either cyclic or the Klein four-group. If G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G has a normal subgroup of order 4, which must be isomorphic to C4. The only group with this structure is D4, so G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nIn each case, we have shown that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of these three groups."
