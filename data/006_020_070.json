    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 320 people have a pet dog. If you randomly select two people from the community, what is the probability that both of them have a pet dog? Round your answer to three decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both people have a pet dog, we can use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nWhen selecting the first person, there are 320 favorable outcomes (people with a pet dog) out of 500 total people. So the probability for the first person is:\n\nP(first person) = 320/500\n\nNow, there are only 499 people left to choose from, and 319 of them have a pet dog. So the probability for the second person is:\n\nP(second person) = 319/499\n\nTo find the probability that both people have a pet dog, we multiply the probabilities:\n\nP(both) = P(first person) * P(second person) = (320/500) * (319/499)\n\nP(both) â‰ˆ 0.409\n\nSo the probability that both people have a pet dog is approximately 0.409 or 40.9%."
