    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem related to Mechanism Design in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose there are two players who want to divide a cake. Player 1 values the cake according to a square root function, and player 2 values the cake according to a logarithmic function. The cake is divided such that each player receives a piece of cake. Find the mechanism design (i.e. allocation rule) that maximizes the sum of the players' valuations.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the fraction of the cake allocated to player 1, and (1-x) be the fraction allocated to player 2. We want to maximize the sum of their valuations.\n\nPlayer 1's valuation function is V1(x) = sqrt(x), and player 2's valuation function is V2(1-x) = ln(1-x).\n\nWe want to maximize the sum of their valuations, which is V1(x) + V2(1-x). So, we need to find the maximum of the function:\n\nF(x) = sqrt(x) + ln(1-x)\n\nTo find the maximum, we take the first derivative of F(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nF'(x) = d(sqrt(x))/dx + d(ln(1-x))/dx = 0\n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)), and the derivative of ln(1-x) is -1/(1-x). So,\n\n1/(2*sqrt(x)) - 1/(1-x) = 0\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n1/(2*sqrt(x)) = 1/(1-x)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n2*sqrt(x) * (1-x) = 1\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n2x - 2x^2 = 1\n\n2x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx^2 - x + 1/2 = 0\n\nNow, we use the quadratic formula to find the value of x:\n\nx = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = 1/2:\n\nx = (1 ± sqrt((-1)^2 - 4(1)(1/2))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± sqrt(1 - 2)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (1 - 2) is negative, there is no real solution for x. However, we can still find the maximum value of F(x) by analyzing the function.\n\nThe function F(x) = sqrt(x) + ln(1-x) is increasing for x in the interval (0, 1/2) and decreasing for x in the interval (1/2, 1). Therefore, the maximum value of F(x) occurs at x = 1/2.\n\nSo, the mechanism design that maximizes the sum of the players' valuations is to allocate half of the cake to each player:\n\nPlayer 1 gets x = 1/2 of the cake, and player 2 gets (1-x) = 1/2 of the cake."
