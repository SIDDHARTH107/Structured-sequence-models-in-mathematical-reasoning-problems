    "message_1": "Consider two parties named Alice and Bob who want to establish a shared secret key using Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice chooses a prime number  p=11  and a primitive root of 11. Alice's secret key is  x=3  and Bob's secret key is  y=7. Now, answer the following questions:\nWhat will be the public keys of Alice and Bob respectively?\nWhat will be the shared secret key established between Alice and Bob?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find a primitive root of 11. A primitive root g of a prime number p is an integer that generates all the non-zero elements of the finite field Z_p (i.e., the set {1, 2, ..., p-1}) under modular exponentiation. For p=11, we can choose g=2, as it is a primitive root of 11.\n\nNow, let's compute the public keys of Alice and Bob:\n\nAlice's public key (A) = g^x mod p = 2^3 mod 11 = 8\nBob's public key (B) = g^y mod p = 2^7 mod 11 = 7\n\nNow, let's compute the shared secret key:\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^x mod p = 7^3 mod 11 = 2\nBob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^y mod p = 8^7 mod 11 = 2\n\nSince K_A = K_B, the shared secret key established between Alice and Bob is 2."
