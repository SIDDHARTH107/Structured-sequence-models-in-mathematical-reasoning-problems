    "message_2": "In a graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. This is known as the Handshaking Lemma. Let's denote the number of edges as E.\n\nGiven the degrees of the vertices, we have:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + x = 2E\n\nSumming the degrees, we get:\n\n20 + x = 2E\n\nNow, we know that the maximum number of edges in a graph with n vertices is given by the formula:\n\nE_max = n(n-1)/2\n\nIn our case, n = 7, so:\n\nE_max = 7(6)/2 = 21\n\nSince the number of edges must be less than or equal to the maximum number of edges, we have:\n\n2E ≤ 42\n\nNow, we can find the possible values of x:\n\n20 + x ≤ 42\n\nx ≤ 22\n\nHowever, x must also be a non-negative integer, and the degree of a vertex cannot be greater than the number of other vertices in the graph (in this case, 6). Therefore, the possible values of x are:\n\n0 ≤ x ≤ 6\n\nIn conclusion, the possible values of x are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6."
