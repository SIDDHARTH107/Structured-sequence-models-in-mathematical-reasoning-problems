The payoff matrix is given as:\n\n```\n             Opponent\n            1     2     3\n      1   10,10   2,7   0,0\nYou   2    7,2  6,6.5   5,5   \n      3    0,0   5,5  7.5,2\n```\n  \nIf the student plays strategy 2, what is the probability that the opponent will also play strategy 2?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that the opponent will also play strategy 2, we need to analyze the opponent's payoffs for each strategy when the student plays strategy 2. The opponent's payoffs are:\n\nStrategy 1: 2\nStrategy 2: 6.5\nStrategy 3: 5\n\nAssuming the opponent chooses their strategy based on the highest payoff, they will choose strategy 2 with a payoff of 6.5. However, without information on the opponent's decision-making process or any probabilities assigned to their strategy choices, we cannot determine an exact probability that the opponent will also play strategy 2."
