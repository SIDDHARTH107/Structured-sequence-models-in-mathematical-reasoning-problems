    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = 2e^(-3x) cos(5x), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nHere, f(x) = 2e^(-3x) cos(5x) and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nSo, F(ω) = ∫[2e^(-3x) cos(5x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, let's combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(ω) = 2∫[e^(-3x - iωx) cos(5x)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nF(ω) = 2∫[e^(-x(3 + iω)) cos(5x)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = e^(-x(3 + iω)) and dv = cos(5x) dx.\n\nThen, du = (-3 - iω)e^(-x(3 + iω)) dx and v = 1/5 sin(5x).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu, we get:\n\nF(ω) = 2{[e^(-x(3 + iω)) * 1/5 sin(5x)] from -∞ to ∞ - ∫[1/5 sin(5x) * (-3 - iω)e^(-x(3 + iω))] dx from -∞ to ∞}\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral. Since the function is complex, we can use the complex version of integration by parts again. Let u = 1/5 sin(5x) and dv = (-3 - iω)e^(-x(3 + iω)) dx.\n\nThen, du = cos(5x) dx and v = 1/(3 + iω)^2 e^(-x(3 + iω)).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula again, we get:\n\nF(ω) = 2{[e^(-x(3 + iω)) * 1/5 sin(5x)] from -∞ to ∞ - [1/5 sin(5x) * 1/(3 + iω)^2 e^(-x(3 + iω))] from -∞ to ∞ + ∫[cos(5x) * 1/(3 + iω)^2 e^(-x(3 + iω))] dx from -∞ to ∞}\n\nNow, we have to evaluate the limits of the integrals. Since the exponential term e^(-x(3 + iω)) goes to zero as x goes to infinity, the first and second terms in the curly brackets will be zero.\n\nSo, we are left with:\n\nF(ω) = 2∫[cos(5x) * 1/(3 + iω)^2 e^(-x(3 + iω))] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral is not easy to solve analytically. However, you can use numerical methods or software like Mathematica or MATLAB to find the Fourier transform of the given function for specific values of ω."
