    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z = -i, we first need to factor the denominator and find the order of the pole.\n\nThe denominator is z^3 + 1. We can factor this using the sum of cubes formula:\n\nz^3 + 1 = (z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1)\n\nNow we can see that the pole z = -i is a simple pole, since (z + 1) has a single root at z = -i. \n\nNext, we need to find the residue of the function at z = -i. Since it's a simple pole, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = lim (z -> -i) [(z + i) * f(z)]\n\nLet's plug in f(z) and simplify:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = lim (z -> -i) [(z + i) * (z^2 + 2z + 3) / ((z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1))]\n\nThe (z + i) term in the numerator cancels out the (z + 1) term in the denominator:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = lim (z -> -i) [(z^2 + 2z + 3) / (z^2 - z + 1)]\n\nNow we can substitute z = -i into the expression:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = ((-i)^2 + 2(-i) + 3) / ((-i)^2 - (-i) + 1)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = ((-1 - 2i + 3) / (1 + i + 1))\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = (1 - 2i) / (2 + i)\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = (1 - 2i)(2 - i) / (2 + i)(2 - i)\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = (2 - i - 4i + 2i^2) / (4 - 2i^2)\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = (2 - i - 4i - 2) / (4 + 2)\n\nRes[f(z), z = -i] = (-5i) / 6\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z = -i is -5i/6."
