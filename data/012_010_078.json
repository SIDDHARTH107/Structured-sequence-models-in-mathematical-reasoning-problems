    "message_2": "A vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest possible vertex cover for the given graph G with 7 vertices and 12 edges.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph. By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nÎ£(deg(v)) = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nSince there are 7 vertices, the maximum possible degree for a vertex is 6 (if it is connected to every other vertex). However, this would result in a total degree sum of 6 * 7 = 42, which is greater than 24. Therefore, the maximum degree of a vertex in G must be less than 6.\n\nNow, let's consider a vertex with degree 5. If we include this vertex in the vertex cover, we can cover 5 edges. To cover the remaining 7 edges, we need at least 3 more vertices (since each vertex can cover at most 2 of the remaining edges). So, a vertex cover with a vertex of degree 5 requires at least 4 vertices.\n\nIf the graph has no vertex with degree 5 or higher, then the maximum degree is 4. In this case, we can use the following construction:\n\n1. Create a complete bipartite graph K(3,4) with 3 vertices in one partition and 4 vertices in the other partition. This graph has 3 * 4 = 12 edges.\n2. The vertex cover of K(3,4) is the set of vertices in the larger partition, which has 4 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible vertex cover of G has 4 vertices."
