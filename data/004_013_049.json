    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the given interval, we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of f(x) and setting it equal to 0.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 20\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 20 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 20/3 = 0\n\nNow, we use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (6 ± √(6^2 - 4(1)(20/3))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 80/3)) / 2\n\nx ≈ 2.1547, 3.8453\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f(x) at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval [0, 8]:\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 9(0)^2 + 20(0) + 6 = 6\nf(2.1547) ≈ 2.1547^3 - 9(2.1547)^2 + 20(2.1547) + 6 ≈ 22.4256\nf(3.8453) ≈ 3.8453^3 - 9(3.8453)^2 + 20(3.8453) + 6 ≈ 22.4256\nf(8) = 8^3 - 9(8)^2 + 20(8) + 6 = -58\n\nFrom these values, we can see that the maximum value of f(x) in the interval [0, 8] is approximately 22.4256, and the minimum value is -58."
