    "message_1": "A janitor can clean a cafeteria in 1 hour. If it takes 2 janitors to clean 3 cafeterias, how many hours will it take for 5 janitors to clean 8 cafeterias assuming they work at the same rate as the first janitor?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find out how long it takes for 1 janitor to clean 1 cafeteria. According to the problem, it takes 1 janitor 1 hour to clean 1 cafeteria.\n\nNow, let's see how much work 2 janitors can do in 1 hour. Since it takes 2 janitors to clean 3 cafeterias, they can clean 3/2 = 1.5 cafeterias in 1 hour.\n\nSince 5 janitors work at the same rate as the first janitor, each janitor can clean 1.5 cafeterias in 1 hour. Therefore, 5 janitors can clean 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 cafeterias in 1 hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours it will take for 5 janitors to clean 8 cafeterias. We can set up a proportion:\n\n(5 janitors) / (7.5 cafeterias) = (x hours) / (8 cafeterias)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n5 * 8 = 7.5 * x\n40 = 7.5x\nx = 40 / 7.5\nx â‰ˆ 5.33 hours\n\nSo, it will take approximately 5.33 hours for 5 janitors to clean 8 cafeterias."
