    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\n1. The graph is connected.\n2. The degrees of the vertices are as follows:\n   - A: degree 3 (odd)\n   - B: degree 4 (even)\n   - C: degree 3 (odd)\n   - D: degree 4 (even)\n   - E: degree 4 (even)\n   - F: degree 4 (even)\n\nThere are exactly 2 vertices with odd degree (A and C), so an Eulerian path exists in this graph.\n\nOne possible Eulerian path is: A-B-C-D-E-F-D-C-B-A"
