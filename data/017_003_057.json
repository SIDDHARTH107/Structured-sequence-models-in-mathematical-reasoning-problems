    "message_2": "To prove that G is a cyclic group, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince G is a group of order 7, we know that the number of elements in G is 7. Let's consider the element g in G, where g is not the identity element e. We will show that the powers of g generate the entire group G.\n\nFirst, we know that g^0 = e, which is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the powers of g: g^1, g^2, ..., g^6. We claim that all these powers are distinct, i.e., g^i ≠ g^j for i ≠ j where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 6.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist i and j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ 6) such that g^i = g^j. Then, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of g^i, which is (g^i)^(-1) = g^(-i):\n\ng^(-i)g^i = g^(-i)g^j\ng^(i - i) = g^(j - i)\ne = g^(j - i)\n\nThis means that g^(j - i) = e, which implies that the order of g divides (j - i). However, since 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 6, we have 1 ≤ (j - i) ≤ 5. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of g must divide the order of G, which is 7. Since 7 is a prime number, the only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7. The order of g cannot be 1, as g is not the identity element. Therefore, the order of g must be 7. But this contradicts the fact that the order of g divides (j - i), which is at most 5. This contradiction implies that our assumption that g^i = g^j for some i ≠ j is false. Hence, all the powers g^1, g^2, ..., g^6 are distinct.\n\nNow, we have shown that the powers of g generate 6 distinct elements in G, plus the identity element e. Since G has exactly 7 elements, this means that the powers of g generate the entire group G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group, generated by the element g."
