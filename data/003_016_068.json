    "message_2": "A sine wave function can be represented as:\n\ny = A * sin(B(x - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, we are given the amplitude A = 4 and the period is 6π. The period can be found using the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nSo, 6π = 2π / B\nB = 2π / 6π = 1/3\n\nNow, we know that the function passes through the origin (0, 0). We can plug this into the equation to find the phase shift (C).\n\n0 = 4 * sin((1/3)(0 - C))\n0 = sin(-C/3)\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, we have two possible values for -C/3: 0 and π. \n\nIf -C/3 = 0, then C = 0.\nIf -C/3 = π, then C = -3π.\n\nHowever, since the sine function is an odd function, sin(x) = -sin(-x). Therefore, a phase shift of -3π is equivalent to a phase shift of 0.\n\nSo, the phase shift C = 0."
