    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 3 -2  1 |  1 |\n| 2  1  2 | -2 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\n- Multiply the first row by -3 and add it to the second row.\n- Multiply the first row by -2 and add it to the third row.\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 0 -8  4 | -8 |\n| 0 -3  4 | -8 |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -8 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 0  1 -0.5 |  1 |\n| 0 -3  4 | -8 |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\n- Multiply the second row by 3 and add it to the third row.\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 0  1 -0.5 |  1 |\n| 0  0  0.5 | -5 |\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by 0.5 to get a leading 1 in the third row.\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3 |\n| 0  1 -0.5 |  1 |\n| 0  0  1 | -10 |\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\nz = -10\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\ny - 0.5z = 1\ny - 0.5(-10) = 1\ny + 5 = 1\ny = -4\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\nx + 2y - z = 3\nx + 2(-4) - (-10) = 3\nx - 8 + 10 = 3\nx + 2 = 3\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = -4, and z = -10."
