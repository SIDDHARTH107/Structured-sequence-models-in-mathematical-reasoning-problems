    "message_1": "A machine is used to fill cans of soda. The amount of soda dispensed into each can is normally distributed with a mean of 300 ml and a standard deviation of 5 ml. A sample of 25 cans is selected. \n\nWhat is the 90% confidence interval for the mean amount of soda dispensed into each can?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the mean amount of soda dispensed into each can, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Z-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nGiven:\nMean (μ) = 300 ml\nStandard Deviation (σ) = 5 ml\nSample Size (n) = 25 cans\n\nFor a 90% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.645 (you can find this value in a standard Z-score table).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 300 ± (1.645 * (5 / √25))\nConfidence Interval = 300 ± (1.645 * (5 / 5))\nConfidence Interval = 300 ± (1.645 * 1)\n\nConfidence Interval = (300 - 1.645, 300 + 1.645)\nConfidence Interval = (298.355, 301.645)\n\nThus, the 90% confidence interval for the mean amount of soda dispensed into each can is approximately (298.355 ml, 301.645 ml)."
