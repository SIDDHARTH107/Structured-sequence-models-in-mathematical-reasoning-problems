    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say H, of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have that n_3 divides the order of G and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which is H. Since H is a subgroup of G and has the same order as G, we have that H = G. Thus, G is a p-group of order 3^3, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z_27, Z_9 x Z_3, or Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_3. Since G is of order 27, it cannot be isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_3. Therefore, G is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_27) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (isomorphic to Z_9 x Z_3).\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIn this case, there are three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let H_1, H_2, and H_3 be these subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have that |H_1 ∩ H_2| = 1 for i ≠ j. Now, consider the product of two elements from different subgroups, say a ∈ H_1 and b ∈ H_2. Since a and b are not in the same subgroup, the order of ab cannot be 3 (otherwise, they would generate a cyclic subgroup of order 3, which would contradict the fact that H_1 and H_2 are distinct). Thus, the order of ab must be 9.\n\nLet K be the subgroup generated by ab. Since the order of ab is 9, we have that |K| = 9. Now, consider the subgroup H_1K. Since H_1 and K are both subgroups of G, we have that |H_1K| = |H_1||K|/|H_1 ∩ K|. Since |H_1| = 3 and |K| = 9, we get that |H_1K| = 27. Thus, H_1K = G.\n\nNow, we claim that H_1 ∩ K is trivial. Suppose for contradiction that there exists an element x ∈ H_1 ∩ K with order 3. Since x ∈ K, there exist elements a ∈ H_1 and b ∈ H_2 such that x = a^i * b^j for some i, j. Then, x^3 = (a^i * b^j)^3 = a^(3i) * b^(3j) = e (since x has order 3). But this implies that a^(3i) = b^(-3j), which means that a^(3i) ∈ H_1 ∩ H_2, a contradiction since the intersection is trivial. Thus, H_1 ∩ K is trivial.\n\nWe have shown that G = H_1K and H_1 ∩ K is trivial. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H_1 and K, which are cyclic groups of order 3 and 9, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is cyclic (isomorphic to Z_27) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (isomorphic to Z_9 x Z_3)."
