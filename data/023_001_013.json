    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series expansion of the given periodic function f(x), we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n. The general form of the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) = 2 for 0 < x < π and f(x + π) = -2 for -π < x < 0, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫(2)dx from 0 to π + ∫(-2)dx from -π to 0]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [2x | from 0 to π - 2x | from -π to 0]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [2π - 0] = 2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(2 * cos(n * x))dx from 0 to π + ∫(-2 * cos(n * x))dx from -π to 0]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(2/n) * sin(n * x) | from 0 to π - (-2/n) * sin(n * x) | from -π to 0]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(2/n) * (sin(n * π) - sin(0)) + (2/n) * (sin(0) - sin(-n * π))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, a_n = 0.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(2 * sin(n * x))dx from 0 to π + ∫(-2 * sin(n * x))dx from -π to 0]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * cos(n * x) | from 0 to π - (2/n) * cos(n * x) | from -π to 0]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(0)) + (2/n) * (cos(0) - cos(-n * π))]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (cos(n * π) - 1) + (2/n) * (1 - cos(n * π))]\n\nb_n = (4/n) * (1 - cos(n * π)) / π\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series expansion of f(x):\n\nf(x) = 2 + Σ[(4/n) * (1 - cos(n * π)) * sin(n * x) / π] for n = 1 to infinity\n\nThis is the Fourier series expansion of the given periodic function f(x)."
