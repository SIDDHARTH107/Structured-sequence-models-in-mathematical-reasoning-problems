    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of winning exactly k matches\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of matches (in this case, 5)\n- k is the number of matches the team wins (in this case, 3)\n- p is the probability of winning a single match (in this case, 0.6)\n- (1-p) is the probability of losing a single match (in this case, 0.4)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(5, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 matches to win out of 5:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\n         = 5! / (3! * 2!)\n         = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n         = 120 / (6 * 2)\n         = 10\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(5-3)\n         = 10 * (0.6)^3 * (0.4)^2\n         = 10 * 0.216 * 0.16\n         = 10 * 0.03456\n         = 0.3456\n\nSo, the probability that the football team will win exactly 3 out of 5 matches is 0.3456 or 34.56%."
