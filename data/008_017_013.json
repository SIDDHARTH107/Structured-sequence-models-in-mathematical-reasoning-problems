The matrix form is AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 1 -2  1 |\n    | 4  5  2 |\n    | 2  3  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  4  |\n    | 14  |\n    | 10  |\n\nNow, we can use the scipy.sparse library in Python to solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.sparse import csc_matrix\nfrom scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve\n\nA = csc_matrix([[1, -2, 1], [4, 5, 2], [2, 3, 5]])\nB = csc_matrix([[4], [14], [10]])\n\nX = spsolve(A, B)\nprint(X)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the solution for X:\n\nx ≈ 1.0\ny ≈ 2.0\nz ≈ 1.0\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
