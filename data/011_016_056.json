    "message_1": "A company wants to launch a new product and needs to test it with a focus group of 12 people. The company wants to make sure that the group represents the diversity of the population in terms of age and gender. If there are 7 males and 8 females in the population, how many different designs are possible for the focus group to ensure at least 3 males and 3 females are represented?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations. We need to find the number of ways to select at least 3 males and 3 females from the given population to form a focus group of 12 people.\n\nFirst, let's consider the different possible compositions of the focus group:\n\n1. 3 males and 9 females\n2. 4 males and 8 females\n3. 5 males and 7 females\n4. 6 males and 6 females\n5. 7 males and 5 females\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of combinations for each composition:\n\n1. 3 males and 9 females: C(7,3) * C(8,9) = 35 * 0 = 0 (since we cannot select 9 females from a group of 8)\n2. 4 males and 8 females: C(7,4) * C(8,8) = 35 * 1 = 35\n3. 5 males and 7 females: C(7,5) * C(8,7) = 21 * 8 = 168\n4. 6 males and 6 females: C(7,6) * C(8,6) = 7 * 28 = 196\n5. 7 males and 5 females: C(7,7) * C(8,5) = 1 * 56 = 56\n\nNow, let's add up the combinations for each composition to find the total number of possible designs:\n\n0 + 35 + 168 + 196 + 56 = 455\n\nSo, there are 455 different designs possible for the focus group to ensure at least 3 males and 3 females are represented."
