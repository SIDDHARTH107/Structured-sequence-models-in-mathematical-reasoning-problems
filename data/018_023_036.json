    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B (symmetric difference between A and B). The symmetric difference between two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find A × B (Cartesian product of A and B). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, we can calculate the symmetric differences for both expressions:\n\n1.

The element 4 is not in A but is in (B △ A × B), so it is also included. The ordered pairs from A × B are not in A, so they are also included in the symmetric difference:\n\nA △ (B △ A × B) = {2, 3, 4, (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNote that the element 1 is not included in the final result because it is present in both A and (B △ A × B)."
