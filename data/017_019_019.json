    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 36. We know that 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, so by the Sylow theorems, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 ∈ {1, 3, 9} (where n_2 is the number of Sylow 2-subgroups)\n2. n_3 ∈ {1, 4} (where n_3 is the number of Sylow 3-subgroups)\n\nWe will analyze these possibilities and show that G must be isomorphic to either C36, A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are coprime, we have P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is C4 × C9. Since C4 × C9 is isomorphic to C36, we have our first possibility.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. Let Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since the index of the normalizer of Q in G is equal to n_3, we have [G : N_G(Q)] = 4. Thus, G has a subgroup H of order 9 that acts on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from H to the symmetric group S_4. The image of this homomorphism is a subgroup of S_4 isomorphic to either A4 or C3. If the image is isomorphic to A4, then G is isomorphic to A4 × C3. If the image is isomorphic to C3, then G is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. Let Q be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since the index of the normalizer of Q in G is equal to n_2, we have [G : N_G(Q)] = 3. Thus, G has a subgroup H of order 4 that acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from H to the symmetric group S_3. The image of this homomorphism is a subgroup of S_3 isomorphic to either A3 or C2. In either case, G is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. This case leads to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
