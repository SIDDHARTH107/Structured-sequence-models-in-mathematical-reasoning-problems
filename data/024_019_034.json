    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem is used to find the total curvature of a closed surface, which is a surface without any boundary. However, the given shape is a rectangular parallelogram, which is a flat, open surface with a boundary. Therefore, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem cannot be applied to this problem.\n\nHowever, we can still discuss the curvature of this surface. Since it is a flat, planar surface, its Gaussian curvature is 0."
