    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |x| on the interval -π < x < π, we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nSince f(x) is an even function (f(-x) = f(x)), the Fourier series will only have cosine terms. Therefore, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nThe Fourier series of f(x) can be written as:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier coefficients a_n:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) = |x|, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫(-x)dx from -π to 0 + ∫x dx from 0 to π]\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(-x * cos(nx))dx from -π to 0 + ∫(x * cos(nx))dx from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-x^2/2)|(-π to 0) + (x^2/2)|(0 to π)] = (1/π) * [π^2/2 + π^2/2] = π\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(-x * cos(nx))dx from -π to 0 + ∫(x * cos(nx))dx from 0 to π]\n\nTo solve the integrals, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = cos(nx)dx, then du = dx and v = (1/n) * sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\na_n = (1/π) * {[(x/n) * sin(nx)|(-π to 0) - ∫(sin(nx)/n)dx from -π to 0] + [(x/n) * sin(nx)|(0 to π) - ∫(sin(nx)/n)dx from 0 to π]}\n\nNow, we can solve the remaining integrals:\n\na_n = (1/π) * {[(x/n) * sin(nx)|(-π to 0) + (x/n) * sin(nx)|(0 to π) - (1/n^2) * [-cos(nx)|(-π to 0) + cos(nx)|(0 to π)]}\n\na_n = (1/π) * {0 - (1/n^2) * [-2cos(nπ) + 2]}\n\na_n = (1/π) * (2/n^2) * [1 - cos(nπ)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series of f(x) = |x|:\n\nf(x) = π/2 + Σ[(1/π) * (2/n^2) * [1 - cos(nπ)] * cos(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
