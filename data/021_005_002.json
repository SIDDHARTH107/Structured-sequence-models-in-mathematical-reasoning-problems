    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(t, y) representing the differential equation y' = -2y + 4.\n2. Set the initial values t0 = 0, y0 = 1, and the step size h = 0.1.\n3. Apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method iteratively to approximate the solution at each step.\n\nThe function f(t, y) is given by:\n\nf(t, y) = -2y + 4\n\nNow, let's apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\nFor each step from t0 to t1 (t1 = 1) with a step size of h = 0.1, we will calculate the following values:\n\nk1 = h * f(t, y)\nk2 = h * f(t + h/2, y + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(t + h/2, y + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(t + h, y + k3)\n\nThen, update the values of t and y as follows:\n\ny_new = y + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\nt_new = t + h\n\nIterating through the steps:\n\nStep 1: t0 = 0, y0 = 1\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0, 1) = 0.1 * (-2*1 + 4) = 0.2\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.05, 1.1) = 0.1 * (-2*1.1 + 4) = 0.19\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.05, 1.095) = 0.1 * (-2*1.095 + 4) = 0.181\nk4 = 0.1 * f(0.1, 1.081) = 0.1 * (-2*1.081 + 4) = 0.1638\n\ny1 = 1 + (0.2 + 2*0.19 + 2*0.181 + 0.1638) / 6 = 1.1643\nt1 = 0 + 0.1 = 0.1\n\nStep 2: t1 = 0.1, y1 = 1.1643\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0.1, 1.1643) = 0.1 * (-2*1.1643 + 4) = 0.1274\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.15, 1.2279) = 0.1 * (-2*1.2279 + 4) = 0.109\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.15, 1.2191) = 0.1 * (-2*1.2191 + 4) = 0.0962\nk4 = 0.1 * f(0.2, 1.2051) = 0.1 * (-2*1.2051 + 4) = 0.0758\n\ny2 = 1.1643 + (0.1274 + 2*0.109 + 2*0.0962 + 0.0758) / 6 = 1.2837\nt2 = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2\n\nStep 3: t2 = 0.2, y2 = 1.2837\n(Continue this process for the remaining steps)\n\nAfter completing all the steps, we will have the approximate solution of the given initial value problem at each step on the interval [0, 1] with a step size of 0.1."
