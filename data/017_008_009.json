Trivial subgroup: {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\n2. Subgroups of order 2: By Cauchy's theorem, there must be an element of order 2 in G. Let a be an element of order 2, then the subgroup generated by a is {e, a}. There could be more subgroups of order 2 depending on the structure of G.\n\n3. Subgroups of order 4: By Sylow's theorem, there must be a subgroup of order 4 in G. Let H be a subgroup of order 4. H can be cyclic or not. If H is cyclic, it is generated by an element of order 4, say b. So H = {e, b, b^2, b^3}. If H is not cyclic, it must be isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which has three elements of order 2. In this case, H = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c are distinct elements of order 2.\n\n4. The whole group G: G itself is a subgroup of order 8.\n\nNow, let's determine which of these subgroups are isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4.\n\n- C8: A group isomorphic to C8 must be of order 8 and cyclic. If G is cyclic, it is generated by an element of order 8, say g. So G = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7} is isomorphic to C8.\n\n- Q8: A group isomorphic to Q8 must be of order 8 and have the following presentation: Q8 = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, where i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. If G has this structure, then G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\n- D4: A group isomorphic to D4 must be of order 8 and have the following presentation: D4 = {r^n s^m | n = 0, 1, 2, 3; m = 0, 1}, where r has order 4, s has order 2, and srs = r^(-1). If G has this structure, then G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nIn summary, we have found the following subgroups of G: the trivial subgroup, subgroups of order 2, subgroups of order 4, and the whole group G. Depending on the structure of G, it can be isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4."
