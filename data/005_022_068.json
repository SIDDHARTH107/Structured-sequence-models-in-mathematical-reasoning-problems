    "message_1": "A study of the height of 10 randomly selected students in a class had the following measurements:\n\n152 cm, 156 cm, 153 cm, 154 cm, 152 cm, 160 cm, 155 cm, 157 cm, 156 cm, 170 cm\n\nCalculate the median, interquartile range, and the outlier cutoff for this height data set using the Tukey's method for outliers.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n152 cm, 152 cm, 153 cm, 154 cm, 155 cm, 156 cm, 156 cm, 157 cm, 160 cm, 170 cm\n\n1. Median:\nSince there are 10 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the 5th and 6th values.\n\nMedian = (155 + 156) / 2 = 155.5 cm\n\n2. Interquartile Range (IQR):\nTo calculate the IQR, we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (not including the overall median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, Q1 is the median of 152, 152, 153, and 154.\n\nQ1 = (152 + 153) / 2 = 152.5 cm\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (not including the overall median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, Q3 is the median of 156, 156, 157, and 160.\n\nQ3 = (156 + 157) / 2 = 156.5 cm\n\nNow we can calculate the IQR:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 156.5 - 152.5 = 4 cm\n\n3. Outlier Cutoff using Tukey's Method:\nTukey's method defines outliers as data points that are below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR.\n\nLower cutoff = Q1 - 1.5*IQR = 152.5 - 1.5*4 = 146 cm\nUpper cutoff = Q3 + 1.5*IQR = 156.5 + 1.5*4 = 163 cm\n\nSo, any data point below 146 cm or above 163 cm would be considered an outlier using Tukey's method. In this data set, there is one outlier: 170 cm."
