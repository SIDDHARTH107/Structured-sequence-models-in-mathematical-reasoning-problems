    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the cylinder?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the height (h) is 10 cm and the radius (r) is 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(4)² + 2π(4)(10)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(16) + 2π(40)\n\nSurface Area = 32π + 80π\n\nSurface Area = 112π\n\nNow, we can multiply by the value of π (approximately 3.14159):\n\nSurface Area ≈ 112 * 3.14159\n\nSurface Area ≈ 351.8584 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 351.86 cm²."
