    "message_1": "A company has reported that there is a 3% chance of financial fraud occurring in a given year. What is the probability that in a group of 50 randomly selected companies, at least one company reports financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability approach. Instead of finding the probability of at least one company reporting financial fraud, we will find the probability of none of the companies reporting financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a company not reporting financial fraud in a given year is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nFor 50 randomly selected companies, the probability that none of them report financial fraud is (0.97)^50.\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one company reporting financial fraud:\n\n1 - (0.97)^50 â‰ˆ 0.7854\n\nSo, the probability that at least one company in a group of 50 randomly selected companies reports financial fraud is approximately 78.54%."
