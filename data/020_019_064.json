    "message_1": "A missile is launched from a submarine located 1000 meters away from the coast. The missile needs to hit a target located 5000 meters away from the coast that is moving at a constant speed of 30 meters per second. The missile's speed is 150 meters per second, and it can change course at a maximum of 1 degree per second. What is the optimal control strategy to ensure the missile reaches the target in the shortest time possible?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control strategy, we can use the concept of pursuit curves, specifically the pure pursuit strategy. In this strategy, the missile will always head directly towards the target's current position, adjusting its course as the target moves.\n\nLet's denote the missile's position as M(t) and the target's position as T(t). At any given time t, the missile should adjust its course to head directly towards T(t). Since the missile can change its course at a maximum of 1 degree per second, it should do so if the angle between its current heading and the direction towards T(t) is greater than 1 degree.\n\nTo implement this strategy, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial positions of the missile and target: M(0) = (0, 1000) and T(0) = (0, 5000).\n\n2. At each time step t, calculate the target's new position: T(t) = (30t, 5000).\n\n3. Calculate the direction vector from M(t) to T(t): D(t) = T(t) - M(t).\n\n4. Calculate the angle θ(t) between the missile's current heading and D(t). If θ(t) > 1 degree, adjust the missile's heading by 1 degree towards D(t).\n\n5. Update the missile's position based on its speed and heading: M(t+1) = M(t) + 150 * unit_vector(heading).\n\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the distance between M(t) and T(t) is sufficiently small, indicating a successful hit.\n\nBy always heading directly towards the target's current position and adjusting its course as needed, the missile will follow a pursuit curve that minimizes the time to intercept the target."
