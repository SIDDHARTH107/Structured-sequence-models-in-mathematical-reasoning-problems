    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nTo find the largest clique in the given graph, we can start by identifying all the cliques and then determine the largest one.\n\n1. Vertices 1, 2, and 3 form a clique: (1-2), (1-3), (2-3)\n2. Vertices 2, 3, and 4 form a clique: (2-3), (2-4), (3-4)\n3. Vertices 3, 4, and 5 form a clique: (3-4), (3-5), (4-5)\n4. Vertices 5, 6, and 7 form a clique: (5-6), (5-7), (6-7)\n5. Vertices 6, 7, and 8 form a clique: (6-7), (6-8), (7-8)\n\nAll the identified cliques have a size of 3. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
