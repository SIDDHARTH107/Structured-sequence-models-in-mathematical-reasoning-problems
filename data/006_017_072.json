    "message_1": "In a certain town, the probability that a traffic accident on a specific road involves only one car is 0.6, and the probability that it involves more than one car is 0.4. If there are a total of 10 traffic accidents on the road in a given week, what is the probability that at least 5 of them involve only one car?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 of the 10 accidents involve only one car, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the total number of trials (accidents), k is the number of successful trials (accidents involving only one car), p is the probability of success (0.6), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 5 accidents involve only one car, we need to calculate the probabilities for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 accidents involving only one car and then sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = (10 choose 5) * 0.6^5 * 0.4^5\nP(X = 6) = (10 choose 6) * 0.6^6 * 0.4^4\nP(X = 7) = (10 choose 7) * 0.6^7 * 0.4^3\nP(X = 8) = (10 choose 8) * 0.6^8 * 0.4^2\nP(X = 9) = (10 choose 9) * 0.6^9 * 0.4^1\nP(X = 10) = (10 choose 10) * 0.6^10 * 0.4^0\n\nNow, we calculate each probability:\n\nP(X = 5) = 252 * 0.07776 * 0.01024 ≈ 0.200658\nP(X = 6) = 210 * 0.046656 * 0.0256 ≈ 0.250823\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.0279936 * 0.064 ≈ 0.215086\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.01679616 * 0.16 ≈ 0.121213\nP(X = 9) = 10 * 0.010077696 * 0.4 ≈ 0.040311\nP(X = 10) = 1 * 0.006046618 * 1 ≈ 0.006047\n\nFinally, we sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 0.200658 + 0.250823 + 0.215086 + 0.121213 + 0.040311 + 0.006047 ≈ 0.834138\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 of the 10 traffic accidents involve only one car is approximately 0.834 or 83.4%."
