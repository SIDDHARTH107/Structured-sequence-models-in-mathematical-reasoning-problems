    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of triangles we need to subdivide each face into as n. After subdividing each face into n triangles, we will obtain a new tetrahedron composed of smaller tetrahedra. \n\nWhen we subdivide each face into n triangles, we are essentially adding n-1 new vertices on each edge of the original tetrahedron. These new vertices, along with the 4 original vertices, will form the vertices of the smaller tetrahedra.\n\nThe total number of vertices in the subdivided tetrahedron can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal vertices = (n-1) * 6 edges + 4 original vertices\n\nNow, let's consider the number of smaller tetrahedra formed. Each smaller tetrahedron has 4 vertices. Since there are 4 faces in the original tetrahedron, and each face is subdivided into n triangles, we can calculate the total number of smaller tetrahedra as follows:\n\nTotal smaller tetrahedra = 4 faces * n triangles per face\n\nWe are given that there are 27 smaller tetrahedra in the subdivided tetrahedron. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n4 faces * n triangles per face = 27 smaller tetrahedra\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn = 27 / 4\nn = 6.75\n\nHowever, n must be an integer value, as we cannot subdivide a face into a fraction of a triangle. Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer value of n that satisfies the equation. The smallest integer value greater than 6.75 is 7.\n\nSo, we need to subdivide each face of the tetrahedron into 7 triangles to obtain a subdivided tetrahedron with 27 smaller tetrahedra."
