    "message_1": "What is the period of a Duffing oscillator with the following parameters:\n- Mass: 1 kg\n- Spring constant: 4 N/m\n- Damping coefficient: 0.2 Ns/m\n- Nonlinearity coefficient: 0.1 N/m^3\n- Amplitude: 0.5 m\n- Initial displacement: 0.2 m\n\nRound your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The period of a Duffing oscillator cannot be determined analytically due to its nonlinear nature. However, we can approximate the period using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method or by simulating the system using software like MATLAB or Python.\n\nFor a more accurate answer, I would recommend using a numerical method or simulation software to solve the Duffing oscillator equation with the given parameters."
