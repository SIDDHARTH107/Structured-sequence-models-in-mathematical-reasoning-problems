    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of fireflies. The algorithm is based on the flashing patterns and behavior of fireflies, which are used to attract other fireflies and move towards the brighter ones. In the context of optimization problems, the brightness of a firefly is associated with the objective function value.\n\nTo apply the firefly algorithm to the given optimization problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 20 fireflies with random positions (x values) within the feasible region (x >= 0).\n2. Define the objective function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5.\n3. Calculate the brightness (objective function value) of each firefly.\n4. Set the maximum number of iterations to 50 and the attractiveness parameter alpha to 0.5.\n5. Perform the firefly algorithm iterations:\n\n   a. For each firefly, compare its brightness with the brightness of all other fireflies.\n   b. If a firefly is less bright than another firefly, move towards the brighter one using the attractiveness formula.\n   c. Update the position of the firefly based on the movement.\n   d. Ensure the updated position is within the feasible region (x >= 0).\n   e. Update the brightness of the firefly based on the new position.\n   f. Repeat steps a-e for all fireflies.\n   g. Repeat steps a-f for the maximum number of iterations (50).\n\n6. After completing the iterations, find the firefly with the highest brightness (lowest objective function value), which represents the optimal solution.\n\nDue to the random nature of the firefly algorithm, it is not possible to provide a specific numerical solution without running the algorithm. However, by following these steps, you can implement the firefly algorithm to find the minimum value of f(x) and the value of x that achieves that minimum for the given optimization problem."
