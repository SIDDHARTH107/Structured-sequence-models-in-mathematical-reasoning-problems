    "message_2": "To show that $E$ is isomorphic to the Möbius band, we will construct an isomorphism between $E$ and the Möbius band $M$. Recall that the Möbius band can be constructed as the quotient space $M = [0, 1] \\times \\mathbb{R} / \\sim$, where $(0, t) \\sim (1, -t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nFirst, we will construct a continuous map $f: S^1 \\to M$ such that for each $x \\in S^1$, $f(x) \\in E_x$. Let $x \\in S^1$ be a point on the unit circle, and let $v_x \\in E_x$ be a non-zero vector in the fiber over $x$. Since $E_x$ is one-dimensional, we can normalize $v_x$ to have length 1. Define $f(x) = [v_x]$, where $[v_x]$ is the equivalence class of $v_x$ in the Möbius band. This map is well-defined, since if $v_x$ and $w_x$ are two non-zero vectors in $E_x$, then there exists a scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $w_x = cv_x$. Since $v_x$ and $w_x$ have the same length, we have $c = \\pm 1$, and thus $[v_x] = [w_x]$.\n\nNext, we will show that $f$ is continuous. Let $x_n \\in S^1$ be a sequence of points converging to $x \\in S^1$. Since $E$ is a vector bundle, the fibers $E_{x_n}$ and $E_x$ are homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, we can choose a sequence of non-zero vectors $v_{x_n} \\in E_{x_n}$ such that $v_{x_n}$ converges to $v_x \\in E_x$. By the definition of the quotient topology, it suffices to show that the sequence $[v_{x_n}]$ converges to $[v_x]$ in $[0, 1] \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Since $v_{x_n}$ and $v_x$ have the same length, we have $[v_{x_n}] = (t_n, s_n)$ and $[v_x] = (t, s)$ for some sequences $t_n, s_n \\in [0, 1]$ and $t, s \\in [0, 1]$ such that $t_n \\to t$ and $s_n \\to s$. Thus, $[v_{x_n}] \\to [v_x]$ in $[0, 1] \\times \\mathbb{R}$, and $f$ is continuous.\n\nFinally, we will show that $f$ is a bundle isomorphism. Let $x \\in S^1$ be a point on the unit circle, and let $v_x \\in E_x$ be a non-zero vector in the fiber over $x$. Since $E_x$ is one-dimensional, the map $f_x: E_x \\to M_x$ given by $f_x(v_x) = [v_x]$ is a linear isomorphism between the fibers $E_x$ and $M_x$. Moreover, since $f$ is continuous, the map $f_x$ is continuous for each $x \\in S^1$. Thus, $f$ is a bundle isomorphism between $E$ and the Möbius band $M$."
