Find the maximum flow that can be sent from node A to node F.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node F, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, let's find an augmenting path from A to F: A -> C -> F. The minimum capacity along this path is 1 (edge A -> C). We update the residual capacities:\n\n```\n        A\n       / \\\n    3 /   \\ 0\n     /     \\\n    B       C\n   / \\     / \\\n 2/   \\5  /4  \\2\n /     \\ /     \\\nD       E       F\n\n```\n\n2. Next, let's find another augmenting path: A -> B -> E -> C -> F. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 (edge B -> E). We update the residual capacities:\n\n```\n        A\n       / \\\n    1 /   \\ 0\n     /     \\\n    B       C\n   / \\     / \\\n 2/   \\3  /6  \\2\n /     \\ /     \\\nD       E       F\n\n```\n\n3. Now, let's find another augmenting path: A -> B -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 1 (edge A -> B). We update the residual capacities:\n\n```\n        A\n       / \\\n    0 /   \\ 0\n     /     \\\n    B       C\n   / \\     / \\\n 1/   \\3  /6  \\2\n /     \\ /     \\\nD       E       F\n\n```\n\n4. Finally, let's find another augmenting path: B -> E -> C -> F. The minimum capacity along this path is 1 (edge E -> C). We update the residual capacities:\n\n```\n        A\n       / \\\n    0 /   \\ 0\n     /     \\\n    B       C\n   / \\     / \\\n 1/   \\2  /7  \\1\n /     \\ /     \\\nD       E       F\n\n```\n\nNow, we can't find any more augmenting paths from A to F. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows along the paths we found: 1 (A -> C -> F) + 2 (A -> B -> E -> C -> F) + 1 (A -> B -> D) + 1 (B -> E -> C -> F) = 5.\n\nSo, the maximum flow that can be sent from node A to node F is 5."
