    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine the like terms. Like terms are the terms with the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, we have:\n\n1. 2x² and 3x² (both are x² terms)\n2. 6x³ (the only x³ term)\n3. -9x (the only x term)\n4. -5 (the constant term)\n\nNow, let's combine the like terms:\n\n1. 2x² + 3x² = 5x²\n2. 6x³ (no other x³ terms to combine)\n3. -9x (no other x terms to combine)\n4. -5 (no other constant terms to combine)\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n6x³ + 5x² - 9x - 5"
