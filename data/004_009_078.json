    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x^2 + 3x\nv(x) = x^3 - 4x\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x)/dx = 4x + 3\nv'(x) = d(x^3 - 4x)/dx = 3x^2 - 4\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we can plug in the derivatives and original functions:\n\nf'(x) = (4x + 3)(x^3 - 4x) + (2x^2 + 3x)(3x^2 - 4)\n\nNow, we can expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^4 - 16x^2 + 3x^3 - 12x + 6x^4 - 8x^2 + 9x^3 - 12x\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 10x^4 + 12x^3 - 24x^2 - 24x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 10x^4 + 12x^3 - 24x^2 - 24x"
