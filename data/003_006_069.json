    "message_2": "To find the measure of each angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines first to find one angle, and then use the Law of Sines to find the other two angles.\n\nLet the triangle have vertices A, B, and C, with side lengths a = 7, b = 9, and c = 5, opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find angle A:\ncos(A) = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2 * b * c)\ncos(A) = (9^2 + 5^2 - 7^2) / (2 * 9 * 5)\ncos(A) = (81 + 25 - 49) / 90\ncos(A) = 57 / 90\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle A:\nA = arccos(57/90) ≈ 54.46°\n\nNext, we can use the Law of Sines to find angle B:\nsin(B) / b = sin(A) / a\nsin(B) = (b * sin(A)) / a\nsin(B) = (9 * sin(54.46°)) / 7\nsin(B) ≈ 0.9205\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle B:\nB = arcsin(0.9205) ≈ 66.93°\n\nFinally, we can find angle C by subtracting the sum of angles A and B from 180° (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°):\nC = 180° - (54.46° + 66.93°) ≈ 58.61°\n\nSo, the measures of the angles in the triangle are approximately:\nA ≈ 54.46°\nB ≈ 66.93°\nC ≈ 58.61°"
