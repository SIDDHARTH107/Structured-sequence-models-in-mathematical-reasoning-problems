Suppose f : X → D is a biholomorphic function, where D is the open unit disk in the complex plane. We want to find the image under f of the circle centered at x0 with radius r > 0, that is, we want to determine the set f(x0 + re^it : 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π).",
    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle under the biholomorphic function f, we can use the fact that f is conformal, meaning it preserves angles locally. Since f is biholomorphic, its inverse function f^(-1) is also holomorphic. \n\nLet C be the circle centered at x0 with radius r, i.e., C = {x0 + re^(it) : 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π}. We want to find the image of C under f, which is the set f(C) = {f(x0 + re^(it)) : 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π}.\n\nConsider the function g: D → X defined by g(z) = f^(-1)(z). Since f is biholomorphic, g is also holomorphic and bijective. Let y0 = f(x0) and let ρ = |g'(y0)|r. We claim that the image of C under f is the circle centered at y0 with radius ρ, i.e., f(C) = {y0 + ρe^(is) : 0 ≤ s ≤ 2π}.\n\nTo prove this claim, we will show that g maps the circle centered at y0 with radius ρ to the circle C. Let y = y0 + ρe^(is) for some s in [0, 2π]. Then, we have:\n\ng(y) = g(y0) + g'(y0)(y - y0) + o(|y - y0|)\n\nwhere o(|y - y0|) represents the higher-order terms that vanish as y approaches y0.\n\nNow, let z = y - y0 = ρe^(is). Then, we have:\n\ng(y) = g(y0) + g'(y0)z + o(|z|)\n\nSince g is the inverse of f, we have g(y0) = x0. Thus,\n\ng(y) = x0 + g'(y0)ρe^(is) + o(ρ)\n\nNow, we can see that the term g'(y0)ρe^(is) represents a circle centered at x0 with radius |g'(y0)|ρ. As ρ = |g'(y0)|r, this circle is indeed the circle C. The higher-order terms o(ρ) vanish as y approaches y0, so they do not affect the result.\n\nTherefore, the image of the circle C under the biholomorphic function f is the circle centered at y0 with radius ρ, i.e., f(C) = {y0 + ρe^(is) : 0 ≤ s ≤ 2π}."
