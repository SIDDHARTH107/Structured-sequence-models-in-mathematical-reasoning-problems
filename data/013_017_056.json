    "message_1": "Suppose there are two types of used cars: good quality and bad quality. The probability that a seller has a good quality car is 0.6 and the probability that they have a bad quality car is 0.4. If the value of a good quality car is $10,000 and the value of a bad quality car is $5,000, what price should a buyer offer to purchase a car without knowing whether it is a good or bad quality car in order to ensure that they do not pay more than the expected value of the car?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the car, we need to multiply the value of each type of car by its respective probability and then add the results together. \n\nExpected value = (probability of good quality car * value of good quality car) + (probability of bad quality car * value of bad quality car)\n\nExpected value = (0.6 * $10,000) + (0.4 * $5,000)\n\nExpected value = ($6,000) + ($2,000)\n\nExpected value = $8,000\n\nTherefore, the buyer should offer $8,000 to purchase a car without knowing whether it is a good or bad quality car in order to ensure that they do not pay more than the expected value of the car."
