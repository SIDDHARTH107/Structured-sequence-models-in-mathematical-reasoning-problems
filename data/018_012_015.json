    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}.\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∩ {1}. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. Since {1} contains only one element, which is not an ordered pair, there are no common elements between A × B and {1}. Therefore, (A × B) ∩ {1} = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNext, let's find {1} × A. The Cartesian product of {1} and A is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ {1} and b ∈ A. So, {1} × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2)}.\n\nNow, let's find (({1} × A) ∩ B). We want to find the intersection of the set {1} × A and the set B. Since B = {2, 3}, we can see that there is one common element between ({1} × A) and B, which is (1, 2). Therefore, (({1} × A) ∩ B) = {(1, 2)}.\n\nWe found that (A × B) ∩ {1} = ∅ and (({1} × A) ∩ B) = {(1, 2)}. Since these two sets are not equal, this demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
