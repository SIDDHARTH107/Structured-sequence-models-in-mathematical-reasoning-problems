Contract edge CD: The resulting graph G2 has the chromatic polynomial P(G2, k).\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of G is given by P(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k).\n\nNow, let's find the chromatic polynomials of G1 and G2.\n\nG1:\n```\n     C ----- A\n      |     | \\\n      |     |  \\\n      |     |   B\n      |     |  /\n      |     | /\n     E ----- F\n```\nG1 is a cycle of length 5. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length n is given by P(C_n, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1). In this case, n = 5, so P(G1, k) = (k-1)^5 + (-1)^5(k-1).\n\nG2:\n```\n     C ----- A\n      \\     | \\\n       \\    |  \\\n        \\   |   B\n         \\  |  /\n          \\ | /\n            F\n```\nG2 is a cycle of length 4. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length n is given by P(C_n, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1). In this case, n = 4, so P(G2, k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k) = [(k-1)^5 + (-1)^5(k-1)] - [(k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)]\n        = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4 + (k-1) - (k-1)\n        = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the graph G is P(G, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4."
