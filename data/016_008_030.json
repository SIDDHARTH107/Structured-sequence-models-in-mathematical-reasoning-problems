    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change after each iteration. It remains constant, regardless of the number of iterations. The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, N = 4 (each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments) and M = 3 (each segment is 1/3 the length of the original).\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the 5th iteration (or any iteration) is approximately 1.2619."
