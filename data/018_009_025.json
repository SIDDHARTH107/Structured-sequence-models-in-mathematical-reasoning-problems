    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × C:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × C = {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × C and A × (B × C):\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 3), 6), ((1, 4), 5), ((1, 4), 6), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 3), 6), ((2, 4), 5), ((2, 4), 6)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (3, 6)), (1, (4, 5)), (1, (4, 6)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (3, 6)), (2, (4, 5)), (2, (4, 6))}\n\nNow, we can see that the elements of (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are different in their structure. However, we can rewrite the elements of both sets in a more comparable form:\n\n(A × B) × C = {(1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6)}\n\nNow we can see that both sets have the same elements, so we can conclude that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C)."
