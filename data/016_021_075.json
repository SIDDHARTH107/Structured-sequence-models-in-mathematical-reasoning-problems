    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly replacing a straight line segment with a sequence of segments that form a triangular shape. After each iteration, the total length of the curve increases by a factor of 2.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the curve is 1 * 2 = 2 units.\nAfter the second iteration, the length of the curve is 2 * 2 = 4 units.\nAfter the third iteration, the length of the curve is 4 * 2 = 8 units.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of the curve is 8 * 2 = 16 units.\n\nSo, the total length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the fourth iteration is 16 units."
