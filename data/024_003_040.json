    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = 2x^2 + 3y^2 at the point (1,1), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nThe surface can be parametrized as follows:\nr(u, v) = (u, v, 2u^2 + 3v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\nr_u = (1, 0, 4u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 6v)\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 16u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 24uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 36v^2\n\nNow, we compute the second derivatives:\nr_uu = (0, 0, 4)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 6)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 12)\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\nL = r_uu • N = -4 / sqrt(1 + 16u^2 + 36v^2)\nM = r_uv • N = -6 / sqrt(1 + 16u^2 + 36v^2)\nN = r_vv • N = -12 / sqrt(1 + 16u^2 + 36v^2)\n\nFinally, we compute the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1):\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1):\nE = 17\nF = 24\nG = 37\nL = -4 / sqrt(53)\nM = -6 / sqrt(53)\nN = -12 / sqrt(53)\n\nK = ((-4 / sqrt(53)) * (-12 / sqrt(53)) - (-6 / sqrt(53))^2) / (17 * 37 - 24^2)\nK = (48 / 53 - 36 / 53) / (629 - 576)\nK = (12 / 53) / 53\nK = 12 / (53^2)\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = 2x^2 + 3y^2 at the point (1,1) is K = 12 / (53^2)."
