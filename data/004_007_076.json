    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1)^4 using the chain rule, we first identify the outer function and the inner function. In this case, the outer function is g(u) = u^4 and the inner function is h(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of the outer and inner functions:\n\ng'(u) = d(u^4)/du = 4u^3\nh'(x) = d(2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1)/dx = 6x^2 + 6x - 4\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x) = 4(2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1)^3 * (6x^2 + 6x - 4)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1)^4 with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 4(2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 1)^3 * (6x^2 + 6x - 4)"
