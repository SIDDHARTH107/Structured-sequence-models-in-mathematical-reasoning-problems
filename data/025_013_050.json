    "message_2": "The Jacobian of an elliptic curve is an abelian group that is associated with the curve. It is formed by the points on the curve along with a point at infinity, denoted as $\\mathcal{O}$. The group operation is defined by the addition law on the elliptic curve.\n\nGiven the elliptic curve $C: y^2 = x^3 + 4x - 4$, we can define the addition law on the curve as follows:\n\n1. For two distinct points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on the curve, the sum $P + Q = R = (x_3, y_3)$ is obtained by drawing a line through $P$ and $Q$. This line will intersect the curve at a third point, which we will call $R' = (x_3, -y_3)$. Then, $R$ is the reflection of $R'$ across the x-axis.\n\n2. If $P = Q$, draw the tangent line to the curve at $P$. This tangent line will intersect the curve at a point $R'$. Then, $R$ is the reflection of $R'$ across the x-axis.\n\n3. If $P$ and $Q$ are vertical, we define $P + Q = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\n4. If $P = \\mathcal{O}$ or $Q = \\mathcal{O}$, then $P + Q$ is the other point.\n\nNow, the Jacobian $J(C)$ of the elliptic curve $C$ is the set of all points on the curve, including the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$, with the group operation defined by the addition law described above.\n\nIn summary, the Jacobian $J(C)$ of the elliptic curve $C: y^2 = x^3 + 4x - 4$ is an abelian group consisting of the points on the curve and the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$, with the group operation defined by the addition law on the curve."
