    "message_2": "To solve the linear equation 3x + 7 = 16 for x, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation.\n3x + 7 - 7 = 16 - 7\n3x = 9\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3.\n(3x) / 3 = 9 / 3\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution for the linear equation is x = 3."
