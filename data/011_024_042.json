    "message_1": "A network of pipes carries water from a reservoir to a city. The reservoir has a capacity of 2000 liters and the city needs 1500 liters of water per day. If the network has a maximum flow of 1000 liters per day, how many days will it take to fill the city's water demand?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the city's water demand as D, the reservoir's capacity as R, and the network's maximum flow as F. We have:\n\nD = 1500 liters/day\nR = 2000 liters\nF = 1000 liters/day\n\nSince the network can only provide 1000 liters per day, it will take more than one day to fill the city's water demand. We can calculate the number of days needed to fill the city's water demand by dividing the demand by the network's maximum flow:\n\nNumber of days = D / F\nNumber of days = 1500 liters / 1000 liters/day\nNumber of days = 1.5 days\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take 2 days to fill the city's water demand."
