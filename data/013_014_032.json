The individuals have valuations of $30 and $40 for the good respectively. \n\nDesign a mechanism that allocates the good and collects payments from both individuals such that both individuals truthfully report their valuations and the mechanism is incentive compatible. \n\nWhat is the minimum amount that the individual with the lowest valuation needs to pay in order to receive the good in this mechanism?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to design a solution for this problem. The VCG mechanism is incentive compatible, meaning that it encourages truthful reporting of valuations.\n\nLet's denote the two individuals as A and B, with valuations v_A = $30 and v_B = $40. The total cost of the good is C = $50.\n\nIn the VCG mechanism, each individual pays the externality they impose on the other individual. The externality is the difference between the other individual's valuation and the cost of the good when the good is allocated to the other individual.\n\n1. If the good is allocated to A, then B's externality is v_B - C = $40 - $50 = -$10.\n2. If the good is allocated to B, then A's externality is v_A - C = $30 - $50 = -$20.\n\nSince the externalities are negative, we can set the payments to zero for both individuals. This means that the individual with the lowest valuation (A) does not need to pay anything to receive the good in this mechanism.\n\nHowever, this mechanism does not cover the cost of the good. To make it budget-balanced, we can introduce a subsidy of $50 to cover the cost. The mechanism remains incentive compatible, as both individuals still have an incentive to report their true valuations."
