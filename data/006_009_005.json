    "message_1": "In a population of 10,000 people, 2% have a certain medical condition. What is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population has the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "The probability that a randomly selected person from the population has the medical condition is 2%. This is because, out of 10,000 people, 2% have the medical condition. To calculate the probability, you can use the following formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of people with the medical condition) / (Total population)\n\nIn this case, the number of people with the medical condition is 2% of 10,000, which is:\n\n0.02 * 10,000 = 200 people\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\nProbability = 200 / 10,000 = 0.02 or 2%\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected person from the population has the medical condition is 2%."
