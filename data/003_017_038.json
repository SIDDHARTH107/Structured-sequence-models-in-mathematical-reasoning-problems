    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function on an interval [a, b], we use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 2sin(x), a = 0, and b = π. So, we have:\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] 2sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 2sin(x) from 0 to π:\n\n∫[0, π] 2sin(x) dx = [-2cos(x)] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n[-2cos(π)] - [-2cos(0)] = -2(-1) - (-2)(1) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nNow, plug this value back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 4 = 4/π\n\nSo, the exact value of the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) on the interval [0, π] is 4/π."
