The area will be given by the definite integral:\n\n$$A = \\int_{0}^{5} (4x - 9) dx$$\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\n$$\\int (4x - 9) dx = 2x^2 - 9x + C$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds $x = 0$ and $x = 5$:\n\n$$F(5) = 2(5)^2 - 9(5) = 50 - 45 = 5$$\n$$F(0) = 2(0)^2 - 9(0) = 0$$\n\nFinally, we subtract the lower bound value from the upper bound value to find the area:\n\n$$A = F(5) - F(0) = 5 - 0 = 5$$\n\nSo, the area bounded by the $x$-axis, the line $y = 4x - 9$, and the line $x = 5$ is 5 square units."
