    "message_2": "For a 45-degree angle, we can use the special right triangle with angles 45-45-90. In this triangle, the two legs are congruent, and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of each leg.\n\nLet's assume the length of each leg is 1 unit. Then, the hypotenuse will be √2 units.\n\nNow, we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for a 45-degree angle using the definitions of these trigonometric functions:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nsin(45°) = (opposite side) / hypotenuse = 1 / √2 = √2 / 2 (rationalizing the denominator)\n\n2. Cosine (cos) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\ncos(45°) = (adjacent side) / hypotenuse = 1 / √2 = √2 / 2 (rationalizing the denominator)\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles, the sine and cosine values are the same.\n\n3. Tangent (tan) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the adjacent side.\n\ntan(45°) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side) = 1 / 1 = 1\n\nSo, for a 45-degree angle, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios are:\n\nsin(45°) = cos(45°) = √2 / 2\ntan(45°) = 1"
