    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{32}$, we need to find the prime factorization of 32 and look for pairs of the same factors.\n\nThe prime factorization of 32 is $2^5$ (2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as $\\sqrt{2^5}$.\n\nFor every pair of the same factors, we can take one factor out of the square root. In this case, we have two pairs of 2's:\n\n$\\sqrt{2^5} = \\sqrt{(2^2)(2^2)(2)} = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is $4\\sqrt{2}$."
