    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, every subset of X is an open set, including the singletons {1}, {2}, and {3}. The closure of a set A is the smallest closed set containing A. In the discrete topology, every set is also closed, including the set A itself. Therefore, the closure of {1, 2} is simply {1, 2}."
