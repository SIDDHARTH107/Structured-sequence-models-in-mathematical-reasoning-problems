    "message_2": "To prove that the union of sets A and B is a superset of set A and a superset of set B, we need to show that every element in A and B is also in the union of A and B.\n\nLet's first find the union of sets A and B. The union of two sets is the set of all distinct elements from both sets. \n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1. Take any element x in A. We have three possibilities: x = 1, x = 3, or x = 5.\n2. If x = 1, then x is in A ∪ B since 1 is in the union.\n3. If x = 3, then x is in A ∪ B since 3 is in the union.\n4. If x = 5, then x is in A ∪ B since 5 is in the union.\n\nSince every element in A is also in A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n1. Take any element x in B. We have four possibilities: x = 2, x = 3, x = 4, or x = 5.\n2. If x = 2, then x is in A ∪ B since 2 is in the union.\n3. If x = 3, then x is in A ∪ B since 3 is in the union.\n4. If x = 4, then x is in A ∪ B since 4 is in the union.\n5. If x = 5, then x is in A ∪ B since 5 is in the union.\n\nSince every element in B is also in A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the union of sets A and B is a superset of set A and a superset of set B."
