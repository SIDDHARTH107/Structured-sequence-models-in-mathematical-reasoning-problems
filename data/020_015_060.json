    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard measuring 20 cm by 30 cm is to be cut to make a box with an open top by removing squares of equal size from each corner and folding up the sides. Find the length of the side of the square to be removed so that the volume of the box is maximum.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the side of the square to be removed from each corner. After removing the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 30 - 2x\nWidth: 20 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume of the box, V, can be expressed as the product of its dimensions:\n\nV(x) = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)(x)\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\n\nV(x) = 4x^3 - 100x^2 + 600x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of V(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nV'(x) = 12x^2 - 200x + 600\n\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic equation for x:\n\n12x^2 - 200x + 600 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 4 to simplify:\n\n3x^2 - 50x + 150 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (50 ± √(50²-4*3*150)) / (2*3)\n\nx ≈ 3.914 or x ≈ 12.753\n\nSince the length of the cardboard is 20 cm and the width is 30 cm, the value x = 12.753 is not possible because it would result in negative dimensions for the box. Therefore, the length of the side of the square to be removed for the maximum volume is approximately x ≈ 3.914 cm."
