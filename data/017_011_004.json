    "message_2": "First, let's consider the case where G has an element of order 12. Let a be an element of G with order 12. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted as ⟨a⟩, has 12 elements. Since G has 12 elements and ⟨a⟩ is a subgroup of G, we have that G = ⟨a⟩. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 12, and it is isomorphic to C12.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G does not have an element of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 2^2 = 4 and a subgroup of order 3. Let H be a subgroup of G with order 4, and let K be a subgroup of G with order 3. Since the order of H and K are coprime, by the Sylow theorems, we know that H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let's show that G has exactly three subgroups of order 2, each of which is cyclic. Since G has order 12, by Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 2. Let x be an element of order 2 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by x, denoted as ⟨x⟩, has order 2. Since G does not have an element of order 12, there must be at least one more element of order 2 in G. Let y be another element of order 2 in G, and let ⟨y⟩ be the cyclic subgroup generated by y. Since x and y are distinct elements of order 2, ⟨x⟩ and ⟨y⟩ are distinct subgroups of order 2.\n\nNow, consider the product xy. Since x and y have order 2, we have (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = e. Thus, xy has order 2. If xy = x or xy = y, then we would have y = x or y = e, respectively, which contradicts our assumption that x and y are distinct elements of order 2. Therefore, ⟨xy⟩ is a third distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n\nNow, we will show that there are no more subgroups of order 2. Suppose there is another element z of order 2 in G, and let ⟨z⟩ be the cyclic subgroup generated by z. Since G has order 12, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the action of G on the set of its subgroups of order 2 has an orbit of size 3. Thus, there exists an element g in G such that g⟨z⟩g^(-1) = ⟨x⟩, ⟨y⟩, or ⟨xy⟩. Without loss of generality, assume g⟨z⟩g^(-1) = ⟨x⟩. Then, gzg^(-1) = x, and z = g^(-1)xg. Since z has order 2, we have x = g^(-1)xg, which implies that x and z are conjugate elements. However, conjugate elements have the same order, so z must also have order 2. This contradicts our assumption that z is a distinct element of order 2, so there cannot be any more subgroups of order 2.\n\nNow, we will use the fact that G has exactly three subgroups of order 2 to prove that G is isomorphic to either A4 or D6. Since G has a subgroup of order 4 and a subgroup of order 3, we know that |G| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 4 * 3 = 12. Thus, G is a semidirect product of H and K, denoted as G = H ⋊ K.\n\nNow, we will consider the action of K on H by conjugation. Since K has order 3, the action of K on H either fixes all elements of H or has an orbit of size 3. If the action of K on H fixes all elements of H, then G is a direct product of H and K, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nIf the action of K on H has an orbit of size 3, then there exists an element k in K such that k⟨x⟩k^(-1) = ⟨y⟩ and k⟨y⟩k^(-1) = ⟨xy⟩ for some elements x, y in G with order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 12, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12. Otherwise, G has exactly three subgroups of order 2, each of which is cyclic, and G is isomorphic to either the alternating group A4 or the dihedral group D6."
