    "message_2": "To find the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we first note that the prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 36.\n\nLet G be a group of order 36. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G, and G is the direct product of P_2 and P_3. Since P_2 is of order 4, it can be isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2. P_3 is of order 9, so it is isomorphic to C9. Thus, we have two abelian groups in this case: C4 × C9 and (C2 × C2) × C9.\n\n2. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups of G. Then, |P_2| = 4, so P_2 can be isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2. Since P_3 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. For each isomorphism type of P_2, there are two possible actions of P_2 on P_3, giving a total of 2 * 2 = 4 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n3. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Then, |P_3| = 9, so P_3 is isomorphic to C9. Since P_2 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P_3 and P_2. For each isomorphism type of P_2, there is one possible action of P_3 on P_2, giving a total of 1 * 2 = 2 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has no normal Sylow subgroups. However, we can still form the semidirect product of a 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 and a 3-Sylow subgroup P_3. For each isomorphism type of P_2, there is one possible action of P_3 on P_2, giving a total of 1 * 2 = 2 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, we have found 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 non-abelian groups of order 36. However, we have missed one non-abelian group: the alternating group A4 × C3. This group is not a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups, so it was not counted in the cases above.\n\nNow, we will prove that every group of order 36 is isomorphic to one of these nine non-abelian groups, the cyclic group C36, or the alternating group A4 × C3.\n\nLet G be a group of order 36. By the Sylow theorems, G has either 1 or 3 2-Sylow subgroups and either 1 or 4 3-Sylow subgroups. We have already shown that for each combination of numbers of Sylow subgroups, there are specific groups that can be formed as direct or semidirect products of the Sylow subgroups. Thus, G must be isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\nIf G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to either C36, C4 × C9, or (C2 × C2) × C9. If G is non-abelian, then it must be isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups we found above. In either case, G is isomorphic to one of the groups we have listed."
