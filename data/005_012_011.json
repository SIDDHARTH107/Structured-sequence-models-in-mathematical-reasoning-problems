They decide to use simple random sampling. What is the minimum sample size they need to achieve this goal?\n\nNote: You can assume that the population standard deviation is unknown and the normal distribution can be approximated with the t-distribution.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum sample size needed for a simple random sample with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of $100, we can use the formula for the margin of error for a t-distribution:\n\nMargin of Error = (t * s) / sqrt(n)\n\nWhere:\n- Margin of Error is the desired margin of error ($100)\n- t is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95%)\n- s is the sample standard deviation\n- n is the sample size\n\nSince we don't know the population standard deviation, we will use the sample standard deviation (s) as an estimate. However, we don't have the sample standard deviation either, so we will use the conservative approach and assume that the standard deviation is half of the margin of error (s = $50).\n\nNow, we need to find the t-score for a 95% confidence level. Since we don't know the degrees of freedom (which depends on the sample size), we will use the t-score for a large sample size as an approximation. For a 95% confidence level, the t-score is approximately 1.96.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula and solve for the sample size (n):\n\n$100 = (1.96 * $50) / sqrt(n)\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn = ((1.96 * $50) / $100)^2\nn = (0.98)^2\nn = 0.9604\n\nSince we need a whole number for the sample size, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nn = 1\n\nHowever, a sample size of 1 is not sufficient for a meaningful estimation. In this case, we should increase the assumed standard deviation (s) and recalculate the sample size. Let's assume a standard deviation of $200:\n\n$100 = (1.96 * $200) / sqrt(n)\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn = ((1.96 * $200) / $100)^2\nn = (3.92)^2\nn = 15.3664\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\nn = 16\n\nSo, the minimum sample size needed to achieve the desired margin of error and confidence level is 16 employees."
