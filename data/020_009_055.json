    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in Stochastic Optimization:\n\nA company has two production machines, A and B, which produce the same item. The demand for the item varies between 200 and 400 units per day. The probability of demand being between 200 and 300 units is 0.6 and the probability of demand being between 300 and 400 units is 0.4. Machine A can produce 200 units per day with a probability of 0.6, while Machine B can produce 300 units per day with a probability of 0.7. If the company wants to maximize its daily production output, how many units should it produce using Machine A and how many using Machine B, and what is the expected value of the companyâ€™s daily production output?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the daily production output, the company should use both machines to their full capacity. That means Machine A should produce 200 units and Machine B should produce 300 units. \n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value of the company's daily production output. We'll consider the two demand scenarios: \n\n1. Demand between 200 and 300 units (probability = 0.6)\n2. Demand between 300 and 400 units (probability = 0.4)\n\nFor scenario 1, the company will be able to meet the demand using both machines. The expected production output for this scenario is:\n\nE1 = (200 * 0.6) + (300 * 0.7) = 120 + 210 = 330 units\n\nFor scenario 2, the company will not be able to meet the demand fully, as the combined production capacity of both machines is 500 units. The expected production output for this scenario is:\n\nE2 = (200 * 0.6) + (300 * 0.7) = 120 + 210 = 330 units\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall expected value of the company's daily production output:\n\nExpected Value = (E1 * P1) + (E2 * P2) = (330 * 0.6) + (330 * 0.4) = 198 + 132 = 330 units\n\nSo, the company should produce 200 units using Machine A and 300 units using Machine B, and the expected value of the company's daily production output is 330 units."
