    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nGiven A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {x, y}, let's find A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y), (3, x), (3, y)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB × A = {(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y), (3, x), (3, y)}\nB × A = {(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are not the same. For example, (1, x) is in A × B but not in B × A, and (x, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B. Therefore, A × B and B × A are not equal."
