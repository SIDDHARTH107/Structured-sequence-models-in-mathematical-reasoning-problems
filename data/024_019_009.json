    "message_2": "To compute the total geodesic curvature around a closed curve C that encloses an area of 4 square meters on a smooth surface S with a constant Gaussian curvature of 3, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that:\n\n∮C κ_g ds + ∬A K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere κ_g is the geodesic curvature, K is the Gaussian curvature, A is the area enclosed by the curve C, and χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface S.\n\nSince the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 3, we can rewrite the Gauss-Bonnet theorem as:\n\n∮C κ_g ds + 3∬A dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nWe are given that the area enclosed by the curve C is 4 square meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n∮C κ_g ds + 3(4) = 2πχ(S)\n\nNow, we can solve for the total geodesic curvature around the closed curve C:\n\n∮C κ_g ds = 2πχ(S) - 12\n\nTo determine the Euler characteristic χ(S), we need more information about the surface S, such as the number of vertices, edges, and faces. However, without this information, we cannot compute the Euler characteristic and, consequently, the total geodesic curvature around the closed curve C."
