    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using a recursive process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of the square root of 7.\n\nLet's denote the length of the curve after n iterations as L_n. The initial length of the line segment (n = 0) is 1 unit, so L_0 = 1.\n\nAfter the first iteration (n = 1), the length of the curve is multiplied by the square root of 7, so L_1 = L_0 * sqrt(7) = 1 * sqrt(7).\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by the square root of 7 again. Therefore, after four iterations (n = 4), the length of the curve is:\n\nL_4 = L_0 * (sqrt(7))^4 = 1 * (sqrt(7))^4 = 1 * 7^2 = 1 * 49 = 49 units.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Gosper curve after four iterations is 49 units."
