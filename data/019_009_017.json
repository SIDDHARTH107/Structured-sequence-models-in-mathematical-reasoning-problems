    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, we can't directly apply probabilities to truth values. However, we can reinterpret the problem in terms of classical logic and probabilities.\n\nGiven that A is true with probability 0.7, it means that A is false with probability 1 - 0.7 = 0.3. Similarly, if B is false with probability 0.4, then B is true with probability 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that A is true and B is false (A and not B). We can use the multiplication rule for independent events:\n\nP(A and not B) = P(A is true) * P(B is false) = 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28\n\nSo, the probability that A and not B is true is 0.28 in classical logic."
