    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate z from the first two equations. To do this, we can add the first equation to the second equation:\n\n(2x + y - z) + (4x - 3y + z) = 4 + (-8)\n6x - 2y = -4\n\nNow, we will eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we can add 2 times the first equation to the third equation:\n\n(2 * (2x + y - z)) + (3x - 2y + 2z) = 2 * 4 + 1\n7x = 9\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\nx = 9 / 7\n\nNext, we will substitute the value of x back into the equation 6x - 2y = -4:\n\n6(9/7) - 2y = -4\n54/7 - 2y = -4\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n2y = 54/7 + 4\n2y = 82/7\ny = 41/7\n\nFinally, we will substitute the values of x and y back into the first equation to solve for z:\n\n2x + y - z = 4\n2(9/7) + 41/7 - z = 4\n18/7 + 41/7 - z = 4\n59/7 - z = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = 59/7 - 4\nz = 59/7 - 28/7\nz = 31/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 9/7\ny = 41/7\nz = 31/7"
