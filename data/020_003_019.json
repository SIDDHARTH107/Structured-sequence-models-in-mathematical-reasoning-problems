    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit from selling one unit of product A is $5 and the profit from selling one unit of product B is $8. The company has 200 hours of labor available in a week for production. The production time for one unit of product A is 2 hours and for one unit of product B is 3 hours. How many units of each product should the company produce in a week to maximize the profit?",
