    "message_2": "First, let's consider the case where G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12. If G is cyclic, then it has an element of order 12, and we can construct an isomorphism between G and C12 by mapping the generator of G to the generator of C12. In this case, we are done.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is not isomorphic to C12. In this case, G must have a non-trivial normal Sylow 3-subgroup P or a non-trivial normal Sylow 2-subgroup Q (by the Sylow theorems). Without loss of generality, let's assume P is normal in G. Then, G acts on P by conjugation, which induces a homomorphism φ: G → Aut(P). Since P is a group of order 3, it is isomorphic to C3, and Aut(P) is isomorphic to C2. Thus, the image of φ is either trivial or the whole of Aut(P).\n\nIf the image of φ is trivial, then G must centralize P, which means that G is a direct product of P and a subgroup of order 4. In this case, G is isomorphic to C3 × C4, which is a group of order 12. However, this contradicts our assumption that G is not isomorphic to C12.\n\nIf the image of φ is the whole of Aut(P), then φ is an injective group homomorphism from G to A4 (since A4 is a group of order 12 containing a normal subgroup of order 3). In this case, Im(φ) is a subgroup of order 12 in A4, as required.\n\nNow, let's show that there exists an injective group homomorphism ψ: G → D6 such that Im(ψ) is a subgroup of order 12 in D6. Since G is not isomorphic to C12, it must have an element of order 6. Let a be such an element, and let b be an element of order 2 in G. Then, we can define a homomorphism ψ: G → D6 by mapping a to a rotation of order 6 and b to a reflection in D6. Since a and b generate G, ψ is injective, and Im(ψ) is a subgroup of order 12 in D6.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is not isomorphic to C12, there exists an injective group homomorphism φ: G → A4 such that Im(φ) is a subgroup of order 12 in A4, and there exists an injective group homomorphism ψ: G → D6 such that Im(ψ) is a subgroup of order 12 in D6."
