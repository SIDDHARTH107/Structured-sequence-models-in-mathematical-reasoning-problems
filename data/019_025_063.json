    "message_2": "Let's use the work formula: Work = Rate × Time\n\nIn this case, we have 5 workers completing the task in 2 hours. Let's assume each worker has a rate of R. So, the combined rate of 5 workers is 5R.\n\nWork = 5R × 2\n\nNow, we want to find out how many workers (let's call this number W) are needed to complete the same task in 1 hour.\n\nWork = W × R × 1\n\nSince the work done is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n5R × 2 = W × R × 1\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n10R = W × R\n\nNow, divide both sides by R:\n\n10 = W\n\nSo, 10 workers would be needed to complete the same task in 1 hour."
