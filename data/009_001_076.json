    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of bacteria at time t. Since the rate of growth is proportional to the size of the population, we can write the following differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫k dt\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 1000:\n\nln(1000) = k(0) + C\n\nC = ln(1000)\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = kt + ln(1000)\n\nTo find the value of k, we can use the information that P(3) = 2000:\n\nln(2000) = k(3) + ln(1000)\n\nNow, subtract ln(1000) from both sides:\n\nln(2000) - ln(1000) = 3k\n\nk = (ln(2))/3\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = (ln(2)/3)t + ln(1000)\n\nTo find the population after 5 hours, we can plug in t = 5:\n\nln(P) = (ln(2)/3)(5) + ln(1000)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to solve for P:\n\nP = e^((ln(2)/3)(5) + ln(1000))\n\nP = e^(ln(2)(5/3)) * e^(ln(1000))\n\nP = (2^(5/3)) * 1000\n\nP ≈ 1995.26\n\nSo, the population after 5 hours is approximately 1995 bacteria."
