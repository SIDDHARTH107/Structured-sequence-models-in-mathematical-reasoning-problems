    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve y = x^(3/2) on the interval [0, 4], we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = (3/2)^2 * x\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9/4)x\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of the expression:\n\n√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = √(1 + (9/4)x)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 1 + (9/4)x\ndu/dx = 9/4\ndx = (4/9)du\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 10] (4/9)√u du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2))[1, 10]\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - 1)\n\nL ≈ 15.28\n\nSo, the length of the curve y = x^(3/2) on the interval [0, 4] is approximately 15.28 units."
