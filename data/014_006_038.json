    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nSuppose you have a plaintext message that consists of 8 characters (letters, numbers or symbols) and you want to encrypt it using a one-time pad encryption. You have a random key that is also 8 characters long. The key is composed of only lower-case letters of the English alphabet (a total of 26 letters). How many possible keys exist for this encryption?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the number of possible keys for this encryption, we need to consider that there are 26 lower-case letters in the English alphabet and the key is 8 characters long. \n\nFor each position in the key, there are 26 possible letters. Since there are 8 positions, we can calculate the total number of possible keys by raising the number of possibilities (26) to the power of the number of positions (8).\n\nSo, the total number of possible keys is:\n\n26^8 = 208,827,064,576\n\nThere are 208,827,064,576 possible keys for this encryption."
