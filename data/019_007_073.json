    "message_1": "Let's assume you have a set of 100 numbers. Using non-monotonic logic, what is the minimum number of steps required to determine whether a specific number is in the set or not?",
    "message_2": "In non-monotonic logic, we cannot make definitive conclusions based on incomplete information. Therefore, to determine whether a specific number is in the set or not, we would need to examine each number in the set individually. In the worst case, the specific number could be the last one we check, or it might not be in the set at all. So, the minimum number of steps required to determine whether a specific number is in the set of 100 numbers is 100."
