    "message_1": "A company wants to design a rectangular shaped container with a fixed volume of 2000 cubic centimeters. The cost of the material to make the top and bottom of the container is $4 per square centimeter, and the cost of the material to make the four sides of the container is $2 per square centimeter. What should be the dimensions of the container to minimize the cost of the material?",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the container be length (l), width (w), and height (h). The volume of the container is given by:\n\nV = lwh = 2000 cubic centimeters\n\nThe cost of the material for the top and bottom is $4 per square centimeter, and the cost for the four sides is $2 per square centimeter. The total cost (C) can be expressed as:\n\nC = 4lw + 4lh + 4wh\n\nWe want to minimize the cost function C. To do this, we can use the constraint given by the volume equation to eliminate one of the variables. Let's solve the volume equation for h:\n\nh = 2000 / (lw)\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the cost function:\n\nC = 4lw + 4l(2000 / (lw)) + 4w(2000 / (lw))\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC = 4lw + 8000/l + 8000/w\n\nNow we can use calculus to find the minimum cost. Take the partial derivatives of C with respect to l and w, and set them equal to 0:\n\n∂C/∂l = 4w - 8000/l^2 = 0\n∂C/∂w = 4l - 8000/w^2 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n\n4w = 8000/l^2\nw = 2000/l^2\n\nFrom the second equation, we get:\n\n4l = 8000/w^2\nl = 2000/w^2\n\nNow we can set the expressions for l and w equal to each other:\n\n2000/l^2 = 2000/w^2\n\nCross-multiply:\n\nl^4 = w^4\n\nTake the fourth root of both sides:\n\nl = w\n\nSince l = w, we can substitute l for w in the expression for l:\n\nl = 2000/l^2\n\nSolve for l:\n\nl^3 = 2000\nl = (2000)^(1/3)\n\nl ≈ 12.6 centimeters\n\nSince l = w, the width is also approximately 12.6 centimeters. Now we can find the height using the volume equation:\n\nh = 2000 / (12.6 * 12.6)\nh ≈ 12.6 centimeters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the container that minimize the cost of the material are approximately 12.6 cm x 12.6 cm x 12.6 cm."
