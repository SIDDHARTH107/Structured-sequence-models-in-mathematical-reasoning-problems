    "message_1": "A ladder leaning against a wall makes an angle of 60 degrees with the ground. If the foot of the ladder is 4 meters away from the wall, how long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "We can use the trigonometric function to solve this problem. In this case, we have a right triangle with a 60-degree angle, and we know the adjacent side (the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall) is 4 meters. We want to find the length of the ladder, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n\nWe can use the cosine function to relate the angle, adjacent side, and hypotenuse:\n\ncos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\ncos(60) = 4 / hypotenuse\n\ncos(60) = 0.5 (since cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5)\n\n0.5 = 4 / hypotenuse\n\nNow, we can solve for the hypotenuse (length of the ladder):\n\nhypotenuse = 4 / 0.5\n\nhypotenuse = 8\n\nSo, the length of the ladder is 8 meters."
