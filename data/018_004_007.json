    "message_2": "Since $A^c = B^c$, this means that the complements of sets $A$ and $B$ are equal. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set.\n\nFirst, let's find the complement of set $B$. Since $B = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$ and $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, the complement of set $B$ is the set of all elements in $U$ that are not in $B$. Therefore, $B^c = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$.\n\nNow, since $A^c = B^c$, we know that $A^c = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$. To find the elements of set $A$, we need to find the complement of $A^c$. This means we need to find the set of all elements in $U$ that are not in $A^c$.\n\nSince $A^c = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ and $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, the elements of set $A$ are the elements in $U$ that are not in $A^c$. Therefore, $A = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$.\n\nSo, the elements of set $A$ are $\\boxed{\\{1, 3, 5\\}}$."
