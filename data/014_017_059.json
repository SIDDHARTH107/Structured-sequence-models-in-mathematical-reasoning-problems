    "message_2": "To determine the key used in the Caesar cipher, we need to find the most frequent letter in the ciphertext and compare it to the most frequent letter in the plaintext (usually 'E' in English). In this case, 'W' appears 25 times and is the most frequent letter in the ciphertext.\n\nLet's assume the most frequent letter in the plaintext is 'E'. Now, we need to find the key (shift value) that was used to encrypt 'E' into 'W'. \n\nThe Caesar cipher works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions. To find the key, we can calculate the difference between the positions of 'W' and 'E' in the alphabet:\n\nPosition of 'W': 23 (A=1, B=2, ..., W=23)\nPosition of 'E': 5 (A=1, B=2, ..., E=5)\n\nKey (shift value) = Position of 'W' - Position of 'E' = 23 - 5 = 18\n\nSo, the key used in the Caesar cipher is 18."
