    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is given by the equation:\n\nr = 1 - cos(θ)\n\nwhere r is the radius and θ is the angle in polar coordinates. The area of the main cardioid can be found using the polar coordinate formula for the area of a curve:\n\nA = 1/2 ∫(r^2 dθ)\n\nIn this case, r = 1 - cos(θ), so we have:\n\nA = 1/2 ∫((1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ)\n\nWe need to integrate this expression over the interval [0, 2π] to find the area of the entire cardioid:\n\nA = 1/2 ∫((1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ) from 0 to 2π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can expand the square:\n\nA = 1/2 ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + cos^2(θ) dθ)\n\nNow, we can use the double-angle identity for cosine: cos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Substituting this into the integral, we get:\n\nA = 1/2 ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + (1 + cos(2θ))/2 dθ)\n\nA = 1/2 ∫(2 - 4cos(θ) + 1 + cos(2θ) dθ)/2\n\nA = 1/2 ∫(3 - 4cos(θ) + cos(2θ) dθ)\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nA = 1/2 [3θ - 4sin(θ) + 1/2 sin(2θ)] from 0 to 2π\n\nPlugging in the limits of integration, we get:\n\nA = 1/2 [3(2π) - 4sin(2π) + 1/2 sin(4π)] - 1/2 [3(0) - 4sin(0) + 1/2 sin(0)]\n\nA = 1/2 [6π]\n\nA = 3π\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is 3π square units."
