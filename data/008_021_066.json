    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second and third equations are just multiples of the first equation. Specifically, the second equation is the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are not independent, and the system has an infinite number of solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's solve the first equation for $z$:\n\n$z = x + y - 5$\n\nNow, we have a general solution for the system:\n\n$x = x\\\\\ny = y\\\\\nz = x + y - 5$\n\nThis means that there are infinitely many solutions for this system of linear equations, and we can choose any values for $x$ and $y$ to find a corresponding value for $z$."
