    "message_2": "a) To find the period of the signal, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the individual components.\n\nThe first component has a frequency of 10 Hz, so its period is T1 = 1/10 = 0.1 seconds.\nThe second component has a frequency of 25 Hz, so its period is T2 = 1/25 = 0.04 seconds.\n\nThe LCM of 0.1 and 0.04 is 0.2 seconds. Therefore, the period of the signal x(t) is 0.2 seconds.\n\nb) The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal x(t) is given by the following formula:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt, where the integral is taken over all time.\n\nFor the given signal, x(t) = 2cos(2π(10t + 3)) + 4cos(2π(25t - 1)). We can rewrite this as:\n\nx(t) = 2cos(2π10t + 6π) + 4cos(2π25t - 2π)\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite the cosine functions as:\n\ncos(θ) = (e^(jθ) + e^(-jθ))/2\n\nSo, x(t) = (2/2)(e^(j(2π10t + 6π)) + e^(-j(2π10t + 6π))) + (4/2)(e^(j(2π25t - 2π)) + e^(-j(2π25t - 2π)))\n\nNow, we can compute the Fourier transform:\n\nX(f) = ∫[(e^(j(2π10t + 6π)) + e^(-j(2π10t + 6π)) + 2(e^(j(2π25t - 2π)) + e^(-j(2π25t - 2π)))) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nSeparating the integrals, we get:\n\nX(f) = ∫[e^(j(2π10t + 6π)) * e^(-j2πft)] dt + ∫[e^(-j(2π10t + 6π)) * e^(-j2πft)] dt + ∫[2e^(j(2π25t - 2π)) * e^(-j2πft)] dt + ∫[2e^(-j(2π25t - 2π)) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nEach of these integrals results in a Dirac delta function:\n\nX(f) = π[δ(f - 10) + δ(f + 10) + 2δ(f - 25) + 2δ(f + 25)]\n\nc) The components of the signal in the frequency domain are represented by the Dirac delta functions in the Fourier transform. There are four components:\n\n1. A component at f = 10 Hz with amplitude 1 (from δ(f - 10))\n2. A component at f = -10 Hz with amplitude 1 (from δ(f + 10))\n3. A component at f = 25 Hz with amplitude 2 (from 2δ(f - 25))\n4. A component at f = -25 Hz with amplitude 2 (from 2δ(f + 25))\n\nd) To plot the magnitude and phase spectra of the signal, we can use the components identified in part c.\n\nMagnitude spectrum:\n- At f = ±10 Hz, the magnitude is 1.\n- At f = ±25 Hz, the magnitude is 2.\n- At all other frequencies, the magnitude is 0.\n\nPhase spectrum:\n- At f = ±10 Hz, the phase is 6π (from e^(j(2π10t + 6π))).\n- At f = -10 Hz, the phase is -6π (from e^(-j(2π10t + 6π))).\n- At f = ±25 Hz, the phase is -2π (from e^(j(2π25t - 2π))).\n- At f = -25 Hz, the phase is 2π (from e^(-j(2π25t - 2π))).\n\nPlotting these values on a graph with frequency on the x-axis and magnitude/phase on the y-axis will give you the magnitude and phase spectra of the signal."
