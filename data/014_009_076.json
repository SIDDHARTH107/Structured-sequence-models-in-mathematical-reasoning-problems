    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform the actual encryption process for a Feistel cipher, as it requires a specific key and round function. However, I can provide you with a general understanding of how the encryption process works in a Feistel cipher.\n\nA Feistel cipher is a symmetric key block cipher that operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext and ciphertext. In this case, the block size is 64 bits, and there are 16 rounds of encryption. The key size is 128 bits, which means that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the Feistel cipher encryption process:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext message into 64-bit blocks. If the message is not a multiple of 64 bits, padding may be added to make it fit.\n\n2. For each 64-bit block, split it into two equal halves: a left half (L0) and a right half (R0).\n\n3. Perform 16 rounds of encryption on each block. In each round, the following steps are performed:\n\n   a. Apply a round function F to the right half (R) and the round key (a subkey derived from the main 128-bit key). The round function is a non-linear transformation that provides confusion and diffusion to the plaintext.\n   \n   b. XOR the output of the round function with the left half (L).\n   \n   c. Swap the left and right halves for the next round, except for the last round.\n\n4. After the 16 rounds, combine the final left and right halves to form the 64-bit ciphertext block.\n\n5. Concatenate all ciphertext blocks to form the final ciphertext message.\n\nTo obtain the ciphertext for the given plaintext message, you would need to know the specific 128-bit key and the round function used in the Feistel cipher. Without this information, it is not possible to provide the exact ciphertext."
