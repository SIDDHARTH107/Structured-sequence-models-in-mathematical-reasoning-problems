    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(2^2 + 5^2 + 1^2) = √(4 + 25 + 1) = √30\n|B| = √(3^2 + 6^2 + 2^2) = √(9 + 36 + 4) = √49 = 7\n\nNext, let's find the angle θ between the vectors. We can use the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nThe dot product of A and B is:\n\nA · B = (2 * 3) + (5 * 6) + (1 * 2) = 6 + 30 + 2 = 38\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = 38 / (√30 * 7) ≈ 0.8794\n\nNow, we can find θ:\n\nθ = arccos(0.8794) ≈ 28.07°\n\nNow, let's find sin(θ):\n\nsin(θ) ≈ sin(28.07°) ≈ 0.4695\n\nNow, we can find the cross product magnitude:\n\n|A x B| = |A| |B| sin(θ) ≈ √30 * 7 * 0.4695 ≈ 46.67\n\nFinally, to find the cross product vector, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A x B| n\n\nWe can find the unit vector n by using the right-hand rule or the determinant method. Using the determinant method, we have:\n\nA x B = [(5 * 2 - 1 * 6), -(2 * 2 - 1 * 3), (2 * 6 - 5 * 3)] = [4, 1, -3]\n\nNow, we can find the unit vector n:\n\nn = A x B / |A x B| = [4/46.67, 1/46.67, -3/46.67] ≈ [0.0857, 0.0214, -0.0643]\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product vector A x B:\n\nA x B = |A x B| n ≈ 46.67 * [0.0857, 0.0214, -0.0643] ≈ [4, 1, -3]\n\nSo, the cross product of A and B is [4, 1, -3]."
