Find the corresponding wavelength and express the Fourier series representation of the wave using exponential form.

    "message_2": "To find the corresponding wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, we can use the formula:\n\nwavelength (λ) = c / f\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in free space (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency of the wave (2 GHz).\n\nFirst, let's convert the frequency to Hz:\n\n2 GHz = 2 x 10^9 Hz\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength:\n\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.15 m\n\nThe wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is 0.15 meters.\n\nNow, let's express the Fourier series representation of the wave using exponential form. A plane electromagnetic wave can be represented as:\n\nE(x, t) = E0 * exp(j(kx - ωt))\n\nwhere E0 is the amplitude of the wave, j is the imaginary unit (sqrt(-1)), k is the wave number (2π/λ), ω is the angular frequency (2πf), x is the position, and t is the time.\n\nFor our wave, we have:\n\nk = 2π/λ = 2π/0.15 ≈ 41.89 rad/m\nω = 2πf = 2π(2 x 10^9) ≈ 12.57 x 10^9 rad/s\n\nSo the Fourier series representation of the wave is:\n\nE(x, t) = E0 * exp(j(41.89x - 12.57 x 10^9 t))\n\nNow, let's use the Fourier transform to determine the frequency domain representation of the wave. The Fourier transform of E(x, t) with respect to time (t) is:\n\nE(x, ω) = ∫ E(x, t) * exp(-jωt) dt\n\nSince our wave is a single frequency, the Fourier transform will result in a delta function at the frequency of the wave:\n\nE(x, ω) = E0 * δ(ω - 12.57 x 10^9) * exp(j41.89x)\n\nThis is the frequency domain representation of the electromagnetic wave."
