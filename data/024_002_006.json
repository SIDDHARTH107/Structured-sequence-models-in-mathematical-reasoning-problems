    "message_2": "To find the geodesic distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, we can use the spherical law of cosines formula:\n\nd = arccos(sin(φ1) * sin(φ2) + cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)) * R\n\nwhere d is the geodesic distance, φ1 and φ2 are the latitudes of the two points, Δλ is the difference in longitudes, and R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nHowever, we are given the chord distance (3 units) between the two points, not their latitudes and longitudes. To find the geodesic distance, we can use the following relationship between the chord distance and the geodesic distance:\n\nchord_distance = 2 * R * sin(geodesic_distance / (2 * R))\n\nWe are given the chord distance (3 units) and the radius (4 units), so we can solve for the geodesic distance:\n\n3 = 2 * 4 * sin(geodesic_distance / (2 * 4))\n3/8 = sin(geodesic_distance / 8)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\narcsin(3/8) = geodesic_distance / 8\n\nFinally, multiply both sides by 8 to get the geodesic distance:\n\ngeodesic_distance = 8 * arcsin(3/8)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\ngeodesic_distance ≈ 2.918\n\nSo, the geodesic distance between the two points on the surface of the sphere with a radius of 4 units is approximately 2.918 units."
