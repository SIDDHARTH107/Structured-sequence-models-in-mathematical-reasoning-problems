    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 9^77 is divided by 13. Since 13 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem. According to the theorem, 9^13 ≡ 9 (mod 13). \n\nNow, let's raise both sides of the congruence to the power of 5, since 77 = 13 × 5 + 2:\n\n(9^13)^5 ≡ 9^5 (mod 13)\n9^65 ≡ 9^5 (mod 13)\n\nNext, let's multiply both sides by 9^2 to get 9^77:\n\n9^65 × 9^2 ≡ 9^5 × 9^2 (mod 13)\n9^77 ≡ 9^7 (mod 13)\n\nNow we need to find the remainder when 9^7 is divided by 13. We can do this by calculating 9^7 and then finding the remainder:\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\nNow, divide 4782969 by 13:\n\n4782969 ÷ 13 = 367919 (with a remainder of 10)\n\nSo, the remainder when 9^77 is divided by 13 is 10."
