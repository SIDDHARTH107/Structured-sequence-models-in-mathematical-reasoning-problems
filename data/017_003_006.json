    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that the order of g is equal to the order of G, which is 11 in this case.\n\nSince G is a group of prime order p = 11, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element g in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 11. The identity element has order 1, so we need to find an element with order 11.\n\nLet g be an element in G with order n, where n is not equal to 1 (since the identity element already has order 1). By definition, the order of g is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e (the identity element). \n\nNow, consider the set {g, g^2, g^3, ..., g^11}. Since G has 11 elements and g is not the identity element, there must be an element in this set that is not equal to the identity element and has order 11.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that there is no such element in the set. Then, for all i in {1, 2, ..., 11}, g^i has order less than 11. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of g^i must divide the order of G, which is 11. Since 11 is prime, the only divisors of 11 are 1 and 11. We already know that the identity element has order 1, so all other elements in the set must have order 11.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our assumption that there is no element in the set with order 11. Therefore, there must exist an element g in G with order 11, and G is cyclic with generator g."
