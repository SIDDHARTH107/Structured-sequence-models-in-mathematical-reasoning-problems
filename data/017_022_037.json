    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the powers of its prime divisors (Sylow's Theorem).\n2. A group of order 60 has prime divisors 2, 3, and 5 (60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5).\n\nNow, we can use Sylow's Theorems to find the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 3 * 5, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 2^2 * 5, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 2^2 * 3, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). So, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are all cyclic, and thus the group is abelian. So, this case doesn't give us a non-abelian group.\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is the semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup with the direct product of the Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups. This gives us one non-abelian group, which is the symmetric group S_3 × Z_5.\n3. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is the semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup with the direct product of the Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups. This gives us another non-abelian group, which is the alternating group A_4 × Z_5.\n4. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 1, then the group is the semi-direct product of a Sylow 3-subgroup with the direct product of the Sylow 2 and 5-subgroups. This doesn't give us any non-abelian groups.\n5. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 6, then the group is the semi-direct product of a Sylow 5-subgroup with the direct product of the Sylow 2 and 3-subgroups. This doesn't give us any non-abelian groups.\n\nSo, there are 2 non-abelian groups of order 60:\n\n1. S_3 × Z_5\n2. A_4 × Z_5"
