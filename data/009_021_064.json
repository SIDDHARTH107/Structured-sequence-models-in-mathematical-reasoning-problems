    "message_1": "A possible question for a math student to solve using Partial Differential Equations for image processing and computer vision is:\n\nFind the solution for the heat equation in 2D with initial condition given by a Gaussian function centered at (0,0) with standard deviation 1 and boundary conditions of zero temperature on a square region of side length 10 centered at (0,0) for a time interval of 1 unit, and plot the resulting temperature distribution at t = 0.2, 0.5, and 1.\n\nNote: The heat equation in 2D is given by u_t = k (u_xx + u_yy), where u is the temperature, k is the thermal diffusivity, u_xx and u_yy are the second partial derivatives of u with respect to x and y, respectively, and t is time. The Gaussian function is given by f(x,y) = exp(-(x^2 + y^2)/2σ^2)/2πσ^2, where σ is the standard deviation.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given heat equation with the specified initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = k(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nNow, divide both sides by kX(x)Y(y)T(t) to separate the variables:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = k(X''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ / k\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ / k - Y''(y) / Y(y) = μ\nY''(y) / Y(y) = -λ / k - μ\n\nSolving these ODEs, we get:\n\nX(x) = A cos(√μx) + B sin(√μx)\nY(y) = C cos(√(λ/k - μ)y) + D sin(√(λ/k - μ)y)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for the square region, we have:\n\nX(-5) = X(5) = 0\nY(-5) = Y(5) = 0\n\nThis implies that:\n\nB sin(√μ(-5)) = 0\nD sin(√(λ/k - μ)(-5)) = 0\n\nFor non-trivial solutions, we require:\n\n√μ = nπ / 10, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n√(λ/k - μ) = mπ / 10, m = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑(A_n,m cos(nπx/10) sin(mπy/10) e^(-k(n^2 + m^2)π^2t/100))\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n,m, we use the initial condition:\n\nf(x, y) = exp(-(x^2 + y^2)/2)/2π\n\nWe can find A_n,m by taking the inner product of f(x, y) with the eigenfunctions:\n\nA_n,m = ∫∫f(x, y) cos(nπx/10) sin(mπy/10) dx dy\n\nNow, we have the solution u(x, y, t) with the coefficients A_n,m. To plot the temperature distribution at t = 0.2, 0.5, and 1, we can substitute these values of t into the solution and use a suitable numerical method or software to compute the resulting temperature distribution."
