    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point $(1, -1, -1)$, we need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$. \n\nLet $F(x, y, z) = y^2z^3 + 3x^2z^3 - x^3$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 6xz^3 - 3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2yz^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 3y^2z^2 + 9x^2z^2$\n\nNow, we evaluate the partial derivatives at the point $(1, -1, -1)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(1, -1, -1) = 6(1)(-1)^3 - 3(1)^2 = -3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(1, -1, -1) = 2(-1)(-1)^3 = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}(1, -1, -1) = 3(-1)^2(-1)^2 + 9(1)^2(-1)^2 = -12$\n\nThe gradient of the surface at the point $(1, -1, -1)$ is given by the vector $(-3, 2, -12)$. The equation of the tangent plane can be written as:\n\n$-3(x - 1) + 2(y + 1) - 12(z + 1) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$-3x + 3 + 2y + 2 - 12z - 12 = 0$\n\n$-3x + 2y - 12z - 7 = 0$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point $(1, -1, -1)$ is:\n\n$-3x + 2y - 12z = 7$."
