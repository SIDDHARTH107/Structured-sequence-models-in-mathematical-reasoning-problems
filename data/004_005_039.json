    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 500 liters of water and is being filled with water at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The water is then drained from the tank at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Write a differential equation that models the amount of water in the tank at any given moment. Use this differential equation to find the time at which the tank will be half full.",
    "message_2": "Let W(t) represent the amount of water in the tank at time t (in minutes). The tank is being filled at a rate of 4 liters per minute and drained at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Therefore, the net rate of change of the amount of water in the tank is 4 - 2 = 2 liters per minute.\n\nWe can write a differential equation to represent this situation:\n\ndW/dt = 2\n\nTo find the amount of water in the tank at any given time, we need to solve this differential equation. We can do this by integrating both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(dW/dt) dt = ∫2 dt\nW(t) = 2t + C\n\nNow we need to find the value of the constant C. We know that the tank initially contains 500 liters of water, so when t = 0, W(t) = 500:\n\n500 = 2(0) + C\nC = 500\n\nSo our equation for the amount of water in the tank at any given time is:\n\nW(t) = 2t + 500\n\nTo find the time at which the tank will be half full, we need to find the value of t when W(t) = 250:\n\n250 = 2t + 500\n\nSubtract 500 from both sides:\n\n-250 = 2t\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nt = -125\n\nHowever, a negative time doesn't make sense in this context. This result indicates that the tank will never be half full, as the net rate of change is positive (2 liters per minute), and the tank is continuously being filled."
