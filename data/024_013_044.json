    "message_2": "To compute the volume form of the given metric, we first need to find the determinant of the metric tensor g_ij. In this case, the metric tensor is a 2x2 matrix:\n\ng_ij = | 4    0  |\n       | 0  4sin^2(θ) |\n\nThe determinant of g_ij is:\n\ndet(g_ij) = 4 * 4sin^2(θ) = 16sin^2(θ)\n\nNow, we can compute the volume form, which is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by the differential volume element:\n\n√(det(g_ij)) dθ dφ = √(16sin^2(θ)) dθ dφ = 4|sin(θ)| dθ dφ\n\nSince θ ranges from 0 to π, sin(θ) is non-negative, so we can drop the absolute value:\n\nvolume form = 4sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nNow, we can compute the volume of the sphere of radius 2 using this volume form. The volume is given by the integral of the volume form over the entire sphere:\n\nV = ∫∫ 4sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nThe limits of integration for θ are from 0 to π, and for φ are from 0 to 2π. Therefore, we have:\n\nV = ∫(0 to 2π) dφ ∫(0 to π) 4sin(θ) dθ\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to θ:\n\n∫(0 to π) 4sin(θ) dθ = [-4cos(θ)](0 to π) = 8\n\nNow, we integrate with respect to φ:\n\nV = ∫(0 to 2π) 8 dφ = [8φ](0 to 2π) = 16π\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere with the given metric is 16π."
