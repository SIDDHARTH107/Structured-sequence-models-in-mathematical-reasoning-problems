    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a complex fractal, and its exact area is difficult to compute analytically. However, it is known that the Mandelbrot set is bounded by a circle with a radius of 2 centered at the origin of the complex plane. This is because any complex number with a magnitude greater than 2 will escape to infinity under the iterative process that defines the Mandelbrot set.\n\nThe area of the Mandelbrot set has been estimated through numerical methods, such as pixel counting and Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates of the area of the Mandelbrot set are approximately 1.50659177 square units. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the true area of the Mandelbrot set is still an open question in mathematics."
