    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line at x=3, we first need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x.\n\nThe given equation is y = x^2 - 2x + 1.\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we have:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2)/dx - d(2x)/dx + d(1)/dx\n\ndy/dx = 2x - 2 + 0\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at x=3. Substitute x=3 into the derivative equation:\n\ndy/dx = 2(3) - 2\n\ndy/dx = 6 - 2\n\ndy/dx = 4\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at x=3 is 4."
