Find the minimum amount of cable needed to connect all the cities.\n\n| Cities | A | B | C | D |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|\n| A      | 0 | 2 | 3 | 5 |\n| B      | 2 | 0 | 4 | 6 |\n| C      | 3 | 4 | 0 | 7 |\n| D      | 5 | 6 | 7 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the minimum length of cable needed to connect all the cities in this network?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum length of cable needed to connect all the cities in this network, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. In this case, we will use Kruskal's algorithm.\n\n1. Sort all the edges (distances between cities) in non-decreasing order of their weight (distance).\n   We have the following sorted edges: (A, B) = 2, (A, C) = 3, (B, C) = 4, (A, D) = 5, (B, D) = 6, (C, D) = 7.\n\n2. Start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree (MST) in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge doesn't form a cycle in the MST.\n\n3. Add edge (A, B) = 2 to the MST.\n\n4. Add edge (A, C) = 3 to the MST.\n\n5. Edge (B, C) = 4 would form a cycle with the edges already in the MST, so we skip it.\n\n6. Add edge (A, D) = 5 to the MST. Now all the cities are connected.\n\nThe minimum length of cable needed to connect all the cities in this network is the sum of the edge weights in the MST: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10."
