    "message_1": "Consider an abelian variety $A$ with dimension $2$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ defined by the equation $y^2=x^3+ax+b$, where $a,b\\in\\mathbb{C}$. If the discriminant $\\Delta=-16(4a^3+27b^2)$ is equal to $-529$, find the value of $a$.",
    "message_2": "Given the discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) = -529$, we want to find the value of $a$. First, let's simplify the equation:\n\n$-16(4a^3 + 27b^2) = -529$\n\nDivide both sides by $-16$:\n\n$4a^3 + 27b^2 = 529/16$\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $a$. Since $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers, we cannot directly solve for $a$ without more information about $b$. However, we can express $a$ in terms of $b$:\n\n$4a^3 = 529/16 - 27b^2$\n\n$a^3 = (529 - 432b^2)/64$\n\n$a = \\sqrt[3]{(529 - 432b^2)/64}$\n\nSo, the value of $a$ depends on the value of $b$. Without more information about the relationship between $a$ and $b$, we cannot find a specific value for $a$."
