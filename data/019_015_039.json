    "message_2": "To find the Church numeral representation of `3`, we need to apply the successor function `S` three times to `0`. \n\nFirst, let's apply `S` to `0`:\n\n`S(0) = λf.λx.f(0 f x) = λf.λx.f(x)` (since `0 f x = x`)\n\nNow, let's apply `S` to `S(0)`:\n\n`S(S(0)) = λf.λx.f(S(0) f x) = λf.λx.f((λf.λx.f(x)) f x) = λf.λx.f(f(x))`\n\nFinally, let's apply `S` to `S(S(0))`:\n\n`S(S(S(0))) = λf.λx.f(S(S(0)) f x) = λf.λx.f((λf.λx.f(f(x))) f x) = λf.λx.f(f(f(x)))`\n\nSo, the Church numeral representation of `3` in type theory is `λf.λx.f(f(f(x)))`."
