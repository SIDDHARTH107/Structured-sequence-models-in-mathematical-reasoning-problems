    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 4cm and a slant height of 10cm. What is the surface area of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (curved part) and then add them together.\n\n1. Base area (A_base): A_base = π * r^2, where r is the radius of the base.\nA_base = π * (4 cm)^2 = 16π cm^2\n\n2. Lateral surface area (A_lateral): A_lateral = π * r * l, where l is the slant height of the cone.\nA_lateral = π * (4 cm) * (10 cm) = 40π cm^2\n\n3. Total surface area (A_total): A_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 16π cm^2 + 40π cm^2 = 56π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 56π cm^2."
