    "message_1": "A metal tube is in the shape of a torus whose minor radius is 3 cm and major radius is 7 cm. If the length of the tube is 20 cm, what is the volume of the metal used in making the tube?",
    "message_2": "The problem seems to have a contradiction. A torus is a 3-dimensional shape formed by revolving a circle in 3D space around an axis coplanar with the circle. The minor radius (r) is the radius of the circle being revolved, and the major radius (R) is the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution.\n\nHowever, the problem also mentions a \"length of the tube\" which is not a parameter used to describe a torus. It seems like the problem might be mixing up a torus with a cylindrical tube. \n\nPlease clarify the problem, and I'd be happy to help you solve it."
