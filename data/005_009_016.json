    "message_2": "To find the median of the given data set using the non-parametric method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order: 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21\n2. Determine the middle value: Since there are 9 data points, the middle value is the 5th value in the ordered list.\n\nThe median of the data set is 12."
