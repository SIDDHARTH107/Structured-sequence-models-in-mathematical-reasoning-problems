    "message_2": "To find the first value of x that exhibits a period-3 cycle in the logistic map, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation x_n+1 = r*x_n(1-x_n) with r = 2.8 and has a period of 3.\n\nLet's denote the three values in the period-3 cycle as x1, x2, and x3. We have the following equations:\n\nx2 = 2.8 * x1 * (1 - x1)\nx3 = 2.8 * x2 * (1 - x2)\nx1 = 2.8 * x3 * (1 - x3)\n\nWe can solve these equations numerically to find the first value of x that exhibits a period-3 cycle. Using a numerical method like the Newton-Raphson method or a computer program, we can find that the first value of x that exhibits a period-3 cycle is approximately x1 â‰ˆ 0.543689."
