    "message_1": "Consider the implicit function given by the equation: 4x^2 + 3xy + 2y^2 = 10. \nFind the derivative of y with respect to x using the chain rule, if x = 1.",
    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as an implicit function of x. Then, we will solve for dy/dx.\n\nGiven equation: 4x^2 + 3xy + 2y^2 = 10\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx (4x^2) + d/dx (3xy) + d/dx (2y^2) = d/dx (10)\n\nUsing the chain rule and product rule:\n\n8x + 3(dy/dx * x + y) + 4y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we will solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx * (3x + 4y) = -8x - 3y\n\ndy/dx = (-8x - 3y) / (3x + 4y)\n\nNow, we will find the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 1. To do this, we first need to find the corresponding value of y when x = 1. We can plug x = 1 into the original equation:\n\n4(1)^2 + 3(1)y + 2y^2 = 10\n\n4 + 3y + 2y^2 = 10\n\n2y^2 + 3y - 6 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\ny = (-3 ± √(3^2 - 4(2)(-6))) / (2(2))\n\ny = (-3 ± √(57)) / 4\n\nThere are two possible values for y: y1 = (-3 + √57) / 4 and y2 = (-3 - √57) / 4.\n\nNow, we will find the derivative of y with respect to x for both values of y:\n\nFor y1:\n\ndy/dx = (-8(1) - 3((-3 + √57) / 4)) / (3(1) + 4((-3 + √57) / 4))\n\nFor y2:\n\ndy/dx = (-8(1) - 3((-3 - √57) / 4)) / (3(1) + 4((-3 - √57) / 4))\n\nThese are the derivatives of y with respect to x for the two possible values of y when x = 1."
