    "message_2": "A cyclic group G of order 12 is generated by an element a, such that a^12 = e (identity element). The subgroups of G are determined by the divisors of 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We will find a generator for each subgroup corresponding to these divisors.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: {e}\n   Generator: None, since this is the trivial group containing only the identity element.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2: {e, a^6}\n   Generator: a^6, since (a^6)^2 = a^12 = e.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 3: {e, a^4, a^8}\n   Generator: a^4, since (a^4)^3 = a^12 = e and (a^4)^2 = a^8 ≠ e.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 4: {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}\n   Generator: a^3, since (a^3)^4 = a^12 = e, (a^3)^2 = a^6 ≠ e, and (a^3)^3 = a^9 ≠ e.\n\n5. Subgroup of order 6: {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}\n   Generator: a^2, since (a^2)^6 = a^12 = e, (a^2)^2 = a^4 ≠ e, (a^2)^3 = a^6 ≠ e, and (a^2)^4 = a^8 ≠ e.\n\n6.
