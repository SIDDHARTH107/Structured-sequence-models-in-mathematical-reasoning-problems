    "message_2": "To find the measure of the angle opposite to the side with length 8 cm, we will use the Law of Cosines. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have a = 5 cm, b = 8 cm, and c = 9 cm. We want to find the angle B.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that:\n\nb² = a² + c² - 2ac * cos(B)\n\nWe can plug in the values of a, b, and c:\n\n8² = 5² + 9² - 2 * 5 * 9 * cos(B)\n\n64 = 25 + 81 - 90 * cos(B)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(B):\n\ncos(B) = (a² + c² - b²) / (2ac)\n\ncos(B) = (5² + 9² - 8²) / (2 * 5 * 9)\n\ncos(B) = (25 + 81 - 64) / 90\n\ncos(B) = 42 / 90\n\ncos(B) = 7 / 15\n\nNow, we can find the angle B by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value we found:\n\nB = arccos(7 / 15)\n\nB ≈ 62.2°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite to the side with length 8 cm is approximately 62.2°."
