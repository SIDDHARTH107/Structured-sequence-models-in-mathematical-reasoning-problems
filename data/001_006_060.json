    "message_2": "a) To graph the equation, we first need to find the vertex, axis of symmetry, and x- and y-intercepts.\n\nb) The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c can be found using the formula:\n\nVertex: (h, k) = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = -4, and c = 1. So, we have:\n\nh = -(-4) / (2 * 2) = 4 / 4 = 1\nk = f(1) = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) + 1 = 2 - 4 + 1 = -1\n\nSo, the vertex is (1, -1).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is x = h, which in this case is x = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the x- and y-intercepts.\n\nFor the x-intercepts, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(2)(1))) / (2 * 2)\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 8)) / 4\nx = (4 ± √8) / 4\n\nSince √8 is a positive number, we have two x-intercepts: x = (4 + √8) / 4 and x = (4 - √8) / 4.\n\nFor the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 - 4(0) + 1\ny = 1\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 1).\n\nNow, we can graph the equation with the vertex at (1, -1), the axis of symmetry at x = 1, and the x-intercepts at x = (4 + √8) / 4 and x = (4 - √8) / 4, and the y-intercept at (0, 1).\n\nc) The roots of the equation are the x-intercepts, which we already found:\n\nx = (4 + √8) / 4 and x = (4 - √8) / 4\n\nThese are the two real roots of the equation."
