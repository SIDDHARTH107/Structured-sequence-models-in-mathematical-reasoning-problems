    "message_1": "Sorry, but intuitionistic logic does not involve numerical problems. It deals with propositions using symbols and logical connectives. Therefore, I cannot create a precise numerical problem for you to solve. However, I can provide a sample question related to intuitionistic logic that requires evaluating propositional statements.\n\nConsider the proposition 'P ∧ Q' where P and Q are propositional statements. Show that 'P ∧ Q' is equivalent to 'Q ∧ P'.",
    "message_2": "To show that 'P ∧ Q' is equivalent to 'Q ∧ P', we can use the definition of conjunction and the properties of intuitionistic logic.\n\nThe conjunction 'P ∧ Q' is true if and only if both P and Q are true. Similarly, 'Q ∧ P' is true if and only if both Q and P are true. \n\nLet's consider the following cases:\n\n1. If both P and Q are true, then 'P ∧ Q' is true, and 'Q ∧ P' is also true.\n2. If P is true and Q is false, then 'P ∧ Q' is false, and 'Q ∧ P' is also false.\n3. If P is false and Q is true, then 'P ∧ Q' is false, and 'Q ∧ P' is also false.\n4. If both P and Q are false, then 'P ∧ Q' is false, and 'Q ∧ P' is also false.\n\nIn all cases, the truth values of 'P ∧ Q' and 'Q ∧ P' are the same. Therefore, 'P ∧ Q' is equivalent to 'Q ∧ P'."
