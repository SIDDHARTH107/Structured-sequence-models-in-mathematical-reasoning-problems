    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = (x-1)/(x+1) on the interval -π < x < π, we first need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nThe Fourier series of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nLet's compute a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] ((x-1)/(x+1)) * cos(nx) dx\n\nSince the function f(x) is odd and cos(nx) is even, their product is odd. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow let's compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] ((x-1)/(x+1)) * sin(nx) dx\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] ((x-1)/(x+1)) * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] ((x-1)/(x+1)) * sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve these integrals. Let u = (x-1)/(x+1) and dv = sin(nx) dx. Then, du = (2 dx)/(x+1)^2 and v = -(1/n) * cos(nx).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[-π, 0] ((x-1)/(x+1)) * sin(nx) dx = -[(x-1)/(x+1) * (1/n) * cos(nx)] | -π to 0 + (1/n) * ∫[-π, 0] (2 cos(nx))/(x+1)^2 dx\n\n∫[0, π] ((x-1)/(x+1)) * sin(nx) dx = -[(x-1)/(x+1) * (1/n) * cos(nx)] | 0 to π + (1/n) * ∫[0, π] (2 cos(nx))/(x+1)^2 dx\n\nNow, we can compute the remaining integrals numerically or using a symbolic computation tool.\n\nThe Fourier series of f(x) = (x-1)/(x+1) on the interval -π < x < π is given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ(b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere b_n is computed as described above.\n\nRegarding the convergence of the Fourier series, since f(x) is continuous and piecewise smooth on the interval -π < x < π, its Fourier series converges to f(x) at all points x in the interval."
