    "message_2": "The bat algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. However, for the given function f(x) = 5x^2 - 2x + 10, we can find the minimum value using calculus instead of the bat algorithm, as it is a simple quadratic function.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function, we first find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = d(5x^2 - 2x + 10) / dx = 10x - 2\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n10x - 2 = 0\n10x = 2\nx = 1/5\n\nSince the second derivative f''(x) = 10 (which is positive), we know that x = 1/5 corresponds to a minimum point. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function:\n\nf(1/5) = 5(1/5)^2 - 2(1/5) + 10 = 5/5 - 2/5 + 10 = 1 - 0.4 + 10 = 10.6\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) is 10.6, which is less than or equal to 20, satisfying the constraint. The value of x that minimizes the function is 1/5 or 0.2, which is within the given range of 0 <= x <= 10. Since we have found the exact minimum value using calculus, there is no need to use the bat algorithm in this case."
