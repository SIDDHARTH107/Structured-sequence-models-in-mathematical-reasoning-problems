So, A ∩ B = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, let's show that A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of A. Since A ∩ B = {3, 5, 7}, we can see that all these elements are also in set A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow, let's show that A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of B.
