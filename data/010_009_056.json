    "message_2": "To divide the rectangle into 30 triangles of equal areas, we can first divide the rectangle into 15 equal smaller rectangles and then divide each of these smaller rectangles into 2 triangles.\n\nThe area of the given rectangle is:\nArea = length × height = 10 cm × 8 cm = 80 cm²\n\nSince we want to divide the rectangle into 15 equal smaller rectangles, the area of each smaller rectangle will be:\nArea of each smaller rectangle = (Total Area) / 15 = 80 cm² / 15 = 16/3 cm²\n\nNow, let's divide the rectangle into 5 columns and 3 rows of smaller rectangles. The dimensions of each smaller rectangle will be:\nLength of each smaller rectangle = (Total Length) / 5 = 10 cm / 5 = 2 cm\nHeight of each smaller rectangle = (Total Height) / 3 = 8 cm / 3 ≈ 2.67 cm\n\nNow, we can divide each smaller rectangle into 2 triangles by drawing a diagonal. Since the smaller rectangles are equal in size, the triangles will also have equal areas.\n\nThe area of each triangle will be half the area of each smaller rectangle:\nArea of each triangle = (Area of each smaller rectangle) / 2 = (16/3 cm²) / 2 = 8/3 cm²\n\nNow, let's calculate the perimeter of each triangle. We know the base and height of each triangle:\nBase = 2 cm\nHeight ≈ 2.67 cm\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal (hypotenuse) of each triangle:\nDiagonal² = Base² + Height²\nDiagonal² = (2 cm)² + (2.67 cm)² ≈ 4 cm² + 7.1289 cm² ≈ 11.1289 cm²\nDiagonal ≈ √11.1289 cm ≈ 3.34 cm\n\nFinally, the perimeter of each triangle will be the sum of its three sides:\nPerimeter ≈ Base + Height + Diagonal ≈ 2 cm + 2.67 cm + 3.34 cm ≈ 8.01 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of each triangle is approximately 8.01 cm."
