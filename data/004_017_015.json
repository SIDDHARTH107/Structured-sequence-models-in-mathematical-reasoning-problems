    "message_1": "A curve is defined by the equation y = 4x^(3/2) between x = 0 and x = 4. Find the arc length of the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = 4x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2) * 4x^(1/2) = 6x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can find the square of the derivative:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = (6x^(1/2))^2 = 36x\n\nNext, we add 1 to the square of the derivative:\n\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + 36x\n\nNow, we can find the square root of the expression:\n\n√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = √(1 + 36x)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the arc length:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + 36x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 1 + 36x\ndu/dx = 36\ndx = du/36\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 145] √(u) (du/36)\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (1/36) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2))[1, 145]\nL = (1/54) * (145^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nNow, we can calculate the arc length:\n\nL = (1/54) * (145^(3/2) - 1)\nL ≈ 61.94\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve is approximately 61.94 units."
