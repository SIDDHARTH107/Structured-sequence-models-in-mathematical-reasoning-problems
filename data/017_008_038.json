    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, there must be a subgroup of order 4, which we will call H. We will now analyze the possible structures of G and its subgroups.\n\n1. G is a cyclic group of order 8 (C8): In this case, G has subgroups of order 1, 2, and 4, namely C1, C2, and C4. There are no other subgroups in this case.\n\n2. G is a dihedral group of order 8 (D4): In this case, G has subgroups of order 1, 2, and 4. The subgroups of order 1 and 2 are C1 and C2, respectively. There are two distinct subgroups of order 4, both of which are isomorphic to C4. There are no other subgroups in this case.\n\n3. G is a quaternion group (Q8): In this case, G has subgroups of order 1, 2, and 4. The subgroup of order 1 is C1. There are three distinct subgroups of order 2, all of which are isomorphic to C2. There is one subgroup of order 4, which is isomorphic to Q8 itself. There are no other subgroups in this case.\n\nIn all three cases, the distinct subgroups of G can be isomorphic to C1, C2, C4, Q8, or D2 (note that D2 is isomorphic to C2). The total number of distinct subgroups depends on the structure of G:\n\n- If G is C8, there are 4 distinct subgroups (C1, C2, C4, and G itself).\n- If G is D4, there are 6 distinct subgroups (C1, three copies of C2, two copies of C4, and G itself).\n- If G is Q8, there are 6 distinct subgroups (C1, three copies of C2, Q8, and G itself).\n\nSo, the number of distinct subgroups of a group of order 8 can be 4, 6, or 6, depending on the structure of the group. In each case, the subgroups can be isomorphic to C1, C2, C4, Q8, or D2."
