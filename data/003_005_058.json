    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the distance from the person to the tower (adjacent side) is 35 meters, and the height of the tower (opposite side) is what we want to find.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 35\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3:\n\n√3 = height / 35\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the tower:\n\nheight = 35 * √3\n\nheight ≈ 35 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 60.62 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tower is approximately 60.62 meters."
