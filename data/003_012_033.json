    "message_2": "To find the distance between the person and the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation, the opposite side (height of the building), and the adjacent side (distance between the person and the building) in a right triangle.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the person and the building as x. We are given the angle of elevation (60 degrees) and the height of the building (50 feet). We can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(60) = 50 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 50 / tan(60)\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3:\n\nx = 50 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the square root of 3:\n\nx = (50 * √3) / (√3 * √3)\nx = (50 * √3) / 3\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of x:\n\nx ≈ (50 * 1.732) / 3\nx ≈ 86.6 / 3\nx ≈ 28.87\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the distance between the person and the building is approximately 28.9 feet."
