    "message_1": "Suppose there are five bidders in an auction for an antique watch. Each bidder values the watch at a different price: $200, $300, $400, $500, and $600 respectively. The auction is a second-price sealed-bid auction, which means that the highest bidder wins the auction and pays the second-highest bid price. \n\nWhat is the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder, and what is the expected winning bid price?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation of the item. This is because bidding their true valuation ensures that they will never overpay for the item, and they will only win the auction if the item is worth more to them than to any other bidder.\n\nSo, the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder is as follows:\n- Bidder 1: $200\n- Bidder 2: $300\n- Bidder 3: $400\n- Bidder 4: $500\n- Bidder 5: $600\n\nThe expected winning bid price will be the second-highest bid, which in this case is $500. This is because Bidder 5, who values the watch at $600, will win the auction, but they will only have to pay the second-highest bid price, which is Bidder 4's bid of $500."
