    "message_1": "Suppose a group of fishermen share a pond stocked with 500 fish. Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 10 fish per day. The cost of catching a fish is $5, and every fish caught can be sold for $20. If the fishermen cooperate and only catch a total of 100 fish per day, they can sustainably fish in the pond for an extended period of time. However, if the fishermen act selfishly and each catches as many fish as possible, the pond will be depleted within 50 days, at which point they will no longer be able to catch any fish. \n\nIf there are 5 fishermen competing for fish in the pond, how many fish will each fisherman catch each day if they act selfishly, and what will the total earnings of all fishermen be until the pond is depleted?",
    "message_2": "If the fishermen act selfishly, each of them will catch the maximum of 10 fish per day. Since there are 5 fishermen, they will catch a total of 5 * 10 = 50 fish per day. \n\nThe pond will be depleted within 50 days, so they will be able to fish for 500 / 50 = 10 days.\n\nDuring these 10 days, each fisherman will catch 10 fish per day, so they will catch a total of 10 * 10 = 100 fish each.\n\nThe cost of catching a fish is $5, so the cost of catching 100 fish is 100 * 5 = $500.\n\nEach fish caught can be sold for $20, so the revenue from selling 100 fish is 100 * 20 = $2000.\n\nThe total earnings for each fisherman will be the revenue minus the cost, which is $2000 - $500 = $1500.\n\nSince there are 5 fishermen, the total earnings of all fishermen will be 5 * $1500 = $7500."
