    "message_1": "A circus performer is attempting to juggle four balls simultaneously. The probability of successfully completing the act without dropping any balls is 0.2. What is the probability that the performer will drop at least one ball during the juggling act?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the performer dropping at least one ball, we can use the complement rule. The complement of the event \"successfully completing the act without dropping any balls\" is \"dropping at least one ball.\" \n\nThe complement rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the probability of successfully completing the act without dropping any balls is 0.2. Therefore, the probability of dropping at least one ball is:\n\nP(dropping at least one ball) = 1 - P(successfully completing the act without dropping any balls)\nP(dropping at least one ball) = 1 - 0.2\nP(dropping at least one ball) = 0.8\n\nSo, the probability that the performer will drop at least one ball during the juggling act is 0.8 or 80%."
