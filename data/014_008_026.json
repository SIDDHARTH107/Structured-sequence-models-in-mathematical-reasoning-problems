    "message_2": "For an 8-round block cipher with a key length of 128 bits, the number of possible keys is determined by the key length. Since there are 128 bits, and each bit can be either a 0 or a 1, there are 2^128 possible keys. \n\n2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456\n\nSo, there are 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible keys for this 8-round block cipher."
