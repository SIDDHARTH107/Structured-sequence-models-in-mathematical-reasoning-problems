    "message_1": "A trapezium has parallel sides of length 6 cm and 10 cm respectively. Its height is 8 cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides (the non-parallel sides). We can do this by creating two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side.\n\nLet's call the vertices of the trapezium A, B, C, and D, with AB being the shorter parallel side (6 cm) and CD being the longer parallel side (10 cm). Draw a perpendicular line from A to CD, and let's call the intersection point E. Now, we have two right triangles: ABE and AED.\n\nIn triangle ABE, we have the height (8 cm) and the length of the base (BE). To find the length of BE, we can observe that the trapezium is symmetrical, so BE is half the difference between the lengths of the parallel sides:\n\nBE = (10 - 6) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 cm\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the non-parallel side AD:\n\nAD² = AE² + DE²\nAD² = 8² + 2²\nAD² = 64 + 4\nAD² = 68\nAD = √68 ≈ 8.246 cm\n\nSince the trapezium is symmetrical, the length of the other non-parallel side BC is also 8.246 cm.\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = AB + BC + CD + DA\nPerimeter = 6 + 8.246 + 10 + 8.246\nPerimeter ≈ 32.492 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 32.492 cm."
