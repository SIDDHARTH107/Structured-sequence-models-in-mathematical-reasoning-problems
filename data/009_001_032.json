    "message_1": "A small island has a population of 5,000 people. Based on past trends, the annual growth rate of this population is 2%. Write a differential equation to model the population growth and solve it to find the population size after 10 years.",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth, we can use the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population size, t is time (in years), and k is the growth rate.\n\nGiven the annual growth rate of 2%, we can write k as 0.02.\n\nSo, the differential equation becomes:\n\ndP/dt = 0.02P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.02 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.02 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.02t + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition that the population is 5,000 when t = 0:\n\nln(5000) = 0.02(0) + C\n\nC = ln(5000)\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = 0.02t + ln(5000)\n\nTo find the population size after 10 years, we can plug in t = 10:\n\nln(P) = 0.02(10) + ln(5000)\n\nln(P) = 0.2 + ln(5000)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to solve for P:\n\nP = e^(0.2 + ln(5000))\n\nP ≈ e^(0.2) * 5000\n\nP ≈ 1.2214 * 5000\n\nP ≈ 6107\n\nAfter 10 years, the population size will be approximately 6,107 people."
