Define the Reeb vector field $R$  associated to $\\alpha$   by $\\alpha(R) = 1$ and $d\\alpha(R, \\cdot) = 0$. Verify that $R = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ and compute the integral curve of $R$ passing through the point $(0,0,0)$ that lies on the hyperbolic surface defined by $x^2 + y^2 -z^2 = 1$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the differential of the contact form $\\alpha$. We have:\n\n$$d\\alpha = d(dz + xdy) = d(xdy) = dx \\wedge dy.$$\n\nNow, let's find the Reeb vector field $R$. We need to satisfy the conditions $\\alpha(R) = 1$ and $d\\alpha(R, \\cdot) = 0$. Let $R = a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + c\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, then we have:\n\n$$\\alpha(R) = (dz + xdy)(a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + c\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}) = c = 1.$$\n\nSo, $c = 1$ and $R = a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$. Now, we need to satisfy the second condition $d\\alpha(R, \\cdot) = 0$. For any vector field $V = p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + q\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, we have:\n\n$$d\\alpha(R, V) = (dx \\wedge dy)(R, V) = (a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}, p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + q\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}) = aq - bp.$$\n\nWe want this to be zero for all $p, q$. This implies that $a = b = 0$. Therefore, the Reeb vector field is:\n\n$$R = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}.$$\n\nNow, let's compute the integral curve of $R$ passing through the point $(0,0,0)$ that lies on the hyperbolic surface defined by $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1$. The integral curve is given by the system of ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0, \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0, \\frac{dz}{dt} = 1.$$\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\n$$x(t) = x_0, y(t) = y_0, z(t) = z_0 + t,$$\n\nwhere $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is the initial point of the integral curve. Since the integral curve passes through $(0,0,0)$, we have $x_0 = y_0 = 0$ and $z_0 = 0$. Thus, the integral curve is:\n\n$$x(t) = 0, y(t) = 0, z(t) = t.$$\n\nHowever, this integral curve does not lie on the hyperbolic surface $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1$, as for this curve we have $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = -t^2 \\neq 1$. Therefore, there is no integral curve of the Reeb vector field $R$ passing through the point $(0,0,0)$ that lies on the given hyperbolic surface."
