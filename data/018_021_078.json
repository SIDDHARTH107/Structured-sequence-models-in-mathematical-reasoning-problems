    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as AΔB. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nAΔB = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {5} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, we subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nAΔB = {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection of the set AΔB with the set {5, 8, 9}:\n\n(AΔB) ∩ {5, 8, 9} = {8, 9}\n\nSo, the final answer is {8, 9}."
