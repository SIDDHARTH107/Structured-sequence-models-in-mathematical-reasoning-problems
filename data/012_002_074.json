    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of a graph, we need to find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree (Δ) of the graph. Since there are 10 edges and 7 vertices, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 10) / 7 ≈ 2.86. Therefore, the maximum degree of the graph must be at least 3.\n\nNow, let's use the upper bound theorem for the chromatic number, which states that the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ + 1. In this case, χ(G) ≤ Δ + 1.\n\nSince the maximum degree Δ is at least 3, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most 4. However, we cannot guarantee that the chromatic number is 3 without more information about the specific structure of the graph.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of the graph is at most 4."
