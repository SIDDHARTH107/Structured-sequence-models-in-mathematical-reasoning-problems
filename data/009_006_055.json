    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reactant. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nrate = -d[A]/dt = k[A]\n\nwhere [A] is the concentration of the reactant, t is the time, and k is the rate constant.\n\nTo solve for the concentration of the reactant after a certain time, we can integrate this equation:\n\n∫(d[A]/[A]) = ∫(k dt)\n\nUpon integrating, we get:\n\nln([A]) = -kt + C\n\nwhere C is the integration constant. To find C, we can use the initial condition that at t=0, [A] = [A]₀ (initial concentration):\n\nln([A]₀) = -k(0) + C\nC = ln([A]₀)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln([A]) = -kt + ln([A]₀)\n\nTo find the concentration of the reactant after 30 minutes, we can plug in the given values for k, [A]₀, and t:\n\nln([A]) = -0.02 min⁻¹ * 30 min + ln(2 mol/L)\n\nln([A]) = -0.6 + ln(2)\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to get the concentration [A]:\n\n[A] = e^(-0.6 + ln(2))\n\n[A] ≈ 0.819 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of the reactant after 30 minutes of reaction is approximately 0.819 mol/L."
