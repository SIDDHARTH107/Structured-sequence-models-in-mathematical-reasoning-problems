    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2  1  1 |\n    | 3 -1  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 5 |\n    | 1 |\n    | 3 |\n\nNow, we will find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv) and multiply it with matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nTo find the inverse of matrix A, we first need to find its determinant.\n\ndet(A) = 1(1*2 - 1*(-1)) - 2(2*2 - 1*1) - (-1)(3*1 - 2*(-1))\n       = 1(2 + 1) - 2(4 - 1) + 1(3 + 2)\n       = 3 - 2(3) + 5\n       = 3 - 6 + 5\n       = 2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, we will find the adjoint of matrix A and then divide each element by the determinant to get the inverse.\n\nadj(A) = |  3  -5  3 |\n         | -4   1  2 |\n         |  1   1 -1 |\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n      = (1/2) * |  3  -5  3 |\n                | -4   1  2 |\n                |  1   1 -1 |\n\nA_inv = |  1.5 -2.5  1.5 |\n        |  -2   0.5  1  |\n        |  0.5  0.5 -0.5 |\n\nNow, we will multiply A_inv with B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nX = A_inv * B\n  = |  1.5 -2.5  1.5 |   | 5 |\n    |  -2   0.5  1  | * | 1 |\n    |  0.5  0.5 -0.5 |   | 3 |\n\nX = | (1.5*5) + (-2.5*1) + (1.5*3) |\n    | (-2*5) + (0.5*1) + (1*3)     |\n    | (0.5*5) + (0.5*1) + (-0.5*3) |\n\nX = | 7.5 - 2.5 + 4.5 |\n    | -10 + 0.5 + 3   |\n    |  2.5 + 0.5 - 1.5 |\n\nX = | 9.5 |\n    | -6.5 |\n    |  1.5 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 9.5, y = -6.5, and z = 1.5."
