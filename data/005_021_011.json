    "message_1": "A company produces a batch of 500 smartphones. The company's quality control team tests a random sample of 50 smartphones and finds that the average battery life is 8.5 hours with a standard deviation of 2.3 hours. Using bootstrapping, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean battery life of all the smartphones in the batch.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean battery life of all the smartphones in the batch using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 10,000) from the original sample of 50 smartphones, each with the same sample size (50) and with replacement.\n2. Calculate the mean battery life for each bootstrap sample.\n3. Arrange the calculated means in ascending order.\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap means, which will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data to perform the bootstrapping, we can approximate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution:\n\n1. Calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean: SE = standard deviation / sqrt(sample size) = 2.3 / sqrt(50) ≈ 0.325\n2. Determine the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1): t ≈ 2.01 (using a t-table or calculator)\n3. Calculate the margin of error (ME): ME = t * SE ≈ 2.01 * 0.325 ≈ 0.653\n4. Determine the 95% confidence interval: (sample mean - ME, sample mean + ME) = (8.5 - 0.653, 8.5 + 0.653) ≈ (7.847, 9.153)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean battery life of all the smartphones in the batch is approximately (7.847 hours, 9.153 hours)."
