    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can first try to eliminate one of the variables by using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, the elimination method seems more straightforward.\n\nWe can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:\n\n(2x + 3y = 7) * 2\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nNow we have:\n4x + 6y = 14 (1st equation multiplied by 2)\n4x + 6y = 14 (2nd equation)\n\nWe can see that both equations are the same. This means that the two equations represent the same line in the xy-plane. Since they are the same line, they have infinitely many points in common, and therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations."
