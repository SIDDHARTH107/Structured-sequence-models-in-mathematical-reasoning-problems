    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we are given the distance traveled (320 km) and the time taken (4 hours) to travel between points A and B. We need to find the average velocity of the car on this trip.\n\nThe average velocity can be calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In this case, the average velocity (v_avg) can be calculated as:\n\nv_avg = (Total distance) / (Total time)\nv_avg = 320 km / 4 hours\nv_avg = 80 km/h\n\nSo, the average velocity of the car on this trip is 80 km/h."
