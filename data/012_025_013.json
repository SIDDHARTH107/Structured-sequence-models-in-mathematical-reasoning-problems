    "message_1": "Consider the following graph with vertices labeled from 1 to 5 and edges:\n    \n    1 -- 2\n    |    |\n    3 -- 4 -- 5\n\nCan you find a Hamiltonian cycle in this graph? If yes, write the sequence of vertices that form the cycle. If no, explain why there is no Hamiltonian cycle.",
    "message_2": "There is no Hamiltonian cycle in this graph. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In this graph, vertex 5 has a degree of 1, meaning it only has one edge connecting it to vertex 4. Therefore, it is impossible to form a cycle that includes vertex 5 and visits each vertex exactly once."
