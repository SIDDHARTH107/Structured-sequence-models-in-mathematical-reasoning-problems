    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set (Z) is a subset of every set, we need to show that every element in Z is also an element in any given set (in this case, sets X and Y).\n\nBy definition, a set A is a subset of set B (denoted as A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also an element of B. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nA ⊆ B if ∀x (x ∈ A → x ∈ B)\n\nNow, let's consider the empty set Z = {}. By definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in Z that are not in any other set (X or Y in this case).\n\nSo, for any element x in Z, it is trivially true that x is also in X and Y, since there are no elements in Z to begin with. In other words, the statement \"x ∈ Z → x ∈ X\" is true for all x, and the statement \"x ∈ Z → x ∈ Y\" is also true for all x.\n\nThus, we can conclude that Z is a subset of X and Y, and by extension, the empty set is a subset of every set."
