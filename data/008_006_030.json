    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix. For the given matrix A = [[8, -2], [4, 5]], we have:\n\ndet([[8 - λ, -2], [4, 5 - λ]]) = (8 - λ)(5 - λ) - (-2)(4) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nλ^2 - 13λ + 36 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for λ:\n\n(λ - 4)(λ - 9) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 4 and λ2 = 9.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\n1) For λ1 = 4:\n\n(A - λ1I) * X = 0\n\n([[8 - 4, -2], [4, 5 - 4]]) * X = 0\n\n([[4, -2], [4, 1]]) * X = 0\n\nWe can write the system of linear equations:\n\n4x - 2y = 0\n4x + y = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we get x = y/2. We can choose y = 2, so x = 1. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 4 is:\n\nX1 = [1, 2]\n\n2) For λ2 = 9:\n\n(A - λ2I) * X = 0\n\n([[8 - 9, -2], [4, 5 - 9]]) * X = 0\n\n([[-1, -2], [4, -4]]) * X = 0\n\nWe can write the system of linear equations:\n\n-x - 2y = 0\n4x - 4y = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we get x = -2y. We can choose y = 1, so x = -2. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 9 is:\n\nX2 = [-2, 1]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 4 and λ2 = 9, and their corresponding eigenvectors are X1 = [1, 2] and X2 = [-2, 1]."
