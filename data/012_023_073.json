    "message_2": "To find the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the given graph, we need to identify the largest set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the adjacency matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0 0 \n0 0 1 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0\n```\n\nWe can see that vertices 2, 3, and 4 form a complete subgraph (clique) since they are all connected to each other:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0 0 \n```\n\nAdditionally, vertices 4, 5, and 6 also form a complete subgraph (clique):\n\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0\n```\n\nThere are no larger cliques in the graph. Therefore, the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the given graph has 3 vertices, and the clique number of the graph G is 3."
