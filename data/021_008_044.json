Starting with the initial approximations x=1 and y=1, find the solutions correct to three decimal places after three iterations.",
    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nwhere f1(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 5 and f2(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 3.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f1/∂y = 3y^2\n∂f2/∂x = 2x\n∂f2/∂y = 2y\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 3x^2  3y^2 |\n          |  2x    2y  |\n\nNow, we apply Newton's method using the initial approximations x = 1 and y = 1:\n\n1. Compute the function values at the initial approximations:\n\nf1(1, 1) = 1^3 + 1^3 - 5 = -3\nf2(1, 1) = 1^2 + 1^2 - 3 = -1\n\n2. Compute the Jacobian matrix at the initial approximations:\n\nJ(1, 1) = | 3  3 |\n          | 2  2 |\n\n3. Solve the linear system J(1, 1) * Δ = -F(1, 1), where Δ = (Δx, Δy) and F(1, 1) = (f1(1, 1), f2(1, 1)):\n\n| 3  3 | | Δx |   |  3 |\n| 2  2 | | Δy | = |  1 |\n\nThis linear system has infinitely many solutions, but we can choose one by setting Δy = 0. Then, Δx = 1. So, the first iteration gives us:\n\nx1 = x0 + Δx = 1 + 1 = 2\ny1 = y0 + Δy = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nNow, we repeat the process for the second and third iterations:\n\nIteration 2:\nf1(2, 1) = 2^3 + 1^3 - 5 = 3\nf2(2, 1) = 2^2 + 1^2 - 3 = 2\n\nJ(2, 1) = | 12  3 |\n          |  4  2 |\n\nSolving the linear system:\n\n| 12  3 | | Δx |   | -3 |\n|  4  2 | | Δy | = | -2 |\n\nWe get Δx = -0.25 and Δy = -0.5. So:\n\nx2 = x1 + Δx = 2 - 0.25 = 1.75\ny2 = y1 + Δy = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nIteration 3:\nf1(1.75, 0.5) ≈ 1.75^3 + 0.5^3 - 5 ≈ -0.421875\nf2(1.75, 0.5) ≈ 1.75^2 + 0.5^2 - 3 ≈ -0.0625\n\nJ(1.75, 0.5) ≈ | 9.1875  0.75  |\n               | 3.5     1     |\n\nSolving the linear system:\n\n| 9.1875  0.75  | | Δx |   |  0.421875 |\n|  3.5     1     | | Δy | = |  0.0625   |\n\nWe get Δx ≈ 0.046875 and Δy ≈ 0.0625. So:\n\nx3 = x2 + Δx ≈ 1.75 + 0.046875 ≈ 1.797\ny3 = y2 + Δy ≈ 0.5 + 0.0625 ≈ 0.563\n\nAfter three iterations, the approximate solutions for x and y are:\n\nx ≈ 1.797\ny ≈ 0.563\n\nThese values are correct to three decimal places."
