    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 2  1  1 | 7 |\n| 4  2  2 | 14|\n| 6  3  3 | 21|\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  0.5  0.5 | 3.5 |\n| 4  2    2   | 14  |\n| 6  3    3   | 21  |\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 6 times the first row from the third row to eliminate the leading coefficients in the second and third rows:\n\n| 1  0.5  0.5 | 3.5 |\n| 0  0    0   | 0   |\n| 0  0    0   | 0   |\n\nNow, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. To express the solution as an ordered triple (x, y, z), we can rewrite the first row as an equation:\n\nx + 0.5y + 0.5z = 3.5\n\nNow, we can express y and z in terms of a parameter t:\n\ny = 2t\nz = 2t\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for x:\n\nx + 0.5(2t) + 0.5(2t) = 3.5\nx + t + t = 3.5\nx + 2t = 3.5\n\nNow, we can express x in terms of t:\n\nx = 3.5 - 2t\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations can be expressed as an ordered triple (x, y, z) = (3.5 - 2t, 2t, 2t), where t is any real number."
