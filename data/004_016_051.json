    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, let's consider the function s(t) representing the position of the car at time t. We are given that the car travels 100 km in the first two hours, so we have:\n\ns(0) = 0 (assuming the car starts at position 0)\ns(2) = 100\n\nWe want to find the average speed of the car over the interval [0, 2]. The average speed is given by the average rate of change of the position function over this interval:\n\nAverage speed = (s(2) - s(0)) / (2 - 0) = (100 - 0) / 2 = 50 km/h\n\nNow, we apply the Mean Value Theorem. Since the car is moving continuously, we can assume that the position function s(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 2] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 2). Therefore, there must exist at least one point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the position function at c (which represents the instantaneous speed of the car) is equal to the average speed:\n\ns'(c) = 50 km/h\n\nSo, at some point during the first two hours of the journey, the car was going at a speed of 50 km/h."
