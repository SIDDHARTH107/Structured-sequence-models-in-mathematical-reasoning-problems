    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 28, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 16: 2^4 (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)\nPrime factorization of 28: 2^2 × 7 (2 × 2 × 7)\n\nNow, we take the highest powers of all the prime factors and multiply them together:\n\nLCM(16, 28) = 2^4 × 7 = 16 × 7 = 112\n\nSo, the least common multiple of 16 and 28 is 112."
