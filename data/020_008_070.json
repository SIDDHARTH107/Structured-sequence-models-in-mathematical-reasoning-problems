    "message_1": "A company has three factories producing the same type of product and three warehouses in different cities. The demand for the product in each city is 2300, 1600, and 2100 units, respectively. The transportation cost per unit from each factory to each warehouse is given as follows:\n\n- Factory 1: $5, $7, $3\n- Factory 2: $8, $4, $6\n- Factory 3: $4, $9, $5\n\nThe company wants to meet the demand at each warehouse while minimizing the total transportation cost. What is the optimal distribution of products from each factory to each warehouse?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let's define the variables:\n\nLet x_ij be the number of units transported from factory i to warehouse j.\n\nObjective function: Minimize the total transportation cost\nZ = 5x_11 + 7x_12 + 3x_13 + 8x_21 + 4x_22 + 6x_23 + 4x_31 + 9x_32 + 5x_33\n\nConstraints:\n1. The demand at each warehouse must be met:\nx_11 + x_21 + x_31 = 2300 (Warehouse 1)\nx_12 + x_22 + x_32 = 1600 (Warehouse 2)\nx_13 + x_23 + x_33 = 2100 (Warehouse 3)\n\n2. The supply from each factory must not exceed its production capacity:\nx_11 + x_12 + x_13 <= Factory 1 capacity\nx_21 + x_22 + x_23 <= Factory 2 capacity\nx_31 + x_32 + x_33 <= Factory 3 capacity\n\n3. Non-negativity constraints:\nx_ij >= 0 for all i, j\n\nTo find the optimal distribution, we need to know the production capacity of each factory. Please provide the production capacity of each factory."
