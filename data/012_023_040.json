    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge).\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\nVertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G (7 vertices)\nEdges: AB, AC, BC, BD, CD, DE, EF (7 edges)\n\nWe can see that there is a complete subgraph with vertices A, B, and C, as all three vertices are connected to each other (AB, AC, BC). There is no larger complete subgraph in this graph.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
