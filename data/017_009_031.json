    "message_2": "First, note that the order of G is 9, which is a power of a prime (3^2). By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since 9 is divisible by 3, there are either 1 or 3 Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nCase 1: There is only 1 Sylow 3-subgroup of G.\nIn this case, H is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, and by the Sylow theorems, H is normal in G. Since the order of H is 3 and the order of G is 9, the index of H in G is 3. Since H is normal in G, we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is 3, so G/H is cyclic. Since G/H is cyclic and H is normal in G, G is a semidirect product of H and G/H. However, since there is only one nontrivial automorphism of H (which is of order 2), the semidirect product is actually a direct product, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and G/H, which is a cyclic group of order 9. In this case, H = G and G is cyclic.\n\nCase 2: There are 3 Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\nIn this case, let K be another Sylow 3-subgroup of G that is not equal to H. Since the order of H and K is 3, their intersection must be the identity element. Therefore, any element in G that is not in H must be in K. Let b be an element in K that is not the identity. Then, the order of b is also 3. Now, consider the element c = ab. Since a and b have order 3, c has order 3 as well. Note that c is not in H, since H is generated by a, and c is not in K, since K is generated by b. This is a contradiction, as every element in G must be in either H or K.\n\nThus, we conclude that there must be only 1 Sylow 3-subgroup of G, and H = G and G is cyclic."
