    "message_2": "An elliptic curve over a field of characteristic 5 can be represented by the equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B (mod 5)\n\nWe have three points (1,1), (2,0) and (3,-1) that lie on the curve. We can substitute these points into the equation to get three equations:\n\n(1) 1^2 = 1^3 + A(1) + B (mod 5)\n(2) 0^2 = 2^3 + A(2) + B (mod 5)\n(3) (-1)^2 = 3^3 + A(3) + B (mod 5)\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\n(1) 1 = 1 + A + B (mod 5)\n(2) 0 = 8 + 2A + B (mod 5)\n(3) 1 = 27 + 3A + B (mod 5)\n\nNow, we can rewrite these equations in terms of A and B:\n\n(1) A + B = 0 (mod 5)\n(2) 2A + B = 3 (mod 5)\n(3) 3A + B = 4 (mod 5)\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations modulo 5. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n\nA = 3 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of A back into equation (1):\n\n3 + B = 0 (mod 5)\nB = 2 (mod 5)\n\nSo, the equation of the elliptic curve is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 3x + 2 (mod 5)"
