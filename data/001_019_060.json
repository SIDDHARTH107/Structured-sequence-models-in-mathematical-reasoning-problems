    "message_2": "To solve the equation |x - 3| = 6, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x - 3 >= 0\nIn this case, |x - 3| = x - 3, so the equation becomes:\nx - 3 = 6\nx = 6 + 3\nx = 9\n\nCase 2: x - 3 < 0\nIn this case, |x - 3| = -(x - 3), so the equation becomes:\n-(x - 3) = 6\n-1 * (x - 3) = 6\n-x + 3 = 6\n-x = 6 - 3\n-x = 3\nx = -3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 9 and -3."
