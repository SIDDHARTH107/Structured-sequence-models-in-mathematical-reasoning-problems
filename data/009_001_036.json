If a population of rabbits is initially 100 and it doubles in size in 2 years, what is the size of the population after 5 years? Use a differential equation to model the population growth.",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth using a differential equation, let P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t (in years). Since the rate of growth is proportional to their size, we can write the differential equation as:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere k is the proportionality constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of k. We know that the population doubles in 2 years, so:\n\nP(0) = 100\nP(2) = 200\n\nNow, we can solve the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nSeparate the variables:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫k dt\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the integration constant.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 100 to find the value of C:\n\nln(100) = k(0) + C\nC = ln(100)\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = kt + ln(100)\n\nUse the condition P(2) = 200 to find the value of k:\n\nln(200) = k(2) + ln(100)\n\nSolve for k:\n\nk = (ln(200) - ln(100))/2 = ln(2)\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = ln(2)t + ln(100)\n\nTo find the population after 5 years, plug in t = 5:\n\nln(P) = ln(2)(5) + ln(100)\n\nExponentiate both sides:\n\nP = e^(ln(2)(5) + ln(100))\n\nP = e^(ln(2^5) + ln(100))\n\nP = e^(ln(32) + ln(100))\n\nP = e^(ln(32*100))\n\nP = 32*100\n\nP = 3200\n\nSo, the size of the population after 5 years is 3200 rabbits."
