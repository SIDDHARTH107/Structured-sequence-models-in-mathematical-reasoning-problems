    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations. The method is based on the idea of decomposing the coefficient matrix into the sum of its diagonal and off-diagonal parts, and then iteratively updating the solution vector.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the given system of linear equations as follows:\n\nx = 9 - y - 2z\ny = 2x + 3z - 13\nz = -x + y - 3\n\nNow, we apply the Jacobi iterative method with the initial values (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0):\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 9 - y0 - 2z0 = 9 - 0 - 2(0) = 9\ny1 = 2x0 + 3z0 - 13 = 2(0) + 3(0) - 13 = -13\nz1 = -x0 + y0 - 3 = -0 + 0 - 3 = -3\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 9 - y1 - 2z1 = 9 - (-13) - 2(-3) = 9 + 13 + 6 = 28\ny2 = 2x1 + 3z1 - 13 = 2(9) + 3(-3) - 13 = 18 - 9 - 13 = -4\nz2 = -x1 + y1 - 3 = -9 - 13 - 3 = -25\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = 9 - y2 - 2z2 = 9 - (-4) - 2(-25) = 9 + 4 + 50 = 63\ny3 = 2x2 + 3z2 - 13 = 2(28) + 3(-25) - 13 = 56 - 75 - 13 = -32\nz3 = -x2 + y2 - 3 = -28 - 4 - 3 = -35\n\nAfter 3 iterations, the values of x, y, and z are approximately:\n\nx ≈ 63\ny ≈ -32\nz ≈ -35\n\nNote that the Jacobi iterative method does not guarantee convergence for all systems of linear equations, and the number of iterations required for convergence may vary depending on the initial values and the system itself."
