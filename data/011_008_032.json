    "message_2": "Since the 4 red balls must be consecutive, we can treat them as a single entity (a block of red balls). Now we have 3 objects to arrange: the block of red balls, the 2 blue balls, and the 1 green ball.\n\nThere are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these 3 objects, which is equal to 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible positions of the blue balls within these arrangements. There are 3 possible positions for the blue balls in each arrangement (before the red block, between the red and green, or after the green). \n\nSo, there are 6 arrangements * 3 positions for the blue balls = 18 ways to arrange the balls with the condition that the red balls are consecutive."
