    "message_2": "The given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nFirst, we can observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n(2 * 2x) + (2 * 3y) = 2 * 7\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nSince both equations are the same, this system of equations has infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n3y = 7 - 2x\ny = (7 - 2x) / 3\n\nSo the general solution for this system of equations is y = (7 - 2x) / 3, where x can be any real number."
