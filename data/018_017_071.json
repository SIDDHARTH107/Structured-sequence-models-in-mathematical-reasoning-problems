The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\n(A x B) △ B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\n(ii) Now, we need to find the symmetric difference of B and B. Since the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set, we have:\n\nB △ B = {}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product A x (B △ B). Since the symmetric difference is the empty set, the Cartesian product will also be the empty set:\n\nA x (B △ B) = {}\n\n(iii) Comparing the results of (i) and (ii), we have:\n\n(A x B) △ B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nA x (B △ B) = {}\n\nSince the results of (i) and (ii) are not equal, this shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
