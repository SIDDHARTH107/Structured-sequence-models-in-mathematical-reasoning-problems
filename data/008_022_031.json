    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n2 & 4 & 10 \\\\\n4 & 8.0001 & 20 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We'll start by dividing the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n1 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 8.0001 & 20 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 4 in the second row by subtracting 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n1 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 0.0001 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we'll divide the second row by 0.0001 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n1 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nFinally, we'll eliminate the 2 in the first row by subtracting 2 times the second row from the first row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n1 & 0 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form, and we can read off the solutions for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx &= 5 \\\\\ny &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is $x = 5$ and $y = 0$."
