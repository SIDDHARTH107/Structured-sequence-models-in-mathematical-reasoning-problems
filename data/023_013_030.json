    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution on the plate, we can use the two-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α(∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature at point (x, y) at time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n\n1. T(0, y, t) = 25°C for 0 ≤ y ≤ 5 cm\n2. T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 5, t) = T(3, y, t) = 0°C for 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 cm and 0 ≤ y ≤ 5 cm\n\nSince the problem is steady-state, the temperature distribution does not change with time, so ∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = 0. The heat equation becomes:\n\n0 = α(∂²T(x, y) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y) / ∂y²)\n\nWe can solve this equation using the Fourier transform. Let's first apply the Fourier sine transform with respect to x:\n\nF{∂²T(x, y) / ∂x²} = -n²π²T̃(n, y)\n\nwhere T̃(n, y) is the Fourier sine transform of T(x, y) with respect to x.\n\nNow, applying the Fourier sine transform with respect to y:\n\nF{∂²T(x, y) / ∂y²} = -m²π²T̃(n, m)\n\nThe transformed heat equation becomes:\n\n0 = α(-n²π²T̃(n, y) - m²π²T̃(n, m))\n\nSolving for T̃(n, m):\n\nT̃(n, m) = 0\n\nNow, we need to apply the inverse Fourier sine transform to find the temperature distribution T(x, y):\n\nT(x, y) = Σ[Σ[T̃(n, m) * sin(nπx/3) * sin(mπy/5)]]\n\nSince T̃(n, m) = 0, the temperature distribution T(x, y) is constant throughout the plate. This means that the temperature distribution is uniform, and the plate has reached a steady-state temperature. However, this result contradicts the given boundary conditions, which state that one side of the plate is at 25°C while the other three sides are at 0°C.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier transform method does not provide a valid solution for the given problem. An alternative approach, such as the separation of variables method, should be used to find the temperature distribution on the plate."
