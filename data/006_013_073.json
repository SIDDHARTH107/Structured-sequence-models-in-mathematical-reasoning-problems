    "message_1": "Here's a specific numerical problem related to the probability of a natural disaster occurring:\n\nWhat is the probability that a major earthquake (6.5 or higher on the Richter scale) will occur in a region within the next year, based on historical data?\n\nAssume that in the past 20 years, there were a total of 10 major earthquakes in the region. Also assume that the probability of a major earthquake occurring in any given year is constant (i.e., independent of the previous year's events).\n\nGiven these assumptions, what is the probability that a major earthquake will occur in the region within the next year? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "Based on the historical data provided, there were 10 major earthquakes in the past 20 years. To find the probability of a major earthquake occurring in any given year, we can divide the number of major earthquakes by the total number of years:\n\nProbability = (Number of major earthquakes) / (Total number of years)\nProbability = 10 / 20\n\nProbability = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability of a major earthquake occurring in the region within the next year is 0.5, or 50%. Rounded to two decimal places, the probability is 0.50."
