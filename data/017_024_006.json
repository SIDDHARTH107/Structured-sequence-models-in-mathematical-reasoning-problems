    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order p^n * m, where p is a prime not dividing m, is congruent to 1 mod p and divides m.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. So, we need to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, the possible orders are 2^5, 2^4, and 2^3. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, the possible order is 3^1. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 2^5 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: There is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Their product is a group of order 96, and this group is isomorphic to the direct product of the two subgroups. There is only one group in this case, which is the direct product of C_32 (cyclic group of order 32) and C_3 (cyclic group of order 3), denoted as C_32 x C_3.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: There is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. The unique Sylow 2-subgroup must be normal, so the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the whole group. There are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: C_32 x C_3 and (C_16 x C_2) x C_3.\n\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1: There are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The unique Sylow 3-subgroup must be normal, so the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the whole group. There are four non-isomorphic groups in this case: C_96, C_48 x C_2, C_32 x C_3, and C_16 x (C_2 x C_3).\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4: There are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, there are no normal subgroups, so there are no non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 = 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
