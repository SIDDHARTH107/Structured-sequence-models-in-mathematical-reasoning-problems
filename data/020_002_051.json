    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 1 hour of assembly time and 2 hours of painting time. Each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of painting time. The company has 200 hours of assembly time and 150 hours of painting time available per week.\n\nProduct A sells for $10 per unit, and Product B sells for $15 per unit. If the company wants to maximize their profits, how many units of each product should they produce per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the assembly and painting times can be represented as follows:\n\nAssembly time: 1x + 2y ≤ 200\nPainting time: 2x + 1y ≤ 150\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints in the slope-intercept form:\n\ny ≤ (200 - x) / 2\ny ≤ 150 - 2x\n\nNow, we'll plot these constraints:\n\n1. y = (200 - x) / 2\n   When x = 0, y = 100\n   When y = 0, x = 200\n\n2. y = 150 - 2x\n   When x = 0, y = 150\n   When y = 0, x = 75\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's the quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 100), (75, 0), and (50, 50).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 0): Profit = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. (0, 100): Profit = 10(0) + 15(100) = $1500\n3. (75, 0): Profit = 10(75) + 15(0) = $750\n4. (50, 50): Profit = 10(50) + 15(50) = $1250\n\nThe maximum profit of $1500 is achieved when the company produces 0 units of Product A and 100 units of Product B per week."
