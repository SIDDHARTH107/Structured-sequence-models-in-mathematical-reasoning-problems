    "message_2": "To find the possible isomorphism classes for groups of order 18, we can use the Sylow theorems. The order of a group is 18, which can be factored as 2 * 3^2. According to the Sylow theorems, there must exist Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nLet n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^2 = 9, and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 2, and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFrom these conditions, we find that n_2 can be 1 or 9, and n_3 can be 1 or 2.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are unique, they are normal in the group. Let P_2 be the Sylow 2-subgroup and P_3 be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Then the group is the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which are cyclic groups of order 2 and 9, respectively. Therefore, the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 2\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and two Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P_2 be the Sylow 2-subgroup and P_3, P_3' be the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in the group. However, neither P_3 nor P_3' is normal. The group is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, which are cyclic groups of order 2 and 9, respectively. This gives a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are nine Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is unique, it is normal in the group. Let P_3 be the Sylow 3-subgroup. The group is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6. This gives a group isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 18 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
