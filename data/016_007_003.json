    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In this case, we have a Menger sponge constructed with 216 smaller cubes, each measuring 1 cm on each side.\n\nTo find the volume of the Menger sponge, we first need to determine the level of recursion used to create it. The number of cubes in a Menger sponge can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the level of recursion.\n\nLet's find the level of recursion (n) for a Menger sponge with 216 cubes:\n\n20^n = 216\n\nTo solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nn * log(20) = log(216)\n\nn = log(216) / log(20)\n\nn â‰ˆ 1.618\n\nSince the level of recursion must be an integer, we can round n to the nearest integer, which is 2. Therefore, we have a Menger sponge with 2 levels of recursion.\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the Menger sponge. The volume of a single cube is:\n\nVolume of a cube = side^3 = 1 cm^3\n\nSince there are 216 cubes in the Menger sponge, the total volume is:\n\nVolume of Menger sponge = 216 * 1 cm^3 = 216 cm^3"
