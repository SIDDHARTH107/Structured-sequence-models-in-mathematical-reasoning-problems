    "message_1": "Consider two prime numbers $p=17$ and $q=23$. Using RSA encryption, find the encryption key $e$ and decryption key $d$, and use them to encrypt and decrypt the message \"5\".",
    "message_2": "To find the encryption key $e$ and decryption key $d$ using RSA encryption, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute $n = p \\times q = 17 \\times 23 = 391$.\n2. Compute the Euler's totient function $\\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 16 \\times 22 = 352$.\n3. Choose an integer $e$ such that $1 < e < \\phi(n)$ and $\\gcd(e, \\phi(n)) = 1$. A common choice is $e = 3$ or $e = 65537$. In this case, we can choose $e = 3$ since it satisfies the conditions.\n4. Compute the decryption key $d$ such that $d \\times e \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\phi(n)}$. In other words, find the modular inverse of $e$ modulo $\\phi(n)$. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find $d$.\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find $d$:\n\nWe want to find $d$ such that $3d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{352}$.\n\nExtended Euclidean Algorithm:\n1. gcd(352, 3) = 1\n2. 352 = 3 × 117 + 1\n3. 1 = 352 - 3 × 117\n4. 1 = 352 - 3 × (352 - 3 × 117)\n5. 1 = 3 × 3 × 117 - 352\n\nFrom the equation above, we have $d = 3 × 117 = 351$. So, the decryption key is $d = 351$.\n\nNow, we have the encryption key $e = 3$ and the decryption key $d = 351$. Let's use them to encrypt and decrypt the message \"5\".\n\nEncryption:\n$c = m^e \\pmod{n}$\n$c = 5^3 \\pmod{391}$\n$c = 125 \\pmod{391}$\n$c = 125$\n\nThe encrypted message is $c = 125$.\n\nDecryption:\n$m = c^d \\pmod{n}$\n$m = 125^{351} \\pmod{391}$\n$m = 5$\n\nThe decrypted message is $m = 5$, which is the original message."
