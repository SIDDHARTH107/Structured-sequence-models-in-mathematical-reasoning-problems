    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function and constraints.\n2. Initialize the parameters for the simulated annealing algorithm.\n3. Implement the simulated annealing algorithm.\n4. Analyze the results.\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function and constraints\n\nObjective function: f(x, y) = 3(x - 4)^2 + 4(y + 2)^2 - 5xy\n\nConstraints:\n- x^2 + y^2 ≤ 25\n- 2x + y ≥ 1\n\nStep 2: Initialize the parameters for the simulated annealing algorithm\n\n- Initial temperature T = 1000\n- Cooling rate alpha = 0.99\n- Number of iterations = 10000\n- Step size = 0.1\n\nStep 3: Implement the simulated annealing algorithm\n\n1. Start with a random initial solution (x, y) that satisfies the constraints.\n2. For each iteration:\n   a. Generate a random neighbor solution by perturbing the current solution (x, y) with a random step.\n   b. If the neighbor solution satisfies the constraints and has a lower objective function value, accept it as the new current solution.\n   c. If the neighbor solution does not satisfy the constraints or has a higher objective function value, accept it as the new current solution with a probability that depends on the temperature and the difference in objective function values.\n   d. Decrease the temperature by multiplying it with the cooling rate alpha.\n3. Repeat step 2 for the specified number of iterations.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the results\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm for the specified number of iterations, we will obtain a solution (x, y) that approximates the minimum value of the objective function, subject to the constraints.\n\nPlease note that the simulated annealing algorithm is a heuristic method and does not guarantee finding the global minimum. However, it is a useful approach for solving complex optimization problems with multiple local minima. You may need to run the algorithm multiple times with different initial solutions and parameters to obtain a better approximation of the minimum value."
