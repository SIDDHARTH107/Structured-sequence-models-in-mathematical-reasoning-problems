Is given the following problem to solve.\n\nDetermine the analytic continuation of the function $f(z)=\\frac{1}{z-2}$, defined on $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{2\\}$, across the line $\\operatorname{Re}(z)=1$ using the Schwarz reflection principle.\n\nThen, apply the result to evaluate the integral $\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dx}{x^2-4x+13}$.",
    "message_2": "To determine the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-2}$ across the line $\\operatorname{Re}(z) = 1$, we first need to find a function that is analytic on both sides of the line and agrees with $f(z)$ on the line. \n\nLet $g(z) = \\frac{1}{z-2}$, and let $z' = 2 - (z-2) = 4-z$. Then, the Schwarz reflection principle states that the function $h(z) = g(z') \\cdot g(z)$ is analytic on both sides of the line $\\operatorname{Re}(z) = 1$ and agrees with $f(z)$ on the line. \n\nSo, we have $h(z) = \\frac{1}{(4-z)-2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{z-2} = \\frac{1}{(2-z)(z-2)} = \\frac{1}{z^2-4z+4}$.\n\nNow, we can apply the result to evaluate the integral $\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dx}{x^2-4x+13}$. To do this, we first complete the square in the denominator:\n\n$x^2-4x+13 = (x-2)^2 + 9 = (x-2)^2 + (3i)^2$.\n\nNow, we can use the method of contour integration. Consider the integral $\\displaystyle\\oint_C \\frac{dz}{(z-2)^2 + (3i)^2}$, where $C$ is a semicircular contour in the upper half-plane with a large radius $R$. The integral along the semicircle vanishes as $R \\to \\infty$, so we are left with the integral along the real axis:\n\n$\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dx}{x^2-4x+13} = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(x-2)^2 + (3i)^2}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the residues of the poles inside the contour $C$. There is only one pole, at $z = 2 + 3i$. The residue at this pole is given by:\n\n$\\operatorname{Res}_{z=2+3i} \\frac{1}{(z-2)^2 + (3i)^2} = \\lim_{z \\to 2+3i} (z-(2+3i)) \\cdot \\frac{1}{(z-2)^2 + (3i)^2}$.\n\nUsing L'Hopital's rule, we get:\n\n$\\lim_{z \\to 2+3i} \\frac{1}{2(z-2)} = \\frac{1}{2(3i)} = -\\frac{i}{6}$.\n\nNow, by the residue theorem, we have:\n\n$\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dx}{x^2-4x+13} = 2\\pi i \\cdot (-\\frac{i}{6}) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\nSo, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$."
