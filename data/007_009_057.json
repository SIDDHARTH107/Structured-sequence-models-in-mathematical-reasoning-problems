    "message_2": "Euler's Totient Function, Φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). To calculate Φ(33), we can use the formula:\n\nΦ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 33, the prime factors are 3 and 11. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nΦ(33) = 33 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/11)\nΦ(33) = 33 * (2/3) * (10/11)\nΦ(33) = (66/3) * (10/11)\nΦ(33) = 22 * 10/11\nΦ(33) = 22 * 10 / 11\nΦ(33) = 22 * 1\nΦ(33) = 22\n\nSo, the value of Euler's Totient Function Φ(33) is 22."
