    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to the Volunteer's Dilemma:\n\nIn a group of 10 volunteers, each volunteer can either contribute $5 or not contribute anything to a charity. If at least 7 volunteers contribute, the charity will receive a total of $50. However, if fewer than 7 volunteers contribute, the charity gets nothing. Assume that each volunteer wants to contribute only if at least 6 others do as well. What is the equilibrium outcome of this game? (i.e., how many volunteers contribute and how much money does the charity receive?)",
    "message_2": "In this Volunteer's Dilemma, each volunteer wants to contribute only if at least 6 others do as well. This means that each volunteer is waiting for 6 other volunteers to contribute before they decide to contribute themselves.\n\nSince all volunteers have the same condition, they will all wait for 6 others to contribute. However, this situation will never happen, as each volunteer is waiting for the others to contribute first. As a result, no volunteer will contribute, and the charity will receive nothing.\n\nThe equilibrium outcome of this game is that 0 volunteers contribute, and the charity receives $0."
