How many ways can the singers be distributed among the groups if each group must contain at least 1 singer? Use Stirling numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are denoted as S(n, k) and represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we have 8 singers (n = 8) and 3 groups (k = 3).\n\nThe Stirling number S(8, 3) can be found using the following recurrence relation:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe need to find S(8, 3) using this relation. First, we need to know the base cases:\n\nS(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0\nS(0, 0) = 1\nS(n, n) = 1 for n > 0\n\nNow, we can calculate the Stirling numbers we need:\n\nS(1, 1) = 1\nS(2, 1) = 1\nS(2, 2) = 1\nS(3, 1) = 1\nS(3, 2) = 3\nS(3, 3) = 1\nS(4, 1) = 1\nS(4, 2) = 7\nS(4, 3) = 6\nS(4, 4) = 1\nS(5, 1) = 1\nS(5, 2) = 15\nS(5, 3) = 25\nS(5, 4) = 10\nS(5, 5) = 1\nS(6, 1) = 1\nS(6, 2) = 31\nS(6, 3) = 90\nS(6, 4) = 65\nS(6, 5) = 15\nS(6, 6) = 1\nS(7, 1) = 1\nS(7, 2) = 63\nS(7, 3) = 301\nS(7, 4) = 350\nS(7, 5) = 140\nS(7, 6) = 21\nS(7, 7) = 1\n\nFinally, we can find S(8, 3) using the recurrence relation:\n\nS(8, 3) = 3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2)\nS(8, 3) = 3 * 301 + 63\nS(8, 3) = 903 + 63\nS(8, 3) = 966\n\nSo there are 966 ways to distribute the 8 singers among the 3 groups, with each group containing at least 1 singer."
