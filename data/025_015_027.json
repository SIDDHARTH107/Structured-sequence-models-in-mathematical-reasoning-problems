    "message_2": "To find the equation of a plane, we need a point on the plane and the normal vector to the plane. We are given two points on the plane: P1 = (2, 1, 1) and P2 = (3, -1, -1). We can use these points to find a direction vector of the plane, but we also need another point on the plane that is not on the line defined by P1 and P2.\n\nLet's find the gradient of the algebraic surface at the given points. The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∇F(x, y, z) = (dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz)\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\ndF/dx = 2x - 5y - 2z - 5\ndF/dy = 4y - 5x - 2z + 7\ndF/dz = -10z - 2x - 2y + 12\n\nNow, let's find the gradient at the given points P1 and P2:\n\n∇F(P1) = (1, 3, -5)\n∇F(P2) = (-3, 5, 1)\n\nSince the gradient is normal to the surface, we can use the cross product of these two gradient vectors to find a direction vector of the plane:\n\nD = ∇F(P1) × ∇F(P2) = (22, -16, 14)\n\nNow we have a direction vector D and two points P1 and P2 on the plane. We can use the point-normal form of a plane equation:\n\nD • (P - P1) = 0\n\nWhere P = (x, y, z) and D • P denotes the dot product of vectors D and P. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n(22, -16, 14) • ((x, y, z) - (2, 1, 1)) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n22(x - 2) - 16(y - 1) + 14(z - 1) = 0\n\nExpanding and rearranging the terms, we obtain the equation of the plane:\n\n22x - 16y + 14z = 20"
