    "message_2": "To find the harmonic conjugate u(x, y) of the given function f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2, we need to use the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Let's denote f(x, y) as v(x, y) and u(x, y) as the harmonic conjugate we want to find. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial derivatives of v(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\n∂v/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y^2\n∂v/∂y = -6xy\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find the partial derivatives of u(x, y):\n\n∂u/∂x = -6xy\n∂u/∂y = 3x^2 - 3y^2\n\nNext, we need to integrate these partial derivatives to find u(x, y):\n\nIntegrating ∂u/∂x with respect to x, we get:\n\nu(x, y) = -3x^2y + g(y)\n\nwhere g(y) is an arbitrary function of y.\n\nNow, we differentiate u(x, y) with respect to y and compare it with the given ∂u/∂y:\n\n∂u/∂y = -3x^2 + g'(y)\n\nComparing this with the given ∂u/∂y, we have:\n\ng'(y) = -3y^2\n\nIntegrating g'(y) with respect to y, we get:\n\ng(y) = -y^3 + C\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nNow, we can write the complete expression for u(x, y):\n\nu(x, y) = -3x^2y - y^3 + C\n\nFinally, we apply the boundary condition u(x, y) = 0 on the unit circle (x^2 + y^2 = 1):\n\n0 = -3x^2y - y^3 + C\n\nSince this must hold for all points on the unit circle, we can conclude that C = 0. Therefore, the harmonic conjugate u(x, y) is:\n\nu(x, y) = -3x^2y - y^3"
