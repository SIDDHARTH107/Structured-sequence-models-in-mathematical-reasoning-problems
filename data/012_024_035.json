    "message_2": "To determine the genus of G, we can use the Euler's formula for connected planar graphs, which states that:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, since G is not necessarily planar, we need to find the genus g, which is the minimum number of handles we need to add to a sphere to embed the graph without any edge crossings. We can use the formula for the maximum number of edges in a graph of genus g:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nGiven that G has 9 vertices (V = 9) and 12 edges (E = 12), we can plug these values into the inequality:\n\n12 ≤ 3(9) + 6g - 6\n\nSolving for g, we get:\n\n12 ≤ 27 + 6g - 6\n6g ≥ -9\ng ≥ -1.5\n\nSince the genus must be a non-negative integer, the minimum value for g is 0. However, we need to check if G can be embedded in a sphere (g = 0) without any edge crossings. For a graph to be planar, it must satisfy the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for G:\n\n12 ≤ 3(9) - 6\n12 ≤ 27 - 6\n12 ≤ 21\n\nSince the inequality holds, G can be embedded in a sphere without any edge crossings, and its genus is 0. Therefore, the genus of G is 0."
