    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of `x` such that `5^x ≡ 20 mod 47`. We can do this by trying different values of `x` and checking if the equation holds true.\n\n1. x = 1: 5^1 % 47 = 5\n2. x = 2: 5^2 % 47 = 25\n3. x = 3: 5^3 % 47 = 16\n4. x = 4: 5^4 % 47 = 33\n5. x = 5: 5^5 % 47 = 38\n6. x = 6: 5^6 % 47 = 9\n7. x = 7: 5^7 % 47 = 45\n8. x = 8: 5^8 % 47 = 14\n9. x = 9: 5^9 % 47 = 23\n10. x = 10: 5^10 % 47 = 41\n11. x = 11: 5^11 % 47 = 28\n12. x = 12: 5^12 % 47 = 6\n13. x = 13: 5^13 % 47 = 30\n14. x = 14: 5^14 % 47 = 4\n15. x = 15: 5^15 % 47 = 20\n\nWe found that when `x = 15`, the equation `5^x ≡ 20 mod 47` holds true.
