    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the wave speed (c) and the wavelength (λ) of the wave on the string. \n\nFirst, let's find the wave speed (c). The wave speed on a string can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$c = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$\n\nwhere T is the tension in the string (100 N) and μ is the linear mass density of the string. Since we don't have the value of μ, we'll assume the string is under fundamental frequency (first harmonic) condition, which means that the string has one-half of a wavelength on it:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda = 1\\,\\text{m}$\n\nSo, the wavelength (λ) is:\n\n$\\lambda = 2\\,\\text{m}$\n\nNow, we can use the frequency (f) to find the wave speed (c). The relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength is:\n\n$c = f\\lambda$\n\nGiven the frequency (f) is 100 Hz, we can calculate the wave speed (c):\n\n$c = 100\\,\\text{Hz} \\times 2\\,\\text{m} = 200\\,\\text{m/s}$\n\nSo, the wave speed (c) is 200 m/s, and the wavelength (λ) is 2 meters."
