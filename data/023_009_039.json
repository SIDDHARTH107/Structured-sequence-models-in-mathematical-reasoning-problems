    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nThe heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = k ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere k is the thermal diffusivity constant. Substituting the assumed form of u(x,t) into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) dT(t)/dt = k T(t) d²X(x)/dx²\n\nNow, we divide both sides by kX(x)T(t):\n\n(1/kT(t)) dT(t)/dt = (1/X(x)) d²X(x)/dx²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/kT(t)) dT(t)/dt = -λ\n(1/X(x)) d²X(x)/dx² = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. d²X(x)/dx² = -λX(x) with boundary conditions X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0\n2. dT(t)/dt = -kλT(t)\n\nFirst, we solve the spatial ODE (1):\n\nThe general solution of this ODE is:\n\nX(x) = A sin(√λx) + B cos(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0\nX(1) = A sin(√λ) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (trivial solution), sin(√λ) = 0, which means √λ = nπ for some integer n. Thus, λ = n²π², and the spatial part of the solution is:\n\nX_n(x) = A_n sin(nπx)\n\nNow we solve the temporal ODE (2):\n\ndT(t)/dt = -kλT(t)\n\nThe general solution of this ODE is:\n\nT(t) = C exp(-kλt)\n\nSubstituting λ = n²π², we get:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n exp(-k n²π²t)\n\nNow, the full solution u(x,t) is the sum of the product of the spatial and temporal parts:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [A_n sin(nπx) * C_n exp(-k n²π²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = x:\n\nx = Σ [A_n sin(nπx) * C_n]\n\nSince C_n = 1 for t = 0, we have:\n\nx = Σ [A_n sin(nπx)]\n\nWe can find A_n using the orthogonality property of sine functions and the fact that the interval is [0,1]:\n\nA_n = 2 ∫[0,1] x sin(nπx) dx\n\nIntegrating by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nπx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/nπ) cos(nπx)\n\nA_n = 2[-(1/nπ) x cos(nπx) |[0,1] + (1/nπ) ∫[0,1] cos(nπx) dx]\n\nA_n = 2[-(1/nπ) (cos(nπ) - 1) + (1/n²π²) sin(nπx) |[0,1]]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer n, we have:\n\nA_n = 2[-(1/nπ) (cos(nπ) - 1)]\n\nNow, the final solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [2(-(1/nπ) (cos(nπ) - 1)) sin(nπx) * exp(-k n²π²t)]\n\nThis is the solution of the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions using the Fourier transform."
