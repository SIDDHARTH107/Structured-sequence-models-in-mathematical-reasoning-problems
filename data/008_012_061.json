    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 14  |\n    | -7  |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -3 |\n         | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                  | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/22  3/22 |\n         | 4/22 -2/22 |\n\nNow, we multiply A^(-1) by B to find the values of X:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/22  3/22 | * | 14  |\n    |  4/22 -2/22 |   | -7  |\n\nX = | (5/22)*14 + (3/22)*(-7) |\n    | (4/22)*14 + (-2/22)*(-7) |\n\nX = | 70/22 - 21/22 |\n    | 56/22 + 14/22  |\n\nX = | 49/22 |\n    | 70/22  |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 49/22\ny = 70/22"
