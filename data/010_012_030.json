    "message_2": "a) The function f(x) = |x| is not differentiable at x = 0. To see why, let's examine the left and right derivatives at x = 0.\n\nFor x < 0, f(x) = -x, and the derivative is f'(x) = -1.\nFor x > 0, f(x) = x, and the derivative is f'(x) = 1.\n\nThe left and right derivatives at x = 0 are not equal, which means that the function is not differentiable at x = 0.\n\nb) A smooth function is a function that is differentiable at every point in its domain. Since f(x) = |x| is not differentiable at x = 0, it is not a smooth function on the interval [-1, 1]."
