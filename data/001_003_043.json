    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the second equation for y:\n\n5x - y = 7\ny = 5x - 7\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n3x + 2(5x - 7) = 14\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n3x + 10x - 14 = 14\n13x = 28\nx = 28/13\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the expression for y:\n\ny = 5(28/13) - 7\ny = 140/13 - 91/13\ny = 49/13\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 28/13\ny = 49/13"
