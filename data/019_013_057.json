    "message_2": "In second-order logic, the total number of functions from a 3-element set to a 4-element set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nnumber of functions = (size of the codomain)^(size of the domain)\n\nIn this case, the domain has 3 elements and the codomain has 4 elements. So, the total number of functions can be calculated as:\n\nnumber of functions = 4^3 = 64\n\nThere are 64 possible functions from a 3-element set to a 4-element set in second-order logic."
