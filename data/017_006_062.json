    "message_2": "First, we note that 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group of order 35 can be written as a direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups (n_5) divides 7 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups (n_7) divides 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 7, so n_7 = 1. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G (as they are the unique subgroups of their respective orders), we can consider their product PQ. We have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have prime orders, their intersection is either trivial or equal to one of the subgroups. However, if P ∩ Q = P or P ∩ Q = Q, then one of the subgroups would be contained in the other, which is not possible since their orders are distinct primes. Therefore, P ∩ Q is trivial, and |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 35.\n\nNow, since |PQ| = |G|, we have that PQ = G. Thus, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, G ≅ P × Q. Since P and Q are cyclic (as they have prime order), G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, G ≅ C_5 × C_7.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the cyclic group of order 35, C_35. Since gcd(5, 7) = 1, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, C_35 is isomorphic to C_5 × C_7.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one group of order 35 up to isomorphism, and it is isomorphic to either a cyclic group C_35 or a direct product of two cyclic groups C_5 × C_7."
