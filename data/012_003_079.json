    "message_2": "To determine the size of the maximum independent set in a graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges, we can use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 9 = 18.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario for the maximum independent set, which is when the graph is a complete graph (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In a complete graph with 7 vertices, each vertex has a degree of 6, and the sum of the degrees is 7 * 6 = 42. However, we know that the sum of the degrees in our graph is 18, which is less than 42. This means that our graph is not a complete graph and has some vertices with a degree less than 6.\n\nSince the graph is not complete, there must be at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices, which can be included in the independent set. Therefore, the size of the maximum independent set is at least 2.\n\nTo find the exact size of the maximum independent set, we would need more information about the specific structure of the graph. However, we can conclude that the size of the maximum independent set is at least 2."
