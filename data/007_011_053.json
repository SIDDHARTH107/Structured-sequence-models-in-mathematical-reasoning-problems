To find all quadratic residues modulo 13, we will calculate the squares of the integers from 0 to 12 (half of 13) and then reduce them modulo 13.\n\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 13)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 13)\n3² ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n4² ≡ 16 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n5² ≡ 25 ≡ 12 (mod 13)\n6² ≡ 36 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n\nSince 13 is a prime number, we only need to check up to half of 13, as the remaining integers will have the same quadratic residues as their inverses. Thus, the quadratic residues modulo 13 are {0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12}."
