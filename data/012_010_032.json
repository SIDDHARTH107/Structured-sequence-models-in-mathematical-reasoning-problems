    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest possible vertex cover for the given graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges.\n\nWe can use the inequality involving the size of the vertex cover (denoted as VC), the number of vertices (n), and the number of edges (m) in a graph:\n\nVC ≥ 2m / (n + 1)\n\nIn our case, n = 8 and m = 12. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\nVC ≥ 2 * 12 / (8 + 1)\nVC ≥ 24 / 9\nVC ≥ 2.67\n\nSince the vertex cover must be an integer, we round up to the smallest possible integer value:\n\nVC ≥ 3\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible vertex cover for the given graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges is 3."
