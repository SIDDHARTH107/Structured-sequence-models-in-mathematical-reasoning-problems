    "message_1": "Consider a market in which two firms, Firm A and Firm B, compete as Cournot oligopolists. Firm A has a marginal cost (MC) of $20 per unit while Firm B has an MC of $30 per unit. The inverse demand function for the market is given by P=100-Q, where Q=QA+QB is the total quantity produced by both firms. Calculate the Nash equilibrium quantity and price of the market, assuming that the firms split the market equally.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium quantity and price, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function represents the best response of a firm to the quantity produced by its competitor.\n\nFirm A's profit function is given by:\nΠA = (P - MC_A) * QA\nΠA = [(100 - Q) - 20] * QA\nΠA = (80 - QA - QB) * QA\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm A will choose QA such that its marginal profit is zero. Therefore, we differentiate ΠA with respect to QA and set the result equal to zero:\n\ndΠA/dQA = 80 - 2QA - QB = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for QA in terms of QB:\nQA = (80 - QB) / 2\n\nThis is Firm A's reaction function.\n\nSimilarly, we can find Firm B's profit function:\nΠB = (P - MC_B) * QB\nΠB = [(100 - Q) - 30] * QB\nΠB = (70 - QA - QB) * QB\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm B will choose QB such that its marginal profit is zero. Therefore, we differentiate ΠB with respect to QB and set the result equal to zero:\n\ndΠB/dQB = 70 - 2QB - QA = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for QB in terms of QA:\nQB = (70 - QA) / 2\n\nThis is Firm B's reaction function.\n\nSince the firms split the market equally, we can set QA = QB:\n\n(80 - QB) / 2 = (70 - QA) / 2\n\nNow, we can solve for QA and QB:\n\nQA = 80 - QB\nQB = 70 - QA\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation:\n\nQB = 70 - (80 - QB)\n2QB = 70 - 80 + QB\nQB = -10 + QA\n\nNow, substituting this back into the first equation:\n\nQA = 80 - (-10 + QA)\nQA = 90 - QA\n2QA = 90\nQA = 45\n\nNow, we can find QB:\n\nQB = -10 + QA\nQB = -10 + 45\nQB = 35\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium quantities are QA = 45 and QB = 35.\n\nNow, we can find the total quantity Q and the market price P:\n\nQ = QA + QB\nQ = 45 + 35\nQ = 80\n\nP = 100 - Q\nP = 100 - 80\nP = 20\n\nThus, the Nash equilibrium price is $20, and the equilibrium quantities are 45 units for Firm A and 35 units for Firm B."
