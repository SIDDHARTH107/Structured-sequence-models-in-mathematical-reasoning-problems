    "message_1": "How many different programs can be written using a programming language that consists of only four instructions: assign value to variable, print value of variable, increment variable by 1, and conditional jump? Assume that each program can be at most 10 instructions long.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the number of different programs that can be written using this programming language, we need to consider all possible combinations of the four instructions for programs of length 1 to 10.\n\nFor a program of length 1, there are 4 options (one for each instruction). For a program of length 2, there are 4 options for the first instruction and 4 options for the second instruction, giving a total of 4 * 4 = 16 possible programs. In general, for a program of length n, there are 4^n possible programs.\n\nTo find the total number of programs with a maximum length of 10, we need to sum the number of programs for each length from 1 to 10:\n\nTotal programs = 4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 + 4^4 + 4^5 + 4^6 + 4^7 + 4^8 + 4^9 + 4^10\n\nTotal programs = 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024 + 4096 + 16384 + 65536 + 262144 + 1048576\n\nTotal programs = 1398100\n\nSo, there are 1,398,100 different programs that can be written using this programming language with a maximum length of 10 instructions."
