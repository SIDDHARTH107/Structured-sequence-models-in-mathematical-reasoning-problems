    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is $2^4 \\cdot 3$. We will consider the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, by the third Sylow theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, $n_2$, must divide 3 and satisfy $n_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Thus, $n_2$ can be 1 or 3. If $n_2 = 1$, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup of order 16, which must be normal. If $n_2 = 3$, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 16, and none of them are normal.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, by the third Sylow theorem, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, $n_3$, must divide 16 and satisfy $n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. Thus, $n_3$ can be 1 or 4. If $n_3 = 1$, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3, which must be normal. If $n_3 = 4$, there are four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 3, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. $n_2 = 1$ and $n_3 = 1$: In this case, both the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are normal. The group is a direct product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. There are 5 groups of order 16 (4 abelian and 1 non-abelian) and 1 group of order 3, so there are 5 possible groups in this case.\n\n2. $n_2 = 1$ and $n_3 = 4$: In this case, the 2-Sylow subgroup is normal, but the 3-Sylow subgroups are not. The group is a semidirect product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. There are 5 groups of order 16 and 4 non-normal subgroups of order 3. For each of the 5 groups of order 16, there are 2 possible semidirect products, giving a total of 10 possible groups in this case.\n\n3. $n_2 = 3$ and $n_3 = 1$: In this case, the 3-Sylow subgroup is normal, but the 2-Sylow subgroups are not. The group is a semidirect product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. There are 3 non-normal subgroups of order 16 and 1 group of order 3. For each of the 3 subgroups of order 16, there are 2 possible semidirect products, giving a total of 6 possible groups in this case.\n\n4. $n_2 = 3$ and $n_3 = 4$: In this case, neither the 2-Sylow nor the 3-Sylow subgroups are normal. There are no groups in this case, as at least one Sylow subgroup must be normal.\n\nIn total, there are 5 + 10 + 6 = 21 non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\nIt is not feasible to list all 21 groups by name, as many of them do not have standard names. However, some examples of these groups include:\n\n1. The abelian groups: $\\mathbb{Z}_{48}, \\mathbb{Z}_{2^4} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3, \\mathbb{Z}_{2^3} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3, \\mathbb{Z}_{2^2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2^2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3, \\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n2. The dihedral group of order 48: $D_{24}$.\n3. The quaternion group of order 48: $Q_{48}$.\n4. The semidirect products of $\\mathbb{Z}_{16} \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^3} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nThe remaining groups can be described as various semidirect products and extensions of the Sylow subgroups."
