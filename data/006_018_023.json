    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, financial frauds) in n trials (years)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, financial fraud occurring, which is 0.05)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 years)\n- k is the number of successes we're interested in (in this case, at least 2 financial frauds)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 2 financial frauds occurring, we can find the probabilities for 2, 3, 4, and 5 financial frauds and add them together. Alternatively, we can find the probabilities for 0 and 1 financial frauds and subtract them from 1.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for 0 and 1 financial frauds:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(5, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(5-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^5\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.7738\n\nP(X = 1) = C(5, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(5-1)\nP(X = 1) = 5 * 0.05 * (0.95)^4\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.2041\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 financial frauds occurring by subtracting the probabilities of 0 and 1 financial frauds from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.7738 - 0.2041\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 0.0221\n\nSo, the probability that financial fraud will occur in at least 2 out of the next 5 years is approximately 0.0221 or 2.21%."
