    "message_2": "Goldbach's Conjecture, proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742, states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values, and it has been found to be true in all tested cases. However, it remains an unproven conjecture.\n\nSince Goldbach's Conjecture is still unproven, we cannot definitively identify the smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. If the conjecture is proven to be true, then there would be no such even number. If it is proven to be false, then the smallest counterexample is yet to be discovered."
