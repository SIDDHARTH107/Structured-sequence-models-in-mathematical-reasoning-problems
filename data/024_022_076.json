    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In the context of Riemannian geometry, an isometry is a diffeomorphism (smooth invertible map) between two Riemannian manifolds that pulls back the metric tensor of the target manifold to the metric tensor of the source manifold.\n\nFor the Euclidean plane with the given metric $g = dx^2 + dy^2$, we are looking for transformations that preserve the distance between points. In this case, the isometries are the Euclidean transformations, which can be classified into three types:\n\n1. Translations: A translation is a transformation that moves every point in the plane by a fixed distance in a given direction. Mathematically, a translation can be represented as $T_{(a, b)}(x, y) = (x + a, y + b)$, where $(a, b)$ is the translation vector.\n\n2. Rotations: A rotation is a transformation that rotates every point in the plane around a fixed point (called the center of rotation) by a given angle. Mathematically, a rotation can be represented as $R_{\\theta}(x, y) = (x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta, x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of rotation.\n\n3. Reflections: A reflection is a transformation that reflects every point in the plane across a fixed line (called the axis of reflection). Mathematically, a reflection can be represented as $F_l(x, y) = (x', y')$, where $(x', y')$ is the reflection of $(x, y)$ across the line $l$.\n\nAny combination of these transformations (translation, rotation, and reflection) will also be an isometry. In general, an isometry of the Euclidean plane can be represented as a composition of a translation, a rotation, and possibly a reflection:\n\n$I(x, y) = T_{(a, b)} \\circ R_{\\theta} \\circ F_l(x, y)$,\n\nwhere $T_{(a, b)}$ is a translation, $R_{\\theta}$ is a rotation, and $F_l$ is either the identity transformation (no reflection) or a reflection across a line $l$."
