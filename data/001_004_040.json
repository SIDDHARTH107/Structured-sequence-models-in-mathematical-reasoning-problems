    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial, first look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. In this case, the GCF is 4x. \n\nNow, factor out the GCF:\n\n4x(x^2 - 3x + 2)\n\nNext, factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n4x(x - 1)(x - 2)"
