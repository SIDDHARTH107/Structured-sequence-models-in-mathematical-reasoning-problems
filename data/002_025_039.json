    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the length of the remaining side of an isosceles triangle in which the two equal sides have a length of 8 centimeters. What is the length of the third side measured in centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To determine the length of the remaining side of an isosceles triangle, we need more information. An isosceles triangle has two equal sides, but the length of the third side can vary. If we know the angle between the two equal sides or the height of the triangle, we can calculate the length of the third side. Please provide more information."
