    "message_2": "To simplify the given linear logic expression, we can use the following rules:\n\n1. (A ⊸ B) ⊗ (B ⊸ C) ⊸ A ⊸ C (Cut rule)\n2. A ⊸ A ⊗ B (Dereliction rule)\n3. A ⊗ B ⊸ B ⊗ A (Exchange rule)\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the given expression:\n\n(a ⊗ b) ⊸ (a ⊸ (b ⊸ c)) ⊸ c\n\nFirst, we can apply the Cut rule (rule 1) by considering A = a, B = b, and C = (b ⊸ c):\n\n(a ⊗ b) ⊸ (a ⊸ (b ⊸ c)) ⊸ c = (a ⊸ b ⊸ c) ⊸ c\n\nNext, we can apply the Dereliction rule (rule 2) by considering A = b and B = c:\n\n(a ⊸ b ⊸ c) ⊸ c = a ⊸ (b ⊸ c) ⊗ c\n\nFinally, we can apply the Exchange rule (rule 3) by considering A = b ⊸ c and B = c:\n\na ⊸ (b ⊸ c) ⊗ c = a ⊸ c ⊗ (b ⊸ c)\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\na ⊸ c ⊗ (b ⊸ c)"
