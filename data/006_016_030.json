    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, a certain type of defect occurs with a probability of 0.03. If a company produces 10,000 units of this product, what is the probability that at least 300 units will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula and the complement rule. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a defect (0.03 in this case)\n- n is the total number of units (10,000)\n- k is the number of defective units\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 300 defective units, which is the complement of having fewer than 300 defective units. So, we can use the complement rule:\n\nP(X ≥ 300) = 1 - P(X < 300)\n\nTo find P(X < 300), we need to sum the probabilities of having 0 to 299 defective units:\n\nP(X < 300) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 299\n\nCalculating this sum directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean μ = np and variance σ^2 = np(1-p). In this case:\n\nμ = np = 10,000 * 0.03 = 300\nσ^2 = np(1-p) = 10,000 * 0.03 * (1 - 0.03) = 291\nσ = √σ^2 = √291 ≈ 17.058\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) to approximate the probability. We need to find the Z-score for 299.5 (using a continuity correction):\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ = (299.5 - 300) / 17.058 ≈ -0.029\n\nUsing a Z-table or calculator, we find that P(Z < -0.029) ≈ 0.4884. So, the probability of having fewer than 300 defective units is approximately 0.4884. Now, we can use the complement rule to find the probability of having at least 300 defective units:\n\nP(X ≥ 300) = 1 - P(X < 300) = 1 - 0.4884 ≈ 0.5116\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least 300 units will have the defect is approximately 0.5116 or 51.16%."
