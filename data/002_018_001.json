    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, it touches all six faces of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of an edge of the cube.\n\nThe diameter of the sphere is 8 cm, so its radius (r) is half of that, which is 4 cm.\n\nNow we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(4 cm)^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(64 cm^3)\n\nV = (256/3)π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately (256/3)π cm^3 or approximately 268.08 cm^3."
