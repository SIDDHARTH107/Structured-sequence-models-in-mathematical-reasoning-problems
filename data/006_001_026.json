    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10 coin flips)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (in this case, 3 heads)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of getting a head, which is 0.5)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of getting a tail, which is also 0.5)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated using the formula: n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this problem, we have n = 10, k = 3, p = 0.5, and q = 0.5. First, let's calculate nCk:\n\n10C3 = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n= 10! / (3!7!)\n= (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 120\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = (120) * (0.5^3) * (0.5^7)\n= 120 * 0.125 * 0.0078125\n= 120 * 0.0009765625\n= 0.1171875\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 10 coin flips is 0.1171875, or 11.72% (rounded to two decimal places)."
