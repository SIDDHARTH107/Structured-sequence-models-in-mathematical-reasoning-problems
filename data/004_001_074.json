    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 9, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^4, the derivative is f'(x) = 4 * 3x^(4-1) = 12x^3.\nFor f(x) = -2x^3, the derivative is f'(x) = 3 * (-2)x^(3-1) = -6x^2.\nFor f(x) = 5x^2, the derivative is f'(x) = 2 * 5x^(2-1) = 10x.\nFor f(x) = -7x, the derivative is f'(x) = -7 (since x^1 becomes 1).\nFor f(x) = 9, the derivative is f'(x) = 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0).\n\nNow, we add up all the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7"
