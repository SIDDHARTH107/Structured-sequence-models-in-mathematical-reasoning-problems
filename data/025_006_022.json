    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of H^1(X, O_X), we can use the long exact sequence in cohomology associated to the short exact sequence of sheaves on X:\n\n0 → O_X(-3) → O_X ⊕ O_X ⊕ O_X → O_X(3) → 0,\n\nwhere the first map is given by (f, g, h) ↦ fx + gy + hz, and the second map is given by (f, g, h) ↦ f + g + h.\n\nNow, we compute the cohomology groups of the line bundles O_X(n) on X. We know that X is a smooth cubic surface in P^3, and by the adjunction formula, the canonical bundle of X is given by K_X = O_X(-4). Therefore, the Serre duality theorem implies that:\n\nH^1(X, O_X(n)) ≅ H^1(X, O_X(n) ⊗ K_X) = H^1(X, O_X(n-4)).\n\nUsing the Serre correspondence, we can compute the dimensions of the cohomology groups of the line bundles O_X(n) on X:\n\nh^0(X, O_X(n)) = (n+1)^2(n+2)/2 for n ≥ 0, and h^0(X, O_X(n)) = 0 for n < 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the dimensions of the cohomology groups of the line bundles O_X(n) on X:\n\nh^0(X, O_X(-3)) = 0,\nh^0(X, O_X) = 1,\nh^0(X, O_X(3)) = 20.\n\nUsing the long exact sequence in cohomology, we get:\n\n0 → H^0(X, O_X(-3)) → H^0(X, O_X) ⊕ H^0(X, O_X) ⊕ H^0(X, O_X) → H^0(X, O_X(3)) → H^1(X, O_X(-3)) → H^1(X, O_X) ⊕ H^1(X, O_X) ⊕ H^1(X, O_X) → H^1(X, O_X(3)) → 0.\n\nSince h^0(X, O_X(-3)) = 0, we have an isomorphism:\n\nH^0(X, O_X) ⊕ H^0(X, O_X) ⊕ H^0(X, O_X) ≅ H^0(X, O_X(3)).\n\nThus, the dimension of H^1(X, O_X(-3)) is 0. By Serre duality, we have:\n\nH^1(X, O_X) ≅ H^1(X, O_X(-4)).\n\nSince h^0(X, O_X(-4)) = 0, we conclude that the dimension of H^1(X, O_X) is also 0."
