    "message_2": "1. (A × B)' = (complement of A × B)\nTo find the complement of A × B, we first need to find A × B. The Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, to find the complement of A × B, we need to consider a universal set U. The complement of A × B is the set of all elements in U that are not in A × B. However, without knowing the universal set U, we cannot find the complement of A × B.\n\n2. A' × B' = (complement of A) × (complement of B)\nSimilarly, to find the complement of A and B, we need to know the universal set U. Without knowing U, we cannot find the complement of A and B, and therefore cannot find the Cartesian product of their complements.\n\n3. Compare the sets obtained in parts 1 and 2 and check if they are equal.\nSince we cannot find the complements of A × B and A' × B' without knowing the universal set U, we cannot compare the sets and determine if they are equal."
