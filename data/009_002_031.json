    "message_1": "A certain infectious disease has a population of 1000 people in a city. Let's assume that the rate of change of the number of infected people is proportional to the product of the number of infected people and the number of susceptible people. If the rate of transmission between susceptible and infected people is 0.1 per day, and the number of infected people doubles every 5 days, what is the maximum number of infected people that the city can sustain?",
    "message_2": "Let I(t) be the number of infected people at time t and S(t) be the number of susceptible people at time t. According to the problem, the rate of change of the number of infected people is proportional to the product of the number of infected people and the number of susceptible people:\n\ndI/dt = k * I(t) * S(t)\n\nwhere k is the rate of transmission between susceptible and infected people, which is given as 0.1 per day.\n\nSince the number of infected people doubles every 5 days, we can write:\n\nI(t + 5) = 2 * I(t)\n\nNow, let's find the constant k. We know that:\n\ndI/dt = k * I(t) * S(t)\n\nWhen t = 0, I(0) = 1 (assuming there's 1 infected person initially), and S(0) = 999 (since there are 1000 people in total). Thus:\n\ndI/dt = 0.1 * 1 * 999\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of infected people that the city can sustain. This occurs when the rate of change of the number of infected people is 0, i.e., dI/dt = 0. At this point, the number of susceptible people, S(t), will be at its minimum.\n\n0 = 0.1 * I(t) * S(t)\n\nSince I(t) cannot be 0 (as there are already infected people), we must have:\n\nS(t) = 0\n\nThis means that all people in the city have been infected. Therefore, the maximum number of infected people that the city can sustain is 1000."
