    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x), we need to analyze the coefficients of the sine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 3. Therefore, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient inside the sine term, which affects the frequency of the function. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π.\n\nSo, the function f(x) = 3sin(2x) has a period of π and an amplitude of 3."
