    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we first need to consider the prime factorization of 18, which is 2 × 3^2. There are two possibilities for the structure of a group of order 18: either it is a direct product of two smaller groups, or it is a simple group.\n\n1. If the group is a direct product of two smaller groups, then the possibilities are:\n\n   a) A group of order 2 and a group of order 9. There is only one group of order 2 (the cyclic group Z2) and two groups of order 9 (the cyclic group Z9 and the non-abelian group, the Heisenberg group). So, there are two possible direct products: Z2 × Z9 and Z2 × Heisenberg group.\n\n2. If the group is a simple group, then it must be a semi-direct product of two smaller groups. The only possibility is a semi-direct product of a group of order 2 and a group of order 9. However, since the group of order 9 is abelian, the semi-direct product is isomorphic to the direct product, which we have already counted.\n\nSo, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 18: Z2 × Z9 and Z2 × Heisenberg group."
