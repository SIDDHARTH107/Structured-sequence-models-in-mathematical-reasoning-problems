    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is a statistical method used to study the effect of multiple factors on a response variable. In this case, the manufacturer wants to test 4 different factors, each at 3 different levels. To determine the number of experimental conditions using an orthogonal array, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of experimental conditions = L^(k)\n\nwhere L is the number of levels for each factor, and k is the number of factors.\n\nIn this case, L = 3 (3 different levels for each factor) and k = 4 (4 different factors).\n\nNumber of experimental conditions = 3^4 = 81\n\nSo, the manufacturer can test 81 different experimental conditions using an orthogonal array."
