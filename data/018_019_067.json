    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B, which is denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3} = {1, 4, 5}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference between (A Δ B) and A, which is denoted as (A Δ B) Δ A.\n\n(A Δ B) Δ A = ({1, 4, 5} ∪ {1, 2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 4} = {2, 3, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference between B and A, which is denoted as B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3} = {1, 4, 5}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference between A and (B Δ A), which is denoted as A Δ (B Δ A).\n\nA Δ (B Δ A) = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {1, 4, 5}) - ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 4, 5}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 4} = {2, 3, 5}\n\nAs we can see, both (A Δ B) Δ A and A Δ (B Δ A) result in the same set {2, 3, 5}. This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative, as (A Δ B) Δ A = A Δ (B Δ A)."
