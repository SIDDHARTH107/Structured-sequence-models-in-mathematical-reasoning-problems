    "message_1": "A factory produces boxes of cereal that are supposed to weigh 12 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.5 ounces. However, the factory has recently noticed that the weights of the boxes have been varying more than expected. To investigate this, the factory plans to use a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 1,000 random samples of 100 boxes each and calculate the mean weight of each sample. \n\nWhat is the probability that the average weight of a random sample of 100 boxes will be less than 11.8 ounces?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the average weight of a random sample of 100 boxes will be less than 11.8 ounces, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 12 ounces, the population standard deviation (σ) is 0.5 ounces, and the sample size (n) is 100 boxes.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample means:\n\nσ_sample = σ / sqrt(n)\nσ_sample = 0.5 / sqrt(100)\nσ_sample = 0.5 / 10\nσ_sample = 0.05 ounces\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for 11.8 ounces:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample\nz = (11.8 - 12) / 0.05\nz = -0.2 / 0.05\nz = -4\n\nA z-score of -4 is quite far from the mean, indicating that it is very unlikely for the average weight of a random sample of 100 boxes to be less than 11.8 ounces. To find the probability, we can look up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator that provides the cumulative probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score less than -4 is approximately 0.00003 or 0.003%. So, there is a 0.003% chance that the average weight of a random sample of 100 boxes will be less than 11.8 ounces."
