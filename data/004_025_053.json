    "message_1": "A ball is thrown from the top of a building with an initial velocity of 20 m/s at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizontal. The building is 100 meters tall. What is the maximum height reached by the ball?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height reached by the ball, we need to first find the time it takes to reach the maximum height and then use that time to find the maximum height.\n\n1. Break down the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components:\nInitial vertical velocity (Voy) = 20 * sin(30°) = 20 * 0.5 = 10 m/s\nInitial horizontal velocity (Vox) = 20 * cos(30°) = 20 * (√3/2) ≈ 17.32 m/s\n\n2. Find the time it takes to reach the maximum height:\nAt the maximum height, the vertical velocity will be 0. We can use the following equation to find the time:\nVf = Vi + (a * t)\nwhere Vf is the final vertical velocity, Vi is the initial vertical velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity (which is -9.81 m/s²), and t is the time.\n\n0 = 10 + (-9.81 * t)\nt ≈ 1.02 seconds\n\n3. Find the maximum height:\nWe can use the following equation to find the maximum height:\nh = Vi * t + 0.5 * a * t²\nwhere h is the height, Vi is the initial vertical velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nh = 10 * 1.02 + 0.5 * (-9.81) * (1.02)²\nh ≈ 5.1 m\n\n4. Add the height of the building:\nThe maximum height reached by the ball is the sum of the height of the building and the height calculated above.\n\nMaximum height = 100 m (building height) + 5.1 m\nMaximum height ≈ 105.1 m"
