    "message_1": "A company has a revenue function of f(t) = 1000sin(2πt/365) dollars, where t is the time in days. Use Fourier analysis to find the frequency and amplitude of the revenue function.",
    "message_2": "The given function is already in the form of a sine function, so we don't need to perform a full Fourier analysis. We can directly identify the amplitude and frequency from the function.\n\nThe general form of a sine function is:\n\nf(t) = A * sin(2π * f * t + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, f is the frequency, and φ is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, the function is:\n\nf(t) = 1000 * sin(2π * t/365)\n\nComparing the two equations, we can see that:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 1000\nFrequency (f) = 1/365 cycles per day\n\nSo, the amplitude of the revenue function is 1000 dollars, and the frequency is 1/365 cycles per day."
