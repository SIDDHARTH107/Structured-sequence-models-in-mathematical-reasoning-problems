    "message_2": "To form a human tower with 4 people at the bottom and 4 people on top, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the acrobats such that no acrobat is on top of more than one other acrobat. This problem can be solved using Catalan numbers.\n\nLet's denote the number of ways to arrange the acrobats as C_n, where n is the number of pairs of acrobats (in this case, n = 4). The Catalan number formula is given by:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nFor n = 4, we have:\n\nC_4 = (1/(4+1)) * (2*4 choose 4)\nC_4 = (1/5) * (8 choose 4)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the binomial coefficient (8 choose 4):\n\n(8 choose 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\n(8 choose 4) = 8! / (4! * 4!)\n(8 choose 4) = 40320 / (24 * 24)\n(8 choose 4) = 70\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the Catalan number formula:\n\nC_4 = (1/5) * 70\nC_4 = 14\n\nSo, there are 14 ways to form a human tower with 4 people at the bottom and 4 people on top, assuming that no acrobat can be on top of more than one other acrobat."
