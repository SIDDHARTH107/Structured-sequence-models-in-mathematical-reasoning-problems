    "message_2": "To find the frequency content of the signal f(t) = 3cos(40πt) + 2sin(80πt), we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn this case, f(t) is a sum of two sinusoidal functions, so we can find the Fourier transform of each function separately and then add the results.\n\nFor the first term, 3cos(40πt):\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[3cos(40πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, cos(θ) = (e^(jθ) + e^(-jθ))/2, we can rewrite the cosine function as:\n\n3cos(40πt) = 3/2 * (e^(j40πt) + e^(-j40πt))\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of each exponential term:\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 * [∫(e^(j40πt) * e^(-jωt) dt) + ∫(e^(-j40πt) * e^(-jωt) dt)]\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 * [∫(e^(-j(ω-40π)t) dt) + ∫(e^(-j(ω+40π)t) dt)]\n\nUsing the property of the Fourier transform of an exponential function, we get:\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 * [2πδ(ω-40π) + 2πδ(ω+40π)]\n\nF1(ω) = 3π[δ(ω-40π) + δ(ω+40π)]\n\nFor the second term, 2sin(80πt):\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[2sin(80πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, sin(θ) = (e^(jθ) - e^(-jθ))/(2j), we can rewrite the sine function as:\n\n2sin(80πt) = (e^(j80πt) - e^(-j80πt))/j\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of each exponential term:\n\nF2(ω) = 1/j * [∫(e^(j80πt) * e^(-jωt) dt) - ∫(e^(-j80πt) * e^(-jωt) dt)]\n\nF2(ω) = 1/j * [∫(e^(-j(ω-80π)t) dt) - ∫(e^(-j(ω+80π)t) dt)]\n\nUsing the property of the Fourier transform of an exponential function, we get:\n\nF2(ω) = 1/j * [2πδ(ω-80π) - 2πδ(ω+80π)]\n\nF2(ω) = (2π/j)[δ(ω-80π) - δ(ω+80π)]\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier transforms of the two terms:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω)\n\nF(ω) = 3π[δ(ω-40π) + δ(ω+40π)] + (2π/j)[δ(ω-80π) - δ(ω+80π)]\n\nThis is the frequency content of the signal f(t) = 3cos(40πt) + 2sin(80πt). The signal has frequency components at 20 Hz and 40 Hz, with amplitudes 3 and 2, respectively."
