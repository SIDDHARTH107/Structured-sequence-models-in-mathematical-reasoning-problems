    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral area (curved surface) and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 4 cm.\n\nA_base = π(4 cm)² = 16π cm²\n\nTo find the lateral area, we first need to find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to do this: l² = r² + h², where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nl² = (4 cm)² + (6 cm)² = 16 cm² + 36 cm² = 52 cm²\nl = √52 cm ≈ 7.21 cm\n\nNow we can use the formula for the lateral area of a cone: A_lateral = πrl, where r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nA_lateral = π(4 cm)(7.21 cm) ≈ 28.84π cm²\n\nFinally, we add the base area and the lateral area to find the total surface area:\n\nSurface area = A_base + A_lateral = 16π cm² + 28.84π cm² ≈ 44.84π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is approximately 44.84π cm² or about 140.9 cm²."
