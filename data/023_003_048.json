    "message_1": "Consider the heat equation:\n\n∂u / ∂t = k (∂²u/∂x²), \n\nwhere t is the time, x is the position on a rod of length L, and k is a constant. The rod has temperature distribution u(x,0) = f(x) at time t=0. Use Fourier series to solve this equation, subject to boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0.\n\nSuppose that L=4 units and the initial temperature distribution on the rod is given by:\n\nf(x) = 1 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, \n\nf(x) = 0 for 1 < x ≤ 4,\n\nand k=1. Find the solution to the heat equation at time t=2.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using Fourier series, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients for the given initial temperature distribution f(x). Since f(x) is a piecewise function, we'll need to split the integral into two parts. The Fourier sine series representation of f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)] dx, integrated over the interval [0, L].\n\nNow, let's find the B_n coefficients:\n\nB_n = (2/4) * [∫[sin(nπx/4)] dx from 0 to 1 + ∫[0 * sin(nπx/4)] dx from 1 to 4]\nB_n = (1/2) * [∫[sin(nπx/4)] dx from 0 to 1]\n\nIntegrating and evaluating the integral, we get:\n\nB_n = (1/2) * [(4/(nπ)) * (cos(nπ) - 1)]\n\nNow, we can write the solution to the heat equation as:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [(4/(nπ)) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nπx/4) * e^(-(nπ/4)^2 * t)]\n\nWe are asked to find the solution at time t=2, so we plug in t=2:\n\nu(x,2) = Σ [(4/(nπ)) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nπx/4) * e^(-(nπ/4)^2 * 2)]\n\nThis is the solution to the heat equation at time t=2 for the given initial temperature distribution and boundary conditions. To find the temperature distribution at specific points along the rod, we can plug in the x values and sum the series. Note that the series converges quickly, so only a few terms are needed for a good approximation."
