    "message_1": "A system's input signal is given by x(t) = 3cos(10πt) + 2sin(20πt) and the output signal by y(t) = 4cos(10πt + π/4) + 2sin(20πt - π/6). Using Fourier analysis, what is the gain and phase shift of the system for the frequency components 10π and 20π?",
    "message_2": "To find the gain and phase shift of the system for the frequency components 10π and 20π, we need to compare the input and output signals for each frequency component.\n\nFor the 10π frequency component:\nInput signal: 3cos(10πt)\nOutput signal: 4cos(10πt + π/4)\n\nThe gain is the ratio of the output amplitude to the input amplitude. In this case, the gain is 4/3.\n\nThe phase shift is the difference in the phase angle between the output and input signals. In this case, the phase shift is π/4.\n\nFor the 20π frequency component:\nInput signal: 2sin(20πt)\nOutput signal: 2sin(20πt - π/6)\n\nThe gain is the ratio of the output amplitude to the input amplitude. In this case, the gain is 2/2 = 1.\n\nThe phase shift is the difference in the phase angle between the output and input signals. In this case, the phase shift is -π/6.\n\nSo, for the 10π frequency component, the gain is 4/3 and the phase shift is π/4. For the 20π frequency component, the gain is 1 and the phase shift is -π/6."
