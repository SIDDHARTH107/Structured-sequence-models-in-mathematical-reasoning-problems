    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. \n\nIn this graph, we can see that vertex D has the highest degree, which is 4. According to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index of a graph is either equal to the maximum degree (Δ) or Δ + 1.\n\nLet's try to color the edges using 4 colors:\n\n1. Color the edge AD with color 1.\n2. Color the edge AC with color 2.\n3. Color the edge AB with color 3.\n4. Color the edge BC with color 4.\n5. Color the edge BD with color 2.\n6. Color the edge BE with color 3.\n7. Color the edge CD with color 4.\n8. Color the edge DE with color 1.\n\nWe have successfully colored all the edges using 4 colors without any adjacent edges sharing the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of this graph is 4."
