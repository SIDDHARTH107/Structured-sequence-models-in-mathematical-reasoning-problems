    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Cauchy integral formula. First, let's rewrite the given function as a product of two functions:\n\ng(z) = f(z)(z-i) = (z/(z^2 + 4))(z-i)\n\nNow, let's find the singularities of the function f(z) = z/(z^2 + 4). We can do this by finding the roots of the denominator:\n\nz^2 + 4 = 0\nz^2 = -4\nz = ±2i\n\nSo, the singularities are at z = 2i and z = -2i. Since C is a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin, only the singularity z = 2i is inside the contour C.\n\nNow, we will use the Cauchy integral formula to find the integral of g(z) along C:\n\n∫[C] g(z) dz = 2πi * Res(g(z), 2i)\n\nTo find the residue of g(z) at z = 2i, we can use the formula for the residue of a simple pole:\n\nRes(g(z), 2i) = lim (z→2i) [(z - 2i)g(z)]\n\nNow, let's substitute g(z) and compute the limit:\n\nRes(g(z), 2i) = lim (z→2i) [(z - 2i)(z/(z^2 + 4))(z-i)]\n= lim (z→2i) [(z^2 - 2iz)/(z^2 + 4)]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limit as z approaches 2i:\n\nRes(g(z), 2i) = [(2i)^2 - 2(2i)(2i)]/((2i)^2 + 4)\n= (-4 - 8i)/(4 - 4)\n= -8i/0\n\nSince the denominator is zero, this limit does not exist. Therefore, the residue of g(z) at z = 2i is 0.\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy integral formula to find the integral of g(z) along C:\n\n∫[C] g(z) dz = 2πi * Res(g(z), 2i) = 2πi * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the value of the integral along C of f(z)(z-i) is 0."
