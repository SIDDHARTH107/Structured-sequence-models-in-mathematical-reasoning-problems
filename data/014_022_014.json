    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted a Playfair cipher encrypted message - \"XYUNMJMNHRKY\" and you know that the keyword used to generate the encryption table was \"MATHS\", can you decrypt the message and write it in plain text format?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher encrypted message, we first need to generate the 5x5 encryption table using the keyword \"MATHS\". The table is created by filling in the letters of the keyword (omitting duplicates) from left to right and top to bottom, and then filling the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding \"J\", which is combined with \"I\").\n\nThe table generated using the keyword \"MATHS\" is:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message \"XYUNMJMNHRKY\" using the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same (or only one letter is left), add an \"X\" after the first letter. (Not applicable in this case)\n2. If the letters appear on the same row of the table, replace them each with the letter to their immediate left (wrapping around to the right side of the row if necessary).\n3. If the letters appear on the same column of the table, replace them each with the letter above them (wrapping around to the bottom of the column if necessary).\n4. If the letters are not on the same row or column, replace them with the letters on the same row but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair.\n\nDecrypting the message using these rules:\n\nXY -> PL\nUN -> AY\nMJ -> F\nMN -> I\nHR -> R\nKY -> S\n\nThe decrypted message is \"PLAYFAIRS\"."
