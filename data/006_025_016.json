    "message_1": "In a circus performance, there are 12 clowns and 8 acrobats. What is the probability of selecting 3 acrobats at random from the performers if a group of 6 performers is to be chosen for a special performance?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of the items does not matter.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 6 performers from the group of 12 clowns and 8 acrobats. This can be represented as a combination: C(20, 6), where 20 is the total number of performers (12 clowns + 8 acrobats) and 6 is the number of performers we want to choose.\n\nC(20, 6) = 20! / (6! * (20 - 6)!)\nC(20, 6) = 20! / (6! * 14!)\nC(20, 6) = 38,760 (total ways to choose 6 performers)\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to choose 3 acrobats from the 8 acrobats. This can be represented as a combination: C(8, 3).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8 - 3)!)\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * 5!)\nC(8, 3) = 56 (ways to choose 3 acrobats)\n\nSince we want to choose 3 acrobats, we also need to choose 3 other performers from the remaining 12 clowns. This can be represented as a combination: C(12, 3).\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12 - 3)!)\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * 9!)\nC(12, 3) = 220 (ways to choose 3 clowns)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 acrobats and 3 clowns together. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of ways to choose 3 acrobats and the number of ways to choose 3 clowns:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 acrobats and 3 clowns = 56 * 220 = 12,320\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of selecting 3 acrobats at random from the performers if a group of 6 performers is to be chosen for a special performance:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 3 acrobats and 3 clowns) / (Total ways to choose 6 performers)\nProbability = 12,320 / 38,760\nProbability â‰ˆ 0.3178\n\nSo, the probability of selecting 3 acrobats at random from the performers if a group of 6 performers is to be chosen for a special performance is approximately 0.3178 or 31.78%."
