    "message_2": "To determine if G has an Eulerian circuit or path, we need to check the degrees of its vertices. An Eulerian circuit exists if all vertices have even degrees, while an Eulerian path exists if exactly two vertices have odd degrees.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot determine the degrees of the vertices and thus cannot determine if G has an Eulerian circuit or path.\n\nAs for Hamiltonian circuits and paths, there is no general method to determine their existence in a graph. The problem of finding a Hamiltonian circuit or path is an NP-complete problem, meaning that there is no known efficient algorithm to solve it for all graphs.\n\nWithout knowing the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot determine if G has a Hamiltonian circuit or path.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the graph G, we cannot determine if it has an Eulerian circuit or path, nor can we determine if it has a Hamiltonian circuit or path."
