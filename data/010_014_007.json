    "message_2": "Let's first understand the problem and the given information.\n\nX is a topological space represented as a circle with diameter 1. This means that X is homeomorphic to the circle S^1. The function f: X → S^1 is continuous and takes opposite points on X to opposite points on S^1. Since X is homeomorphic to S^1, we can consider f as a map from S^1 to itself.\n\nNow, we want to find the value of the first cohomology group of X with coefficients in the group of integer multiples of pi under the induced map by f. The first cohomology group is denoted by H^1(X; G), where G is the coefficient group. In this case, G is the group of integer multiples of pi, which we can denote by Zπ.\n\nSince X is homeomorphic to S^1, we can use the known cohomology groups of S^1. The first cohomology group of S^1 with integer coefficients is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., H^1(S^1; Z) ≅ Z. To find the first cohomology group with coefficients in Zπ, we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem.\n\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem states that there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Hom(H^1(X; Z), G) → H^1(X; G) → Ext(H_0(X; Z), G) → 0\n\nIn our case, X is S^1 and G is Zπ. Since H^1(S^1; Z) ≅ Z, we have:\n\n0 → Hom(Z, Zπ) → H^1(S^1; Zπ) → Ext(Z, Zπ) → 0\n\nHom(Z, Zπ) is the group of homomorphisms from Z to Zπ, which is isomorphic to Zπ itself. The Ext group Ext(Z, Zπ) is trivial since Zπ is a divisible group. Therefore, the short exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → Zπ → H^1(S^1; Zπ) → 0\n\nThis implies that H^1(S^1; Zπ) ≅ Zπ.\n\nNow, we need to consider the induced map by f. Since f is a map from S^1 to itself taking opposite points to opposite points, it can be considered as a reflection. The induced map on the cohomology groups is multiplication by the degree of the map. In this case, the degree of the reflection map is -1.\n\nSo, the induced map on H^1(S^1; Zπ) is multiplication by -1. However, since H^1(S^1; Zπ) ≅ Zπ, multiplication by -1 does not change the group structure. Therefore, the value of the first cohomology group of X with coefficients in the group of integer multiples of pi under the induced map by f is still isomorphic to Zπ."
