Write an expression in lambda calculus that represents the function `f` using the `λ` notation.\n\nOnce you have written the lambda calculus expression for `f`, evaluate the following expression using your definition of `f`:\n\n`(f (λx.x + 1))`",
    "message_2": "To represent the function `f` in lambda calculus, we can use the following notation:\n\n`f = λg. E`\n\nHere, `g` is a function of type `Int -> Int`, and `E` is an expression that represents the output of `f` given the input function `g`. Since the problem does not specify the behavior of `f`, we cannot determine the exact expression `E`. However, we can still use this general representation to evaluate the given expression.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the expression `(f (λx.x + 1))` using the definition of `f`:\n\n`(f (λx.x + 1)) = (λg. E) (λx.x + 1)`\n\nBy applying the function `λg. E` to the input `(λx.x + 1)`, we substitute `g` with `(λx.x + 1)` in the expression `E`:\n\n`E[g := (λx.x + 1)]`\n\nSince we don't know the exact expression `E`, we cannot evaluate this expression further. However, this is the result of the evaluation using the given information."
