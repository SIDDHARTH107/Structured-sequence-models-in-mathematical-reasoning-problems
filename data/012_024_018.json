    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have V = 12 and E = 18. We can rewrite Euler's formula as:\n\nF = 2 - V + E = 2 - 12 + 18 = 8\n\nNow, let's consider the inequality for non-planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n18 ≤ 3 * 12 - 6\n18 ≤ 30\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph G could be planar. However, we need to check if it's possible to draw the graph without any edge crossings.\n\nIf the graph is planar, then its genus is 0. If it's not planar, we need to find the minimum number of handles we need to add to a sphere to embed the graph without edge crossings. This number is the genus of the graph.\n\nTo find the genus, we can use the formula:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nwhere g is the genus of the graph. We can rearrange the formula to solve for g:\n\ng ≥ (E - 3V + 6) / 6\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\ng ≥ (18 - 3 * 12 + 6) / 6\ng ≥ (-18) / 6\ng ≥ -3\n\nSince the genus cannot be negative, the minimum value for g is 0. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 0, which means it is planar."
