    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations on the augmented matrix to transform it into an upper triangular matrix (also called row-echelon form). Then, we will use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2  3  4 | 20 ]\n[ 3  5  6 | 33 ]\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we will subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 3 * Row1\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  2 |  8 ]\n[ 0  2  3 | 15 ]\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we will subtract 2 times the second row from the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 - 2 * Row2\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  2 |  8 ]\n[ 0  0 -1 | -1 ]\n\nNow the matrix is in upper triangular form (row-echelon form).\n\nStep 3: Use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n-1z = -1\nz = 1\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\ny + 2z = 8\ny + 2(1) = 8\ny = 6\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\nx + y + z = 6\nx + 6 + 1 = 6\nx = -1\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1, y = 6, and z = 1."
