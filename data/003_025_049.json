    "message_2": "To find the resulting velocity of the boat, we need to break down the boat's velocity into its horizontal and vertical components and then add the river's velocity to the horizontal component.\n\nThe horizontal component of the boat's velocity (Vx) can be found using the cosine function:\nVx = 15 * cos(40°)\nVx ≈ 11.49 m/s\n\nThe vertical component of the boat's velocity (Vy) can be found using the sine function:\nVy = 15 * sin(40°)\nVy ≈ 9.64 m/s\n\nNow, we add the river's velocity to the horizontal component of the boat's velocity:\nVx_total = Vx + river's velocity\nVx_total = 11.49 + 10\nVx_total = 21.49 m/s\n\nNow that we have the total horizontal and vertical components of the resulting velocity, we can find the magnitude and direction of the resulting velocity.\n\nMagnitude (V_result) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\nV_result = sqrt(Vx_total^2 + Vy^2)\nV_result = sqrt((21.49)^2 + (9.64)^2)\nV_result ≈ 23.34 m/s\n\nTo find the direction (θ) of the resulting velocity, we can use the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(Vy / Vx_total)\nθ = arctan(9.64 / 21.49)\nθ ≈ 24.18°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resulting velocity of the boat is approximately 23.34 m/s, and the direction is approximately 24.18° with respect to the river flow."
