    "message_1": "A factory produces 5000 widgets per day. The probability of a defective widget being produced is 0.03. What is the probability that there will be less than 130 defective widgets produced in a day in this factory?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution since the number of trials (widgets produced) is large and the probability of success (defective widget) is small.\n\nThe Poisson distribution has a parameter λ (lambda) which is the average number of successes (defective widgets) in a given interval (a day). In this case, λ = n * p, where n is the number of widgets produced (5000) and p is the probability of a defective widget (0.03).\n\nλ = 5000 * 0.03 = 150\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that there will be less than 130 defective widgets produced in a day, i.e., P(X < 130). Using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X < 130) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 129)\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere k is the number of defective widgets, e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nWe can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 129 and sum them up to find the probability of less than 130 defective widgets produced in a day.\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 130) ≈ 0.0103\n\nSo, the probability that there will be less than 130 defective widgets produced in a day in this factory is approximately 1.03%."
