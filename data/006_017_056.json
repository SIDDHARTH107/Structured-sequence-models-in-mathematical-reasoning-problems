    "message_1": "A certain type of traffic accident occurs on a particular road at a rate of 0.02 collisions per hour. What is the probability that in a 10-hour period, there will be at least one such collision on that road?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, traffic accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time (10 hours) given a known average rate (0.02 collisions per hour).\n\nThe probability of k events occurring in a given time period is given by the formula:\n\nP(k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere λ is the average rate of events (collisions per hour) and k is the number of events we want to find the probability for.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least one collision occurring in a 10-hour period. To do this, it's easier to find the probability of no collisions occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, we'll find the probability of k=0 collisions occurring in a 10-hour period:\n\nλ = 0.02 collisions per hour * 10 hours = 0.2 collisions\nk = 0\n\nP(0) = (0.2^0 * e^(-0.2)) / 0! = (1 * e^(-0.2)) / 1 = e^(-0.2)\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of at least one collision:\n\nP(at least 1) = 1 - P(0) = 1 - e^(-0.2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(at least 1) ≈ 1 - 0.8187 ≈ 0.1813\n\nSo, the probability of at least one collision occurring in a 10-hour period on that road is approximately 18.13%."
