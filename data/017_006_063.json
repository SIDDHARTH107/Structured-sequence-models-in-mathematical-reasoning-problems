    "message_2": "To determine whether a group of order 35 is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we can use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: A group of order pq, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q.\n\nProof: Let G be a group of order pq, where p and q are distinct prime numbers. By Cauchy's theorem, G has elements of order p and q, say x and y, respectively. Since the orders of x and y are coprime, the order of the element xy is the product of the orders of x and y, i.e., |xy| = pq. Therefore, G has an element of order pq, which means G is a cyclic group generated by the element xy.\n\nNow, let's apply this theorem to our problem. We have a group of order 35, which is the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. By the theorem, this group is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nTo determine which case holds, we can use the following corollary of the theorem:\n\nCorollary: A group of order pq, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q if and only if there exists an element of order p and an element of order q that commute.\n\nProof: If G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q, then G is isomorphic to the group C_p Ã— C_q, where C_p and C_q are cyclic groups of orders p and q, respectively. In this case, G has elements x and y of orders p and q, respectively, that commute, since the elements of C_p and C_q commute.\n\nConversely, if G has elements x and y of orders p and q, respectively, that commute, then the subgroup generated by x and the subgroup generated by y are both normal in G, and their intersection is trivial. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of the subgroups generated by x and y, which are cyclic groups of orders p and q, respectively.\n\nNow, let's apply this corollary to our problem. We have a group G of order 35, which is the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. By the theorem, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nSince G has elements of order 5 and 7, say x and y, respectively, we only need to check whether x and y commute. If they do, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7; otherwise, G is cyclic.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information about the specific group G to determine whether x and y commute. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether G is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
