    "message_1": "A ladder is leaned against a wall with an inclination of 60 degrees. If the bottom of the ladder is 6 meters from the wall, how long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the adjacent side (the side touching the angle) divided by the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle).\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees, and the adjacent side is the distance from the wall to the bottom of the ladder, which is 6 meters. We want to find the length of the ladder, which is the hypotenuse.\n\ncos(60) = adjacent / hypotenuse\ncos(60) = 6 / hypotenuse\n\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 6 / hypotenuse\n\nNow, we can solve for the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder):\n\nhypotenuse = 6 / 0.5\nhypotenuse = 12\n\nThe length of the ladder is 12 meters."
