    "message_2": "1. Determine the singular points of the curve.\n\nTo find the singular points of the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 2. Then, the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 6x - 4\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n-3x^2 + 6x - 4 = 0\n2y = 0\n\nThe second equation gives y = 0. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n-3x^2 + 6x - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for x:\n\nx = (6 ± √(6^2 - 4(-3)(-4))) / (2(-3))\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 48)) / (-6)\nx = (6 ± √(-12)) / (-6)\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for x. Therefore, there are no singular points on the curve.\n\n2. Calculate the genus of the curve using Mori theory.\n\nMori theory is not applicable in this case, as it is a higher-dimensional algebraic geometry theory used for studying the birational classification of algebraic varieties. Instead, we can use the arithmetic genus formula for a plane curve of degree d:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2) / 2\n\nIn our case, the degree of the curve is 3 (since the highest degree term is x^3). Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\ng = (3 - 1)(3 - 2) / 2\ng = (2)(1) / 2\ng = 1\n\nSo, the genus of the curve is 1."
