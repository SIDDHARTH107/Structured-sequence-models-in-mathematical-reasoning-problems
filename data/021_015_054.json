    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Here, we will use PSO to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5 over the interval [0, 10].\n\n1. Initialize the swarm: Select a random initial position (x) and velocity (v) for each particle in the swarm. The position represents a potential solution, and the velocity determines how the particle will move in the search space.\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle: Calculate the value of f(x) for each particle's position.\n\n3. Update personal best and global best: If the current position of a particle is better than its previous best position, update its personal best (pBest). If the current position of a particle is better than the best position found by the entire swarm, update the global best (gBest).\n\n4. Update the velocity and position of each particle: Update the velocity of each particle using the following formula:\n\nv_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * r1 * (pBest_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * r2 * (gBest - x_i(t))\n\nwhere w is the inertia weight, c1 and c2 are acceleration constants, r1 and r2 are random numbers between 0 and 1, and t represents the current iteration.\n\nUpdate the position of each particle using the following formula:\n\nx_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations or minimum error threshold).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, the global best position (gBest) will represent the minimum value of the function f(x) over the interval [0, 10]. Note that the PSO algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution may not be the exact minimum value but an approximation."
