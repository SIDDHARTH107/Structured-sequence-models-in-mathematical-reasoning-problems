    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, every subset of A is considered an open set. This is because the discrete topology is defined as the collection of all possible subsets of A, which forms the open sets.\n\nSince B = {2, 3} and C = {3, 4} are both subsets of A, they are both open sets in the discrete topology on A."
