Here is a question the student can solve: \n\nSuppose the annual growth rate of a stock is given by the function f(t) = 5cos(2πt) + 3sin(4πt), where time t is measured in years. Use the Fourier transform to compute the value of the stock after 5 years assuming an initial investment of $100.\n\nHint: The formula for the Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by F(ω) = ∫ f(t)e^-iωt dt, where ω is the frequency of the function.",
    "message_2": "The problem statement seems to be a bit confusing, as the Fourier transform is not the most appropriate tool to compute the value of a stock after a certain period of time. Instead, we can use integration to find the accumulated growth over the 5-year period and then apply it to the initial investment.\n\nGiven the annual growth rate function f(t) = 5cos(2πt) + 3sin(4πt), we want to find the accumulated growth over 5 years. To do this, we integrate f(t) with respect to t from 0 to 5:\n\n∫[5cos(2πt) + 3sin(4πt)] dt from 0 to 5\n\nLet's integrate each term separately:\n\n∫5cos(2πt) dt = (5/(2π))sin(2πt) + C1\n∫3sin(4πt) dt = -(3/(4π))cos(4πt) + C2\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivatives at the limits of integration:\n\n[(5/(2π))sin(2π(5)) - (5/(2π))sin(2π(0))] + [-(3/(4π))cos(4π(5)) + (3/(4π))cos(4π(0))]\n\nSince sin(2πn) = 0 and cos(2πn) = 1 for any integer n, the expression simplifies to:\n\n(5/(2π))(0) - (3/(4π))(1 - 1) = 0\n\nThe accumulated growth over 5 years is 0, which means there is no change in the value of the stock. Therefore, the value of the stock after 5 years is still $100."
