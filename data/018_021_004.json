    "message_2": "To prove that (A △ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) △ (B ∩ C), we will first find the symmetric difference of A and B, then the intersection of the result with C. After that, we will find the intersection of A and C and the intersection of B and C, and then find the symmetric difference of these two results. If both results are the same, then the given statement is true.\n\nFirst, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A △ B). The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {3, 5, 2, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A △ B) and C, which is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\n(A △ B) ∩ C = {2, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and C, and the intersection of B and C.\n\nA ∩ C = { }\nB ∩ C = {2, 4}\n\nSince A ∩ C is an empty set, the symmetric difference of (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C) is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both.\n\n(A ∩ C) △ (B ∩ C) = {2, 4}\n\nNow, comparing the results:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ C = {2, 4}\n(A ∩ C) △ (B ∩ C) = {2, 4}\n\nSince both results are the same, we have proven that (A △ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) △ (B ∩ C)."
