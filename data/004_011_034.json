    "message_1": "A ladder with a length of 10 meters is leaning against a wall. The base of the ladder is initially 6 meters away from the wall but it is gradually being pushed towards the wall at a rate of 0.2 meters per second. How fast is the top of the ladder moving down the wall when the base is 4 meters away from the wall? (Round to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance of the base of the ladder from the wall, and y be the distance of the top of the ladder from the ground. We are given that the ladder has a length of 10 meters, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\nWe are also given that the base of the ladder is being pushed towards the wall at a rate of 0.2 meters per second, so dx/dt = -0.2 m/s (negative because the distance is decreasing). We want to find dy/dt when x = 4 meters.\n\nTo find dy/dt, we can differentiate the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(4)(-0.2) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWhen x = 4, we can find y using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n4^2 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 100 - 16 = 84\ny = √84 ≈ 9.17\n\nNow we can plug in the value of y and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(4)(-0.2) + 2(9.17)(dy/dt) = 0\n-1.6 + 18.34(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dt:\n\n18.34(dy/dt) = 1.6\ndy/dt = 1.6 / 18.34 ≈ 0.0872 m/s\n\nThe top of the ladder is moving down the wall at a rate of approximately 0.09 meters per second when the base is 4 meters away from the wall."
