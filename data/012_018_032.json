    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In order to achieve this, we can try to remove edges from the graph such that it becomes a forest (a collection of disconnected trees).\n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In our case, we have 9 vertices, so a tree would have 8 edges. If we can transform the given graph into a tree, then it will be disconnected if we remove just one more edge.\n\nSince the given graph has 12 edges, we need to remove at least 4 edges to make it a tree (12 - 8 = 4). After that, we can remove one more edge to disconnect the graph. Therefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 5."
