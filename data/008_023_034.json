    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products, A and B. They make a profit of $8 on each type A product and $12 on each type B product. The manufacturer can produce a maximum of 200 units of type A and 300 units of type B product. The production process also incurs some cost, which is equal to $6 for each type A product and $10 for each type B product. If the manufacturer wants to maximize their profit, how many units of each type of product should they produce? Solve the system of equations to find the optimal solution with 10% noise in the data measurements.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the net profit for each type of product:\n\nNet profit for type A product = Selling price - Cost = $8 - $6 = $2\nNet profit for type B product = Selling price - Cost = $12 - $10 = $2\n\nNow, let's consider the 10% noise in the data measurements. We will calculate the range of possible net profits for each product:\n\nFor type A product:\nLower bound = $2 - 10% of $2 = $2 - $0.2 = $1.8\nUpper bound = $2 + 10% of $2 = $2 + $0.2 = $2.2\n\nFor type B product:\nLower bound = $2 - 10% of $2 = $2 - $0.2 = $1.8\nUpper bound = $2 + 10% of $2 = $2 + $0.2 = $2.2\n\nLet x be the number of type A products and y be the number of type B products. The constraints are:\n\n1) x <= 200\n2) y <= 300\n\nSince the net profit for both products is the same, we can maximize the profit by producing as many units as possible within the constraints. \n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can test the upper and lower bounds of the net profits:\n\nCase 1: Lower bound net profit for both products ($1.8)\nTotal profit = $1.8x + $1.8y\n\nCase 2: Upper bound net profit for both products ($2.2)\nTotal profit = $2.2x + $2.2y\n\nIn both cases, the total profit is maximized when the manufacturer produces the maximum number of units for both products (x = 200 and y = 300).\n\nSo, the manufacturer should produce 200 units of type A product and 300 units of type B product to maximize their profit."
