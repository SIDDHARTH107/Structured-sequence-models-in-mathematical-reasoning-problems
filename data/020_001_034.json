The processing time (in minutes) required for each product in the two departments is given in the table below:\n\n| Processing Time (in minutes) | Department 1 | Department 2 |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Product A                    | 5            | 7            |\n| Product B                    | 6            | 4            |\n\nThe company has 80 minutes of processing time available in department 1 and 70 minutes available in department 2. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and profit per unit of product B is $8. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the processing time in each department can be written as:\n\n5x + 6y ≤ 80 (Department 1)\n7x + 4y ≤ 70 (Department 2)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 8y\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n5x + 6y = 80\ny = (80 - 5x) / 6\n\n7x + 4y = 70\ny = (70 - 7x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of the constraint lines and the axes. We will find these intersection points:\n\n1. Intersection with the x-axis (y = 0):\n5x + 6(0) = 80\nx = 16\n\n2. Intersection with the y-axis (x = 0):\n7(0) + 4y = 70\ny = 17.5\n\n3. Intersection of the two constraint lines:\n5x + 6y = 80\n7x + 4y = 70\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\ny = (80 - 5x) / 6\ny = (80 - 5(5)) / 6\ny = 10\n\nSo the intersection point is (5, 10).\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function at each of the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 8(0) = 0\n2. P(16, 0) = 10(16) + 8(0) = 160\n3. P(0, 17.5) = 10(0) + 8(17.5) = 140\n4. P(5, 10) = 10(5) + 8(10) = 50 + 80 = 130\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (16, 0), with a profit of $160. Therefore, the company should produce 16 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize their total profit."
