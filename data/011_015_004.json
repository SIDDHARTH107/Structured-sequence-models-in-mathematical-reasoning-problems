    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. We will consider each person as a \"pigeonhole\" and the friendships as \"pigeons.\"\n\nIn a group of 6 people, each person can have at most 5 friends. To ensure that there is no group of 3 people who all know each other, we can distribute the friendships in such a way that each person has at most 2 friends. This can be done by forming a cycle of friendships, where each person is friends with exactly 2 other people in the group.\n\nHowever, if we add one more friendship to this configuration, we will create a group of 3 people where either all of them know each other or none of them know each other. This is because, when adding a new friendship, it will either create a triangle of friendships (all 3 know each other) or connect two people who were not previously connected in the cycle, creating a group of 3 where none of them know each other.\n\nSo, the minimum number of friendships that must exist in order for there to be either a group of 3 people who all know each other or a group of 3 people where none of them know each other is 1 more than the number of friendships in the cycle configuration, which is 6 + 1 = 7 friendships."
