    "message_1": "An auction is being held for a rare book. There are three bidders: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Alice's valuation of the book is $800. Bob's valuation is $600, and Carol's valuation is $500. The auction is a sealed-bid, second-price auction. If Alice bids $750, Bob bids $700, and Carol bids $600, who wins the auction and what is their cost for the book?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid, second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price. In this case, Alice has the highest bid at $750, so she wins the auction. The second-highest bid is Bob's at $700, so Alice will pay $700 for the book."
