    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two different types of products, A and B. The raw materials required to manufacture one unit of A and B are 2 and 3 units respectively. The company has 200 units of raw materials available. The company wants to maximize its profit by selling the products in the market. The profit from a unit of A and B is $10 and $15 respectively. How many units of A and B should the company produce to maximize its profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraint on the raw materials can be represented by the following equation:\n2x + 3y ≤ 200\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region. Then, we will find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint equation for y:\ny ≤ (200 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region. The feasible region is bounded by the following points:\n1. x = 0, y = 0 (origin)\n2. x = 0, y = (200 - 2*0) / 3 = 200 / 3 ≈ 66.67\n3. x = 100, y = 0 (when all raw materials are used for product A)\n4. Intersection point of the constraint equation and the x-axis (when all raw materials are used for product B)\n\nTo find the intersection point, we'll set x = 0 in the constraint equation:\n2x + 3y = 200\n2(0) + 3y = 200\ny = 200 / 3 ≈ 66.67\n\nSo, the intersection point is (0, 66.67).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 66.67) = 10(0) + 15(66.67) = $1,000.05\n3. P(100, 0) = 10(100) + 15(0) = $1,000\n4. P(0, 66.67) = 10(0) + 15(66.67) = $1,000.05\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 66.67), with a profit of $1,000.05. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a product, they should produce 66 units of product B and no units of product A to maximize their profit at $990 (66 * $15)."
