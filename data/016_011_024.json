    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-similar fractal, and its Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, at each iteration, the square is divided into 3x3 smaller squares, and 5 of them are kept (the center one and the four corner ones). So, N = 5 and s = 3.\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal does not depend on the number of iterations. So, even with an iteration of 4, the Hausdorff dimension remains approximately 1.46497."
