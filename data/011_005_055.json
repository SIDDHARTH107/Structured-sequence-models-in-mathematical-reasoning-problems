    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people, k is the number of people to be selected, and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and k = 3.\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\n\nC(6, 3) = (720) / (6*6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 ways to select a committee of 3 people from a group of 6 people, where the order of selection does not matter."
