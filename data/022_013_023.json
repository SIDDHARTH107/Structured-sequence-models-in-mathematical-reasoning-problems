    "message_2": "We will use the Cauchy's integral formula for the derivative of an analytic function. The formula states that for an analytic function f(z) inside and on a simple closed contour C,\n\nf'(a) = (1/(2πi)) ∮(C) (f(z)/(z-a)^2) dz\n\nwhere a is a point inside the contour C. In our case, we have a = 0 and the contour C is the circle |z| = 1.\n\nNow, we want to find an upper bound for |f'(0)|. We have:\n\n|f'(0)| = |(1/(2πi)) ∮(C) (f(z)/z^2) dz|\n\nUsing the inequality |f(z)| ≤ 3|z|, we get:\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (1/(2π)) ∮(C) (|f(z)|/|z^2|) |dz|\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (1/(2π)) ∮(C) (3|z|/|z^2|) |dz|\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (3/(2π)) ∮(C) (1/|z|) |dz|\n\nNow, let's parametrize the contour C by z(t) = e^(it) where t ∈ [0, 2π]. Then, dz/dt = ie^(it), and |dz/dt| = |i||e^(it)| = 1. So,\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (3/(2π)) ∫(0 to 2π) (1/|e^(it)|) dt\n\nSince |e^(it)| = 1 for all t, we have:\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (3/(2π)) ∫(0 to 2π) dt\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (3/(2π)) (2π)\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ 3\n\nThus, the upper bound for |f'(0)| is 3."
