    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position vector r(t) with respect to t.\n\nr(t) = <2sin(t), 2cos(t), 3t>\n\nFirst derivative:\nr'(t) = <2cos(t), -2sin(t), 3>\n\nSecond derivative:\nr''(t) = <-2sin(t), -2cos(t), 0>\n\nNow, we need to find the unit tangent vector T(t) and its derivative with respect to t.\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nTo find the magnitude of r'(t), we have:\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt((2cos(t))^2 + (-2sin(t))^2 + 3^2)\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(4cos^2(t) + 4sin^2(t) + 9)\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13)\n\nSo, T(t) = <2cos(t)/sqrt(13), -2sin(t)/sqrt(13), 3/sqrt(13)>\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of T(t) with respect to t:\n\nT'(t) = <-2sin(t)/sqrt(13), -2cos(t)/sqrt(13), 0>\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) at t = pi/4:\n\nk = ||T'(t)|| at t = pi/4\nk = sqrt((-2sin(pi/4)/sqrt(13))^2 + (-2cos(pi/4)/sqrt(13))^2)\nk = sqrt((2/sqrt(13))^2 + (2/sqrt(13))^2)\nk = 2sqrt(2)/sqrt(13)\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ). We need to find the unit normal vector N(t) and the unit binormal vector B(t).\n\nN(t) = T'(t) / ||T'(t)||\n\nAt t = pi/4, N(t) = <-2sin(pi/4)/sqrt(13), -2cos(pi/4)/sqrt(13), 0> / (2sqrt(2)/sqrt(13))\nN(t) = <-1, -1, 0>\n\nNow, we can find the binormal vector B(t) using the cross product of T(t) and N(t):\n\nB(t) = T(t) x N(t)\nB(t) = <2cos(t)/sqrt(13), -2sin(t)/sqrt(13), 3/sqrt(13)> x <-1, -1, 0>\nB(t) = <(6/sqrt(13))sin(t), (6/sqrt(13))cos(t), -2>\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of B(t) with respect to t:\n\nB'(t) = <(6/sqrt(13))cos(t), -(6/sqrt(13))sin(t), 0>\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion (τ) at t = pi/4:\n\nτ = -N(t) • B'(t) at t = pi/4\nτ = -<-1, -1, 0> • <(6/sqrt(13))cos(pi/4), -(6/sqrt(13))sin(pi/4), 0>\nτ = -(-3/sqrt(13) - 3/sqrt(13))\nτ = 6/sqrt(13)\n\nSo, the curvature (k) at t = pi/4 is 2sqrt(2)/sqrt(13), and the torsion (τ) is 6/sqrt(13)."
