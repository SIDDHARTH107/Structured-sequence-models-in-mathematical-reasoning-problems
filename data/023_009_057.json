    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written in the form $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = -\\lambda^2, \\quad \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$T'(t) + \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$$\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\n\nwith boundary conditions $X(0) = X(1) = 0$ and initial condition $u(x, 0) = X(x)T(0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem. The solutions are given by:\n\n$$X_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x), \\quad \\lambda_n = n\\pi, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\n\nNow, solve the first equation for each $n$:\n\n$$T_n'(t) + n^2\\pi^2 T_n(t) = 0$$\n\nThe solution is given by:\n\n$$T_n(t) = e^{-n^2\\pi^2 t}$$\n\nNow, we have the solutions $u_n(x, t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = \\sin(n\\pi x)e^{-n^2\\pi^2 t}$. To find the general solution, we take the linear combination of these solutions:\n\n$$u(x, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n \\sin(n\\pi x)e^{-n^2\\pi^2 t}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $c_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. This gives:\n\n$$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nComparing the terms, we see that $c_1 = 1$ and $c_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Therefore, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\n$$u(x, t) = \\sin(\\pi x)e^{-\\pi^2 t}$$"
