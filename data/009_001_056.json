    "message_1": "Here's a population growth model problem for the student to solve:\n\nConsider a population of rabbits. It is observed that the rabbit population doubles every two years in the absence of predation. If the initial population of rabbits is 50, how many rabbits are expected to be present after 10 years? Use the appropriate differential equation to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the exponential growth model, which is given by the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, and k is the growth rate constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of k. We know that the population doubles every two years, so:\n\nP(t=2) = 2 * P(t=0)\n\nPlugging this into the exponential growth equation, we get:\n\nP(t=2) = P(t=0) * e^(k*2)\n\n2 * P(t=0) = P(t=0) * e^(k*2)\n\nDivide both sides by P(t=0):\n\n2 = e^(k*2)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = k*2\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nk = ln(2) / 2\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can find the population after 10 years:\n\nP(t=10) = P(t=0) * e^(k*10)\n\nP(t=10) = 50 * e^((ln(2)/2)*10)\n\nP(t=10) = 50 * e^(5*ln(2))\n\nP(t=10) = 50 * 2^5\n\nP(t=10) = 50 * 32\n\nP(t=10) = 1600\n\nSo, after 10 years, there are expected to be 1600 rabbits in the population."
