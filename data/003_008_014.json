    "message_2": "To calculate the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we need to find the angles of the triangle and use the sine function. Since we have the base and height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's denote the base as b, the height as h, and the hypotenuse as c. The base and height form a right-angled triangle with the hypotenuse.\n\nb = 10 meters\nh = 6 meters\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nc^2 = b^2 + h^2\nc^2 = (10)^2 + (6)^2\nc^2 = 100 + 36\nc^2 = 136\nc = √136\nc ≈ 11.66 meters\n\nNow, let's find the angles of the triangle. We can use the sine, cosine, or tangent functions. Let's use the sine function.\n\nLet A be the angle opposite the height (h) and B be the angle opposite the base (b).\n\nsin(A) = opposite/hypotenuse = h/c\nsin(A) = 6/11.66\nA = arcsin(6/11.66)\nA ≈ 30.96°\n\nNow, let's find angle B.\n\nsin(B) = opposite/hypotenuse = b/c\nsin(B) = 10/11.66\nB = arcsin(10/11.66)\nB ≈ 59.04°\n\nNow that we have the angles and the lengths of the sides, we can use the sine formula to calculate the area of the triangle.\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nIn our case, a = 6 meters, b = 10 meters, and C is the angle between a and b, which is the right angle (90°).\n\nArea = (1/2) * 6 * 10 * sin(90°)\nArea = 3 * 10 * 1 (since sin(90°) = 1)\nArea = 30 square meters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 30 square meters."
