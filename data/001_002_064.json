    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (6, 9), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The slope can be found using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\nUsing the given points (2, 5) and (6, 9), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nm = (9 - 5) / (6 - 2)\nm = 4 / 4\nm = 1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the slope (m = 1) and one of the points, for example (2, 5), we can plug in the values:\n\ny - 5 = 1(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation to get the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\ny - 5 = x - 2\ny = x + 3\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (6, 9) is y = x + 3."
