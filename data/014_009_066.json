    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext using a Feistel cipher with two rounds, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext into two equal parts: L0 (left half) and R0 (right half).\n2. Perform the first round of encryption using subkey K1.\n3. Perform the second round of encryption using subkey K2.\n4. Combine the resulting L2 and R2 to get the ciphertext.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext (10111010) into two equal parts:\n   L0 = 1011\n   R0 = 1010\n\n2. First round of encryption using K1 (01110100):\n   L1 = R0 = 1010\n   R1 = L0 XOR F(R0, K1) = 1011 XOR F(1010, 01110100)\n   To calculate F(R0, K1), we can use a simple XOR operation (in practice, this function can be more complex):\n   F(R0, K1) = R0 XOR K1 = 1010 XOR 0111 = 1101\n   R1 = 1011 XOR 1101 = 0110\n\n3. Second round of encryption using K2 (10101010):\n   L2 = R1 = 0110\n   R2 = L1 XOR F(R1, K2) = 1010 XOR F(0110, 10101010)\n   To calculate F(R1, K2), we can use a simple XOR operation (in practice, this function can be more complex):\n   F(R1, K2) = R1 XOR K2 = 0110 XOR 1010 = 1100\n   R2 = 1010 XOR 1100 = 0110\n\n4. Combine L2 and R2 to get the ciphertext:\n   Ciphertext = L2 || R2 = 0110 || 0110 = 01100110\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext for the given plaintext and subkeys using a Feistel cipher with two rounds of encryption is 01100110."
