    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative polynomial ring $k<x,y>$ over the field $k$. Let $A$ be an algebra in this ring defined by the relations $xy = 2yx$ and $y^2 = 0$. Find the centralizer of $A$ in this ring, i.e., the set of all elements $f \\in k<x,y>$ such that $fa = af$ for all $a \\in A$.",
    "message_2": "Let $C(A)$ denote the centralizer of $A$ in $k<x,y>$. We want to find all elements $f \\in k<x,y>$ such that $fa = af$ for all $a \\in A$. Since $A$ is generated by $x$ and $y$ subject to the relations $xy = 2yx$ and $y^2 = 0$, it suffices to consider the cases when $a = x$ and $a = y$. \n\nLet $f = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^j \\in k<x,y>$, where $c_{ij} \\in k$. We have the following two conditions for $f$ to be in $C(A)$:\n\n1. $fx = xf$ for all $f \\in k<x,y>$, i.e., $\\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^{i+1} y^j = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^j x$.\n2. $fy = yf$ for all $f \\in k<x,y>$, i.e., $\\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^{j+1} = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} y x^i y^j$.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n1. Comparing coefficients of $x^{i+1} y^j$ on both sides, we get $c_{ij} = c_{i-1,j}$ for all $i,j \\geq 0$. This implies that all the coefficients in each row of the matrix $(c_{ij})$ are equal, i.e., $c_{ij} = c_{0j}$ for all $i,j \\geq 0$.\n\n2. Using the relation $xy = 2yx$, we can rewrite the right-hand side of the second condition as $\\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} (2x^i y^j - x^{i-1} y^{j+1})$. Comparing coefficients of $x^i y^{j+1}$ on both sides, we get $c_{ij} = 2c_{i-1,j} - c_{i,j+1}$ for all $i,j \\geq 0$. \n\nNow, let's find a general expression for $c_{ij}$. From condition 1, we have $c_{ij} = c_{0j}$. Using condition 2, we get $c_{0j} = 2c_{0,j-1} - c_{1,j} = 2(2c_{0,j-2} - c_{1,j-1}) - c_{1,j} = 4c_{0,j-2} - 2c_{1,j-1} - c_{1,j}$.\n\nSince $c_{1j} = c_{00}$ for all $j \\geq 0$, we can write $c_{0j} = 4c_{0,j-2} - 2c_{00} - c_{00} = 4c_{0,j-2} - 3c_{00}$. Iterating this expression, we get $c_{0j} = 3^j c_{00}$ for all $j \\geq 0$.\n\nThus, the general form of $f$ is given by $f = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^j = \\sum_{i,j} c_{00} 3^j x^i y^j = c_{00} \\sum_{i,j} 3^j x^i y^j$, where $c_{00} \\in k$. Therefore, the centralizer $C(A)$ consists of all scalar multiples of the element $\\sum_{i,j} 3^j x^i y^j$ in the noncommutative polynomial ring $k<x,y>$."
