    "message_1": "A pizza restaurant serves a large pizza with a diameter of 16 inches. If a slice of pizza is cut into a sector with an angle of 60 degrees, what is the perimeter of the sector? (Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a unit)",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 16 inches, the radius is half of that:\n\nRadius = Diameter / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 inches\n\nNow, let's find the length of the arc. To do this, we'll use the formula:\n\nArc length = (angle / 360) * 2 * π * radius\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees, so the formula becomes:\n\nArc length = (60 / 360) * 2 * π * 8\n\nArc length = (1/6) * 2 * π * 8\n\nArc length = (1/3) * π * 8\n\nArc length ≈ (1/3) * 3.1416 * 8\n\nArc length ≈ 8.3776 inches\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * Radius\n\nPerimeter = 8.3776 + 2 * 8\n\nPerimeter ≈ 8.4 + 16\n\nPerimeter ≈ 24.4 inches\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 24.4 inches, rounded to the nearest tenth of a unit."
