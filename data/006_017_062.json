    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring on any of the 10 main roads, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring on any of the roads and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring on a specific road is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince there are 10 main roads, the probability of no accidents occurring on all 10 roads is (0.8)^10 = 0.1073741824.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one accident occurring by subtracting the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\n1 - 0.1073741824 = 0.8926258176.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one accident occurring on any of the 10 main roads in a given day is approximately 0.8926 or 89.26%."
