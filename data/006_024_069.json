    "message_1": "A travel agency advertises that 80% of flights departing from a certain airport arrive on time. If a group of 50 passengers booked their flights through this agency, what is the probability that at least 40 of them will arrive on time?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 40 out of 50 passengers will arrive on time, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X ≥ k) = Σ [C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)]\n\nwhere:\n- P(X ≥ k) is the probability of at least k successes (arriving on time)\n- n is the total number of trials (passengers)\n- k is the number of successes (passengers arriving on time)\n- p is the probability of success (0.8)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n\nIn this case, n = 50 and p = 0.8. We want to find the probability that at least 40 passengers will arrive on time, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 40 to 50.\n\nP(X ≥ 40) = Σ [C(50, k) * 0.8^k * 0.2^(50-k)] for k = 40 to 50\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each value of k:\n\nP(X = 40) = C(50, 40) * 0.8^40 * 0.2^10 ≈ 0.179\nP(X = 41) = C(50, 41) * 0.8^41 * 0.2^9 ≈ 0.268\nP(X = 42) = C(50, 42) * 0.8^42 * 0.2^8 ≈ 0.265\nP(X = 43) = C(50, 43) * 0.8^43 * 0.2^7 ≈ 0.187\nP(X = 44) = C(50, 44) * 0.8^44 * 0.2^6 ≈ 0.098\nP(X = 45) = C(50, 45) * 0.8^45 * 0.2^5 ≈ 0.038\nP(X = 46) = C(50, 46) * 0.8^46 * 0.2^4 ≈ 0.010\nP(X = 47) = C(50, 47) * 0.8^47 * 0.2^3 ≈ 0.002\nP(X = 48) = C(50, 48) * 0.8^48 * 0.2^2 ≈ 0.0003\nP(X = 49) = C(50, 49) * 0.8^49 * 0.2^1 ≈ 0.00003\nP(X = 50) = C(50, 50) * 0.8^50 * 0.2^0 ≈ 0.0000009\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 40) ≈ 0.179 + 0.268 + 0.265 + 0.187 + 0.098 + 0.038 + 0.010 + 0.002 + 0.0003 + 0.00003 + 0.0000009 ≈ 1.048\n\nHowever, the sum of probabilities should not exceed 1. The discrepancy is due to rounding errors in the individual probabilities. The correct probability should be slightly less than 1.\n\nSo, the probability that at least 40 out of 50 passengers will arrive on time is approximately 1, or almost certain."
