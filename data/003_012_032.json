    "message_1": "A building stands 20 meters tall. From the ground, an observer finds the angle of elevation to be 45 degrees looking up to the top of the building. What is the horizontal distance between the observer and the building? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (20 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the horizontal distance between the observer and the building (which we want to find).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(45) = 20 / horizontal_distance\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = 20 / horizontal_distance\n\nNow, we can solve for the horizontal distance:\n\nhorizontal_distance = 20\n\nThe horizontal distance between the observer and the building is 20 meters."
