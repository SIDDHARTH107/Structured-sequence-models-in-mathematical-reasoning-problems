    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x - 5 on the interval [0, 2], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x + 4\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. By testing the factors of the constant term (4) and the leading coefficient (4), we find that x = 1 is a root:\n\n4(1)^3 - 12(1)^2 + 12(1) + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n          x^2 - 3x + 4\n    ________________________\n1 | 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x + 4\n\n      4x^3 - 4x^2\n      ___________\n           -8x^2 + 12x\n           -8x^2 + 8x\n           ___________\n                 4x + 4\n                 4x + 4\n                 _______\n                      0\n\nSo, the factored form of the derivative is:\n\nf'(x) = (x - 1)(x^2 - 3x + 4)\n\nThe quadratic factor (x^2 - 3x + 4) has no real roots, as its discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative:\n\n(-3)^2 - 4(1)(4) = 9 - 16 = -7\n\nThus, the only critical point is x = 1.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval [0, 2]:\n\nf(0) = (0)^4 - 4(0)^3 + 6(0)^2 + 4(0) - 5 = -5\nf(1) = (1)^4 - 4(1)^3 + 6(1)^2 + 4(1) - 5 = 1 - 4 + 6 + 4 - 5 = 2\nf(2) = (2)^4 - 4(2)^3 + 6(2)^2 + 4(2) - 5 = 16 - 32 + 24 + 8 - 5 = 11\n\nThe maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 2] is 11, which occurs at x = 2."
