    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+3) + log(x-1) = log(12), we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation using the product rule of logarithms, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(ab):\n\nlog((x+3)(x-1)) = log(12)\n\nNow we have log((x+3)(x-1)) = log(12). Since the logarithms are equal, we can set the arguments (the expressions inside the logarithms) equal to each other:\n\n(x+3)(x-1) = 12\n\nNow we can solve for x by expanding the left side of the equation and then simplifying:\n\nx^2 - x + 3x - 3 = 12\nx^2 + 2x - 3 = 12\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 15 = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation, which we can solve by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is the easiest method:\n\n(x + 5)(x - 3) = 0\n\nNow we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx + 5 = 0 or x - 3 = 0\nx = -5 or x = 3\n\nHowever, we must check our solutions to make sure they are valid in the original equation. If we plug x = -5 back into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog(-5 + 3) + log(-5 - 1) = log(12)\nlog(-2) + log(-6) = log(12)\n\nSince the logarithm of a negative number is undefined, x = -5 is not a valid solution.\n\nNow let's check x = 3:\n\nlog(3 + 3) + log(3 - 1) = log(12)\nlog(6) + log(2) = log(12)\n\nUsing the product rule of logarithms in reverse, we can combine the two logarithms on the left side:\n\nlog(6 * 2) = log(12)\nlog(12) = log(12)\n\nSince the equation is true, x = 3 is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation log(x+3) + log(x-1) = log(12) is x = 3."
