    "message_1": "A stream cipher uses a key stream of integers generated by a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to encrypt a message. If the LFSR has a period of 127 and the initial state is 01111001, what is the 20th key in the key stream?",
    "message_2": "To find the 20th key in the key stream, we need to iterate the LFSR 19 times (since the initial state is the 1st key). The LFSR has a period of 127, which means it will repeat its sequence after 127 iterations. \n\nAn LFSR generates the next state by XORing (exclusive OR) the current state with a feedback polynomial. However, the problem statement does not provide the feedback polynomial. Without this information, we cannot determine the 20th key in the key stream."
