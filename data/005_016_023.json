    "message_2": "To determine which class the new data point (3, 4) belongs to according to the linear discriminant analysis, we need to calculate the discriminant score for each class and compare them. The class with the higher discriminant score will be the one the new data point belongs to.\n\nThe discriminant score for each class can be calculated using the following formula:\n\ng_i(x) = x^T * W_i * x + w_i^T * x + w_i0\n\nwhere x is the new data point, W_i is the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix for class i, w_i is the product of the mean vector for class i and W_i, and w_i0 is a constant term for class i.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the inverse of the variance-covariance matrices for both classes:\n\nClass 1:\n\n| 2   1 |^-1 = | 2/3  -1/3 |\n| 1   2 |      | -1/3  2/3 |\n\nClass 2:\n\n| 3   -1 |^-1 = | 1/4  1/4 |\n| -1   3 |      | 1/4  1/4 |\n\nNow, let's calculate the discriminant scores for both classes:\n\nClass 1:\n\nW_1 = | 2/3  -1/3 |\n      | -1/3  2/3 |\n\nw_1 = W_1 * mean vector = | 2/3  -1/3 | * | 1 | = | 1/3 |\n                           | -1/3  2/3 |   | 2 |   | 1/3 |\n\ng_1(x) = (3, 4) * | 2/3  -1/3 | * | 3 | + (1/3, 1/3) * (3, 4) + w_10\n                  | -1/3  2/3 |   | 4 |\n\ng_1(x) = 3.67 + w_10 (We don't need to calculate w_10 since we only need to compare the discriminant scores)\n\nClass 2:\n\nW_2 = | 1/4  1/4 |\n      | 1/4  1/4 |\n\nw_2 = W_2 * mean vector = | 1/4  1/4 | * | 4 | = | 5/2 |\n                           | 1/4  1/4 |   | 6 |   | 5/2 |\n\ng_2(x) = (3, 4) * | 1/4  1/4 | * | 3 | + (5/2, 5/2) * (3, 4) + w_20\n                  | 1/4  1/4 |   | 4 |\n\ng_2(x) = 15.5 + w_20 (We don't need to calculate w_20 since we only need to compare the discriminant scores)\n\nComparing the discriminant scores, we have g_1(x) = 3.67 + w_10 and g_2(x) = 15.5 + w_20. Since 15.5 > 3.67, the new data point (3, 4) belongs to Class 2 according to the linear discriminant analysis."
