    "message_2": "Proof that X is compact:\n\nTo prove that X is compact, we need to show that every open cover of X has a finite subcover. Let's consider an arbitrary open cover {U_i} of X. We will show that there exists a finite subcover of {U_i} that covers X.\n\nAssume for contradiction that there is no finite subcover of {U_i} that covers X. Then, for each x in X, there exists a sequence {x_n} such that x_n is in U_i but not in any finite subcover of {U_i}. Since X has the property that every sequence has a convergent subsequence, there exists a subsequence {x_n_k} of {x_n} that converges to a limit L in X.\n\nSince {U_i} is an open cover of X, there exists an open set U_j in {U_i} that contains L. Since U_j is open, there exists an open interval (L-ε, L+ε) contained in U_j for some ε > 0. Since {x_n_k} converges to L, there exists a natural number N such that for all k > N, x_n_k is in (L-ε, L+ε) and hence in U_j. However, this contradicts our assumption that x_n is not in any finite subcover of {U_i}, because x_n_k is in U_j for all k > N.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there is no finite subcover of {U_i} that covers X must be false. Hence, every open cover of X has a finite subcover, and X is compact.\n\nNumerical problem:\n\nLet X = [0,1] and consider any sequence {x_n} in X. We want to show that there exists a subsequence {x_n_k} of {x_n} that converges to a limit in X.\n\nSince X is a closed and bounded interval, it is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem. Therefore, every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence. So, given any sequence {x_n} in X, there exists a subsequence {x_n_k} that converges to a limit L in X. Since L is in X, L is in the interval [0,1]. Thus, we have shown that there exists a subsequence {x_n_k} of {x_n} that converges to a limit in X."
