    "message_1": "An organization's cybersecurity team has found that the probability of a certain type of cyber attack occurring on their network is 0.05. If the organization has 1000 employees and assuming that the probability is the same for every employee, what is the expected number of employees who will be affected by this type of cyber attack?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of employees affected by this type of cyber attack, we can multiply the total number of employees by the probability of the attack occurring for each employee.\n\nExpected number of employees affected = Total number of employees × Probability of attack\n\nExpected number of employees affected = 1000 × 0.05\n\nExpected number of employees affected = 50\n\nSo, the expected number of employees who will be affected by this type of cyber attack is 50."
