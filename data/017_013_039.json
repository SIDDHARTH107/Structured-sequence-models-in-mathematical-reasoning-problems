    "message_2": "To prove that there exists a group of order 18 that is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a non-abelian group of order 6, we will first find a cyclic group of order 3 and a non-abelian group of order 6, and then show that their direct product has order 18.\n\nLet's consider the cyclic group of order 3, denoted as C_3. This group can be represented as {1, a, a^2}, where a has order 3 (i.e., a^3 = 1).\n\nNow, let's consider the symmetric group S_3, which is a non-abelian group of order 6. This group can be represented as {e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)}, where e is the identity element and the other elements are permutations of the set {1, 2, 3}.\n\nNow, we will consider the direct product of these two groups, denoted as C_3 × S_3. This group consists of ordered pairs (x, y), where x is an element of C_3 and y is an element of S_3. The group operation is defined as (x1, y1) * (x2, y2) = (x1 * x2, y1 * y2), where * denotes the group operation in each respective group.\n\nThe order of C_3 × S_3 is equal to the product of the orders of C_3 and S_3, which is 3 * 6 = 18. Therefore, C_3 × S_3 is a group of order 18.\n\nNow, we need to show that C_3 × S_3 is isomorphic to the desired group. To do this, we will define an isomorphism φ: C_3 × S_3 → G, where G is the desired group.\n\nLet φ((x, y)) = x * y, where x is an element of C_3 and y is an element of S_3. We need to show that φ is a homomorphism and bijective.\n\n1. Homomorphism: For any (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in C_3 × S_3, we have\n   φ((x1, y1) * (x2, y2)) = φ((x1 * x2, y1 * y2)) = (x1 * x2) * (y1 * y2) = (x1 * y1) * (x2 * y2) = φ((x1, y1)) * φ((x2, y2)).\n\n2. Injective: If φ((x1, y1)) = φ((x2, y2)), then (x1 * y1) = (x2 * y2). Since x1 and x2 are elements of C_3 and y1 and y2 are elements of S_3, this implies that x1 = x2 and y1 = y2. Therefore, (x1, y1) = (x2, y2), and φ is injective.\n\n3. Surjective: For any element g in G, there exist unique x in C_3 and y in S_3 such that g = x * y. Then, φ((x, y)) = x * y = g, so φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism and bijective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, there exists a group of order 18 that is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a non-abelian group of order 6, as desired."
