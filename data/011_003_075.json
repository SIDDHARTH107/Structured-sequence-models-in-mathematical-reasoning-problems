    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (52 cards in this case), k is the number of items we want to choose (5 cards), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, in this case, we have:\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5!(52-5)!)\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5!47!)\n\nC(52, 5) = (52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(52, 5) = 2,598,960\n\nThere are 2,598,960 ways to choose 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards."
