    "message_2": "The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr(h + r)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 cm and the height (h) is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(4)(6 + 4)\nSurface Area = 2π(4)(10)\nSurface Area = 80π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 80 * 3.14\nSurface Area ≈ 251.2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 251.2 square centimeters, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
