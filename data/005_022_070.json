    "message_2": "To find the median of a data set, we first need to arrange the numbers in ascending order, which is already done in this case. The median is the middle value when the data set is ordered. If there are an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nThere are 14 numbers in this data set, which is an even number. So, we need to find the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe middle values are the 7th and 8th numbers in the ordered data set:\n\n3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, (13), (20), 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28\n\nThe 7th number is 13, and the 8th number is 20. To find the average of these two numbers, we add them together and divide by 2:\n\n(13 + 20) / 2 = 33 / 2 = 16.5\n\nSo, the median of this data set is 16.5. This method of computing the median is robust to outliers, as it only considers the middle values of the ordered data set and is not affected by extremely high or low values."
