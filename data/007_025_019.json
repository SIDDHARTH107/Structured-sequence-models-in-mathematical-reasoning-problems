    "message_1": "Suppose Alice and Bob are communicating over a public channel and want to exchange a secret key. They agree to use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol with prime number p = 23 and base g = 5. Alice chooses a secret number a = 6, and Bob chooses a secret number b = 9. Calculate the secret key that they will both compute and use for secure communication.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the base, a is Alice's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their computed values A and B over the public channel.\n4. Alice computes the secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n5. Bob computes the secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n6. If the protocol is successful, K_A and K_B will be the same, and this will be the shared secret key.\n\nNow, let's compute the secret key using the given values:\n\n1. Alice computes A = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8.\n2. Bob computes B = 5^9 mod 23 = 1953125 mod 23 = 2.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B, so Alice has B = 2 and Bob has A = 8.\n4. Alice computes K_A = 2^6 mod 23 = 64 mod 23 = 18.\n5. Bob computes K_B = 8^9 mod 23 = 134217728 mod 23 = 18.\n\nSince K_A and K_B are the same, the shared secret key is 18. Alice and Bob will use this secret key for secure communication."
