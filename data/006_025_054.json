    "message_1": "A magician has a deck of 52 cards, including 4 aces. During a card trick, the magician asks a volunteer to select a card at random. What is the probability that the volunteer selects one of the 4 aces from the deck?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting one of the 4 aces from a deck of 52 cards, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is selecting one of the 4 aces, and the total number of possible outcomes is selecting any of the 52 cards in the deck.\n\nProbability = (4 aces) / (52 cards) = 4/52\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n\nProbability = (4/4) / (52/4) = 1/13\n\nSo, the probability of selecting one of the 4 aces from the deck is 1/13, or approximately 0.0769, or 7.69%."
