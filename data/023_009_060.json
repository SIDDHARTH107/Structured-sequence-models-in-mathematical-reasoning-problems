    "message_1": "A steel bar of length 10 cm and cross-sectional area 2 cm² is fixed at both ends. At time t=0, the bar has a temperature distribution given by f(x)=cos(πx/10), where x represents the distance from one end of the bar. Assume that the bar is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, which are at a constant temperature of 0°C. How will the temperature distribution of the bar change over time, according to the heat equation? Use the Fourier transform to solve this boundary value problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we will use the heat equation and the method of separation of variables. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = k * ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature distribution of the bar at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity of the steel bar.\n\nSince the bar is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = u(10,t) = 0\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nu(x,0) = f(x) = cos(πx/10)\n\nNow, we apply the method of separation of variables by assuming that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x) * T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = k * X''(x) * T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x) * T(t), we get:\n\n(T'(t) / T(t)) = (k * X''(x) / X(x))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ²\nk * X''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT'(t) = -λ² * T(t)\nk * X''(x) = -λ² * X(x)\n\nSolving the second equation for X(x), we get the following general solution:\n\nX(x) = A * cos(√(λ²/k) * x) + B * sin(√(λ²/k) * x)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we have:\n\nX(0) = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) = A = 0\nX(10) = A * cos(√(λ²/k) * 10) + B * sin(√(λ²/k) * 10) = 0\n\nSince A = 0, we have:\n\nX(x) = B * sin(√(λ²/k) * x)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of λ that satisfy the boundary condition X(10) = 0:\n\nsin(√(λ²/k) * 10) = 0\n\nThis implies that:\n\n√(λ²/k) * 10 = n * π\n\nwhere n is an integer. Thus, we have:\n\nλ² = (n² * π² * k) / 100\n\nNow, we can solve the first ordinary differential equation for T(t):\n\nT'(t) = -λ² * T(t)\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C * exp(-λ² * t)\n\nThe complete solution for u(x,t) is given by the sum of the product of X(x) and T(t) for all values of n:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [B_n * sin(n * π * x / 10) * exp(-(n² * π² * k * t) / 100)]\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = f(x):\n\nf(x) = cos(πx/10) = Σ [B_n * sin(n * π * x / 10)]\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and the coefficients B_n can be found using the following formula:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nIn this case, L = 10, and f(x) = cos(πx/10). So, we have:\n\nB_n = (1/5) * ∫[cos(πx/10) * sin(n * π * x / 10) dx] from 0 to 10\n\nOnly B_1 will be nonzero, and all other B_n will be zero. Therefore, the final solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = B_1 * sin(π * x / 10) * exp(-(π² * k * t) / 100)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution of the steel bar as a function of position x and time t, according to the heat equation."
