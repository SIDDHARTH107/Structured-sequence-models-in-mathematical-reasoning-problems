    "message_1": "Suppose there are 5 different types of candies available in a candy shop. How many ways are there to select a total of 10 candies, if each type of candy can be chosen any number of times?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the concept of combinations with repetitions. Since there are 5 types of candies and we want to select 10 candies in total, we can think of this problem as distributing 10 candies into 5 types.\n\nUsing the formula for combinations with repetitions, which is:\n\nC(n+r-1, r) = C(n+r-1, n-1)\n\nwhere n is the number of types of candies (5) and r is the total number of candies to be selected (10).\n\nC(5+10-1, 10) = C(14, 10) = 14! / (10! * 4!)\n\nCalculating the factorial values:\n\n14! = 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 87,178,291,200\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nNow, divide the factorials:\n\n87,178,291,200 / (3,628,800 * 24) = 2002\n\nSo, there are 2002 ways to select a total of 10 candies from 5 different types of candies, with each type of candy being chosen any number of times."
