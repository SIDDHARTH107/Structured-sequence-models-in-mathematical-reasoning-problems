If so, what is the sequence of vertices that make up the cycle? If not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "Yes, there is a Hamiltonian cycle in this graph. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. The sequence of vertices that make up the Hamiltonian cycle is:\n\n1 - 2 - 6 - 4 - 5 - 3 - 1\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, vertex 1."
