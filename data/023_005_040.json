    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-at) u(t). The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nFor f(t) = e^(-at) u(t), the Fourier transform is:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-at) * e^(-jωt) * u(t)] dt\n\nSince u(t) is the unit step function, the integral is taken from 0 to infinity:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-at) * e^(-jωt)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-(a + jω)t)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, integrate with respect to t:\n\nF(ω) = [-1/(a + jω) * e^(-(a + jω)t)] from 0 to ∞\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\nF(ω) = [-1/(a + jω) * e^(-(a + jω)∞)] - [-1/(a + jω) * e^(-(a + jω)0)]\n\nThe first term goes to 0 as t goes to infinity, and the second term becomes:\n\nF(ω) = 1/(a + jω)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier transform of f(t). To solve the differential equation y'' + 2a y' + a^2 y = f(t), we can take the Fourier transform of both sides:\n\nY''(ω) + 2a Y'(ω) + a^2 Y(ω) = F(ω)\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = F(ω) / (a^2 + 2a(jω) + (jω)^2)\n\nY(ω) = [1/(a + jω)] / (a^2 - ω^2 + 2ajω)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to find the solution y(t):\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) ∫[Y(ω) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) ∫[(1/(a + jω)) * (1/(a^2 - ω^2 + 2ajω)) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\nThis integral is difficult to evaluate directly. However, we can use the convolution theorem, which states that the inverse Fourier transform of the product of two functions is equal to the convolution of the inverse Fourier transforms of the individual functions. Let g(t) be the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(a^2 - ω^2 + 2ajω). Then:\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) ∫[f(τ) * g(t - τ)] dτ\n\nSince f(t) = e^(-at) u(t), we have:\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) ∫[e^(-aτ) * u(τ) * g(t - τ)] dτ\n\nThe integral is taken from 0 to t, as u(τ) is nonzero only for τ ≥ 0:\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) ∫[e^(-aτ) * g(t - τ)] dτ from 0 to t\n\nThis is the solution to the given differential equation y'' + 2a y' + a^2 y = f(t) with the initial conditions y(0) = y'(0) = 0."
