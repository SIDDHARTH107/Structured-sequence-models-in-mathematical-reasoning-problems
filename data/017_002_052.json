    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group generated by 5, every element in G can be written in the form 5^n, where n is an integer. Now, let H be a non-trivial subgroup of G, which means H has at least one element other than the identity element (1 in this case).\n\nLet m be the smallest positive integer such that 5^m is in H. We claim that H is generated by 5^m, i.e., H = <5^m>.\n\nTo prove this, let's take any element h in H. Since h is also an element of G, we can write h = 5^n for some integer n. By the division algorithm, we can write n = mq + r, where q and r are integers, and 0 â‰¤ r < m.\n\nNow, we have h = 5^n = 5^{mq + r} = (5^m)^q * 5^r. Since 5^m is in H and H is a subgroup, (5^m)^q is also in H. Therefore, the inverse element (5^m)^{-q} is in H as well. Multiplying both sides by (5^m)^{-q}, we get:\n\n(5^m)^{-q} * h = 5^r.\n\nSince the left-hand side is a product of elements in H, 5^r must also be in H. But we chose m to be the smallest positive integer such that 5^m is in H, so r must be 0 (otherwise, we would have a smaller positive integer r with 5^r in H, which contradicts the minimality of m). Thus, h = (5^m)^q, which means h is generated by 5^m.\n\nSince h was an arbitrary element in H, we have shown that every element in H can be generated by 5^m. Therefore, H is a cyclic group generated by 5^m, i.e., H = <5^m>."
