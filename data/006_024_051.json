    "message_1": "A student is planning a road trip from Vancouver to Toronto. The total distance between the two cities is 4,347 km. The student plans to stop at three different cities on the way: Calgary, Regina, and Winnipeg. The probability of encountering construction delays in Calgary is 0.3, in Regina is 0.2, and in Winnipeg is 0.4. What is the probability the student will encounter delays in all three cities?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of encountering delays in all three cities, we need to multiply the individual probabilities together.\n\nProbability of delays in all three cities = Probability of delays in Calgary * Probability of delays in Regina * Probability of delays in Winnipeg\n\n= 0.3 * 0.2 * 0.4\n\n= 0.06 * 0.4\n\n= 0.024\n\nSo, the probability of encountering delays in all three cities is 0.024 or 2.4%."
