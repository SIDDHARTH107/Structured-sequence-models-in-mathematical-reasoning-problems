    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 8th iteration:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(8/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^4)\nLength = 1 * 16\nLength = 16 units\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon curve after the 8th iteration is 16 units."
