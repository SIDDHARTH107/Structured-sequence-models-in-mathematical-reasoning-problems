    "message_1": "A 20 Newton force is applied to lift an object weighing 7 kg from the ground and move it vertically upwards to a height of 10 meters. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force using integration, we need to consider the force acting on the object and the distance it is moved. In this case, the force is constant (20 N) and the distance moved is 10 meters.\n\nThe work done (W) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = ∫(F * ds)\n\nwhere F is the force applied (20 N) and ds is the infinitesimal distance moved.\n\nSince the force is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nW = F * ∫(ds)\n\nNow, we need to integrate ds over the distance moved (0 to 10 meters):\n\nW = 20 * ∫(ds) from 0 to 10\n\nW = 20 * [s] from 0 to 10\n\nW = 20 * (10 - 0)\n\nW = 20 * 10\n\nW = 200 J (Joules)\n\nSo, the work done by the force to lift the object and move it vertically upwards to a height of 10 meters is 200 Joules."
