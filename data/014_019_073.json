    "message_1": "A transposition cipher rearranges the letters of a message. If a message consisting of 30 letters is encrypted using a transposition cipher that rearranges the letters in groups of 5, how many different permutations can be made?",
    "message_2": "Since the message is encrypted using a transposition cipher that rearranges the letters in groups of 5, we need to find the number of permutations for each group of 5 letters and then multiply the permutations of all the groups.\n\nThere are 30 letters in the message, so there are 30/5 = 6 groups of 5 letters.\n\nThe number of permutations for each group of 5 letters can be calculated using the formula for permutations: n! (n factorial), where n is the number of elements in the group. In this case, n = 5.\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 permutations for each group.\n\nSince there are 6 groups, the total number of permutations for the entire message is:\n\n120 × 120 × 120 × 120 × 120 × 120 = 120^6 = 3,991,680,000,000 different permutations."
