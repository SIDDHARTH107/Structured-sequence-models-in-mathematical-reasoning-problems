    "message_1": "A factory produces 1000 widgets per hour. The probability of any given widget being defective is 0.02. What is the probability that at least 20 widgets will be defective in a given 8 hour shift?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective widgets\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of widgets produced in an 8-hour shift\n- k is the number of defective widgets (we want at least 20)\n- p is the probability of a widget being defective (0.02)\n- 1-p is the probability of a widget not being defective (0.98)\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of widgets produced in an 8-hour shift:\n\nn = 1000 widgets/hour * 8 hours = 8000 widgets\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of having at least 20 defective widgets. To do this, we can find the probability of having 0 to 19 defective widgets and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)]\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 19:\n\nP(X = k) = C(8000, k) * (0.02)^k * (0.98)^(8000-k)\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities for each value of k, we can sum them up and subtract from 1:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)]\n\nThis calculation can be done using a calculator or software that supports binomial probability calculations. Using such a tool, we find:\n\nP(X >= 20) â‰ˆ 1 - 1.1102230246251565e-16 = 0.9999999999999999\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 20 defective widgets in a given 8-hour shift is approximately 1, or almost certain."
