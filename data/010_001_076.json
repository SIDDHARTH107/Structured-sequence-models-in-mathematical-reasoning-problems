    "message_1": "Let X be a topological space such that its closure is equal to its interior i.e. $\\bar{X}=int(X)$. If X has 10 open sets, how many closed sets does X have?",
    "message_2": "In a topological space, the number of closed sets is equal to the number of open sets. This is because there is a one-to-one correspondence between open sets and closed sets: the complement of an open set is a closed set, and the complement of a closed set is an open set.\n\nSince X has 10 open sets, it also has 10 closed sets."
