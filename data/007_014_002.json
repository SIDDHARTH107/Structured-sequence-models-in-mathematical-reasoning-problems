    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The smallest perfect number is 6, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, and 3. The next perfect number is 28, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14.\n\nPerfect numbers can be found using the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from the study of Mersenne primes. The first few values of p that satisfy this condition are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, ... (sequence A000043 in the OEIS).\n\nUsing this formula, we can find the next three perfect numbers after 28:\n\n1. For p = 5 (2^5 - 1 = 31, which is prime):\n   2^(5-1) * (2^5 - 1) = 16 * 31 = 496\n\n2. For p = 7 (2^7 - 1 = 127, which is prime):\n   2^(7-1) * (2^7 - 1) = 64 * 127 = 8128\n\n3. For p = 13 (2^13 - 1 = 8191, which is prime):\n   2^(13-1) * (2^13 - 1) = 4096 * 8191 = 33,550,336\n\nSo, the next three perfect numbers after 28 are 496, 8128, and 33,550,336."
