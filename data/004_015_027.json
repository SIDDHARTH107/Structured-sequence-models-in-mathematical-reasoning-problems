    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 2x³ - 15x² + 36x, we first need to find the second derivative of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x³ - 15x² + 36x)\nf'(x) = 6x² - 30x + 36\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (6x² - 30x + 36)\nf''(x) = 12x - 30\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x for which f''(x) = 0:\n12x - 30 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n12x = 30\nx = 30/12\nx = 5/2\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 5/2. To find the corresponding y-value, plug this x-value back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(5/2) = 2(5/2)³ - 15(5/2)² + 36(5/2)\nf(5/2) = 2(125/8) - 15(25/4) + 36(5/2)\nf(5/2) = 125/4 - 375/4 + 90/1\nf(5/2) = -250/4 + 360/4\nf(5/2) = 110/4\nf(5/2) = 55/2\n\nSo, the inflection point is at (5/2, 55/2)."
