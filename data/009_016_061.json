    "message_1": "What is the electric potential inside a sphere of radius 5 cm that has a charge density of 3e-6 C/m^3 uniformly distributed within it, given that the potential on its surface is 10 volts and there is no charge outside the sphere? (Assume vacuum permeability and permittivity of free space)",
    "message_2": "To find the electric potential inside the sphere, we can use the formula for the electric potential of a uniformly charged sphere:\n\nV(r) = (Q * (3 * R^2 - r^2)) / (20 * π * ε₀ * R^3)\n\nwhere V(r) is the electric potential at a distance r from the center of the sphere, Q is the total charge of the sphere, R is the radius of the sphere, r is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point where we want to find the potential, and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/N·m²).\n\nFirst, we need to find the total charge Q of the sphere. We can do this using the charge density ρ and the volume of the sphere:\n\nQ = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3 * π * R^3)\n\nGiven the charge density ρ = 3 × 10^(-6) C/m³ and the radius R = 5 cm = 0.05 m, we can calculate the total charge Q:\n\nQ = (3 × 10^(-6) C/m³) * (4/3 * π * (0.05 m)^3) ≈ 1.57 × 10^(-8) C\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the electric potential inside the sphere:\n\nV(r) = (1.57 × 10^(-8) C * (3 * (0.05 m)^2 - r^2)) / (20 * π * (8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/N·m²) * (0.05 m)^3)\n\nSince we are given that the potential on the surface of the sphere is 10 volts, we can set V(r) = 10 V when r = R = 0.05 m:\n\n10 V = (1.57 × 10^(-8) C * (3 * (0.05 m)^2 - (0.05 m)^2)) / (20 * π * (8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/N·m²) * (0.05 m)^3)\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr ≈ 0.037 m\n\nSo, the electric potential inside the sphere at a distance of 0.037 m from the center is approximately 10 volts."
