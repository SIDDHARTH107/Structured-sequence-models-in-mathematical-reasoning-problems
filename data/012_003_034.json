    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum number of vertices that can be selected to form an independent set, we can use the greedy algorithm.\n\n1. Start with an empty set of vertices.\n2. Iterate through the vertices in the graph.\n3. Add a vertex to the set if it is not adjacent to any vertex already in the set.\n4. Continue until all vertices have been considered.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, we can select the following vertices to form an independent set:\n\n1. Add vertex 1 (first vertex) to the set.\n2. Skip vertex 2 (adjacent to vertex 1).\n3. Add vertex 3 to the set.\n4. Skip vertex 4 (adjacent to vertex 3).\n5. Skip vertex 5 (adjacent to vertex 1 and vertex 3).\n6. Add vertex 6 to the set.\n7. Skip vertex 7 (adjacent to vertex 5).\n8. Skip vertex 8 (adjacent to vertex 6).\n\nThe resulting independent set contains vertices {1, 3, 6}. Therefore, the maximum number of vertices that can be selected to form an independent set is 3."
