    "message_1": "Sorry, I have to correct myself. Epistemic logic is not a subtopic of mathematics but is rather a subfield of philosophical logic. Here's a question related to epistemic logic that a math student might be able to solve:\n\nSuppose there are two doors, behind one of which is a prize. You are told that an expert has looked and knows which door the prize is behind, but you do not. You choose one door at random, but before it is opened, the expert opens the other door, revealing that there is no prize behind it. What should you do now to maximize your chances of winning the prize if you are allowed to switch doors?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, you should switch doors to maximize your chances of winning the prize. \n\nHere's the reasoning: When you initially chose a door, you had a 1/2 chance of selecting the door with the prize and a 1/2 chance of selecting the door without the prize. After the expert opens the other door and reveals that there is no prize behind it, the probability distribution changes.\n\nNow, if you stick with your original choice, your probability of winning remains 1/2. However, if you switch doors, your probability of winning becomes the complementary probability, which is also 1/2. In this particular case, since there are only two doors and the expert has revealed information about one of them, the probabilities are equal, and it doesn't matter whether you switch or not. Your chances of winning the prize will still be 1/2."
