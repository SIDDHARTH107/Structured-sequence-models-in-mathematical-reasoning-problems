    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a closed surface S in R^3, the total Gaussian curvature is related to the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface as follows:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nIn this case, the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 3/4. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n(3/4) ∫∫_S dA = 2πχ\n\nTo find the total Gaussian curvature, we need to compute the integral of dA over the surface S. Since S is a closed surface, its area (A) is finite. Let A be the area of the surface S. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n(3/4) * A = 2πχ\n\nNow, we need to know the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface S. The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, which means it depends only on the surface's topology and not on its geometry. For example, χ = 2 for a sphere, χ = 0 for a torus, and χ = -2 for a double torus. Without more information about the surface S, we cannot determine its Euler characteristic.\n\nAssuming we know the Euler characteristic χ of the surface S, we can calculate the total Gaussian curvature as:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = (3/4) * A = 2πχ"
