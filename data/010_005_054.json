    "message_2": "Proof 1: X is connected if A is connected.\n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that X is not connected. Then there exist nonempty open sets U and V in X such that X = U ∪ V and U ∩ V = ∅. We will show that this leads to a contradiction with the assumption that A is connected.\n\nConsider the sets A_U = {(x, y) ∈ A : x ∈ U, y ∈ V} and A_V = {(x, y) ∈ A : x ∈ V, y ∈ U}. We claim that A_U and A_V are nonempty, open, and disjoint subsets of A whose union is A, which would contradict the connectedness of A.\n\n1. Nonempty: Since U and V are nonempty, there exist points u ∈ U and v ∈ V. Then (u, v) ∈ A_U and (v, u) ∈ A_V, so both sets are nonempty.\n\n2. Open: Let (x, y) ∈ A_U. Since U and V are open in X, there exist open neighborhoods U_x ⊆ U of x and V_y ⊆ V of y. Then (U_x × V_y) ∩ A is an open neighborhood of (x, y) in A, and it is contained in A_U. Thus, A_U is open in A. Similarly, A_V is open in A.\n\n3. Disjoint: If (x, y) ∈ A_U ∩ A_V, then x ∈ U ∩ V and y ∈ U ∩ V, which contradicts the fact that U ∩ V = ∅.\n\n4. Union: For any (x, y) ∈ A, we have x ≠ y, so either x ∈ U and y ∈ V, or x ∈ V and y ∈ U. Thus, (x, y) ∈ A_U or (x, y) ∈ A_V, and so A = A_U ∪ A_V.\n\nSince A_U and A_V are nonempty, open, and disjoint subsets of A whose union is A, this contradicts the connectedness of A. Therefore, our assumption that X is not connected must be false, and so X is connected.\n\nProof 2: If every point in X is joined by a path to every other point in X, X is path-connected.\n\nLet x, y ∈ X be arbitrary points. By assumption, there exists a path p: [0, 1] → X such that p(0) = x and p(1) = y. Since p is continuous and [0, 1] is connected, the image p([0, 1]) is connected in X. Since x and y are arbitrary, this shows that any two points in X can be connected by a path, which is the definition of path-connectedness. Therefore, X is path-connected."
