    "message_1": "A chocolate factory claims that their bags of chocolates contain an average of 250 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. To test this claim, a random sample of 25 bags of chocolates is taken and weighed. The sample mean is found to be 245 grams. Can we reject the factory's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the factory's claim, we will perform a one-sample z-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean weight of the bags of chocolates is 250 grams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean weight is not 250 grams.\n\nH0: μ = 250 grams\nH1: μ ≠ 250 grams\n\nGiven information:\n- Population mean (μ) = 250 grams\n- Population standard deviation (σ) = 10 grams\n- Sample size (n) = 25\n- Sample mean (x̄) = 245 grams\n- Level of significance (α) = 5% = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the z-score for the sample mean:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nz = (245 - 250) / (10 / √25)\nz = (-5) / (10 / 5)\nz = -5 / 2\nz = -2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance. Since α = 0.05, we will have 0.025 in each tail. Looking up the z-table or using a calculator, we find the critical z-values to be -1.96 and 1.96.\n\nSince our calculated z-score (-2.5) is less than the critical z-value (-1.96), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) at a 5% level of significance. This means that there is enough evidence to suggest that the true mean weight of the bags of chocolates is not 250 grams."
