    "message_2": "To identify the cut vertices and bridges in the graph G, we first need to understand their definitions:\n\n- A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n- A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given graph:\n\n![Graph image](https://i.imgur.com/4Cvjt0E.png)\n\nCut vertices:\n1. Vertex A: If we remove vertex A, the graph will be split into two connected components: {B, C, D, E} and {F, G, H}.\n2. Vertex E: If we remove vertex E, the graph will be split into two connected components: {A, B, C, D} and {F, G, H}.\n\nBridges:\n1. Edge (A, E): If we remove edge (A, E), the graph will be split into two connected components: {A, F, G, H} and {B, C, D, E}.\n2. Edge (D, E): If we remove edge (D, E), the graph will be split into two connected components: {A, B, C, D} and {E, F, G, H}.\n\nSo, the cut vertices in the graph G are A and E, and the bridges are edges (A, E) and (D, E)."
