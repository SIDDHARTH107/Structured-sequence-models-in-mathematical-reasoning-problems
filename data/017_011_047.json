    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where a is the element and e is the identity element of the group.\n3. Lagrange's theorem: The order of any subgroup of a finite group G divides the order of G.\n4. A group is cyclic if and only if it has an element whose order is equal to the order of the group.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 12.\nIf G has an element of order 12, then by definition, G is a cyclic group. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 12.\nIf G has no element of order 12, then by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Note that there must be an element of order 1, which is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems:\n\n- If G has an element of order 6, then G has a subgroup of order 6. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 6) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. However, this would imply that G is a semidirect product of a group of order 2 and a group of order 3, which would mean G is cyclic, contradicting our assumption. Therefore, G cannot have an element of order 6.\n\n- If G has an element of order 4, then G has a subgroup of order 4. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 4-subgroups (subgroups of order 4) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 modulo 4. The only possibilities are 1 or 3 Sylow 4-subgroups. If there is only one Sylow 4-subgroup, it must be normal, and G would be a semidirect product of a group of order 4 and a group of order 3. This would imply that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\n- If G has no elements of order 4 or 6, then the only remaining possibility is that all non-identity elements have order 2 or 3. If there is an element of order 3, then G has a subgroup of order 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (subgroups of order 3) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is that there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. Since each Sylow 3-subgroup has 2 non-identity elements, there are a total of 8 elements of order 3 in G. This leaves 3 non-identity elements, which must all have order 2. This structure corresponds to the alternating group A4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
