    "message_2": "The moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 2, denoted by M_2, is the space parameterizing smooth projective curves of genus 2 up to isomorphism. The degree of the moduli space is a numerical invariant that measures the size of the space, and is an important tool in studying the geometry of moduli spaces of mathematical objects.\n\nFor genus 2, the moduli space M_2 is a 3-dimensional projective variety. To compute its degree, we can use the formula for the degree of the canonical class K of M_g, where g is the genus:\n\nK = 13(g-1)λ - 2δ\n\nHere, λ is the Hodge class and δ is the boundary class. For genus 2, we have:\n\nK = 13(2-1)λ - 2δ = 13λ - 2δ\n\nThe degree of M_2 is the intersection number of K^3, which can be computed using the intersection product on the Chow ring of M_2:\n\ndeg(M_2) = K^3 = (13λ - 2δ)^3 = 13^3λ^3 - 3 * 13^2 * 2λ^2δ + 3 * 13 * 2^2λδ^2 - 2^3δ^3\n\nNow, we need to compute the intersection numbers λ^3, λ^2δ, λδ^2, and δ^3. These numbers can be computed using the Mumford's formula for the intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves:\n\n<τ_a1,...,τ_an> = (2g-3+n)! / a1!...an!\n\nFor genus 2, we have:\n\nλ^3 = <τ_0, τ_0, τ_0> = (2*2-3+3)! / 0!0!0! = 5! / 1 = 120\nλ^2δ = <τ_0, τ_0, τ_1> = (2*2-3+3)! / 0!0!1! = 5! / 1 = 120\nλδ^2 = <τ_0, τ_1, τ_1> = (2*2-3+3)! / 0!1!1! = 5! / 2 = 60\nδ^3 = <τ_1, τ_1, τ_1> = (2*2-3+3)! / 1!1!1! = 5! / 6 = 20\n\nPlugging these numbers into the formula for the degree of M_2, we get:\n\ndeg(M_2) = 13^3 * 120 - 3 * 13^2 * 2 * 120 + 3 * 13 * 2^2 * 60 - 2^3 * 20\ndeg(M_2) = 2197 * 120 - 1014 * 120 + 1012 * 60 - 160\ndeg(M_2) = 263640 - 121680 + 60720 - 160\ndeg(M_2) = 202520\n\nTherefore, the degree of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 2 is 202,520."
