    "message_2": "To find the number of perfect matchings in G, we can use the concept of the Handshaking Lemma and the Tutte theorem.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, since there are 8 vertices each with degree 3, the sum of the degrees is 8 * 3 = 24. Therefore, there must be 24 / 2 = 12 edges in the graph.\n\nA perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices in the graph such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In other words, a perfect matching is a set of disjoint edges that together cover all vertices. Since there are 8 vertices in G, a perfect matching must consist of 4 edges.\n\nNow, we can use the Tutte theorem to determine the number of perfect matchings in G. The Tutte theorem states that a graph has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of vertices, the number of connected components in the subgraph induced by the vertices not in U (denoted as G - U) is at most |U|.\n\nIn this case, since each vertex has degree 3, it is not possible to find a subset U of vertices that violates the Tutte theorem condition. Therefore, G has at least one perfect matching.\n\nHowever, determining the exact number of perfect matchings in G is a more complex problem. It can be solved using the Pfaffian orientation method or other combinatorial techniques, but these methods are beyond the scope of a simple explanation.\n\nIn summary, we can conclude that G has at least one perfect matching, but determining the exact number of perfect matchings requires more advanced techniques."
