    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of (A symmetrical difference B) and (B symmetrical difference A), and show that the sets are not equal.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetrical difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetrical difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetrical difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nB Δ A = {1, 4}\n\nNotice that A Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 4}. The symmetrical difference is commutative, which means A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A), denoted as (A Δ B) x (B Δ A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nThe Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A) is {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}.\n\nSince the sets A Δ B and B Δ A are equal, there is no need to show that they are not equal. The problem statement seems to have a misconception. The sets A Δ B and B Δ A are indeed equal, as we have shown above."
