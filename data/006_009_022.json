    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the medical condition, we can multiply the population size by the probability of having the condition:\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = Population size × Probability of having the condition\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 500 × 0.08\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 40\n\nSo, in this population of 500 people, we can expect that 40 people have the medical condition."
