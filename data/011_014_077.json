    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem on Graph theory:\n\nSuppose there are 8 people in a party and each person knows exactly 3 other people in the party. If two people cannot know each other directly, what is the minimum number of tables required in the party such that each table has an even number of people?",
    "message_2": "Let's represent the people as vertices and their relationships as edges in a graph. Since each person knows exactly 3 other people, the degree of each vertex is 3. The sum of the degrees of all vertices in the graph is 8 * 3 = 24. According to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. Therefore, there are 24 / 2 = 12 edges in the graph.\n\nNow, let's consider the tables. Since each table must have an even number of people, we can have tables with 2, 4, 6, or 8 people. However, since no two people who know each other can sit at the same table, we can eliminate the possibility of having a single table with all 8 people.\n\nLet's try to divide the people into two tables with 4 people each. In this case, each person at a table would have to know all 3 people at the other table. However, this would mean that each person would have a degree of 3 in the graph, which is not possible since the total number of edges is 12. Therefore, we cannot have two tables with 4 people each.\n\nNow, let's try to divide the people into four tables with 2 people each. In this case, each person would have to know 3 other people who are not at their table. Since there are 4 tables, each person would have to know someone from each of the other 3 tables. This is possible, as we can arrange the people in such a way that no two people who know each other are sitting at the same table.\n\nFor example, let the people be A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. We can arrange them in the following way:\n\nTable 1: A, B\nTable 2: C, D\nTable 3: E, F\nTable 4: G, H\n\nRelationships:\nA knows C, E, and G\nB knows C, E, and G\nC knows A, B, D\nD knows A, B, C\nE knows A, B, F\nF knows A, B, E\nG knows A, B, H\nH knows A, B, G\n\nIn this arrangement, no two people who know each other are sitting at the same table, and each person knows exactly 3 other people. Therefore, the minimum number of tables required is 4."
