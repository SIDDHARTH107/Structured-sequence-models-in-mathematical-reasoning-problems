    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, two players are given the opportunity to split a sum of money. The first player decides how much money to send to the second player, and the second player then decides how to divide the money. If the second player accepts the offer, both players keep the agreed-upon amounts. Consider a game with $100 to split. Player 1 sends $30 to player 2. What is the maximum amount that player 2 can offer back to player 1 while still expecting player 1 to send any money in the first place?",
    "message_2": "In the Trust Game, player 1 sends an amount to player 2 with the expectation that player 2 will return a fair share. In this case, player 1 sends $30 to player 2, so the total amount to split is now $130 ($100 initially + $30 sent by player 1). \n\nTo ensure that player 1 has an incentive to send any money in the first place, player 2 should offer back an amount that is greater than or equal to the initial $30 sent by player 1. If player 2 offers less than $30, player 1 would have no incentive to send any money, as they would end up with less than their initial amount.\n\nTo maximize the amount player 2 can offer back to player 1, player 2 should offer an amount that is just enough to incentivize player 1 to send money. In this case, player 2 can offer back $30 to player 1, which would leave player 2 with $100 ($130 total - $30 offered back to player 1). This way, player 1 would break even, and player 2 would maximize their share of the money."
