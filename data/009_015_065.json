    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA sample of a radioactive element has an initial mass of 200 grams and a half-life of 50 years. Write a differential equation that models the decay of this element and then calculate:\n\na) The mass of the sample after 100 years have passed\nb) The time it would take for the sample to decay to 25 grams.",
    "message_2": "To model the decay of the radioactive element, we can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nm(t) = m0 * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere m(t) is the mass of the element at time t, m0 is the initial mass, k is the decay constant, and t is the time in years.\n\nFirst, we need to find the decay constant k. We know that the half-life is 50 years, so when t = 50, m(t) = m0 / 2. Plugging this into the formula:\n\nm0 / 2 = m0 * e^(-k * 50)\n\nDivide both sides by m0:\n\n1/2 = e^(-k * 50)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/2) = -k * 50\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nk = -ln(1/2) / 50 ≈ 0.01386\n\nNow we have the decay constant, and we can write the differential equation:\n\nm(t) = 200 * e^(-0.01386t)\n\na) To find the mass of the sample after 100 years, plug in t = 100:\n\nm(100) = 200 * e^(-0.01386 * 100) ≈ 200 * e^(-1.386) ≈ 50.03 grams\n\nb) To find the time it would take for the sample to decay to 25 grams, set m(t) = 25 and solve for t:\n\n25 = 200 * e^(-0.01386t)\n\nDivide both sides by 200:\n\n1/8 = e^(-0.01386t)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/8) = -0.01386t\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\nt = -ln(1/8) / 0.01386 ≈ 150.03 years\n\nSo, it would take approximately 150.03 years for the sample to decay to 25 grams."
