    "message_1": "A student has a knapsack that can hold a maximum weight of 15 kg. The student wants to take some items with them for a trip, but can only take a maximum of 4 items due to limited space in the knapsack. The weights and values of the items are as follows:\n\nItem 1: Weight 4 kg, Value $20\nItem 2: Weight 6 kg, Value $30\nItem 3: Weight 3 kg, Value $15\nItem 4: Weight 5 kg, Value $25\nItem 5: Weight 2 kg, Value $10\n\nWhat combination of items should the student choose to maximize the total value while staying within the weight limit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total value while staying within the weight limit, we can try different combinations of items and calculate their total value and weight. We need to find the combination with the highest value that doesn't exceed the weight limit of 15 kg and has no more than 4 items.\n\nHere are some possible combinations:\n\n1. Items 1, 3, and 5: Total weight = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 kg, Total value = $20 + $15 + $10 = $45\n2. Items 1, 2, and 3: Total weight = 4 + 6 + 3 = 13 kg, Total value = $20 + $30 + $15 = $65\n3. Items 1, 4, and 5: Total weight = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 kg, Total value = $20 + $25 + $10 = $55\n4. Items 2, 3, and 5: Total weight = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 kg, Total value = $30 + $15 + $10 = $55\n5. Items 1, 2, and 4: Total weight = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15 kg, Total value = $20 + $30 + $25 = $75\n\nThe combination with the highest value that doesn't exceed the weight limit is items 1, 2, and 4, with a total weight of 15 kg and a total value of $75. The student should choose this combination to maximize the total value while staying within the weight limit."
