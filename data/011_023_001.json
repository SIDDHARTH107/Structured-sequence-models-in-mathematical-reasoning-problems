    "message_1": "Suppose there are 8 classrooms in a school and the principal wants to assign one of three colors - red, blue, or green - to each classroom. Each color can be assigned to any number of classrooms. In how many ways can the principal assign colors to the classrooms such that no two adjacent classrooms have the same color?",
    "message_2": "Let's use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let dp[i][j] be the number of ways to color the first i classrooms such that the i-th classroom has color j. We have three colors, so j can be 0 (red), 1 (blue), or 2 (green). The base case is when i = 1, and we have dp[1][0] = dp[1][1] = dp[1][2] = 1, as there is only one way to color the first classroom with each color.\n\nNow, let's consider the transition from the i-th classroom to the (i+1)-th classroom. If the i-th classroom has color j, then the (i+1)-th classroom can have any color except j. Therefore, we have the following recurrence relation:\n\ndp[i+1][k] = dp[i][(k+1) % 3] + dp[i][(k+2) % 3], for k = 0, 1, 2.\n\nWe can compute the dp table iteratively for i = 1, 2, ..., 8. Finally, the answer is the sum of the number of ways to color the 8 classrooms with each color, which is dp[8][0] + dp[8][1] + dp[8][2].\n\nHere's the code to compute the answer:\n\n```python\ndp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(9)]\ndp[1][0] = dp[1][1] = dp[1][2] = 1\n\nfor i in range(1, 8):\n    for j in range(3):\n        dp[i+1][j] = dp[i][(j+1) % 3] + dp[i][(j+2) % 3]\n\nanswer = dp[8][0] + dp[8][1] + dp[8][2]\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nThe output is 366, so there are 366 ways for the principal to assign colors to the classrooms such that no two adjacent classrooms have the same color."
