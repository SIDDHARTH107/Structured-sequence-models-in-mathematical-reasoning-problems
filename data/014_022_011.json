    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"HAPPYBIRTHDAY\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the keyword.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the keyword: MATH\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J) in order: MATHBCDEFGIKLOPQRSUVWXYZ\n\nNow, the Playfair matrix looks like this:\n\nM A T H B\nC D E F G\nI K L O P\nQ R S U V\nW X Y Z\n\nNext, we need to divide the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the plaintext has an odd number of characters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\nHAPPYBIRTHDAY -> HA PP YB IR TH DA YX\n\nNow, we apply the Playfair cipher rules to each digraph:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if needed).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if needed).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nHA -> BM\nPP -> KU\nYB -> EY\nIR -> TS\nTH -> AT\nDA -> CG\nYX -> YI\n\nThe resulting ciphertext is: BMKUEYTSATCGYI"
