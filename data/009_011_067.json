If the constant k is estimated to be 0.01 per day, what is the maximum number of infected individuals that can be reached before the disease starts to decline?\n\nNote: Assume that once an individual is infected, they cannot be re-infected or infect others again.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of infected individuals before the disease starts to decline, we need to find the point where the rate of change of infected individuals (dI/dt) is at its maximum. This occurs when the derivative of dI/dt with respect to I is equal to 0.\n\nLet's first write down the given differential equation:\n\ndI/dt = k * I * (N - I) / N\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of dI/dt with respect to I:\n\nd²I/dt² = d/dI (k * I * (N - I) / N)\n\nTo find this derivative, we can use the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nd²I/dt² = k/N * ( (N - I) * dI/dI - I * d(N - I)/dI )\nd²I/dt² = k/N * ( (N - I) - I * (-1) )\nd²I/dt² = k/N * (N - I + I)\n\nNow, we set the second derivative equal to 0 to find the maximum:\n\n0 = k/N * (N - I_max + I_max)\n0 = k/N * N\n\nSince k and N are both positive, the only way for this equation to be true is if I_max = N/2. Therefore, the maximum number of infected individuals before the disease starts to decline is half of the total population:\n\nI_max = N/2\nI_max = 100,000/2\nI_max = 50,000\n\nSo, the maximum number of infected individuals that can be reached before the disease starts to decline is 50,000."
