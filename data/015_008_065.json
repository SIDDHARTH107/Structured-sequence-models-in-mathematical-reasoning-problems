    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant α, also known as the Feigenbaum bifurcation constant, is a universal constant that appears in the study of chaotic systems, specifically in the period-doubling route to chaos. For the logistic map described by the function f(x) = 4x(1 - x), the Feigenbaum constant α is approximately 2.5029 to four decimal places."
