    "message_1": "A company needs to decide how many units of two products, A and B, to produce in order to maximize their profit. The production of product A requires 4 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time per unit and generates a profit of $20 per unit. The production of product B requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time per unit and generates a profit of $15 per unit. The labor available for the production is limited to 100 hours and the available machine time is 75 hours. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of products A and B that the company should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabor: 4x + 2y ≤ 100\nMachine time: 2x + 3y ≤ 75\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 20x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal number of units of products A and B, we need to solve this linear programming problem.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n4x + 2y ≤ 100 can be rewritten as y ≤ 50 - 2x\n2x + 3y ≤ 75 can be rewritten as y ≤ (75 - 2x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the intersection of these inequalities. Now, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = 50 - 2x and y = (75 - 2x) / 3:\n50 - 2x = (75 - 2x) / 3\n150 - 6x = 75 - 2x\n4x = 75\nx = 18.75, y = 12.5\n\n2. Intersection of y = 50 - 2x and x = 0:\ny = 50 - 2(0) = 50\nx = 0, y = 50\n\n3. Intersection of y = (75 - 2x) / 3 and x = 0:\ny = (75 - 2(0)) / 3 = 25\nx = 0, y = 25\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. Profit at (18.75, 12.5) = 20(18.75) + 15(12.5) = 375 + 187.5 = 562.5\n2. Profit at (0, 50) = 20(0) + 15(50) = 0 + 750 = 750\n3. Profit at (0, 25) = 20(0) + 15(25) = 0 + 375 = 375\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 50) with a profit of $750. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 50 units of product B to maximize their profit."
