    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profit per unit for A is $8 and for B is $10. To produce product A, it takes 4 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor time. To produce product B, it takes 3 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor time. The company has 200 hours of machine time available per week and 150 hours of labor time available per week. What should be the weekly production of each product in order to maximize the profit? Use the whale optimization algorithm to solve this optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. However, since I am an AI language model, I cannot directly implement the WOA. Instead, I will guide you through the process of solving this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A produced per week and y be the number of units of product B produced per week. The objective is to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 8x + 10y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 200 (machine time constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 150 (labor time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can graph the constraints and find the feasible region. Then, we can evaluate the profit function at each vertex of the feasible region to find the optimal solution.\n\n1. Graph the constraints:\n\n4x + 3y = 200 => y = (200 - 4x) / 3\n2x + 4y = 150 => y = (150 - 2x) / 4\n\n2. Find the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the area enclosed by the two lines and the axes.\n\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nThere are three vertices in the feasible region: (0, 0), (0, 50), and (30, 20).\n\n4. Evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = 0\nP(0, 50) = 8(0) + 10(50) = 500\nP(30, 20) = 8(30) + 10(20) = 240 + 200 = 440\n\n5. Determine the optimal solution:\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 50), with a profit of $500. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 50 units of product B per week to maximize its profit.\n\nNote that this solution was obtained using linear programming, not the whale optimization algorithm. To use the WOA, you would need to implement the algorithm in a programming language and apply it to this problem."
