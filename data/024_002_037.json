    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. Geodesics on the surface of a sphere are segments of great circles.\n\nGiven a sphere of radius 5 cm, we have the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nThe North Pole is at (0, 0, 5) and the endpoint is at (3, 4, 0). To find the great circle containing these two points, we need to find the plane that passes through the center of the sphere (0, 0, 0) and the two given points.\n\nLet's use the formula for the plane passing through three points, A(x1, y1, z1), B(x2, y2, z2), and C(x3, y3, z3):\n\n(x - x1)(y2 - y1)(z3 - z1) - (z - z1)(y2 - y1)(x3 - x1) = (x - x1)(z2 - z1)(y3 - y1) - (y - y1)(z2 - z1)(x3 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the points A(0, 0, 5), B(3, 4, 0), and C(0, 0, 0):\n\n(x - 0)(4 - 0)(0 - 5) - (z - 5)(4 - 0)(0 - 0) = (x - 0)(0 - 5)(0 - 0) - (y - 0)(0 - 5)(3 - 0)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get the equation of the plane:\n\n4x - 5y = 0\n\nNow we need to find the intersection of this plane with the sphere. Substituting the equation of the sphere into the plane equation:\n\n4x - 5y = 0\nx = (5/4)y\n\nNow substitute x into the sphere equation:\n\n((5/4)y)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nSolving for y and z, we get:\n\n(25/16)y^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n(41/16)y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nNow we can parameterize the intersection curve using spherical coordinates:\n\nx = 5sin(θ)cos(φ)\ny = 5sin(θ)sin(φ)\nz = 5cos(θ)\n\nWe know that x = (5/4)y, so:\n\n5sin(θ)cos(φ) = (5/4)(5sin(θ)sin(φ))\ncos(φ) = (5/4)sin(φ)\n\nNow we can find the angle φ:\n\ntan(φ) = 4/5\nφ = arctan(4/5)\n\nNow we can find the angle θ by plugging the endpoint (3, 4, 0) into the spherical coordinates:\n\n3 = 5sin(θ)cos(arctan(4/5))\n4 = 5sin(θ)sin(arctan(4/5))\n0 = 5cos(θ)\n\nFrom the last equation, we get θ = π/2.\n\nNow we have the parameterization of the geodesic:\n\nx(θ, φ) = 5sin(θ)cos(φ) = 5sin(π/2)cos(arctan(4/5)) = 3\ny(θ, φ) = 5sin(θ)sin(φ) = 5sin(π/2)sin(arctan(4/5)) = 4\nz(θ, φ) = 5cos(θ) = 5cos(π/2) = 0\n\nSo the geodesic on the surface of the sphere that starts at the North Pole (0, 0, 5) and ends at the point (3, 4, 0) is a segment of the great circle with the parameterization:\n\nx(θ, φ) = 5sin(θ)cos(arctan(4/5))\ny(θ, φ) = 5sin(θ)sin(arctan(4/5))\nz(θ, φ) = 5cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ varies from 0 to π/2."
