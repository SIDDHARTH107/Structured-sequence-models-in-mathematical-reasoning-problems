    "message_1": "A graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges. How many connected components does this graph have?",
    "message_2": "A connected graph with n vertices has at least n-1 edges and at most n(n-1)/2 edges. In this case, we have 5 vertices, so the minimum number of edges for a connected graph is 5-1=4 edges, and the maximum number of edges is 5(5-1)/2 = 10 edges.\n\nSince the graph has 7 edges, which is more than the minimum number of edges required for a connected graph with 5 vertices, it is possible that the graph is connected. Therefore, the graph can have 1 connected component."
