    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, the probability of a burglary occurring is 0.25, while the probability of a theft occurring is 0.55. What is the probability that either a burglary or a theft will occur in the neighborhood?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either a burglary or a theft occurring, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A represents the event of a burglary, B represents the event of a theft, and P(A ∩ B) represents the probability of both events occurring simultaneously.\n\nHowever, we don't have the information about the probability of both events occurring simultaneously. If we assume that the events are mutually exclusive (meaning they cannot occur at the same time), then P(A ∩ B) = 0, and the formula simplifies to:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)\n\nPlugging in the given probabilities:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(Burglary) + P(Theft) = 0.25 + 0.55 = 0.80\n\nSo, the probability that either a burglary or a theft will occur in the neighborhood is 0.80 or 80%."
