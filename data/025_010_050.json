    "message_1": "Let X be a non-singular projective curve of genus 2 over a field k. Suppose that there exists a divisor D on X such that the linear system |D| has dimension 1 and is base point free. Further, let L be the invertible sheaf associated to D. If h0(X, L) = 3 and h1(X, L) = 0, then what is deg(D)?",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of the divisor D, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on a curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K_X - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles bounded by D, K_X is the canonical divisor, and g is the genus of the curve.\n\nIn our case, we are given that l(D) = h0(X, L) = 3 and l(K_X - D) = h1(X, L) = 0. The genus of the curve X is g = 2.\n\nPlugging these values into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\n3 - 0 = deg(D) + 1 - 2.\n\nSolving for deg(D), we find that deg(D) = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4.\n\nSo, the degree of the divisor D is 4."
