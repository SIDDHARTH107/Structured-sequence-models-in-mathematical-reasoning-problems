    "message_2": "If both players play optimally, the first player will always win the game.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1. The first player removes two stones, leaving 13 stones in the pile.\n2. From this point on, the first player mirrors the second player's move. If the second player removes one stone, the first player also removes one stone. If the second player removes two stones, the first player removes two stones as well.\n\nBy following this strategy, the first player ensures that there are always an odd number of stones in the pile after their turn. Since there is an odd number of stones, the second player can never remove the last stone, and the first player will always win."
