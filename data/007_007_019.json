    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions of the equation 3x + 7y = 23, we can use the following method:\n\n1. Find one particular solution (x0, y0) of the equation.\n2. Use the general solution formula to find all other integer solutions.\n\nStep 1: Find one particular solution (x0, y0)\n\nWe can try different integer values for x and y to find a solution that satisfies the equation. Let's start with x = 1:\n\n3(1) + 7y = 23\n7y = 20\ny = 20/7\n\nSince y is not an integer, we can try x = 2:\n\n3(2) + 7y = 23\n6 + 7y = 23\n7y = 17\ny = 17/7\n\nAgain, y is not an integer. Let's try x = 3:\n\n3(3) + 7y = 23\n9 + 7y = 23\n7y = 14\ny = 2\n\nNow we have found a particular solution: (x0, y0) = (3, 2).\n\nStep 2: Use the general solution formula\n\nThe general solution formula for the Diophantine equation ax + by = c is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, d = gcd(a, b), and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 7, and c = 23. Since 3 and 7 are coprime (i.e., their gcd is 1), we have d = 1. Thus, the general solution formula becomes:\n\nx = 3 + 7n\ny = 2 - 3n\n\nNow we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for n:\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (3, 2) (this is our particular solution)\nn = 1: (x, y) = (10, -1)\nn = 2: (x, y) = (17, -4)\nn = -1: (x, y) = (-4, 5)\nn = -2: (x, y) = (-11, 8)\n\nAnd so on. The integer solutions of the equation 3x + 7y = 23 are given by:\n\n(x, y) = (3 + 7n, 2 - 3n) for any integer n."
