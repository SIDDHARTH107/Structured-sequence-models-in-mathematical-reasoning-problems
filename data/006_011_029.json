    "message_1": "The probability of an accident occurring in a factory is 0.25 during a given period of time. If the factory operates for 8 hours a day, what is the probability that an accident will occur during the first 2 hours of operation?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of an accident occurring during the first 2 hours of operation. Since the factory operates for 8 hours a day, we can divide the day into four equal periods of 2 hours each. \n\nAssuming the probability of an accident occurring is constant throughout the day, the probability of an accident occurring in any 2-hour period is the same. Therefore, the probability of an accident occurring during the first 2 hours of operation is also 0.25."
