    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection product of A and B is equal to the intersection product of B and A, we need to show that the intersection number of A and B is the same as the intersection number of B and A. Since A and B intersect transversely, their intersection number is well-defined and can be computed as the signed count of intersection points.\n\nLet p be a point in the intersection of A and B, i.e., p ∈ A ∩ B. Since A and B intersect transversely, the tangent spaces at p, T_pA and T_pB, span the tangent space of X at p, i.e., T_pX = T_pA + T_pB. Therefore, the orientation of T_pX is determined by the orientations of T_pA and T_pB. Since the orientation of T_pX is the same for both A and B, the sign of the intersection at p is the same for both A ∩ B and B ∩ A. Thus, the intersection product of A and B is equal to the intersection product of B and A.\n\nNow, let X = S^n, the n-dimensional sphere, and let A = S^{n-1} and B = S^{n-1} be two submanifolds of X. We want to find the intersection product of A and B using Poincaré duality.\n\nPoincaré duality states that the cohomology ring H^*(X) is isomorphic to the cohomology ring H^{n-*}(X) for a compact, oriented, smooth manifold X of dimension n. In our case, X = S^n, so we have H^*(S^n) ≅ H^{n-*}(S^n).\n\nThe cohomology ring of the n-sphere is given by H^k(S^n) = Z if k = 0 or k = n, and H^k(S^n) = 0 otherwise. Therefore, the Poincaré dual of A and B are both in H^{n-(n-1)}(S^n) = H^1(S^n), which is trivial since H^1(S^n) = 0.\n\nSince the Poincaré duals of A and B are both trivial, their intersection product is also trivial. Therefore, the intersection product of A and B in S^n is 0."
