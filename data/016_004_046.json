    "message_2": "The Koch curve is a fractal curve with a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1, specifically log(4)/log(3) ≈ 1.26186. Julia sets are fractals generated by iterating a complex quadratic polynomial, such as f(z) = z² + c, where c is a complex constant.\n\nHowever, there is no known value of \"c\" for which the corresponding Julia set of the function f(z) = z² + c has a Koch curve as its boundary. The Julia sets and the Koch curve are different types of fractals with distinct properties and structures. While it is an interesting question, it is not possible to provide a specific value of \"c\" that would result in a Julia set with a Koch curve as its boundary."
