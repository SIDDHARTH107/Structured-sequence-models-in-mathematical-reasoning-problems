    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To find the value of φ(96), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we can plug the prime factors into the formula:\n\nφ(96) = 96 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(96) = 96 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(96) = 48 * (2/3)\nφ(96) = 32\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function of 96 is 32."
