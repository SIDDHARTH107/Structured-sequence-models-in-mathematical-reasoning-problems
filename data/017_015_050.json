    "message_2": "To show that G cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C8 × C3, we will show that G cannot be a cyclic group of order 24.\n\nSuppose G is a cyclic group of order 24. Then G is generated by an element g of order 24. By the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G, which is 24. Thus, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nNow, let's consider the cyclic group C8 × C3. The order of this group is 8 × 3 = 24. The elements of this group are ordered pairs (a, b), where a is an element of C8 and b is an element of C3. The order of an element (a, b) in C8 × C3 is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b.\n\nThe possible orders of elements in C8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8, and the possible orders of elements in C3 are 1 and 3. Thus, the possible orders of elements in C8 × C3 are:\n\n- lcm(1, 1) = 1\n- lcm(1, 3) = 3\n- lcm(2, 1) = 2\n- lcm(2, 3) = 6\n- lcm(4, 1) = 4\n- lcm(4, 3) = 12\n- lcm(8, 1) = 8\n- lcm(8, 3) = 24\n\nWe can see that the possible orders of elements in C8 × C3 are the same as the possible orders of elements in G. However, this does not necessarily mean that G is isomorphic to C8 × C3.\n\nTo show that G cannot be isomorphic to C8 × C3, we will use the fact that a group is cyclic if and only if it has exactly one subgroup of each order that divides the order of the group.\n\nIn C8 × C3, there are exactly two subgroups of order 2:\n\n1. {(0, 0), (4, 0)} generated by (4, 0)\n2. {(0, 0), (0, 1)} generated by (0, 1)\n\nHowever, in a cyclic group of order 24, there must be exactly one subgroup of order 2. This is a contradiction, and thus G cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C8 × C3."
