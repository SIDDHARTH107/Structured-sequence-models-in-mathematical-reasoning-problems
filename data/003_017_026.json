    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) = 2sin(x), and the interval is [-π/4, π/4]. So, a = -π/4 and b = π/4.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/4 - (-π/4))) * ∫[-π/4, π/4] 2sin(x) dx\nAverage value = (1/(π/2)) * ∫[-π/4, π/4] 2sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 2sin(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫2sin(x) dx = -2cos(x) + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral on the interval [-π/4, π/4]:\n\n[-2cos(π/4) - (-2cos(-π/4))] = -2cos(π/4) + 2cos(π/4) = 2√2 - (-2√2) = 4√2\n\nNow, we'll plug this back into our average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2)) * 4√2\nAverage value = (2/π) * 4√2\nAverage value = 8√2/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) on the interval [-π/4, π/4] is 8√2/π."
