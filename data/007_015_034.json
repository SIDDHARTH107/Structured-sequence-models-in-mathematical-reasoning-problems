    "message_2": "We are given the equation 2^p - 1 = 31. To find the smallest possible value of p, we can first solve for p:\n\n2^p = 32\n\nNow, we can find the smallest integer value of p that satisfies this equation. Since 2^5 = 32, the smallest possible value of p is 5.\n\nHowever, we also need to check if the result (31) is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. The factors of 31 are 1 and 31, so 31 is indeed a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of p that gives a prime number as a result is p = 5."
