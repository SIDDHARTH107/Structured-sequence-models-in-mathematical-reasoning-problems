    "message_1": "A metal sheet measuring 20 inches by 30 inches has four identical squares removed from its corners. The sheet is then bent up along each of the resulting sides to form an open rectangular box. \n\nWhat should be the side length of each removed square to create a box with the maximum volume? \n\n(Note: The volume of a rectangular box with length L, width W, and height H is given by V = LWH)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of each removed square. After removing the squares, the dimensions of the resulting box will be:\n\nLength (L) = 30 - 2x\nWidth (W) = 20 - 2x\nHeight (H) = x\n\nThe volume of the box (V) can be expressed as:\n\nV = LWH = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)(x)\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the volume function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero.\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = d(4x^3 - 100x^2 + 600x)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation:\n\nV'(x) = 12x^2 - 200x + 600\n\nNow, set V'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 12x^2 - 200x + 600\n\nDivide the equation by 4:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 50x + 150\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -50, and c = 150:\n\nx = (50 ± √((-50)^2 - 4(3)(150))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (50 ± √(2500 - 1800)) / 6\n\nx = (50 ± √700) / 6\n\nx ≈ 5.42 and x ≈ 9.25\n\nSince the width of the metal sheet is 20 inches, we cannot remove squares with a side length of 9.25 inches. Therefore, the side length of each removed square that maximizes the volume of the box is approximately 5.42 inches."
