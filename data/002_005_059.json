    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has dimensions of 12 cm in length, 8 cm in width, and 10 cm in height. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (d) can be found using the formula:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nIn this case, l = 12 cm, w = 8 cm, and h = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √(12² + 8² + 10²)\nd = √(144 + 64 + 100)\nd = √(308)\nd ≈ 17.54 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 17.54 cm."
