    "message_1": "Consider the 2-dimensional Morse-Smale complex of a smooth function $f(x,y)$ with critical points at $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, where the index of each critical point is as follows:\n\n- $(0,0)$ has index 1\n- $(1,1)$ has index 2\n- $(2,0)$ has index 1\n\nAssume that there are no other critical points. How many 1-dimensional cells are there in the complex?",
    "message_2": "In a Morse-Smale complex, the 1-dimensional cells are the gradient flow lines connecting critical points of consecutive indices. In this case, we have two critical points with index 1 ($(0,0)$ and $(2,0)$) and one critical point with index 2 ($(1,1)$).\n\nSince there are no other critical points, we can only connect the index 1 critical points to the index 2 critical point. Therefore, there are 2 gradient flow lines (1-dimensional cells) in the complex: one connecting $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$ and another connecting $(2,0)$ to $(1,1)$."
