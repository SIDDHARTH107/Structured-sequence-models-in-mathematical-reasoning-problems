    "message_1": "A cone has a diameter of 10 cm and a height of 7 cm. What is the surface area of the cone? (Use π=3.14)",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of the cone, we need to find the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base. The base is a circle with a diameter of 10 cm, so the radius is half of the diameter, which is 5 cm. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nA_base = π(5 cm)² = 3.14 × 25 cm² = 78.5 cm²\n\nNext, let's find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cone is given by the formula A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height. To find the slant height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, since the radius, height, and slant height form a right triangle:\n\ns² = r² + h²\ns² = (5 cm)² + (7 cm)² = 25 cm² + 49 cm² = 74 cm²\ns = √74 cm ≈ 8.6 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area:\n\nA_lateral = π(5 cm)(8.6 cm) = 3.14 × 43 cm² ≈ 135.02 cm²\n\nFinally, let's add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 78.5 cm² + 135.02 cm² ≈ 213.52 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is approximately 213.52 cm²."
