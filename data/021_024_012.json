    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, product A and product B. The profit for each unit of product A is $8 and the profit for each unit of product B is $10. The company has a production capacity of 2000 units per day. The production process of each product requires two resources that are limited to a total of 4000 units per day. Using the bat algorithm, determine the number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize the daily profit.",
    "message_2": "The bat algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats. However, this problem can be solved more efficiently using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 8x + 10y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production capacity: x + y <= 2000\n2. Resource limitation: 2x + 2y <= 4000\n\nFirst, we can simplify the resource limitation constraint:\nx + y <= 2000 (since both constraints are the same, we can focus on one)\n\nNow, we can find the corner points of the feasible region:\n1. (0, 0) - origin\n2. (2000, 0) - x-intercept\n3. (0, 2000) - y-intercept\n\nCalculate the profit for each corner point:\n1. P(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = $0\n2. P(2000, 0) = 8(2000) + 10(0) = $16,000\n3. P(0, 2000) = 8(0) + 10(2000) = $20,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (0, 2000), which means the company should produce 0 units of product A and 2000 units of product B to maximize the daily profit of $20,000."
