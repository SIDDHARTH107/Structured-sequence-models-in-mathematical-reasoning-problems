    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., they have no common divisors other than 1). To compute φ(n), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 30, we first find its prime factors: 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. Now we can apply the formula:\n\nφ(30) = 30 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(30) = 30 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5)\nφ(30) = 30 * (1/3) * (4/5)\nφ(30) = 30 * (4/15)\nφ(30) = 8\n\nSo, the value of φ(30) is 8."
