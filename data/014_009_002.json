    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform the actual encryption process for a Feistel cipher, as it requires a specific key and a predefined function for each round. However, I can provide you with a general understanding of how the Feistel cipher works.\n\nA Feistel cipher is a symmetric key block cipher that operates on fixed-size blocks of data. In this case, the block size is 64 bits, and the key size is 128 bits. The plaintext message you provided, \"1010010110111100\", is only 16 bits long, which is not enough to fill a 64-bit block. You would need to pad the plaintext message to make it 64 bits long before encrypting it.\n\nThe Feistel cipher consists of multiple rounds (in this case, 16 rounds). In each round, the data is divided into two halves, left and right. The right half is passed through a round function, which takes a round key (derived from the main key) as input. The output of the round function is then XORed with the left half. The two halves are then swapped for the next round.\n\nAfter all the rounds are completed, the final left and right halves are combined to form the ciphertext. Without the specific key and round function, it is not possible to provide the exact ciphertext for the given plaintext message."
