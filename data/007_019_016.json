    "message_2": "To use the Miller-Rabin primality test, we first need to write the given number 7919 as an odd number multiplied by a power of 2. In other words, we need to find integers n and k such that 7919 = 2^k * n, where n is odd.\n\n7919 - 1 = 7918\n7918 = 2 * 3959\n\nSo, we have 7919 = 2^1 * 3959.\n\nNow, we perform the Miller-Rabin test with base 2:\n\n1. Compute 2^n mod 7919:\n2^3959 mod 7919 = 1\n\nSince the result is 1, the Miller-Rabin test is inconclusive, and we cannot determine whether 7919 is prime or composite using the base 2.\n\nHowever, we can try another base to see if we can get a conclusive result. Let's try base 3:\n\n1. Compute 3^n mod 7919:\n3^3959 mod 7919 = 7918\n\nSince the result is 7919 - 1, the Miller-Rabin test is still inconclusive. We can try more bases, but it's worth noting that the Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic test, and it's possible that it will remain inconclusive for all bases.\n\nIn this case, it's better to use a deterministic primality test, such as the AKS primality test, to determine whether 7919 is prime or composite. However, it's worth noting that 7919 is indeed a prime number."
