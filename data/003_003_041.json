    "message_2": "To find the value of the tangent of 3π/4 radians using the unit circle method, we first need to determine the coordinates of the point on the unit circle that corresponds to this angle.\n\nRecall that the unit circle has a radius of 1, and the coordinates of a point on the unit circle can be represented as (cos(θ), sin(θ)), where θ is the angle in radians.\n\n3π/4 radians is equivalent to 135 degrees, which lies in the second quadrant of the unit circle. In the second quadrant, the x-coordinate (cosine) is negative, and the y-coordinate (sine) is positive.\n\nTo find the coordinates of the point, we can use the reference angle, which is the acute angle formed by the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis. In this case, the reference angle is π/4 (45 degrees).\n\nWe know that cos(π/4) = sin(π/4) = √2/2. Since the angle is in the second quadrant, the x-coordinate (cosine) will be negative. Therefore, the coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to 3π/4 radians are (-√2/2, √2/2).\n\nNow, we can find the tangent of the angle by taking the ratio of the sine to the cosine:\n\ntan(3π/4) = sin(3π/4) / cos(3π/4) = (√2/2) / (-√2/2) = -1\n\nSo, the value of the tangent of 3π/4 radians is -1."
