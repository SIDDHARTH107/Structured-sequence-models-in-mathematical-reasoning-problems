    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Euler's Totient Theorem, which is a generalization of Fermat's Little Theorem. Euler's Totient Theorem states that for any integer a and n, if they are relatively prime (i.e., gcd(a, n) = 1), then:\n\na^(φ(n)) ≡ 1 (mod n)\n\nwhere φ(n) is the Euler's totient function, which counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.\n\nFirst, we need to find φ(54). Since 54 = 2 * 3^3, we can use the property of the Euler's totient function for a product of distinct prime powers:\n\nφ(54) = φ(2) * φ(3^3)\n\nFor a prime power p^k, we have:\n\nφ(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1)\n\nSo, φ(2) = 2 - 1 = 1 and φ(3^3) = 3^3 - 3^2 = 27 - 9 = 18.\n\nTherefore, φ(54) = 1 * 18 = 18.\n\nNow, we can apply Euler's Totient Theorem:\n\n7^18 ≡ 1 (mod 54)\n\nWe want to find the remainder when 7^53 is divided by 54. We can rewrite 7^53 as:\n\n7^53 = (7^18)^(2) * 7^17\n\nSince 7^18 ≡ 1 (mod 54), we have:\n\n(7^18)^(2) * 7^17 ≡ 1^2 * 7^17 (mod 54)\n7^53 ≡ 7^17 (mod 54)\n\nNow, we can use exponentiation by squaring to find the remainder of 7^17 (mod 54):\n\n7^2 = 49 ≡ -5 (mod 54)\n7^4 = (-5)^2 = 25 ≡ 25 (mod 54)\n7^8 = 25^2 = 625 ≡ 7 (mod 54)\n7^16 = 7^2 = 49 ≡ -5 (mod 54)\n\nNow, we can multiply the results:\n\n7^17 ≡ 7^16 * 7 ≡ -5 * 7 ≡ -35 ≡ 19 (mod 54)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^53 is divided by 54 is 19."
