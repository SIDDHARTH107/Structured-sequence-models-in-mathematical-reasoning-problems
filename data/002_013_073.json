    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 6 cm, width of 4 cm, and height of 9 cm. Calculate its volume.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Length * Width * Height\n\nGiven the dimensions of the pyramid, we have:\n\nLength = 6 cm\nWidth = 4 cm\nHeight = 9 cm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 * 4 * 9\nVolume = (1/3) * 216\nVolume = 72 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 72 cubic centimeters."
