    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a cylinder, we need to find the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)² + 2π(5)(12)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(25) + 2π(60)\n\nSurface Area = 50π + 120π\n\nSurface Area = 170π\n\nNow, we can approximate π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 170 * 3.14\n\nSurface Area ≈ 534.2 square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 534.2 square centimeters."
