    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can add both equations together to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(x + y) + (2x - y) = 5 + 1\nx + y + 2x - y = 6\n3x = 6\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x = 6\nx = 6 / 3\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\nx + y = 5\n2 + y = 5\ny = 5 - 2\ny = 3\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 2 and y = 3."
