    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. After each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a constant factor, which is √2 for the Lévy C curve.\n\nTo find the length of the curve after the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength after n iterations = Initial length * (√2)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and n = 6.\n\nLength after 6 iterations = 1 * (√2)^6\nLength after 6 iterations = 1 * (2^3)\nLength after 6 iterations = 1 * 8\nLength after 6 iterations = 8 units\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after the 6th iteration is 8 units."
