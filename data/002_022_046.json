    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 8 centimeters and a minor radius of 3 centimeters. What is the volume of the torus? (Round the answer to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 8 cm and r = 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 8 * 3^3\n\nVolume = 2 * (3.14159)^2 * 8 * 27\n\nVolume = 2 * 9.8696 * 8 * 27\n\nVolume = 19.7392 * 216\n\nVolume ≈ 4262.41 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 4262.41 cubic centimeters, rounded to two decimal places."
