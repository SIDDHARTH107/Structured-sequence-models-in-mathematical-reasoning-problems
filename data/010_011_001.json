    "message_2": "The classification theorem of orientable surfaces states that any smooth orientable compact surface can be obtained by taking a sphere and attaching g handles to it, where g is the genus of the surface. The Euler characteristic of a surface is given by the formula:\n\nχ(M) = V - E + F\n\nwhere V, E, and F are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the surface, respectively.\n\nFor a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2 (since V = 0, E = 0, and F = 1). When we attach a handle to the sphere, we are essentially adding a torus to the surface. The Euler characteristic of a torus is 0 (since V = 0, E = 0, and F = 1). \n\nNow, let's consider the effect of attaching g handles to the sphere. Each handle we attach reduces the Euler characteristic by 2 (since we are adding a torus with χ = 0). Therefore, for a surface of genus g, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2g\n\nIn our case, the genus of the surface M is 3. So, we can find the Euler characteristic of M as follows:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic of the smooth orientable compact surface M of genus 3 is -4."
