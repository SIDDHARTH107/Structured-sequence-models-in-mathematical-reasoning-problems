    "message_1": "A set S contains 6 elements. Set T contains 3 elements. How many elements are in the union of sets S and T?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in the union of sets S and T, we need to know if there are any overlapping or common elements between the two sets. If there are no common elements, then the union will simply be the sum of the elements in both sets.\n\nAssuming there are no common elements, the union of sets S and T will have 6 + 3 = 9 elements. However, if there are common elements, the number of elements in the union will be less than 9."
