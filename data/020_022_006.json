    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $50,000 to be allocated towards three different advertising channels: TV, radio, and social media. The cost per ad for each channel is $500 for TV, $250 for radio, and $100 for social media. The company wants to maximize the total number of impressions among the three channels. TV ads generate 500 impressions, radio ads generate 300 impressions, and social media ads generate 1000 impressions. Formulate the problem as an optimization model to determine how many ads of each type the company should buy to maximize the total number of impressions within the budget limit.",
    "message_2": "Let x1, x2, and x3 represent the number of TV, radio, and social media ads, respectively. We want to maximize the total number of impressions, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nObjective function: Maximize Z = 500x1 + 300x2 + 1000x3\n\nSubject to the budget constraint:\n\n500x1 + 250x2 + 100x3 <= 50,000\n\nAnd the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx1 >= 0\nx2 >= 0\nx3 >= 0\n\nSo, the optimization model is:\n\nMaximize Z = 500x1 + 300x2 + 1000x3\nSubject to:\n500x1 + 250x2 + 100x3 <= 50,000\nx1 >= 0\nx2 >= 0\nx3 >= 0"
