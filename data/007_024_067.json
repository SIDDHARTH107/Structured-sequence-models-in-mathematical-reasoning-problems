    "message_2": "To solve the discrete logarithm problem 23^x ≡ 8 (mod 29), we can use the baby-step giant-step algorithm. \n\n1. Calculate m = ceil(sqrt(29-1)) = ceil(sqrt(28)) = 6\n2. Create a list of baby steps: (23^j) % 29 for j in [0, 1, ..., m-1]\n   Baby steps: [1, 23, 25, 16, 6, 4]\n3. Calculate the inverse of 23^m (mod 29): (23^6)^(-1) % 29 = 2\n4. Create a list of giant steps: (8 * (23^m)^i) % 29 for i in [0, 1, ..., m-1]\n   Giant steps: [8, 16, 9, 18, 27, 7]\n5. Find a common element in both lists:\n   Common element: 16\n6. Let the indices of the common element in the baby steps and giant steps lists be j and i, respectively:\n   j = 3, i = 1\n7. Calculate x = j + i * m = 3 + 1 * 6 = 9\n\nSo, x = 9 is the solution to the discrete logarithm problem 23^x ≡ 8 (mod 29)."
