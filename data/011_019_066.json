    "message_1": "A car manufacturing plant wants to test different combinations of four car parts to determine the best combination for improving fuel efficiency. The plant decides to use an orthogonal array to reduce the number of tests required. They have chosen an L12 orthogonal array. How many tests will be required to evaluate all of the 12 rows in the array?",
    "message_2": "An L12 orthogonal array requires 12 tests to evaluate all the 12 rows in the array. Each row represents a unique combination of the factors being tested, and the orthogonal array is designed to provide a balanced and efficient way to test these combinations. So, the car manufacturing plant will need to conduct 12 tests to evaluate all the combinations in the L12 orthogonal array."
