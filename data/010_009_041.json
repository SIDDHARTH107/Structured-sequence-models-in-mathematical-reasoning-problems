    "message_2": "To create a triangulation of the given triangle with six smaller triangles, we need to add extra vertices inside the triangle. Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to divide the given triangle into two smaller triangles. To do this, we can add a vertex inside the triangle and connect it to all three vertices of the given triangle. This will create three new triangles. Let's call this new vertex A.\n\n2. Now, we need to divide each of the three new triangles into two smaller triangles. To do this, we can add a new vertex inside each of the three new triangles and connect it to the vertices of the corresponding triangle. Let's call these new vertices B, C, and D.\n\n3. At this point, we have six smaller triangles, and each side of the original triangle is a boundary of exactly two triangles. The total number of vertices used is 4 (the original triangle vertices) + 4 (the new vertices A, B, C, and D) = 8.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices needed for such a triangulation is 8."
