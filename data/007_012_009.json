    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a natural number p greater than 1, (p-1)! + 1 is a prime number if and only if p is prime.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer n greater than 1 such that (n-1)! + 1 is not a prime number, we need to find the smallest composite number n. The smallest composite number is 4.\n\nNow, let's check if (4-1)! + 1 is a prime number:\n\n(3)! + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n7 is a prime number, so we need to move to the next smallest composite number, which is 6.\n\nNow, let's check if (6-1)! + 1 is a prime number:\n\n(5)! + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n\n121 is not a prime number (it is divisible by 11), so the smallest positive integer n greater than 1 such that (n-1)! + 1 is not a prime number is 6."
