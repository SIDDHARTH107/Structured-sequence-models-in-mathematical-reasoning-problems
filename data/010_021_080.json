Let $f:M\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function on $M$ such that $\\{f,H\\}=X_H(f)$ is a constant function. If $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to M$ is the integral curve of $X_H$ starting at $p\\in M$, i.e., $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}(t)=X_H(\\gamma(t))$ for all $t\\in[0,1]$, then prove that $f(\\gamma(1))-f(\\gamma(0))=\\{f,H\\}$.\n\nFor $(M,\\omega)$ being a symplectic manifold and $X_H$ being a Hamiltonian vector field with Hamiltonian function $H$, the bracket $\\{f,H\\}$ is the Poisson bracket of $f$ and $H$. This problem asks to show that the Poisson bracket is constant along the integral curves of $X_H$.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $f(\\gamma(1))-f(\\gamma(0))=\\{f,H\\}$, we will first compute the derivative of $f$ along the integral curve $\\gamma$ of $X_H$. Since $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}(t)=X_H(\\gamma(t))$, we have\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}f(\\gamma(t)) = X_H(f)(\\gamma(t)).$$\n\nNow, we are given that $\\{f,H\\}=X_H(f)$ is a constant function. Let $c$ be the constant value of this function, i.e., $\\{f,H\\}=c$. Then, we have\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}f(\\gamma(t)) = c.$$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$ over the interval $[0,1]$, we get\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{d}{dt}f(\\gamma(t))\\,dt = \\int_0^1 c\\,dt.$$\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the left-hand side becomes\n\n$$f(\\gamma(1))-f(\\gamma(0)).$$\n\nThe right-hand side becomes\n\n$$c(1-0)=c.$$\n\nThus, we have\n\n$$f(\\gamma(1))-f(\\gamma(0))=c=\\{f,H\\},$$\n\nwhich completes the proof."
