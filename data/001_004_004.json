    "message_1": "If the polynomial `2x^3 + 4x^2 + 2x` can be factored as `2x(x+1)(x+2)`, what is the factored form of the polynomial `x^4 - x^2 - 6x`?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the common factor in the given polynomial `x^4 - x^2 - 6x`. We can see that x is the common factor. So, we can factor out x from the polynomial:\n\n`x(x^3 - x - 6)`\n\nNow, we need to factor the cubic polynomial `x^3 - x - 6`. To do this, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nBy testing these possible roots, we find that x = 2 is a root, since:\n\n(2)^3 - (2) - 6 = 8 - 2 - 6 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n  2 |  1   0  -1  -6\n      |      2   4  10\n      ----------------\n        1   2   3   4\n```\n\nSo, the remaining quadratic factor is `x^2 + 2x + 3`.\n\nTherefore, the factored form of the polynomial `x^4 - x^2 - 6x` is:\n\n`x(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 3)`"
