    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the moduli space M₃ of stable algebraic curves of genus three, we can use the formula for the dimension of the moduli space of curves of genus g:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3\n\nIn our case, g = 3, so we have:\n\ndim(M₃) = 3(3) - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the moduli space M₃ of stable algebraic curves of genus three is 6."
