    "message_2": "To prove that there exist infinitely many prime numbers using higher-order logic, we will use a proof by contradiction. We will assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers and show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that there are only finitely many prime numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_n. Now, consider the number Q = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n + 1. \n\nWe will now show that Q is not divisible by any of the prime numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n. \n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that Q is divisible by some prime number p_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Then, we have:\n\nQ = p_i * k for some integer k.\n\nHowever, we also have:\n\nQ = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n + 1.\n\nThus, we can write:\n\np_i * k = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n + 1.\n\nNow, let's subtract 1 from both sides:\n\np_i * k - 1 = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.\n\nThis implies that p_i divides the left-hand side of the equation, but we know that p_i also divides the right-hand side of the equation (since it is a product of all prime numbers). This is a contradiction because p_i cannot divide both sides of the equation and their difference (which is 1).\n\nTherefore, our assumption that Q is divisible by some prime number p_i is false. This means that Q is either a prime number itself or has a prime factor that is not in our list of prime numbers (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n).\n\nIn either case, we have found a prime number that is not in our original list of finitely many prime numbers, which contradicts our initial assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers.\n\nHence, there must exist infinitely many prime numbers."
