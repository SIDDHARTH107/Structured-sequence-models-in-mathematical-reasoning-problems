    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\n[1 -1 2] [x]   [ 4]\n[2  1 3] [y] = [10]\n[3  4 -1] [z]   [-1]\n\nNow, we will find the inverse of matrix A and then multiply it with matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nMatrix A:\n[1 -1 2]\n[2  1 3]\n[3  4 -1]\n\nTo find the inverse of matrix A, we will first find its determinant.\n\nDeterminant of A (|A|) = 1(1(-1) - 3(4)) - (-1)(2(-1) - 3(4)) + 2(2(4) - 1(3))\n|A| = 1(-1 - 12) - (-1)(-2 - 12) + 2(8 - 3)\n|A| = 1(-13) - (-1)(-14) + 2(5)\n|A| = -13 - 14 + 10\n|A| = -17\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, we will find the adjoint of matrix A and then divide it by the determinant to get the inverse.\n\nAdjoint of A:\n[(-1 - 12)  -(2 - 6)  (2 - 3)] = [(-13)  4  (-1)]\n[(3 - 8)  -(3 - 6)  (6 - 9)]   = [(-5)  3  (-3)]\n[(4 - 3)  -(8 - 2)  (1 - 6)]   = [(1)   6  (-5)]\n\nNow, we will find the inverse of A by dividing the adjoint of A by the determinant of A.\n\nA^(-1) = (1/|A|) * adjoint(A)\nA^(-1) = (1/-17) * [(-13)  4  (-1)]\n                    [(-5)   3  (-3)]\n                    [(1)    6  (-5)]\n\nNow, we will multiply the inverse of A with matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\nX = (1/-17) * [(-13)  4  (-1)] [ 4]\n                    [(-5)   3  (-3)] [10]\n                    [(1)    6  (-5)] [-1]\n\nX = [((-13)(4) + 4(10) - 1(-1)) / -17]\n       [((-5)(4) + 3(10) - 3(-1)) / -17]\n       [(1(4) + 6(10) - 5(-1)) / -17]\n\nX = [(-52 + 40 + 1) / -17]\n       [(-20 + 30 + 3) / -17]\n       [(4 + 60 + 5) / -17]\n\nX = [(-11) / -17]\n       [(13) / -17]\n       [(69) / -17]\n\nX = [11/17]\n       [-13/17]\n       [-69/17]\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 11/17, y = -13/17, and z = -69/17."
