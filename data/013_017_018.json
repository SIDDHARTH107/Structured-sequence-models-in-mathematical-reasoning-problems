    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 used cars for sale, 30 of which are lemons and 70 of which are in good condition. A buyer has a value of $10,000 for a good car and $2,000 for a lemon. A seller knows whether a particular car is a lemon or in good condition but the buyer cannot distinguish between the two types. If the price of a good car is $8,000 and the price of a lemon is $4,000, what is the probability that a buyer will purchase a good car?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a buyer will purchase a good car, we need to determine the proportion of good cars among the total cars for sale.\n\nThere are 70 good cars and 30 lemons, making a total of 100 cars. The probability of a buyer purchasing a good car is the number of good cars divided by the total number of cars:\n\nProbability = (Number of good cars) / (Total number of cars)\nProbability = 70 / 100\nProbability = 0.7 or 70%\n\nSo, the probability that a buyer will purchase a good car is 70%."
