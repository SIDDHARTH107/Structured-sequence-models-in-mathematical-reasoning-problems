    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem related to Using the Fourier transform to solve differential equations for a math student to solve:\n\nA vibrating string is modeled by the partial differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = 9 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the displacement of the string from equilibrium at position $x$ and time $t$. Suppose the initial displacement of the string is given by the function $u(x, 0) = \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi x}{3} \\right)$ and the initial velocity is zero, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$. Use the Fourier transform to find the displacement of the string at time $t=1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first take the Fourier transform of the given partial differential equation (PDE) with respect to x. Let's denote the Fourier transform of u(x, t) as U(k, t), where k is the wave number. Then, the Fourier transform of the PDE is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial t^2} = -9k^2 U\n$$\n\nThis is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. The general solution of this ODE is:\n\n$$\nU(k, t) = A(k) \\cos(3kt) + B(k) \\sin(3kt)\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the initial conditions in the Fourier domain. Taking the Fourier transform of the initial displacement u(x, 0), we get:\n\n$$\nU(k, 0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi x}{3} \\right) e^{-ikx} dx\n$$\n\nSince the sine function is odd and the exponential function is even, their product is odd. Therefore, the integral is zero. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\nA(k) = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of the initial velocity:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t}(k, 0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\cdot e^{-ikx} dx = 0\n$$\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, we have:\n\n$$\nB(k) = 0\n$$\n\nThus, the solution in the Fourier domain is:\n\n$$\nU(k, t) = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we need to take the inverse Fourier transform to find the displacement u(x, t):\n\n$$\nu(x, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\cdot e^{ikx} dk = 0\n$$\n\nSo, the displacement of the string at time t = 1 is:\n\n$$\nu(x, 1) = 0\n$$"
