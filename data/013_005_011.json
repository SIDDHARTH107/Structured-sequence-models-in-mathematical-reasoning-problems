The payoff matrix for this game is given below:\n\n|      | Player 2 swerves | Player 2 doesn't swerve |\n|------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Player 1 swerves**    | (2,2)            | (0,3)                  |\n| **Player 1 doesn't swerve** | (3,0)            | (1,1)                  |\n\nSuppose Player 1 has a 70% chance of swerving and Player 2 has a 60% chance of swerving. What is the expected payoff for each player?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected payoff for each player, we need to calculate the probability of each outcome and then multiply it by the corresponding payoff. Then, we sum up the payoffs for each player.\n\n1. Player 1 swerves (70% chance) and Player 2 swerves (60% chance): \nProbability: 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42\nPayoff: (2,2)\n\n2. Player 1 swerves (70% chance) and Player 2 doesn't swerve (40% chance): \nProbability: 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28\nPayoff: (0,3)\n\n3. Player 1 doesn't swerve (30% chance) and Player 2 swerves (60% chance): \nProbability: 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18\nPayoff: (3,0)\n\n4. Player 1 doesn't swerve (30% chance) and Player 2 doesn't swerve (40% chance): \nProbability: 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12\nPayoff: (1,1)\n\nNow, we calculate the expected payoffs for each player:\n\nExpected payoff for Player 1:\n(0.42 * 2) + (0.28 * 0) + (0.18 * 3) + (0.12 * 1) = 0.84 + 0 + 0.54 + 0.12 = 1.5\n\nExpected payoff for Player 2:\n(0.42 * 2) + (0.28 * 3) + (0.18 * 0) + (0.12 * 1) = 0.84 + 0.84 + 0 + 0.12 = 1.8\n\nSo, the expected payoff for Player 1 is 1.5 and for Player 2 is 1.8."
