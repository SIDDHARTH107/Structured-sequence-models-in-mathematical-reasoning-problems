    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 5 cm and one leg is 3 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this problem, we are given the length of the hypotenuse (c) as 5 cm and the length of one leg (a) as 3 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b). Plugging the given values into the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\n5^2 = 3^2 + b^2\n25 = 9 + b^2\n25 - 9 = b^2\n16 = b^2\n\nNow, we can find the length of the other leg (b) by taking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš16\nb = 4\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 4 cm."
