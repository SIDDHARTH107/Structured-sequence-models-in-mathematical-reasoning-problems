In other words, it is the smallest number of edges that, when removed, will result in the graph becoming disconnected or trivial (consisting of only one vertex).\n\nTo determine the edge connectivity of a graph G with 10 vertices and 20 edges, we can use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: For any graph G, the edge connectivity λ(G) is equal to the minimum degree of the graph, i.e., λ(G) = min{deg(v) | v ∈ V(G)}.\n\nProof: Let G be a graph with n vertices and m edges. Let v be a vertex of minimum degree in G, and let deg(v) = k. Then, removing all k edges incident to v will disconnect v from the rest of the graph. Hence, λ(G) ≤ k.\n\nNow, consider any set of k edges in G. Since v has degree k, there must be at least one vertex w such that no edge in the set connects v and w. Therefore, removing the k edges will not disconnect v and w, and the graph remains connected. Hence, λ(G) ≥ k.\n\nCombining the inequalities, we have λ(G) = k.\n\nNow, let's apply this theorem to our graph G with 10 vertices and 20 edges. The average degree of the graph is given by:\n\n(2 * number of edges) / number of vertices = (2 * 20) / 10 = 4\n\nSince the graph is not regular (all vertices do not have the same degree), there must be at least one vertex with a degree less than or equal to the average degree. Therefore, the minimum degree of the graph is less than or equal to 4.\n\nHence, the edge connectivity of the graph G is λ(G) ≤ 4. To determine the exact value, we would need more information about the specific structure of the graph."
