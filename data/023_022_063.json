    "message_2": "To calculate the annualized volatility of the stock, we first need to find the instantaneous rate of return, which is the derivative of the natural logarithm of the price function with respect to time. \n\nLet's first find the derivative of the price function, $f'(t)$:\n\n$f'(t) = -40\\pi\\sin(2\\pi t) + 20\\pi\\cos(4\\pi t)$\n\nNow, let's find the instantaneous rate of return, which is the derivative of the natural logarithm of the price function:\n\n$R(t) = \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}$\n\n$R(t) = \\frac{-40\\pi\\sin(2\\pi t) + 20\\pi\\cos(4\\pi t)}{20\\cos(2\\pi t) + 5\\sin(4\\pi t)}$\n\nTo find the annualized volatility, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the instantaneous rate of return over a year. Since we don't have a closed-form expression for the standard deviation, we can approximate it by calculating the average of the squared instantaneous rate of return over a year and then taking the square root of the result.\n\nLet's denote the annualized volatility as $\\sigma$. Then,\n\n$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{t=1}^{12} R(t)^2}$\n\nSince we don't have a closed-form expression for $R(t)$, we can use numerical methods to approximate the sum of the squared instantaneous rate of return over a year and then calculate the annualized volatility."
