    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset with 10 variables and you want to perform factor analysis. After analyzing the data, you found that the first two factors explain 60% of the total variance. What is the total proportion of variance explained by all the factors combined?",
    "message_2": "In factor analysis, the total proportion of variance explained by all the factors combined is equal to 100%. This is because factor analysis aims to represent the original variables in terms of a smaller number of factors, which together account for all the variance in the dataset. So, even though the first two factors explain 60% of the total variance, the remaining factors (in this case, 8 more factors) will account for the remaining 40% of the variance, making the total proportion of variance explained by all the factors combined equal to 100%."
