    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z^2}$ defined in the open upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\text{Im}(z) > 0 \\}$. Let $S$ be the boundary of $\\mathbb{H}$ together with the real axis. Use the Schwarz reflection principle to find the analytic continuation of $f$ to the closed upper half plane $\\overline{\\mathbb{H}} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\text{Im}(z) \\geq 0 \\}$.\n\nHint: Start by reflecting $f$ across the real axis, and then use the properties of the reflection map to extend it to the lower half-plane. Then apply the Schwarz reflection principle to obtain the analytic continuation of $f$ to $\\overline{\\mathbb{H}}$.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find the reflection of the function $f(z)$ across the real axis. Let $g(z) = f(\\overline{z})$, where $\\overline{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z$. Then,\n\n$$g(z) = f(\\overline{z}) = \\frac{1}{1+\\overline{z}^2}.$$\n\nNow, we want to extend $f(z)$ to the lower half-plane. To do this, we define a new function $h(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$h(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) > 0 \\\\\ng(z) & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}.$$\n\nWe need to show that $h(z)$ is analytic in the closed upper half-plane $\\overline{\\mathbb{H}}$. We know that $f(z)$ is analytic in the open upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$, and $g(z)$ is analytic in the open lower half-plane. So, we only need to check the analyticity of $h(z)$ on the real axis.\n\nLet $z_0$ be a point on the real axis. We know that $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are continuous functions, so $h(z)$ is continuous at $z_0$. Now, we need to show that $h(z)$ is differentiable at $z_0$. To do this, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Since $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x},$$\n\nwhere $u$ and $v$ are the real and imaginary parts of $f(z)$ and $g(z)$, respectively. Since these equations hold for both $f(z)$ and $g(z)$, they also hold for $h(z)$ on the real axis. Therefore, $h(z)$ is differentiable at $z_0$, and hence, $h(z)$ is analytic in the closed upper half-plane $\\overline{\\mathbb{H}}$.\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the closed upper half-plane $\\overline{\\mathbb{H}}$ is given by the function $h(z)$."
