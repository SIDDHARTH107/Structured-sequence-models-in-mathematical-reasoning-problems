    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"HELLO\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: HELLO -> HEL O\n2. Fill the remaining spaces in the matrix with the rest of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher): HEL O -> HEL O + ABCDFGIKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n\nH E L O A\nB C D F G\nI K M N P\nQ R S T U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\":\n\n1. Break the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them: MA TH EM AT IC SX\n2. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if needed).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if needed).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\nMA -> PF\nTH -> YD\nEM -> KN\nAT -> TO\nIC -> FN\nSX -> UV\n\nThe encrypted message is: PFYDKNTOFNUV"
