    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem on Moral Hazard in Game Theory for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose a principal hires an agent to complete a project. The project's success depends on the agent's effort. The principal can offer the agent a high or low wage to motivate the agent to put in high effort or low effort, respectively. The outcome for each effort level is as follows: \n\n- High effort by the agent leads to a success with probability 0.6, earning the principal a reward of $100.\n- Low effort by the agent leads to success with probability 0.2, earning the principal a reward of $30.\n\nHowever, the agent's private cost of effort is $40. That is, it costs the agent $40 to put in high effort.\n\nWhat wage should the principal offer to maximize their expected payoff given this moral hazard situation?\n\n(Note: Assume the agent will choose effort level based on the wage offered and their private cost of effort.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal wage, we need to consider the expected payoffs for the principal under both high and low effort scenarios. We will denote the high wage as W_high and the low wage as W_low.\n\n1. High effort scenario:\nThe agent's expected payoff is 0.6 * W_high - $40 (the cost of high effort). The principal's expected payoff is 0.6 * $100 - W_high.\n\n2. Low effort scenario:\nThe agent's expected payoff is 0.2 * W_low. The principal's expected payoff is 0.2 * $30 - W_low.\n\nThe agent will choose high effort if their expected payoff from high effort is greater than or equal to their expected payoff from low effort. Therefore, we have the following inequality:\n\n0.6 * W_high - $40 >= 0.2 * W_low\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal wage combination that maximizes the principal's expected payoff while satisfying the agent's incentive constraint.\n\nFor the high effort scenario, the principal's expected payoff is:\n\n0.6 * $100 - W_high = $60 - W_high\n\nFor the low effort scenario, the principal's expected payoff is:\n\n0.2 * $30 - W_low = $6 - W_low\n\nTo maximize the principal's expected payoff, we want to choose the highest possible W_high and the lowest possible W_low that satisfy the agent's incentive constraint. Rearranging the inequality, we get:\n\nW_high >= (2/3) * W_low + (20/3)\n\nSince we want the highest possible W_high and the lowest possible W_low, we can set W_high = (2/3) * W_low + (20/3). Now, we need to compare the principal's expected payoffs under both scenarios.\n\nHigh effort scenario:\n\nExpected payoff = $60 - ((2/3) * W_low + (20/3))\n\nLow effort scenario:\n\nExpected payoff = $6 - W_low\n\nTo maximize the principal's expected payoff, we need to find the lowest W_low that makes the high effort scenario more attractive. Setting the expected payoffs equal to each other, we get:\n\n$60 - ((2/3) * W_low + (20/3)) = $6 - W_low\n\nSolving for W_low, we get:\n\nW_low = $18\n\nNow, we can find the optimal W_high using the relationship we derived earlier:\n\nW_high = (2/3) * $18 + (20/3) = $32\n\nTherefore, the principal should offer a high wage of $32 to maximize their expected payoff given this moral hazard situation."
