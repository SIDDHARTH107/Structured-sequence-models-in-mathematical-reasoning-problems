    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob using digital signatures. She uses the RSA signature scheme with a modulus of 253 (i.e., n=253) and her private key d=169. To sign the message, she first applies a hash function that maps her message to an integer m, then computes s = m^d mod n. If the resulting signature s is 37, what was the original message m that Alice sent?",
    "message_2": "To find the original message m, we need to reverse the process Alice used to create the signature s. Since s = m^d mod n, we can find m by computing the modular inverse of the private key d. In this case, we need to find the public key e such that (e * d) mod (n - 1) = 1.\n\nWe know that n = 253, so n - 1 = 252. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of d = 169 with respect to 252.\n\nApplying the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that e = 29 is the modular inverse of d = 169, since (29 * 169) mod 252 = 1.\n\nNow that we have the public key e, we can find the original message m by computing m = s^e mod n:\n\nm = 37^29 mod 253\nm = 161\n\nSo the original message m that Alice sent is 161."
