    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the signal s(t) = cos(2πt) + 2sin(4πt), we can use the following Fourier transform formulas:\n\nFourier transform of cos(ωt) = (1/2) [δ(ω - ω₀) + δ(ω + ω₀)]\nFourier transform of sin(ωt) = (1/2j) [δ(ω - ω₀) - δ(ω + ω₀)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function, ω₀ is the frequency of the sinusoidal function, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFor the first term, cos(2πt), ω₀ = 2π. Applying the Fourier transform formula for cosine, we get:\n\nFourier transform of cos(2πt) = (1/2) [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nFor the second term, 2sin(4πt), ω₀ = 4π. Applying the Fourier transform formula for sine, we get:\n\nFourier transform of 2sin(4πt) = (1/2j) [δ(ω - 4π) - δ(ω + 4π)] * 2\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier transforms of the two terms to find the Fourier transform of the entire signal:\n\nFourier transform of s(t) = (1/2) [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)] + (1/j) [δ(ω - 4π) - δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nTo analyze the frequency content, we can look at the Dirac delta functions in the Fourier transform. The signal s(t) has frequency components at ω = ±2π and ω = ±4π. The amplitude of the frequency component at ω = ±2π is 1/2, and the amplitude of the frequency component at ω = ±4π is 1/j. This means that the signal has a stronger frequency component at ω = ±4π (with a phase shift) compared to the frequency component at ω = ±2π."
