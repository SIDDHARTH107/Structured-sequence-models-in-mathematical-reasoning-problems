    "message_2": "To find the number of rational curves of degree 5 on a quintic threefold in complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^4$, we can use the mirror symmetry techniques and Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\nMirror symmetry relates the enumerative geometry of a Calabi-Yau manifold (in this case, the quintic threefold) to the variation of Hodge structures of its mirror dual. The Gromov-Witten invariants count the number of rational curves of a given degree on the Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\nFor a quintic threefold in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$, the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants are given by the following formula:\n\n$$N_d = \\frac{5^{3d-1}(3d-1)!}{(d!)^3}$$\n\nwhere $N_d$ is the number of rational curves of degree $d$ on the quintic threefold.\n\nIn our case, we are interested in the number of rational curves of degree 5, so we need to compute $N_5$:\n\n$$N_5 = \\frac{5^{3\\cdot5-1}(3\\cdot5-1)!}{(5!)^3} = \\frac{5^{14}\\cdot14!}{(5!)^3} = \\frac{5^{14}\\cdot14!}{(120)^3}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the value:\n\n$$N_5 = \\frac{5^{14}\\cdot14!}{(120)^3} = \\frac{6,103,515,625\\cdot87,178,291,200}{1,728,000,000} = 2875$$\n\nSo, there are 2875 rational curves of degree 5 on a quintic threefold in complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^4$."
