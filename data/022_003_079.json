    "message_2": "To evaluate the complex line integral, we will parameterize the curve $C$ and then compute the integral.\n\nSince $C$ is the circle with radius 2 centered at the origin, we can parameterize it as follows:\n\n$$z(t) = 2e^{it}, \\quad 0 \\le t \\le 2\\pi$$\n\nNow we need to find the derivative of $z(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{dz}{dt} = 2ie^{it}$$\n\nNext, we substitute the parameterization into the integrand:\n\n$$z^2 \\cos(z) = (2e^{it})^2 \\cos(2e^{it}) = 4e^{2it} \\cos(2e^{it})$$\n\nNow we can write the integral as:\n\n$$\\int_C z^2 \\cos(z) \\, dz = \\int_0^{2\\pi} 4e^{2it} \\cos(2e^{it}) \\cdot 2ie^{it} \\, dt$$\n\nLet's simplify the integrand:\n\n$$8ie^{3it} \\cos(2e^{it})$$\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral:\n\n$$\\int_0^{2\\pi} 8ie^{3it} \\cos(2e^{it}) \\, dt$$\n\nThis integral is quite difficult to evaluate directly. However, we can use Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed curve is zero. \n\nTo apply Cauchy's integral theorem, we need to check if the function $f(z) = z^2 \\cos(z)$ is analytic. A function is analytic if it is differentiable everywhere in its domain. The function $f(z)$ is the product of two analytic functions ($z^2$ and $\\cos(z)$), so it is also analytic.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is analytic, we can apply Cauchy's integral theorem, and the integral is:\n\n$$\\int_C z^2 \\cos(z) \\, dz = 0$$"
