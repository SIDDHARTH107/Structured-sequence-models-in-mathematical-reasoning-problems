    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator * on the 3-dimensional manifold M with the given metric, we first need to define the volume form. In this case, the volume form is given by:\n\nvol = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge star operator * on the given differential form α:\n\nα = dx ∧ dy + dy ∧ dz\n\nWe need to find a differential form β such that:\n\nα ∧ β = vol\n\nLet β = A dx ∧ dz + B dz ∧ dx + C dy ∧ dx, where A, B, and C are scalar functions to be determined.\n\nNow, let's compute α ∧ β:\n\nα ∧ β = (dx ∧ dy + dy ∧ dz) ∧ (A dx ∧ dz + B dz ∧ dx + C dy ∧ dx)\n\nUsing the properties of the wedge product, we get:\n\nα ∧ β = (dx ∧ dy) ∧ (C dy ∧ dx) + (dy ∧ dz) ∧ (A dx ∧ dz)\n\nNow, using the antisymmetry property of the wedge product, we can simplify the expression:\n\nα ∧ β = -C dx ∧ dy ∧ dy ∧ dx + A dy ∧ dz ∧ dx ∧ dz\n\nSince dx ∧ dy ∧ dy ∧ dx = 0 and dy ∧ dz ∧ dx ∧ dz = 0, we have:\n\nα ∧ β = 0\n\nThis means that α is a 2-form, and we need to find a 1-form β such that *α = β. Let β = P dx + Q dy + R dz, where P, Q, and R are scalar functions to be determined.\n\nNow, let's compute α ∧ β:\n\nα ∧ β = (dx ∧ dy + dy ∧ dz) ∧ (P dx + Q dy + R dz)\n\nExpanding the wedge product, we get:\n\nα ∧ β = P dx ∧ dy ∧ dx + Q dx ∧ dy ∧ dy + R dx ∧ dy ∧ dz + P dy ∧ dz ∧ dx + Q dy ∧ dz ∧ dy + R dy ∧ dz ∧ dz\n\nUsing the antisymmetry property of the wedge product, we can simplify the expression:\n\nα ∧ β = R dx ∧ dy ∧ dz + P dy ∧ dz ∧ dx\n\nNow, we want α ∧ β = vol, which means:\n\nR dx ∧ dy ∧ dz + P dy ∧ dz ∧ dx = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get:\n\nR = 1 and P = 0\n\nSo, the Hodge star operator *α is given by:\n\n*α = dz\n\nThus, the Hodge star operator * on the given differential form α = dx ∧ dy + dy ∧ dz is *α = dz."
