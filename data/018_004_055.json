    "message_2": "To show that the complement of both sets is unique, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of set A and set B with respect to the universal set U.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. So, A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nSimilarly, the complement of set B, denoted as B', is the set of all elements in U that are not in B. So, B' = {1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nAs we can see, the complements A' and B' are different sets, which means the complement of both sets A and B is unique."
