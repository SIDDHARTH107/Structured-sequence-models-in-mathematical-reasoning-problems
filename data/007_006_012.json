    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 56 and 98 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (98) by the smaller number (56) and find the remainder.\n   98 รท 56 = 1 (remainder 42)\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (56) and the smaller number with the remainder (42) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 56 and 42.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (56) by the new smaller number (42) and find the remainder.\n   56 รท 42 = 1 (remainder 14)\n\n4. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (42) and the smaller number with the remainder (14) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 42 and 14.\n\n5. Divide the new larger number (42) by the new smaller number (14) and find the remainder.\n   42 รท 14 = 3 (remainder 0)\n\n6. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 14.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 56 and 98 is 14."
