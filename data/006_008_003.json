    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in June)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the number of trials (days in June)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 30 (days in June)\n- k = 10 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.3 (probability of rain on a given day)\n\nFirst, let's find C(30, 10), which is the number of ways to choose 10 rainy days out of 30 days:\n\nC(30, 10) = 30! / (10! * (30-10)!)\nC(30, 10) = 30! / (10! * 20!)\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(30, 10) * 0.3^10 * (1-0.3)^(30-10)\nP(X = 10) = C(30, 10) * 0.3^10 * 0.7^20\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nC(30, 10) = 30045015\n0.3^10 ≈ 0.0000059049\n0.7^20 ≈ 0.0007976644\n\nNow, multiply these values together:\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 30045015 * 0.0000059049 * 0.0007976644\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.141141\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 10 days during the month of June in this city is approximately 0.141 or 14.1%."
