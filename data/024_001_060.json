    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve r(t) = 2t i + t^2 j + 2t^3 k at t = 1, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of r(t) with respect to t.\n\nFirst derivative (tangent vector):\nr'(t) = dr/dt = 2 i + 2t j + 6t^2 k\n\nSecond derivative (curvature vector):\nr''(t) = d^2r/dt^2 = 2 j + 12t k\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude of r'(t) and r''(t) at t = 1.\n\nr'(1) = 2 i + 2 j + 6 k\n|r'(1)| = √(2^2 + 2^2 + 6^2) = √(4 + 4 + 36) = √44\n\nr''(1) = 2 j + 12 k\n|r''(1)| = √(2^2 + 12^2) = √(4 + 144) = √148\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk = |r'(t) × r''(t)| / |r'(t)|^3\n\nCross product of r'(1) and r''(1):\nr'(1) × r''(1) = (2 i + 2 j + 6 k) × (2 j + 12 k)\n= -24 i + 4 j + 12 k\n\n|r'(1) × r''(1)| = √((-24)^2 + 4^2 + 12^2) = √(576 + 16 + 144) = √736\n\nNow, we can find the curvature k:\n\nk = |r'(1) × r''(1)| / |r'(1)|^3 = √736 / (√44)^3 = √736 / 85184 = 0.0271\n\nTo find the torsion (τ), we need to find the third derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'''(t) = d^3r/dt^3 = 12 k\n\nNow, we can find the torsion τ using the formula:\n\nτ = (r'(t) × r''(t)) • r'''(t) / |r'(t) × r''(t)|^2\n\nDot product of (r'(1) × r''(1)) and r'''(1):\n(-24 i + 4 j + 12 k) • (12 k) = 0 - 0 + 144 = 144\n\nNow, we can find the torsion τ:\n\nτ = (r'(1) × r''(1)) • r'''(1) / |r'(1) × r''(1)|^2 = 144 / (√736)^2 = 144 / 736 = 0.1957\n\nSo, the curvature k of the space curve r(t) at t = 1 is approximately 0.0271, and the torsion τ is approximately 0.1957."
