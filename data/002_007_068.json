    "message_1": "What is the area of a trapezoid with a height of 8 centimeters, a base of 12 centimeters, and a top base of 6 centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 is 12 centimeters, base2 is 6 centimeters, and the height is 8 centimeters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 6) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * 18 * 8\nArea = 9 * 8\nArea = 72 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 72 square centimeters."
