    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly where there are two firms, A and B, producing identical goods. The total market demand is given by Q = 1000 - P, where P is the market price. The marginal cost of production for both firms is MC = 5. Firm A has the following linear inverse demand function: PA = 500 - 0.5QA. Determine the quantity of output Firm A should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To determine the quantity of output Firm A should produce to maximize its profit, we need to find the reaction function for Firm A. In a Cournot duopoly, each firm chooses its output level, taking the output level of the other firm as given. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total market quantity (Q) in terms of QA and QB:\n\nQ = QA + QB\n\nNext, we need to find the market price (P) in terms of QA and QB using the inverse demand function for Firm A:\n\nPA = 500 - 0.5QA\nP = PA (since the goods are identical)\n\nSo,\n\nP = 500 - 0.5QA\n\nNow, we can find the inverse demand function for the total market:\n\nQ = 1000 - P\nQA + QB = 1000 - (500 - 0.5QA)\nQA + QB = 500 + 0.5QA\n\nNow, we can solve for QB in terms of QA:\n\nQB = 500 - 0.5QA\n\nNext, we need to find the profit function for Firm A:\n\nProfit_A = (PA - MC) * QA\nProfit_A = ((500 - 0.5QA) - 5) * QA\nProfit_A = (495 - 0.5QA) * QA\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the first-order condition (FOC) by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to QA and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit_A)/dQA = 495 - QA = 0\n\nSolving for QA:\n\nQA = 495\n\nSo, Firm A should produce 495 units of output to maximize its profit in this Cournot duopoly."
