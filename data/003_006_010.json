    "message_2": "To find the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle, we can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths, and A, B, and C are the angles opposite those sides.\n\nWe know the angles A = 30 degrees, B = 70 degrees, and since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, C = 180 - 30 - 70 = 80 degrees. We also know the length of the side opposite the 70-degree angle, which is b = 12 cm.\n\nWe want to find the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle, which is a. Using the Law of Sines, we can set up the following equation:\n\na/sin(30) = 12/sin(70)\n\nNow, we can solve for a:\n\na = (12 * sin(30))/sin(70)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values:\n\na = (12 * 0.5)/0.9397 â‰ˆ 6.38 cm\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle is approximately 6.38 cm."
