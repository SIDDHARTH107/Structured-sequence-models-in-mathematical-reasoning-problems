    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}\nA ∩ B = {3, 5}\nA Δ B = {2, 7, 11}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\nB ∪ A = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}\nB ∩ A = {3, 5}\nB Δ A = {2, 7, 11}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A):\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {2, 7, 11} x {2, 7, 11}\n\nThe Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A Δ B and b is in B Δ A:\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(2, 2), (2, 7), (2, 11), (7, 2), (7, 7), (7, 11), (11, 2), (11, 7), (11, 11)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (B Δ A) and (A Δ B):\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {2, 7, 11} x {2, 7, 11}\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {(2, 2), (2, 7), (2, 11), (7, 2), (7, 7), (7, 11), (11, 2), (11, 7), (11, 11)}\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that they are equal:\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = (B Δ A) x (A Δ B)\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences is commutative in this case."
