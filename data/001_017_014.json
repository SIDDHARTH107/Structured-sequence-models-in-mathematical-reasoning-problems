    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log(base 5) (x+1) = 3, we can use the property of logarithms that states:\n\nlog(base b) (a) = c is equivalent to a = b^c\n\nIn this case, our base (b) is 5, and our exponent (c) is 3. So we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx + 1 = 5^3\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx + 1 = 125\nx = 125 - 1\nx = 124\n\nSo, the solution for the equation log(base 5) (x+1) = 3 is x = 124."
