    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem for a math student to solve:\n\nFind the values of sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle in standard position, if its terminal side passes through the point (4, -3). Round your answers to two decimal places.\n\n(Note: In trigonometry, an angle in standard position is an angle in the coordinate plane where the initial side is on the positive x-axis and the vertex is at the origin.)",
    "message_2": "To find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle, we first need to find the length of the hypotenuse (r) of the right triangle formed by the point (4, -3) and the origin (0, 0). We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this:\n\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\nr^2 = (4)^2 + (-3)^2\nr^2 = 16 + 9\nr^2 = 25\nr = √25\nr = 5\n\nNow that we have the length of the hypotenuse (r = 5), we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle:\n\nsine (sin) = opposite side / hypotenuse = y / r\nsin = -3 / 5\nsin ≈ -0.60 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\ncosine (cos) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = x / r\ncos = 4 / 5\ncos ≈ 0.80 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\ntangent (tan) = opposite side / adjacent side = y / x\ntan = -3 / 4\ntan ≈ -0.75 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle are approximately -0.60, 0.80, and -0.75, respectively."
