    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $50,000 that it can allocate to its three departments - Sales, Marketing and Administration - in order to maximize their overall productivity. The Sales department generates $60 of profit for every dollar spent on it, the Marketing department generates $40 of profit for every dollar spent on it, and the Administration department generates $20 of profit for every dollar spent on it. \n\nAssuming that the total allocation to all three departments is $50,000, what is the optimal allocation strategy that will generate the maximum profit for the company?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the overall profit, the company should allocate the budget to the departments with the highest profit per dollar spent. In this case, the Sales department generates the highest profit per dollar spent ($60), followed by the Marketing department ($40), and then the Administration department ($20).\n\nSince the Sales department generates the highest profit per dollar, the company should allocate as much of the budget as possible to the Sales department. Therefore, the optimal allocation strategy would be:\n\n1. Allocate the entire $50,000 budget to the Sales department.\n2. If there are any constraints or requirements for allocating funds to the other departments, the company should allocate the remaining budget to the Marketing department, as it generates the second-highest profit per dollar spent.\n3. If there are still funds left to allocate, the company should allocate the remaining budget to the Administration department.\n\nWith this allocation strategy, the company can generate the maximum profit as follows:\n\n- Sales department: $50,000 * $60 = $3,000,000\n- Marketing department: $0 * $40 = $0\n- Administration department: $0 * $20 = $0\n\nTotal profit: $3,000,000\n\nThis strategy assumes that there are no constraints or requirements for allocating funds to the other departments. If there are such constraints, the company should adjust the allocations accordingly while still prioritizing the departments with the highest profit per dollar spent."
