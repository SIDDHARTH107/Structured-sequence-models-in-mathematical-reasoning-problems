    "message_2": "Let's denote the group G as a group of order 18, so |G| = 18. We are given that H is a normal subgroup of G with |H| = 9. Since H is a subgroup of G, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G. In this case, 9 divides 18, so H is a valid subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of H. Since |H| = 9, and 9 = 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of H, say P, with order 3^2 = 9. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups in H, denoted by n_3(H), satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_3(H) ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3(H) divides |H|\n\nSince |H| = 9, the possible values for n_3(H) are 1 and 9. However, if n_3(H) = 9, then it would not satisfy the first condition (n_3(H) ≡ 1 (mod 3)). Therefore, n_3(H) = 1, which means that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup in H, and it must be normal in H.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of P. Since |P| = 9, P can either be a cyclic group C9 or a non-abelian group of order 9. We will analyze both cases:\n\nCase 1: P is isomorphic to C9\nIf P is isomorphic to C9, then P is generated by an element of order 9, say a. That is, P = ⟨a⟩ = {1, a, a^2, ..., a^8}. Since P is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of H and is normal in H, H must be isomorphic to P, which is C9 in this case.\n\nCase 2: P is a non-abelian group of order 9\nIf P is a non-abelian group of order 9, then it cannot be a cyclic group. In this case, H must be isomorphic to P, which is the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, if H is a normal subgroup of G with |H| = 9, then H is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9."
