    "message_2": "To find the mean, median, and mode of the data set, we first need to organize the data in ascending order:\n\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12\n\nMean:\nThe mean is the average of the data set. To find the mean, we add up all the numbers and divide by the total number of values.\n\n(5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 12 + 12) / 10 = 92 / 10 = 9.2\n\nThe mean is 9.2.\n\nMedian:\nThe median is the middle value of the data set. Since there are 10 values, we take the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th values).\n\n(9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5\n\nThe median is 9.5.\n\nMode:\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in the data set. In this case, the number 12 appears three times, which is more than any other number.\n\nThe mode is 12.\n\nSo, the mean is 9.2, the median is 9.5, and the mode is 12."
