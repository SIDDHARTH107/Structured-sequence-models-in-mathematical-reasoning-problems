    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n, and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we want to choose 5 chocolates (k = 5) from a box of 15 different chocolates (n = 15). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15-5)!)\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!10!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 1,307,674,368,000\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nC(15, 5) = 1,307,674,368,000 / (120 × 3,628,800)\n\nC(15, 5) = 1,307,674,368,000 / 435,456,000\n\nC(15, 5) = 3,003\n\nSo, there are 3,003 ways to choose 5 chocolates from a box of 15 different chocolates when the order of selection doesn't matter."
