    "message_1": "Suppose Alice and Bob want to share a secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice chooses a prime number p = 11 and a primitive root g = 2. She selects a secret number a = 5 and computes g^a mod p. Bob selects a secret number b = 7 and computes g^b mod p. What is the shared secret key between Alice and Bob?",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the values of g^a mod p and g^b mod p:\n\nAlice: g^a mod p = 2^5 mod 11 = 32 mod 11 = 9\nBob: g^b mod p = 2^7 mod 11 = 128 mod 11 = 7\n\nNow, Alice and Bob exchange these values. To compute the shared secret key, Alice raises Bob's value to the power of her secret number a modulo p, and Bob raises Alice's value to the power of his secret number b modulo p. Both calculations should result in the same value:\n\nAlice: 7^5 mod 11 = 16807 mod 11 = 3\nBob: 9^7 mod 11 = 4782969 mod 11 = 3\n\nThe shared secret key between Alice and Bob is 3."
