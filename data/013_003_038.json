    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Alice proposes to split a sum of $100 between her and Bob. If Bob accepts the proposal, they each get their share of the money. If Bob rejects the proposal, both get nothing. Assume that Bob values the money linearly, such that getting $x$ dollars is worth $x$ utility points to him. If both players are rational and care only about their own utility, what is the smallest amount of money that Alice can offer to Bob to ensure that he accepts the proposal?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, Alice knows that Bob is rational and only cares about his own utility. Therefore, Bob will accept any offer that gives him a positive utility, since getting something is better than getting nothing. \n\nThe smallest amount of money that Alice can offer to Bob to ensure that he accepts the proposal is $1. In this case, Bob gets $1 (1 utility point) and Alice gets $99. If Alice offers Bob $0, he will reject the proposal since his utility would be 0, and both would get nothing. However, by offering $1, Alice ensures that Bob has a positive utility, and as a rational player, he will accept the offer."
