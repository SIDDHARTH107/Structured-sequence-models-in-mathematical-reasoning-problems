    "message_2": "To find the value of $\\arcsin(\\frac{1}{2})$, we need to determine the angle whose sine is $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nRecall that the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants. In the first quadrant, we have a special angle, $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ (or $30^\\circ$), for which the sine value is $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nTherefore, $\\arcsin(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$."
