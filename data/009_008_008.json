    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and wave speed of the wave, we need to analyze the given wave equation:\n\ny(x,t) = 0.5sin(0.5πx)cos(100πt)\n\nThis equation is in the form of a product of two functions, one of position (x) and the other of time (t). The general form of such a wave equation is:\n\ny(x,t) = A sin(kx) cos(ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and x and t are the position and time variables, respectively.\n\nComparing the given equation with the general form, we can identify the following:\n\nAmplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position. In this case, the amplitude is given by the coefficient of the sine and cosine functions, which is 0.5. Therefore, the amplitude is:\n\nA = 0.5 meters\n\nWavelength (λ) and wave number (k):\nThe wave number k is related to the wavelength λ by the equation:\n\nk = 2π/λ\n\nFrom the given wave equation, we can see that k = 0.5π. To find the wavelength, we can rearrange the equation above and solve for λ:\n\nλ = 2π/k = 2π/(0.5π) = 4 meters\n\nFrequency (f) and angular frequency (ω):\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f by the equation:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nFrom the given wave equation, we can see that ω = 100π. To find the frequency, we can rearrange the equation above and solve for f:\n\nf = ω/(2π) = (100π)/(2π) = 50 Hz\n\nWave speed (v):\nThe wave speed can be found using the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and wave speed:\n\nv = λf\n\nSubstituting the values of λ and f that we found earlier:\n\nv = (4 meters)(50 Hz) = 200 meters/second\n\nIn summary, the wave has an amplitude of 0.5 meters, a wavelength of 4 meters, a frequency of 50 Hz, and a wave speed of 200 meters/second."
