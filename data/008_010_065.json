    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n       | 1  2  3 | 12\n       | 2  3  2 | 13\n       | 3  2  1 | 7\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows. To do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n\n       R2 = R2 - 2*R1\n       R3 = R3 - 3*R1\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n       | 1  2  3 | 12\n       | 0 -1 -4 | -11\n       | 0 -4 -8 | -29\n\nNext, we will eliminate the y term in the third row. To do this, we will perform the following row operation:\n\n       R3 = R3 - 4*R2\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n       | 1  2  3 | 12\n       | 0 -1 -4 | -11\n       | 0  0  8 |  15\n\nStep 3: Use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nNow that we have an upper triangular matrix, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n       8z = 15\n       z = 15/8\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n       -y - 4z = -11\n       -y - 4(15/8) = -11\n       -y - 15/2 = -11\n       y = 7/2\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n       x + 2y + 3z = 12\n       x + 2(7/2) + 3(15/8) = 12\n       x + 7 + 45/8 = 12\n       x = 49/8\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\n       x = 49/8\n       y = 7/2\n       z = 15/8"
