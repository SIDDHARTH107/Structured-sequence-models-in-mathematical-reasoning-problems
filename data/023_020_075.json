    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x/(1+x^2) in the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe coefficients a_n and b_n are given by the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x/(1+x^2)) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, the integral of f(x) over the symmetric interval [-π, π] is zero. Therefore, a_0 = 0.\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x/(1+x^2)) * cos(nx) dx\n\nAgain, since f(x) is an odd function and cos(nx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. Therefore, the integral over the symmetric interval is zero. So, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x/(1+x^2)) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function and sin(nx) is an odd function, their product is an even function. We can use the property of even functions to simplify the integral:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] (x/(1+x^2)) * sin(nx) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(nx) / (1+x^2) dx\nThen, du = dx and v = (-1/n) * atan(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-x/n) * atan(nx) |[0, π] - ∫[0, π] (-1/n) * atan(nx) dx]\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(2/π) * atan(nπ) + (1/n) * ∫[0, π] atan(nx) dx]\n\nThe integral ∫[0, π] atan(nx) dx does not have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. However, we can still express the Fourier series using the b_n coefficients:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2/π) * atan(nπ) * sin(nx)/n]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
