    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group of X, we first note that the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 defines a smooth quadric surface in P^3. The cohomology groups of smooth projective varieties can be computed using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the long exact sequence associated with the cohomology of a pair.\n\nLet H be a hyperplane in P^3, and let U = P^3 - H. Then X ∩ U is a smooth quadric surface in U, and the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem tells us that the restriction map H^2(P^3) → H^2(U) is an isomorphism. Since H^2(P^3) = Z, it follows that H^2(U) = Z as well.\n\nNow consider the long exact sequence in cohomology associated with the pair (U, X ∩ U):\n\n... → H^1(X ∩ U) → H^2(U, X ∩ U) → H^2(U) → H^2(X ∩ U) → ...\n\nBy the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, H^1(X ∩ U) = 0 and H^2(X ∩ U) = 0. Therefore, the long exact sequence becomes:\n\n... → 0 → H^2(U, X ∩ U) → H^2(U) → 0 → ...\n\nThis implies that H^2(U, X ∩ U) ≅ H^2(U) = Z.\n\nNow, let's compute the second cohomology group of X. Since X is a smooth quadric surface in P^3, it is isomorphic to P^1 × P^1. The Künneth formula gives us the cohomology ring of X:\n\nH^*(X) = H^*(P^1) ⊗ H^*(P^1) = (Z[a] / (a^2)) ⊗ (Z[b] / (b^2)),\n\nwhere deg(a) = deg(b) = 2. Thus, the second cohomology group of X is given by:\n\nH^2(X) = Z[a] ⊗ Z + Z ⊗ Z[b] = Z ⨁ Z.\n\nSo, the second cohomology group of X is H^2(X) = Z ⨁ Z."
