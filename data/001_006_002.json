    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x - 5, we can use the vertex formula: x = -b / 2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic and linear terms, respectively.\n\nIn this case, a = 1 and b = 4. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\nx = -4 / (2 * 1) = -4 / 2 = -2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) - 5 = 4 - 8 - 5 = -9\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (-2, -9).\n\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^2 + 4x - 5\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(-5))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 20)) / 2\n\nx = (-4 ± √36) / 2\n\nx = (-4 ± 6) / 2\n\nThe two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = (-4 + 6) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nx = (-4 - 6) / 2 = -10 / 2 = -5\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are (1, 0) and (-5, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 0^2 + 4(0) - 5 = -5\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -5).\n\nIn summary, the vertex of the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x - 5 is (-2, -9), the x-intercepts are (1, 0) and (-5, 0), and the y-intercept is (0, -5)."
