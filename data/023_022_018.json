    "message_1": "Suppose a financial analyst wants to analyze the returns of a stock over a 10-year period. The analyst takes the returns data from each trading day during the 10-year period and applies the Fourier transform to it. If the analyst obtains a peak frequency of 0.05 cycles per day in the resulting Fourier spectrum, what is the corresponding periodicity of the returns fluctuations?",
    "message_2": "To find the corresponding periodicity of the returns fluctuations, we need to calculate the inverse of the peak frequency. The peak frequency is given as 0.05 cycles per day. \n\nPeriodicity = 1 / Peak Frequency\n\nPeriodicity = 1 / 0.05 cycles per day\n\nPeriodicity = 20 days\n\nSo, the corresponding periodicity of the returns fluctuations is 20 days."
