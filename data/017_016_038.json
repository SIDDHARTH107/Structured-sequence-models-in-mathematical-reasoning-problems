    "message_2": "There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 27. We will show that every group of order 27 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nLet G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide 27 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27. However, if n_3 = 27, then there would be 27 * (3-1) = 54 elements of order 3 in G, which is impossible since G has only 27 elements. Therefore, n_3 = 1, and there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P of G.\n\nSince P is the unique 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Now, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIf G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Since there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, G is isomorphic to P, which is a cyclic group of order 27. In this case, G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nLet x and y be two non-commuting elements in G. Since P is normal in G, the set {x^i * y^j | 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 2} forms a subgroup of G. This subgroup has 9 elements, and since G has 27 elements, the index of this subgroup in G is 3. By the Normalizer-Centralizer Theorem, the normalizer of this subgroup in G is equal to its centralizer, which is the set of all elements in G that commute with all elements in the subgroup.\n\nSince x and y do not commute, the centralizer of the subgroup is a proper subgroup of G. Let z be an element in G that is not in the centralizer. Then the set {z^i * x^j * y^k | 0 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 2} forms a subgroup of G with 27 elements, which must be equal to G. This subgroup is non-abelian since x and y do not commute. In this case, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 27: the cyclic group C27 and the non-abelian group of order 27. Every group of order 27 is isomorphic to one of these two groups."
