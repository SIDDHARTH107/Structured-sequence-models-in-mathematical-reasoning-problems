    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the space between three mutually tangent circles with smaller circles that are also mutually tangent. The curvatures of the circles in an Apollonian gasket can be found using Descartes' Circle Theorem, which states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4, the following equation holds:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nGiven the initial circles with curvatures 1, 1, and 1, we can find the curvature of the fourth circle using the equation:\n\n(1 + 1 + 1 + k4)^2 = 2(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + k4^2)\n\nSolving for k4, we get k4 = 2. So, the initial set of curvatures is {1, 1, 1, 2}.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the curvatures for the Apollonian gasket with a maximum iteration level of 4. At each iteration level, we will generate new circles by applying Descartes' Circle Theorem to each unique combination of three circles. The number of new circles generated at each level is given by the formula:\n\nNew circles at level n = 2^(n-1) + 1\n\nThe sum of the curvatures at each level can be found by multiplying the number of new circles at that level by the curvature of the new circles. The curvature of the new circles can be found using the formula:\n\nk_new = 2 * k_previous - k_initial\n\nwhere k_initial is the curvature of the initial circle (1 in this case) and k_previous is the curvature of the new circle in the previous iteration level.\n\nUsing these formulas, we can find the sum of the curvatures for each iteration level:\n\nLevel 1: 4 * 1 = 4 (Initial circles)\nLevel 2: (2^(2-1) + 1) * (2 * 1 - 1) = 3 * 1 = 3\nLevel 3: (2^(3-1) + 1) * (2 * 1 - 1) = 5 * 1 = 5\nLevel 4: (2^(4-1) + 1) * (2 * 1 - 1) = 9 * 1 = 9\n\nThe sum of the curvatures for the Apollonian gasket with a maximum iteration level of 4 is:\n\n4 (initial circles) + 3 (level 2) + 5 (level 3) + 9 (level 4) = 21"
