    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of the given 2-form $\\omega$, we will apply the exterior derivative to each term individually and then sum the results. Recall that the exterior derivative is a linear operator and satisfies the product rule.\n\nFirst, let's find the exterior derivative of each term:\n\n1. $d(x dy \\wedge dz) = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$\n2. $d(y dz \\wedge dx) = dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$\n3. $d(z dx \\wedge dy) = dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$\n\nNow, sum the results:\n\n$d\\omega = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$\n\nHowever, we need to consider the orientation of the wedge products. Recall that if two adjacent terms in a wedge product are swapped, the sign of the product changes. So, we can rewrite the second and third terms as:\n\n$dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx = - dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dz$\n\n$dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = - dz \\wedge dy \\wedge dx$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the expression for $d\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz - dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dz - dz \\wedge dy \\wedge dx$\n\nNow, we can factor out the common wedge product:\n\n$d\\omega = (1 - (-1) - (-1)) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = 3 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the given 2-form $\\omega$ is:\n\n$d\\omega = 3 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$"
