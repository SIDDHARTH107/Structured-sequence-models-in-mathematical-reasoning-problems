    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x, y) = 2x + 3y subject to the constraint x^2 + 2y^2 ≤ 16, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nLet g(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2 - 16. The constraint can be written as g(x, y) ≤ 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of f(x, y) and g(x, y):\n\n∇f(x, y) = (2, 3)\n∇g(x, y) = (2x, 4y)\n\nAccording to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we need to find a point (x, y) where ∇f(x, y) = λ∇g(x, y) for some scalar λ.\n\n(2, 3) = λ(2x, 4y)\n2 = 2xλ\n3 = 4yλ\n\nDivide the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 4:\n\n1 = xλ\n3/4 = yλ\n\nNow, we can find λ:\n\nλ = 1/x\nλ = 3/(4y)\n\nEquating the two expressions for λ:\n\n1/x = 3/(4y)\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n4y = 3x\n\nNow, we need to find x and y that satisfy both the constraint and this equation. Substitute x from the constraint into the equation:\n\n4y = 3(√(16 - 2y^2))\n16y^2 = 9(16 - 2y^2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n16y^2 = 144 - 18y^2\n34y^2 = 144\ny^2 = 144/34\ny^2 = 4.2353\ny = ±√4.2353\ny ≈ ±2.058\n\nNow, find the corresponding x values:\n\nx = 3/4 * y\nx ≈ ±1.5435\n\nWe have two points: (1.5435, 2.058) and (-1.5435, -2.058). Since we are looking for the minimum value of f(x, y), we should choose the point with the negative values:\n\nx = -1.5435\ny = -2.058\n\nNow, plug these values into the function f(x, y):\n\nf(x, y) = 2x + 3y\nf(-1.5435, -2.058) = 2(-1.5435) + 3(-2.058)\nf(-1.5435, -2.058) ≈ -9.261\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f(x, y) subject to the constraint x^2 + 2y^2 ≤ 16 is approximately -9.261."
