    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S by the position vector r(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2), where u = x and v = y. Then, we can find the tangent vectors r_u and r_v:\n\nr_u = ∂r/∂u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = ∂r/∂v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we can find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we need to find the second fundamental form coefficients. First, we find the normal vector N:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, 2v) = (-4u, -4v, 1)\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • r_uu = (-4u, -4v, 1) • (0, 0, 2) = 2\nM = N • r_uv = (-4u, -4v, 1) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\nN = N • r_vv = (-4u, -4v, 1) • (0, 0, 2) = 2\n\nFinally, we can find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nL = 2\nM = 0\nN = 2\n\nSo, we get:\n\nK = (2*2 - 0^2) / (5*5 - 4^2) = 4 / 9\n\nTherefore, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1) is 4/9."
