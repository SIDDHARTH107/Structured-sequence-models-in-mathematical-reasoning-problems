    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of the cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe area of a square is found by squaring the side length. In this case, the side length is 8 cm.\n\nArea of one face = side length^2 = 8 cm * 8 cm = 64 square cm\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube.\n\nSurface area of the cube = 6 * 64 square cm = 384 square cm"
