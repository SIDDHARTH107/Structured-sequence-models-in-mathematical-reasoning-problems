    "message_1": "A math teacher wants to test her student's understanding of outlier detection. She gave a statistics quiz with 10 questions to her class. The scores are as follows:\n\n{80, 90, 85, 75, 95, 100, 70, 82, 76, 165}\n\nCalculate the median, the mean, and the standard deviation of the quiz scores. Is there any outlier in the data? If yes, which score is an outlier?",
    "message_2": "First, let's order the scores from lowest to highest:\n\n{70, 75, 76, 80, 82, 85, 90, 95, 100, 165}\n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value. Since there are 10 scores, we will take the average of the 5th and 6th scores:\n\nMedian = (82 + 85) / 2 = 167 / 2 = 83.5\n\nNow, let's calculate the mean. To do this, we will add up all the scores and divide by the number of scores:\n\nMean = (70 + 75 + 76 + 80 + 82 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100 + 165) / 10 = 918 / 10 = 91.8\n\nNext, we will find the standard deviation. First, we need to calculate the variance. To do this, we will find the difference between each score and the mean, square these differences, and then find the average of these squared differences:\n\n(70 - 91.8)^2 = 476.1\n(75 - 91.8)^2 = 283.24\n(76 - 91.8)^2 = 249.64\n(80 - 91.8)^2 = 139.24\n(82 - 91.8)^2 = 96.04\n(85 - 91.8)^2 = 46.24\n(90 - 91.8)^2 = 3.24\n(95 - 91.8)^2 = 10.24\n(100 - 91.8)^2 = 67.24\n(165 - 91.8)^2 = 5356.84\n\nNow, we will find the average of these squared differences:\n\nVariance = (476.1 + 283.24 + 249.64 + 139.24 + 96.04 + 46.24 + 3.24 + 10.24 + 67.24 + 5356.84) / 10 = 6727.56 / 10 = 672.756\n\nFinally, we will find the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance:\n\nStandard Deviation = √672.756 ≈ 25.93\n\nNow, let's check for outliers. A common method for detecting outliers is to use the 1.5 * IQR (Interquartile Range) rule. First, we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Since there are 10 scores, the first quartile is the average of the 2nd and 3rd scores, and the third quartile is the average of the 8th and 9th scores:\n\nQ1 = (75 + 76) / 2 = 151 / 2 = 75.5\nQ3 = (95 + 100) / 2 = 195 / 2 = 97.5\n\nNow, we will find the IQR:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 97.5 - 75.5 = 22\n\nNext, we will find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 75.5 - 1.5 * 22 = 75.5 - 33 = 42.5\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 97.5 + 1.5 * 22 = 97.5 + 33 = 130.5\n\nNow, we can see that the score 165 is an outlier since it is greater than the upper bound of 130.5.\n\nSo, the median is 83.5, the mean is 91.8, the standard deviation is approximately 25.93, and there is one outlier, which is the score 165."
