For this, we need to check if (A × B) ∩ A = (B × A) ∩ A.\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = {} \n(B × A) ∩ A = {}\n\nSince both intersections are equal, it might seem that the Cartesian product is associative with respect to intersection. However, this is not a general proof, and we can find counterexamples that show that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection.\n\nConsider the following sets:\n\nA = {1}\nB = {2}\nC = {3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products and intersections:\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1,2),3)}\nB × (A × C) = {(2,(1,3))}\n\n(A × B) ∩ C = {} (since there are no elements in A × B that are also in C)\n(B × A) ∩ C = {} (since there are no elements in B × A that are also in C)\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is associative with respect to intersection:\n\n(A × B) × C ≠ B × (A × C) (since {((1,2),3)} ≠ {(2,(1,3))})\n\nThis counterexample shows that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection."
