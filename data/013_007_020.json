    "message_1": "Assuming there are 10 fishermen sharing a common fishing ground and each of them is allowed to catch up to 10 fish per day. However, if any one of them catches more than 10 fish, the excess will be deducted from the overall catch of the group. Find the optimal number of fish each fisherman should catch to maximize the overall catch and avoid the tragedy of the commons.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the overall catch and avoid the tragedy of the commons, each fisherman should catch exactly 10 fish per day. This way, no fisherman is catching more than the allowed limit, and there will be no excess fish to be deducted from the overall catch.\n\nIn this scenario, the overall catch will be maximized at 10 fish per fisherman * 10 fishermen = 100 fish per day."
