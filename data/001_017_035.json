    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+1) - log2(x-1) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\n1. Apply the subtraction property of logarithms: logb(m) - logb(n) = logb(m/n)\n\nlog2((x+1)/(x-1)) = 2\n\n2. Remove the logarithm by raising both sides as powers of the base (2 in this case):\n\n2^(log2((x+1)/(x-1))) = 2^2\n\n(x+1)/(x-1) = 4\n\n3. Solve for x:\n\n(x+1) = 4(x-1)\n\nx+1 = 4x-4\n\n4 - 1 = 4x - x\n\n3 = 3x\n\nx = 1\n\nHowever, we must check if this solution is valid by plugging it back into the original equation:\n\nlog2(1+1) - log2(1-1)\n\nlog2(2) - log2(0)\n\nSince the logarithm of 0 is undefined, x = 1 is not a valid solution. Therefore, there is no solution for the given equation."
