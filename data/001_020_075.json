    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |3x - 5|, we need to find the point where the expression inside the absolute value is equal to 0. \n\n3x - 5 = 0\n3x = 5\nx = 5/3\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = |3(5/3) - 5|\ny = |5 - 5|\ny = 0\n\nSo, the vertex of the absolute value equation is (5/3, 0).\n\nNext, we'll find the x-intercepts. The x-intercepts occur when y = 0:\n\n0 = |3x - 5|\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 5 = 0 (which we already solved above)\nx = 5/3\n\nCase 2: -(3x - 5) = 0\n3x - 5 = 5\n3x = 10\nx = 10/3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are (5/3, 0) and (10/3, 0).\n\nFinally, we'll find the y-intercept. The y-intercept occurs when x = 0:\n\ny = |3(0) - 5|\ny = |-5|\ny = 5\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 5).\n\nIn summary, the vertex is (5/3, 0), the x-intercepts are (5/3, 0) and (10/3, 0), and the y-intercept is (0, 5)."
