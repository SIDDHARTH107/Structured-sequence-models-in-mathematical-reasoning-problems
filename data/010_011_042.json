    "message_2": "To calculate the total Gaussian curvature of M, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact 2-manifold M with boundary, the total Gaussian curvature K is related to the Euler characteristic χ(M) and the geodesic curvature k_g of the boundary ∂M as follows:\n\n∫∫_M K dA + ∫_∂M k_g ds = 2πχ(M)\n\nSince M is a compact and connected 2-manifold with boundary consisting of two circles, its Euler characteristic χ(M) is 1. This is because M can be considered as a disk with two holes, and the Euler characteristic of a disk is 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the geodesic curvature k_g of the boundary ∂M. The geodesic curvature of a circle of radius r in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by:\n\nk_g = 1/r\n\nThus, the geodesic curvature of the two circles in the boundary of M is:\n\nk_g(∂M) = (1/r_1) + (1/r_2)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n∫∫_M K dA + ∫_∂M k_g ds = 2πχ(M)\n∫∫_M K dA + [(1/r_1) + (1/r_2)] * 2π = 2π\n\nSolving for the total Gaussian curvature ∫∫_M K dA, we get:\n\n∫∫_M K dA = 2π - 2π[(1/r_1) + (1/r_2)]\n∫∫_M K dA = 2π(1 - [(1/r_1) + (1/r_2)])\n\nThis is the total Gaussian curvature of the 2-manifold M."
