    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition between two firms, A and B, in a market whose demand curve has the equation Q = 140 - 2P, where P is the price of the good and Q is the quantity demanded. Firm A is the leader and sets its output level first, followed by firm B as the follower.\n\nIf firm A produces a quantity of 50 units, what quantity should firm B produce in order to maximize its profits? Assume each firm incurs a cost of $20 per unit produced.",
    "message_2": "To find the quantity that firm B should produce to maximize its profits, we first need to find the residual demand curve faced by firm B, given that firm A has already produced 50 units. \n\nThe total market demand is Q = 140 - 2P. Since firm A produces 50 units, the residual demand for firm B is:\n\nQ_B = (140 - 2P) - 50\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse demand function, which is the price as a function of quantity. To do this, we can solve the residual demand equation for P:\n\nQ_B + 50 = 140 - 2P\n2P = 140 - Q_B - 50\nP = (90 - Q_B) / 2\n\nNext, we need to find the marginal revenue for firm B. To do this, we can differentiate the revenue function with respect to Q_B:\n\nR_B = P * Q_B = ((90 - Q_B) / 2) * Q_B\n\nNow, we can find the marginal revenue by taking the derivative of R_B with respect to Q_B:\n\nMR_B = d(R_B) / d(Q_B) = (90 - 2Q_B) / 2\n\nSince the cost per unit produced is $20, the marginal cost (MC) for firm B is constant at MC = 20.\n\nTo maximize its profits, firm B should produce where its marginal revenue equals its marginal cost:\n\nMR_B = MC\n(90 - 2Q_B) / 2 = 20\n\nSolving for Q_B:\n\n90 - 2Q_B = 40\n2Q_B = 50\nQ_B = 25\n\nTherefore, firm B should produce 25 units to maximize its profits, given that firm A produces 50 units."
