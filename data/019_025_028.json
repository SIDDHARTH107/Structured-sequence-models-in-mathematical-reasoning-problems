    "message_2": "To find the total distance traveled, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 60 km/h and the time is 2 hours. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDistance = 60 km/h × 2 hours\n\nDistance = 120 km\n\nThe car has traveled a total distance of 120 kilometers."
