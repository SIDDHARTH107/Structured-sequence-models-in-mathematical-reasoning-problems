    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. In other words, (p-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod p). \n\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer n that satisfies this condition. Since the theorem holds for prime numbers, we can start by checking the smallest prime numbers.\n\nFor n = 2 (the smallest prime number), we have (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2. Therefore, the smallest positive integer n that satisfies Wilson's theorem is n = 2."
