    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to reverse the encryption process. The encrypted message is \"AAMTTFSSHIUEENCS\" and it was encrypted using rows of 3. So, we can arrange the encrypted message in columns of 3:\n\nA A M\nT T F\nS S H\nI U E\nE N C\nS\n\nNow, we read the message row-wise:\n\nThe decrypted message is \"MATHEMATICSISFUN\"."
