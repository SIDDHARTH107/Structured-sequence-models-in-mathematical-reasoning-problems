    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the velocity vector of the particle, we first need to determine the curve traced out by the particle after one complete revolution around the sphere. Since the particle moves on the surface of a sphere of radius 5 and has an initial position at (5,0,0) with an initial velocity in the positive y-direction, the particle will trace out a great circle on the sphere in the xy-plane.\n\nThe equation of the sphere is given by:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 5^2 = 25\n\nSince the particle moves in the xy-plane, z = 0. Therefore, the equation of the great circle is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 25\n\nNow, let's parameterize the curve traced out by the particle. We can use the angle θ as the parameter, where θ varies from 0 to 2π. The position vector of the particle is given by:\n\nr(θ) = <5cos(θ), 5sin(θ), 0>\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vector T(θ) by taking the derivative of r(θ) with respect to θ:\n\nT(θ) = <-5sin(θ), 5cos(θ), 0>\n\nSince the particle has an initial velocity in the positive y-direction, its initial velocity vector is:\n\nv(0) = <0, v_y, 0>\n\nTo find the parallel transport of the velocity vector v(0) along the curve, we need to ensure that the transported vector remains tangent to the curve at each point. This means that the transported vector should be parallel to T(θ) at each point on the curve.\n\nLet the transported vector be:\n\nv(θ) = <A(θ), B(θ), 0>\n\nSince v(θ) is parallel to T(θ), their cross product should be zero:\n\nv(θ) × T(θ) = <0, 0, A(θ) * 5cos(θ) + B(θ) * 5sin(θ)> = <0, 0, 0>\n\nThis implies that:\n\nA(θ) * 5cos(θ) + B(θ) * 5sin(θ) = 0\n\nNow, let's use the initial condition v(0) = <0, v_y, 0>:\n\nA(0) * 5cos(0) + B(0) * 5sin(0) = 0\nA(0) * 5 + B(0) * 0 = 0\nA(0) = 0\n\nSince A(0) = 0, we have:\n\nB(θ) * 5sin(θ) = 0\n\nSince sin(θ) is not always zero, we must have B(θ) = v_y (constant) for all θ.\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the velocity vector v(0) along the curve traced out by the particle after one complete revolution around the sphere is:\n\nv(θ) = <0, v_y, 0>\n\nThis means that the velocity vector remains in the positive y-direction throughout the revolution, maintaining its initial direction."
