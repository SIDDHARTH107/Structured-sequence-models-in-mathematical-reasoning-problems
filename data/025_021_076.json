Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nLet X be a Calabi-Yau manifold of complex dimension 3 with Hodge numbers h^{1,2}(X) = 101 and h^{2,1}(X) = 2. Use mirror symmetry to determine the Hodge numbers of the mirror manifold Y.",
    "message_2": "Mirror symmetry is a duality between Calabi-Yau manifolds that exchanges their Hodge numbers. Specifically, for a pair of mirror manifolds X and Y, we have the following relationship between their Hodge numbers:\n\nh^{p,q}(X) = h^{q,p}(Y)\n\nGiven that X is a Calabi-Yau manifold of complex dimension 3 with Hodge numbers h^{1,2}(X) = 101 and h^{2,1}(X) = 2, we can use mirror symmetry to determine the Hodge numbers of the mirror manifold Y:\n\nh^{1,2}(Y) = h^{2,1}(X) = 2\nh^{2,1}(Y) = h^{1,2}(X) = 101\n\nSo, the Hodge numbers of the mirror manifold Y are h^{1,2}(Y) = 2 and h^{2,1}(Y) = 101."
