    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of outcomes that satisfy this condition and divide by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are 3 outcomes that are greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:\n\n(Number of outcomes greater than 3) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a fair six-sided die is 1/2 or 50%."
