    "message_2": "a) To find the fixed point of the system, we need to find the value of x for which x_{n+1} = x_n. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\nx = 1.4 - x^2\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nx^2 + x - 1.4 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -1.4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4(1)(-1.4))) / 2(1)\nx = (-1 ± √(1 + 5.6)) / 2\nx = (-1 ± √6.6) / 2\n\nThere are two possible fixed points: x ≈ 0.819 and x ≈ -1.819. However, since the system is chaotic, we should consider the fixed point within the range of the function, which is x ≈ 0.819.\n\nb) To find the period of the fixed point, we need to determine how many iterations it takes for the system to return to the fixed point value. We can do this by applying the Poincaré map iteratively:\n\n1. Start with the fixed point value x ≈ 0.819.\n2. Apply the map: x_{n+1} = 1.4 - x_n^2.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the value of x_n returns to the fixed point value.\n\nHowever, since the system is chaotic, it is not guaranteed that the system will return to the fixed point value after a finite number of iterations. In fact, for chaotic systems, the period can be infinite or even non-existent. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the period of the fixed point using the Poincaré map for this chaotic system."
