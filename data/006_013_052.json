    "message_2": "To find the probability of either an earthquake or a tornado occurring in a given year, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nHere, A represents the event of an earthquake occurring, and B represents the event of a tornado occurring. We are given P(A) = 0.03 and P(B) = 0.02. \n\nHowever, we don't have the probability of both an earthquake and a tornado occurring in the same year, P(A and B). If we assume that earthquakes and tornadoes are independent events, then we can calculate P(A and B) as follows:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.03 * 0.02 = 0.0006\n\nNow, we can find the probability of either an earthquake or a tornado occurring:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.03 + 0.02 - 0.0006 = 0.0494\n\nSo, the probability of either an earthquake or a tornado occurring in the region in a given year is 0.0494 or 4.94%."
