    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 12 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the zeros of the first derivative. Newton's method is an iterative process that uses the formula:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the current approximation and x_n+1 is the next approximation.\n\nFirst, find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need an initial guess for the critical point. Since we are looking for the minimum value in the interval [0, 5], we can start with an initial guess of x_0 = 2.5.\n\nNow, we will apply Newton's method until we reach the desired accuracy of three decimal places:\n\n1. x_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0) = 2.5 - (3(2.5)^2 - 12(2.5) + 9) / (6(2.5) - 12) = 2.5 - (-1.5) / 3 = 3\n2. x_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1) = 3 - (3(3)^2 - 12(3) + 9) / (6(3) - 12) = 3 - 0 = 3\n\nSince x_2 = x_1, we have reached the desired accuracy, and the critical point is x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. We can do this by checking the second derivative at x = 3:\n\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 18 - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point at x = 3 is a minimum.\n\nFinally, we can find the minimum value of f(x) by plugging x = 3 back into the original function:\n\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 12 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 12 = 12\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) in the interval [0, 5] is 12, and it occurs at x = 3."
