    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the cable used to form the circle and (100 - x) be the length used to form the square. We want to maximize the combined area of the circle and square.\n\nThe circumference of the circle is x, so its radius r can be calculated as:\nr = x / (2 * π)\n\nThe area of the circle A_circle is:\nA_circle = π * r^2 = π * (x / (2 * π))^2 = (x^2) / (4 * π)\n\nThe perimeter of the square is (100 - x), so its side length s can be calculated as:\ns = (100 - x) / 4\n\nThe area of the square A_square is:\nA_square = s^2 = ((100 - x) / 4)^2 = (100 - x)^2 / 16\n\nThe combined area A_total is:\nA_total = A_circle + A_square = (x^2) / (4 * π) + (100 - x)^2 / 16\n\nTo find the maximum combined area, we can take the derivative of A_total with respect to x and set it to 0:\ndA_total/dx = (2 * x) / (4 * π) - 2 * (100 - x) / 16 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\nx / (2 * π) = (100 - x) / 8\n\nMultiplying both sides by 8 * 2 * π:\n8 * x = 2 * π * (100 - x)\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n4 * x = π * (100 - x)\n\nAdding x to both sides:\n5 * x = 100 * π\n\nDividing both sides by 5:\nx = 20 * π\n\nSo, the length of the cable used to form the circle is 20 * π meters. The length of the cable used to form the square is 100 - 20 * π meters.\n\nApproximately, x ≈ 62.83 meters (for the circle) and 100 - x ≈ 37.17 meters (for the square)."
