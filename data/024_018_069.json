    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,0,1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's find the first fundamental form:\nru = ∂r/∂u = (2u, 1, -2ue^(-u^2-v^2))\nrv = ∂r/∂v = (2v, 0, -2ve^(-u^2-v^2))\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = <ru, ru> = (2u)^2 + 1^2 + (-2ue^(-u^2-v^2))^2\nF = <ru, rv> = (2u)(2v) + 0 + (-2ue^(-u^2-v^2))(-2ve^(-u^2-v^2))\nG = <rv, rv> = (2v)^2 + 0 + (-2ve^(-u^2-v^2))^2\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form:\nruu = ∂²r/∂u² = (2, 0, 2u(2u^2+2v^2-1)e^(-u^2-v^2))\nruv = ∂²r/∂u∂v = (0, 0, 4uve^(-u^2-v^2))\nrvv = ∂²r/∂v² = (2, 0, 2v(2u^2+2v^2-1)e^(-u^2-v^2))\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\nL = <ruu, N> = 2u(2u^2+2v^2-1)e^(-u^2-v^2)\nM = <ruv, N> = 4uve^(-u^2-v^2)\nN = <rvv, N> = 2v(2u^2+2v^2-1)e^(-u^2-v^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nNow, let's compute the sectional curvature at the point (1,0,1):\nE(1,0) = 4 + 1 + 0 = 5\nF(1,0) = 0\nG(1,0) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\nL(1,0) = 0\nM(1,0) = 0\nN(1,0) = 0\n\nSince G = N = 0, the sectional curvature is not defined at the point (1,0,1)."
