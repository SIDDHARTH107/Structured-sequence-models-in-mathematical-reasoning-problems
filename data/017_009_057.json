    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 9, we know that the order of G is a power of a prime number (9 = 3^2). According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, G can be either isomorphic to C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3).\n\nHowever, we can rule out the possibility of G being isomorphic to C3 × C3. The reason is that the non-abelian group of order 9 does not exist. A group of order p^2, where p is a prime number, is always abelian. This can be shown using the class equation:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nwhere |G| is the order of the group, |Z(G)| is the order of the center of the group, and the sum is taken over the distinct conjugacy classes C(x) of non-central elements x in G.\n\nSince |G| = 9, the possible orders of the center of the group are 1, 3, and 9. If |Z(G)| = 1, then G would be non-abelian, but this is not possible because the class equation would become 9 = 1 + ∑[G:C(x)], and the sum of the orders of the conjugacy classes must divide 9, which is not possible with a summand of 1.\n\nIf |Z(G)| = 3, then G would also be non-abelian, but this is not possible either because a group of order 9 cannot have a proper subgroup of order 3 (Lagrange's theorem states that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group, and 3 does not divide 9).\n\nTherefore, the only possibility left is that |Z(G)| = 9, which means that G is abelian and isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
