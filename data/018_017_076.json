    "message_1": "Consider the sets A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {2, 4}. Let C = {2, 3}. Find the following two sets: (A × B) Δ C and A × (B Δ C), where \"×\" represents the Cartesian product and \"Δ\" represents the symmetric difference operation. Show that they are not equal and hence prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A × B and C, denoted as (A × B) Δ C:\n\n(A × B) Δ C = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4)}\n\nThis is because none of the elements in C are present in A × B, so the symmetric difference is just the union of the two sets.\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C, denoted as B Δ C:\n\nB Δ C = {2, 4} Δ {2, 3} = {3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and the symmetric difference of B and C, denoted as A × (B Δ C):\n\nA × (B Δ C) = A × {3, 4} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets (A × B) Δ C and A × (B Δ C):\n\n(A × B) Δ C = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4)}\nA × (B Δ C) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, the two sets are not equal. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
