    "message_2": "To find the probability of both teams scoring a goal in the same match, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each team scoring a goal.\n\nProbability of Chelsea scoring a goal = 0.26\nProbability of Manchester United scoring a goal = 0.34\n\nProbability of both teams scoring a goal = (Probability of Chelsea scoring a goal) * (Probability of Manchester United scoring a goal)\n= 0.26 * 0.34\n= 0.0884\n\nSo, the probability of both teams scoring a goal in the same match is 0.0884 or 8.84%."
