    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A is given $100 and must offer a portion of it to Player B. If Player B accepts the offer, each player keeps their share. If Player B rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. What is the lowest amount that Player A should offer to ensure that Player B accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "In an Ultimatum Game, the lowest amount that Player A should offer to ensure that Player B accepts the offer is $1. This is because if Player B rejects the offer, they will get nothing, so accepting $1 is still better than getting nothing at all. However, this is assuming that Player B is acting rationally and purely based on monetary gain. In reality, people may have different preferences and may reject offers they perceive as unfair, even if it means getting nothing."
