    "message_2": "If 80% of the 500 people own a car, then 20% of them do not own a car. To find the probability that a randomly chosen person does not own a car, we can calculate the percentage of people who do not own a car.\n\nNumber of people who do not own a car = 20% of 500 = 0.20 * 500 = 100 people\n\nProbability that a randomly chosen person does not own a car = Number of people who do not own a car / Total number of people in the community\n\nProbability = 100 / 500 = 0.20 or 20%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen person in the community does not own a car is 20%."
