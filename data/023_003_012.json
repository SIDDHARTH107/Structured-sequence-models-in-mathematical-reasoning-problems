    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using Fourier series, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients for the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(2πx). Since the given function is already a sine function, we can write it as a Fourier sine series:\n\nu(x, 0) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx)], where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nIn this case, B_1 = 1 and B_n = 0 for n ≠ 1. Now, we assume the solution of the PDE to be in the form:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [b_n(t) * sin(nπx)], where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nTaking the first and second partial derivatives with respect to t and x, we get:\n\n∂u/∂t = Σ [db_n(t)/dt * sin(nπx)]\n\n∂^2u/∂x^2 = Σ [-n^2π^2 * b_n(t) * sin(nπx)]\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the given PDE:\n\nΣ [db_n(t)/dt * sin(nπx)] = k * Σ [-n^2π^2 * b_n(t) * sin(nπx)]\n\nSince the sine functions are linearly independent, we can equate the coefficients of the sine functions:\n\ndb_n(t)/dt = -k * n^2π^2 * b_n(t)\n\nThis is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for b_n(t). We can solve it using separation of variables:\n\ndb_n(t) / b_n(t) = -k * n^2π^2 * dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(b_n(t)) = -k * n^2π^2 * t + C_n\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides:\n\nb_n(t) = e^(-k * n^2π^2 * t) * e^(C_n)\n\nSince b_n(0) = B_n, we have:\n\nB_n = e^(C_n)\n\nThus, b_n(t) = B_n * e^(-k * n^2π^2 * t)\n\nNow, we substitute the Fourier coefficients B_n back into the solution:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [B_n * e^(-k * n^2π^2 * t) * sin(nπx)]\n\nSince B_1 = 1 and B_n = 0 for n ≠ 1, the solution simplifies to:\n\nu(x, t) = e^(-k * π^2 * t) * sin(πx)\n\nSo, the solution of the given PDE for x in the range [0, 1] and t in the range [0, 1] is:\n\nu(x, t) = e^(-0.1 * π^2 * t) * sin(πx)"
