    "message_1": "A bakery wants to test whether increasing the amount of sugar in their cookie recipe will result in a significant increase in sales. They randomly divide their customers into two equal groups and give one group regular cookies and the other group cookies with increased sugar. After one week, they record the number of cookies sold by each group. Based on the data, can you determine whether increasing the amount of sugar in the cookie recipe resulted in a significant increase in sales? Use a significance level of 0.05. \n\nGroup 1 (regular cookies): 150 cookies sold\nGroup 2 (increased sugar cookies): 190 cookies sold",
    "message_2": "To determine whether increasing the amount of sugar in the cookie recipe resulted in a significant increase in sales, we can perform a hypothesis test using the data provided.\n\nLet's define the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1):\nH0: There is no significant difference in sales between the regular cookies and the increased sugar cookies.\nH1: There is a significant difference in sales between the regular cookies and the increased sugar cookies.\n\nWe will perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two groups. First, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each group:\n\nGroup 1 (regular cookies):\nMean1 = 150 cookies sold\nStandard deviation1 (SD1) is not provided, so we cannot proceed with the t-test.\n\nGroup 2 (increased sugar cookies):\nMean2 = 190 cookies sold\nStandard deviation2 (SD2) is not provided, so we cannot proceed with the t-test.\n\nWithout the standard deviations for each group, we cannot perform a two-sample t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in sales between the regular cookies and the increased sugar cookies. If the standard deviations were provided, we could calculate the t-value and compare it to the critical t-value at a 0.05 significance level to determine if we should reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis."
