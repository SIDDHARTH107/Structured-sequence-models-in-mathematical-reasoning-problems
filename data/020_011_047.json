    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of toys, type A and type B, that require the use of two machines, machines X and Y. Type A toys require 4 hours on machine X and 3 hours on machine Y to produce, while type B toys require 6 hours on machine X and 2 hours on machine Y to produce. The company has a machine X time limit of 100 hours per week and a machine Y time limit of 50 hours per week. If the profit from type A toys is $5 per toy and the profit from type B toys is $10 per toy, how many of each type of toy should the company produce in a week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A toys and y be the number of type B toys produced in a week. We have the following constraints:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 100 (machine X time limit)\n3x + 2y ≤ 50 (machine Y time limit)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negative production quantities)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 10y.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. 4x + 6y ≤ 100\ny ≤ (100 - 4x) / 6\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 50\ny ≤ (50 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1.

Intersection of constraint 2 and y-axis (x = 0):\n3 * 0 + 2y ≤ 50\ny = 25\n\nVertex 3: (0, 25)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(10, 5) = 5 * 10 + 10 * 5 = 100\nP(25, 0) = 5 * 25 + 10 * 0 = 125\nP(0, 25) = 5 * 0 + 10 * 25 = 250\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (0, 25), with a profit of $250. Therefore, the company should produce 0 type A toys and 25 type B toys in a week to maximize their profit."
