    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the polynomial equation y = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 3, we need to find the values of x when y = 0. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\n0 = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 3\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be quite challenging. In this case, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (3) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (2).\n\nFactors of 3: ±1, ±3\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±3, ±1/2, ±3/2\n\nNow, we can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\nFor x = 1:\n0 = 2(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 4(1) + 3\n0 = 2 - 6 + 4 + 3\n0 ≠ 3\n\nFor x = -1:\n0 = 2(-1)^3 - 6(-1)^2 + 4(-1) + 3\n0 = -2 - 6 - 4 + 3\n0 ≠ -9\n\nFor x = 3:\n0 = 2(3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 4(3) + 3\n0 = 54 - 54 + 12 + 3\n0 ≠ 15\n\nFor x = -3:\n0 = 2(-3)^3 - 6(-3)^2 + 4(-3) + 3\n0 = -54 - 54 - 12 + 3\n0 ≠ -117\n\nFor x = 1/2:\n0 = 2(1/2)^3 - 6(1/2)^2 + 4(1/2) + 3\n0 = 1/2 - 3/2 + 2 + 3\n0 = 3\n\nFor x = -1/2:\n0 = 2(-1/2)^3 - 6(-1/2)^2 + 4(-1/2) + 3\n0 = -1/2 - 3/2 - 2 + 3\n0 ≠ -1\n\nFor x = 3/2:\n0 = 2(3/2)^3 - 6(3/2)^2 + 4(3/2) + 3\n0 = 27/2 - 27/2 + 6 + 3\n0 ≠ 9\n\nFor x = -3/2:\n0 = 2(-3/2)^3 - 6(-3/2)^2 + 4(-3/2) + 3\n0 = -27/2 - 27/2 - 6 + 3\n0 ≠ -57/2\n\nNone of the possible rational roots are actual roots of the polynomial. This means that the polynomial equation has no rational roots. The roots are either irrational or complex numbers. To find these roots, we would need to use numerical methods or software tools like Wolfram Alpha or a graphing calculator.\n\nTo graph the solution set on a coordinate plane, we can plot the function y = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 3. The graph will show the behavior of the function, but it will not provide the exact roots since they are not rational numbers. You can use graphing software or a graphing calculator to plot the function and visualize the graph."
