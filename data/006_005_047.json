    "message_1": "A factory produces 10000 units of a product every day. The probability of a defective unit is 0.05. What is the probability of producing at least 450 defective units in a week (7 days)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. However, since the number of trials (n) is large (70,000 units produced in a week), we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) for the binomial distribution:\n\nMean (μ) = n * p = 70,000 * 0.05 = 3500\nVariance = n * p * (1-p) = 70,000 * 0.05 * (1-0.05) = 3325\nStandard deviation (σ) = √Variance = √3325 ≈ 57.7\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of producing at least 450 defective units in a week, which means producing 3950 or more defective units (since the mean is 3500). We can use the z-score formula to find the z-score for 3950:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ = (3950 - 3500) / 57.7 ≈ 7.8\n\nNow, we can use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability of getting a z-score of 7.8 or higher. This probability is extremely close to 1 (almost 100%), as a z-score of 7.8 is very far to the right of the mean in a normal distribution.\n\nSo, the probability of producing at least 450 defective units in a week is almost 100%."
