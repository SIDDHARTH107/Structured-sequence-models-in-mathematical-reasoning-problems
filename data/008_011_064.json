    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix, which we'll call D. The coefficient matrix is:\n\n| 3  2 |\n| 2 -3 |\n\nD = (3 * -3) - (2 * 2) = -9 - 4 = -13\n\nNow, we'll find the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns of the coefficient matrix with the constant terms of the equations. We'll call these determinants Dx and Dy.\n\nFor Dx, replace the first column of the coefficient matrix with the constant terms:\n\n| 8  2 |\n| -1 -3 |\n\nDx = (8 * -3) - (2 * -1) = -24 + 2 = -22\n\nFor Dy, replace the second column of the coefficient matrix with the constant terms:\n\n| 3  8 |\n| 2 -1 |\n\nDy = (3 * -1) - (2 * 8) = -3 - 16 = -19\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = Dx / D = -22 / -13 = 22/13\ny = Dy / D = -19 / -13 = 19/13\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 22/13\ny = 19/13"
