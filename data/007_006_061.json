    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 256 and 64 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (256) by the smaller number (64) and find the remainder.\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder.\n\nStep 1:\n256 รท 64 = 4 with a remainder of 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, we don't need to proceed further. The GCD of 256 and 64 is 64."
