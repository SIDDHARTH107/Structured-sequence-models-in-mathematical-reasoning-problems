    "message_2": "To calculate the Gaussian curvature of the surface defined by z = 2sin(x)cos(y), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms. Let's denote the surface as S(x, y) = (x, y, 2sin(x)cos(y)). \n\nCompute the partial derivatives of S with respect to x and y:\nS_x = (∂S/∂x) = (1, 0, 2cos(x)cos(y))\nS_y = (∂S/∂y) = (0, 1, -2sin(x)sin(y))\n\nNow, compute the first fundamental form (E, F, G):\nE = <S_x, S_x> = 1 + 4cos^2(x)cos^2(y)\nF = <S_x, S_y> = 4cos(x)sin(x)cos(y)sin(y)\nG = <S_y, S_y> = 1 + 4sin^2(x)sin^2(y)\n\nNext, compute the second partial derivatives of S:\nS_xx = (∂²S/∂x²) = (0, 0, -4sin(x)cos(y))\nS_yy = (∂²S/∂y²) = (0, 0, -4sin(x)cos(y))\nS_xy = (∂²S/∂x∂y) = (0, 0, -4cos(x)sin(x)sin(y)cos(y))\n\nNow, compute the second fundamental form (L, M, N):\nL = <S_xx, N> = -4sin(x)cos(y)\nM = <S_xy, N> = 4cos(x)sin(x)sin(y)cos(y)\nN = <S_yy, N> = -4sin(x)cos(y)\n\nFinally, compute the Gaussian curvature K:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = ((-4sin(x)cos(y))(-4sin(x)cos(y)) - (4cos(x)sin(x)sin(y)cos(y))^2) / ((1 + 4cos^2(x)cos^2(y))(1 + 4sin^2(x)sin^2(y)) - (4cos(x)sin(x)cos(y)sin(y))^2)\n\nK = (16sin^2(x)cos^2(y) - 16cos^2(x)sin^2(x)sin^2(y)cos^2(y)) / (1 + 8cos^2(x)cos^2(y) + 16cos^4(x)cos^4(y) + 8sin^2(x)sin^2(y) + 16sin^4(x)sin^4(y) - 16cos^2(x)sin^2(x)cos^2(y)sin^2(y))\n\nK = (16sin^2(x)cos^2(y)(1 - cos^2(x)sin^2(y))) / (1 + 8cos^2(x)cos^2(y) + 16cos^4(x)cos^4(y) + 8sin^2(x)sin^2(y) + 16sin^4(x)sin^4(y) - 16cos^2(x)sin^2(x)cos^2(y)sin^2(y))\n\nThe Gaussian curvature K is a function of x and y, and it varies over the surface. There is no \"total\" Gaussian curvature for the entire surface, as it is not a closed surface. However, we have found the expression for the Gaussian curvature at any point (x, y) on the surface."
