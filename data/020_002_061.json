    "message_1": "A toy manufacturer wants to maximize their profit by producing two types of toys, Teddy Bears and Dolls. The manufacturing cost of one Teddy Bear is $6 and one Doll is $8. The selling prices for Teddy Bear and Doll are $14 and $18 respectively. Due to limited resources, the manufacturer can produce only up to 200 toys per week. Also, the total production of Teddy Bears and Dolls cannot exceed 150 units. How many units of each type of toy should the manufacturer produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Teddy Bears and y be the number of Dolls produced.\n\nThe profit for each Teddy Bear is $14 - $6 = $8, and the profit for each Doll is $18 - $8 = $10.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit: P(x, y) = 8x + 10y.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 150 (total production of Teddy Bears and Dolls cannot exceed 150 units)\n2. x ≥ 0 (non-negative Teddy Bears)\n3. y ≥ 0 (non-negative Dolls)\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will use the graphical method. We will graph the constraints and find the feasible region. Then, we will find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. x + y = 150\n   y = 150 - x\n\nThe feasible region is the area below the line y = 150 - x, including the axes x = 0 and y = 0.\n\nVertices of the feasible region are:\n\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (0, 150)\nC. (150, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P(x, y) = 8x + 10y at each vertex:\n\nA. P(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = 0\nB. P(0, 150) = 8(0) + 10(150) = 1500\nC. P(150, 0) = 8(150) + 10(0) = 1200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B, where the manufacturer should produce 0 Teddy Bears and 150 Dolls. The maximum profit will be $1500 per week."
