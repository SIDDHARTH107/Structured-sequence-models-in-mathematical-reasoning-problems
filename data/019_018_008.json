    "message_2": "Let's consider two even numbers, A and B. By definition, an even number can be represented as 2n, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, we can write A = 2m and B = 2n, where m and n are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of A and B:\n\nA + B = 2m + 2n\n\nWe can factor out the common factor of 2:\n\nA + B = 2(m + n)\n\nSince the sum of two integers (m and n) is also an integer, let's represent the sum as a new integer, k:\n\nA + B = 2k\n\nHere, k = m + n, and k is an integer because the sum of two integers is always an integer.\n\nThus, the sum of any two even numbers, A and B, can be represented as 2k, where k is an integer. This confirms that the sum of any two even numbers is also an even number."
