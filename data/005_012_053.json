    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to test the quality of a new clothing fabric. They take a sample of 50 pieces of the fabric from the production line and measure the thickness of each piece in millimeters. The sample has a mean thickness of 2.9mm and a standard deviation of 0.4mm. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean thickness of the fabric?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean thickness of the fabric, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Z-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nGiven:\nMean (x̄) = 2.9 mm\nStandard Deviation (σ) = 0.4 mm\nSample Size (n) = 50\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.9 ± (1.96 * (0.4 / √50))\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.9 ± (1.96 * (0.4 / 7.071))\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.9 ± (1.96 * 0.0566)\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.9 ± 0.111\n\nLower Limit = 2.9 - 0.111 = 2.789 mm\nUpper Limit = 2.9 + 0.111 = 3.011 mm\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean thickness of the fabric is (2.789 mm, 3.011 mm)."
