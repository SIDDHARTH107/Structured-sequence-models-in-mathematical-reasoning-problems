    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B which require labor and machine resources. The production of A requires 4 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time and yields a profit of $30. The production of B requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time and yields a profit of $20. There are 120 hours of labor and 90 hours of machine time available. What is the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's profit? Use Harmony Search Algorithm to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Harmony Search Algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the problem parameters:\n   - Number of decision variables: 2 (x1 = number of product A, x2 = number of product B)\n   - Objective function: Maximize profit (30x1 + 20x2)\n   - Constraints: 4x1 + 3x2 ≤ 120 (labor constraint) and 3x1 + 2x2 ≤ 90 (machine constraint)\n   - Harmony memory size (HMS): 10 (number of solutions in the harmony memory)\n   - Harmony memory considering rate (HMCR): 0.8 (probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory)\n   - Pitch adjusting rate (PAR): 0.3 (probability of adjusting a selected value)\n   - Number of iterations: 1000 (or any other stopping criterion)\n\n2. Initialize the harmony memory with random feasible solutions:\n   - Generate 10 random solutions (x1, x2) that satisfy the constraints and store them in the harmony memory.\n\n3. Repeat the following steps for the specified number of iterations:\n   a. Create a new harmony vector by selecting values for x1 and x2:\n      - For each decision variable, generate a random number between 0 and 1.\n      - If the random number is less than HMCR, select a value from the harmony memory for that variable.\n      - If the random number is greater than or equal to HMCR, generate a new random value for that variable.\n   b. Apply pitch adjustment to the new harmony vector:\n      - For each decision variable, generate a random number between 0 and 1.\n      - If the random number is less than PAR, adjust the value of that variable by adding or subtracting a small random amount.\n   c. Check if the new harmony vector satisfies the constraints:\n      - If it does not satisfy the constraints, discard the vector and go back to step 3a.\n   d. Evaluate the objective function for the new harmony vector.\n   e. Update the harmony memory:\n      - If the new harmony vector has a better objective function value than the worst solution in the harmony memory, replace the worst solution with the new harmony vector.\n\n4. After the specified number of iterations, the best solution in the harmony memory is the optimal production plan.\n\nBy following these steps, the Harmony Search Algorithm will find the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's profit. Note that the algorithm is a metaheuristic, and the quality of the solution depends on the parameter settings and the number of iterations."
