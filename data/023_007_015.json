    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of a 100 Hz square wave, we first need to determine the period T. Since the frequency is 100 Hz, the period T is the reciprocal of the frequency:\n\nT = 1/f = 1/100 = 0.01 seconds\n\nNow, we can express the square wave function as:\n\nf(t) = square(2πt/T)\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a periodic function f(t) with period T is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(nωt) + bn * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, and the coefficients a0, an, and bn are given by:\n\na0 = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * 1] dt over one period\nan = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * cos(nωt)] dt over one period\nbn = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt)] dt over one period\n\nFor a square wave, the function f(t) is odd, meaning f(-t) = -f(t). This implies that all the cosine terms in the Fourier series will be zero, and we only need to calculate the sine coefficients bn.\n\nSince the square wave has a value of 1 for half of the period and -1 for the other half, we can calculate bn as follows:\n\nbn = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt)] dt over one period\n   = (2/0.01) * [∫(1 * sin(nωt) dt from 0 to T/2) + ∫(-1 * sin(nωt) dt from T/2 to T)]\n\nEvaluating the integrals, we get:\n\nbn = 200 * [(1/nπ) * (1 - cos(nπ))]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of the 100 Hz square wave as:\n\nf(t) = Σ[(200/nπ) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere the summation is over all odd integers n (n = 1, 3, 5, ...), and ω = 2π/T = 2π/0.01 = 200π rad/s."
