    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The demand for each product is uncertain and follows a normal distribution with a mean of 500 units and a standard deviation of 100 units. The production cost for Product A is $5 per unit, and for Product B is $8 per unit. The company wants to determine the production quantity of each product that maximizes its profit while taking demand uncertainty into account. \n\nWhat is the optimal production quantity of Product A and Product B that maximizes the profit of the company, assuming that the selling price for each unit of Product A and Product B is $12 and $16, respectively?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production quantity for each product, we need to calculate the profit for each product and then find the production quantity that maximizes the profit.\n\nLet's denote the production quantity for Product A as x and for Product B as y.\n\nProfit for Product A = (Selling Price - Production Cost) * Quantity Sold\nProfit for Product A = ($12 - $5) * x = $7x\n\nProfit for Product B = (Selling Price - Production Cost) * Quantity Sold\nProfit for Product B = ($16 - $8) * y = $8y\n\nTotal Profit = Profit for Product A + Profit for Product B\nTotal Profit = $7x + $8y\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the total profit while considering the demand uncertainty. Since the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 500 units and a standard deviation of 100 units, we can use the concept of service level to determine the optimal production quantity.\n\nA common service level used in inventory management is 95%, which means that the company wants to have enough inventory to satisfy 95% of the demand. Using the standard normal distribution table (Z-table), we can find the Z-value corresponding to a 95% service level, which is approximately 1.645.\n\nNow, we can calculate the optimal production quantity for each product using the following formula:\n\nOptimal Production Quantity = Mean Demand + (Z-value * Standard Deviation)\n\nOptimal Production Quantity for Product A = 500 + (1.645 * 100) = 500 + 164.5 = 664.5 ≈ 665 units\nOptimal Production Quantity for Product B = 500 + (1.645 * 100) = 500 + 164.5 = 664.5 ≈ 665 units\n\nSo, the optimal production quantity for Product A and Product B that maximizes the profit of the company is approximately 665 units each."
