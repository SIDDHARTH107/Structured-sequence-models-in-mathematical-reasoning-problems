    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial (coin flip), which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips), which is 10 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want, which is 4 in this case\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 4) = (10C4) * (0.5^4) * (0.5^(10-4))\n\nFirst, let's calculate 10C4:\n\n10C4 = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n     = 10! / (4!6!)\n     = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1)\n     = 210\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = 210 * (0.5^4) * (0.5^6)\n         = 210 * 0.0625 * 0.015625\n         = 210 * 0.0009765625\n         â‰ˆ 0.205078125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 10 coin flips is approximately 0.2051, or 20.51%."
