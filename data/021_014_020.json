    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA manufacturing company wants to find the optimal combination of two raw materials, x and y, to produce a new material that meets certain quality standards. The cost per unit of x is $5 and the cost per unit of y is $8. The company wants to minimize the cost of the new material while meeting the following conditions:\n\n- The concentration of x in the new material should be between 20% and 50%.\n- The concentration of y in the new material should be between 30% and 60%.\n- The new material should have a minimum yield of 80%.\n\nUse a genetic algorithm to find the optimal combination of x and y that satisfies these conditions and minimizes the cost per unit of the new material. Assume that the company needs to produce 1000 units of the new material.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using a genetic algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function.\n2. Initialize the population.\n3. Perform selection.\n4. Perform crossover.\n5. Perform mutation.\n6. Evaluate the fitness of the new population.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function\nThe objective function is to minimize the cost per unit of the new material while meeting the given conditions. The cost function can be defined as:\n\nCost = (x * 5) + (y * 8)\n\nStep 2: Initialize the population\nCreate an initial population of possible solutions (chromosomes) for the problem. Each chromosome represents a combination of x and y values. For example, we can start with a population of 100 chromosomes.\n\nStep 3: Perform selection\nEvaluate the fitness of each chromosome in the population based on the objective function. Select the best chromosomes to form a mating pool. We can use a selection method like tournament selection or roulette wheel selection.\n\nStep 4: Perform crossover\nCreate new chromosomes (offspring) by combining the genes of the selected parents. We can use a crossover method like single-point or uniform crossover.\n\nStep 5: Perform mutation\nIntroduce small random changes in the offspring's genes to maintain diversity in the population. We can use a mutation method like bit-flip or swap mutation.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the fitness of the new population\nEvaluate the fitness of the offspring and replace the old population with the new one.\n\nStep 7: Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met\nContinue the process of selection, crossover, mutation, and evaluation until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level.\n\nAfter running the genetic algorithm, we will obtain the optimal combination of x and y that minimizes the cost per unit of the new material while meeting the given conditions. The company can then use this combination to produce the required 1000 units of the new material."
