    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 10 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (10 cm)²\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 100 cm²\n\nSurface Area = 400 * π cm²\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 400 * 3.14159 cm²\n\nSurface Area ≈ 1256.64 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 10 cm is approximately 1256.64 cm²."
