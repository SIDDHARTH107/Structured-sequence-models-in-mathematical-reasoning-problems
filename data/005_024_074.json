    "message_1": "In a study of 100 students, the average score in a math test was 80 with a standard deviation of 10. How many students scored above 90?",
    "message_2": "We cannot determine the exact number of students who scored above 90 with the given information. However, we can use the normal distribution to estimate the proportion of students who scored above 90.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere z is the z-score, X is the raw score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nWe want to find the proportion of students who scored above 90, so we will calculate the z-score for X = 90:\n\nz = (90 - 80) / 10\nz = 10 / 10\nz = 1\n\nNow, we will use a z-table or calculator to find the area to the right of z = 1. The area to the right of z = 1 is approximately 0.1587. This means that approximately 15.87% of students scored above 90.\n\nTo estimate the number of students who scored above 90, we can multiply the proportion by the total number of students:\n\nNumber of students above 90 ≈ 0.1587 * 100\nNumber of students above 90 ≈ 15.87\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a student, we can round the number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, approximately 16 students scored above 90."
