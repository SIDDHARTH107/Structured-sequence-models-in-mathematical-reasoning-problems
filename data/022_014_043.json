If f(z) is also harmonic in D (i.e. ∆u(x,y) = 0 and ∆v(x,y) = 0), then show that f(z) is a constant function in D. \n\nNow, suppose that f(z) is a non-constant complex-valued harmonic function on a simply connected domain D in the complex plane. If the maximum and minimum values of the real part of f(z) on D are equal to 1 and -1 respectively, find the maximum and minimum values of the modulus of f(z) on D.",
    "message_2": "First, let's show that f(z) is a constant function in D if it is both analytic and harmonic.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic in D, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n(1) ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n(2) ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nNow, since f(z) is harmonic, we have:\n\n(3) ∆u(x,y) = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n(4) ∆v(x,y) = ∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² = 0\n\nTaking the second partial derivatives of equations (1) and (2) with respect to x and y, respectively, we get:\n\n(5) ∂²u/∂x² = ∂²v/∂x∂y\n(6) ∂²u/∂y² = -∂²v/∂y∂x\n\nAdding equations (5) and (6), we obtain:\n\n∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nComparing this with equation (3), we see that they are the same, which means that u(x,y) is harmonic.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that v(x,y) is harmonic by taking the second partial derivatives of equations (1) and (2) with respect to y and x, respectively. Thus, both u(x,y) and v(x,y) are harmonic functions.\n\nNow, we will use the fact that a non-constant harmonic function cannot have a local maximum or minimum in its domain. Since both u(x,y) and v(x,y) are harmonic, they cannot have local maxima or minima. However, if f(z) is not constant, then either u(x,y) or v(x,y) must be non-constant, which contradicts the fact that they cannot have local maxima or minima. Therefore, f(z) must be a constant function in D.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where f(z) is a non-constant complex-valued harmonic function on a simply connected domain D, with maximum and minimum values of the real part equal to 1 and -1, respectively.\n\nLet g(z) = f(z) - f(-z). Then, g(z) is also a harmonic function, and the real part of g(z) has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of -2. By the Maximum Modulus Principle, the maximum value of the modulus of g(z) occurs on the boundary of D. Let's denote this maximum value as M.\n\nNow, consider the function h(z) = g(z)/M. The maximum value of the modulus of h(z) is 1, and h(z) is also a harmonic function. By Liouville's theorem, since h(z) is a bounded entire function, it must be constant. However, this contradicts the assumption that f(z) is non-constant. Therefore, there is no non-constant complex-valued harmonic function on a simply connected domain D with maximum and minimum values of the real part equal to 1 and -1.\n\nIn conclusion, if f(z) is both analytic and harmonic in a region D, it must be a constant function. Furthermore, there is no non-constant complex-valued harmonic function on a simply connected domain D with maximum and minimum values of the real part equal to 1 and -1, so we cannot find the maximum and minimum values of the modulus of such a function."
