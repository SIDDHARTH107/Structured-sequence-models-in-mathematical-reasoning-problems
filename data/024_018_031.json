    "message_2": "We are given the sectional curvature K' = 3, and the principal radii of curvature R_1 = 5 and R_2 = 8. We can use the formula to find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (R_1 * R_2) / (R_1^2 + R_2^2 - K')\n\nK = (5 * 8) / (5^2 + 8^2 - 3)\n\nK = (40) / (25 + 64 - 3)\n\nK = 40 / (86)\n\nK = 20 / 43\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at that specific point is 20/43."
