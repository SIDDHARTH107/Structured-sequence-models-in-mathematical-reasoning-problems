    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4x + 4) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator.\n\nThe numerator is a quadratic expression, and we can factor it as follows:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 2)(x - 2)) / (x - 2)\n\nWe can now cancel out the common factor (x - 2) in the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(x) = x - 2\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) f(x) = lim (x -> 2) (x - 2)\n\nBy direct substitution, we get:\n\nlim (x -> 2) (x - 2) = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4x + 4) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 0."
