    "message_2": "To determine if G and H are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency relationship is preserved.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of G and H:\n\nGraph G:\n- 7 vertices\n- 8 edges\n\nGraph H:\n- 6 vertices\n- 6 edges\n\nSince G has 7 vertices and H has 6 vertices, there cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices. Therefore, G and H are not isomorphic."
