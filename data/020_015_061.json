    "message_1": "A field in the shape of a right triangle has one side of length 30 meters and another side of length 40 meters. If the cost of fencing along the two sides and the hypotenuse of the triangle is $5 per meter, what is the minimum cost of fencing the field?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of fencing the field, we first need to find the length of the hypotenuse. Since the field is in the shape of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides (30 meters and 40 meters), and c is the length of the hypotenuse. \n\n30^2 + 40^2 = c^2\n900 + 1600 = c^2\n2500 = c^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = âˆš2500\nc = 50 meters\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides (30 meters, 40 meters, and 50 meters), we can find the total cost of fencing the field. The cost is $5 per meter, so we multiply the total length of the fencing by the cost per meter:\n\nTotal cost = (30 + 40 + 50) * $5\nTotal cost = 120 * $5\nTotal cost = $600\n\nThe minimum cost of fencing the field is $600."
