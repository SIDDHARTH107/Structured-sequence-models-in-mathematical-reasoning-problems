    "message_2": "To find the area of the surface S of a sphere with radius 5, we don't need to express it as a manifold and apply the classification of manifolds. Instead, we can use the formula for the surface area of a sphere, which is given by:\n\nSurface area (S) = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 5.\n\nS = 4 * π * (5^2)\nS = 4 * π * 25\nS = 100π\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with radius 5 is 100π square units."
