The mathematician uses expected utility theory with the following payoff table:\n\n| Decision | State 1 | State 2 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Produce | 100 | 50 |\n| Not Produce | 0 | 0 |\n\nIf the probability of State 1 is 0.6 and the probability of State 2 is 0.4, what decision should the company make?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best decision, we need to calculate the expected utility for each decision and choose the one with the highest expected utility.\n\nExpected utility for producing the new product:\nE(Produce) = (Probability of State 1 * Payoff in State 1) + (Probability of State 2 * Payoff in State 2)\nE(Produce) = (0.6 * 100) + (0.4 * 50)\nE(Produce) = 60 + 20\nE(Produce) = 80\n\nExpected utility for not producing the new product:\nE(Not Produce) = (Probability of State 1 * Payoff in State 1) + (Probability of State 2 * Payoff in State 2)\nE(Not Produce) = (0.6 * 0) + (0.4 * 0)\nE(Not Produce) = 0 + 0\nE(Not Produce) = 0\n\nComparing the expected utilities:\nE(Produce) = 80\nE(Not Produce) = 0\n\nSince the expected utility of producing the new product (80) is higher than the expected utility of not producing the new product (0), the company should decide to produce the new product."
