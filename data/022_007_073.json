    "message_2": "Liouville's theorem states that every bounded entire function (i.e., a function that is holomorphic on the entire complex plane and has a bounded range) must be constant.\n\nTo show that $f(z) = z^4 + 4z^3 + 6z + 9$ is not a bounded function, we will show that it is not constant and that it is entire.\n\nFirst, let's show that $f(z)$ is entire. A function is entire if it is holomorphic on the entire complex plane. Since $f(z)$ is a polynomial, it is holomorphic everywhere, and thus it is entire.\n\nNow, let's show that $f(z)$ is not constant. A function is constant if its derivative is zero everywhere. The derivative of $f(z)$ is:\n\n$f'(z) = 4z^3 + 12z^2 + 6$\n\nClearly, $f'(z)$ is not identically zero, as it is a non-constant polynomial. Therefore, $f(z)$ is not constant.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is entire and not constant, by Liouville's theorem, it cannot be a bounded function."
