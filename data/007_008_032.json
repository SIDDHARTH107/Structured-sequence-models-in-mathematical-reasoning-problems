    "message_1": "If p is a prime number and a is a non-negative integer such that a is not divisible by p, what is the remainder when a^p-1 is divided by p?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using Fermat's Little Theorem. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. In other words:\n\na^(p-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod p)\n\nSo when a^(p-1) is divided by p, the remainder is 1."
