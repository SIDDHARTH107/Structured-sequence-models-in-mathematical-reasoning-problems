    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we need to analyze the properties of G and compare them to the properties of C8, Q8, and D4.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8: This group has one generator and all its elements can be expressed as powers of the generator. It has 8 elements, and its structure is {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}, where e is the identity element and a is the generator.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8: This group has 8 elements and is a non-abelian group. Its structure is {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, where 1 is the identity element, and i, j, k are the generators satisfying the relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\n\n3. Dihedral group D4: This group represents the symmetries of a square and has 8 elements. It is also a non-abelian group. Its structure can be represented as {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where e is the identity element, r is the rotation by 90 degrees, and s is a reflection.\n\nNow, let's analyze the properties of G:\n\n- G has order 8, so it has 8 elements.\n- Since G is a group, it has an identity element and each element has an inverse.\n\nWe cannot determine which group G is isomorphic to without more information about its properties, such as whether it is abelian or non-abelian, or if it has any specific generators and relations. If G is abelian, it would be isomorphic to C8. If G is non-abelian, it could be isomorphic to either Q8 or D4, depending on its generators and relations."
