    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |2x - 3| + 4, we first need to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. The vertex occurs at the point where the expression inside the absolute value is equal to 0.\n\n2x - 3 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n2x = 3\nx = 3/2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging the x-value back into the equation:\n\ny = |2(3/2) - 3| + 4\n\ny = |3 - 3| + 4\n\ny = |0| + 4\n\ny = 0 + 4\n\ny = 4\n\nSo, the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |2x - 3| + 4 is (3/2, 4)."
