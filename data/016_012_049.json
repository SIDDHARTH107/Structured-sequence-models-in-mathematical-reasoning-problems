    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve that was first described by Giuseppe Peano in 1890. It is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a unit square. The curve is constructed iteratively, with each iteration increasing the order of the curve.\n\nFor the Peano curve, the length of the curve at each iteration (order) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nLength = (3^n) * (side length of the square) / (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the order of the curve.\n\nFor a unit square (side length = 1) and order 4, we can calculate the length as follows:\n\nLength = (3^4) * (1) / (2^4)\nLength = 81 / 16\nLength = 5.0625\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve of order 4 constructed on a unit square is 5.0625."
