    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of the two curves, we need to solve the system of equations formed by $C_1$ and $C_2$. \n\nFrom $C_2$, we have $x^2 = 1 - z^2$. Substituting this into $C_1$, we get:\n\n$(1 - z^2) + y^2 - z^2 = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$y^2 - 2z^2 = -1$\n\nNow, let's solve for $y^2$:\n\n$y^2 = 2z^2 - 1$\n\nSince $y^2$ must be non-negative, we have:\n\n$2z^2 - 1 \\geq 0$\n\nThis inequality holds when:\n\n$z^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, $z$ must be in the interval $[-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}] \\cup [\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}]$. \n\nNow, let's find the possible values of $x^2$:\n\n$x^2 = 1 - z^2 \\leq 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, $x$ must be in the interval $[-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}]$.\n\nFor each value of $z$ in the allowed intervals, there is a unique value of $y^2$ and thus two possible values of $y$ (one positive and one negative). Similarly, for each value of $x^2$, there are two possible values of $x$ (one positive and one negative). \n\nTherefore, there are a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ (counting multiplicity)."
