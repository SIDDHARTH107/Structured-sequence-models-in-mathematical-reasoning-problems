    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of a spanning tree for this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. I will use Kruskal's algorithm here.\n\nFirst, sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. (A, B) - 1\n2. (B, C) - 2\n3. (C, D) - 3\n4. (A, D) - 4\n5. (B, D) - 5\n6. (A, C) - 6\n\nNow, we will add edges to the spanning tree while ensuring that we don't create any cycles.\n\n1. Add edge (A, B) - cost 1\n2. Add edge (B, C) - cost 2\n3. Add edge (C, D) - cost 3\n\nAt this point, we have a spanning tree that includes all the vertices. Adding any more edges would create a cycle. The minimum cost of this spanning tree is the sum of the edge weights:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the minimum cost of a spanning tree for this graph is 6."
