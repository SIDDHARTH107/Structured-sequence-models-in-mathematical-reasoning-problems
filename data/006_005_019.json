    "message_1": "A factory produces 2000 toys per day, and 5% of the toys are defective. What is the probability that at most 100 toys will be defective in a given day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of toys produced), k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of defective toys), p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a toy being defective), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nIn this problem, n = 2000, p = 0.05, and we want to find the probability that at most 100 toys will be defective, which means we need to find the probability for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 100.\n\nTo find the probability that at most 100 toys will be defective, we can sum the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 100:\n\nP(X ≤ 100) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive, so we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean μ = np and variance σ^2 = np(1-p). In this case, μ = 2000 * 0.05 = 100 and σ^2 = 2000 * 0.05 * 0.95 = 95.\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) to estimate the probability. First, we need to convert the value of k = 100 to a Z-score:\n\nZ = (k - μ) / σ = (100 - 100) / √95 ≈ 0\n\nNow, we can use a Z-table or a calculator to find the probability that the Z-score is less than or equal to 0, which is the same as the probability that at most 100 toys will be defective:\n\nP(Z ≤ 0) ≈ 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that at most 100 toys will be defective in a given day is approximately 0.5 or 50%."
