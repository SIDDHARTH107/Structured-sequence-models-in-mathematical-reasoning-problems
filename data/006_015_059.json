    "message_1": "What is the probability that a network with 50 computers will experience a ransomware attack at least twice in the next six months, given that the average frequency of such attacks is 0.25 attacks per computer per month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, ransomware attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (6 months).\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of ransomware attacks for the entire network in 6 months. Since there are 50 computers and the average frequency of attacks is 0.25 attacks per computer per month, the total average number of attacks per month for the entire network is:\n\n50 computers * 0.25 attacks/computer/month = 12.5 attacks/month\n\nFor 6 months, the total average number of attacks is:\n\n12.5 attacks/month * 6 months = 75 attacks\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution formula to find the probability of having exactly k attacks in 6 months:\n\nP(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere λ is the average number of attacks (75 in this case), k is the number of attacks we want to find the probability for, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 2 attacks, so we need to find the probability of having 0 or 1 attack and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X≥2) = 1 - P(X=0) - P(X=1)\n\nUsing the Poisson distribution formula for k=0 and k=1:\n\nP(X=0) = (e^(-75) * 75^0) / 0! = e^(-75)\nP(X=1) = (e^(-75) * 75^1) / 1! = 75 * e^(-75)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of having at least 2 attacks:\n\nP(X≥2) = 1 - e^(-75) - 75 * e^(-75) ≈ 1\n\nThe probability is approximately 1, which means it is almost certain that the network will experience at least 2 ransomware attacks in the next 6 months."
