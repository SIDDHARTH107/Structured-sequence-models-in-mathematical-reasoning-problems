    "message_1": "If the mean height of a group of adults is 175 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm, what is the probability of randomly selecting an adult from this group who is taller than 190 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of randomly selecting an adult taller than 190 cm, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we're interested in (190 cm), μ is the mean (175 cm), and σ is the standard deviation (10 cm).\n\nz = (190 - 175) / 10\nz = 15 / 10\nz = 1.5\n\nNow, we look up the z-score of 1.5 in the standard normal distribution table, which gives us the probability of selecting an adult with a height less than 190 cm. The value for z = 1.5 is approximately 0.9332.\n\nSince we want the probability of selecting an adult taller than 190 cm, we need to find the complement of this probability:\n\nP(X > 190) = 1 - P(X < 190)\nP(X > 190) = 1 - 0.9332\nP(X > 190) ≈ 0.0668\n\nSo, the probability of randomly selecting an adult from this group who is taller than 190 cm is approximately 6.68%."
