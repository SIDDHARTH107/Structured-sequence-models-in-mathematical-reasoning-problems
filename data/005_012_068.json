The average height of the sampled students was found to be 165cm with a standard deviation of 5cm. Find the 99% confidence interval for the true average height of the students in the school.",
    "message_2": "To find the 99% confidence interval for the true average height of the students in the school, we will use the formula for the confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± Z * (σ / √n)\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (165 cm)\nZ = Z-score (critical value) for the desired confidence level (99%)\nσ = sample standard deviation (5 cm)\nn = sample size (50 students)\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 99% confidence interval. Using a Z-table or calculator, we find that the Z-score for a 99% confidence interval is approximately 2.576.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 165 ± 2.576 * (5 / √50)\n\nCI = 165 ± 2.576 * (5 / 7.071)\n\nCI = 165 ± 2.576 * 0.7071\n\nCI = 165 ± 1.821\n\nSo, the 99% confidence interval for the true average height of the students in the school is approximately (163.179 cm, 166.821 cm)."
