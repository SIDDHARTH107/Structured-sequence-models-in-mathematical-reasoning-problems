    "message_1": "A manufacturer is testing the quality of their product by conducting experiments using an Orthogonal Array. The array they have selected is OA(4, 3^2, 3), where 4 is the number of factors being tested, 3^2 is the number of levels per factor, and 3 is the minimum dimension required. How many experimental runs are needed to complete the test?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of experimental runs needed to complete the test, we need to look at the orthogonal array notation OA(n, s^k, t). In this case, n represents the number of factors being tested, s^k represents the number of levels per factor, and t is the minimum dimension required.\n\nFor the given orthogonal array OA(4, 3^2, 3), we have:\n\nn = 4 (number of factors)\ns^k = 3^2 = 9 (number of levels per factor)\nt = 3 (minimum dimension)\n\nThe number of experimental runs needed is equal to the number of levels per factor raised to the power of the minimum dimension, which is:\n\nExperimental runs = (number of levels per factor)^t\nExperimental runs = 9^3\nExperimental runs = 729\n\nSo, 729 experimental runs are needed to complete the test."
