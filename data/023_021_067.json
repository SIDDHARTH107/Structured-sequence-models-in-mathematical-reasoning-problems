    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to represent the 12V, 60Hz AC voltage source as a sinusoidal function. The voltage source can be represented as:\n\nV(t) = Vm * sin(2 * pi * f * t)\n\nwhere Vm is the amplitude (12V), f is the frequency (60Hz), and t is the time.\n\nNow, we can calculate the impedance of the resistor and the inductor. The impedance of the resistor is simply its resistance:\n\nZ_R = 100 ohms\n\nThe impedance of the inductor is given by:\n\nZ_L = j * ω * L\n\nwhere j is the imaginary unit, ω is the angular frequency (2 * pi * f), and L is the inductance (1mH).\n\nZ_L = j * 2 * pi * 60 * 0.001 H = j * 0.377 ohms\n\nThe total impedance of the series circuit is the sum of the individual impedances:\n\nZ_total = Z_R + Z_L = 100 + j * 0.377 ohms\n\nNow, we can use Ohm's law to find the current in the circuit:\n\nI(t) = V(t) / Z_total\n\nSince V(t) is a sinusoidal function, we can use the phasor representation of the voltage and impedance to find the phasor current:\n\nI_phasor = V_phasor / Z_total_phasor = (12V) / (100 + j * 0.377 ohms)\n\nNow, we can find the voltage across the resistor and the inductor using Ohm's law:\n\nV_R(t) = I(t) * Z_R\nV_L(t) = I(t) * Z_L\n\nUsing the phasor representation, we can write:\n\nV_R_phasor = I_phasor * Z_R\nV_L_phasor = I_phasor * Z_L\n\nNow, we can convert the phasor voltages back to the time domain using the inverse Fourier transform. However, since the input voltage is sinusoidal, the voltage across the resistor and the inductor will also be sinusoidal with the same frequency (60Hz). Therefore, we can simply find the amplitude and phase of the phasor voltages and write the time-domain expressions:\n\nV_R(t) = |V_R_phasor| * sin(2 * pi * f * t + phase(V_R_phasor))\nV_L(t) = |V_L_phasor| * sin(2 * pi * f * t + phase(V_L_phasor))\n\nBy calculating the magnitudes and phases of V_R_phasor and V_L_phasor, we can find the voltage across the resistor and the inductor as functions of time."
