    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(4² + 3²) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √((-2)² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNow, we need to find the angle between the two vectors. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B. We can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = (4 * -2) + (3 * 5) = -8 + 15 = 7\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula to find the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (7) / (5 * √29)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nθ = arccos(7 / (5 * √29))\n\nNow that we have the angle between the vectors, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * cos(arccos(7 / (5 * √29)))\n\nHowever, since we already calculated the dot product as 7, we can conclude that:\n\nA · B = 7"
