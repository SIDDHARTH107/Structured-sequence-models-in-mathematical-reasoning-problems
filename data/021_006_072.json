    "message_1": "A 2D partial differential equation is given by: \n\n∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nwith boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,y) = 0, u(L,y) = 0, u(x,0) = sin(πx/L), u(x,W) = 0\n\nUse the finite element method to solve for the steady-state solution of the equation, where L = 1 and W = 2. Use a uniformly spaced mesh of 4x4 and assume linear shape functions.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given 2D partial differential equation using the finite element method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain: Divide the domain into a 4x4 uniformly spaced mesh. Since L = 1 and W = 2, the spacing in the x-direction (Δx) is 1/4 and in the y-direction (Δy) is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\n2. Define the linear shape functions: For a 4x4 mesh, we have 16 nodes. We will use linear shape functions for each element, which can be defined as:\n\nN1(x, y) = (1 - x/Δx)(1 - y/Δy)\nN2(x, y) = (x/Δx)(1 - y/Δy)\nN3(x, y) = (x/Δx)(y/Δy)\nN4(x, y) = (1 - x/Δx)(y/Δy)\n\n3. Formulate the weak form of the equation: Multiply the given PDE by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain. Then, apply the Green's theorem to convert the second-order derivatives into first-order derivatives.\n\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and force vector: For each element, calculate the element stiffness matrix and force vector using the shape functions and their derivatives. Then, assemble these into the global stiffness matrix (K) and force vector (F).\n\n5. Apply boundary conditions: For the given boundary conditions, we have:\n\nu(0, y) = 0: Set the corresponding rows and columns of the global stiffness matrix to 0, and set the diagonal entry to 1.\n\nu(L, y) = 0: Set the corresponding rows and columns of the global stiffness matrix to 0, and set the diagonal entry to 1.\n\nu(x, 0) = sin(πx/L): Modify the force vector to account for the non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.\n\nu(x, W) = 0: Set the corresponding rows and columns of the global stiffness matrix to 0, and set the diagonal entry to 1.\n\n6. Solve the linear system: Solve the linear system Ku = F for the unknown nodal values u.\n\n7. Post-process the results: Use the nodal values and shape functions to obtain the approximate solution u(x, y) over the domain.\n\nBy following these steps, you can obtain the steady-state solution of the given 2D partial differential equation using the finite element method with a 4x4 uniformly spaced mesh and linear shape functions."
