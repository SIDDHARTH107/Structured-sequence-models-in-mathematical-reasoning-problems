    "message_1": "In a game of Nim, player A has 10 stones and player B has 12 stones. They take turns removing 1 to 4 stones from the pile. The player who takes the last stone wins. If both players play optimally, who will win the game?",
    "message_2": "To determine the winner in a game of Nim, we can use the concept of Nim-sum. The Nim-sum is the bitwise XOR of the number of stones in each pile. If the Nim-sum is non-zero at the start of a player's turn, that player has a winning strategy.\n\nLet's calculate the Nim-sum for the given piles:\n\n10 (in binary: 1010)\n12 (in binary: 1100)\nNim-sum: 0110 (which is 6 in decimal)\n\nSince the Nim-sum is non-zero (6), the player who goes first (player A) has a winning strategy if they play optimally. Therefore, player A will win the game."
