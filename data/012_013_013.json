    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G, we need to count the number of ways to color the vertices of the graph using k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nThe graph G has 5 vertices: A, B, C, D, and E. The edges are AB, AC, BC, BD, and CD. Notice that vertex E is not connected to any other vertex, so it can be any of the k colors.\n\nNow, let's focus on the subgraph formed by vertices A, B, C, and D. This subgraph is a cycle of length 4, which we can denote as C4. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length 4 is given by P_C4(k) = k(k-1)(k-2) + (k-1)^2.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of the entire graph G, denoted as P_G(k), can be obtained by multiplying the chromatic polynomial of the subgraph C4 by the number of ways to color vertex E, which is k. Therefore, the chromatic polynomial of G is:\n\nP_G(k) = k * P_C4(k) = k * [k(k-1)(k-2) + (k-1)^2].\n\nNow, we can expand and simplify the polynomial:\n\nP_G(k) = k^4 - 2k^3 + k^2 + 2k^2 - 2k = k^4 - 2k^3 + 3k^2 - 2k.\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is P_G(k) = k^4 - 2k^3 + 3k^2 - 2k."
