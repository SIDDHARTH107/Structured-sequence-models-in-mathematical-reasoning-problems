    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the entire larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nTo find the total number of individual cubes in a Menger sponge of level 5, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal cubes = (20^n) * (3^(3n))\n\nwhere n is the level of the Menger sponge.\n\nFor a level 5 Menger sponge:\n\nTotal cubes = (20^5) * (3^(3*5))\nTotal cubes = (20^5) * (3^15)\nTotal cubes = 3200000 * 14348907\nTotal cubes = 45895605760000\n\nSo, there are 45,895,605,760,000 individual cubes in a Menger sponge of level 5."
