    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of X, we first need to understand the topology of the space X obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a square. This process is also known as \"gluing\" the sides together.\n\nWhen we identify the opposite sides of a square, we obtain a space that is topologically equivalent to a torus (a doughnut shape). This is because when we glue the left and right sides of the square, we get a cylinder, and when we glue the top and bottom sides of the cylinder, we get a torus.\n\nNow, we need to compute the fundamental group of the torus. The fundamental group of a topological space is a group that captures information about the \"holes\" in the space. For the torus, we can consider two loops: one that goes around the \"hole\" in the middle (let's call this loop a) and one that goes around the \"hole\" created by the identification of the opposite sides (let's call this loop b).\n\nThe fundamental group of the torus is generated by these two loops, and their commutator (the product of a loop followed by the other loop, then the inverse of the first loop, and finally the inverse of the second loop) is trivial. This means that the fundamental group of the torus is the free abelian group on two generators, which can be written as:\n\nπ1(X) = Z × Z\n\nHere, Z represents the group of integers, and the × symbol denotes the direct product of groups. So, the fundamental group of the space X obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a square is isomorphic to the group Z × Z."
