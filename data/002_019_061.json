    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific question for the math student:\n\nWhat is the surface area of a cone with a radius of 6 cm and a slant height of 10 cm? Round your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 6 cm and l = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = π(6)(6 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(6)(16)\nSurface Area = 96π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 96 * 3.14\nSurface Area ≈ 301.44\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the surface area of the cone is approximately 301.4 square centimeters."
