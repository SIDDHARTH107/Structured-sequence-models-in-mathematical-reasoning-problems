    "message_1": "In the Public Goods Game, four players contribute anonymously to a public pool. The pool is multiplied by a factor (greater than 1) and then evenly split among the players, regardless of their contribution. Each player receives a payoff equal to their contribution plus their share of the pool. \n\nSuppose the factor is 3, and each player contributes either £2 or £4. If three players contribute £2 and one player contributes £4, what is each player's payoff in this game?",
    "message_2": "Let's first calculate the total amount in the public pool. If three players contribute £2 each and one player contributes £4, the total amount in the pool is:\n\n3 * £2 + £4 = £6 + £4 = £10\n\nNow, we multiply the pool by the factor, which is 3 in this case:\n\n£10 * 3 = £30\n\nNext, we evenly split the £30 among the four players:\n\n£30 / 4 = £7.50\n\nSo, each player receives £7.50 from the pool. Now, we need to calculate each player's payoff, which is their contribution plus their share of the pool.\n\nFor the three players who contributed £2 each, their payoff is:\n\n£2 (contribution) + £7.50 (share of the pool) = £9.50\n\nFor the player who contributed £4, their payoff is:\n\n£4 (contribution) + £7.50 (share of the pool) = £11.50\n\nIn conclusion, the three players who contributed £2 each have a payoff of £9.50, and the player who contributed £4 has a payoff of £11.50."
