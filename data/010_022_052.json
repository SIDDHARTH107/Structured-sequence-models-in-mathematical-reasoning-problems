    "message_2": "To find the maximum volume of water that can be poured into the cylindrical glass before it spills over the top, we need to calculate the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the diameter of the cylinder is 6 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 3 cm. The height (h) is given as 10 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = π(3 cm)^2(10 cm)\nV = π(9 cm^2)(10 cm)\nV = 90π cm^3\n\nThe maximum volume of water that can be poured into the glass before it spills over the top is 90π cubic centimeters, or approximately 283.53 cubic centimeters."
