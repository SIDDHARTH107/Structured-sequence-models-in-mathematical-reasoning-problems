    "message_1": "A ball is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 m/s. Using calculus, determine the maximum height the ball reaches and the time it takes to reach this height. Assume acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s².",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first need to find the position function of the ball with respect to time. We know the initial velocity (v0) is 25 m/s and the acceleration (a) due to gravity is -9.8 m/s². \n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, a(t) = -9.8 m/s².\n\nTo find the velocity function, we integrate the acceleration function with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫(-9.8) dt = -9.8t + C1\n\nWe know the initial velocity is 25 m/s, so we can find the constant C1:\n\nv(0) = 25 = -9.8(0) + C1 => C1 = 25\n\nSo, the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = -9.8t + 25\n\nNow, we integrate the velocity function to find the position function:\n\ns(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-9.8t + 25) dt = -4.9t² + 25t + C2\n\nSince the ball is thrown from the ground, the initial position is 0:\n\ns(0) = 0 = -4.9(0)² + 25(0) + C2 => C2 = 0\n\nSo, the position function is:\n\ns(t) = -4.9t² + 25t\n\nTo find the maximum height, we need to find when the velocity is 0 (the ball stops going up and starts falling down). We set the velocity function to 0 and solve for t:\n\n0 = -9.8t + 25\nt = 25 / 9.8\nt ≈ 2.551 seconds\n\nNow, we plug this time value into the position function to find the maximum height:\n\ns(2.551) = -4.9(2.551)² + 25(2.551)\ns(2.551) ≈ 32.398 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height the ball reaches is approximately 32.398 meters, and it takes about 2.551 seconds to reach this height."
