    "message_1": "A bakery claims that on average, 10% of their chocolate chip cookies are burnt. If a customer buys a dozen chocolate chip cookies, what is the probability that at least one cookie is burnt?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one cookie is burnt, we can first find the probability that none of the cookies are burnt and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single cookie is not burnt is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 (since 10% are burnt, 90% are not burnt).\n\nSince the customer buys a dozen cookies, we need to find the probability that all 12 cookies are not burnt. We assume that the probability of each cookie being burnt or not is independent of the others.\n\nThe probability that all 12 cookies are not burnt is (0.90)^12 ≈ 0.2824.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one cookie is burnt:\n\n1 - 0.2824 ≈ 0.7176.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one cookie is burnt is approximately 71.76%."
