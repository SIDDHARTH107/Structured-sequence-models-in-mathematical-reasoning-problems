    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow we can find the sets (A × B) ∩ A and A × (B ∩ A):\n\n1. (A × B) ∩ A:\n\nSince A contains only single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty:\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅\n\n2. A × (B ∩ A):\n\nWe already found the intersection of A and B, which is {2, 3}. Now we find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∩ A):\n\nA × (B ∩ A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nNow we can compare the two sets:\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅\nA × (B ∩ A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nSince these two sets are not equal, we have shown that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
