    "message_1": "The probability of a workplace accident due to slipping on the floor is 0.05. If there are 50 employees working in the company, what is the probability that at least 3 employees will experience this type of accident within a year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, k accidents) in n trials (in this case, n employees)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an accident, 0.05)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of employees, 50)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of accidents)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 3 accidents, we need to find the probability of 3, 4, 5, ..., 50 accidents and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 accidents and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X=0) = C(50, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(50-0)\nP(X=1) = C(50, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(50-1)\nP(X=2) = C(50, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (1-0.05)^(50-2)\n\nCalculate these probabilities:\n\nP(X=0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^50 ≈ 0.000000002\nP(X=1) = 50 * 0.05 * (0.95)^49 ≈ 0.000000104\nP(X=2) = 1225 * 0.0025 * (0.95)^48 ≈ 0.00000271\n\nNow, sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X=0 or X=1 or X=2) = 0.000000002 + 0.000000104 + 0.00000271 ≈ 0.000002816\n\nFinally, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least 3 accidents:\n\nP(X≥3) = 1 - P(X=0 or X=1 or X=2) = 1 - 0.000002816 ≈ 0.999997184\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 employees will experience a slipping accident within a year is approximately 0.999997184 or 99.9997%."
