    "message_1": "A bakery needs to make a cake with a fixed weight of 1kg. The cake can be made from three different types of flour: flour A, flour B, and flour C. The cost of flour A is $2 per pound, flour B is $3 per pound, and flour C is $5 per pound. The cake must contain at least 200 grams of flour A, at least 300 grams of flour B, and at least 400 grams of flour C. What is the minimum cost of making the 1kg cake?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of making the 1kg cake, we need to convert the weight of the flours to pounds and calculate the cost of each type of flour.\n\n1 kg = 1000 grams\n1 pound = 453.592 grams\n\nMinimum flour requirements:\nFlour A: 200 grams\nFlour B: 300 grams\nFlour C: 400 grams\n\nTotal minimum flour required: 200 + 300 + 400 = 900 grams\n\nSince the cake must weigh 1 kg (1000 grams), we need an additional 100 grams of flour. To minimize the cost, we should use the cheapest flour, which is flour A.\n\nNew flour requirements:\nFlour A: 200 + 100 = 300 grams\nFlour B: 300 grams\nFlour C: 400 grams\n\nNow, let's convert the grams to pounds:\n\nFlour A: 300 grams * (1 pound / 453.592 grams) ≈ 0.661 pounds\nFlour B: 300 grams * (1 pound / 453.592 grams) ≈ 0.661 pounds\nFlour C: 400 grams * (1 pound / 453.592 grams) ≈ 0.882 pounds\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost of each type of flour:\n\nCost of Flour A: 0.661 pounds * $2 per pound ≈ $1.32\nCost of Flour B: 0.661 pounds * $3 per pound ≈ $1.98\nCost of Flour C: 0.882 pounds * $5 per pound ≈ $4.41\n\nTotal cost of making the 1kg cake: $1.32 + $1.98 + $4.41 ≈ $7.71\n\nThe minimum cost of making the 1kg cake is approximately $7.71."
