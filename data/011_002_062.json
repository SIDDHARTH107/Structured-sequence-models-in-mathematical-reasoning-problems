    "message_1": "In a group of 5 people, how many different ways can you choose 3 people to form a committee?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 3 people from a group of 5, we use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (5 in this case) and k is the number of people we want to choose (3 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\n\nC(5, 3) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 × 2)\n\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nSo there are 10 different ways to choose 3 people from a group of 5 to form a committee."
