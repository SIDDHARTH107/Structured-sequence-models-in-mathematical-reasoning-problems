    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the area of model theory:\n\nLet 𝑇 be the theory of an infinite field of characteristic 0. Give an example of a sentence 𝜙(𝑥) in the language of fields such that 𝜙(𝑥) is satisfied by all elements of the field, but does not follow logically from the theory 𝑇.",
    "message_2": "Consider the sentence 𝜙(𝑥) defined as:\n\n𝜙(𝑥) = ∀𝑦(𝑥 * 𝑦 = 𝑦 * 𝑥)\n\nThis sentence states that the multiplication operation in the field is commutative. Now, we know that all fields, including infinite fields of characteristic 0, have commutative multiplication. Therefore, 𝜙(𝑥) is satisfied by all elements of the field.\n\nHowever, 𝜙(𝑥) does not follow logically from the theory 𝑇 of an infinite field of characteristic 0. The axioms of 𝑇 include the field axioms (associativity, distributivity, existence of additive and multiplicative identities and inverses, etc.) and the axiom stating that the field has characteristic 0. While these axioms imply that the field is commutative, the commutativity of multiplication is not a direct logical consequence of the axioms of 𝑇.\n\nThus, 𝜙(𝑥) is an example of a sentence that is satisfied by all elements of the field but does not follow logically from the theory 𝑇."
