    "message_2": "We will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is analytic in a closed and bounded domain, then the maximum value of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is analytic in the closed disk $D = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: |z| \\leq 2\\}$, the Maximum Modulus Principle applies. We are given that $|f(z)| \\leq 3$ for all $z \\in D$. Therefore, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ is attained on the boundary of the disk, which is the circle $|z| = 2$.\n\nNow, we want to show that $|f(0)| \\leq 3$. Since $0$ is an interior point of the disk $D$, we know that $|f(0)|$ cannot be greater than the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary of the disk. Thus, $|f(0)| \\leq 3$, as desired."
