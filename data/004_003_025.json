    "message_1": "A cable company needs to run a cable from the street to a house located 50 meters away. The cable company charges $7 per meter for the cable running from the street to the house and $11 per meter for the cable running under the ground. \n\nWhat is the most cost-effective way for them to run the cable to the house given that they have $500 to spend?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the cable running above the ground as x meters and the length of the cable running under the ground as y meters. The total length of the cable is 50 meters, so we have:\n\nx + y = 50\n\nThe cost of the cable running above the ground is $7 per meter, and the cost of the cable running under the ground is $11 per meter. The total cost should not exceed $500, so we have:\n\n7x + 11y ≤ 500\n\nNow, we need to find the most cost-effective way to run the cable, which means minimizing the cost while still reaching the house. We can rewrite the cost equation as:\n\ny ≤ (500 - 7x) / 11\n\nSince x + y = 50, we can rewrite this equation in terms of x:\n\ny = 50 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute this equation into the inequality:\n\n50 - x ≤ (500 - 7x) / 11\n\nMultiplying both sides by 11, we get:\n\n550 - 11x ≤ 500 - 7x\n\nSolving for x, we have:\n\n4x ≥ 50\n\nx ≥ 12.5\n\nSince the cable length must be in whole meters, the minimum value for x is 13 meters. Now we can find the value of y:\n\ny = 50 - x = 50 - 13 = 37 meters\n\nSo, the most cost-effective way to run the cable is to have 13 meters of the cable running above the ground and 37 meters of the cable running under the ground. The total cost will be:\n\n(13 * $7) + (37 * $11) = $91 + $407 = $498\n\nThis solution is within the $500 budget and is the most cost-effective way to run the cable to the house."
