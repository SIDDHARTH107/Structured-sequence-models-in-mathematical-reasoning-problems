    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to divide a set of 10 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets, so we are looking for the value of S(10, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(10, 3), we need to calculate the Stirling numbers for smaller values of n and k first. We can use the following base cases:\n\nS(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0\nS(0, 0) = 1\nS(n, n) = 1 for n > 0\n\nUsing the formula and base cases, we can calculate the Stirling numbers for the required values:\n\nS(1, 1) = 1\nS(2, 1) = 1\nS(2, 2) = 1\nS(3, 1) = 1\nS(3, 2) = 3\nS(3, 3) = 1\nS(4, 1) = 1\nS(4, 2) = 7\nS(4, 3) = 6\nS(4, 4) = 1\nS(5, 1) = 1\nS(5, 2) = 15\nS(5, 3) = 25\nS(5, 4) = 10\nS(5, 5) = 1\nS(6, 1) = 1\nS(6, 2) = 31\nS(6, 3) = 90\nS(6, 4) = 65\nS(6, 5) = 15\nS(6, 6) = 1\nS(7, 1) = 1\nS(7, 2) = 63\nS(7, 3) = 301\nS(7, 4) = 350\nS(7, 5) = 140\nS(7, 6) = 21\nS(7, 7) = 1\nS(8, 1) = 1\nS(8, 2) = 127\nS(8, 3) = 966\nS(8, 4) = 1701\nS(8, 5) = 1050\nS(8, 6) = 266\nS(8, 7) = 28\nS(8, 8) = 1\nS(9, 1) = 1\nS(9, 2) = 255\nS(9, 3) = 3025\nS(9, 4) = 7770\nS(9, 5) = 6951\nS(9, 6) = 2646\nS(9, 7) = 462\nS(9, 8) = 36\nS(9, 9) = 1\n\nNow, we can find S(10, 3) using the formula:\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * S(9, 3) + S(9, 2)\nS(10, 3) = 3 * 3025 + 255\nS(10, 3) = 9075 + 255\nS(10, 3) = 9330\n\nSo, there are 9330 ways to divide a set of 10 distinct elements into 3 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
