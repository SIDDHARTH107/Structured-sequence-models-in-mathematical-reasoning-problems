The company has a budget of $100,000 and four product lines (A, B, C, and D). The production cost and profit for each product line are as follows:\n\n    - Product A: Production cost $10, Profit $20\n    - Product B: Production cost $15, Profit $25\n    - Product C: Production cost $12, Profit $18\n    - Product D: Production cost $8, Profit $12\n\nHowever, the company can only produce an integer number of each product line. How many units of each product line should the company produce to maximize its profit while staying within the budget?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the profit per dollar spent on each product line. We can calculate this by dividing the profit by the production cost for each product:\n\n- Product A: Profit per dollar = $20 / $10 = $2\n- Product B: Profit per dollar = $25 / $15 = $1.67 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n- Product C: Profit per dollar = $18 / $12 = $1.5\n- Product D: Profit per dollar = $12 / $8 = $1.5\n\nNow, we should prioritize producing the products with the highest profit per dollar spent. In this case, Product A has the highest profit per dollar, followed by Product B, and then Products C and D.\n\nLet's start by producing as many units of Product A as possible within the budget:\n\n- Maximum units of Product A: $100,000 / $10 = 10,000 units\n\nHowever, this would use up the entire budget, and we want to see if we can produce other products to increase the overall profit. Let's reduce the number of Product A units to free up some budget for other products:\n\n- 9,000 units of Product A: $90,000 spent, $10,000 remaining in the budget\n\nNow, let's produce as many units of Product B as possible with the remaining budget:\n\n- Maximum units of Product B: $10,000 / $15 ≈ 666.67 units, which we round down to 666 units (since we can only produce an integer number of units)\n\nThis leaves us with a remaining budget of $10,000 - (666 * $15) = $1,010.\n\nNow, let's produce as many units of Product C as possible with the remaining budget:\n\n- Maximum units of Product C: $1,010 / $12 ≈ 84.17 units, which we round down to 84 units\n\nThis leaves us with a remaining budget of $1,010 - (84 * $12) = $10.\n\nSince we cannot produce any more units of Product C or D with the remaining budget, this is our final production plan:\n\n- Product A: 9,000 units\n- Product B: 666 units\n- Product C: 84 units\n- Product D: 0 units\n\nThe total profit for this production plan is:\n\n- Profit from Product A: 9,000 * $20 = $180,000\n- Profit from Product B: 666 * $25 = $16,650\n- Profit from Product C: 84 * $18 = $1,512\n- Profit from Product D: 0 * $12 = $0\n\nTotal profit: $180,000 + $16,650 + $1,512 = $198,162"
