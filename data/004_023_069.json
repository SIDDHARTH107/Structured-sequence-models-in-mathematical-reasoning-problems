    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the two curves y = x² and y = 4 - x², we first need to find the points of intersection. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx² = 4 - x²\n\n2x² = 4\nx² = 2\nx = ±√2\n\nSo the points of intersection are at x = -√2 and x = √2. Now we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. The area will be the integral of the difference between the two functions from -√2 to √2:\n\nArea = ∫[-√2, √2] (4 - x² - x²) dx\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫[-√2, √2] (4 - 2x²) dx\n\nNow, integrate the function with respect to x:\n\nArea = [4x - (2/3)x³] (from -√2 to √2)\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nArea = (4√2 - (2/3)(√2)³) - (4(-√2) - (2/3)(-√2)³)\nArea = (4√2 - (8/3)(2)) - (-4√2 - (8/3)(-2))\nArea = (4√2 - 16/3) - (-4√2 + 16/3)\nArea = 4√2 - 16/3 + 4√2 - 16/3\nArea = 8√2 - 32/3\n\nSo the area enclosed between the two curves y = x² and y = 4 - x² is 8√2 - 32/3 square units."
