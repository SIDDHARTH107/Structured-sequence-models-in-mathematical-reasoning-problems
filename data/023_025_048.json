    "message_1": "A metal alloy has a composition of 75% copper and 25% nickel by weight. The alloy is subjected to a temperature change of 100°C, causing it to expand by 0.05%. Using the Fourier transform and assuming a linear expansion, determine the change in the wavelength of X-ray radiation that experiences the alloy. The original wavelength of the X-ray radiation is 1 Angstrom.",
    "message_2": "To determine the change in the wavelength of X-ray radiation that experiences the alloy, we need to consider the linear expansion of the alloy and its effect on the X-ray radiation.\n\nThe linear expansion of the alloy is given as 0.05%. Since the expansion is linear, we can assume that the change in the wavelength of the X-ray radiation is also linearly related to the expansion of the alloy.\n\nLet Δλ be the change in the wavelength of the X-ray radiation. The original wavelength of the X-ray radiation is given as λ = 1 Angstrom.\n\nThe linear expansion of the alloy can be expressed as a ratio:\n\n(λ + Δλ) / λ = 1 + (0.05 / 100)\n\n(1 + Δλ) / 1 = 1.0005\n\n1 + Δλ = 1.0005\n\nΔλ = 1.0005 - 1\n\nΔλ = 0.0005 Angstrom\n\nSo, the change in the wavelength of the X-ray radiation that experiences the alloy is 0.0005 Angstrom."
