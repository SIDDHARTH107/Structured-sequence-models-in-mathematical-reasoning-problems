    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is constructed by adding a smaller equilateral triangle to each side of the original equilateral triangle, and then repeating this process for each new side created. After each iteration, the number of sides increases and the length of each side decreases.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the original equilateral triangle as s, which is 5 cm in this case. After the first iteration, each side of the original triangle is replaced by 4 sides, each with a length of s/3. So, the perimeter after the first iteration is:\n\nP1 = 3 * 4 * (s/3) = 4s\n\nAfter the second iteration, each side of the first iteration is replaced by 4 sides, each with a length of (s/3)/3 = s/9. There are 4 times as many sides as in the first iteration, so the perimeter after the second iteration is:\n\nP2 = 4 * 4 * (s/9) = 16s/3\n\nAfter the third iteration, each side of the second iteration is replaced by 4 sides, each with a length of (s/9)/3 = s/27. There are 4 times as many sides as in the second iteration, so the perimeter after the third iteration is:\n\nP3 = 4 * 16 * (s/27) = 64s/9\n\nNow, we can plug in the given side length of the original equilateral triangle, s = 5 cm:\n\nP3 = 64 * (5/9) = 320/9 â‰ˆ 35.56 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after the third iteration is approximately 35.56 cm."
