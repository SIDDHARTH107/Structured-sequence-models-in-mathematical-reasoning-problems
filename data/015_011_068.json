    "message_1": "A double pendulum has a mass of 5 kg on the first arm and 3 kg on the second arm. The lengths of the arms are 2 m and 1 m respectively. If the initial angles of the pendulum arms are 30 and 45 degrees with respect to the vertical, what is the maximum angle reached by the second arm after swinging for 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "The motion of a double pendulum is highly complex and cannot be solved analytically. To find the maximum angle reached by the second arm after swinging for 10 seconds, we need to use numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the equations of motion for the double pendulum.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the equations of motion for the double pendulum, which are derived from the Lagrangian mechanics:\n\nLet θ1 and θ2 be the angles of the first and second arms with respect to the vertical, and let m1 and m2 be the masses of the first and second pendulum bobs, and l1 and l2 be the lengths of the first and second arms.\n\nThe equations of motion for the double pendulum are given by:\n\n(1) (m1 + m2) * l1 * θ1'' + m2 * l2 * θ2'' * cos(θ1 - θ2) + m2 * l2 * (θ2')^2 * sin(θ1 - θ2) + (m1 + m2) * g * sin(θ1) = 0\n\n(2) l2 * θ2'' + l1 * θ1'' * cos(θ1 - θ2) - l1 * (θ1')^2 * sin(θ1 - θ2) + g * sin(θ2) = 0\n\nwhere θ1'' and θ2'' are the second derivatives of θ1 and θ2 with respect to time (i.e., the angular accelerations), θ1' and θ2' are the first derivatives of θ1 and θ2 with respect to time (i.e., the angular velocities), and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nGiven the initial conditions (m1 = 5 kg, m2 = 3 kg, l1 = 2 m, l2 = 1 m, θ1(0) = 30°, θ2(0) = 45°), you can use numerical methods to solve these equations of motion and find the maximum angle reached by the second arm after swinging for 10 seconds."
