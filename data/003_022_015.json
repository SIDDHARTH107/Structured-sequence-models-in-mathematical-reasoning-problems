    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v| = √((-2)² + 7²) = √(4 + 49) = √53\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nTo find u · v, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = u₁v₁ + u₂v₂\n\nwhere u₁, u₂, v₁, and v₂ are the components of the vectors u and v.\n\nu · v = (3)(-2) + (4)(7) = -6 + 28 = 22\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|) = 22 / (5√53)\n\nSince we want to find the dot product using trigonometry, we can plug the values back into the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ) = 5 * √53 * (22 / (5√53))\n\nThe √53 and 5 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nu · v = 22\n\nSo, the dot product of the vectors u = (3, 4) and v = (-2, 7) is 22."
