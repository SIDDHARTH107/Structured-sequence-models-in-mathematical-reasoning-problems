Compute a 3-month moving average for the sales data and indicate the sales trend.\n\nMonth | Sales ($1000s)\n---|---\n1 | 40\n2 | 45\n3 | 50\n4 | 47\n5 | 42\n6 | 44\n7 | 50\n8 | 48\n9 | 52\n10 | 55\n11 | 58\n12 | 60",
    "message_2": "To compute a 3-month moving average, we will average the sales data for every 3 consecutive months. We can start from month 3 and go up to month 12. Here are the calculations:\n\n3-month moving average for months 1-3: (40 + 45 + 50) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45\n3-month moving average for months 2-4: (45 + 50 + 47) / 3 = 142 / 3 ≈ 47.33\n3-month moving average for months 3-5: (50 + 47 + 42) / 3 = 139 / 3 ≈ 46.33\n3-month moving average for months 4-6: (47 + 42 + 44) / 3 = 133 / 3 ≈ 44.33\n3-month moving average for months 5-7: (42 + 44 + 50) / 3 = 136 / 3 ≈ 45.33\n3-month moving average for months 6-8: (44 + 50 + 48) / 3 = 142 / 3 ≈ 47.33\n3-month moving average for months 7-9: (50 + 48 + 52) / 3 = 150 / 3 = 50\n3-month moving average for months 8-10: (48 + 52 + 55) / 3 = 155 / 3 ≈ 51.67\n3-month moving average for months 9-11: (52 + 55 + 58) / 3 = 165 / 3 = 55\n3-month moving average for months 10-12: (55 + 58 + 60) / 3 = 173 / 3 ≈ 57.67\n\nNow, let's analyze the sales trend based on the moving averages:\n\nThe moving averages show an overall increasing trend in sales. The sales start at a lower moving average of 45 and gradually increase to a moving average of 57.67 by the end of the 12-month period. There are some fluctuations in the middle, but the general trend is upward."
