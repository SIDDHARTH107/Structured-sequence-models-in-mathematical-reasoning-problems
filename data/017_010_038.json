    "message_2": "To find all possible Cayley tables for groups of order 10, we first need to consider the group axioms:\n\n1. Closure: The group operation must be closed, meaning that the result of the operation on any two elements in the group must also be in the group.\n2. Associativity: The group operation must be associative, meaning that (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for all a, b, and c in the group.\n3. Identity: There must be an identity element e in the group such that a * e = e * a = a for all a in the group.\n4. Inverses: For each element a in the group, there must be an inverse element a^(-1) such that a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible groups of order 10:\n\n1. Cyclic group C10: This group has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} with addition modulo 10 as the group operation. The Cayley table for C10 would look like:\n\n```\n 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1\n 3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2\n 4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3\n 5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4\n 6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5\n 7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6\n 8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7\n 9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8\n```\n\n2. Dihedral group D5: This group represents the symmetries of a regular pentagon and has 10 elements. We can represent the elements as {r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, s0, s1, s2, s3, s4}, where r denotes a rotation and s denotes a reflection. The Cayley table for D5 would look like:\n\n```\n r0  r1  r2  r3  r4  s0  s1  s2  s3  s4\n r1  r2  r3  r4  r0  s1  s2  s3  s4  s0\n r2  r3  r4  r0  r1  s2  s3  s4  s0  s1\n r3  r4  r0  r1  r2  s3  s4  s0  s1  s2\n r4  r0  r1  r2  r3  s4  s0  s1  s2  s3\n s0  s4  s3  s2  s1  r0  r4  r3  r2  r1\n s1  s0  s4  s3  s2  r1  r0  r4  r3  r2\n s2  s1  s0  s4  s3  r2  r1  r0  r4  r3\n s3  s2  s1  s0  s4  r3  r2  r1  r0  r4\n s4  s3  s2  s1  s0  r4  r3  r2  r1  r0\n```\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10: There is only one non-abelian group of order 10, which is the semidirect product of Z5 and Z2. We can represent the elements as {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b, a^4b}, where a has order 5, b has order 2, and ba = a^4b. The Cayley table for this non-abelian group would look like:\n\n```\n  e   a  a^2 a^3 a^4  b  ab a^2b a^3b a^4b\n  a  a^2 a^3 a^4  e  ab a^2b a^3b a^4b  b\n a^2 a^3 a^4  e  a  a^2b a^3b a^4b  b  ab\n a^3 a^4  e  a  a^2 a^3b a^4b  b  ab a^2b\n a^4  e  a  a^2 a^3 a^4b  b  ab a^2b a^3b\n  b  a^4b a^3b a^2b ab  e   a  a^2 a^3 a^4\n ab   b  a^4b a^3b a^2b a  a^2 a^3 a^4  e\n a^2b ab  b  a^4b a^3b a^3 a^4  e   a  a^2\n a^3b a^2b ab  b  a^4b a^4  e   a  a^2 a^3\n a^4b a^3b a^2b ab  b  a^2 a^3 a^4  e   a\n```\n\nSo, we have found the Cayley tables for the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, and the non-abelian group of order 10."
