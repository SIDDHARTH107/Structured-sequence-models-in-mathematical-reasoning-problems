    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, A and B, using two machines, X and Y. Machine X runs for 12 hours per day, while machine Y runs for 10 hours per day. It takes 4 hours to produce one unit of product A on machine X and 3 hours to produce one unit of product A on machine Y. It takes 2 hours to produce one unit of product B on machine X and 1 hour to produce one unit of product B on machine Y. The profit per unit of product A is $80 and for product B is $60. The company wants to maximize the total profit. How many units of product A and product B should be produced using machines X and Y to maximize the profit, given the following constraints? \n\nMachine X: 4A + 2B <= 12, Machine Y: 3A + B <= 10.",
    "message_2": "Let's use linear programming to solve this problem. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP = 80A + 60B\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n4A + 2B <= 12 (Machine X)\n3A + B <= 10 (Machine Y)\nA >= 0\nB >= 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 4A + 2B <= 12\n   Divide by 2:\n   2A + B <= 6\n   B <= -2A + 6\n\n2. 3A + B <= 10\n   B <= -3A + 10\n\nNow, we'll find the intersection points of the constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of 4A + 2B = 12 and 3A + B = 10\n   From the first equation, B = 6 - 2A\n   Substitute into the second equation:\n   3A + (6 - 2A) = 10\n   A = 2\n   B = 6 - 2(2) = 2\n   Point: (2, 2)\n\n2. Intersection of 4A + 2B = 12 and B = 0 (x-axis)\n   4A + 2(0) = 12\n   A = 3\n   B = 0\n   Point: (3, 0)\n\n3. Intersection of 3A + B = 10 and B = 0 (x-axis)\n   3A + 0 = 10\n   A = 10/3 ≈ 3.33\n   B = 0\n   Point: (10/3, 0)\n\n4. Intersection of 3A + B = 10 and A = 0 (y-axis)\n   3(0) + B = 10\n   A = 0\n   B = 10\n   Point: (0, 10)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P = 80A + 60B at each of the intersection points:\n\n1. P(2, 2) = 80(2) + 60(2) = 160 + 120 = 280\n2. P(3, 0) = 80(3) + 60(0) = 240\n3. P(10/3, 0) = 80(10/3) + 60(0) ≈ 266.67\n4. P(0, 10) = 80(0) + 60(10) = 600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (0, 10), where the company should produce 0 units of product A and 10 units of product B. The maximum profit is $600."
