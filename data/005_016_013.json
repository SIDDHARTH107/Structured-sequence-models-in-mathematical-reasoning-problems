    "message_1": "A university wants to determine if there is a correlation between a student's high school GPA and their college success. They gather data on 100 students, including their high school GPA (on a 4.0 scale) and their final college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). Use discriminant analysis to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean high school and college GPAs for these students. Set the level of significance at 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the mean high school and college GPAs for these students using discriminant analysis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of high school GPA and college GPA for the 100 students.\n2. Perform a discriminant analysis using the calculated means and standard deviations.\n3. Calculate the discriminant score for each student.\n4. Compare the discriminant scores to the level of significance (0.05) to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean high school and college GPAs.\n\nHowever, since the actual data of the 100 students' high school and college GPAs are not provided, we cannot perform the calculations and provide a conclusion. Please provide the data for further analysis."
