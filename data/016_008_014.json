    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, the number of segments (N) increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment (s) is reduced to 1/3 of the previous length.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with the number of iterations or the initial length of the line segment. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after five iterations, with an initial line segment length of 1 unit, is still approximately 1.2619."
