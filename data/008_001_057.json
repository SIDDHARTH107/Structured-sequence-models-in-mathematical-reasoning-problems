    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of y's in both equations the same. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 4:\n\n(4)(3x + y) = (4)(9)\n12x + 4y = 36\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n12x + 4y = 36\n2x - 4y = -16\n\nNext, we will add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(12x + 4y) + (2x - 4y) = 36 + (-16)\n12x + 4y + 2x - 4y = 20\n14x = 20\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n14x = 20\nx = 20/14\nx = 10/7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. We will use the first equation:\n\n3x + y = 9\n3(10/7) + y = 9\n30/7 + y = 9\n\nTo solve for y, subtract 30/7 from both sides:\n\ny = 9 - 30/7\ny = (63 - 30)/7\ny = 33/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 10/7 and y = 33/7."
