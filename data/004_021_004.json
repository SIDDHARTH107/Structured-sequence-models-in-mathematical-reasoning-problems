    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x), we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will give us the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nGiven function: f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2)\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 6x\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (4x^3 - 12x^2 + 6x)\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x + 6\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative at x = 2:\nf''(2) = 12(2)^2 - 24(2) + 6\nf''(2) = 12(4) - 48 + 6\nf''(2) = 48 - 48 + 6\nf''(2) = 6\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) at x = 2 is 6."
