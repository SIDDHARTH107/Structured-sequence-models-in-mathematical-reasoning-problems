    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, the Cartesian product of A and B is:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the Cartesian products of {1} and {3, 4} and {2} and {3, 4}:\n\nThe Cartesian product of {1} and {3, 4} is:\n\n{1} x {3, 4} = {(1, 3), (1, 4)}\n\nThe Cartesian product of {2} and {3, 4} is:\n\n{2} x {3, 4} = {(2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nThe union of these two Cartesian products is:\n\n{(1, 3), (1, 4)} ∪ {(2, 3), (2, 4)} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of these two Cartesian products is equal to the Cartesian product of the union of {1} and {2} and the union of {3, 4}:\n\nThe union of {1} and {2} is:\n\n{1} ∪ {2} = {1, 2}\n\nThe union of {3} and {4} is:\n\n{3} ∪ {4} = {3, 4}\n\nThe Cartesian product of the union of {1} and {2} and the union of {3, 4} is:\n\n({1, 2}) x ({3, 4}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, the union of the Cartesian products of {1} and {3, 4} and {2} and {3, 4} is equal to the Cartesian product of the union of {1} and {2} and the union of {3, 4}:\n\n{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nHence, the union of these two Cartesian products is equal to the Cartesian product of the union of {1} and {2} and the union of {3, 4}."
