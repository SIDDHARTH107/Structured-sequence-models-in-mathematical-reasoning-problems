    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = 1/(z^2 - 9) centered at z = -2, we first rewrite the function as follows:\n\nf(z) = 1/((z + 2) - 11)\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula to expand the function:\n\n1/(1 - x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nIn our case, x = (z + 2)/11. So, the Laurent series expansion is:\n\nf(z) = 1 + (z + 2)/11 + (z + 2)^2/11^2 + (z + 2)^3/11^3 + ...\n\nNow, let's find the radius of convergence of the series. The geometric series converges if |x| < 1, so in our case:\n\n|(z + 2)/11| < 1\n\n|z + 2| < 11\n\n-11 < z + 2 < 11\n\n-13 < z < 9\n\nThe radius of convergence is the smaller of the distances from the center of the expansion (-2) to the endpoints of the interval:\n\nR = min(9 - (-2), (-2) - (-13)) = min(11, 11) = 11\n\nSo, the radius of convergence of the Laurent series expansion is 11."
