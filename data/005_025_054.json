She randomly selects 50 students and finds that their average score is 80 with a standard deviation of 10. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean test score of all 200 students in her class?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean test score of all 200 students in the class, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 80, the standard deviation is 10, and the sample size is 50. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the Z-table).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\nStandard Error = 10 / √50\nStandard Error ≈ 1.414\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = Critical Value * Standard Error\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 1.414\nMargin of Error ≈ 2.77\n\nFinally, we can find the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± Margin of Error\nConfidence Interval = 80 ± 2.77\nConfidence Interval ≈ (77.23, 82.77)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean test score of all 200 students in the class is approximately (77.23, 82.77)."
