Suppose that $\\phi_D$ is generically finite onto its image, which is a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{P}^m$ of dimension $d$. Calculate the degree $[\\phi_D(V)]$ and dimension $\\dim[\\phi_D(V)]$ of $\\phi_D(V)$.",
    "message_2": "Since $\\phi_D$ is generically finite onto its image, there exists an open subset $U \\subseteq V$ such that $\\phi_D|_U: U \\rightarrow \\phi_D(U)$ is a finite morphism. Let $e$ be the degree of this finite morphism, i.e., for a generic point $x \\in U$, the fiber $\\phi_D^{-1}(\\phi_D(x))$ consists of $e$ points.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of $\\phi_D(V)$. Recall that the degree of a projective variety is the number of intersection points with a generic linear subspace of complementary dimension. Since $\\phi_D(V)$ is a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{P}^m$ of dimension $d$, we need to intersect it with a generic linear subspace of dimension $m-d-1$. \n\nConsider the pullback of such a generic linear subspace under $\\phi_D$. This pullback is a divisor $D'$ on $V$ such that $D' \\sim eD$, where $\\sim$ denotes linear equivalence. This is because the intersection of $V$ with the pullback of the generic linear subspace corresponds to the intersection of $\\phi_D(V)$ with the generic linear subspace, and this intersection has $e$ times the number of points as the intersection of $V$ with $D$.\n\nNow, we can compute the degree of $\\phi_D(V)$ using the intersection number of $D'$ with $V$. Since $D' \\sim eD$, we have $D'^{\\dim V - 1} = (eD)^{\\dim V - 1} = e^{\\dim V - 1} D^{\\dim V - 1}$. By assumption, $D^{\\dim V - 1} > 0$, so the degree of $\\phi_D(V)$ is $e^{\\dim V - 1}$.\n\nFinally, the dimension of $\\phi_D(V)$ is simply the dimension of the image, which is given as $d$. In summary, we have:\n\nDegree of $\\phi_D(V) = e^{\\dim V - 1}$,\nDimension of $\\phi_D(V) = d$."
