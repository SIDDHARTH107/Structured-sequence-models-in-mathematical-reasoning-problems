    "message_2": "The connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that need to be removed to disconnect the graph or make it trivial. To find the connectivity of a graph G with 7 vertices and 10 edges, we can use Menger's theorem, which states that the connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimum number of vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices.\n\nHowever, Menger's theorem is not easy to apply directly without knowing the structure of the graph. Instead, we can use the fact that the connectivity of a graph is less than or equal to its minimum degree. The minimum degree of a graph is the smallest degree of any vertex in the graph.\n\nIn a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 10) / 7 â‰ˆ 2.857. Since the average degree is not an integer, there must be some vertices with a degree higher than the average and some with a degree lower than the average. Therefore, the minimum degree of a vertex in the graph is at most 2.\n\nThus, the connectivity of the graph G with 7 vertices and 10 edges is at most 2. Without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact connectivity, but we can conclude that it is at most 2."
