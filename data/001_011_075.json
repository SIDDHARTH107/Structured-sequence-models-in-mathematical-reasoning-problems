    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first find a common denominator for the three fractions, which is the product of the three denominators: (x-1)(x+2)(x+3). Then, we will rewrite each fraction with the common denominator and combine them into a single fraction. Finally, we will solve the resulting equation for x.\n\nStep 1: Find the common denominator\nThe common denominator is (x-1)(x+2)(x+3).\n\nStep 2: Rewrite each fraction with the common denominator\n$\\frac{2(x+2)(x+3)}{(x-1)(x+2)(x+3)} + \\frac{3(x-1)(x+3)}{(x-1)(x+2)(x+3)} = \\frac{4(x-1)(x+2)}{(x-1)(x+2)(x+3)}$\n\nStep 3: Combine the fractions\n$\\frac{2(x+2)(x+3) + 3(x-1)(x+3) - 4(x-1)(x+2)}{(x-1)(x+2)(x+3)} = 0$\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation\nSince the denominator cannot be equal to zero, we only need to solve the numerator for x:\n$2(x+2)(x+3) + 3(x-1)(x+3) - 4(x-1)(x+2) = 0$\n\nExpanding the terms:\n$2(x^2 + 5x + 6) + 3(x^2 + 2x - 3) - 4(x^2 + x - 2) = 0$\n\nCombining like terms:\n$2x^2 + 10x + 12 + 3x^2 + 6x - 9 - 4x^2 - 4x + 8 = 0$\n\nSimplifying:\n$x^2 + 12x + 11 = 0$\n\nFactoring:\n$(x + 1)(x + 11) = 0$\n\nSolving for x:\n$x = -1$ or $x = -11$\n\nSo, the solutions for x are -1 and -11."
