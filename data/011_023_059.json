    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure and its maximum degree (the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex).\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the graph would require 9 colors, as each vertex would be adjacent to all other vertices.\n\nHowever, without more information about the structure of the graph and the connections between the vertices, it is impossible to determine the exact minimum number of colors needed."
