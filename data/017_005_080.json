    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G is either 1 or 25. \n\nCase 1: There is only one 5-Sylow subgroup in G.\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Then P has order 5^3 = 125, and by Sylow's theorem, P is a normal subgroup of G. Since G has order 125 and P has order 125, we have P = G. Thus, G is a p-group of order 5^3. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z_125, Z_25 × Z_5, or Z_5 × Z_5 × Z_5. However, Z_5 × Z_5 × Z_5 has no element of order 25, so it cannot be isomorphic to G. Therefore, G is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_125) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25 (isomorphic to Z_25 × Z_5).\n\nCase 2: There are 25 5-Sylow subgroups in G.\nLet P be one of the 5-Sylow subgroups of G. Then P has order 5^3 = 125. Since there are 25 5-Sylow subgroups in G, by Sylow's theorem, the normalizer N(P) of P in G has index 25 in G. Thus, |N(P)| = 5. Let Q be a subgroup of N(P) with order 5. Then Q is a normal subgroup of N(P) since it has prime order. \n\nNow, consider the product PQ. Since |P| = 125 and |Q| = 5, and P ∩ Q = {e} (the identity element), we have |PQ| = |P||Q| = 625. However, this is not possible since |G| = 125. Therefore, there is no such group G with 25 5-Sylow subgroups.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 125 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
