    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $$\\sqrt{147}$$, we need to find the prime factors of 147 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n147 can be factored as 3 × 49. Since 49 is a perfect square (7 × 7), we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\n$$\\sqrt{147} = \\sqrt{3 × 49} = \\sqrt{3 × 7 × 7}$$\n\nNow, we can take the square root of the perfect square (49) and move it outside the radical:\n\n$$\\sqrt{3 × 7 × 7} = 7\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n$$\\sqrt{147} = 7\\sqrt{3}$$"
