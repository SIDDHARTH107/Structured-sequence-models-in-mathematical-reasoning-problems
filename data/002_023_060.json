    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (7^2)\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 49\nSurface Area ≈ 4 * 3.14159 * 49\nSurface Area ≈ 12.56636 * 49\nSurface Area ≈ 615.75216\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 7 cm is approximately 615.75 square centimeters."
