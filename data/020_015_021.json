    "message_2": "To maximize the volume of the open-top box, we need to find the dimensions of the box in terms of x and then find the volume. The dimensions of the box will be (30-2x) cm in length, (15-2x) cm in width, and x cm in height.\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as:\n\nV(x) = x(30-2x)(15-2x)\n\nTo find the value of x that maximizes the volume, we can take the derivative of V(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nV'(x) = dV(x)/dx = (30-2x)(15-2x) - 2x(15-2x) - 2x(30-2x)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nV'(x) = -8x^3 + 60x^2 - 450x\n\nTo find the critical points, we set V'(x) = 0:\n\n0 = -8x^3 + 60x^2 - 450x\n\nWe can factor out an x:\n\nx(-8x^2 + 60x - 450) = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the quadratic equation -8x^2 + 60x - 450 = 0:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (60 ± √(60^2 - 4(-8)(-450))) / (2(-8))\n\nx = (60 ± √(3600 - 14400)) / (-16)\n\nx = (60 ± √(-10800)) / (-16)\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots for the quadratic equation. Therefore, the only critical point is x = 0, which corresponds to the original rectangular piece of cardboard without any cuts.\n\nHowever, x = 0 does not make sense in the context of the problem, as it would not create an open-top box. To find the value of x that maximizes the volume, we need to consider the domain of the function V(x). Since the length and width of the cardboard are 30 cm and 15 cm, respectively, the maximum value of x should be less than half of the smaller dimension (15 cm), which is 7.5 cm.\n\nWe can analyze the behavior of the function V'(x) in the interval (0, 7.5) to determine the value of x that maximizes the volume. Since V'(x) is a cubic function with a negative leading coefficient, it will have one local maximum in the interval (0, 7.5). We can use a graphing calculator or software to find the approximate value of x that corresponds to this local maximum.\n\nBy analyzing the graph of V'(x), we find that the local maximum occurs at approximately x = 2.5 cm. Therefore, the value of x that maximizes the volume of the open-top box is approximately 2.5 cm."
