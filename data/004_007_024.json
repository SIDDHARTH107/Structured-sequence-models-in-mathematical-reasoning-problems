    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(u) = sin(u) and the inner function is g(x) = x^2 - 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(u) and g(x) with respect to their respective variables:\n\nf'(u) = d(sin(u))/du = cos(u)\ng'(x) = d(x^2 - 5)/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of h(x) = f(g(x)):\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the derivatives we found earlier:\n\nh'(x) = cos(g(x)) * 2x\n\nNow we need to find the value of h'(x) when x = 3:\n\nh'(3) = cos(g(3)) * 2(3)\n\nFirst, find g(3):\n\ng(3) = (3)^2 - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4\n\nNow substitute this value into the expression for h'(3):\n\nh'(3) = cos(4) * 2(3) = cos(4) * 6\n\nSo, the derivative of the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)) when x = 3 is:\n\nh'(3) = 6cos(4)"
