    "message_2": "To graph the function y = 2sin(x), we first need to identify the amplitude, period, and phase shift.\n\nAmplitude: The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 2, so the amplitude is 2.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is the interval over which the function repeats itself. For the standard sine function, y = sin(x), the period is 2π. Since there is no coefficient affecting the x-value in our function, the period remains 2π.\n\nPhase Shift: The phase shift is the horizontal shift of the graph. Since there is no constant added or subtracted from the x-value inside the sine function, the phase shift is 0.\n\nNow, let's plot at least two periods of the graph.\n\n1. Start by plotting the key points of one period of the standard sine function, y = sin(x), on the interval [0, 2π]. The key points are (0, 0), (π/2, 1), (π, 0), (3π/2, -1), and (2π, 0).\n\n2. Multiply the y-values of the key points by the amplitude (2) to get the key points for y = 2sin(x): (0, 0), (π/2, 2), (π, 0), (3π/2, -2), and (2π, 0).\n\n3. Plot these key points on the coordinate plane and sketch the curve of the graph for one period.\n\n4. To plot a second period, add the period (2π) to the x-values of the key points: (2π, 0), (5π/2, 2), (3π, 0), (7π/2, -2), and (4π, 0).\n\n5. Plot these key points on the coordinate plane and sketch the curve of the graph for the second period.\n\nNow you have graphed two periods of the function y = 2sin(x) on the coordinate plane."
