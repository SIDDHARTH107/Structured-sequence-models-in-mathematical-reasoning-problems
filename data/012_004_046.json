Find the minimum spanning tree of the city to determine the shortest possible network of roads that connect all the neighborhoods.\n\n|    | N1 | N2 | N3 | N4 | N5 | N6 |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| N1 | 0  | 8  | 3  | 5  | 12 | 10 |\n| N2 | 8  | 0  | 7  | 6  | 5  | 11 |\n| N3 | 3  | 7  | 0  | 5  | 5  | 13 |\n| N4 | 5  | 6  | 5  | 0  | 3  | 8  |\n| N5 | 12 | 5  | 5  | 3  | 0  | 4  |\n| N6 | 10 | 11 | 13 | 8  | 4  | 0  |",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we list all the edges in the graph and sort them by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. N1-N3: 3\n2. N4-N5: 3\n3. N5-N6: 4\n4. N1-N4: 5\n5. N3-N4: 5\n6. N3-N5: 5\n7. N2-N5: 5\n8. N2-N4: 6\n9. N1-N2: 8\n10. N4-N6: 8\n11. N1-N6: 10\n12. N2-N6: 11\n13. N3-N6: 13\n\nNow, we start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree while making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add N1-N3 (weight 3)\n2. Add N4-N5 (weight 3)\n3. Add N5-N6 (weight 4)\n4. Add N1-N4 (weight 5) - Note: N3-N4 and N3-N5 are skipped because they would create cycles.\n5. Add N2-N5 (weight 5)\n\nNow, all the neighborhoods are connected, and we have our minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. N1-N3: 3\n2. N4-N5: 3\n3. N5-N6: 4\n4. N1-N4: 5\n5. N2-N5: 5\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 20."
