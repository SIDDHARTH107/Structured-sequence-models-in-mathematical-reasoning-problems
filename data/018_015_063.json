If it were commutative, then AxB ∩ BxA would be equal to BxA ∩ AxB. However, as we can see from the sets above, the intersection of AxB and BxA is not equal to the intersection of BxA and AxB:\n\n(AxB) ∩ (BxA) = {(2,2), (3,3)} ≠ {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)} = (BxA) ∩ (AxB)\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
