    "message_1": "A store owner has a knapsack with a maximum capacity of 15 kg. He wants to fill it with items of different weights and values. He has 4 items to choose from:\n\n- Item A with a weight of 4 kg and a value of $12\n- Item B with a weight of 5 kg and a value of $10\n- Item C with a weight of 7 kg and a value of $14\n- Item D with a weight of 3 kg and a value of $7\n\nWhat is the maximum value the store owner can obtain by filling the knapsack with items?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value the store owner can obtain, we need to determine the best combination of items that fit within the 15 kg weight limit. We can do this by calculating the value-to-weight ratio for each item and then selecting the items with the highest ratios that fit within the weight limit.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\n- Item A: 12/4 = 3\n- Item B: 10/5 = 2\n- Item C: 14/7 = 2\n- Item D: 7/3 â‰ˆ 2.33\n\nBased on the value-to-weight ratios, we should prioritize selecting Item A, then Item D, then either Item B or Item C.\n\n1. Select Item A (4 kg, $12 value): Remaining capacity = 15 kg - 4 kg = 11 kg\n2. Select Item D (3 kg, $7 value): Remaining capacity = 11 kg - 3 kg = 8 kg\n\nNow we have 8 kg of remaining capacity, and we can choose either Item B or Item C. Since both have the same value-to-weight ratio, we can choose the one with the higher value, which is Item C.\n\n3. Select Item C (7 kg, $14 value): Remaining capacity = 8 kg - 7 kg = 1 kg\n\nThe maximum value the store owner can obtain is $12 (Item A) + $7 (Item D) + $14 (Item C) = $33."
