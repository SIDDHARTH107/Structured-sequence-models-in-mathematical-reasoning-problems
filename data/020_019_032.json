    "message_1": "A rocket is launched from Earth with an initial velocity of 500 m/s. Its altitude can be modeled by the function h(t) = -0.3t^2 + 500t, where t is the time in seconds after launch. The rocket has a maximum fuel capacity of 10,000 liters and its engine burns fuel at a constant rate of 20 liters per second. What is the maximum altitude the rocket can reach before running out of fuel?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine how long the rocket can burn fuel before running out. We can do this by dividing the total fuel capacity by the fuel consumption rate:\n\nFuel capacity / Fuel consumption rate = Time\n10,000 liters / 20 liters per second = 500 seconds\n\nNow that we know the rocket will run out of fuel after 500 seconds, we can plug this value into the altitude function h(t) to find the maximum altitude:\n\nh(t) = -0.3t^2 + 500t\nh(500) = -0.3(500)^2 + 500(500)\n\nh(500) = -0.3(250,000) + 250,000\nh(500) = -75,000 + 250,000\nh(500) = 175,000 meters\n\nSo the maximum altitude the rocket can reach before running out of fuel is 175,000 meters."
