    "message_1": "Suppose a company has 50 employees and there is a probability of 0.05 that any given employee is involved in a financial fraud. What is the probability that at least 3 employees in the company are involved in financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 3 employees are involved in financial fraud, we can use the complement rule. The complement of \"at least 3 employees involved in financial fraud\" is \"0, 1, or 2 employees involved in financial fraud\". So, we will find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 employees involved in financial fraud and subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least 3 employees involved in financial fraud.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of employees (50)\n- k is the number of employees involved in financial fraud (0, 1, or 2)\n- p is the probability of an employee being involved in financial fraud (0.05)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 employees involved in financial fraud (k=0):\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(50-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^50\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.129\n\nNext, let's find the probability of 1 employee involved in financial fraud (k=1):\n\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(50-1)\nP(X = 1) = 50 * 0.05 * (0.95)^49\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.337\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of 2 employees involved in financial fraud (k=2):\n\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (1-0.05)^(50-2)\nP(X = 2) = 1225 * 0.0025 * (0.95)^48\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.291\n\nNow, let's find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 employees involved in financial fraud:\n\nP(X = 0, 1, or 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\nP(X = 0, 1, or 2) ≈ 0.129 + 0.337 + 0.291\nP(X = 0, 1, or 2) ≈ 0.757\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of at least 3 employees involved in financial fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X = 0, 1, or 2)\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - 0.757\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 0.243\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 employees in the company are involved in financial fraud is approximately 0.243 or 24.3%."
