Polya's enumeration theorem can be used to solve this problem.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem, we need to find the cycle index polynomial of the dihedral group D_11, which represents the symmetry group of a bracelet with 11 beads. The cycle index polynomial is given by:\n\nZ(D_11) = (1/22) * (x1^11 + 11x1^5x2^3 + 10x11)\n\nNow, we substitute the variables x1, x2, and x11 with the number of ways to color each cycle with the given beads. In this case, we have 6 red, 3 blue, and 2 green beads. So, we have:\n\nx1 = (6 red + 3 blue + 2 green) = 11\nx2 = (6 red + 3 blue + 2 green)^2 = 121\nx11 = (6 red + 3 blue + 2 green)^11 = 285311670611\n\nSubstituting these values into the cycle index polynomial, we get:\n\nZ(D_11) = (1/22) * (11^11 + 11*11^5*121^3 + 10*285311670611)\nZ(D_11) = (1/22) * (285311670611 + 11*161051*1771561 + 10*285311670611)\nZ(D_11) = (1/22) * (285311670611 + 3176523*1771561 + 2853116706110)\nZ(D_11) = (1/22) * (285311670611 + 5629506421 + 2853116706110)\nZ(D_11) = (1/22) * (3416159777042)\n\nTherefore, there are 3416159777042 / 22 = 155279989865 distinct bracelets that can be created using six red, three blue, and two green beads."
