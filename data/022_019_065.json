Determine the specific value of f(1/2).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first rewrite the integral equation using polar coordinates. Let z = e^(iθ) for some θ in [0, 2π]. Then, the integral equation becomes:\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = e^(iθ) + (2/π) ∫︀(0)^(2π) ln|e^(iθ) − e^(it)|f(e^(it))dt\n\nNow, we want to find the specific value of f(1/2). To do this, we will substitute z = 1/2 into the integral equation. Since |1/2| ≠ 1, we need to find a value of θ such that e^(iθ) = 1/2. We can do this by setting θ = π:\n\nf(e^(iπ)) = e^(iπ) + (2/π) ∫︀(0)^(2π) ln|e^(iπ) − e^(it)|f(e^(it))dt\n\nNow, we have:\n\nf(-1) = -1 + (2/π) ∫︀(0)^(2π) ln|-1 − e^(it)|f(e^(it))dt\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we will use the property of logarithms that ln|a - b| = ln|b - a|. This allows us to rewrite the integral as:\n\nf(-1) = -1 + (2/π) ∫︀(0)^(2π) ln|e^(it) + 1|f(e^(it))dt\n\nNow, we will use the substitution u = e^(it) + 1. Then, du = ie^(it)dt, and the integral becomes:\n\nf(-1) = -1 + (2/π) ∫︀(0)^(2π) ln|u|f(u - 1)(du/iu)\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy integral formula to evaluate the integral. The Cauchy integral formula states that for a holomorphic function g(z) on a simply connected domain D containing the unit circle, we have:\n\ng(z) = (1/2πi) ∫︀(∂D) g(w)/(w - z)dw\n\nApplying the Cauchy integral formula to our integral equation, we get:\n\nf(-1) = -1 + (2/π) (1/2πi) ∫︀(∂D) ln|u|f(u - 1)/(u - (-1))du\n\nSince f(z) is continuous on the unit circle, it is holomorphic on the unit disk, which is a simply connected domain. Therefore, the integral evaluates to 0, and we have:\n\nf(-1) = -1\n\nThus, the specific value of f(1/2) is f(-1) = -1."
