Prove that their homotopy groups are also the same in dimensions k+1. Specifically, prove that:\n\nπk+1(X) ≅ πk+1(Y)\n\nwhere πk+1(X) and πk+1(Y) are the k+1-th homotopy groups of X and Y, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To prove that πk+1(X) ≅ πk+1(Y), we will use the Whitehead theorem. The Whitehead theorem states that if two connected CW complexes X and Y have the same homotopy groups up to dimension k, and if the induced maps on homotopy groups are isomorphisms up to dimension k, then X and Y are homotopy equivalent.\n\nFirst, let's assume that X and Y are CW complexes. Since X and Y are path-connected, they are also connected. We are given that both X and Y have the same homotopy groups up to dimension k, i.e., πi(X) ≅ πi(Y) for all i ≤ k.\n\nNow, let's consider a map f: X → Y such that the induced maps on homotopy groups are isomorphisms up to dimension k, i.e., f*: πi(X) → πi(Y) are isomorphisms for all i ≤ k.\n\nBy the Whitehead theorem, since X and Y are connected CW complexes with the same homotopy groups up to dimension k and the induced maps on homotopy groups are isomorphisms up to dimension k, X and Y are homotopy equivalent. This means that there exists a map g: Y → X such that fg ≃ id_Y and gf ≃ id_X.\n\nNow, let's consider the induced maps on the (k+1)-th homotopy groups:\n\nf*: πk+1(X) → πk+1(Y)\ng*: πk+1(Y) → πk+1(X)\n\nSince fg ≃ id_Y and gf ≃ id_X, it follows that (fg)* = f*g* ≃ id_Y* and (gf)* = g*f* ≃ id_X*. Therefore, f* and g* are inverses of each other, which implies that f* is an isomorphism.\n\nThus, we have shown that πk+1(X) ≅ πk+1(Y) for connected CW complexes X and Y with the same homotopy groups up to dimension k.\n\nIf X and Y are not CW complexes, we can still apply the above argument by considering their CW approximations. The homotopy groups of a space and its CW approximation are isomorphic, so the result still holds for general topological spaces."
