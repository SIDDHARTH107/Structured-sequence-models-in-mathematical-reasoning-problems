    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval [1, 5], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 5\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to zero:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, we have one critical point at x = 2. Since the function is a quadratic function and its leading coefficient is positive (3 > 0), we know that the graph of the function is a parabola opening upwards. Therefore, the critical point corresponds to a minimum value of the function.\n\nNow, let's evaluate f(x) at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval [1, 5]:\n\nf(1) = 3(1)^2 - 12(1) + 5 = 3 - 12 + 5 = -4\nf(2) = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 5 = 12 - 24 + 5 = -7\nf(5) = 3(5)^2 - 12(5) + 5 = 75 - 60 + 5 = 20\n\nComparing these values, we find that the minimum value of f(x) in the interval [1, 5] is -7, which occurs at x = 2, and the maximum value is 20, which occurs at x = 5."
