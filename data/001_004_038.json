    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x² + 7x + 10, we need to find two binomials (ax + b)(cx + d) such that their product equals the given polynomial.\n\nWe look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (10) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (7). In this case, those two numbers are 5 and 2.\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n(x + 5)(x + 2)"
