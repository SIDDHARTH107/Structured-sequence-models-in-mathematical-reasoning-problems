    "message_1": "Suppose a car manufacturing company claims that the average gas mileage of their new sedan is at least 30 miles per gallon. A sample of 40 cars is taken, and the average gas mileage is found to be 28 miles per gallon with a standard deviation of 4 miles per gallon. Using a 5% level of significance, can you reject the manufacturer’s claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average gas mileage is at least 30 miles per gallon, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average gas mileage is less than 30 miles per gallon.\n\nH0: μ ≥ 30\nH1: μ < 30\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 40\nSample mean (x̄) = 28 miles per gallon\nSample standard deviation (s) = 4 miles per gallon\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is large enough (n > 30), we can use the t-distribution to perform the t-test.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the t-score.\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (28 - 30) / (4 / √40)\nt = -2 / (4 / 6.325)\nt = -2 / 0.6325\nt ≈ -3.16\n\nStep 2: Determine the critical t-value.\nSince we are performing a one-tailed test with a 5% level of significance and 39 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39), we can find the critical t-value from the t-distribution table or using a calculator.\n\nt_critical ≈ -1.685\n\nStep 3: Compare the t-score with the critical t-value.\nOur calculated t-score (-3.16) is less than the critical t-value (-1.685).\n\nSince the t-score is in the critical region, we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, at a 5% level of significance, we have enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim that the average gas mileage of their new sedan is at least 30 miles per gallon."
