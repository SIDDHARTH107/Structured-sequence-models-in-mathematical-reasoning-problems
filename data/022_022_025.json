    "message_2": "To compute the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = e^(-|x|)cos(x), we need to evaluate the following integral:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-|x|)cos(x)]e^(-ikx) dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince the function is even, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(k) = 2 ∫[e^(-|x|)cos(x)]cos(kx) dx from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts, one for x ≥ 0 and one for x < 0. Since e^(-|x|) = e^(-x) for x ≥ 0 and e^(-|x|) = e^(x) for x < 0, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(k) = 2[∫[e^(-x)cos(x)]cos(kx) dx from 0 to ∞ + ∫[e^(x)cos(x)]cos(kx) dx from -∞ to 0]\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve each integral. Let's start with the first integral:\n\nu = e^(-x)cos(x), dv = cos(kx) dx\ndu = (-e^(-x)cos(x) - e^(-x)sin(x)) dx, v = (1/k)sin(kx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\n∫[e^(-x)cos(x)]cos(kx) dx = (1/k)e^(-x)cos(x)sin(kx) - (1/k)∫(-e^(-x)cos(x)sin(kx) - e^(-x)sin(x)cos(kx)) dx\n\nLet's call this integral I1.\n\nNow, let's solve the second integral:\n\nu = e^(x)cos(x), dv = cos(kx) dx\ndu = (e^(x)cos(x) - e^(x)sin(x)) dx, v = (1/k)sin(kx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\n∫[e^(x)cos(x)]cos(kx) dx = (1/k)e^(x)cos(x)sin(kx) - (1/k)∫(e^(x)cos(x)sin(kx) - e^(x)sin(x)cos(kx)) dx\n\nLet's call this integral I2.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nF(k) = 2[I1 + I2]\n\nTo find the final solution, we need to evaluate the limits of integration for I1 and I2 and sum them up. However, this is a complex integral, and the final solution may not be easily expressible in a closed form. In practice, one would use numerical methods to approximate the Fourier transform for specific values of k."
