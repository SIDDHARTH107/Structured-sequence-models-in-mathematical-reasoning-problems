    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Sierpinski pyramid, is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of tetrahedra at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of tetrahedra at level n = 4^n\n\nTo find the total number of tetrahedra required to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron with 5 levels, we need to sum the number of tetrahedra at each level from 0 to 4:\n\nTotal number of tetrahedra = 4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 + 4^4\n= 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256\n= 341\n\nSo, a Sierpinski tetrahedron with 5 levels requires a total of 341 tetrahedra."
