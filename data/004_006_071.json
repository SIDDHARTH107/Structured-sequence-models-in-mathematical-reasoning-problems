    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5$, we first need to find its derivative, $f'(x)$.\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $x$ for which $f'(x) = 0$. These values are the critical points of the function.\n\n$3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first factor out the greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\n$3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0$\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\n$(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two solutions for $x$:\n\n$x = 1$ and $x = 3$\n\nSo, the critical points of the function $f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5$ are $x = 1$ and $x = 3$."
