    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon with a side length of 5 meters, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * s^2) / 2\n\nwhere s is the side length of the hexagon.\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * 5^2) / 2\nArea = (3 * √3 * 25) / 2\nArea = (75 * √3) / 2\nArea ≈ 64.95 square meters\n\nThe area of the regular hexagon is approximately 64.95 square meters."
