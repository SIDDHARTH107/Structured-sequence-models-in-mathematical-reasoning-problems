    "message_2": "To find the values of log(-1 + 2i) and log(-3 + 4i) using the method of analytic continuation, we first need to express the complex numbers in polar form.\n\nRecall that a complex number z = x + yi can be written in polar form as z = r(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)), where r = |z| is the magnitude of z and θ is the argument of z.\n\n1. For z = -1 + 2i:\n\nThe magnitude is |z| = r = √((-1)^2 + (2)^2) = √5.\n\nThe argument is θ = arctan(Im(z) / Re(z)) = arctan(2 / -1) = arctan(-2). Since the complex number is in the second quadrant, we add π to the arctan value: θ = arctan(-2) + π.\n\nNow, we can write z in polar form: z = √5(cos(arctan(-2) + π) + i sin(arctan(-2) + π)).\n\n2. For z = -3 + 4i:\n\nThe magnitude is |z| = r = √((-3)^2 + (4)^2) = 5.\n\nThe argument is θ = arctan(Im(z) / Re(z)) = arctan(4 / -3) = arctan(-4/3). Since the complex number is in the second quadrant, we add π to the arctan value: θ = arctan(-4/3) + π.\n\nNow, we can write z in polar form: z = 5(cos(arctan(-4/3) + π) + i sin(arctan(-4/3) + π)).\n\nNow, we can find the values of the logarithms using the polar forms of the complex numbers.\n\n1. log(-1 + 2i):\n\nUsing the polar form, we have log(√5(cos(arctan(-2) + π) + i sin(arctan(-2) + π))).\n\nApplying the logarithm properties, we get log(√5) + log(cos(arctan(-2) + π) + i sin(arctan(-2) + π)).\n\nThe logarithm of a complex number in polar form is given by log(r) + iθ, so we have:\n\nlog(√5) + i(arctan(-2) + π).\n\n2. log(-3 + 4i):\n\nUsing the polar form, we have log(5(cos(arctan(-4/3) + π) + i sin(arctan(-4/3) + π))).\n\nApplying the logarithm properties, we get log(5) + log(cos(arctan(-4/3) + π) + i sin(arctan(-4/3) + π)).\n\nThe logarithm of a complex number in polar form is given by log(r) + iθ, so we have:\n\nlog(5) + i(arctan(-4/3) + π).\n\nSo, the values of log(-1 + 2i) and log(-3 + 4i) are:\n\nlog(-1 + 2i) = log(√5) + i(arctan(-2) + π)\nlog(-3 + 4i) = log(5) + i(arctan(-4/3) + π)"
