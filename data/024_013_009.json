    "message_2": "To determine the volume form of the given metric, we first need to find the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is a matrix representation of the metric, with elements given by the coefficients of the differential forms in the metric:\n\n$g_{ij} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2xy & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & y^2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of this matrix:\n\n$\\det(g_{ij}) = 1(2xy(y^2) - 0) - 0 + 0 = 2xy^3$\n\nThe volume form is given by the square root of the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by the standard volume form in 3D, which is $dV = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$:\n\n$\\sqrt{|\\det(g_{ij})|} \\ dV = \\sqrt{2xy^3} \\ dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$\n\nNow, we evaluate the volume form at the point $(1,1,1)$:\n\n$\\sqrt{2(1)(1)^3} \\ dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = \\sqrt{2} \\ dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$\n\nSo, the volume form of the given metric at the point $(1,1,1)$ is $\\sqrt{2} \\ dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$."
