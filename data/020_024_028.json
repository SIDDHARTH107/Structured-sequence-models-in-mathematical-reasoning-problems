What should be the optimal price for the product in order to maximize the profit of the company? Assume that the demand function for the product is Q = 100 - 0.5P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize profit, we first need to find the revenue function and then the profit function. \n\nRevenue (R) is the product of price (P) and quantity (Q). We have the demand function Q = 100 - 0.5P. So, we can write the revenue function as:\n\nR(P) = P * Q(P) = P * (100 - 0.5P)\n\nNow, let's find the profit function. Profit (π) is the difference between revenue and cost. The cost function is given as the marginal cost (MC) times the quantity (Q). The marginal cost is constant at $15.\n\nπ(P) = R(P) - MC * Q(P) = P * (100 - 0.5P) - 15 * (100 - 0.5P)\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative with respect to P and setting it equal to 0.\n\ndπ(P)/dP = (100 - 0.5P) - P - 7.5 = 0\n\nSolving for P:\n\n92.5 - 1.5P = 0\n1.5P = 92.5\nP = 61.67\n\nSo, the optimal price to maximize profit is approximately $61.67."
