    "message_2": "To find the number of non-defective parts produced per day, we first need to calculate the number of defective parts.\n\nNumber of defective parts = 10% of 1000\nNumber of defective parts = (10/100) * 1000\nNumber of defective parts = 100\n\nNow, we can find the number of non-defective parts.\n\nNumber of non-defective parts = Total parts produced - Number of defective parts\nNumber of non-defective parts = 1000 - 100\nNumber of non-defective parts = 900\n\nSo, the machine produces 900 non-defective parts per day."
