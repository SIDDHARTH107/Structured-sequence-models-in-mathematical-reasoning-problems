    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider the number of handshakes each person has. Since there are 6 people in the room, each person can have a maximum of 5 handshakes (with the other 5 people). \n\nNow, let's divide the people into two groups: those who shook hands with a particular person (let's call this person A) and those who did not. Since there are 5 other people besides person A, we can have at most 2 people in each group to avoid having 3 people who all shook hands with each other or 3 people where none of them shook hands with each other.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario: there are 2 people in each group. In this case, person A shook hands with 2 people, and there are 3 people left who did not shake hands with person A. Now, let's focus on one of the people who did not shake hands with person A (let's call this person B). \n\nIf person B shakes hands with any of the other 2 people who did not shake hands with person A, then we have 3 people who all shook hands with each other (person A's group). If person B does not shake hands with either of the other 2 people who did not shake hands with person A, then we have 3 people where none of them shook hands with each other (person B and the other 2 people who did not shake hands with person A).\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, we need a minimum of 3 handshakes to ensure that there are either 3 people who all shook hands with each other or 3 people where none of them shook hands with each other."
