Let the temperature $u$ be initially given by:\n\n$u(x,y,0) = \\sin(\\pi x) \\sin(\\pi y)$\n\nsubject to the following boundary conditions:\n\n$u(0,y,t) = u(1,y,t) = u(x,0,t) = u(x,1,t) = 0$ for all $t \\geq 0$\n\nUsing the method of separation of variables, find the solution $u(x,y,t)$ to this problem for all $t \\geq 0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using separation of variables, we assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of individual variables: $u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)Y(y)\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\alpha\\left(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y)\\right)T(t)$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $XYT$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{T'}{T} = \\frac{X''}{X} + \\frac{Y''}{Y}$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{T'}{T} = -\\lambda$\n\n$\\frac{X''}{X} + \\frac{Y''}{Y} = -\\lambda$\n\nNow we have three ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. $\\frac{T'}{T} = -\\alpha\\lambda$\n2. $X'' = -\\lambda X$\n3. $Y'' = -\\lambda Y$\n\nSolving the first equation for $T(t)$, we get:\n\n$T(t) = Ce^{-\\alpha\\lambda t}$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nFor the second and third equations, we have the following boundary conditions:\n\n$X(0) = X(1) = 0$\n\n$Y(0) = Y(1) = 0$\n\nThe solutions to these equations are:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$\n\n$Y(y) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y)$\n\nTo satisfy the boundary conditions, we must have $\\sqrt{\\lambda} = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, the solution for $u(x, y, t)$ is given by:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{nm} \\sin(n\\pi x) \\sin(m\\pi y) e^{-(n^2 + m^2)\\pi^2\\alpha t}$\n\nTo find the coefficients $C_{nm}$, we use the initial condition $u(x, y, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x) \\sin(\\pi y)$:\n\n$\\sin(\\pi x) \\sin(\\pi y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{nm} \\sin(n\\pi x) \\sin(m\\pi y)$\n\nComparing the terms, we see that $C_{11} = 1$ and all other coefficients are zero. Therefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = \\sin(\\pi x) \\sin(\\pi y) e^{-\\pi^2\\alpha t}$"
