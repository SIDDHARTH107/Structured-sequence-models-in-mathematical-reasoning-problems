    "message_2": "To find the distance the car covers before coming to a complete stop, we can use the following equation:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity (0 m/s, since the car comes to a complete stop)\nu = initial velocity (50 m/s)\na = acceleration (deceleration in this case, so -5 m/s²)\ns = distance covered\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n0^2 = 50^2 + 2(-5)s\n\n0 = 2500 - 10s\n\n10s = 2500\n\ns = 2500 / 10\n\ns = 250 meters\n\nThe car covers a distance of 250 meters before coming to a complete stop."
