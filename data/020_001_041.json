    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces two types of chairs, A and B. Each chair A requires 3 kg of wood and 2 hours of labor, while each chair B requires 4 kg of wood and 3 hours of labor. The manufacturer has 300 kg of wood and 210 hours of labor available for production. Each chair A generates a profit of $15, while each chair B generates a profit of $20. How many chairs of each type should the manufacturer produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs of type A and y be the number of chairs of type B.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. Wood constraint: 3x + 4y ≤ 300\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 210\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 15x + 20y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities.\n\n1. Wood constraint:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 300\ny ≤ (300 - 3x) / 4\n\n2. Labor constraint:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 210\ny ≤ (210 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nA. Intersection of the wood constraint and the x-axis (y = 0):\n\n3x + 4(0) ≤ 300\nx ≤ 100\n\nSo, point A is (100, 0).\n\nB. Intersection of the labor constraint and the x-axis (y = 0):\n\n2x + 3(0) ≤ 210\nx ≤ 105\n\nSince x ≤ 100 from the wood constraint, point B is not in the feasible region.\n\nC. Intersection of the wood constraint and the y-axis (x = 0):\n\n3(0) + 4y ≤ 300\ny ≤ 75\n\nSo, point C is (0, 75).\n\nD. Intersection of the labor constraint and the y-axis (x = 0):\n\n2(0) + 3y ≤ 210\ny ≤ 70\n\nSince y ≤ 75 from the wood constraint, point D is not in the feasible region.\n\nE. Intersection of the wood constraint and the labor constraint:\n\n3x + 4y = 300\n2x + 3y = 210\n\nSolving this system of equations:\n\ny = (300 - 3x) / 4\n2x + 3((300 - 3x) / 4) = 210\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4:\n\n8x + 9(300 - 3x) = 840\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n8x + 2700 - 27x = 840\n-19x = -1860\nx = 98\n\nSubstituting x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (300 - 3(98)) / 4\ny = (300 - 294) / 4\ny = 6 / 4\ny = 1.5\n\nSo, point E is (98, 1.5).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of the corner points:\n\nP(A) = 15(100) + 20(0) = 1500\nP(C) = 15(0) + 20(75) = 1500\nP(E) = 15(98) + 20(1.5) = 1470 + 30 = 1500\n\nThe maximum profit is $1500, which can be achieved by producing 100 chairs of type A and 0 chairs of type B, or by producing 0 chairs of type A and 75 chairs of type B."
