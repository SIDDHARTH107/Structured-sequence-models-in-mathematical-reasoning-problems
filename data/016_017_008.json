    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal curve that is constructed by successively folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal length = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nFor n = 5, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nTotal length = 1 * (2^(5/2))\nTotal length = 1 * (2^2.5)\nTotal length = 1 * (√(2^5))\nTotal length = 1 * (√32)\nTotal length ≈ 5.656854\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 5th iteration is approximately 5.656854 units."
