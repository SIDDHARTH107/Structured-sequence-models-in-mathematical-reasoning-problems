    "message_1": "A circular pizza has a diameter of 20 inches. What is the perimeter of the slice if it has an angle of 45 degrees?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the pizza slice, we need to calculate the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza:\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 20 inches / 2 = 10 inches\n\nNow, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\nArc length (L) = (θ/360) × 2πr\nwhere θ is the angle in degrees and r is the radius.\n\nFor a 45-degree slice:\nArc length (L) = (45/360) × 2π(10 inches) = (1/8) × 20π inches = 5π inches\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter of the slice. The perimeter consists of the arc length and the two radii:\nPerimeter (P) = Arc length + 2 × Radius = 5π inches + 2 × 10 inches = 5π inches + 20 inches\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 45-degree pizza slice is 5π inches + 20 inches."
