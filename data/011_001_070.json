    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (8 in this case), k is the number of people to be selected (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nNow, plug these values back into the formula:\n\nC(8, 3) = 40,320 / (6 × 120)\n\nC(8, 3) = 40,320 / 720\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to select a committee of 3 members from a group of 8 people."
