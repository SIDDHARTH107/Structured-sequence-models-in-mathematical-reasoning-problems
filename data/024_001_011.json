    "message_1": "A space curve is represented by the vector function r(t) = (3t, 2t^2, 5t^3). Find the curvature and torsion of this curve at t=2.",
    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the vector function r(t) and then use the formulas for curvature (k) and torsion (τ).\n\nGiven r(t) = (3t, 2t^2, 5t^3), let's find the first and second derivatives:\n\nr'(t) = (dr/dt) = (d(3t)/dt, d(2t^2)/dt, d(5t^3)/dt) = (3, 4t, 15t^2)\nr''(t) = (d^2r/dt^2) = (d(3)/dt, d(4t)/dt, d(15t^2)/dt) = (0, 4, 30t)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product r'(t) x r''(t):\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (3, 4t, 15t^2) x (0, 4, 30t) = (120t^3 - 60t^2, -90t^4, 12t^2)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = √(3^2 + (4t)^2 + (15t^2)^2) = √(9 + 16t^2 + 225t^4)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = √((120t^3 - 60t^2)^2 + (-90t^4)^2 + (12t^2)^2) = √(14400t^6 - 14400t^5 + 3600t^4 + 8100t^8 + 144t^4)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature k(t):\n\nk(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3 = √(14400t^6 - 14400t^5 + 3600t^4 + 8100t^8 + 144t^4) / (9 + 16t^2 + 225t^4)^(3/2)\n\nTo find the curvature at t=2, we substitute t=2 into the expression for k(t):\n\nk(2) = √(14400(2)^6 - 14400(2)^5 + 3600(2)^4 + 8100(2)^8 + 144(2)^4) / (9 + 16(2)^2 + 225(2)^4)^(3/2)\nk(2) ≈ 0.0018\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ) using the formula:\n\nτ(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t) • r'''(t)) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the third derivative r'''(t):\n\nr'''(t) = (d^3r/dt^3) = (d(0)/dt, d(4)/dt, d(30t)/dt) = (0, 0, 30)\n\nNow, let's find the dot product (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t):\n\n(r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) = (120t^3 - 60t^2, -90t^4, 12t^2) • (0, 0, 30) = 360t^2\n\nNow, let's find the square of the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2 = (14400t^6 - 14400t^5 + 3600t^4 + 8100t^8 + 144t^4)^2\n\nNow, we can find the torsion τ(t):\n\nτ(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t) • r'''(t)) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2 = (360t^2) / (14400t^6 - 14400t^5 + 3600t^4 + 8100t^8 + 144t^4)^2\n\nTo find the torsion at t=2, we substitute t=2 into the expression for τ(t):\n\nτ(2) = (360(2)^2) / (14400(2)^6 - 14400(2)^5 + 3600(2)^4 + 8100(2)^8 + 144(2)^4)^2\nτ(2) ≈ -0.0003\n\nSo, the curvature k at t=2 is approximately 0.0018, and the torsion τ at t=2 is approximately -0.0003."
