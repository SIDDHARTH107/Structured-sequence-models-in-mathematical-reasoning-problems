    "message_1": "Consider a stock whose price is modeled by the stochastic differential equation: \n\ndS(t) = μS(t)dt + σS(t)dW(t)\n\nwhere S(t) represents the stock price at time t, μ is the constant drift rate, σ is the constant volatility rate, and dW(t) represents the increment of a Wiener process. Assume S(0)=100.\n\nIf the drift rate is 0.01 and the volatility rate is 0.2, what is the expected value of the stock price after 1 year?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the stock price after 1 year, we can use the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The solution to the SDE is given by the geometric Brownian motion:\n\nS(t) = S(0) * exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))\n\nwhere S(0) is the initial stock price, μ is the drift rate, σ is the volatility rate, t is the time, and W(t) is the Wiener process at time t.\n\nNow, we want to find the expected value of S(t) after 1 year, i.e., E[S(1)]. Since the expected value of the Wiener process E[W(t)] = 0, we have:\n\nE[S(1)] = E[S(0) * exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * 1 + σ * W(1))]\n         = S(0) * E[exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * 1 + σ * W(1))]\n         = S(0) * exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * 1) * E[exp(σ * W(1))]\n\nSince the expected value of the exponential of a Wiener process is 1, we have:\n\nE[S(1)] = S(0) * exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * 1)\n\nGiven the values S(0) = 100, μ = 0.01, and σ = 0.2, we can calculate the expected value of the stock price after 1 year:\n\nE[S(1)] = 100 * exp((0.01 - (0.2^2)/2) * 1)\n         = 100 * exp(-0.019)\n         ≈ 100 * 0.981\n         ≈ 98.1\n\nSo, the expected value of the stock price after 1 year is approximately $98.1."
