    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, which consists of the partial derivatives of the functions with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)) where f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4 and f2(x, y) = xy - 1. The Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x   2y |\n          |  y   x  |\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method iteratively using the following update rule:\n\n(x, y) <- (x, y) - J(x, y)^(-1) * F(x, y)\n\nWe start with the initial guess (1, 1) and iterate until the magnitude of F(x, y) is less than the tolerance 0.001. Here's the iteration process:\n\n1. Initial guess: (x, y) = (1, 1)\n2. Compute F(x, y) = (0, 0)\n3. Since the magnitude of F(x, y) is 0, which is less than the tolerance 0.001, we have found the solution: (x, y) = (1, 1).\n\nHowever, this solution is trivial and corresponds to the initial guess. To find the non-trivial solution, we can try a different initial guess, such as (x, y) = (2, 0.5). Here's the iteration process:\n\n1. Initial guess: (x, y) = (2, 0.5)\n2. Compute F(x, y) = (0, -0.5)\n3. Compute J(x, y)^(-1) * F(x, y) = (0.1, -0.2)\n4. Update (x, y) <- (x, y) - J(x, y)^(-1) * F(x, y) = (1.9, 0.7)\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the magnitude of F(x, y) is less than the tolerance 0.001.\n\nAfter a few iterations, we find the non-trivial solution (x, y) ≈ (1.618, 0.618), which is the solution to the system of equations within the given tolerance."
