    "message_1": "Suppose we want to conduct an experiment to test the effectiveness of a new fertilizer on plant growth. We have 20 identical plants that we divide into two sets of 10. We randomly assign five plants from one set to the control group and five plants from the other set to the treatment group. We apply the new fertilizer to the treatment group every day for 30 days, while we give no fertilizer to the control group. At the end of the experiment, we measure the height of each plant in centimeters.\n\nWhat is the mean height of the five plants in the treatment group?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mean height of the five plants in the treatment group, we need the height measurements of each plant in the treatment group. Please provide the height measurements of the five plants in the treatment group."
