    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the force vector, we can break it down into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components using trigonometry.\n\nThe horizontal component (x) can be found using the cosine function:\nx = magnitude * cos(angle)\nx = 25 * cos(60°)\n\nSince cos(60°) = 0.5, we have:\nx = 25 * 0.5\nx = 12.5 units\n\nThe vertical component (y) can be found using the sine function:\ny = magnitude * sin(angle)\ny = 25 * sin(60°)\n\nSince sin(60°) = √3/2, we have:\ny = 25 * (√3/2)\ny ≈ 21.65 units\n\nNow that we have the horizontal and vertical components, we can find the magnitude and direction of the force vector.\n\nMagnitude = √(x^2 + y^2)\nMagnitude = √(12.5^2 + 21.65^2)\nMagnitude ≈ √(156.25 + 468.92)\nMagnitude ≈ √625.17\nMagnitude ≈ 25 units\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the tangent function and the arctangent (inverse tangent) function:\ntan(angle) = y/x\nangle = arctan(y/x)\n\nangle = arctan(21.65/12.5)\nangle ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the force vector is 25 units, and its direction is 60° from the horizontal axis."
