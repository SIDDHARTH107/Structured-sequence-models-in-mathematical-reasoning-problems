    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (3x - 5)/(x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to directly substitute x = 2 into the function:\n\nf(2) = (3(2) - 5)/(2 - 2) = (6 - 5)/(0) = 1/0\n\nSince we cannot divide by zero, we need to find another way to evaluate the limit. We can try to factor the numerator and see if there's a common factor that can be canceled out with the denominator:\n\nf(x) = (3x - 5)/(x - 2)\n\nNotice that we can rewrite the numerator as a product of two factors:\n\n3x - 5 = 3(x - 2) + 1\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = (3(x - 2) + 1)/(x - 2)\n\nSince there's no common factor that can be canceled out, we can try to find the limit by using the properties of limits. The limit of a sum (or difference) is the sum (or difference) of the limits, and the limit of a product is the product of the limits:\n\nlim(x->2) f(x) = lim(x->2) [(3(x - 2) + 1)/(x - 2)]\n\nNow, we can separate the limit into two parts:\n\nlim(x->2) [(3(x - 2))/(x - 2)] + lim(x->2) [1/(x - 2)]\n\nThe first part of the limit can be simplified:\n\nlim(x->2) [(3(x - 2))/(x - 2)] = lim(x->2) [3]\n\nSince the limit of a constant is the constant itself, we have:\n\nlim(x->2) [3] = 3\n\nNow, let's look at the second part of the limit:\n\nlim(x->2) [1/(x - 2)]\n\nAs x approaches 2, the denominator (x - 2) approaches 0, and the limit becomes:\n\nlim(x->2) [1/(x - 2)] = 1/0\n\nSince we cannot divide by zero, this limit does not exist.\n\nTherefore, the overall limit of the function f(x) as x approaches 2 does not exist."
