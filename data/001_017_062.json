    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x-5) + log2(x) = 4, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation using the product rule, which states that logb(m) + logb(n) = logb(mn):\n\nlog2((x-5)x) = 4\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n2^4 = (x-5)x\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n16 = x^2 - 5x\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 5x - 16 = 0\n\nNow we can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = -16:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)^2 - 4(1)(-16))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 + 64)) / 2\n\nx = (5 ± √89) / 2\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (5 + √89) / 2 ≈ 7.581\nx = (5 - √89) / 2 ≈ -2.581\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with logarithms, we must consider the domain of the logarithmic functions. The arguments of both log2(x-5) and log2(x) must be greater than 0:\n\nx - 5 > 0 => x > 5\nx > 0\n\nThe only solution that satisfies these conditions is x ≈ 7.581."
