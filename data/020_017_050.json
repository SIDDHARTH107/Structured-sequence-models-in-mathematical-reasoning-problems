    "message_2": "To maximize the total area of the cut pieces, we need to minimize the waste produced when cutting the metal sheet. This can be achieved by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the dimensions of the metal sheet, which will give us the dimensions of the identical rectangular pieces.\n\nThe dimensions of the metal sheet are 10 meters and 6 meters. Let's find the GCD of these dimensions:\n\nGCD(10, 6)\n\n10 can be factored into 2 × 5\n6 can be factored into 2 × 3\n\nThe common factor is 2.\n\nSo, GCD(10, 6) = 2.\n\nNow, we can divide the dimensions of the metal sheet by the GCD to find the dimensions of the identical rectangular pieces:\n\n10 meters ÷ 2 = 5 meters\n6 meters ÷ 2 = 3 meters\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the identical rectangular pieces are 5 meters by 3 meters."
