    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, producing identical products with identical costs. The market demand curve is represented by Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price of the product. Both firms simultaneously choose the quantity they will produce. Using Cournot competition, calculate the quantity of product each firm should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Cournot competition, we need to find the reaction functions for both firms A and B. Let's denote the quantity produced by firm A as qA and the quantity produced by firm B as qB. The total quantity produced in the market, Q, is the sum of the quantities produced by both firms: Q = qA + qB.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse demand function, which gives us the price as a function of the total quantity produced. From the demand curve, we have:\n\nQ = 100 - 2P\n=> P = (100 - Q) / 2\n\nNow, let's find the profit functions for both firms. Assuming identical costs, let c be the cost per unit for both firms. The profit function for firm A is:\n\nπA = P * qA - c * qA\n\nSubstitute the inverse demand function into the profit function:\n\nπA = ((100 - Q) / 2) * qA - c * qA\n=> πA = ((100 - (qA + qB)) / 2) * qA - c * qA\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm A should choose qA such that the derivative of its profit function with respect to qA is equal to zero:\n\nd(πA) / dqA = 0\n\nTaking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\n(50 - qA - qB - c) - qA = 0\n=> 2qA + qB = 50 - c\n\nThis is the reaction function for firm A. Similarly, we can find the reaction function for firm B:\n\n2qB + qA = 50 - c\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of linear equations to find the Nash equilibrium quantities for both firms. We can use the substitution method:\n\nqA = (50 - c - 2qB) / 3\n\nSubstitute this expression for qA into the reaction function for firm B:\n\n2qB + ((50 - c - 2qB) / 3) = 50 - c\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n6qB + 50 - c - 2qB = 150 - 3c\n=> 4qB = 100 - 2c\n=> qB = (100 - 2c) / 4\n\nNow, substitute this expression for qB back into the expression for qA:\n\nqA = (50 - c - 2((100 - 2c) / 4)) / 3\n=> qA = (50 - c - (100 - 2c) / 2) / 3\n=> qA = (50 - c - 50 + c) / 3\n=> qA = (100 - 2c) / 4\n\nSo, both firms should produce the same quantity to maximize their profits:\n\nqA = qB = (100 - 2c) / 4"
