    "message_2": "To find the point Q on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - 7x + 10 over the finite field F11, we need to perform the point doubling operation on the given point P = (3, 4). \n\nThe point doubling formula for elliptic curves is given by:\n\nλ = (3x₁^2 + a) / 2y₁ (mod p)\nx₃ = λ^2 - 2x₁ (mod p)\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod p)\n\nwhere P = (x₁, y₁), Q = (x₃, y₃), a is the coefficient of the x term in the elliptic curve equation (in this case, -7), and p is the prime number of the finite field (in this case, 11).\n\nFirst, we compute λ:\n\nλ = (3 * (3^2) - 7) / (2 * 4) (mod 11)\nλ = (27 - 7) / 8 (mod 11)\nλ = 20 / 8 (mod 11)\nλ = 20 * 8^(-1) (mod 11)\n\nNow we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 8 modulo 11. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm for this:\n\ngcd(8, 11) = 1 = 8 * (-1) + 11 * 1\nSo, 8^(-1) (mod 11) = -1 (mod 11) = 10 (mod 11)\n\nNow we can compute λ:\n\nλ = 20 * 10 (mod 11)\nλ = 200 (mod 11)\nλ = 2 (mod 11)\n\nNext, we compute x₃:\n\nx₃ = λ^2 - 2x₁ (mod 11)\nx₃ = 2^2 - 2 * 3 (mod 11)\nx₃ = 4 - 6 (mod 11)\nx₃ = -2 (mod 11)\nx₃ = 9 (mod 11)\n\nFinally, we compute y₃:\n\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod 11)\ny₃ = 2(3 - 9) - 4 (mod 11)\ny₃ = 2(-6) - 4 (mod 11)\ny₃ = -12 - 4 (mod 11)\ny₃ = -16 (mod 11)\ny₃ = 6 (mod 11)\n\nSo, the point Q = (x₃, y₃) = (9, 6)."
