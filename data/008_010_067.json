    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. Then, we will use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 2 -4  2 | -6 |\n| 1  1  1 |  4 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R1\n\n| 3  2 -1 |  5    | 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 0 -8  4 | -10  | 0 -8  4 | -10|\n| 0 -1  4/3|  3   | 0 -1  4/3|  3 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 + (1/8)R2\n\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 0 -8  4 | -10|\n| 0  0  2 |  2 |\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. Let's use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n2z = 2\nz = 1\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n-8y + 4z = -10\n-8y + 4(1) = -10\n-8y = -14\ny = 7/4\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n3x + 2y - z = 5\n3x + 2(7/4) - 1 = 5\n3x + 7/2 - 1 = 5\n3x = 3/2\nx = 1/2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1/2, y = 7/4, and z = 1."
