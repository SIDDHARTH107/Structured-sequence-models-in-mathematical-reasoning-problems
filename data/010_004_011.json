    "message_2": "To determine if the set A is compact, we will use the sequential compactness definition of compactness, which states that a set is compact if and only if every sequence in the set has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in the set.\n\nConsider the sequence {1/n} in A, where n ∈ N. We will show that this sequence has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in A.\n\nThe sequence {1/n} is a decreasing sequence that converges to 0 as n approaches infinity. Since 0 is an element of A, we can say that the sequence {1/n} has a convergent subsequence (itself) that converges to a point in A (0).\n\nNow, we need to show that every sequence in A has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in A. Let {a_n} be an arbitrary sequence in A. There are two cases to consider:\n\n1. The sequence {a_n} has infinitely many distinct terms.\nIn this case, there must be a subsequence of {a_n} that converges to 0, since there are infinitely many terms of the form 1/n in A. As we showed earlier, the sequence {1/n} converges to 0, which is in A. Therefore, every sequence with infinitely many distinct terms in A has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in A.\n\n2. The sequence {a_n} has finitely many distinct terms.\nIn this case, there must be at least one term in {a_n} that appears infinitely often. Let a_k be such a term. Then, we can form a subsequence of {a_n} consisting only of the term a_k, which trivially converges to a_k. Since a_k is in A, every sequence with finitely many distinct terms in A has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in A.\n\nSince every sequence in A has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in A, we can conclude that the set A is compact."
