Could you come up with a similar example to prove that the statement is not true for other sets of real numbers, say an open interval (0,1) or a closed interval [0,1)?",
    "message_2": "To prove that the set of real numbers given by the interval [0,1] is connected, we need to show that it cannot be represented as a union of two nonempty disjoint open sets. Suppose, for contradiction, that [0,1] can be represented as a union of two nonempty disjoint open sets A and B. Let a = sup(A ∩ [0,1]) and b = inf(B ∩ [0,1]). Since A and B are disjoint, a ≠ b. Without loss of generality, assume a < b. Then, there exists an open interval (a - ε, a + ε) ⊆ A for some ε > 0. Since a is the supremum of A ∩ [0,1], there exists an element x ∈ A ∩ [0,1] such that a - ε/2 < x < a. Similarly, there exists an element y ∈ B ∩ [0,1] such that a < y < a + ε/2. But this contradicts the fact that A and B are disjoint, as x < y implies that (x, y) ⊆ [0,1] and (x, y) ⊆ A ∩ B. Therefore, [0,1] cannot be represented as a union of two nonempty disjoint open sets, and it is connected.\n\nTo prove that the set of real numbers given by the interval [0,1] is path-connected, we need to show that for any two points x, y ∈ [0,1], there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → [0,1] such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. Define the function f(t) = (1 - t)x + ty for t ∈ [0,1]. This function is continuous, as it is a linear combination of continuous functions. Moreover, f(0) = x and f(1) = y, so [0,1] is path-connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the open interval (0,1). This set is also connected and path-connected. To see this, note that any continuous function from a connected space to a disconnected space must be constant. The identity function on (0,1) is continuous and non-constant, so (0,1) must be connected. Similarly, we can use the same function f(t) = (1 - t)x + ty for t ∈ (0,1) to show that (0,1) is path-connected.\n\nHowever, the closed interval [0,1) is not connected. To see this, consider the open sets A = (0,1) and B = {1}. Then, [0,1) = A ∪ B, and A and B are disjoint open sets. Therefore, [0,1) is not connected. Note that this also implies that [0,1) is not path-connected, as path-connectedness implies connectedness."
