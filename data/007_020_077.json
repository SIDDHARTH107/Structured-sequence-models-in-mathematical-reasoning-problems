    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using the RSA algorithm and the public key (e, n) = (35, 77), we use the formula:\n\nciphertext = message^e mod n\n\nIn this case, the message is 22, e is 35, and n is 77. So, we have:\n\nciphertext = 22^35 mod 77\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\nciphertext = 64\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext for the message 22 is 64."
