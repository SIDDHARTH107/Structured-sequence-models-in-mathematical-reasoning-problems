What is the probability that a random sample of 25 adult males from this population will have an average height of less than 67 inches?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In this case, we have a normal distribution for the population, so the sample means will also be normally distributed.\n\nWe are given the population mean (μ) as 68 inches and the population standard deviation (σ) as 3 inches. We are also given the sample size (n) as 25 adult males. We want to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is less than 67 inches.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample means (σx̄). This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n\n\nσx̄ = 3 / √25\nσx̄ = 3 / 5\nσx̄ = 0.6\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 67 inches. The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σx̄\n\nz = (67 - 68) / 0.6\nz = -1 / 0.6\nz = -1.67\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability that a random sample of 25 adult males will have an average height of less than 67 inches. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability associated with a z-score of -1.67.\n\nLooking up the z-score of -1.67 in a z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.0475. \n\nSo, there is a 4.75% chance that a random sample of 25 adult males from this population will have an average height of less than 67 inches."
