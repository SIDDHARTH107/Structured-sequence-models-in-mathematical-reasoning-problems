    "message_1": "Consider the intuitionistic logic formula ¬(p ∨ q) → (¬p ∧ ¬q). If p is false and q is true, what is the truth value of the formula?",
    "message_2": "Given that p is false and q is true, let's evaluate the formula ¬(p ∨ q) → (¬p ∧ ¬q) step by step:\n\n1. ¬(p ∨ q): Since p is false and q is true, (p ∨ q) is true. Therefore, ¬(p ∨ q) is false.\n\n2. ¬p ∧ ¬q: Since p is false and q is true, ¬p is true and ¬q is false. Thus, (¬p ∧ ¬q) is false.\n\nNow, we have ¬(p ∨ q) → (¬p ∧ ¬q) as false → false. In intuitionistic logic, the implication A → B is true if either A is false or both A and B are true. Since A (¬(p ∨ q)) is false, the formula ¬(p ∨ q) → (¬p ∧ ¬q) is true."
