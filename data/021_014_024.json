    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B, using raw materials X and Y. Each product requires a different combination of raw materials, as shown in the table below: \n\n|   | Product A | Product B |\n|---|-----------|-----------|\n| X | 2 units   | 1 unit   |\n| Y | 1 unit   | 3 units   |\n\nThe company has a daily supply of 10 units of X and 8 units of Y. \nThe profit for each unit of product A is $5 and for each unit of product B is $4. Using genetic algorithms, determine the optimal daily production plan to maximise the total profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using genetic algorithms, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate an initial population of possible solutions (daily production plans).\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution (total profit).\n3. Select the best solutions for reproduction (crossover and mutation).\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the optimal solution is found or a stopping criterion is met.\n\nStep 1: Generate an initial population\nLet's generate an initial population of 10 possible daily production plans (chromosomes), where each chromosome represents the number of units of product A and product B to be produced:\n\n1.

(1, 0): 2(1) + 1(0) <= 10 and 1(1) + 3(0) <= 8 -> 1(5) + 0(4) = $5\n\nStep 3: Select the best solutions for reproduction\nWe will select the top 5 solutions based on their total profit:\n\n1. (4, 0): $20\n2. (3, 1): $19\n3. (2, 2): $18\n4. (3, 0): $15\n5. (2, 1): $14\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3\nWe will perform crossover and mutation on the selected solutions to generate a new population and repeat steps 2 and 3 until the optimal solution is found or a stopping criterion is met. In this case, we can stop after one iteration, as the optimal solution has been found.\n\nThe optimal daily production plan to maximize the total profit is to produce 4 units of product A and 0 units of product B, resulting in a total profit of $20."
