    "message_2": "Determining the exact treewidth of a graph is an NP-hard problem, which means there is no known efficient algorithm to compute it. However, we can provide an upper bound for the treewidth based on the number of vertices and edges.\n\nThe treewidth of a graph is at most one less than the minimum degree of its vertex. In a graph G with 20 vertices and 35 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 35) / 20 = 3.5. Since the average degree is 3.5, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph G is at most 2.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact treewidth."
