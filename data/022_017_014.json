    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation using complex analysis, we first rewrite the equation in the form of an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\n$\\displaystyle \\mu(x) = e^{\\int \\frac{1}{x-1} dx}$\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n$\\displaystyle \\mu(x) = e^{\\ln |x-1|} = |x-1|$\n\nNow, we multiply the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\n$\\displaystyle |x-1| \\frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0$\n\nNotice that the left-hand side of the equation is the derivative of the product of $y$ and the integrating factor:\n\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx} (y|x-1|) = 0$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$\\displaystyle y|x-1| = C$\n\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Now, we use the initial condition $y(2) = -1$ to find the value of $C$:\n\n$\\displaystyle -1 \\cdot |2-1| = C \\Rightarrow C = -1$\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\n$\\displaystyle y = \\frac{-1}{|x-1|}$\n\nFinally, we find the value of $y$ when $x = 3$:\n\n$\\displaystyle y(3) = \\frac{-1}{|3-1|} = \\frac{-1}{2}$\n\nThus, the value of $y$ when $x = 3$ is $\\displaystyle \\frac{-1}{2}$."
