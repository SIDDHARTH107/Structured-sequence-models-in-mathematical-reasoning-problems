    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the symmetric difference of A and B. Show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we will show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product. To do this, we will find the Cartesian product of A Δ B and B Δ A, and show that they are not equal.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\nB Δ A = {1, 4}\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nSince (A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = (B Δ A) x (A Δ B), the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to the Cartesian product. However, this is not what we were asked to prove. The question seems to have a mistake in it, as the symmetric difference of A and B is actually commutative with respect to the Cartesian product in this case."
