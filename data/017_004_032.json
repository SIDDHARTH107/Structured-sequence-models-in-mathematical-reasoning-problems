    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2), we can apply the Sylow Theorems. In particular, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 25\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Let H be this normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Since H is of order 5, it is cyclic, generated by some element h of order 5.\n\nNow, let g be any element in G. Since the order of G is 25, the order of g must be either 1, 5, or 25. If the order of g is 1, then g is the identity element. If the order of g is 5, then g is in a Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be H since H is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, G is generated by the elements of H, and G is cyclic.\n\nIf the order of g is 25, then G is generated by g and is cyclic. So in either case, G is cyclic.\n\nNow, suppose n_5 = 25. Then there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let H and K be two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups. Since they are both of order 5, they are cyclic. Let h be a generator of H and k be a generator of K. \n\nSince H and K are distinct, their intersection must be the identity element. Thus, hk = kh. Now, consider the subgroup generated by h and k, denoted by <h, k>. Since hk = kh, the elements of <h, k> can be written in the form h^i k^j for i, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. There are 5 * 5 = 25 such elements, and since the order of G is 25, <h, k> = G.\n\nNow, we can define a homomorphism φ: G → H × K by φ(h^i k^j) = (h^i, k^j). This homomorphism is clearly surjective, and its kernel is the set of elements that map to the identity of H × K, which is (h^0, k^0). Since the intersection of H and K is the identity element, the kernel of φ is trivial, and φ is an isomorphism.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, H × K. In conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
