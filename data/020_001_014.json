    "message_1": "A farmer has 60 acres of land and wants to plant wheat and corn. Each acre of wheat requires 2 hours of labor and yields a profit of $300, while each acre of corn requires 3 hours of labor and yields a profit of $200. The farmer has 180 hours of labor available. How many acres of wheat and corn should the farmer plant in order to maximize profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of corn.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. The total acres of land constraint: x + y ≤ 60\n2. The total hours of labor constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 180\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function: P(x, y) = 300x + 200y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for the constraints. We can rewrite the constraints as follows:\n\n1. y ≤ 60 - x\n2. y ≤ (180 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we need to find the corner points of the feasible region. These are the points where the constraints intersect. We have three intersections:\n\n1. Intersection of the two constraints:\n   x + y = 60\n   2x + 3y = 180\n   Solving this system of equations, we get x = 60 and y = 0.\n\n2. Intersection of the first constraint with the y-axis (x = 0):\n   y = 60 - x\n   y = 60 - 0\n   y = 60\n\n3. Intersection of the second constraint with the x-axis (y = 0):\n   y = (180 - 2x) / 3\n   0 = (180 - 2x) / 3\n   2x = 180\n   x = 90\n\nHowever, the third intersection (x = 90, y = 0) is not within the feasible region since it exceeds the 60-acre limit. So, we only have two corner points to consider: (60, 0) and (0, 60).\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at these corner points:\n\n1. P(60, 0) = 300(60) + 200(0) = 18000\n2. P(0, 60) = 300(0) + 200(60) = 12000\n\nSince the profit at (60, 0) is higher, the farmer should plant 60 acres of wheat and 0 acres of corn to maximize profits, which will result in a profit of $18,000."
