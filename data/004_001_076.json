    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 3, we will apply the power rule for derivatives. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, let's find the derivative of each term in the function:\n\n1. The derivative of 2x^3:\n   Using the power rule, we have (3)(2)x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n\n2. The derivative of 5x^2:\n   Using the power rule, we have (2)(5)x^(2-1) = 10x.\n\n3. The derivative of -4x:\n   Using the power rule, we have (1)(-4)x^(1-1) = -4.\n\n4. The derivative of the constant term 3 is 0, as the derivative of any constant is 0.\n\nNow, let's combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2)^2 + 10(2) - 4\nf'(2) = 6(4) + 20 - 4\nf'(2) = 24 + 20 - 4\nf'(2) = 40\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 3 at x = 2 is 40."
