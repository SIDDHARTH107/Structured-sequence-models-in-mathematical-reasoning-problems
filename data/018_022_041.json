    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Compute the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) × A and B × (A ∆ B), and show that they are not equal, thereby proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's compute the Cartesian products (A ∆ B) × A and B × (A ∆ B).\n\n(A ∆ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nB × (A ∆ B) = {(2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A ∆ B) × A ≠ B × (A ∆ B)\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product."
