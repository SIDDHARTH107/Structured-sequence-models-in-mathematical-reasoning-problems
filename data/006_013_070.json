    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is used to model the number of events (in this case, Category 4 or stronger hurricanes) occurring in a fixed interval of time (5 years).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events in the interval\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nSince we are given that the average number of Category 4 or stronger hurricanes hitting the U.S. East Coast is 1 every 10 years, we can calculate the average number of such hurricanes in a 5-year interval:\n\nλ = (1 hurricane / 10 years) * 5 years = 0.5 hurricanes\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least one Category 4 or stronger hurricane hitting the specific region in the next 5 years. To do this, we can find the probability of no hurricanes (k = 0) and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nUsing the Poisson distribution formula with k = 0:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.5) * 0.5^0) / 0! = e^(-0.5) * 1 / 1 = e^(-0.5)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of at least one Category 4 or stronger hurricane:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - e^(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935\n\nSo, the probability of a Category 4 or stronger hurricane hitting the specific region on the U.S. East Coast in the next 5 years is approximately 39.35%."
