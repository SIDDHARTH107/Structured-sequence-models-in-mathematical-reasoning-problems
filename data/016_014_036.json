    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-similar fractal, and its Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, it can be divided into 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), each of which is scaled down by a factor of √2 (s = √2).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Lévy C curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(√2) ≈ 2\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 2."
