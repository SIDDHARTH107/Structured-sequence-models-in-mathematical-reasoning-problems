    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature (K) of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 5, so the Gaussian curvature is:\n\nK = 1/5^2 = 1/25\n\nNow, let's relate this to the total curvature of the sphere using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total curvature of a closed surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface:\n\nTotal curvature = 2πχ\n\nFor a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2:\n\nχ = 2\n\nSo the total curvature of the sphere is:\n\nTotal curvature = 2π(2) = 4π\n\nNow, we can relate the Gaussian curvature to the total curvature by integrating the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface of the sphere. The surface area (A) of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = 4πR^2\n\nFor our sphere with radius 5, the surface area is:\n\nA = 4π(5^2) = 100π\n\nNow, we can integrate the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface of the sphere:\n\n∫K dA = (1/25) * 100π = 4π\n\nAs we can see, the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface of the sphere is equal to the total curvature as given by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n4π = 4π"
