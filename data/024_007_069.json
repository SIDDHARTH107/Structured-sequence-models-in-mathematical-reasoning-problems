Given a curve $\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ parameterized by arc length, find the components of the Riemann curvature tensor $R_{ijkl}$ at the point $(0,0)$, where $i,j,k,l$ vary from $1$ to $2$ and $i<j$ and $k<l$. Assume that the Frenet frame $(T,N)$ at $(0,0)$ has $T(0,0)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,1)$ and $N(0,0)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,-1)$.",
    "message_2": "In a 2-dimensional hyperbolic plane with constant curvature -1, the Riemann curvature tensor has only one independent component, which can be expressed as $R_{1212}$. The other components are either zero or can be obtained from this component using the symmetries and anti-symmetries of the Riemann tensor.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor in a 2-dimensional space can be written as:\n\n$R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$\n\nwhere $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, and $g_{ij}$ is the metric tensor. In our case, the Gaussian curvature is -1.\n\nThe metric tensor for the hyperbolic plane can be written in the form:\n\n$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we can compute the only non-zero component of the Riemann curvature tensor:\n\n$R_{1212} = K(g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21}) = (-1)(1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0) = -1$\n\nThus, the Riemann curvature tensor for the given 2-dimensional hyperbolic plane at the point (0,0) is:\n\n$R_{ijkl} = \\begin{cases} -1, & \\text{if }(i,j,k,l) = (1,2,1,2) \\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$"
