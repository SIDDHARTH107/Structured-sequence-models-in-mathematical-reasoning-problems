    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle/360°) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 8 cm and the central angle is 60°. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60°/360°) × 2π(8 cm)\nArc length = (1/6) × 16π cm\nArc length = 16π/6 cm\nArc length = 8π/3 cm\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the two radii (each 8 cm) to the arc length:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = (8π/3 cm) + 2(8 cm)\nPerimeter = (8π/3 cm) + 16 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (8π/3 cm) + 16 cm."
