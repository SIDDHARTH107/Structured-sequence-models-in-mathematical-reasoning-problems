    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the very center cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a level-4 Menger sponge, the process is repeated 4 times. The total number of cubes in a Menger sponge can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the level of the Menger sponge.\n\nFor a level-4 Menger sponge:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^4 = 160,000\n\nSo, there are 160,000 cubes in a level-4 Menger sponge."
