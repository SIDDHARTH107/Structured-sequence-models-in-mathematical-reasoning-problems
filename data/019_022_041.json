    "message_1": "A university offers two different scholarship options to its students, Scholarship A and Scholarship B. Scholarship A offers $2000 per year for 4 years while Scholarship B offers $3000 per year for 2 years. Which scholarship option would a student prefer if they plan to stay in the university for 4 years and aim to get maximum financial benefit?",
    "message_2": "To determine which scholarship option provides the maximum financial benefit, we need to calculate the total amount of money a student would receive from each scholarship over the 4 years they plan to stay in the university.\n\nScholarship A:\n$2000 per year for 4 years\nTotal amount = $2000 * 4 = $8000\n\nScholarship B:\n$3000 per year for 2 years\nTotal amount = $3000 * 2 = $6000\n\nComparing the total amounts, Scholarship A provides $8000 while Scholarship B provides $6000. Therefore, a student aiming to get the maximum financial benefit should prefer Scholarship A, as it offers more money over the 4 years they plan to stay in the university."
