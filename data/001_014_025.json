    "message_2": "To simplify the expression $\\sqrt{12}$, we can break down the number 12 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root.\n\nThe prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. Now we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$\\sqrt{12} = \\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3}$\n\nAccording to the properties of square roots, we can separate the factors under the square root:\n\n$\\sqrt{12} = \\sqrt{2^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$\n\nSince $\\sqrt{2^2} = 2$, the simplified expression is:\n\n$\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$"
