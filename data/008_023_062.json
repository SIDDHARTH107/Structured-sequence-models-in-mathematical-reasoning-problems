    "message_1": "Suppose you have a system of linear equations with 3 unknowns x, y and z, given by the following equations:\n\n2x - 3y + z = 7.4\n4x + 2y + 3z = 14.2 \n3x + y - 2z = 2.8\n\nHowever, the data is noisy and has some errors. The actual values of the constants in the equations have been randomly perturbed. The perturbations are normally distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.2. \n\nFind the values of x, y and z that best approximate the true solution of the system of equations, given the noisy data.",
    "message_2": "To find the best approximate solution for the system of equations given the noisy data, we can first solve the system of equations as is, and then discuss the impact of the noise on the solution.\n\nWe can solve the system of equations using the Gaussian elimination method or any other method. Let's use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, write the augmented matrix for the system of equations:\n\n| 2 -3  1 | 7.4\n| 4  2  3 | 14.2\n| 3  1 -2 | 2.8\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 1.5 * R1\n\n|  2  -3   1  |  7.4\n|  0   8   1  | -0.6\n|  0   5.5 -3.5| -8.3\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - (5.5/8) * R2\n\n|  2  -3   1  |  7.4\n|  0   8   1  | -0.6\n|  0   0  -4.5| -8.25\n\nStep 3: Solve for z, y, and x.\n\nz = -8.25 / (-4.5) = 1.8333\ny = (-0.6 - 1 * z) / 8 = 0.1042\nx = (7.4 + 3 * y - z) / 2 = 2.5313\n\nSo, the approximate solution for the system of equations is x = 2.5313, y = 0.1042, and z = 1.8333.\n\nNow, let's discuss the impact of the noise on the solution. Since the perturbations are normally distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.2, the true values of the constants in the equations might be slightly different from the given values. However, the solution we found (x = 2.5313, y = 0.1042, z = 1.8333) should still be a reasonable approximation of the true solution, as the noise is relatively small compared to the constants in the equations. To get a more accurate solution, one would need more information about the true values of the constants or additional constraints on the system."
