    "message_2": "To find the non-trivial symmetries of the given manifold, we need to find the Killing vector fields that satisfy the Killing equation:\n\n∇_μ K_ν + ∇_ν K_μ = 0\n\nwhere ∇ is the covariant derivative and K is the Killing vector field. The metric tensor is given by:\n\ng = (1+x^2)dx^2 + (1+y^2)dy^2 + (1+z^2)dz^2\n\nThe components of the metric tensor are:\n\ng_11 = 1+x^2, g_22 = 1+y^2, g_33 = 1+z^2, and all other components are zero.\n\nNow we compute the Christoffel symbols Γ^k_ij, which are given by:\n\nΓ^k_ij = (1/2)g^(kl)(∂_i g_lj + ∂_j g_il - ∂_l g_ij)\n\nSince the metric tensor is diagonal, the inverse metric tensor g^(ij) is also diagonal with components:\n\ng^11 = 1/(1+x^2), g^22 = 1/(1+y^2), g^33 = 1/(1+z^2)\n\nNow we compute the non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n\nΓ^1_12 = (1/2)g^11(∂_1 g_22) = (1/2)(1/(1+x^2))(-2x) = -x/(1+x^2)\nΓ^1_21 = Γ^1_12 = -x/(1+x^2)\nΓ^2_23 = (1/2)g^22(∂_2 g_33) = (1/2)(1/(1+y^2))(-2y) = -y/(1+y^2)\nΓ^2_32 = Γ^2_23 = -y/(1+y^2)\nΓ^3_31 = (1/2)g^33(∂_3 g_11) = (1/2)(1/(1+z^2))(-2z) = -z/(1+z^2)\nΓ^3_13 = Γ^3_31 = -z/(1+z^2)\n\nNow we can write down the Killing equation:\n\n∇_μ K_ν + ∇_ν K_μ = 0\n\nExpanding the covariant derivatives, we get:\n\n∂_μ K_ν + Γ^k_μν K_k + ∂_ν K_μ + Γ^k_νμ K_k = 0\n\nWe can write this equation in components:\n\n(∂_i K_j + Γ^k_ij K_k) + (∂_j K_i + Γ^k_ji K_k) = 0\n\nNow we can plug in the Christoffel symbols and solve the system of equations for the components of the Killing vector field K_i. After some algebra, we find that there are no non-trivial solutions for K_i, which means that the given manifold has no non-trivial symmetries."
