    "message_2": "To simplify the rational expression (5x^2 - 10x) / (15x - 30), we can first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n5x^2 - 10x = 5x(x - 2)\n\nDenominator:\n15x - 30 = 15(x - 2)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(5x(x - 2)) / (15(x - 2))\n\nSince (x - 2) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(5x) / (15)\n\nNow, we can simplify the remaining expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n\n(5x) / (15) = x / 3\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\nx / 3"
