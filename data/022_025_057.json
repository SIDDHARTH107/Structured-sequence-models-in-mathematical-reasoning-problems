    "message_2": "To solve the given complex Schrödinger equation, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$$\\psi(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we will substitute this into the given equation and separate the variables:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2} + 2i\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t} + 3x\\psi = X''(x)T(t) + 2iX(x)T'(t) + 3xX(x)T(t) = 0$$\n\nDivide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + 3x + 2i\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = 0$$\n\nNow, we have two terms depending on $x$ and one term depending on $t$. Since the left-hand side of the equation must be equal to zero for all $x$ and $t$, the terms depending on $x$ and $t$ must be equal to constants. Let's denote these constants as follows:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + 3x = -\\lambda$$\n$$2i\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\lambda$$\n\nNow, we have two separate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for $X(x)$ and $T(t)$. Let's solve them one by one.\n\n1) For $X(x)$:\n\n$$X''(x) + (3x - \\lambda)X(x) = 0$$\n\nThis is a linear ODE with variable coefficients, and its general solution cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, we can use the initial condition $\\psi(x,0) = e^{-x^2}$ to find the specific solution for this problem:\n\n$$X(x)T(0) = e^{-x^2}$$\n\nSince $T(0) \\neq 0$, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = e^{-x^2}$$\n\n2) For $T(t)$:\n\n$$2i\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\lambda$$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE. To solve it, we can integrate both sides:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dT}{T} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2i} \\int dt$$\n\nTaking the antiderivative, we get:\n\n$$\\ln{T(t)} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2i}t + C$$\n\nExponentiating both sides, we obtain:\n\n$$T(t) = e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2i}t + C} = e^C e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2i}t}$$\n\nSince $e^C$ is just a constant, we can absorb it into the constant $\\lambda$ and write:\n\n$$T(t) = e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2i}t}$$\n\nNow, we can combine the solutions for $X(x)$ and $T(t)$ to obtain the solution for the original complex Schrödinger equation:\n\n$$\\psi(x, t) = X(x)T(t) = e^{-x^2} e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2i}t}$$\n\nHowever, we still need to determine the value of $\\lambda$. To do this, we will use the second initial condition $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$. Taking the partial derivative of $\\psi(x, t)$ with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t}(x,t) = -x^2 e^{-x^2} e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2i}t} \\frac{\\lambda}{2i}$$\n\nNow, we can apply the initial condition:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t}(x,0) = -x^2 e^{-x^2} e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2i}(0)} \\frac{\\lambda}{2i} = 0$$\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we have:\n\n$$\\lambda = 0$$\n\nThus, the solution to the complex Schrödinger equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\n$$\\psi(x, t) = e^{-x^2}$$"
