    "message_1": "Consider the following linear logic formula:  (A ⊗ B) ⊸ C. If A is true 80% of the time and B is true 50% of the time, what is the probability that C is true?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that C is true, we first need to find the probability that both A and B are true, since the formula is (A ⊗ B) ⊸ C. \n\nThe probability of A and B both being true is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4\n\nNow, we know that if (A ⊗ B) is true, then C must be true as well, according to the formula. Therefore, the probability that C is true is equal to the probability that both A and B are true:\n\nP(C) = P(A and B) = 0.4\n\nSo, the probability that C is true is 40%."
