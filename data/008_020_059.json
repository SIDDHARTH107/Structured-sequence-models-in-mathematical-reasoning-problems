    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the method of elimination, we will first eliminate one variable from two of the equations, and then eliminate the same variable from the other two equations. Finally, we will solve the resulting system of two equations with two variables.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate y from equations 1 and 2.\nMultiply equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n4x - 2y + 6z = 16 (1*2)\n4x + 2y + 2z = 12 (2)\n\nAdd the equations:\n\n8x + 8z = 28 (3)\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from equations 1 and 3.\nMultiply equation 1 by 4 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n8x - 4y + 12z = 32 (1*4)\n6x + 4y - z = 10 (3)\n\nAdd the equations:\n\n14x + 11z = 42 (4)\n\nStep 3: Solve the resulting system of two equations with two variables (equations 3 and 4).\nMultiply equation 3 by 11 and equation 4 by 8 to make the coefficients of x equal:\n\n88x + 88z = 308 (3*11)\n112x + 88z = 336 (4*8)\n\nSubtract equation 3 from equation 4:\n\n24x = 28\n\nDivide by 24:\n\nx = 7/6\n\nStep 4: Substitute the value of x back into equation 3 to find the value of z:\n\n8(7/6) + 8z = 28\n\n56/6 + 8z = 28\n\nz = 2\n\nStep 5: Substitute the values of x and z back into equation 1 to find the value of y:\n\n2(7/6) - y + 3(2) = 8\n\n7/3 - y + 6 = 8\n\ny = 1/3\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 7/6, y = 1/3, and z = 2."
