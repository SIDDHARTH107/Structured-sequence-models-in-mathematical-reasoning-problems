What is the probability that a randomly chosen sample of 25 chocolate bars will have a mean weight between 83 and 87 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the information, we have:\n\nPopulation mean (μ) = 85 grams\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 3 grams\nSample size (n) = 25\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean), which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nσ_sample_mean = 3 / √25 = 3 / 5 = 0.6 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of sample mean weights (83 and 87 grams). The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor the lower limit (83 grams):\n\nz1 = (83 - 85) / 0.6 = -2 / 0.6 = -3.33\n\nFor the upper limit (87 grams):\n\nz2 = (87 - 85) / 0.6 = 2 / 0.6 = 3.33\n\nNow, we need to find the probability between these two z-scores. We can use a standard normal distribution table (z-table) or a calculator to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(z1) = P(z = -3.33) ≈ 0.0004\nP(z2) = P(z = 3.33) ≈ 0.9996\n\nThe probability of the sample mean being between 83 and 87 grams is the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(83 < x < 87) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.9996 - 0.0004 = 0.9992\n\nSo, there is approximately a 99.92% chance that a randomly chosen sample of 25 chocolate bars will have a mean weight between 83 and 87 grams."
