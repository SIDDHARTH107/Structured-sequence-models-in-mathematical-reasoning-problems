    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $4, and the profit per unit of product B is $6. The factory has 400 hours of labor available each week. Product A requires 2 hours of labor per unit, and Product B requires 3 hours of labor per unit. What is the optimal number of units of each product that the factory should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit function can be represented as:\nP(x, y) = 4x + 6y\n\nThe labor constraint can be represented as:\n2x + 3y ≤ 400\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the labor constraint.\n\nFirst, let's express y in terms of x using the labor constraint:\ny ≤ (400 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. To do this, we'll find the partial derivatives of P(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\n∂P/∂x = 4\n∂P/∂y = 6\n\nSince the partial derivatives are constants, there are no critical points in the interior of the feasible region. Therefore, the maximum profit must occur on the boundary of the feasible region.\n\nWe'll now examine the boundary of the feasible region by considering the following cases:\n\n1. x = 0: In this case, y = 400 / 3 ≈ 133.33. However, y must be an integer, so we'll consider y = 133 and y = 134.\n   - If y = 133, P(0, 133) = 4 * 0 + 6 * 133 = $798\n   - If y = 134, P(0, 134) = 4 * 0 + 6 * 134 = $804\n\n2. y = 0: In this case, x = 400 / 2 = 200.\n   - P(200, 0) = 4 * 200 + 6 * 0 = $800\n\n3. 2x + 3y = 400: We'll find the integer solutions for x and y that satisfy this equation.\n   - If x = 1, y = (400 - 2 * 1) / 3 ≈ 132.67, which is not an integer.\n   - If x = 2, y = (400 - 2 * 2) / 3 = 132, which is an integer.\n     - P(2, 132) = 4 * 2 + 6 * 132 = $800\n\nComparing the profit values for each case, we find that the maximum profit occurs when x = 200 and y = 0 or when x = 2 and y = 132, both yielding a profit of $800. Therefore, the factory should produce either 200 units of product A and 0 units of product B or 2 units of product A and 132 units of product B to maximize their profit."
