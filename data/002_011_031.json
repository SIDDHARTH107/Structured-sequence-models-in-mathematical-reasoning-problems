    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 5 cm and a height of length 12 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's denote the base as a, the height as b, and the hypotenuse as c. \n\na = 5 cm\nb = 12 cm\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc² = a² + b²\nc² = (5 cm)² + (12 cm)²\nc² = 25 cm² + 144 cm²\nc² = 169 cm²\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √(169 cm²)\nc = 13 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 13 cm."
