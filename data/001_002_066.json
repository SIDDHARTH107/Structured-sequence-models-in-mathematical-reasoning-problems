    "message_2": "To find the slope (m) of the line passing through the points (3,5) and (-2,1), we can use the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (3, 5) and (x2, y2) = (-2, 1).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nm = (1 - 5) / (-2 - 3)\nm = (-4) / (-5)\nm = 4/5\n\nSo, the slope of the line is 4/5.\n\nNow, to find the y-intercept (b), we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nWe can use either point, so let's use (3, 5):\n\ny - 5 = (4/5)(x - 3)\n\nNow, we want to find the value of y when x = 0 (i.e., the y-intercept):\n\ny - 5 = (4/5)(0 - 3)\ny - 5 = (-4/5)(3)\ny - 5 = -12/5\n\nAdding 5 to both sides:\n\ny = -12/5 + 5\ny = -12/5 + 25/5\ny = 13/5\n\nSo, the y-intercept is 13/5.\n\nIn summary, the slope of the line is 4/5, and the y-intercept is 13/5."
