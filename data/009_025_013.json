    "message_1": "Suppose a stock has a current market price of $100 and a Striking option price of $110. The stock's volatility is modeled by a process in which the standard deviation of the change in the stock per year is $0.4S_t$, where $S_t$ is the stock price at time t. Assume that the risk-free interest rate is 3%. Use the Black-Scholes-Merton model to find the price of a call option with a maturity date of six months.",
    "message_2": "To find the price of a call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton model, we need to use the following formula:\n\nC = S_t * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = price of the call option\nS_t = current stock price\nX = strike price of the option\nr = risk-free interest rate\nT = time to maturity (in years)\nN(d1) and N(d2) are the cumulative distribution functions of the standard normal distribution for d1 and d2, respectively.\n\nd1 = (ln(S_t / X) + (r + (σ^2 / 2)) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nS_t = $100\nX = $110\nr = 0.03\nT = 0.5 (since 6 months is half a year)\nσ = 0.4 * S_t (volatility)\n\nFirst, let's find the value of σ:\nσ = 0.4 * 100 = 40\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\nd1 = (ln(100 / 110) + (0.03 + (40^2 / 2)) * 0.5) / (40 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 = (ln(0.9091) + (0.03 + 800) * 0.5) / (40 * 0.7071)\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 400.015) / 28.2843\nd1 = 0.0110\n\nd2 = 0.0110 - 40 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 = 0.0110 - 28.2843\nd2 = -28.2733\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2). We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find these values:\n\nN(d1) = N(0.0110) ≈ 0.5044\nN(d2) = N(-28.2733) ≈ 0 (since it's far in the left tail of the distribution)\n\nFinally, let's calculate the price of the call option (C):\n\nC = 100 * 0.5044 - 110 * e^(-0.03 * 0.5) * 0\nC = 50.44\n\nSo, the price of the call option with a maturity date of six months is approximately $50.44."
