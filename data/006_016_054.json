    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring in a batch of 1000 products is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 50 but not more than 60 products in a randomly selected batch of 1000 products will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k! * (n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of products (1000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective products (we want to find the probability for 50 to 60 defective products)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (0.05)\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 50 but not more than 60 defective products, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 50, 51, ..., 60.\n\nP(50 ≤ X ≤ 60) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 50 to 60\n\nP(50 ≤ X ≤ 60) = P(X = 50) + P(X = 51) + ... + P(X = 60)\n\nNow, we can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(50 ≤ X ≤ 60) ≈ 0.136 + 0.126 + 0.109 + 0.089 + 0.069 + 0.050 + 0.033 + 0.020 + 0.011 + 0.006 + 0.003\n\nP(50 ≤ X ≤ 60) ≈ 0.652\n\nSo, the probability that at least 50 but not more than 60 products in a randomly selected batch of 1000 products will have this type of defect is approximately 0.652 or 65.2%."
