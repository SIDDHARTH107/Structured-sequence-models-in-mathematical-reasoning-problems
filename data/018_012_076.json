A×B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA×B = {(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2)}\n\nNow, let's calculate (A×B) ∩ B. This is the set of elements that are common in both A×B and B. Since B contains single elements and A×B contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements between the two sets.\n\n(A×B) ∩ B = ∅ (empty set)\n\nNext, let's find B ∩ {1}. This is the set of elements that are common in both B and {1}.\n\nB ∩ {1} = {1}\n\nNow, let's calculate A × (B ∩ {1}). This is the Cartesian product of A and the set {1}.\n\nA × (B ∩ {1}) = {(0,1), (1,1)}\n\nNow, we can compare (A×B) ∩ B and A × (B ∩ {1}):\n\n(A×B) ∩ B = ∅\nA × (B ∩ {1}) = {(0,1), (1,1)}\n\nSince (A×B) ∩ B ≠ A × (B ∩ {1}), we have shown that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
