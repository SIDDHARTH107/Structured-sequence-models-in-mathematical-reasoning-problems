    "message_2": "First, we write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 3  2 -1 |  4\n| 2 -4  6 | -2\n| 1  1  1 |  3\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we can replace the second row with the result of (-2/3) times the first row plus the second row:\n\n```\n| 3   2  -1 |  4\n| 0  -8   8 | -6\n| 1   1   1 |  3\n```\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we can replace the third row with the result of (-1/3) times the first row plus the third row:\n\n```\n| 3   2  -1 |  4\n| 0  -8   8 | -6\n| 0  -1   4 |  1\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we can replace the third row with the result of (1/8) times the second row plus the third row:\n\n```\n| 3   2  -1 |  4\n| 0  -8   8 | -6\n| 0   0   4 |  0\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nNow we have a triangular matrix, so we can solve for z by dividing the third row by 4:\n\n```\n| 3   2  -1 |  4\n| 0  -8   8 | -6\n| 0   0   1 |  0\n```\n\nSo, z = 0.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow we can substitute z back into the second row and solve for y:\n\n-8y + 8(0) = -6\n-8y = -6\ny = 3/4\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we can substitute y and z back into the first row and solve for x:\n\n3x + 2(3/4) - 0 = 4\n3x + 3/2 = 4\n3x = 5/2\nx = 5/6\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 5/6, y = 3/4, and z = 0."
