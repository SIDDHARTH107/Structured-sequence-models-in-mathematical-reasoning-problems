    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of faces the graph can have, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. In this case, we have V = 10 and E = 25. We can solve for F:\n\n10 - 25 + F = 2\nF = 17\n\nHowever, this assumes the graph is planar. To check if the graph is planar, we can use the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case:\n\n25 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n25 ≤ 24\n\nSince 25 is not less than or equal to 24, the graph is not planar. Therefore, the minimum number of faces the graph can have is not 17.\n\nTo find the genus of the graph, we can use the formula:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nwhere g is the genus. Rearranging the formula to solve for g:\n\ng ≥ (E - 3V + 6) / 6\n\nPlugging in the values for V and E:\n\ng ≥ (25 - 3(10) + 6) / 6\ng ≥ (25 - 30 + 6) / 6\ng ≥ 1\n\nSo, the minimum genus of the graph is 1."
