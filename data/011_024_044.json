    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initialize the flow in all edges to 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path from A to D in the residual graph. An augmenting path is a path where the residual capacity of each edge is greater than 0. The residual capacity of an edge is the original capacity minus the current flow.\n\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path by the minimum residual capacity found in the path.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm:\n\n1. Initial flow: AB = 0, AC = 0, AD = 0, BC = 0, BD = 0, CD = 0\n\n2. Find an augmenting path: A -> B -> C -> D with residual capacities 10, 8, and 6.\n\n3. Update the flow: AB = 6, AC = 0, AD = 0, BC = 6, BD = 0, CD = 6\n\n4. Find another augmenting path: A -> C -> B -> D with residual capacities 5, 2, and 1.\n\n5. Update the flow: AB = 6, AC = 2, AD = 0, BC = 4, BD = 1, CD = 6\n\n6. Find another augmenting path: A -> D with residual capacity 4.\n\n7. Update the flow: AB = 6, AC = 2, AD = 4, BC = 4, BD = 1, CD = 6\n\nNo more augmenting paths can be found. The maximum flow from A to D is the sum of the flows in the edges leaving A: 6 (AB) + 2 (AC) + 4 (AD) = 12."
