    "message_1": "A student is conducting a survey to find out the probability of students preferring tea or coffee in their university.  Out of a sample of 50 students, 30 students preferred tea and the rest preferred coffee. What is the probability that the next student surveyed will prefer coffee given that the previous 5 students surveyed preferred tea?",
    "message_2": "Since the problem does not provide any information that the preference of the next student is dependent on the previous 5 students' preferences, we can assume that the probability remains the same as the overall sample.\n\nOut of the 50 students, 30 preferred tea and the rest (50 - 30 = 20) preferred coffee. Therefore, the probability of a student preferring coffee is:\n\nP(coffee) = Number of students preferring coffee / Total number of students\nP(coffee) = 20 / 50\nP(coffee) = 2 / 5\n\nSo, the probability that the next student surveyed will prefer coffee, given that the previous 5 students surveyed preferred tea, is 2/5 or 0.4 (40%)."
