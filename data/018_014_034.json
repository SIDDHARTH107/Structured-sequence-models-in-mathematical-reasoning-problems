    "message_2": "To determine if the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over complement, we need to check if (A × B)' = A' × B' and (A' ∪ B').\n\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian product A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A × B, denoted as (A × B)':\nSince A × B contains all possible ordered pairs of elements from A and B, the complement of A × B would be the set of all ordered pairs that are not in A × B. However, without a universal set, we cannot determine the complement of A × B. Therefore, we cannot calculate (A × B)'.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot calculate A' and B' without a universal set. Thus, we cannot calculate A' × B' and (A' ∪ B').\n\nIn conclusion, without a universal set, we cannot determine if the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over complement."
