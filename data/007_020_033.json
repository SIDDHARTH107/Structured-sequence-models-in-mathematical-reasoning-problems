    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve related to RSA encryption:\n\nSuppose Alice chooses two prime numbers, p=31 and q=37, and computes their product n=pq. She also chooses an integer e=17, which is relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1). Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, she computes d=413, which is the multiplicative inverse of e modulo (p-1)(q-1). If Alice wants to encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using RSA encryption, where each letter is represented by the corresponding number (A=1, B=2, etc.), what is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using RSA encryption, we will first convert each letter to its corresponding number: H=8, E=5, L=12, L=12, O=15. Now we have the numerical message: 8, 5, 12, 12, 15.\n\nNext, we will use the public key (n, e) = (31*37, 17) = (1147, 17) to encrypt each number in the message. We will raise each number to the power of e and then take the remainder when divided by n. This can be represented as:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nwhere C is the encrypted number, M is the original number, e is the encryption exponent, and n is the product of the two prime numbers.\n\nApplying this formula to each number in the message:\n\nC1 ≡ 8^17 (mod 1147) ≡ 864\nC2 ≡ 5^17 (mod 1147) ≡ 1073\nC3 ≡ 12^17 (mod 1147) ≡ 330\nC4 ≡ 12^17 (mod 1147) ≡ 330\nC5 ≡ 15^17 (mod 1147) ≡ 991\n\nThe encrypted message is: 864, 1073, 330, 330, 991."
