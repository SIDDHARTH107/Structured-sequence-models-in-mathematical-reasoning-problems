    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation, we will use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on x and the other depending on t:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstitute this into the PDE:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -$\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4}X(x) = 0$$\n$$T''(t) + \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$$\n\nSolve the spatial ODE with boundary conditions $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$. This is a Sturm-Liouville problem with eigenvalues $\\lambda_n = 2n$ and eigenfunctions $X_n(x) = \\sin(2nx)$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$.\n\nNow solve the temporal ODE for each $\\lambda_n = 2n$:\n\n$$T_n''(t) + 4n^2 T_n(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for this ODE is:\n\n$$T_n(t) = A_n\\cos(2nt) + B_n\\sin(2nt)$$\n\nUsing the initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$0 = -2nA_n\\sin(2nt) + 2nB_n\\cos(2nt)$$\n\nAt $t = 0$, this simplifies to $0 = 2nB_n$, so $B_n = 0$. Thus, the temporal part of the solution is:\n\n$$T_n(t) = A_n\\cos(2nt)$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum of the product of spatial and temporal parts:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(2nx)\\cos(2nt)$$\n\nUsing the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(x)$, we get:\n\n$$\\sin(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(2nx)$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $\\sin(2nx)$, we find that $A_1 = 1$ and $A_n = 0$ for $n \\geq 2$. Therefore, the Fourier series solution for $u(x,t)$ is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sin(2x)\\cos(2t)$$\n\nNow, we can find the exact solution at time $t = 2$:\n\n$$u(x,2) = \\sin(2x)\\cos(4)$$"
