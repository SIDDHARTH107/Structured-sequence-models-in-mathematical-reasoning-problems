    "message_1": "A company produces two products, P1 and P2, with a profit margin of $5 and $7 per unit respectively. The production process has two stages, and the total production capacity for each stage is limited. The first stage can produce 100 units, while the second stage can produce 200 units. The production process for P1 takes 3 units of the first stage and 1 unit of the second stage, whereas the production process for P2 takes 2 units of the first stage and 2 units of the second stage. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of P1 produced and y be the number of units of P2 produced. The objective is to maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the constraints of the production capacities:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 100 (first stage constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 200 (second stage constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints in terms of y:\n\ny ≥ (100 - 3x) / 2 (first stage constraint)\ny ≤ (200 - x) / 2 (second stage constraint)\n\nNow, we'll plot these constraints along with the non-negativity constraints:\n\n1. y ≥ (100 - 3x) / 2\n2. y ≤ (200 - x) / 2\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 100), (20, 90), and (40, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 100) = 5(0) + 7(100) = $700\n3. Profit at (20, 90) = 5(20) + 7(90) = $100 + $630 = $730\n4. Profit at (40, 0) = 5(40) + 7(0) = $200\n\nThe maximum profit is $730, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of P1 and 90 units of P2."
