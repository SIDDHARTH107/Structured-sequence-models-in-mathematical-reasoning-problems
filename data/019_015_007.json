    "message_2": "Let's denote the three base types as A, B, and C. In a type theory system with the ability to form arbitrary function types, we can form function types by combining these base types in various ways. For example, A → B represents a function type from A to B.\n\nTo find the cardinality of the set of all possible types, we need to consider the number of ways we can combine these base types to form function types. Since we can form arbitrary function types, there is no limit to the depth of nesting or the number of combinations we can create. This means that the set of all possible types is infinite.\n\nHowever, we can attempt to give a more precise answer by considering the cardinality of the set of all possible types. Let's denote the set of all possible types as T. We can define T recursively as follows:\n\n1. A, B, and C are in T.\n2. If X and Y are in T, then X → Y is in T.\n\nNow, let's consider the cardinality of T. Since we can form an infinite number of function types by combining the base types and other function types, the cardinality of T is uncountably infinite. In particular, the cardinality of T is at least as large as the cardinality of the set of all finite sequences of A, B, and C, which is countably infinite (i.e., has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers). However, since we can form arbitrary function types, the cardinality of T is actually larger than this.\n\nIn conclusion, the cardinality of the set of all possible types in a type theory system with three base types and the ability to form arbitrary function types is uncountably infinite."
