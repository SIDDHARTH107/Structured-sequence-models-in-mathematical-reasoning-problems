    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}. Find the values of (A △ B) x B and A x (B △ A), where △ denotes the symmetric difference between two sets and x denotes the Cartesian product. Show that (A △ B) x B is not equal to A x (B △ A), thus proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = {1, 3} (since 1 is in A but not in B, and 3 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian products (A △ B) x B and A x (B △ A).\n\n(A △ B) x B = {1, 3} x {2, 3} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nA x (B △ A) = {1, 2} x {1, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two Cartesian products:\n\n(A △ B) x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nA x (B △ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) x B is not equal to A x (B △ A), since their sets of ordered pairs are different. This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
