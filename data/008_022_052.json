    "message_1": "Suppose we have a system of linear equations with ill-conditioned matrices:\n\nx + y + z = 3\n0.95x + y + z = 2.95\nx + 0.95y + z = 2.95\n\nFind the solution to the system of equations using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, correct to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n| 1    1    1  | 3    |\n| 0.95 1    1  | 2.95 |\n| 1    0.95 1  | 2.95 |\n\nStep 1: Find the pivot element in the first column. The pivot element is the largest element in the first column, which is 1. So, no need to swap rows.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows by subtracting a multiple of the first row from the second and third rows.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 0.95 * Row1:\n| 1    1    1  | 3    |\n| 0    0.05 0  | -0.05|\n| 1    0.95 1  | 2.95 |\n\nRow3 = Row3 - 1 * Row1:\n| 1    1    1  | 3    |\n| 0    0.05 0  | -0.05|\n| 0   -0.05 0  | -0.05|\n\nStep 3: Find the pivot element in the second column. The pivot element is the largest element in the second column, which is 0.05. So, no need to swap rows.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in the third row by subtracting a multiple of the second row from the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 - (-1) * Row2:\n| 1    1    1  | 3    |\n| 0    0.05 0  | -0.05|\n| 0    0    0  | 0    |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nSince the third row is all zeros, we can ignore it.\n\n0.05y = -0.05\ny = -0.05 / 0.05\ny = -1\n\nNow substitute y back into the first equation:\n\nx + (-1) + z = 3\nx - 1 + z = 3\nx + z = 4\n\nSince we have no more equations to determine x and z, we have infinitely many solutions. The solution can be expressed as:\n\nx = 4 - z\ny = -1\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
