    "message_1": "What is the F-ratio for an ANOVA that compares the means of four groups with the following data: Group 1 has a sample size of 10 and an average of 25, Group 2 has a sample size of 12 and an average of 22, Group 3 has a sample size of 15 and an average of 27, and Group 4 has a sample size of 13 and an average of 24? The total sum of squares is 700 and the within-group sum of squares is 400.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the F-ratio for an ANOVA, we first need to find the between-group sum of squares and then calculate the mean squares for both between-group and within-group. Finally, we will divide the between-group mean square by the within-group mean square to get the F-ratio.\n\n1. Calculate the between-group sum of squares:\nTotal sum of squares = Between-group sum of squares + Within-group sum of squares\n700 = Between-group sum of squares + 400\nBetween-group sum of squares = 700 - 400 = 300\n\n2. Calculate the degrees of freedom for between-group (df_between) and within-group (df_within):\ndf_between = number of groups - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\ndf_within = total sample size - number of groups = (10 + 12 + 15 + 13) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46\n\n3. Calculate the mean squares for between-group (MS_between) and within-group (MS_within):\nMS_between = Between-group sum of squares / df_between = 300 / 3 = 100\nMS_within = Within-group sum of squares / df_within = 400 / 46 ≈ 8.70\n\n4. Calculate the F-ratio:\nF-ratio = MS_between / MS_within = 100 / 8.70 ≈ 11.49\n\nThe F-ratio for this ANOVA is approximately 11.49."
