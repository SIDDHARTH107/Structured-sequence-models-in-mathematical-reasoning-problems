    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the given graph, we can use the following observations:\n\n1. If the graph has a cycle of length 3, then it has a triangle. In this case, the girth is 3.\n2. If the graph has no triangles, then the minimum cycle length is 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of edges a graph with 10 vertices can have without having a triangle. This can be achieved by constructing a bipartite graph, where the vertices are divided into two sets, and all edges go between the sets.\n\nLet's divide the 10 vertices into two sets: one with 5 vertices and the other with 5 vertices. The maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with these two sets is 5 * 5 = 25. However, we only have 15 edges in our graph.\n\nSince 15 is less than the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with 10 vertices, it is possible to construct a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges without having a triangle. In this case, the girth of the graph would be 4.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the given graph is 4."
