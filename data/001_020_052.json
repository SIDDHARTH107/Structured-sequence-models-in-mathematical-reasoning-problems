    "message_2": "For a point to lie on the x-axis, its y-coordinate must be 0. So, we need to find the x-coordinates for which y = |2x - 3| equals 0.\n\n0 = |2x - 3|\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 3 = 0\n2x = 3\nx = 3/2\n\nCase 2: 2x - 3 = -0 (since the absolute value of a negative number is positive)\n2x - 3 = 0\n2x = 3\nx = 3/2\n\nIn both cases, we get the same x-coordinate, x = 3/2. Therefore, the graph of the equation y = |2x - 3| intersects the x-axis at the point with x-coordinate 3/2."
