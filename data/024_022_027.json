    "message_1": "Let's take the metric given by $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$ on the plane. Find all isometries that preserve this metric and map the point $(1,0)$ to $(-3,4)$.",
    "message_2": "An isometry on the plane is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points. In the context of the given metric, isometries can be translations, rotations, and reflections. We are looking for isometries that map the point (1, 0) to (-3, 4).\n\nLet's consider the following cases:\n\n1. Translation:\nA translation is given by $(x, y) \\mapsto (x + a, y + b)$. Since we want to map (1, 0) to (-3, 4), we have:\n(1 + a, 0 + b) = (-3, 4)\nSolving for a and b, we get a = -4 and b = 4. So, the translation isometry is given by $(x, y) \\mapsto (x - 4, y + 4)$.\n\n2. Rotation:\nA rotation is given by $(x, y) \\mapsto (x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta, x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta)$. We want to find the angle $\\theta$ such that (1, 0) is mapped to (-3, 4). Plugging in the points, we get:\n(1 * cos(θ) - 0 * sin(θ), 1 * sin(θ) + 0 * cos(θ)) = (-3, 4)\nThis simplifies to:\n(cos(θ), sin(θ)) = (-3, 4)\n\nHowever, this is not possible since the square of cosine and sine of any angle cannot sum up to more than 1 (i.e., cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ) = 1). Therefore, there is no rotation isometry that maps (1, 0) to (-3, 4).\n\n3. Reflection:\nA reflection is given by $(x, y) \\mapsto (x \\cos 2\\alpha - y \\sin 2\\alpha, x \\sin 2\\alpha + y \\cos 2\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is the angle between the reflection line and the x-axis. We want to find the angle $\\alpha$ such that (1, 0) is mapped to (-3, 4). Plugging in the points, we get:\n(1 * cos(2α) - 0 * sin(2α), 1 * sin(2α) + 0 * cos(2α)) = (-3, 4)\nThis simplifies to:\n(cos(2α), sin(2α)) = (-3, 4)\n\nAgain, this is not possible since the square of cosine and sine of any angle cannot sum up to more than 1. Therefore, there is no reflection isometry that maps (1, 0) to (-3, 4).\n\nIn conclusion, the only isometry that maps the point (1, 0) to (-3, 4) and preserves the given metric is the translation isometry $(x, y) \\mapsto (x - 4, y + 4)$."
