    "message_2": "To find the impulse response of the network, we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of the transfer function H(jw). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nh(t) = (1/2π) ∫ H(jw) * e^(jwt) dw (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nwhere h(t) is the impulse response, and t is the time variable.\n\nWe have H(jw) = (jw + 1) / (jw + 5). Let's perform the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nh(t) = (1/2π) ∫ [(jw + 1) / (jw + 5)] * e^(jwt) dw (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the residue theorem from complex analysis. First, we need to find the poles of the integrand. The poles are the values of w for which the denominator becomes zero:\n\njw + 5 = 0\nw = -5j\n\nNow, we need to find the residue at this pole. The residue is given by:\n\nResidue = lim(w -> -5j) [(w + 5j) * (jw + 1) / (jw + 5)]\n\n= lim(w -> -5j) [(jw + 1)]\n\n= j(-5j) + 1\n\n= 25 - j5\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nh(t) = (1/2π) * 2π * Residue * e^(-5jt)\n\nh(t) = (25 - j5) * e^(-5jt)\n\nSo, the impulse response of the network is:\n\nh(t) = (25 - j5) * e^(-5jt)"
