    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole at z = 2, we need to determine the highest power of (z - 2) in the denominator that can be canceled out by the numerator. In this case, the denominator has a (z - 2)^3 term.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the function f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = [(z - 1)(z - 3)] / (z - 2)^3\n\nWe can see that the numerator cannot cancel out any (z - 2) terms from the denominator, as it does not have any (z - 2) factors.\n\nTherefore, the order of the pole at z = 2 is 3, as there are three (z - 2) factors in the denominator that cannot be canceled out by the numerator.\n\nThe type of the pole is called a \"simple pole\" if the order is 1, and a \"higher-order pole\" if the order is greater than 1. In this case, since the order of the pole is 3, it is a higher-order pole."
