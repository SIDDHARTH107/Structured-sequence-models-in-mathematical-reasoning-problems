    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 vertices, so a connected graph must have at least 10-1 = 9 edges. Since our graph G has 14 edges, which is more than the minimum required, it is possible for G to be connected.\n\nHowever, having more than the minimum number of edges does not guarantee that the graph is connected. To be sure, we would need more information about the specific connections between the vertices. Without that information, we cannot definitively say whether G is connected or not."
