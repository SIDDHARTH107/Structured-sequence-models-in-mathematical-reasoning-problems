    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve, and its construction is based on a recursive process. The standard construction method for a Hilbert curve involves starting with a first-order curve and then iteratively replacing each segment with a scaled-down version of the curve from the previous order.\n\nFor a first-order Hilbert curve, there are 3 turns.\n\nTo construct a second-order Hilbert curve, we replace each segment of the first-order curve with a scaled-down version of the first-order curve itself. Since there are 4 segments in the first-order curve and each segment has 3 turns, the second-order curve will have 4 * 3 = 12 turns.\n\nTo construct a third-order Hilbert curve, we replace each segment of the second-order curve with a scaled-down version of the second-order curve. Since there are 4 segments in the second-order curve and each segment has 12 turns, the third-order curve will have 4 * 12 = 48 turns.\n\nSo, the number of turns required to construct a third-order Hilbert curve using the standard construction method is 48."
