    "message_2": "A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn a planar graph, the number of faces (F) can be related to the number of edges (E) and vertices (V) using the inequality:\n\n3F ≤ 2E\n\nCombining Euler's formula and the inequality, we get:\n\nV - E + F ≥ V - E + (2E/3) = 2\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, V = 10, so:\n\nE ≤ 3(10) - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24\n\nTherefore, a planar graph with 10 vertices can have at most 24 edges."
