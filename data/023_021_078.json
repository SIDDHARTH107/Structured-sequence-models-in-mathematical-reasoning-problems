    "message_1": "A plane electromagnetic wave with a frequency of 10 GHz is traveling in free space along the z-axis. The electric field has an amplitude of 5 V/m and is polarized in the y-direction. Use the Fourier transform to find the corresponding magnetic field amplitude in Tesla. Assume the wave is monochromatic and has no attenuation. What is its wavelength in meters? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. The speed of light in free space (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. The frequency (f) is given as 10 GHz, which is 10 x 10^9 Hz. We can use the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength:\n\nc = 位f\n\nWhere 位 is the wavelength. Solving for 位:\n\n位 = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (10 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.03 m\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field amplitude. The relationship between the electric field (E) and magnetic field (B) amplitudes in an electromagnetic wave is given by:\n\nE = cB\n\nWe are given the electric field amplitude (E) as 5 V/m. Solving for the magnetic field amplitude (B):\n\nB = E / c = (5 V/m) / (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 1.67 x 10^-8 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field amplitude is approximately 1.67 x 10^-8 T, and the wavelength is 0.03 m (rounded to two decimal places)."
