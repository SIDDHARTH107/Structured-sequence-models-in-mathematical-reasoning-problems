    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's rewrite the constraints in the standard form:\n\ng1(x) = x1 + 2x2 - 3 ≤ 0\ng2(x) = x1 - x2 - 2 ≤ 0\ng3(x) = -x1 ≤ 0\ng4(x) = -x2 ≤ 0\n\nNow, we define the Lagrangian function L(x, λ) = f(x) + λ1g1(x) + λ2g2(x) + λ3g3(x) + λ4g4(x), where λ = (λ1, λ2, λ3, λ4) are the Lagrange multipliers.\n\nL(x, λ) = 2x1^2 + 3x2^2 - 4x1x2 + 2x1 - x2 + λ1(x1 + 2x2 - 3) + λ2(x1 - x2 - 2) - λ3x1 - λ4x2\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L with respect to x and λ and set them equal to zero:\n\n∇xL = (dL/dx1, dL/dx2) = (4x1 - 4x2 + 2 + λ1 + λ2 - λ3, 6x2 - 4x1 - 1 + 2λ1 - λ2 - λ4) = 0\n∇λL = (g1, g2, g3, g4) = 0\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 4x1 - 4x2 + 2 + λ1 + λ2 - λ3 = 0\n2) 6x2 - 4x1 - 1 + 2λ1 - λ2 - λ4 = 0\n3) x1 + 2x2 - 3 = 0 (complementary slackness: λ1g1(x) = 0)\n4) x1 - x2 - 2 = 0 (complementary slackness: λ2g2(x) = 0)\n5) -x1 = 0 (complementary slackness: λ3g3(x) = 0)\n6) -x2 = 0 (complementary slackness: λ4g4(x) = 0)\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that x1 = 1 and x2 = 1. Plugging these values back into the constraints, we see that they satisfy all the constraints:\n\nx1 + 2x2 = 1 + 2(1) = 3\nx1 - x2 = 1 - 1 = 0 ≤ 2\nx1, x2 ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of f(x) by plugging in the values of x1 and x2:\n\nf(x) = 2(1)^2 + 3(1)^2 - 4(1)(1) + 2(1) - 1 = 2 + 3 - 4 + 2 - 1 = 2\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) is 2, and the values of x1 and x2 at that minimum point are both 1."
