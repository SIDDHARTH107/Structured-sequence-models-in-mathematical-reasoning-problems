    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the curve, we need to find the points where both the partial derivatives with respect to x and y are zero. Let's compute these partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both of these partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n\nWe can simplify these equations by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. Let's solve this system.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where x = 0. From the first equation, we get:\n\n0^2 - y(0) = 0\n0 = 0\n\nThis equation is always true, so we don't get any information about y. Now, let's look at the second equation:\n\ny^2 - 0(0) = 0\ny^2 = 0\n\nThis implies that y = 0. So, one singular point is (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's consider the case where y = 0. From the first equation, we get:\n\nx^2 - 0(0) = 0\nx^2 = 0\n\nThis implies that x = 0. So, we already found this singular point (0, 0).\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0. We can divide the second equation by the first equation:\n\n(y^2 - xz) / (x^2 - yz) = 1\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\ny^2(x^2 - yz) = x^2(y^2 - xz)\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\nx^2y^2 - y^3z = x^2y^2 - x^3z\n\nNow, we can cancel out the x^2y^2 terms:\n\ny^3z = x^3z\n\nSince x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by xy:\n\ny^2 = x^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\ny = x or y = -x\n\nNow, let's substitute these solutions back into the original equation:\n\nFor y = x:\n\nx^3 + x^3 = 3x^2x\n2x^3 = 3x^3\n\nThis implies that x = 0, but we already found the singular point (0, 0) for this case.\n\nFor y = -x:\n\nx^3 - x^3 = 3x(-x^2)\n0 = -3x^3\n\nThis implies that x = 0, but we already found the singular point (0, 0) for this case.\n\nSo, the only singular point on the curve x^3 + y^3 = 3xyz is (0, 0)."
