    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using Gaussian elimination, we first need to write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n|  3   2  -1 |  1  |\n|  2  -2   4 | -2  |\n| -1  1/2 -1 |  0  |\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the first row by 2/3 and subtract it from the second row. Then, we can multiply the first row by 1/3 and add it to the third row.\n\n```\n|  3    2   -1 |  1  |\n|  0   -4  8/3 | -4/3|\n|  0    3/2 -2 |  1/3|\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the second row by -3/8 and add it to the third row.\n\n```\n|  3    2   -1 |  1  |\n|  0   -4  8/3 | -4/3|\n|  0    0  -1/3|  1/3|\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have -1/3 * z = 1/3, so z = -1.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nFrom the second row, we have -4y + 8/3 * z = -4/3. Substituting z = -1, we get -4y - 8/3 = -4/3, so y = 1.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFrom the first row, we have 3x + 2y - z = 1. Substituting y = 1 and z = -1, we get 3x + 2 - 1 = 1, so x = 0.\n\nThe solution to the system of equations is x = 0, y = 1, and z = -1."
