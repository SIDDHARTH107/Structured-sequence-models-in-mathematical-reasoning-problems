    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference between A and B, and then find the symmetric difference between the complement of A and the complement of B. Show that the two symmetric differences are not equal, thus proving that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In this case, the symmetric difference between A and B is:\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A and the complement of B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the given set. Since we are not given a universal set, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nThe complement of A is:\n\nA' = U - A = {4}\n\nThe complement of B is:\n\nB' = U - B = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between the complement of A and the complement of B:\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nComparing the two symmetric differences, we can see that they are equal:\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nHowever, this does not prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over complement in general. This is just a specific example where the symmetric differences happen to be equal. In general, the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
