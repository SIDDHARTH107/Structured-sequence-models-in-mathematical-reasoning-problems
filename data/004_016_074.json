    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet f(t) represent the position of the car at time t, where t is measured in hours and f(t) is measured in miles. We are given that the car travels 150 miles in 3 hours, so we have:\n\nf(0) = 0 (assuming the car starts at mile 0)\nf(3) = 150\n\nThe function f(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 3] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 3), since the position of the car is a continuous and differentiable function of time.\n\nNow, we find the average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 3]:\n\n( f(3) - f(0) ) / (3 - 0) = (150 - 0) / 3 = 50 miles per hour\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 3) such that the derivative of the position function at c is equal to the average rate of change:\n\nf'(c) = 50\n\nSince f'(t) represents the velocity of the car at time t, this means that at some point during the trip (at time c), the car was traveling exactly 50 miles per hour."
