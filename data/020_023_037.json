    "message_1": "Suppose an investor has $100,000 to invest in two different assets: stocks and bonds. The stocks yield a return of 10% annually, while bonds yield a return of 5% annually. However, the investor's risk tolerance for stocks is not greater than 50% of their total investment. How much should the investor allocate to each asset to maximize their overall return?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the overall return, the investor should allocate as much as possible to stocks without exceeding their risk tolerance. Since their risk tolerance for stocks is 50% of their total investment, they should allocate 50% of $100,000 to stocks and the remaining 50% to bonds.\n\nSo, the investor should allocate:\n\nStocks: 0.5 * $100,000 = $50,000\nBonds: 0.5 * $100,000 = $50,000\n\nWith this allocation, the investor will earn:\n\nStocks return: $50,000 * 0.10 = $5,000\nBonds return: $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500\n\nThe total return will be $5,000 + $2,500 = $7,500 per year."
