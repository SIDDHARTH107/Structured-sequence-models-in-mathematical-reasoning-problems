    "message_2": "Differential Evolution (DE) is a population-based optimization algorithm that works by iteratively improving candidate solutions with regard to a given measure of quality. Here, we will use DE to minimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 over the range -10 ≤ x ≤ 10. \n\nStep 1: Initialize the population\nChoose a population size, say N = 10, and randomly generate N individuals within the given range. Let's denote these individuals as x1, x2, ..., x10.\n\nStep 2: Set parameters\nChoose values for the scaling factor F and crossover probability CR. Common choices are F = 0.8 and CR = 0.9.\n\nStep 3: Perform the DE loop\nRepeat the following steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations, minimum function value, or minimum change in function value):\n\n1. For each individual xi in the population, do the following:\n   a. Randomly select three distinct individuals from the population, say xr1, xr2, and xr3, where r1, r2, and r3 are distinct and different from i.\n   b. Compute the mutant vector vi = xr1 + F * (xr2 - xr3).\n   c. Perform crossover between xi and vi to generate a trial vector ui. For each component j of the vectors, set uj = vj if rand(0, 1) < CR, otherwise set uj = xij, where rand(0, 1) generates a random number between 0 and 1.\n   d. Evaluate the function values f(xi) and f(ui). If f(ui) < f(xi), replace xi with ui in the population.\n\n2. Update the best solution found so far.\n\nStep 4: Return the best solution\nReturn the individual with the lowest function value in the final population as the optimal value of x.\n\nNote that DE is a stochastic algorithm, and the results may vary between different runs. To increase the confidence in the solution, you can perform multiple runs and choose the best solution among them.\n\nIn this specific problem, it's worth noting that the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 is a quadratic function with a unique minimum value. You can find the exact solution by setting the derivative equal to zero and solving for x:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4 = 0\nx = 2\n\nSo the optimal value of x that minimizes the function f(x) is x = 2. However, the DE algorithm can still be used to approximate this solution when the exact solution is not easily obtainable."
