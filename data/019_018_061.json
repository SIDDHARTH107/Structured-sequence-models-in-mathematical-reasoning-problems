    "message_2": "Let's consider two odd numbers, represented by the variables a and b. By definition, an odd number can be expressed as 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, let a = 2n1 + 1 and b = 2n2 + 1, where n1 and n2 are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of these two odd numbers:\n\na + b = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1)\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\na + b = 2n1 + 2n2 + 1 + 1\n\nFactor out the 2:\n\na + b = 2(n1 + n2) + 2\n\nNow, let's represent the sum (n1 + n2) as another integer, say m:\n\na + b = 2m + 2, where m = n1 + n2\n\nSince m is an integer (as it is the sum of two integers), we can see that the sum of two odd numbers (a + b) can be expressed in the form of 2m + 2, which is a multiple of 2.\n\nThus, the sum of two odd numbers is always even.
