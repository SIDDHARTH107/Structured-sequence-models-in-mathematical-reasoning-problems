    "message_2": "We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. For a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 6$, and $c = 13$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$z = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(13)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$z = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 52}}{2}$\n\n$z = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{-16}}{2}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we know that the solutions will be complex numbers. We can rewrite the square root of a negative number as the product of the square root of the positive counterpart and the imaginary unit $i$:\n\n$z = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{16}i}{2}$\n\n$z = \\frac{-6 \\pm 4i}{2}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by dividing both the real and imaginary parts by 2:\n\n$z = -3 \\pm 2i$\n\nSo, the complex numbers $z$ that satisfy the given equation are $z = -3 + 2i$ and $z = -3 - 2i$."
