    "message_1": "A manufacturer has two machines (Machine A and Machine B) that can produce a certain product. The profit per unit from Machine A is $8 and from Machine B is $6. \n\nHowever, Machine A can produce a maximum of 300 units per day, while Machine B can only produce a maximum of 200 units per day. The manufacturer wants to produce at least 1200 units in total per day to meet demand. \n\nUsing quadratic programming, what is the optimal combination of units from each machine to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units produced by Machine A and y be the number of units produced by Machine B. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 8x + 6y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≥ 1200 (at least 1200 units in total per day)\n2. x ≤ 300 (Machine A can produce a maximum of 300 units per day)\n3. y ≤ 200 (Machine B can produce a maximum of 200 units per day)\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as inequalities:\n\n1. y ≥ 1200 - x\n2. x ≤ 300\n3. y ≤ 200\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints. The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraint lines intersect. We'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nVertices of the feasible region:\nA. (0, 1200) - Not feasible, as it exceeds Machine B's capacity\nB. (300, 900) - Not feasible, as it exceeds Machine B's capacity\nC. (300, 200) - Feasible\nD. (1000, 0) - Not feasible, as it exceeds Machine A's capacity\nE. (300, 0) - Feasible\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at the feasible vertices:\n\nP(300, 200) = 8(300) + 6(200) = 2400 + 1200 = 3600\nP(300, 0) = 8(300) + 6(0) = 2400\n\nThe maximum profit is $3600 when producing 300 units with Machine A and 200 units with Machine B."
