    "message_2": "First, we need to rewrite the given equation as a function of z in terms of x and y:\n\nz^2 - 4z + x^2 + y^2 = 0\nz^2 - 4z + 4 = x^2 + y^2\n(z - 2)^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nNow, we have the equation of a paraboloid with vertex at (0, 0, 2). To find the scalar curvature, we need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, 2 + sqrt(u^2 + v^2))\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, u/sqrt(u^2 + v^2))\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, v/sqrt(u^2 + v^2))\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, v^2/(u^2 + v^2)^(3/2))\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, -uv/(u^2 + v^2)^(3/2))\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, u^2/(u^2 + v^2)^(3/2))\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + (u^2/(u^2 + v^2))\nF = r_u • r_v = uv/(u^2 + v^2)\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + (v^2/(u^2 + v^2))\n\nL = r_uu • N = -v^2/(u^2 + v^2)^(3/2)\nM = r_uv • N = uv/(u^2 + v^2)^(3/2)\nN = r_vv • N = -u^2/(u^2 + v^2)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\nH = (1/2) * (EN + GL - 2FM) / (EG - F^2)\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar curvature R:\n\nR = 2K = 2 * (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (0, 0, 0), the parameterization is not well-defined. However, we can take the limit as (u, v) approaches (0, 0):\n\nlim (u, v) -> (0, 0) R = 2 * (0 - 0) / (1 - 0) = 0\n\nSo, the scalar curvature at the point (0, 0, 0) is 0."
