    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B and also the Cartesian product of B and A, then find the union of the two products. Show that the union of the two products is not equal to each other, i.e., demonstrate that the Cartesian product is not commutative with respect to union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A. The Cartesian product of two sets B and A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, B × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}.\n\nNext, let's find the union of the two products, denoted as (A × B) ∪ (B × A). The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set. So, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}.\n\nNow, let's demonstrate that the Cartesian product is not commutative with respect to union. To do this, we need to show that (A × B) ∪ (B × A) is not equal to either A × B or B × A.\n\nComparing (A × B) ∪ (B × A) with A × B, we can see that there are elements in (A × B) ∪ (B × A) that are not in A × B, such as (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Therefore, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) is not equal to A × B.\n\nSimilarly, comparing (A × B) ∪ (B × A) with B × A, we can see that there are elements in (A × B) ∪ (B × A) that are not in B × A, such as (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), and (2, 4). Therefore, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) is not equal to B × A.\n\nSince (A × B) ∪ (B × A) is not equal to either A × B or B × A, we have demonstrated that the Cartesian product is not commutative with respect to union."
