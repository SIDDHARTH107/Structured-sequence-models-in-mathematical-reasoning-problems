    "message_1": "A company has 10 employees, and each employee will be given a different task to complete. In how many ways can the company assign the tasks if 4 employees are only capable of completing task A, 3 employees are only capable of completing task B, and the remaining 3 employees are capable of completing any task?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Assign task A: There are 4 employees who can only complete task A, so there is only 1 way to assign task A to one of these employees.\n\n2. Assign task B: There are 3 employees who can only complete task B, so there is only 1 way to assign task B to one of these employees.\n\n3. Assign the remaining tasks to the 3 employees who can complete any task: There are 8 tasks left (10 tasks in total - task A - task B) and 3 employees who can complete any task. We can use the formula for permutations to calculate the number of ways to assign the remaining tasks:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!\n\nwhere n is the number of tasks and r is the number of employees.\n\nIn this case, n = 8 and r = 3, so:\n\nP(8, 3) = 8! / (8-3)!\n          = 8! / 5!\n          = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n          = (8 × 7 × 6)\n          = 336\n\nSo there are 336 ways to assign the remaining tasks to the 3 employees who can complete any task.\n\nSince there is only 1 way to assign task A and task B, the total number of ways to assign the tasks is:\n\n1 (task A) × 1 (task B) × 336 (remaining tasks) = 336 ways."
