    "message_1": "In a group of 10 people, how many ways can they be seated on a circular table if 3 of them refuse to sit next to each other? (Hint: use Polya's enumeration theorem to solve this problem)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the total number of ways to seat the 10 people without any restrictions and then subtract the number of ways in which the 3 people sit next to each other.\n\n1. Total number of ways to seat 10 people in a circle:\nSince there is no starting point in a circle, we consider (n-1)! ways to arrange n people in a circle. So for 10 people, there are 9! ways to arrange them. \n\n2. Number of ways in which the 3 people sit next to each other:\nTreat the 3 people who refuse to sit next to each other as a single entity. Now we have 8 entities (7 individuals + 1 group of 3 people) to arrange in a circle. There are (8-1)! = 7! ways to arrange these entities in a circle. \n\nHowever, within the group of 3 people, they can be arranged in 3! ways. So, the total number of ways in which the 3 people sit next to each other is 7! * 3!.\n\n3. Number of ways to seat 10 people with the restriction:\nNow, we subtract the number of ways in which the 3 people sit next to each other from the total number of ways to seat 10 people without any restrictions.\n\nTotal ways = 9! - (7! * 3!)\n\nTotal ways = 362880 - (5040 * 6)\n\nTotal ways = 362880 - 30240\n\nTotal ways = 332640\n\nSo, there are 332,640 ways to seat the 10 people on a circular table with the given restriction."
