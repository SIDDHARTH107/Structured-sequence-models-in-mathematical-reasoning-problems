    "message_1": "Suppose we want to use a Feistel cipher structure to encrypt a 64-bit message. If we use 16 rounds to encrypt the message, and we want each subkey to be 48 bits long, how many total bits are needed for the encryption key?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, a subkey is used in each round of the encryption process. If there are 16 rounds and each subkey is 48 bits long, then the total number of bits needed for the encryption key can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal bits = (Number of rounds) × (Bits per subkey)\nTotal bits = 16 × 48\nTotal bits = 768\n\nSo, 768 bits are needed for the encryption key."
