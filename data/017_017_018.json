    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30, we can use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible Sylow subgroups.\n\nThe prime factorization of 30 is 2 * 3 * 5. So, we have three Sylow subgroups: Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 15 (30/2) and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 15. If n_2 = 1, then there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 10 (30/3) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 10. If n_3 = 1, then there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 6 (30/5) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possible value for n_5 is 1, so there is a normal Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of these Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, we have normal subgroups of orders 2, 3, and 5. Since these orders are pairwise coprime, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups: Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_30.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, we have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup (N_3) and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup (N_5). The group is a semi-direct product of N_3 and N_5. Since there is only one possible action of Z_2 on Z_3 x Z_5 (the trivial action), the group is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_5 x Z_2, which is isomorphic to Z_6 x Z_5.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, we have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup (N_2) and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup (N_5). The group is a semi-direct product of N_2 and N_5. Since there is only one possible action of Z_3 on Z_2 x Z_5 (the trivial action), the group is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_30. This case is the same as Case 1.\n\nThere are no other possible combinations of Sylow subgroups, so we have found two distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30: Z_30 and Z_6 x Z_5."
