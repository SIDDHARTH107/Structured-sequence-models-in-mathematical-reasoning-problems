    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nFor a given number n, if n is a product of distinct prime factors, then Euler's totient function can be calculated using the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn this case, n = 27. The prime factorization of 27 is 3^3, so there is only one distinct prime factor, which is 3.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula:\n\nφ(27) = 27 * (1 - 1/3) = 27 * (2/3) = 18\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for n = 27 is 18."
