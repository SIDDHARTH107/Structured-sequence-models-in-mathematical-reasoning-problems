    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly replacing a line segment with a sequence of smaller segments. After each iteration, the total length of the curve increases by a factor of 3/2.\n\nTo find the total length of the curve after the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (3/2)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 6 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (3/2)^6\nLength = 1 * (729/64)\nLength = 729/64\n\nSo, the total length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the 6th iteration is 729/64 units, or approximately 11.390625 units."
