The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\n1. For the term 4x³:\n   Using the power rule, the derivative is (3)(4)x^(3-1) = 12x².\n\n2. For the term -5x²:\n   Using the power rule, the derivative is (2)(-5)x^(2-1) = -10x.\n\n3. For the term 7x:\n   Using the power rule, the derivative is (1)(7)x^(1-1) = 7.\n\n4. For the constant term -9:\n   The derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x² - 10x + 7"
