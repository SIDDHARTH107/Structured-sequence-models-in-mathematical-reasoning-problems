Suppose that at time t=0, X=2. Find the probability that X is greater than 3 at time t=1, given that a=1 and b=2.",
    "message_2": "This is a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form dX = aX dt + bX dW, which represents a geometric Brownian motion. To solve this SDE, we can use the Ito's lemma.\n\nLet Y = ln(X). Then, by Ito's lemma, we have:\n\ndY = (1/a * dX/X - 1/2 * b^2 * dt)\n\nNow, substituting the given values of a and b:\n\ndY = (1 * dX/X - 1/2 * 2^2 * dt) = (dX/X - 2 dt)\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to t from 0 to 1:\n\n∫(dY) = ∫(dX/X - 2 dt) from 0 to 1\n\nY(1) - Y(0) = ∫(dX/X) - 2∫dt from 0 to 1\n\nY(1) - ln(2) = ∫(dX/X) - 2t | from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that X > 3 at time t = 1. In terms of Y, this is equivalent to finding the probability that Y(1) > ln(3). Let Z = Y(1) - ln(2), then we want to find P(Z > ln(3) - ln(2)).\n\nSince Z is normally distributed (due to the properties of geometric Brownian motion), we can find its mean and variance to calculate the probability.\n\nMean of Z, E[Z] = E[Y(1) - ln(2)] = E[Y(1)] - ln(2) = (a - b^2/2) * 1 = (1 - 2^2/2) = -1\n\nVariance of Z, Var[Z] = Var[Y(1) - ln(2)] = Var[Y(1)] = b^2 * 1 = 2^2 = 4\n\nStandard deviation of Z, σ = √Var[Z] = √4 = 2\n\nNow, we standardize Z to a standard normal variable:\n\nP(Z > ln(3) - ln(2)) = P((Z - E[Z])/σ > (ln(3) - ln(2) + 1)/2)\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability:\n\nP((Z - E[Z])/σ > (ln(3) - ln(2) + 1)/2) ≈ P(Z > 0.049) ≈ 1 - Φ(0.049) ≈ 1 - 0.519 = 0.481\n\nSo, the probability that X is greater than 3 at time t = 1 is approximately 0.481."
