    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of V with respect to W, we need to compute the Lie bracket [W, V]. The Lie bracket of two vector fields is given by the commutator of their actions on functions, i.e., [W, V](f) = W(V(f)) - V(W(f)) for any smooth function f.\n\nLet's compute the action of V and W on an arbitrary smooth function f(x, y):\n\nV(f) = (2x + y)∂f/∂x + (x + y)∂f/∂y\nW(f) = (3x + 2y)∂f/∂x + (x + y)∂f/∂y\n\nNow, let's compute the action of W on V(f) and V on W(f):\n\nW(V(f)) = (3x + 2y)∂/∂x((2x + y)∂f/∂x + (x + y)∂f/∂y) + (x + y)∂/∂y((2x + y)∂f/∂x + (x + y)∂f/∂y)\n\nV(W(f)) = (2x + y)∂/∂x((3x + 2y)∂f/∂x + (x + y)∂f/∂y) + (x + y)∂/∂y((3x + 2y)∂f/∂x + (x + y)∂f/∂y)\n\nNow, we compute the Lie bracket [W, V](f) = W(V(f)) - V(W(f)):\n\n[W, V](f) = W(V(f)) - V(W(f))\n\nExpanding the derivatives and simplifying, we get:\n\n[W, V](f) = (y∂²f/∂x² + 2∂²f/∂x∂y)∂/∂x + (x∂²f/∂y² + 2∂²f/∂x∂y)∂/∂y\n\nNow, we evaluate the Lie derivative at the point (1, 2):\n\n[W, V](f) |_p = (2∂²f/∂x² + 4∂²f/∂x∂y)∂/∂x + (∂²f/∂y² + 4∂²f/∂x∂y)∂/∂y\n\nThus, the Lie derivative of V with respect to W at the point (1, 2) is given by:\n\nL_W(V) = (2∂²f/∂x² + 4∂²f/∂x∂y)∂/∂x + (∂²f/∂y² + 4∂²f/∂x∂y)∂/∂y"
