    "message_2": "To determine the area of the triangle, we first need to find the height of the triangle. We can use the sine function to do this.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60°, and the base of the triangle (adjacent side) is 8 cm. We want to find the opposite side (height) of the triangle.\n\nsin(60°) = height / hypotenuse\n\nWe can use the cosine function to find the hypotenuse.\n\ncos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\ncos(60°) = 8 cm / hypotenuse\n\nNow, we can solve for the hypotenuse:\n\nhypotenuse = 8 cm / cos(60°)\nhypotenuse ≈ 8 cm / 0.5\nhypotenuse ≈ 16 cm\n\nNow that we have the hypotenuse, we can find the height using the sine function:\n\nsin(60°) = height / 16 cm\n\nheight ≈ 16 cm * sin(60°)\nheight ≈ 16 cm * (√3/2)\nheight ≈ 8√3 cm\n\nNow that we have the base and height of the triangle, we can find the area:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 8 cm * 8√3 cm\nArea = 4 * 8√3 cm²\nArea = 32√3 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 32√3 cm²."
