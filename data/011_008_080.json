    "message_1": "In how many different ways can we arrange 6 books on a shelf if we want to group them into 2 stacks, one with 3 books and the other with 3 books? (Assuming the books can be arranged in any order on each stack)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into two steps: first, we need to choose which 3 books will go in the first stack, and then we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the books in each stack.\n\n1. Choosing 3 books for the first stack:\nThere are 6 books in total, and we want to choose 3 of them for the first stack. This is a combination problem, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 6 books), k is the number of items we want to choose (3 books), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n= 6! / (3!3!)\n= (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n= (6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n= 20\n\nSo, there are 20 different ways to choose 3 books for the first stack.\n\n2. Arranging the books in each stack:\nSince there are 3 books in each stack, there are 3! ways to arrange the books in each stack.\n\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ways to arrange the books in the first stack and 6 ways to arrange the books in the second stack.\n\n3. Total number of arrangements:\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to choose the books for the first stack (20) by the number of ways to arrange the books in each stack (6 × 6).\n\nTotal arrangements = 20 × 6 × 6 = 720\n\nSo, there are 720 different ways to arrange the 6 books into 2 stacks of 3 books each."
