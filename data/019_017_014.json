    "message_1": "Let A be a set of integers such that A contains exactly two integers between 1 and 10, inclusive, and exactly two integers between 11 and 20, inclusive. Let B be another set of integers such that B contains two integers between 1 and 20, inclusive, but none of them are in A. Prove that there exists a prime number that can be written as the sum of an element in A and an element in B.",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the possible cases for the elements in set A and set B.\n\nCase 1: A contains two odd numbers between 1 and 10, and two even numbers between 11 and 20.\nIn this case, all the elements in A are odd, and all the elements in B are even. The sum of an odd number and an even number is always odd. Since 2 is the only even prime number and it cannot be written as the sum of an odd number and an even number, we can conclude that there must be a prime number that can be written as the sum of an element in A and an element in B.\n\nCase 2: A contains one odd and one even number between 1 and 10, and one odd and one even number between 11 and 20.\nIn this case, A contains two odd numbers and two even numbers. B will contain one odd number and one even number. The sum of an odd number and an even number is always odd. Since there are two odd numbers in A and one odd number in B, there are two possible sums of an element in A and an element in B that are odd. At least one of these sums must be a prime number, as there are infinitely many prime numbers and a finite number of sums.\n\nCase 3: A contains two even numbers between 1 and 10, and two odd numbers between 11 and 20.\nThis case is symmetric to Case 1, and the same argument applies. There must be a prime number that can be written as the sum of an element in A and an element in B.\n\nIn all possible cases, there exists a prime number that can be written as the sum of an element in A and an element in B."
