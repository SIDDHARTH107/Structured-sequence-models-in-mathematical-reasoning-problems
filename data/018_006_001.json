    "message_1": "Let U be a universal set with a cardinality of 50, and let A be a subset of U with a cardinality of 20. Find the cardinality of the complement of A and show that the union of A and its complement is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "To find the cardinality of the complement of A, we need to find the number of elements in U that are not in A. Since U has a cardinality of 50 and A has a cardinality of 20, the complement of A, denoted as A', will have a cardinality of 50 - 20.\n\nCardinality of A' = |A'| = |U| - |A| = 50 - 20 = 30\n\nNow, we need to show that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to U. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements that are in either of the sets. Since A is a subset of U and A' contains all elements in U that are not in A, the union of A and A' will contain all elements in U.\n\nTherefore, A âˆª A' = U.\n\nIn conclusion, the cardinality of the complement of A is 30, and the union of A and its complement is equal to U."
