The search space is between x = -10 and x = 10.",
    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the HS parameters: Harmony Memory Size (HMS), Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR), Pitch Adjusting Rate (PAR), and the number of iterations (NI).\n\n2. Generate an initial Harmony Memory (HM) matrix with randomly selected solutions within the search space.\n\n3. Improvise a new harmony vector based on the HMCR, PAR, and the search space.\n\n4. Update the Harmony Memory by comparing the new harmony vector with the worst harmony in the HM matrix.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the specified number of iterations (NI).\n\n6. Select the best harmony vector from the HM matrix as the optimal solution.\n\nFor this problem, let's set the following parameters:\n- HMS = 5\n- HMCR = 0.8\n- PAR = 0.3\n- NI = 1000\n\nNow, let's perform the Harmony Search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters.\n\n2. Generate an initial HM matrix with 5 random solutions within the search space (x = -10 to x = 10). For example:\n\n   HM = [-8.5, 3.2, 6.7, -2.1, 9.4]\n\n3. Improvise a new harmony vector based on the HMCR, PAR, and the search space. For each iteration, we will create a new harmony vector by selecting a value from the HM matrix with a probability of HMCR or randomly from the search space with a probability of (1 - HMCR). If a value is selected from the HM matrix, we will adjust it with a probability of PAR by adding a random pitch within the search space.\n\n4. Update the HM matrix by comparing the new harmony vector with the worst harmony in the HM matrix. If the new harmony vector has a better objective function value, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony vector.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for 1000 iterations.\n\n6. After 1000 iterations, select the best harmony vector from the HM matrix as the optimal solution.\n\nLet's assume after performing the Harmony Search algorithm, we obtain the following updated HM matrix:\n\n   HM = [0.9, 1.1, 1.05, 0.95, 1.2]\n\nThe best harmony vector is the one with the lowest objective function value. In this case, it's x = 0.95, which is close to the true minimum of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1.\n\nNow, let's find the optimal value of the objective function f(x) using the best harmony vector:\n\nf(0.95) = (0.95)^2 - 2(0.95) + 1 â‰ˆ 0.0025\n\nSo, the optimal solution of the objective function f(x) is approximately x = 0.95, and the corresponding optimal value is approximately 0.0025."
