    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I must inform you that Goldbach's Conjecture is an unsolved problem in number theory. It states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Since this conjecture has not been proven or disproven, it is not possible to provide the smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers according to the conjecture."
