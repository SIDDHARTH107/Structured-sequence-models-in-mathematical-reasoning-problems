    "message_2": "The complement of a set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements that are not in set A. Since set A has 20 elements, its complement A' contains all the elements that are not in A. Therefore, there are no elements that are both in set A and its complement A'. The intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set.\n\nThe number of elements in the intersection of set A and its complement A' is 0."
