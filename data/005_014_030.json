    "message_1": "In a factor analysis of a set of 30 test scores, 5 factors were extracted. If the first factor had an eigenvalue of 6.8, what percentage of the total variance is explained by the first factor?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of the total variance explained by the first factor, we need to first find the total variance. Since there are 30 test scores, the total variance is equal to the number of test scores, which is 30.\n\nNext, we need to find the proportion of the variance explained by the first factor. To do this, we divide the eigenvalue of the first factor by the total variance:\n\nProportion of variance explained by the first factor = (Eigenvalue of the first factor) / (Total variance)\nProportion of variance explained by the first factor = 6.8 / 30\n\nNow, we need to convert this proportion to a percentage:\n\nPercentage of variance explained by the first factor = (Proportion of variance explained by the first factor) * 100\nPercentage of variance explained by the first factor = (6.8 / 30) * 100 â‰ˆ 22.67%\n\nSo, approximately 22.67% of the total variance is explained by the first factor."
