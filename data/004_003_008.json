    "message_2": "Let the length of the fence parallel to the river be x meters, and the length of the other two sides be y meters each. Since one side of the plot doesn't need a fence, we have the following equation for the total length of the fence:\n\nx + 2y = 120\n\nWe want to find the maximum area of the plot, which can be represented as A = xy. To find the maximum area, we need to express the area in terms of one variable. We can solve the fence length equation for x:\n\nx = 120 - 2y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the area equation:\n\nA = (120 - 2y)y\n\nA = 120y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dy = 120 - 4y = 0\n\nSolving for y:\n\n4y = 120\ny = 30\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 120 - 2(30)\nx = 120 - 60\nx = 60\n\nSo, the dimensions of the plot that give the maximum area are 60 meters parallel to the river and 30 meters perpendicular to the river. The maximum area of the plot is:\n\nA = xy = 60 * 30 = 1800 square meters"
