    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers, we can apply the Sylow theorems.\n\nBy the first Sylow theorem, G has a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they are both normal in G (as they are the only conjugates of themselves). Let P = <a> and Q = <b>, where a has order 5 and b has order 7.\n\nNow, consider the product of elements from P and Q: pq, where p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Since P and Q are normal in G, we have:\n\n(pq)^5 = p^5q^5 = e, since a^5 = e and b^5 = b^(-2) ∈ Q.\nSimilarly, (pq)^7 = p^7q^7 = e, since a^7 = a^2 ∈ P and b^7 = e.\n\nThus, the order of pq divides both 5 and 7, which are prime numbers. The only possibility is that the order of pq is 1, which means pq = e. Therefore, P and Q have trivial intersection, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}.\n\nNow, consider the set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Since |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, and P ∩ Q = {e}, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 35. Moreover, PQ is a subgroup of G (as P and Q are normal in G), and since |PQ| = |G|, we have PQ = G.\n\nThus, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, i.e., G ≅ C_5 × C_7.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 35 is either cyclic (if it has an element of order 35) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
