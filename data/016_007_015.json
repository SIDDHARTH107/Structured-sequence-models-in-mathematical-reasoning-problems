    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole larger cube are removed, leaving 20 smaller cubes.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the total surface area of the Menger sponge can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 20^n * 6 * (s/3^n)^2\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations, s is the side length of the initial cube, and 3^n is the scaling factor for each iteration.\n\nFor our problem, n = 4 and s = 3 cm.\n\nTotal Surface Area = 20^4 * 6 * (3/3^4)^2\nTotal Surface Area = 160000 * 6 * (3/81)^2\nTotal Surface Area = 960000 * (1/27)^2\nTotal Surface Area = 960000 * (1/729)\nTotal Surface Area = 960000/729\n\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 1316.84 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of a Menger sponge after 4 iterations with an initial side length of 3 cm is approximately 1316.84 cm²."
