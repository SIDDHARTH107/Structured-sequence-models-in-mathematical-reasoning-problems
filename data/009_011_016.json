    "message_1": "A town has a population of 50,000 people. An infectious disease is spreading through the town at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals. The rate of change of infected individuals is given by the differential equation I' = kI, where I is the number of infected individuals and k is the constant of proportionality. Initially, there are 100 infected individuals. If the constant of proportionality is 0.02, then what is the number of infected individuals after 10 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the differential equation I'(t) = kI(t) with the initial condition I(0) = 100. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, and its general solution is given by I(t) = I(0)e^(kt), where t is the time in days.\n\nGiven the constant of proportionality k = 0.02 and the initial number of infected individuals I(0) = 100, we can find the number of infected individuals after 10 days:\n\nI(10) = 100 * e^(0.02 * 10)\n\nI(10) = 100 * e^0.2\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that e^0.2 ≈ 1.2214.\n\nSo, I(10) ≈ 100 * 1.2214 = 122.14\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an infected individual, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there will be approximately 122 infected individuals after 10 days."
