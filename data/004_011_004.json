    "message_1": "A ladder 10 feet long is leaning against a wall. The base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall? (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 feet long, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\nWe are also given that the base of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, so dx/dt = 2 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt when x = 6 feet.\n\nTo find dy/dt, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt. When x = 6 feet, we can find the corresponding value of y using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 100 - 36 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the equation:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -24\ndy/dt = -24/16 = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -1.5 feet per second when the base of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall."
