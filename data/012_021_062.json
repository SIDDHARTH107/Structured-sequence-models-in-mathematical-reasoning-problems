In our case, with $h=4$, the tree has $2^{4+1} - 1 = 31$ nodes.\n\nThe treewidth of a graph is the minimum size of a tree decomposition minus one. A tree decomposition of a graph is a tree where each node is a bag of vertices, and the tree satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge in the graph, there is a bag containing both its endpoints.\n3. For each vertex in the graph, the set of bags containing that vertex forms a connected subtree.\n\nFor a complete binary tree, we can construct a tree decomposition as follows:\n\n1. Create a bag for each node in the binary tree.\n2. Include the node itself and its parent in the bag.\n3. Connect the bags according to the parent-child relationship in the binary tree.\n\nThis tree decomposition satisfies the conditions mentioned above. The size of each bag is 2, as it contains a node and its parent. Therefore, the treewidth of the complete binary tree is the size of the largest bag minus one, which is $2 - 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, the treewidth of a complete binary tree of height $h=4$ is 1."
