    "message_1": "A company produces a new brand of cereal and wants to test the effectiveness of their advertising campaign. They randomly select 100 households and divide them into two groups: 50 receive a coupon for a free box of cereal in the mail, while the other 50 do not. After two weeks, they survey all households to see how many have purchased the cereal. Of the households who received a coupon, 35 purchased the cereal, while only 15 of the households who did not receive a coupon purchased the cereal. Calculate the experimental probability that a household will purchase the cereal if they receive a coupon.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the experimental probability, we need to divide the number of successful outcomes (households that received a coupon and purchased the cereal) by the total number of trials (households that received a coupon).\n\nIn this case, the number of successful outcomes is 35 (households that received a coupon and purchased the cereal), and the total number of trials is 50 (households that received a coupon).\n\nExperimental probability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of trials)\nExperimental probability = 35 / 50\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\nExperimental probability = 7 / 10\n\nSo, the experimental probability that a household will purchase the cereal if they receive a coupon is 7/10 or 0.7 (70%)."
