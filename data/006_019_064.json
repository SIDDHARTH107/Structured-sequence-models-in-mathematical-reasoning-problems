    "message_1": "In a certain country, the probability of a political party winning the election is 0.65. If there are 3 major political parties contesting in the election, what is the probability that none of the remaining parties will win?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that the first party wins, B be the event that the second party wins, and C be the event that the third party wins. We are given that P(A) = 0.65. We want to find the probability that neither B nor C wins, which is P(B' ∩ C'), where B' and C' are the complements of B and C, respectively.\n\nSince there are only 3 major parties, the probabilities of the other two parties winning must add up to 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35. Let P(B) = x and P(C) = 0.35 - x.\n\nWe know that P(B' ∩ C') = P(B') * P(C') if B and C are independent events. However, we cannot assume that B and C are independent, as the probabilities of the parties winning are likely to be related.\n\nInstead, we can use the formula for the probability of the complement of the union of two events:\n\nP(B' ∩ C') = 1 - P(B ∪ C)\n\nWe know that:\n\nP(B ∪ C) = P(B) + P(C) - P(B ∩ C)\n\nSince B and C are mutually exclusive events (only one party can win the election), we have:\n\nP(B ∩ C) = 0\n\nSo, P(B ∪ C) = P(B) + P(C) = x + (0.35 - x) = 0.35\n\nNow we can find the probability that neither B nor C wins:\n\nP(B' ∩ C') = 1 - P(B ∪ C) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65"
