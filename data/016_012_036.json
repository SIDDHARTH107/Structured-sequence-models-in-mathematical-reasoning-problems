    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it can be iteratively constructed to fill a square. In each iteration, the curve is divided into smaller sub-segments. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the first iteration, the curve has 3 sub-segments, each of length 1. So the total length is 3.\n\nFor the second iteration, each of the 3 sub-segments is replaced by 3 smaller sub-segments, making a total of 3^2 = 9 sub-segments, each of length 1. So the total length is 9.\n\nFor the third iteration, each of the 9 sub-segments is replaced by 3 smaller sub-segments, making a total of 3^3 = 27 sub-segments, each of length 1. So the total length is 27.\n\nFor the fourth iteration, each of the 27 sub-segments is replaced by 3 smaller sub-segments, making a total of 3^4 = 81 sub-segments, each of length 1. So the total length is 81.\n\nTherefore, the length of the Peano curve constructed by using the first four iterations of the construction process, with each sub-segment having a length of 1, is 81."
