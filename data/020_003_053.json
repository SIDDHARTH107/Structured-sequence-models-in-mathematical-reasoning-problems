    "message_2": "To find the point where the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7 attains its minimum value, we can use the method of completing the square or by finding the derivative and setting it to zero.\n\n1. Completing the square:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7\n= (x^2 - 4x + 4) + 7 - 4\n= (x - 2)^2 + 3\n\nSince the square of any real number is non-negative, the minimum value of (x - 2)^2 is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) occurs when (x - 2)^2 = 0, which implies x = 2. At this point, f(x) = (2 - 2)^2 + 3 = 3.\n\n2. Derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical points:\n\n2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nSince the function is a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient, it is a convex function, and the critical point corresponds to the minimum value. Thus, the minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = 2, and f(x) = (2 - 2)^2 + 3 = 3.\n\nIn both methods, we find that the function f(x) attains its minimum value of 3 at the point x = 2."
