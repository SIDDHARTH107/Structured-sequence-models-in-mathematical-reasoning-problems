    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle $|z-1|=1$ under the conformal mapping $w=f(z)$, we first parameterize the circle using polar coordinates. Let $z=1+e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Now, we can find the image of the circle by plugging this parameterization into the function $f(z)$:\n\n$$w=f(z)=f(1+e^{i\\theta})=(1+e^{i\\theta})^2+2(1+e^{i\\theta})+1.$$\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\n$$w=(1+2e^{i\\theta}+e^{2i\\theta})+2(1+e^{i\\theta})+1=1+2e^{i\\theta}+e^{2i\\theta}+2+2e^{i\\theta}=4+4e^{i\\theta}+e^{2i\\theta}.$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite this expression in polar form:\n\n$$w=4(1+e^{i\\theta})+e^{2i\\theta}.$$\n\nTo find the image of the circle, we need to find the locus of points described by this expression as $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Notice that the term $4(1+e^{i\\theta})$ describes a circle centered at $4$ with a radius of $4$, and the term $e^{2i\\theta}$ describes a circle centered at the origin with a radius of $1$. \n\nAs $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$, the term $4(1+e^{i\\theta})$ traces the circle centered at $4$ with a radius of $4$, while the term $e^{2i\\theta}$ traces the circle centered at the origin with a radius of $1$. The sum of these two terms will trace an ellipse centered at $4$ with semi-major axis $4$ and semi-minor axis $1$.\n\nTherefore, the image of the circle $|z-1|=1$ under the conformal mapping $w=f(z)$ is an ellipse centered at $4$ with semi-major axis $4$ and semi-minor axis $1$."
