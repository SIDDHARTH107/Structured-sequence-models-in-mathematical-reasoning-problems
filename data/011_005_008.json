    "message_2": "To solve this combination problem, we will use the formula nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of options (10 ice cream flavors) and r is the number of choices we want to make (3 different flavors).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n10C3 = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n(10-3)! = 7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula:\n\n10C3 = 3,628,800 / (6 × 5,040)\n\n10C3 = 3,628,800 / 30,240\n\n10C3 = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to choose 3 different ice cream flavors out of 10 options."
