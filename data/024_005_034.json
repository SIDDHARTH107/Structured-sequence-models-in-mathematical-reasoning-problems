    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the gradient of the given surface equation.\n\nThe surface equation is given by:\n$F(x, y, z) = x^2 + 2y^2 - 3z^2 + 4xy + 6yz - 12 = 0$\n\nNow, we compute the gradient of F:\n$\\nabla F = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}\\right) = (2x + 4y, 4y + 6z, -6z + 6y)$\n\nAt the point $(-2, 1, 1)$, the gradient is:\n$\\nabla F(-2, 1, 1) = (-4, 10, 0)$\n\nNow, we find the tangent plane at the given point. The equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n$-4(x + 2) + 10(y - 1) = 0$\n\nNow, we parameterize the surface by finding two tangent vectors on the tangent plane. Let's choose two points on the tangent plane, say $(0, 1, 1)$ and $(-2, 2, 1)$. Then, we have two tangent vectors:\n$T_1 = (0 + 2, 1 - 1, 1 - 1) = (2, 0, 0)$\n$T_2 = (-2 + 2, 2 - 1, 1 - 1) = (0, 1, 0)$\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form. The coefficients are given by:\n$E = T_1 \\cdot T_1 = 2^2 = 4$\n$F = T_1 \\cdot T_2 = 2 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n$G = T_2 \\cdot T_2 = 1^2 = 1$\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form. The coefficients are given by the second derivatives of the surface equation:\n$L = \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x^2} = 2$\n$M = \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 4$\n$N = \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y^2} = 4$\n\nNow, we compute the principal curvatures using the first and second fundamental forms. The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the matrix:\n$\\begin{pmatrix}\nL & M \\\\\nM & N\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 4 \\\\\n4 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe characteristic equation is given by:\n$(2 - \\lambda)(4 - \\lambda) - 4^2 = 0$\n$\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 8 - 16 = 0$\n$\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda - 8 = 0$\n\nSolving for the eigenvalues, we get:\n$\\lambda_1 = 3 - \\sqrt{17}$\n$\\lambda_2 = 3 + \\sqrt{17}$\n\nThus, the principal curvatures at the point $(-2, 1, 1)$ are $3 - \\sqrt{17}$ and $3 + \\sqrt{17}$."
