    "message_1": "A charity wants to auction off a unique, one-of-a-kind painting. There are three potential bidders, each with their own independent valuation of the painting. Bidder 1 values the painting at $10,000, Bidder 2 values it at $8,000, and Bidder 3 values it at $12,000. The charity wants to maximize profits from the auction.\n\nDesign an auction mechanism that will maximize the charity's profits, and determine the winning bidder and the payment they make if your mechanism is followed.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the charity's profits, we can use a second-price sealed-bid auction, also known as a Vickrey auction. In this auction mechanism, each bidder submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the item but pays the second-highest bid price.\n\nHere's how the auction would work for this scenario:\n\n1. Each bidder submits a sealed bid with their valuation of the painting.\n2. The bids are opened, and the highest bidder is determined.\n3. The highest bidder wins the painting but pays the second-highest bid price.\n\nIn this case, the bids would be as follows:\n\n- Bidder 1: $10,000\n- Bidder 2: $8,000\n- Bidder 3: $12,000\n\nBidder 3 has the highest bid at $12,000, so they would win the painting. However, they would pay the second-highest bid price, which is $10,000 from Bidder 1.\n\nSo, the winning bidder is Bidder 3, and they would pay $10,000 for the painting, maximizing the charity's profits."
