    "message_2": "To find the diameter of G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in G. We can do this by finding the shortest path between all pairs of vertices and then taking the maximum of these shortest paths.\n\nWe can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. The algorithm works by iteratively improving the shortest path estimates by considering intermediate vertices.\n\nAfter applying the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to the given adjacency matrix, we get the following matrix of shortest path lengths:\n\n$$\n\\begin{matrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 3 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{matrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value in this matrix, which is the diameter of G. The maximum value is 3, so the diameter of G is 3."
