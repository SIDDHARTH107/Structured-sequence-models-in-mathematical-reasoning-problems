    "message_1": "A company makes three different types of products, Product A, Product B, and Product C. The company has 250 units of raw material available and at least 100 hours of labor available per day. All three products require 1 unit of raw material per unit produced, and the amount of labor required to produce each unit of each product is as follows:\n\n- Product A: 2 hours of labor\n- Product B: 3 hours of labor\n- Product C: 4 hours of labor\n\nProduct A sells for $10 per unit, Product B sells for $12 per unit, and Product C sells for $15 per unit. The company wants to determine the production quantities of each product that will maximize their total profit.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can earn per day, and how many units of each product should the company produce to achieve this maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z represent the number of units produced for Product A, Product B, and Product C, respectively. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: x + y + z ≤ 250\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 3y + 4z ≤ 100\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 12y + 15z\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the points where the constraints intersect:\n\n1. x + y + z = 250 and 2x + 3y + 4z = 100\n   Solving this system of equations, we get x = 50, y = 0, and z = 200.\n\n2. x + y + z = 250 and 2x + 3y + 4z = 0\n   Solving this system of equations, we get x = 250, y = 0, and z = 0.\n\n3. x + y + z = 0 and 2x + 3y + 4z = 100\n   Solving this system of equations, we get x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0.\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function at these points:\n\n1. Profit(50, 0, 200) = 10(50) + 12(0) + 15(200) = 500 + 0 + 3000 = 3500\n2. Profit(250, 0, 0) = 10(250) + 12(0) + 15(0) = 2500 + 0 + 0 = 2500\n3. Profit(0, 0, 0) = 10(0) + 12(0) + 15(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nThe maximum profit is $3500 per day, and the company should produce 50 units of Product A and 200 units of Product C to achieve this maximum profit."
