    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle with radius r = 6 cm. The area of the base (A_base) can be found using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA_base = πr^2\nA_base = π(6 cm)^2\nA_base = 36π cm^2\n\nThe lateral surface area (A_lateral) can be found using the formula for the lateral surface area of a cone:\n\nA_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height.\n\nGiven that the slant height s = 10 cm, we can calculate the lateral surface area:\n\nA_lateral = π(6 cm)(10 cm)\nA_lateral = 60π cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area (A_total) by adding the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 36π cm^2 + 60π cm^2\nA_total = 96π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 96π cm^2."
