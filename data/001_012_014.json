    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n16x^3 - 24x^2 = 8x^2(2x - 3)\n\nDenominator:\n8x^2 - 12x = 4x(2x - 3)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(8x^2(2x - 3)) / (4x(2x - 3))\n\nSince both the numerator and the denominator have the common factor (2x - 3), we can cancel it out:\n\n(8x^2) / (4x)\n\nNow, we can simplify the remaining expression by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor, which is 4x:\n\n(8x^2) / (4x) = (2x)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n2x"
