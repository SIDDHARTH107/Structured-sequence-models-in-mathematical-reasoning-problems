    "message_2": "To calculate the principal components of the dataset, we first need to standardize the data. Standardizing the data means transforming the scores in each subject so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each subject.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix is a square matrix that shows the covariance between each pair of subjects. Covariance is a measure of how much two variables change together.\n\nOnce we have the covariance matrix, we can find its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance captured by each principal component.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the principal components:\n\n1. Standardize the data for each subject.\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix.\n3. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n4. Sort the eigenvectors by their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order.\n\nUnfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform these calculations directly. However, you can use software like Python with libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn to perform these calculations.
