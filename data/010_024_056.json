    "message_2": "A hyperbolic cylinder is not a standard geometric shape with a simple formula for calculating its volume. However, we can still find the volume using calculus and the equation for a hyperbola.\n\nThe equation for a hyperbola with a radius of 2 units is:\n\nx^2 - y^2 = 4\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\ny^2 = x^2 - 4\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the hyperbolic cylinder by integrating the area of the cross-sections of the cylinder along the height (z-axis). The cross-sectional area is given by the formula:\n\nA(x) = 2 * pi * y * dx\n\nSubstituting y^2 from the hyperbola equation:\n\nA(x) = 2 * pi * sqrt(x^2 - 4) * dx\n\nNow, we integrate A(x) along the x-axis from x = -h/2 to x = h/2, where h is the height of the cylinder:\n\nV = ∫[-h/2, h/2] 2 * pi * sqrt(x^2 - 4) * dx\n\nFor the given height of 5 units:\n\nV = ∫[-2.5, 2.5] 2 * pi * sqrt(x^2 - 4) * dx\n\nThis integral does not have a simple closed-form solution, so we would need to use numerical methods to find the volume. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a computer software, we can approximate the volume of the hyperbolic cylinder.\n\nKeep in mind that this is not a standard geometric shape, and the volume will depend on the specific equation of the hyperbola and the height of the cylinder."
