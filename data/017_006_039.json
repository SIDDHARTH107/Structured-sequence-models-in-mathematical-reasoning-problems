    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers. According to the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups in G.\n\nLet n_5 and n_7 denote the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups, respectively. By Sylow's third theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_7 divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFrom condition 1, we can see that n_5 can only be 1, since it must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Similarly, from condition 2, we can see that n_7 can only be 1, since it must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n\nNow, let P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be the unique Sylow 7-subgroup. Since n_5 = n_7 = 1, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G. Moreover, we have:\n\n|P| = 5 and |Q| = 7\n\nSince 5 and 7 are prime numbers and the orders of P and Q are 5 and 7, respectively, both P and Q are cyclic groups. Let p be a generator of P and q be a generator of Q. Now, we will show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q.\n\nConsider the element g = pq in G. Since P and Q are normal subgroups, we have:\n\ng^{|G|} = (pq)^{35} = p^{35}q^{35} = (p^5)^7(q^7)^5 = e\n\nHere, e is the identity element of G. Since the order of g divides 35, the possible orders of g are 1, 5, 7, or 35. If the order of g is 35, then G is cyclic, generated by g.\n\nIf the order of g is not 35, then it must be either 5 or 7. Without loss of generality, assume the order of g is 5. Then, we have:\n\ng^5 = (pq)^5 = p^5q^5 = eq^5\n\nThis implies that q^5 = e, which means that the order of q divides 5. However, this contradicts the fact that the order of q is 7. Therefore, the order of g cannot be 5 or 7, and it must be 35.\n\nThus, G is cyclic, generated by g = pq. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, since every element of G can be uniquely written as a product of an element from P and an element from Q."
