    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be found using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (edge length)^2\n\nIn this case, the edge length is 5 centimeters. So, the surface area is:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (5 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 6 * 25 cm^2\nSurface Area = 150 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
