    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude and period of the sinusoidal function f(x) = 2sin(3x - π/4), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function, which is:\n\nf(x) = A sin(Bx - C)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our given function, f(x) = 2sin(3x - π/4), we can identify the following:\n\nA = 2\nB = 3\n\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is:\n\nAmplitude = |A| = |2| = 2\n\nTo find the period, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |B|\n\nIn our case, B = 3, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |3| = 2π / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function is 2, and the period is 2π/3."
