    "message_1": "Let's say we have a surface with constant curvature $k=-1$, and a non-zero genus $g=2$. What is the Euler characteristic of the surface, and what is the total Gaussian curvature over the surface?",
    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of the surface, we can use the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic (χ) = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. However, for a surface of genus g, there is a more convenient formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nGiven that the genus g = 2, we can find the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nNow, to find the total Gaussian curvature over the surface, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the total Gaussian curvature (K) is related to the Euler characteristic (χ) by the following formula:\n\nK = 2πχ\n\nSubstituting the value of χ, we get:\n\nK = 2π(-2) = -4π\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the surface is -2, and the total Gaussian curvature over the surface is -4π."
