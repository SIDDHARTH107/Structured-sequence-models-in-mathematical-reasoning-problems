    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the symmetric difference of the two sets. Show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. This is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A Δ B with A and B, respectively:\n\n(A Δ B) x A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n(A Δ B) x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) x A ≠ (A Δ B) x B. Therefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
