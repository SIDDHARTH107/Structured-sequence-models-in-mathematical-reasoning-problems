    "message_2": "First, we can notice that all three equations are multiples of each other. Let's divide each equation by their respective constant to simplify the system:\n\nDivide the first equation by 2:\nx + 2y + 3z = 5\n\nDivide the second equation by 3:\nx + 2y + 3z = 5\n\nDivide the third equation by 4:\nx + 2y + 3z = 5\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and they all lie on the same plane in three-dimensional space. \n\nTo express the solutions, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other two. Let's solve for z in terms of x and y:\n\nFrom the simplified equation, x + 2y + 3z = 5, we can isolate z:\n\n3z = 5 - x - 2y\n\nz = (5 - x - 2y) / 3\n\nSo the solutions can be expressed as (x, y, (5 - x - 2y) / 3), where x and y can be any real numbers."
