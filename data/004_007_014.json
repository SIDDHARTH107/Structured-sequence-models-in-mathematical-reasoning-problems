    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(x) and the inner function is g(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 5x + 2) = 6x - 5\n\ng(x) = sin(x)\ng'(x) = d/dx (sin(x)) = cos(x)\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of h(x) = f(g(x)).\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nWe know that f'(x) = 6x - 5 and g'(x) = cos(x), so we can substitute these expressions into the chain rule formula:\n\nh'(x) = (6g(x) - 5) * cos(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of h'(x) at x = pi/2. First, let's find the value of g(pi/2):\n\ng(pi/2) = sin(pi/2) = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the expression for h'(x):\n\nh'(pi/2) = (6 * 1 - 5) * cos(pi/2)\n\nSince cos(pi/2) = 0, the expression simplifies to:\n\nh'(pi/2) = (6 - 5) * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the derivative of the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)) at x = pi/2 is 0."
