    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2/2] | from -π to π = (1/π) * (π^2/2 - (-π^2/2)) = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(n * x) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = cos(n * x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (1/n) * sin(n * x).\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * x * sin(n * x) | from -π to π - (1/n) * ∫[-π, π] sin(n * x) dx]\n\nThe first term in the brackets evaluates to 0, and the integral of sin(n * x) is (-1/n) * cos(n * x). So, we have:\n\na_n = (1/π) * (1/n^2) * [cos(n * x)] | from -π to π\n\nThis evaluates to 0 for all n, so a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts again, let u = x and dv = sin(n * x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x).\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * x * cos(n * x) | from -π to π + (1/n) * ∫[-π, π] cos(n * x) dx]\n\nThe first term in the brackets evaluates to 2 * π / n for odd n and 0 for even n. The integral of cos(n * x) is (1/n) * sin(n * x), which evaluates to 0 from -π to π. So, we have:\n\nb_n = (2 * π / n) for odd n and 0 for even n.\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π]:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2 * π / n) * sin(n * x)] for odd n\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
