    "message_2": "The problem you're describing is known as the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Although this conjecture has not been proven, it has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values, and it appears to hold true.\n\nTo find the number of ways an even number greater than or equal to 4 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Generate a list of prime numbers up to the given even number.\n2. For each prime number in the list, check if the difference between the even number and the prime number is also a prime number.\n3. If the difference is a prime number, count this as a valid way to express the even number as the sum of two prime numbers.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef goldbach_partitions(n):\n    if n <= 3 or n % 2 != 0:\n        return 0\n\n    primes = [x for x in range(2, n) if is_prime(x)]\n    count = 0\n\n    for prime in primes:\n        if is_prime(n - prime):\n            count += 1\n\n    return count // 2\n```\n\nThis function takes an even integer `n` as input and returns the number of ways it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Note that the result is divided by 2 to account for duplicate pairs (e.g., 7 + 5 and 5 + 7).\n\nYou can use this function to find the number of ways any even number greater than or equal to 4 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, `goldbach_partitions(6)` returns 1, as 6 can be expressed as 3 + 3."
