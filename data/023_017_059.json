    "message_2": "To calculate the volume flow rate of the fluid, we need to integrate the velocity profile u(r) over the cross-sectional area of the pipe. The volume flow rate Q can be expressed as:\n\nQ = ∫∫ u(r) dA\n\nwhere dA is the differential area element.\n\nFor a pipe with a circular cross-section, we can use polar coordinates to express dA as:\n\ndA = r dr dθ\n\nThe limits of integration for r will be from 0 to the pipe radius (5 cm) and for θ will be from 0 to 2π. Thus, the volume flow rate Q can be calculated as:\n\nQ = ∫(from 0 to 2π) ∫(from 0 to 5) 8r * r dr dθ\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to r:\n\nQ = ∫(from 0 to 2π) [ (8/3)r^3 ](from 0 to 5) dθ\n\nQ = ∫(from 0 to 2π) ( (8/3)(5^3) - (8/3)(0^3) ) dθ\n\nQ = ∫(from 0 to 2π) ( (8/3)(125) ) dθ\n\nNow, we integrate with respect to θ:\n\nQ = ( (8/3)(125) ) [ θ ](from 0 to 2π)\n\nQ = ( (8/3)(125) ) (2π - 0)\n\nQ = ( (8/3)(125) ) (2π)\n\nQ = (1000/3)π cm³/s\n\nSo, the volume flow rate of the fluid is approximately 1047.2 cm³/s."
