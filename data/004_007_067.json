    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = cos(3x + 2) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet g(x) = 3x + 2 and h(x) = cos(x). Then f(x) = h(g(x)). We want to find f'(x), which is the derivative of f(x) with respect to x.\n\nFirst, find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x) with respect to x:\n\ng'(x) = d(3x + 2)/dx = 3\n\nh'(x) = d(cos(x))/dx = -sin(x)\n\nNow, apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = h'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nf'(x) = -sin(3x + 2) * 3\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = cos(3x + 2) with respect to x is f'(x) = -3sin(3x + 2)."
