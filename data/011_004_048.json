    "message_1": "In a group of 20 students, there are 6 international students, 8 local students, and 6 exchange students. How many ways are there to form a committee of 4 students consisting of one student from each of the three categories (international, local, exchange) and one additional member of any category?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to choose one student from each of the three categories:\n\n- International students: 6 choices\n- Local students: 8 choices\n- Exchange students: 6 choices\n\nSo far, we have 6 * 8 * 6 = 288 ways to choose one student from each category.\n\nNow, we need to choose one additional member from any category. There are a total of 20 students, but we have already chosen 3, so there are 17 students left to choose from.\n\nTherefore, there are 288 * 17 = 4896 ways to form a committee of 4 students with the given conditions."
