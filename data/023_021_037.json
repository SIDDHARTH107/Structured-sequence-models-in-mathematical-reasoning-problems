    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the magnetic field B(x, y, t) with respect to time, we will first rewrite the magnetic field function in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\ncos(2πt/5) = (e^(i(2πt/5)) + e^(-i(2πt/5)))/2\n\nThus, B(x, y, t) = 4 sin(πx/4) sin(πy/6) (e^(i(2πt/5)) + e^(-i(2πt/5)))/2\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of B(x, y, t) with respect to time, denoted as B(x, y, ω):\n\nB(x, y, ω) = ∫ B(x, y, t) e^(-iωt) dt\n\nSince the magnetic field function is separable, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nB(x, y, ω) = 4 sin(πx/4) sin(πy/6) ∫ (e^(i(2πt/5)) + e^(-i(2πt/5)))/2 e^(-iωt) dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nB(x, y, ω) = 2 sin(πx/4) sin(πy/6) [∫ e^(i(2πt/5)) e^(-iωt) dt + ∫ e^(-i(2πt/5)) e^(-iωt) dt]\n\nCombine the exponentials in each integral:\n\nB(x, y, ω) = 2 sin(πx/4) sin(πy/6) [∫ e^(i(2πt/5 - ωt)) dt + ∫ e^(-i(2πt/5 + ωt)) dt]\n\nNow, we can solve each integral:\n\nB(x, y, ω) = 2 sin(πx/4) sin(πy/6) [(1/i(2π/5 - ω)) e^(i(2πt/5 - ωt)) + (1/-i(2π/5 + ω)) e^(-i(2πt/5 + ωt))]\n\nSince the Fourier transform is defined over an infinite time range, the result will be non-zero only when the exponentials are zero. This occurs when ω = ±(2π/5). Therefore, the Fourier transform of the magnetic field with respect to time is:\n\nB(x, y, ω) = 2 sin(πx/4) sin(πy/6) [(1/i(2π/5 - ω)) δ(ω - 2π/5) + (1/-i(2π/5 + ω)) δ(ω + 2π/5)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function."
