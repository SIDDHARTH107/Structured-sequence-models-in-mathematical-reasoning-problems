    "message_1": "What are the distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 48 and for each class, provide its corresponding multiplication table and generators of the group?",
    "message_2": "There are 5 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 48. These are:\n\n1. C_48 (cyclic group of order 48)\n2. C_24 x C_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 24 and 2)\n3. C_12 x C_4 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 12 and 4)\n4. C_8 x C_6 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 8 and 6)\n5. D_48 (dihedral group of order 48)\n\nIt is not feasible to provide the full multiplication tables for each group here, as they would be 48x48 tables with 2304 entries each. However, I can provide the generators for each group:\n\n1. C_48: The generator is an element of order 48, denoted as a. The group elements are {1, a, a^2, ..., a^47}.\n2. C_24 x C_2: The generators are elements of orders 24 and 2, denoted as a and b, respectively. The group elements are {a^i * b^j | 0 <= i < 24, 0 <= j < 2}.\n3. C_12 x C_4: The generators are elements of orders 12 and 4, denoted as a and b, respectively. The group elements are {a^i * b^j | 0 <= i < 12, 0 <= j < 4}.\n4. C_8 x C_6: The generators are elements of orders 8 and 6, denoted as a and b, respectively. The group elements are {a^i * b^j | 0 <= i < 8, 0 <= j < 6}.\n5. D_48: The generators are an element of order 48 (rotation), denoted as a, and an element of order 2 (reflection), denoted as b. The group elements are {a^i, a^i * b | 0 <= i < 48}.\n\nTo find the multiplication tables, you can use the properties of cyclic groups and dihedral groups, along with the rules for direct products. For example, in a cyclic group, the product of two elements a^i and a^j is a^(i+j) (mod n), where n is the order of the group. In a dihedral group, the product of two elements a^i and a^j * b is a^(i+j) * b, and the product of two elements a^i * b and a^j * b is a^(i-j). For direct products, the product of two elements (a^i, b^j) and (a^k, b^l) is (a^(i+k), b^(j+l))."
