    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal that is created by dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the center square, then repeating the process for each of the remaining squares. In each iteration, the perimeter of the fractal increases.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the original square as P0 and the perimeter of the nth iteration as Pn. The perimeter of the Vicsek fractal after the first iteration (P1) can be calculated as follows:\n\nP1 = P0 * (5/3)\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the perimeter increases by a factor of (5/3). Therefore, the perimeter of the 6th iteration (P6) can be calculated as:\n\nP6 = P0 * (5/3)^6\n\nGiven that the original square has a perimeter of 20 units:\n\nP6 = 20 * (5/3)^6\nP6 ≈ 20 * 15.625\nP6 ≈ 312.50\n\nThe perimeter of the 6th iteration of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 312.50 units, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
