    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a hyperbolic triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area (A) of a hyperbolic triangle with angles α, β, and γ is given by:\n\nA = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given angles to radians:\n\n60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n75 degrees = (75 * π) / 180 = (5π/12) radians\n45 degrees = (45 * π) / 180 = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the angles into the formula:\n\nA = π - (π/3 + 5π/12 + π/4)\nA = π - (4π/12 + 5π/12 + 3π/12)\nA = π - (12π/12)\nA = π - π\nA = 0\n\nThe area of the hyperbolic triangle is 0. However, this result is not possible in hyperbolic geometry, as the sum of the angles in a hyperbolic triangle is always less than π (180 degrees). This indicates that the given side lengths and angles do not form a valid hyperbolic triangle."
