    "message_1": "The following is an example of a precise numerical problem on Game theory that a math student can solve:\n\nSuppose there are two players X and Y, who must each choose to either cooperate or defect in a one-shot game. If X defects and Y cooperates, X will receive a payoff of 5 and Y will receive a payoff of 0. If both players cooperate, they each receive a payoff of 3. If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of 1. What is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the payoffs for each player based on their choices. We can represent the payoffs in a matrix:\n\n```\n          Y\n          C   D\n        -------\nX C  |  3,3  0,5\n        -------\n  D  |  5,0  1,1\n```\n\nHere, the first number in each cell represents the payoff for player X, and the second number represents the payoff for player Y. C stands for \"cooperate\" and D stands for \"defect.\"\n\nNow, let's find the best responses for each player:\n\n1. If player X cooperates (C), player Y's best response is to defect (D) since 5 > 3.\n2. If player X defects (D), player Y's best response is also to defect (D) since 1 > 0.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n1. If player Y cooperates (C), player X's best response is to defect (D) since 5 > 3.\n2. If player Y defects (D), player X's best response is also to defect (D) since 1 > 0.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both players choose their best responses given the other player's choice. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when both players defect (D), resulting in a payoff of (1,1)."
