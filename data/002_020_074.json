    "message_1": "A pizza parlor makes a pizza with a diameter of 14 inches. If a customer orders a slice that makes up 45° of the pizza, what is the length of the crust edge on that slice?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the crust edge on the slice, we need to find the circumference of the entire pizza and then find the proportion of the circumference that corresponds to the 45° slice.\n\nFirst, let's find the circumference of the entire pizza. The formula for the circumference of a circle is:\n\nC = 2πr\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the pizza is 14 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 7 inches.\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 7\nC ≈ 43.98226 inches\n\nNow, we need to find the proportion of the circumference that corresponds to the 45° slice. Since there are 360° in a circle, the 45° slice makes up 45/360 = 1/8 of the circle.\n\nFinally, we can find the length of the crust edge on the slice by multiplying the circumference by the proportion:\n\nLength of crust edge = (1/8) * 43.98226\nLength of crust edge ≈ 5.49778 inches\n\nSo, the length of the crust edge on the 45° slice is approximately 5.50 inches."
