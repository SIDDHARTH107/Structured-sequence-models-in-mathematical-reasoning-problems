    "message_2": "1) An Eulerian path is a path that visits every edge exactly once. For a graph to have an Eulerian path, it must have either 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex). In this graph, all vertices have a degree of either 2 or 4, which means there are 0 vertices with an odd degree. Therefore, there is an Eulerian path in this graph. One possible Eulerian path is:\n\nA - B - C - F - E - B - D - E - H - G - D - A\n\n2) A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits every vertex exactly once. In this graph, there is a Hamiltonian path. One possible Hamiltonian path is:\n\nA - D - G - H - E - B - C - F - I - H - E - D"
