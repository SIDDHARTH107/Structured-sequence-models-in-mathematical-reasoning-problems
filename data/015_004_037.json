    "message_2": "The area of the black region in the Mandelbrot set plot within the square with corners at (-1, -1) and (1, 1) is approximately 1.51 square units. This value is an approximation because the Mandelbrot set has a fractal boundary, which makes it difficult to calculate the exact area."
