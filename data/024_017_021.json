    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$, we need to solve the following equation for the vector field $\\mathbf{V}(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{D\\mathbf{V}}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} \\mathbf{V} = 0$$\n\nwhere $\\frac{D\\mathbf{V}}{dt}$ is the covariant derivative of $\\mathbf{V}$ with respect to $t$, and $\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}$ is the covariant derivative along the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$:\n\n$$\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = (1, 2t, 3t^2)$$\n\nNow, let's write the vector field $\\mathbf{V}(t)$ as $\\mathbf{V}(t) = (V_1(t), V_2(t), V_3(t))$. The equation for the parallel transport becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\mathbf{V}}{dt} - \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} \\mathbf{V} = (V_1'(t), V_2'(t), V_3'(t)) - (1, 2t, 3t^2) \\cdot \\nabla (V_1(t), V_2(t), V_3(t)) = 0$$\n\nSince we are working in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the covariant derivative is the same as the regular derivative, so we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\mathbf{V}}{dt} - (1, 2t, 3t^2) \\cdot (\\nabla V_1(t), \\nabla V_2(t), \\nabla V_3(t)) = 0$$\n\nThis gives us three equations:\n\n$$V_1'(t) - (1, 2t, 3t^2) \\cdot \\nabla V_1(t) = 0$$\n$$V_2'(t) - (1, 2t, 3t^2) \\cdot \\nabla V_2(t) = 0$$\n$$V_3'(t) - (1, 2t, 3t^2) \\cdot \\nabla V_3(t) = 0$$\n\nSince the vector field $\\mathbf{V}(t)$ is parallel along the curve, the directional derivatives of its components along the tangent vector are zero:\n\n$$\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} V_1(t) = V_1'(t)$$\n$$\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} V_2(t) = V_2'(t)$$\n$$\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} V_3(t) = V_3'(t)$$\n\nThus, we have the following system of ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$V_1'(t) = 0$$\n$$V_2'(t) = 0$$\n$$V_3'(t) = 0$$\n\nwith the initial condition $\\mathbf{V}(0) = (1, 2, -1)$. Solving this system, we find that $\\mathbf{V}(t) = (1, 2, -1)$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nTherefore, the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v} = (1, 2, -1)$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$ is the constant vector field $\\mathbf{V}(t) = (1, 2, -1)$."
