    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, which means it exhibits self-similarity at different scales. However, the self-similarity is not exact, and the details of the set can vary at different zoom levels. The number of iterations required to determine the self-similarity of the Mandelbrot set depends on the level of detail and precision desired.\n\nTo calculate the maximum number of iterations required, we can use the formula:\n\niterations = log2(log2(zoom_factor) / log2(escape_radius))\n\nwhere zoom_factor is the factor by which we are zooming in (10 in this case), and escape_radius is the radius beyond which a point is considered to have escaped the Mandelbrot set (usually 2).\n\niterations = log2(log2(10) / log2(2))\niterations ≈ 3.32\n\nHowever, this formula provides an estimate for the number of iterations required to determine the self-similarity of the Mandelbrot set. In practice, the actual number of iterations may be higher, depending on the specific region of the set being examined and the desired level of detail.\n\nAdditionally, as we continue to zoom in by a factor of 10 at each step, the number of iterations required will increase. To maintain a consistent level of detail, we can multiply the initial number of iterations by the zoom factor raised to the power of the number of zoom steps.\n\nFor example, after 1 zoom step:\n\niterations = 3.32 * (10^1) ≈ 33.2\n\nAfter 2 zoom steps:\n\niterations = 3.32 * (10^2) ≈ 332\n\nAnd so on. Keep in mind that these values are approximate and may vary depending on the specific region of the Mandelbrot set being examined."
