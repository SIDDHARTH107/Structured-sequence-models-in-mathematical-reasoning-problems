    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the spherical balloon is 8 cm, we can plug in the value into the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (8 cm)^2\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * 64 cm^2\n\nSurface area = 256 * π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the spherical balloon is approximately 256π cm^2 or approximately 804.25 cm^2."
