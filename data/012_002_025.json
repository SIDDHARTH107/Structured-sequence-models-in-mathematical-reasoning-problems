    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the graph G:\n\nVertices: V = {a, b, c, d, e}\nEdges: E = {ab, ac, ad, bd, cd, de}\n\nThe graph can be visualized as follows:\n\na -- b -- d -- e\n \\  |     |\n  \\ |     |\n   \\|     |\n    c ----\n\nNow, let's try to color the graph using the smallest number of colors:\n\n1. Color vertex a with color 1.\n2. Vertex b is adjacent to a, so it must have a different color. Color b with color 2.\n3. Vertex c is adjacent to both a and b, so it must have a different color from both. Color c with color 3.\n4. Vertex d is adjacent to a, b, and c, so it must have a different color from all three. Color d with color 4.\n5. Vertex e is adjacent to d, so it must have a different color from d. However, e is not adjacent to a, b, or c, so it can have any of their colors. Color e with color 1.\n\nThe colored graph looks like this:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 4 -- 1\n \\  |     |\n  \\ |     |\n   \\|     |\n    3 ----\n\nWe have used 4 colors to properly color the graph G. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is 4."
