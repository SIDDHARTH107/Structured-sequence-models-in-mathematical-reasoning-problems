    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nSymmetric Difference (A Δ B) = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1, 2}\nB - A = {5, 6}\n\nSo, A Δ B = {1, 2} ∪ {5, 6} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection is the set of elements that are in both A and B.\n\nIntersection (A ∩ B) = {3, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the intersection. Commutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter. In other words, we need to show that (A Δ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) is not equal to (A ∩ B) ∩ (A Δ B).\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {3, 4} = ∅ (empty set)\n\n(A ∩ B) ∩ (A Δ B) = {3, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 5, 6} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nSince both expressions are equal to the empty set, the symmetric difference of A and B is actually commutative with respect to the intersection."
