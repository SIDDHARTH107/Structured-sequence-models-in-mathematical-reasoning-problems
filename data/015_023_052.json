    "message_2": "The Chirikov-Taylor map, also known as the standard map, is a two-dimensional area-preserving map defined by the following equations:\n\nx_n+1 = (x_n + p_n+1) mod 1\np_n+1 = (p_n + K * sin(2 * pi * x_n)) mod 1\n\nwhere x_n and p_n are the position and momentum at step n, respectively, and K is the parameter value.\n\nTo compute the largest Lyapunov exponent, we need to iterate the map and calculate the average growth rate of a small perturbation. The Lyapunov exponent is given by:\n\nλ = (1/N) * Σ(log|dF/dx|)\n\nwhere N is the number of iterations, and dF/dx is the Jacobian matrix of the map.\n\nLet's calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent for the given parameters:\n\nK = 2\nx0 = 0.5\np0 = 0.5\nN = 10,000\n\nFirst, we need to define the Jacobian matrix for the Chirikov-Taylor map:\n\ndF/dx = | 1, 1 | \n        | K * 2 * pi * cos(2 * pi * x_n), 1 |\n\nNow, we iterate the map for 10,000 steps and calculate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nK = 2\nx0 = 0.5\np0 = 0.5\nN = 10000\n\nx = x0\np = p0\nsum_log_jacobian = 0\n\nfor n in range(N):\n    jacobian = np.array([[1, 1], [K * 2 * np.pi * np.cos(2 * np.pi * x), 1]])\n    sum_log_jacobian += np.log(np.abs(np.linalg.det(jacobian)))\n    p = (p + K * np.sin(2 * np.pi * x)) % 1\n    x = (x + p) % 1\n\nlyapunov_exponent = sum_log_jacobian / N\n```\n\nThe largest Lyapunov exponent for the Chirikov-Taylor map with the given parameters is approximately 0.9624."
