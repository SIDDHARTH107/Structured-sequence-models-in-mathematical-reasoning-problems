    "message_2": "To prove the statement, we will show that if there exists an injective function from A to B, then there exists a surjective function from B to A, and vice versa.\n\nLet A = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} and B = {b1, b2, b3}.\n\nCase 1: If there exists an injective function from A to B\n\nAn injective function is a function where each element in the domain (A) maps to a unique element in the codomain (B). However, since A has 5 elements and B has only 3 elements, it is impossible to create an injective function from A to B, as there will always be at least two elements in A that map to the same element in B. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: If there exists a surjective function from B to A\n\nA surjective function is a function where every element in the codomain (A) is mapped to by at least one element in the domain (B). In this case, it is possible to create a surjective function from B to A. For example, consider the function f: B â†’ A, defined as:\n\nf(b1) = a1\nf(b2) = a2\nf(b3) = a3\n\nThis function is surjective because every element in A is mapped to by at least one element in B. However, there is no injective function from A to B, as shown in Case 1.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe given statement \"For any two sets A and B, there exists an injective function from A to B if and only if there exists a surjective function from B to A\" does not hold true for any sets A and B, where A has 5 elements and B has 3 elements. There can exist a surjective function from B to A, but there cannot exist an injective function from A to B."
