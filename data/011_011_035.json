    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to partition the number 10 into summands, we can use the partition function P(n). The partition function P(10) gives the number of ways to write the integer 10 as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the summands does not matter.\n\nUsing the partition function, P(10) = 42.\n\nSo, there are 42 ways to partition the number 10 into summands."
