    "message_2": "To use Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the given system of linear equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be written as:\n\nA = | 1  3  2 |      x = | x |      b = | 10 |\n    | 3 13  8 |          | y |          | 54 |\n    | 2  8  9 |          | z |          | 36 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. The Cholesky decomposition of A is given by A = L * L^T, where L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is its transpose.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the elements of the L matrix.\n\nL11 = sqrt(A11) = sqrt(1) = 1\nL21 = A21 / L11 = 3 / 1 = 3\nL31 = A31 / L11 = 2 / 1 = 2\n\nL22 = sqrt(A22 - L21^2) = sqrt(13 - 3^2) = sqrt(4) = 2\nL32 = (A32 - L31 * L21) / L22 = (8 - 2 * 3) / 2 = 1\n\nL33 = sqrt(A33 - L31^2 - L32^2) = sqrt(9 - 2^2 - 1^2) = sqrt(4) = 2\n\nSo, the L matrix is:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 3  2  0 |\n    | 2  1  2 |\n\nStep 2: Solve the system Ly = b for y.\n\n1 * y1 = 10 => y1 = 10\n3 * y1 + 2 * y2 = 54 => 3 * 10 + 2 * y2 = 54 => y2 = 6\n2 * y1 + 1 * y2 + 2 * y3 = 36 => 2 * 10 + 1 * 6 + 2 * y3 = 36 => y3 = 2\n\nSo, y = | 10 |\n         |  6 |\n         |  2 |\n\nStep 3: Solve the system L^T * x = y for x.\n\nL^T = | 1  3  2 |\n      | 0  2  1 |\n      | 0  0  2 |\n\n1 * x1 + 3 * x2 + 2 * x3 = 10\n2 * x2 + 1 * x3 = 6\n2 * x3 = 2\n\nFrom the last equation, x3 = 1. Now we can substitute this value into the second equation:\n\n2 * x2 + 1 = 6 => x2 = 2.5\n\nFinally, substitute the values of x2 and x3 into the first equation:\n\nx1 + 3 * 2.5 + 2 * 1 = 10 => x1 = 1\n\nSo, x = | 1 |\n         | 2.5 |\n         | 1 |\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2.5, and z = 1."
