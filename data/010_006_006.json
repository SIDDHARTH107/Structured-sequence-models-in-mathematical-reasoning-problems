Determine the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^1/\\gamma , [1])$, where $S^1/\\gamma$ denotes the quotient space obtained by identifying each point $x\\in S^1$ with its image $\\gamma(x)$ and $[1]$ is the equivalence class of the point $1\\in S^1$ under this identification.",
    "message_2": "Let's first consider the quotient space $S^1/\\gamma$. Since $\\gamma$ winds around the circle $n$ times in a counterclockwise direction, the quotient space can be obtained by taking the circle $S^1$ and identifying each point $x$ with its image $\\gamma(x)$, which is $n$ times around the circle from $x$. This is equivalent to taking the circle and \"gluing\" it together at every $1/n$ fraction of the circle, creating a space that looks like a \"circle with $n$ loops\" or a \"circle with $n$ petals\".\n\nNow, let's determine the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^1/\\gamma, [1])$. To do this, we can use the Van Kampen theorem, which states that if a space $X$ is the union of two open, path-connected sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A \\cap B$ is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of $X$ is the free product of the fundamental groups of $A$ and $B$ with respect to their intersection, i.e., $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(A) *_{\\pi_1(A \\cap B)} \\pi_1(B)$.\n\nLet $A$ be an open neighborhood of the circle that contains all the \"loops\" or \"petals\" except for a small neighborhood around the base point $[1]$, and let $B$ be an open neighborhood of the base point $[1]$ that contains a small portion of each \"loop\" or \"petal\". Then, $A \\cap B$ is an open annulus around the base point $[1]$.\n\nSince $A$ is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of $n$ circles, its fundamental group is the free group on $n$ generators, i.e., $\\pi_1(A) \\cong \\langle a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n \\rangle$. On the other hand, $B$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle, so its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(B) \\cong \\langle b \\rangle$. Finally, $A \\cap B$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle, so its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(A \\cap B) \\cong \\langle c \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we can apply the Van Kampen theorem to compute the fundamental group of $S^1/\\gamma$. Since $c$ is a loop in $A \\cap B$, it can be written as a product of loops in $A$ and $B$. In this case, $c$ is the product of the loops $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ in $A$ and the loop $b$ in $B$, i.e., $c = a_1a_2 \\dots a_nb$. Therefore, the fundamental group of $S^1/\\gamma$ is given by\n\n$$\\pi_1(S^1/\\gamma) \\cong \\langle a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, b \\mid a_1a_2 \\dots a_nb = c \\rangle.$$\n\nHowever, since $c$ is a loop in $A \\cap B$, it is homotopically trivial in $S^1/\\gamma$, so we can set $c = 1$. This gives us the fundamental group\n\n$$\\pi_1(S^1/\\gamma) \\cong \\langle a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, b \\mid a_1a_2 \\dots a_nb = 1 \\rangle.$$\n\nThis is the presentation of the fundamental group of the quotient space $S^1/\\gamma$ with base point $[1]$."
