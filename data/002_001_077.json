    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 6 cm and a height of 9 cm. What is its area in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 6 cm and the height is 9 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (6 cm × 9 cm) / 2\nArea = (54 cm²) / 2\nArea = 27 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 27 square centimeters."
