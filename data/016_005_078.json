    "message_1": "How many points are there in the Cantor set after the first n iterations of the construction process, where each iteration involves removing the middle 1/3 portion of each line segment? For example, after the first iteration, there are two line segments left, each 1/3 the length of the original, so there are two points in the Cantor set. After the second iteration, there are four line segments left, each 1/9 the length of the original, so there are four points in the Cantor set. What is the formula for the number of points after n iterations?",
    "message_2": "The number of points in the Cantor set after the first n iterations can be found using the following formula:\n\nNumber of points = 2^n - 1\n\nThis formula is derived from the fact that after each iteration, the number of points doubles, and we subtract 1 to account for the initial point (0) that is always part of the Cantor set.\n\nFor example, after the first iteration (n=1), there are 2^1 - 1 = 1 point in the Cantor set. After the second iteration (n=2), there are 2^2 - 1 = 3 points in the Cantor set. After the third iteration (n=3), there are 2^3 - 1 = 7 points in the Cantor set, and so on."
