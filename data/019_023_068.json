    "message_1": "Suppose you are given the following sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. Using inductive logic, what will be the next two numbers in the sequence?",
    "message_2": "The given sequence is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. We can observe that each number is double the previous number. Using this pattern, we can find the next two numbers in the sequence:\n\n6th number: 32 * 2 = 64\n7th number: 64 * 2 = 128\n\nSo, the next two numbers in the sequence are 64 and 128."
