    "message_2": "To graph the function y = 3cos(2x - pi), we first need to identify the amplitude, period, and phase shift.\n\nAmplitude: The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function, which in this case is 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a cosine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|, where B is the coefficient of x inside the cosine function. In this case, B = 2, so the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\nPhase Shift: The phase shift is given by the formula C/B, where C is the constant inside the cosine function. In this case, C = -π, so the phase shift is (-π)/2 = -π/2.\n\nNow, we can graph the function for values of x ranging from π/4 to 3π/4.\n\n1. Label the x-axis with values from π/4 to 3π/4.\n2. Label the y-axis with values from -3 to 3, as the amplitude is 3.\n3. Plot the points for the function y = 3cos(2x - π) for the given range of x values.\n4. Connect the points to form the graph of the function.\n\nOn the graph, indicate the following:\n\nAmplitude: Label a point on the y-axis at y = 3 and write \"Amplitude = 3\" next to it.\nPeriod: Label two consecutive peaks (or troughs) of the cosine function and write \"Period = π\" below the x-axis between these points.\nPhase Shift: Label the point on the x-axis where the cosine function starts (in this case, -π/2) and write \"Phase Shift = -π/2\" below the x-axis at that point.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph:\n\n```\n3|      /\\      /\\\n  |     /  \\    /  \\\n  |    /    \\  /    \\\n0 |---/------\\/------\\---\n  |  /        \\/      \\\n-3| /          \\        \\\n  |-------------------------\n   π/4       3π/4\n```"
