    "message_2": "To verify that (A x B) x C and A x (B x C) are equal, we will first find the Cartesian products of the sets and then compare the results.\n\n(A x B) x C:\nFirst, we find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of (A x B) and C, denoted as (A x B) x C. This is the set of all ordered pairs ((a, b), c) where (a, b) is in A x B and c is in C.\n\n(A x B) x C = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 4), 7), ((1, 5), 6), ((1, 5), 7), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 4), 7), ((2, 5), 6), ((2, 5), 7), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 4), 7), ((3, 5), 6), ((3, 5), 7)}\n\nA x (B x C):\nFirst, we find the Cartesian product of B and C, denoted as B x C. B x C is the set of all ordered pairs (b, c) where b is in B and c is in C.\n\nB x C = {(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of A and (B x C), denoted as A x (B x C). This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, (b, c)) where a is in A and (b, c) is in B x C.\n\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (4, 7)), (1, (5, 6)), (1, (5, 7)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (4, 7)), (2, (5, 6)), (2, (5, 7)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (4, 7)), (3, (5, 6)), (3, (5, 7))}\n\nNow, we will compare the two sets (A x B) x C and A x (B x C). We can see that the elements in both sets are different in their representation, but they can be mapped to each other in a one-to-one correspondence. For example, ((1, 4), 6) in (A x B) x C can be mapped to (1, (4, 6)) in A x (B x C). \n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is associative, we can rewrite the elements of both sets in a consistent format, such as (a, b, c). \n\n(A x B) x C in (a, b, c) format: {(1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 7), (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7), (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 6), (3, 5, 7)}\n\nA x (B x C) in (a, b, c) format: {(1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 7), (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7), (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 6), (3, 5, 7)}\n\nNow, we can see that both sets have the same elements, and thus, (A x B) x C = A x (B x C). This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative."
