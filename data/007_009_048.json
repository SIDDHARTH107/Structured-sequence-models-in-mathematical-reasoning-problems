    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), is used to count the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nTo find the value of φ(56), we first need to find the prime factorization of 56. The prime factorization of 56 is 2^3 × 7^1.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n × (1 - 1/p1) × (1 - 1/p2) × ... × (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nφ(56) = 56 × (1 - 1/2) × (1 - 1/7) = 56 × (1/2) × (6/7) = 28 × (6/7) = 24.\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function at 56 is 24."
