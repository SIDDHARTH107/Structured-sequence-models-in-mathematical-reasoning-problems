    "message_2": "If A ∩ B = ∅, it means that there are no common elements between sets A and B. The cardinality of A is 5 and the cardinality of B is 3. \n\nTo find the cardinality of the complement of A ∩ B in the universal set containing both sets A and B, we need to find the total number of elements in the union of sets A and B, which is represented as A ∪ B.\n\nSince there are no common elements between sets A and B, the cardinality of A ∪ B is the sum of the cardinalities of A and B:\n\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the complement of A ∩ B in the universal set containing both sets A and B is 8."
