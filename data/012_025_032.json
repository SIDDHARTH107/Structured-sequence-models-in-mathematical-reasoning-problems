If yes, write down such a cycle. If no, explain why a Hamiltonian cycle does not exist in the graph.",
    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in graph G.\n\nFirst, we can notice that vertex 6 is not connected to any other vertex, so it is impossible to include it in any cycle. Therefore, a Hamiltonian cycle does not exist in the graph G."
