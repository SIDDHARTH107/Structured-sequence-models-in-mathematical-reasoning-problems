    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this case, the graph G has 10 vertices with the degree sequence 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4. The maximum degree of the vertices in the graph is 4. According to Brooks' theorem, the chromatic number of a graph is at most Î”(G) (the maximum degree of the graph) unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\nSince the graph has vertices with degree 3, it cannot be a complete graph. Additionally, the graph cannot be an odd cycle because it has 10 vertices, which is an even number.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of the graph G is at most 4. However, without more information about the structure of the graph, we cannot determine if the chromatic number is less than 4. So, the chromatic number of the graph G is at most 4."
