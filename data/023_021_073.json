Assume that the wave is propagating in the z-direction and the permeability of free space is μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field, we can use the relationship between the electric field and the magnetic field in a plane wave propagating in free space. This relationship is given by:\n\nH(x, t) = (1/Z₀) * E(x, t)\n\nwhere H(x, t) is the magnetic field, E(x, t) is the electric field, and Z₀ is the impedance of free space. The impedance of free space is given by:\n\nZ₀ = √(μ₀/ε₀)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m) and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10⁻¹² F/m).\n\nFirst, we need to find the impedance of free space:\n\nZ₀ = √((4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m) / (8.854 × 10⁻¹² F/m)) ≈ 376.73 Ω\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field:\n\nH(x, t) = (1/376.73) * cos(2π(10^9)x - 2π(10^9)t) A/m\n\nH(x, t) ≈ 2.656 × 10⁻³ * cos(2π(10^9)x - 2π(10^9)t) A/m\n\nSo, the corresponding magnetic field of the wave is:\n\nH(x, t) ≈ 2.656 × 10⁻³ * cos(2π(10^9)x - 2π(10^9)t) A/m"
