    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The length of a Hilbert curve increases with each order. In general, the length of a Hilbert curve of order n, assuming each square has a side length of 1 unit, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = 2^n + (2^n - 1)\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, we have:\n\nLength = 2^3 + (2^3 - 1) = 8 + 7 = 15 units"
