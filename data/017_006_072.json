    "message_2": "To show that either G is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 77 = 7 * 11, where 7 and 11 are distinct prime numbers.\n\nBy the first Sylow theorem, there exist Sylow p-subgroups for both 7 and 11 in G.\n\nLet P_7 be a Sylow 7-subgroup of G, and P_11 be a Sylow 11-subgroup of G. Then, |P_7| = 7 and |P_11| = 11.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus, n_7 divides 11 and n_7 = 1 or 11. Similarly, the number of Sylow 11-subgroups, n_11, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 11. Thus, n_11 divides 7 and n_11 = 1 or 7.\n\nIf n_7 = n_11 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup and a unique Sylow 11-subgroup in G. Since these subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Let P_7 = <a> and P_11 = <b>, where a has order 7 and b has order 11.\n\nNow, consider the element ab in G. Since P_7 and P_11 are normal, (ab)^7 = a^7b^7 = e, and (ab)^11 = a^11b^11 = e. Thus, the order of ab divides both 7 and 11, which are prime numbers. Therefore, the order of ab is 1, which means ab = e. This implies that G is the direct product of P_7 and P_11, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11.\n\nIf n_7 = 11 and n_11 = 7, then there are 11 Sylow 7-subgroups and 7 Sylow 11-subgroups. However, this case is not possible because the total number of elements in G would exceed 77. To see this, note that each Sylow 7-subgroup has 6 non-identity elements, and each Sylow 11-subgroup has 10 non-identity elements. If we assume that these subgroups are distinct, then there would be at least 11 * 6 + 7 * 10 = 106 non-identity elements in G, which is a contradiction since |G| = 77.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11."
