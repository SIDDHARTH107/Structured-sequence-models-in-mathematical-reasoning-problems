    "message_1": "A soft drink company claims that their newly designed can retains fizz for more than 3.5 hours. In a sample of 50 cans, the mean fizz time is found to be 3.6 hours with a standard deviation of 0.3 hours. \nQuestion: Is there enough evidence to support the company's claim? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean fizz time is equal to 3.5 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean fizz time is greater than 3.5 hours.\n\nH0: μ = 3.5 hours\nH1: μ > 3.5 hours\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 3.6 hours\nSample standard deviation (s) = 0.3 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (3.6 - 3.5) / (0.3 / √50)\nt = 0.1 / (0.3 / 7.071)\nt = 0.1 / 0.0424\nt ≈ 2.36\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ 1.68\n\nSince the calculated t-score (2.36) is greater than the critical t-value (1.68), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is enough evidence at a 0.05 significance level to support the company's claim that their newly designed can retains fizz for more than 3.5 hours."
