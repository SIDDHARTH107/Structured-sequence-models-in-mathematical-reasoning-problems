    "message_2": "Yes, the graph G contains a Hamiltonian cycle. A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every node (vertex) is visited exactly once.\n\nOne example of a Hamiltonian cycle in this graph is:\n\nA --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> A\n\nThis cycle visits all vertices exactly once and returns to the starting vertex A, forming a closed loop."
