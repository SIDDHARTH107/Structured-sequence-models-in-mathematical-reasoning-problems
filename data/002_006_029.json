    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nFor a circle with a radius of 5 cm, the circumference is:\n\nC = 2π(5)\nC = 10π\n\nThe exact circumference is 10π cm. If you want an approximate value, you can use the value of π as 3.14159:\n\nC ≈ 10 × 3.14159\nC ≈ 31.4159 cm"
