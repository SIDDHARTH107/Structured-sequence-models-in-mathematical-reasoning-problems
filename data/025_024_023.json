    "message_2": "To find the fixed points of the action, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ on the curve $C$ such that $(-x, -y) = (x, y)$. This means that $x = -x$ and $y = -y$. Since we are working in $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, this means that $2x = 0$ and $2y = 0$. In $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, the only element that satisfies this is $0$. So, we have $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.\n\nNow, we need to check if the point $(0, 0)$ lies on the curve $C$. Plugging in $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the equation of the curve, we get:\n\n$0^2 = 0^3 + 4(0) + 1 \\Rightarrow 0 = 1$\n\nSince this is not true, the point $(0, 0)$ does not lie on the curve $C$. Therefore, there are no fixed points of the action of $G$ on $C$. The answer is $\\boxed{0}$."
