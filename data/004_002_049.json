    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 12x + 7) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1, we can try to simplify the function first. We can factor the numerator:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 7 = 3(x^2 - 4x + 7/3)\n\nNow, let's try to find a factor of the form (x - 1) in the expression x^2 - 4x + 7/3. We can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. In this case, let's use synthetic division:\n\n```\n1 |  1  -4  7/3\n    |     1  -3\n  -----------\n      1  -3  4/3\n```\n\nSo, the division gives us the quotient x - 3 and the remainder 4/3. Therefore, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = (3x^2 - 12x + 7) / (x - 1) = 3(x - 3) + 4/3\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 1:\n\nlim (x -> 1) f(x) = lim (x -> 1) [3(x - 3) + 4/3]\n\n= 3(1 - 3) + 4/3\n\n= 3(-2) + 4/3\n\n= -6 + 4/3\n\n= -18/3 + 4/3\n\n= (-18 + 4) / 3\n\n= -14/3\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 12x + 7) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1 is -14/3."
