    "message_2": "Let's denote the angles as A, B, and C, and the sides opposite to them as a, b, and c, respectively. According to the problem, we have:\n\nAngle A = 45 degrees\nAngle B = 60 degrees\nSide a = 5 cm\nSide b = 7 cm\n\nFirst, we need to find angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can calculate angle C as follows:\n\nAngle C = 180 - (Angle A + Angle B)\nAngle C = 180 - (45 + 60)\nAngle C = 180 - 105\nAngle C = 75 degrees\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side c:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe can use the known values of a, A, b, and B to find c:\n\n5/sin(45) = 7/sin(60) = c/sin(75)\n\nWe can solve for c by multiplying both sides of the equation by sin(75):\n\nc = 7/sin(60) * sin(75)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of sin(60) and sin(75):\n\nc = 7 * (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))/4\n\nc = 7 * (sqrt(3) * (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2)))/8\n\nc ≈ 7 * (1.732 * (2.449 + 1.414))/8\n\nc ≈ 7 * (1.732 * 3.863)/8\n\nc ≈ 7 * 6.685/8\n\nc ≈ 46.795/8\n\nc ≈ 5.849 cm\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite angle C is approximately 5.849 cm."
