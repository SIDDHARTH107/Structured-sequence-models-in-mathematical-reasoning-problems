    "message_2": "The given Schrödinger equation is a special case of the more general Hermite equation, which has solutions in terms of Hermite functions. For the given equation, we can write the solutions in terms of Hermite polynomials and Gaussian functions.\n\nLet's first introduce a dimensionless variable $$\\xi = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2}{E}}x$$ and rewrite the Schrödinger equation in terms of this new variable:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2 \\psi}{d\\xi^2} - \\xi^2 \\psi = -\\frac{1}{2}\\psi$$\n\nNow, the two linearly independent solutions of the above equation can be written as:\n\n$$\\psi_1(\\xi) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\xi^2} H_n(\\xi)$$\n$$\\psi_2(\\xi) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\xi^2} H_{n+1}(\\xi)$$\n\nwhere $H_n(\\xi)$ and $H_{n+1}(\\xi)$ are the Hermite polynomials of order $n$ and $n+1$, respectively. These polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the weight function $e^{-\\xi^2}$, which ensures that the solutions are square-integrable over the whole real line.\n\nTo find the corresponding solutions in terms of the original variable $x$, we can substitute back $\\xi = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2}{E}}x$:\n\n$$\\psi_1(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2}{E}}x\\right)^2} H_n\\left(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2}{E}}x\\right)$$\n$$\\psi_2(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2}{E}}x\\right)^2} H_{n+1}\\left(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2}{E}}x\\right)$$\n\nThese are the two linearly independent solutions of the given Schrödinger equation that are square-integrable over the whole real line."
