    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and the lengths of its parallel sides are 10 cm and 15 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides have lengths of 10 cm and 15 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 15) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * 25 * 8\nArea = 12.5 * 8\nArea = 100 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 100 square centimeters."
