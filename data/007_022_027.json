    "message_2": "1. To calculate the number of points on the elliptic curve over the field Fp, we will use the formula:\n\nN = 1 + p - a_p\n\nwhere N is the number of points, p is the prime number (17 in this case), and a_p is the trace of Frobenius, which can be calculated using the Hasse's theorem:\n\n|a_p| <= 2 * sqrt(p)\n\nWe will now find the points on the curve and count them:\n\nFor each x in Fp, we will calculate the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 + 2x + 2) and check if it is a quadratic residue (i.e., if there exists a y in Fp such that y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2).\n\nPoints on the curve:\n(0, 6), (0, 11)\n(1, 9), (1, 8)\n(2, 5), (2, 12)\n(3, 10), (3, 7)\n(4, 3), (4, 14)\n(5, 1), (5, 16)\n(6, 3), (6, 14)\n(7, 6), (7, 11)\n(8, 7), (8, 10)\n(9, 7), (9, 10)\n(10, 6), (10, 11)\n(11, 5), (11, 12)\n(12, 16), (12, 1)\n(13, 7), (13, 10)\n(14, 6), (14, 11)\n(15, 2), (15, 15)\n(16, 4), (16, 13)\n\nThere are 34 points, including the point at infinity. So, N = 34.\n\n2. To find a point G on the curve with the maximum possible order, we will use the fact that the order of a point divides the number of points on the curve (N). The divisors of N = 34 are 1, 2, 17, and 34. We are looking for a point with order greater than or equal to p (17).\n\nLet's check the orders of some points on the curve:\n\nOrder of (1, 9) is 34.\nOrder of (1, 8) is 34.\nOrder of (2, 5) is 34.\nOrder of (2, 12) is 34.\n\nWe can see that the points (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 5), and (2, 12) have order 34, which is greater than or equal to p (17). We can choose any of these points as G. For example, let G = (1, 9).\n\n3. Given a point P on the curve, we will compute 10P using the double-and-add algorithm. Let's assume P = (1, 9).\n\nThe double-and-add algorithm works as follows:\n1. Write the binary representation of the scalar (10 in this case): 10 = 1010.\n2. Initialize the result R to the point at infinity (O).\n3. Iterate through the binary representation from left to right:\n   a. Double the current value of R.\n   b. If the current bit is 1, add P to R.\n\nApplying the double-and-add algorithm for 10P:\n\nR = O\n1st bit (1): R = 2R + P = O + P = P = (1, 9)\n2nd bit (0): R = 2R = 2P = (6, 3)\n3rd bit (1): R = 2R + P = 4P + P = 5P = (16, 4)\n4th bit (0): R = 2R = 10P = (13, 10)\n\nSo, 10P = (13, 10)."
