    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph.\n\nWe can start at vertex A and try to traverse the graph:\n\n1. Start at vertex A.\n2. Move to vertex B.\n3. Move to vertex C.\n4. Move to vertex D.\n5. Move to vertex E.\n6. Move to vertex F.\n\nNow, we have visited all vertices exactly once, but we cannot return to vertex A from vertex F, as there is no edge connecting them. Therefore, there is no Hamiltonian cycle in this graph."
