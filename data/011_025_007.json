    "message_2": "In a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, there are a total of 9 cells on the board. Since each player takes turns making a move, the maximum number of moves that can be made in a game is 9. However, if both players play optimally, the game will usually end in a draw after fewer moves. In an optimally played game, the maximum number of moves is 9, but the game will typically end in a draw after 8 or fewer moves."
