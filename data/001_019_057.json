    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |5x-8| = 12, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero, i.e., 5x - 8 â‰¥ 0.\nIn this case, we can remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n\n5x - 8 = 12\n5x = 20\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative, i.e., 5x - 8 < 0.\nIn this case, we can remove the absolute value sign and multiply the right side by -1:\n\n-(5x - 8) = 12\n-5x + 8 = 12\n-5x = 4\nx = -4/5\n\nSo, the solutions to the absolute value equation |5x-8| = 12 are x = 4 and x = -4/5."
