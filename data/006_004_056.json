    "message_1": "A game of chance involves spinning a spinner divided into 6 equal sections, numbered from 1 to 6. What is the probability of winning the game by landing on a number that is odd or a multiple of 3?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning the game by landing on a number that is odd or a multiple of 3, we first need to identify the numbers that meet these criteria. The odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5, and the multiples of 3 are 3 and 6. Combining these, we have the numbers 1, 3, 5, and 6 as the winning numbers.\n\nThere are 4 winning numbers out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of winning the game is:\n\nP(winning) = (number of winning outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = 4/6\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nP(winning) = 2/3\n\nSo the probability of winning the game by landing on a number that is odd or a multiple of 3 is 2/3 or approximately 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)."
