    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. In the given graph, we can find the maximum size of an independent set by selecting vertices that are not directly connected to each other.\n\nOne possible maximum independent set is {A, E, C}. Another possible maximum independent set is {B, D, F}. Both of these sets have 3 vertices, so the maximum size of an independent set in this graph is 3."
