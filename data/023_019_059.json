    "message_2": "To determine the impulse response of the system, we first need to find the inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function G(s). The transfer function is given by:\n\nG(s) = 10(s+3)/(s^2 + 4s + 13)\n\nWe can rewrite the denominator as a sum of squares:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 13 = (s + 2)^2 + 3^2\n\nNow, G(s) can be written as:\n\nG(s) = 10(s+3)/((s + 2)^2 + 3^2)\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use the following formula for the inverse Laplace transform of a function in the form of F(s) = K(s+a)/((s+a)^2 + w^2):\n\nL^-1{K(s+a)/((s+a)^2 + w^2)} = K * e^(-at) * sin(wt)/w\n\nApplying this formula to G(s):\n\ng(t) = L^-1{G(s)} = 10 * e^(-2t) * sin(3t)/3\n\nNow, we have the impulse response of the system:\n\ng(t) = (10/3) * e^(-2t) * sin(3t)\n\nTo analyze the stability of the system, we can look at the poles of the transfer function G(s). The poles are the roots of the denominator:\n\n(s + 2)^2 + 3^2 = 0\n\nThe poles are complex conjugates: s = -2 Â± 3i\n\nSince the real part of the poles is negative, the system is stable. The impulse response will decay over time due to the e^(-2t) term, and the system will not oscillate indefinitely."
