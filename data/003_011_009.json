    "message_1": "A tower that is 50 meters tall casts a shadow that is 30 meters long. If a person standing next to the tower casts a shadow that is 2 meters long, how far away is the person from the base of the tower? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using similar triangles. The ratio of the tower's height to its shadow length is the same as the ratio of the person's height to their shadow length.\n\nLet x be the height of the person. Then we have:\n\n50/30 = x/2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = (50 * 2) / 30\nx = 100 / 30\nx = 10/3 ≈ 3.33 meters\n\nNow we have the height of the person. We can use the same ratio to find the distance from the person to the base of the tower. Let y be the distance from the person to the base of the tower. Then we have:\n\n50/30 = 3.33/y\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = (3.33 * 30) / 50\ny = 99.9 / 50\ny ≈ 2 meters\n\nSo, the person is approximately 2 meters away from the base of the tower."
