    "message_1": "Here is a possible numerical problem for a math student to solve:\nSuppose that we have a 2-dimensional topological quantum field theory which assigns a vector space $V_\\Sigma$ to each closed oriented surface $\\Sigma$ and a linear map $Z_M$ to each closed oriented 3-manifold $M$. Suppose further that $V_T$ is the vector space associated to the torus $T$ and $Z_S$ is the linear map associated to the 3-sphere $S^3$ (which is known to be equal to the quantum dimension of $V_T$, i.e. $Z_S=\\mathrm{dim}(V_T)$).\n\nWhat is the value of $Z_{T\\times S^1}$, i.e. the linear map associated to the product $T\\times S^1$ of the torus and a circle? Express your answer in terms of the quantum dimensions of $V_T$ and $V_{\\overline{T}}$, the vector space associated to the mirror image $\\overline{T}$ of the torus.",
    "message_2": "To compute the value of $Z_{T\\times S^1}$, we can use the property of 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that the linear map associated to a disjoint union of manifolds is the tensor product of the linear maps associated to each manifold.\n\nFirst, let's consider the decomposition of $T\\times S^1$ as a disjoint union of two manifolds: $T$ and $\\overline{T}$, where $\\overline{T}$ is the mirror image of the torus. This can be done by cutting $T\\times S^1$ along a torus that is a copy of $T$ and its mirror image $\\overline{T}$, and then gluing them back together along their boundaries.\n\nNow, we can use the property of TQFTs mentioned above to compute the linear map associated to $T\\times S^1$ as the tensor product of the linear maps associated to $T$ and $\\overline{T}$:\n\n$$Z_{T\\times S^1} = Z_T \\otimes Z_{\\overline{T}}$$\n\nSince $Z_T$ is a linear map from $V_T$ to $V_{S^3}$ and $Z_{\\overline{T}}$ is a linear map from $V_{\\overline{T}}$ to $V_{S^3}$, the tensor product $Z_T \\otimes Z_{\\overline{T}}$ is a linear map from $V_T \\otimes V_{\\overline{T}}$ to $V_{S^3} \\otimes V_{S^3}$.\n\nNow, we know that $Z_S = \\mathrm{dim}(V_T)$ and $Z_S = \\mathrm{dim}(V_{\\overline{T}})$, so we can express the value of $Z_{T\\times S^1}$ in terms of the quantum dimensions of $V_T$ and $V_{\\overline{T}}$:\n\n$$Z_{T\\times S^1} = \\mathrm{dim}(V_T) \\cdot \\mathrm{dim}(V_{\\overline{T}})$$\n\nThis is the value of the linear map associated to the product $T\\times S^1$ of the torus and a circle in terms of the quantum dimensions of $V_T$ and $V_{\\overline{T}}$."
