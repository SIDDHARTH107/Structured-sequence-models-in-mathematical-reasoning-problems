    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we can use the definitions of the trigonometric functions:\n\ntan(θ) = sin(θ) / cos(θ)\nsec(θ) = 1 / cos(θ)\n\nNow, substitute these definitions into the expression:\n\ntan(θ) * sec(θ) - cos(θ) = (sin(θ) / cos(θ)) * (1 / cos(θ)) - cos(θ)\n\nSimplify the expression by multiplying the fractions:\n\n(sin(θ) / cos²(θ)) - cos(θ)\n\nNow, let's find the value of the expression when θ = π/4:\n\nsin(π/4) = √2 / 2\ncos(π/4) = √2 / 2\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression:\n\n(sin(π/4) / cos²(π/4)) - cos(π/4) = ((√2 / 2) / (√2 / 2)²) - (√2 / 2)\n\nCalculate the squared cosine:\n\n(√2 / 2)² = (2 / 4) = 1/2\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the expression:\n\n((√2 / 2) / (1/2)) - (√2 / 2)\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal:\n\n(√2 / 2) * (2/1) - (√2 / 2) = √2 - (√2 / 2)\n\nNow, find a common denominator to combine the terms:\n\n(2√2 / 2) - (√2 / 2) = (2√2 - √2) / 2\n\nFactor out the common factor of √2:\n\n√2(2 - 1) / 2 = √2 / 2\n\nSo, the simplified expression is √2 / 2 when θ = π/4."
