    "message_2": "To find the corresponding public key y for ElGamal encryption, we use the formula:\n\ny = g^x mod p\n\nwhere x is the private key, g is the generator, and p is the prime number.\n\nIn this case, x = 7, g = 5, and p = 23. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = 5^7 mod 23\n\nCalculating the result:\n\ny = 78125 mod 23\ny = 17\n\nSo, the corresponding public key y is 17."
