    "message_1": "The transposition cipher is created by rearranging the letters of a message. Suppose you have a message \"HELLO WORLD\" and you want to encrypt it using a transposition cipher by rearranging the letters in the following pattern:\n\nH _ L _ O _ W _ R _\nE _ D _ L _ O _\n\nWhat is the order of the encrypted message after applying the above transposition pattern?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the given transposition pattern, we place the letters in the pattern as follows:\n\nH _ L _ O _ W _ R _\nE _ D _ L _ O _\n\nNow, we read the message column-wise:\n\nH E L D L O L O W R O\n\nSo, the order of the encrypted message after applying the transposition pattern is \"HELDLOLOWRO\"."
