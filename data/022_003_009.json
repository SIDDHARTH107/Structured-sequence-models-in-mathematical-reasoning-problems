    "message_2": "To evaluate the contour integral ∮C (z^2 + 1) dz using Cauchy's theorem, we first need to check if the function f(z) = z^2 + 1 is analytic inside and on the contour C. Since f(z) is a polynomial, it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane.\n\nNow, we need to find the singularities of f(z) inside the contour C. The function f(z) has two singularities, which are the roots of the equation z^2 + 1 = 0. These roots are z = ±i. Both of these singularities lie inside the unit circle C.\n\nHowever, Cauchy's theorem states that the contour integral of an analytic function over a simple closed curve is zero. Since f(z) = z^2 + 1 is analytic everywhere, including inside and on the contour C, we can apply Cauchy's theorem.\n\nTherefore, the contour integral ∮C (z^2 + 1) dz = 0."
