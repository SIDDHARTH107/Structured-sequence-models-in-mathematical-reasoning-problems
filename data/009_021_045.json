    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 4X''(x)T(t) - 3X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4X(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x) - 3/4\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x only, they must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ + 3/4\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) T'(t) = -λT(t)\n2) X''(x) = (-λ + 3/4)X(x)\n\nSolve the second ODE for X(x):\n\nX''(x) + (λ - 3/4)X(x) = 0\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0. The eigenvalues λ and eigenfunctions X(x) can be found as:\n\nλ_n = (2n - 1)^2 * π^2 / 4, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\nX_n(x) = sin((2n - 1)πx / 2)\n\nNow, solve the first ODE for T(t):\n\nT'(t) = -λT(t)\n\nT_n(t) = exp(-λ_n t)\n\nThe general solution is a sum of the product of eigenfunctions and time-dependent functions:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [C_n * sin((2n - 1)πx / 2) * exp(-λ_n t)]\n\nNow, apply the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(πx / 2):\n\nsin(πx / 2) = Σ [C_n * sin((2n - 1)πx / 2)]\n\nComparing the terms, we can see that C_1 = 1 and all other coefficients C_n = 0 for n > 1.\n\nSo, the final solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = sin(πx / 2) * exp(-π^2 * t / 4)"
