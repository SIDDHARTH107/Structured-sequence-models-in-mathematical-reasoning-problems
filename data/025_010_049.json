    "message_2": "To find the degree, arithmetic genus, and geometric genus of the curve $C$, we first need to find the degree of the curve. The degree of a projective plane curve is the highest degree of the monomials in its defining equation. In this case, the equation is $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-2z)$. Expanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\n$x^3 - 3x^2z + 2xz^2 = y^2z$.\n\nThe highest degree of the monomials in this equation is 3, so the degree of the curve $C$ is 3.\n\nNext, we need to find the arithmetic genus of the curve. The arithmetic genus of a projective plane curve of degree $d$ is given by the formula:\n\n$g_a = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$.\n\nIn our case, $d = 3$, so the arithmetic genus is:\n\n$g_a = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nNow, we need to find the geometric genus of the curve. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a curve of degree $d$ and arithmetic genus $g_a$, the geometric genus $g$ is given by:\n\n$g = g_a - \\delta$,\n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the number of singular points of the curve. To find the singular points, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the curve's equation with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (y^2z - x^3 + 3x^2z - 2xz^2) = -3x^2 + 6xz - 2z^2$,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (y^2z - x^3 + 3x^2z - 2xz^2) = 2yz$,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (y^2z - x^3 + 3x^2z - 2xz^2) = y^2 + 3x^2 - 4xz$.\n\nA singular point is a point where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero. From the second equation, we see that either $y = 0$ or $z = 0$. If $y = 0$, then the third equation becomes $z(3x^2 - 4xz) = 0$, which implies either $z = 0$ or $x = \\frac{3}{4}z$. If $z = 0$, then the first equation becomes $-3x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. So, one singular point is $(0, 0, 0)$, but this point is not in the projective plane. If $x = \\frac{3}{4}z$, then the first equation becomes $-\\frac{9}{16}z^2 = 0$, which implies $z = 0$. This case leads to no singular points.\n\nNow, consider the case when $z = 0$. The first equation becomes $-3x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. The third equation becomes $y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So, we have another singular point $(0, 0, 0)$, but again, this point is not in the projective plane.\n\nSince there are no singular points, $\\delta = 0$, and the geometric genus is equal to the arithmetic genus:\n\n$g = g_a - \\delta = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n\nIn summary, the degree of the curve $C$ is 3, the arithmetic genus is 1, and the geometric genus is 1."
