    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on any given day\n- n is the total number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 7 (days)\n- k = 2 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.4 (probability of rain on any given day)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(7, 2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 rainy days out of 7 days:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!)\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!)\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / (2 * 120)\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / 240\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(7, 2) * p^2 * (1-p)^(7-2)\nP(X = 2) = 21 * (0.4)^2 * (0.6)^5\nP(X = 2) = 21 * 0.16 * 0.07776\nP(X = 2) â‰ˆ 0.261\n\nSo, the probability of it raining exactly 2 days during the next 7 days is approximately 0.261 or 26.1%."
