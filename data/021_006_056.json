    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the finite element method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain.\n2. Define the basis functions.\n3. Formulate the weak form of the problem.\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector.\n5. Apply boundary conditions.\n6. Solve the linear system.\n\nStep 1: Discretize the domain\n\nWe will use a uniform mesh of 10 elements to discretize the domain $[0,1]$. The mesh size is $h = \\frac{1-0}{10} = 0.1$. The nodes are $x_i = i \\cdot h$ for $i = 0,1,\\dots,10$.\n\nStep 2: Define the basis functions\n\nWe will use linear basis functions, which are defined as:\n\n$$\\phi_i(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x-x_{i-1}}{h} & \\text{if } x \\in [x_{i-1}, x_i], \\\\\n\\frac{x_{i+1}-x}{h} & \\text{if } x \\in [x_i, x_{i+1}], \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nStep 3: Formulate the weak form of the problem\n\nWe multiply the given differential equation by a test function $v(x)$ and integrate over the domain:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\left( k(x) \\frac{d^2u(x)}{dx^2} + f(x) \\right) v(x) dx = 0.$$\n\nIntegration by parts gives:\n\n$$-\\int_0^1 k(x) \\frac{du(x)}{dx} \\frac{dv(x)}{dx} dx + \\left[ k(x) \\frac{du(x)}{dx} v(x) \\right]_0^1 = \\int_0^1 f(x) v(x) dx.$$\n\nStep 4: Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\n\nWe approximate the solution $u(x)$ as a linear combination of basis functions:\n\n$$u(x) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{10} u_i \\phi_i(x).$$\n\nSubstitute this approximation into the weak form and use the basis functions as test functions:\n\n$$-\\int_0^1 k(x) \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{10} u_i \\phi_i(x) \\right) \\frac{d\\phi_j(x)}{dx} dx = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\phi_j(x) dx, \\quad j = 1, \\dots, 10.$$\n\nThis leads to a system of linear equations $KU = F$, where $K$ is the global stiffness matrix, $U$ is the vector of unknown coefficients, and $F$ is the load vector.\n\nStep 5: Apply boundary conditions\n\nWe have Dirichlet boundary conditions: $u(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 1$. We can enforce these conditions by setting $u_1 = 0$ and $u_{10} = 1$.\n\nStep 6: Solve the linear system\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations with 8 unknowns ($u_2, u_3, \\dots, u_9$). We can solve this system using any standard linear solver (e.g., Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, etc.) to obtain the coefficients $u_i$.\n\nFinally, we can approximate the solution $u(x)$ as:\n\n$$u(x) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{10} u_i \\phi_i(x).$$"
