    "message_1": "Suppose that the heights of adult men in a certain population are normally distributed with a mean of 68 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If a man is chosen at random from this population, what is the probability that he is between 64 and 70 inches tall?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a man is between 64 and 70 inches tall, we will use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we will find the z-scores for 64 and 70 inches:\n\nz1 = (64 - 68) / 3 = -4/3 ≈ -1.33\nz2 = (70 - 68) / 3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.67\n\nNow, we will look up the z-scores in the standard normal distribution table (or use a calculator or software that provides the values) to find the probabilities:\n\nP(z1) = P(z = -1.33) ≈ 0.092\nP(z2) = P(z = 0.67) ≈ 0.748\n\nTo find the probability that a man is between 64 and 70 inches tall, we will subtract the probabilities:\n\nP(64 < X < 70) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.748 - 0.092 = 0.656\n\nSo, the probability that a man chosen at random from this population is between 64 and 70 inches tall is approximately 0.656 or 65.6%."
