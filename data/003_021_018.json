    "message_2": "To find the angle between the vectors u and v, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu · v = (3 * -2) + (4 * 6) = -6 + 24 = 18\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v| = √((-2)² + 6²) = √(4 + 36) = √40 = 2√10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n18 = 5 * 2√10 * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 * 2√10:\n\ncos(θ) = 18 / (10√10)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(18 / (10√10))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 33.56°\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the vectors u and v is approximately 34°."
