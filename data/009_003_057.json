    "message_1": "Consider a thin metal plate with dimensions $2$ cm x $3$ cm initially at a temperature of $100$ degrees Celsius. If the edges are kept at a constant temperature of $50$ degrees Celsius and the diffusion coefficient for the plate is $0.01$ cm$^2$/min, find the temperature distribution of the plate after $10$ minutes. Assume that the plate is thin enough so that the temperature at any point within the plate is the same throughout the thickness.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the plate after 10 minutes, we can use the 2D heat equation, which is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = D(\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2})$$\n\nwhere $T(x, y, t)$ is the temperature distribution, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $x$ and $y$ are the spatial coordinates.\n\nWe can solve this equation using separation of variables. Let $T(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)Y(y)\\frac{dT}{dt} = D(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)$$\n\nDividing both sides by $DXYT$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{D}\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n$$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n$$Y(y) = C\\cos(\\lambda y) + D\\sin(\\lambda y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for the edges being at a constant temperature of 50 degrees Celsius, we get:\n\n$$X(0) = A\\cos(0) = 50$$\n$$X(2) = A\\cos(2\\lambda) = 50$$\n$$Y(0) = C\\cos(0) = 50$$\n$$Y(3) = C\\cos(3\\lambda) = 50$$\n\nFrom the first and third equations, we get $A = C = 50$. The second and fourth equations give us:\n\n$$50\\cos(2\\lambda) = 50$$\n$$50\\cos(3\\lambda) = 50$$\n\nThese equations imply that $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. Thus, the general solution for the temperature distribution is:\n\n$$T(x, y, t) = 50 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\sin(n\\pi y)e^{-n^2\\pi^2 Dt}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition $T(x, y, 0) = 100$. This gives us:\n\n$$100 = 50 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\sin(n\\pi y)$$\n\nSolving for $A_n$, we get:\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{4}{n\\pi}\\int_0^2\\int_0^3 (100 - 50)\\sin(n\\pi x)\\sin(n\\pi y) dy dx$$\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution after 10 minutes:\n\n$$T(x, y, 10) = 50 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\sin(n\\pi y)e^{-n^2\\pi^2 (0.01)(10)}$$\n\nThis is the temperature distribution of the plate after 10 minutes. Note that this is an infinite series, so to get an accurate approximation, you can sum up the first few terms."
