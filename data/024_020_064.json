    "message_2": "To determine the Hopf map of the manifold M at the point (1,0,0,0), we simply need to plug the coordinates of this point into the Hopf map function π(x1, x2, x3, x4).\n\nGiven the point (1,0,0,0), we have x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 0, and x4 = 0. Now, we can plug these values into the Hopf map function:\n\nπ(1, 0, 0, 0) = (2(1)(0) + 2(0)(0), 2(0)(0) - 2(1)(0), (1)^2 - (0)^2 + (0)^2 - (0)^2)\n\nπ(1, 0, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 1)\n\nSo, the Hopf map of the manifold M at the point (1,0,0,0) is (0, 0, 1)."
