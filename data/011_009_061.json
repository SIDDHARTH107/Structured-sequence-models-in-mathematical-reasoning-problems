    "message_2": "To partition a set of n distinct elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number, which is denoted by B(n). The Bell number counts the number of different ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.\n\nFor a set of 5 distinct elements, we need to find B(5). The first few Bell numbers are:\n\nB(0) = 1, B(1) = 1, B(2) = 2, B(3) = 5, B(4) = 15, and B(5) = 52.\n\nSo, there are 52 ways to partition a set of 5 distinct elements into non-empty subsets."
