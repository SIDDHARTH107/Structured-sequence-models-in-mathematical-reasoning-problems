Report the coordinates of the centroid for each cluster.",
    "message_2": "To perform a k-means clustering, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the centroids randomly.\n2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n3. Update the centroids by calculating the mean of all the data points assigned to each centroid.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a certain number of iterations have been reached.\n\nLet's start by initializing the centroids randomly. We will use the first three data points as the initial centroids:\n\nCentroid 1: (25, 162)\nCentroid 2: (24, 169)\nCentroid 3: (26, 175)\n\nNow, we will assign each data point to the nearest centroid and update the centroids:\n\nIteration 1:\nCluster 1: (25, 162), (24, 169), (23, 165)\nCluster 2: (26, 175), (28, 170), (27, 172), (26, 171)\nCluster 3: (31, 182), (30, 178), (29, 176)\n\nUpdate centroids:\nCentroid 1: (24, 165.33)\nCentroid 2: (26.75, 172)\nCentroid 3: (30, 178.67)\n\nIteration 2:\nCluster 1: (25, 162), (24, 169), (23, 165)\nCluster 2: (26, 175), (28, 170), (27, 172), (26, 171)\nCluster 3: (31, 182), (30, 178), (29, 176)\n\nThe clusters have not changed, so we can stop the iterations here. The final centroids are:\n\nCentroid 1: (24, 165.33)\nCentroid 2: (26.75, 172)\nCentroid 3: (30, 178.67)\n\nSo, the coordinates of the centroids for the three clusters are (24, 165.33), (26.75, 172), and (30, 178.67)."
