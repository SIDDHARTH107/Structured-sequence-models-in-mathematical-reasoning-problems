    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall at an angle of 60 degrees. The bottom of the ladder is 6 feet away from the base of the wall. How long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "We can use the sine function to solve this problem. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder in this case). \n\nLet L be the length of the ladder. We have:\n\nsin(60°) = (opposite side) / L\n\nThe opposite side in this case is the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, which is 6 feet. The sine of 60 degrees is equal to √3/2. So we have:\n\n(√3/2) = 6 / L\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n\nL = 6 / ( √3/2)\n\nTo get rid of the fraction in the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\nL = (6 * 2) / √3\n\nNow, we can simplify:\n\nL = 12 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √3:\n\nL = (12 * √3) / ( √3 * √3)\n\nL = (12 * √3) / 3\n\nFinally, we can simplify:\n\nL = 4 * √3\n\nSo, the length of the ladder is 4√3 feet."
