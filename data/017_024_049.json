    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. \n\nNow, we will find the number of Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities for the number of subgroups: 1, 3, or 15. This is because the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide the order of the group (96) and must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. We will denote the number of 2-Sylow subgroups as n_2.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities for the number of subgroups: 1 or 4. This is because the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide the order of the group (96) and must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. We will denote the number of 3-Sylow subgroups as n_3.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: In this case, there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup and one 3-Sylow subgroup. This corresponds to the direct product of the two subgroups, which is a group of order 96. This gives us one non-isomorphic group.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup and four 3-Sylow subgroups. This gives us one non-isomorphic group.\n\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1: In this case, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups and one 3-Sylow subgroup. This gives us two non-isomorphic groups.\n\n4. n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1: In this case, there are fifteen 2-Sylow subgroups and one 3-Sylow subgroup. This gives us two non-isomorphic groups.\n\n5. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4: In this case, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. This gives us four non-isomorphic groups.\n\n6. n_2 = 15, n_3 = 4: In this case, there are fifteen 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. This gives us four non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 14 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
