    "message_2": "To find the complement of a set A, we need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nAssuming the universal set U is the set of integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now, we can find the complement of A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of U and A, we can see that the elements 7, 8, 9, and 10 are not in A. Therefore, the complement of A is:\n\nA' = {7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, to prove that the complement of A is unique, we need to show that there cannot be another set B' that is also the complement of A.\n\nAssume that there exists another set B' such that B' is also the complement of A. This means that B' contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since A' and B' both contain the same elements (all elements in U that are not in A), they must be equal.\n\nA' = B'\n\nThus, there can be only one complement of A, which is A' = {7, 8, 9, 10}. This proves that the complement of A is unique."
