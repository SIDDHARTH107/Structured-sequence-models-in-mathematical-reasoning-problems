The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = ∅ (empty set), because there are no common elements between the Cartesian product A × B and set B.\n\nNow, let's find B ∩ (A × B). The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nB ∩ (A × B) = ∅ (empty set), because there are no common elements between set B and the Cartesian product A × B.\n\nSince (A × B) ∩ B = ∅ and B ∩ (A × B) = ∅, we can see that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
