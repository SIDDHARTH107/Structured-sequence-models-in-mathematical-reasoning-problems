Prove that H is a normal subgroup of G and that G is isomorphic to either C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.",
    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 18 = 2 * 3^2. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. This means that n_3 can only be 1. Let P be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, which has order 9. Since there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, P must be normal in G.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H of order 6. Since the order of H is 2 * 3, H must contain an element of order 2 and an element of order 3. Let x be an element of order 2 in H and y be an element of order 3 in H. Then, the order of the element xy must be 6, as (xy)^3 = x^3y^3 = e and (xy)^2 â‰  e.\n\nSince the order of P is 9, there exists an element z in P with order 9. Now, we consider the conjugate of z by the element xy: (xy)z(xy)^{-1}. Since P is normal in G, this conjugate must also be in P. However, the order of the conjugate is the same as the order of z, which is 9. This implies that z and (xy)z(xy)^{-1} commute, as their orders are relatively prime.\n\nNow, we have (xy)z = z(xy). This implies that x(yz) = (yz)x. Since x has order 2, we have x^2 = e, and thus x = x^{-1}. Therefore, x(yz) = (yz)x implies that x(yz)x = yzx. Multiplying both sides by x on the right, we get x(yz) = yz^2x. This shows that x commutes with yz^2.\n\nSince x has order 2 and y has order 3, x and y commute with their powers. Thus, x commutes with yz^2, yz^4, yz^6, and yz^8. This implies that x commutes with all elements of the form yz^i, where i is an integer. Therefore, x commutes with all elements of the group generated by y and z, which is the entire group G.\n\nNow, we have shown that x commutes with all elements of G, which means that G is an abelian group. Since G is abelian, all of its subgroups, including H, are normal. Thus, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSince G is abelian and has order 18, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C18, C2 x C9, or C3 x C6. However, G has an element of order 6 (namely, xy), which means that G cannot be isomorphic to C2 x C9. Therefore, G is isomorphic to either C18 or C3 x C6."
