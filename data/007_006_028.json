    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 162 and 216 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (216) by the smaller number (162) and find the remainder.\n   216 รท 162 = 1 with a remainder of 54.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (216) with the smaller number (162) and the smaller number with the remainder (54) from the previous step.\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n\n   162 รท 54 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 54. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 162 and 216 is 54."
