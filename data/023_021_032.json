Then use this Fourier transform to solve for the electric field intensity, given the magnetic field intensity with the function g(x) = 2cos(2x) + 5sin(4x) over the same interval [0, 2π].",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = cos(2x) + 3sin(4x), we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n for the function. The Fourier series representation of a function is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a_0 / 2) + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients given by:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nFor f(x) = cos(2x) + 3sin(4x), we can see that a_2 = 1, b_4 = 3, and all other coefficients are zero. Therefore, the Fourier transform of f(x) is:\n\nF(ω) = π[δ(ω - 2) + 3δ(ω - 4)]\n\nNow, we are given the magnetic field intensity function g(x) = 2cos(2x) + 5sin(4x). We can see that a_2 = 2, b_4 = 5, and all other coefficients are zero. Therefore, the Fourier transform of g(x) is:\n\nG(ω) = π[2δ(ω - 2) + 5δ(ω - 4)]\n\nTo find the electric field intensity, we need to use the relationship between the electric and magnetic field intensities in the frequency domain:\n\nE(ω) = (1 / ω) * H(ω)\n\nwhere E(ω) is the electric field intensity and H(ω) is the magnetic field intensity. We can substitute the Fourier transforms of f(x) and g(x) into this equation:\n\nF(ω) = (1 / ω) * G(ω)\n\nπ[δ(ω - 2) + 3δ(ω - 4)] = (1 / ω) * π[2δ(ω - 2) + 5δ(ω - 4)]\n\nNow, we can solve for the electric field intensity in the frequency domain:\n\nE(ω) = π[2/ω * δ(ω - 2) + 5/ω * δ(ω - 4)]\n\nTo find the electric field intensity in the time domain, we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of E(ω):\n\ne(x) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[E(ω) * e^(jωx) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\ne(x) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[π(2/ω * δ(ω - 2) + 5/ω * δ(ω - 4)) * e^(jωx) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nUsing the properties of the Dirac delta function, we can simplify the integral:\n\ne(x) = (1 / 2π) * [2 * e^(j2x) + 5/2 * e^(j4x)]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the complex exponential terms as trigonometric functions:\n\ne(x) = (1 / π) * [2 * cos(2x) + 5/2 * cos(4x)]\n\nSo, the electric field intensity e(x) is given by:\n\ne(x) = (1 / π) * [2 * cos(2x) + 5/2 * cos(4x)]"
