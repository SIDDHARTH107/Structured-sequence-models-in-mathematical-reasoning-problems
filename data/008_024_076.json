    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the elimination method, we first need to eliminate one of the variables. In this case, we can eliminate the y variable by making the coefficients of y in both equations the same.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n\n1) 2x + y = 7\n2) 4x + 2y = 14\n\nNotice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n1) 4x + 2y = 14\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(4x + 2y) - (4x + 2y) = 14 - 14\n0 = 0\n\nSince we get 0 = 0, this means that the two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations. To express the solutions, we can solve for y in terms of x from the first equation:\n\ny = 7 - 2x\n\nSo, the solutions to the system of linear equations are given by (x, 7 - 2x) for any value of x."
