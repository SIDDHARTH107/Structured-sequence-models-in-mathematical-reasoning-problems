    "message_1": "What is the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a network within a given hour if the network has experienced an average of 2 DDoS attacks per day in the last month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, DDoS attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (in this case, an hour).\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of DDoS attacks per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can divide the average number of attacks per day by 24:\n\nAverage attacks per hour (λ) = 2 attacks per day / 24 hours per day = 1/12 attacks per hour\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one DDoS attack occurring within a given hour. To do this, we can find the probability of zero attacks occurring and then subtract that from 1:\n\nP(at least 1 attack) = 1 - P(0 attacks)\n\nUsing the Poisson probability formula, we can find the probability of zero attacks:\n\nP(k attacks) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nFor k = 0:\n\nP(0 attacks) = (e^(-1/12) * (1/12)^0) / 0! = e^(-1/12)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one attack:\n\nP(at least 1 attack) = 1 - e^(-1/12)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(at least 1 attack) ≈ 1 - 0.9231 ≈ 0.0769\n\nSo, the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on the network within a given hour is approximately 7.69%."
