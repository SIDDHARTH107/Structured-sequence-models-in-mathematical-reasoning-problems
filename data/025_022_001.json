If we denote by Per(D) the category of perfect complexes on X whose cohomology sheaves are supported on D, then what is the dimension of the Ext-algebra Ext\\^*\\_{Per(D)}(E, E), where E is a perfect complex on X with bounded coherent cohomology?",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the Ext-algebra Ext^*_{Per(D)}(E, E), we can use the derived category of coherent sheaves on X, denoted by D^b(Coh(X)). Since X is a nonsingular projective variety, we have a well-behaved theory of coherent sheaves and their derived categories.\n\nFirst, note that the category Per(D) can be identified with the full subcategory of D^b(Coh(X)) consisting of complexes whose cohomology sheaves are supported on D. This is because a perfect complex on X with bounded coherent cohomology is precisely a complex in D^b(Coh(X)) with coherent cohomology sheaves.\n\nNow, let's compute the Ext-algebra Ext^*_{Per(D)}(E, E). By definition, this is the graded algebra given by\n\nExt^*_{Per(D)}(E, E) = ⊕_i Ext^i_{Per(D)}(E, E),\n\nwhere Ext^i_{Per(D)}(E, E) is the i-th graded piece, given by the space of morphisms in the derived category D^b(Coh(X)) from E to E[i], where E[i] denotes the i-th shift of E.\n\nSince Per(D) is a full subcategory of D^b(Coh(X)), we can compute the Ext groups using the ambient derived category:\n\nExt^i_{Per(D)}(E, E) = Hom_{D^b(Coh(X))}(E, E[i]).\n\nNow, we can use the Grothendieck spectral sequence to relate these Hom groups to the cohomology of X. The Grothendieck spectral sequence states that for a morphism of abelian categories f: A → B and objects M, N in A, there is a spectral sequence with\n\nE_2^{p, q} = R^p f_* (R^q Hom_A(M, N))\n\nconverging to R^{p+q} Hom_B(f(M), f(N)).\n\nIn our case, we can take A = D^b(Coh(X)), B = Vect(k), and f to be the global sections functor Γ: D^b(Coh(X)) → Vect(k). Then, we have\n\nE_2^{p, q} = R^p Γ (R^q Hom_{D^b(Coh(X))}(E, E)).\n\nSince X is a nonsingular projective variety, the global sections functor Γ has finite cohomological dimension, so the spectral sequence degenerates at the E_2 page. Therefore, we have\n\nExt^i_{Per(D)}(E, E) = ⊕_{p+q=i} R^p Γ (R^q Hom_{D^b(Coh(X))}(E, E)).\n\nTo compute the dimension of the Ext-algebra, we need to compute the dimensions of these cohomology groups. This can be done using Serre duality and the fact that the cohomology of a nonsingular projective variety is finite-dimensional. In particular, we have\n\ndim_k Ext^i_{Per(D)}(E, E) = dim_k ⊕_{p+q=i} R^p Γ (R^q Hom_{D^b(Coh(X))}(E, E)).\n\nFinally, the dimension of the Ext-algebra is given by the sum of these dimensions over all i:\n\ndim_k Ext^*_{Per(D)}(E, E) = ∑_i dim_k Ext^i_{Per(D)}(E, E).\n\nIn general, this dimension will depend on the specific variety X, the divisor D, and the perfect complex E."
