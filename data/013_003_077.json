    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, two players are offered a sum of money that they can split among themselves. Player A proposes a split, and Player B can either accept or reject the split. If B accepts the split, they each receive their respective shares of the money. If B rejects the split, neither player gets any money. \n\nSuppose Player A is offered a sum of $100 to split with Player B, and proposes a split of $70 for themselves and $30 for B. Calculate the expected payoffs for each player if B accepts the split and if B rejects the split.",
    "message_2": "If Player B accepts the split proposed by Player A, the expected payoffs for each player are as follows:\n\nPlayer A: $70\nPlayer B: $30\n\nIf Player B rejects the split, neither player gets any money, so the expected payoffs for each player are:\n\nPlayer A: $0\nPlayer B: $0"
