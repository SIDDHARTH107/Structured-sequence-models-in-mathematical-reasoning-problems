    "message_1": "A math student is given a vector bundle $E$ over a $2$-dimensional closed manifold $M$ whose total space is $\\mathbb{R}^4$. If the rank of this vector bundle is $2$, can the bundle have a non-zero vector field everywhere on $M$? If yes, give an example. If no, justify why.",
    "message_2": "No, the bundle cannot have a non-zero vector field everywhere on $M$.\n\nTo justify this, we can use the hairy ball theorem. The hairy ball theorem states that there is no continuous tangent vector field on an even-dimensional closed manifold that is non-zero everywhere. In our case, $M$ is a 2-dimensional closed manifold, and the rank of the vector bundle $E$ is 2, which means that the fibers of the bundle are 2-dimensional vector spaces.\n\nIf there were a non-zero vector field everywhere on $M$, it would give a continuous section of the vector bundle $E$ that is non-zero everywhere. This section would correspond to a continuous tangent vector field on $M$. However, this contradicts the hairy ball theorem, which states that such a continuous tangent vector field cannot exist on an even-dimensional closed manifold.\n\nTherefore, the vector bundle $E$ cannot have a non-zero vector field everywhere on $M$."
