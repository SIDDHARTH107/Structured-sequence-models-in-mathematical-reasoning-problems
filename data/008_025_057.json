    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the second equation to make it easier to compare with the first equation:\n\n3x - 6y = 15\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx - 2y = 5\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\nx + 2y = 5\nx - 2y = 5\n\nWe can see that both equations have the same left-hand side (x - 2y), but different right-hand sides (5 and 5). This means that the two equations are parallel and will never intersect. Therefore, this system of equations has no solutions."
