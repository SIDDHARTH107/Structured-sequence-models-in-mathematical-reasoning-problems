    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the circumference of a circle with radius r and curvature K is given by the formula:\n\nC = 2π sinh(r/√(-K))\n\nIn this case, the curvature K is -2 and the radius r is 5 units. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC = 2π sinh(5/√(-(-2)))\n\nC = 2π sinh(5/√2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of sinh(5/√2):\n\nsinh(5/√2) ≈ 6.132\n\nFinally, we can find the circumference:\n\nC = 2π * 6.132 ≈ 12.264π\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle in hyperbolic geometry with a radius of 5 units and a curvature of -2 is approximately 12.264π units."
