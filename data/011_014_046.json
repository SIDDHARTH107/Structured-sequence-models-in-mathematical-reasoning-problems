    "message_1": "How many ways can 5 people sit at a round table if two of them refuse to sit next to each other? (Assuming rotational symmetry, two seatings that can be obtained from each other by rotation are considered the same.)",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the total number of ways to seat the 5 people without any restrictions. Since the table is round and we are considering rotational symmetry, we can fix one person's position and arrange the remaining 4 people in 4! ways.\n\nTotal ways without restrictions = 4! = 24\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways in which the two people who refuse to sit next to each other (let's call them A and B) actually do sit next to each other. We can treat A and B as a single entity, so we have 4 entities to arrange around the table (A and B together, and the other 3 people). We can arrange these 4 entities in 3! ways. However, within the A-B entity, A and B can switch places, so we need to multiply by 2 to account for this.\n\nTotal ways with A and B together = 3! Ã— 2 = 12\n\nNow, to find the number of ways in which A and B do not sit next to each other, we subtract the number of ways they do sit together from the total number of ways without restrictions.\n\nTotal ways with A and B not together = Total ways without restrictions - Total ways with A and B together\n= 24 - 12\n= 12\n\nSo, there are 12 ways for the 5 people to sit at the round table with A and B not sitting next to each other."
