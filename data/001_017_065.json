    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+3) - log(x) = 1.5, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog((x+3)/x) = 1.5\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property 10^log(a) = a. Applying this property to both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n10^(log((x+3)/x)) = 10^1.5\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n(x+3)/x = 10^1.5\n\nNow, we can solve for x. First, multiply both sides by x to get rid of the fraction:\n\nx+3 = x * 10^1.5\n\nNow, subtract x from both sides:\n\n3 = x * (10^1.5 - 1)\n\nNow, divide both sides by (10^1.5 - 1):\n\nx = 3 / (10^1.5 - 1)\n\nCalculating the value of 10^1.5:\n\n10^1.5 ≈ 31.62\n\nNow, substituting this value back into the equation:\n\nx = 3 / (31.62 - 1)\n\nx = 3 / 30.62\n\nx ≈ 0.098\n\nSo, the value of x is approximately 0.098."
