    "message_2": "The total Chern class of a complex manifold X is given by the formal sum:\n\nc(X) = 1 + c1(X) + c2(X) + c3(X) + ...\n\nIn this case, we are given the Chern classes c1(X) = 0, c2(X) = 2, and c3(X) = 5. Since X is a complex manifold of dimension 3, we only need to consider the first four terms in the total Chern class. Therefore, the total Chern class of X is:\n\nc(X) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8."
