    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer x such that:\n\n2^x ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n\nWe can start by calculating the powers of 2 modulo 17:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n2^4 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n2^5 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n2^6 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n\nWe found that 2^6 ≡ 13 (mod 17). Therefore, the smallest positive integer x is 6."
