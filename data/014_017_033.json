    "message_1": "In a message encrypted using a Caesar cipher, the letter \"C\" appears 28 times out of a total of 400 letters. What is the key (the shift used to encrypt the message)?",
    "message_2": "To determine the key (shift) used in the Caesar cipher, we need to analyze the frequency of the letter \"C\" in the encrypted message. In a typical English text, the most common letter is \"E.\" Since \"C\" appears to be the most frequent letter in the encrypted message, we can assume that \"C\" was shifted to replace \"E\" during the encryption process.\n\nTo find the key, we need to determine the shift between \"C\" and \"E.\" In the alphabet, \"C\" is the 3rd letter, and \"E\" is the 5th letter. The shift between them is 2 letters (5 - 3 = 2). Therefore, the key (shift) used in the Caesar cipher is 2."
