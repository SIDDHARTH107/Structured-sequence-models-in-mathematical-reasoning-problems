    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the first iteration, the perimeter is 2 units (two sides of the initial square).\nFor the second iteration, the perimeter is 4 units (each side of the first iteration is divided into two equal parts).\nFor the third iteration, the perimeter is 8 units (each side of the second iteration is divided into two equal parts).\n\nFor the fourth iteration, each side of the third iteration is divided into two equal parts, so the perimeter doubles again. Therefore, the perimeter of the fourth iteration of the Heighway dragon curve with an initial square side length of 1 unit is 16 units."
