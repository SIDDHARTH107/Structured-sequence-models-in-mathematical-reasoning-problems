    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nFor a circle with a radius of 7 cm, the circumference is:\n\nC = 2π(7)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14 × 7\nC ≈ 43.96 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 43.96 cm when rounded to two decimal places."
