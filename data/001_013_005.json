    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(x+7))^2 = 5^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + 7 = 25\n\nNow, we just need to isolate x by subtracting 7 from both sides:\n\nx = 25 - 7\n\nx = 18\n\nSo, the solution is x = 18."
