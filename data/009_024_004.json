    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions, which are given by:\n\n∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y = 0 (Continuity equation)\n\nρ(∂u/∂t + u∂u/∂x + v∂u/∂y) = -∂p/∂x + μ(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²) (x-momentum equation)\n\nρ(∂v/∂t + u∂v/∂x + v∂v/∂y) = -∂p/∂y + μ(∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y²) (y-momentum equation)\n\nGiven the initial and boundary conditions, we can simplify these equations. Since the fluid is at rest initially, and the boundary conditions have no time dependence, we can assume a steady-state solution. This means that ∂u/∂t = 0 and ∂v/∂t = 0. Also, since there is no flow in the y-direction, we can assume that v = 0 and ∂v/∂y = 0. \n\nThe continuity equation becomes:\n\n∂u/∂x = 0\n\nThis implies that u is not a function of x. \n\nThe x-momentum equation becomes:\n\nρu∂u/∂x = -∂p/∂x + μ(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nSince u is not a function of x, we have ∂u/∂x = 0, and the equation simplifies to:\n\n-∂p/∂x + μ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nWe are given that ∂p/∂x = 2 Pa/m, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nμ∂²u/∂y² = 2\n\nIntegrating twice with respect to y, we get:\n\nu(y) = (2/μ)y²/2 + C₁y + C₂\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0, y) = 0 and u(L, y) = 0, we find that C₂ = 0 and C₁ = -2H/μ. Thus, the velocity component u(x, y) is given by:\n\nu(x, y) = (2/μ)(yH - y²/2)\n\nSince v = 0, we have the velocity field:\n\nu(x, y) = (2/μ)(yH - y²/2)\nv(x, y) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the pressure field p(x, y). We can use the x-momentum equation:\n\n-∂p/∂x + μ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nTaking the second derivative of u with respect to y, we get:\n\n∂²u/∂y² = -2/μ\n\nSubstituting this into the x-momentum equation, we get:\n\n-∂p/∂x = 2\n\nIntegrating with respect to x, we obtain:\n\np(x, y) = -2x + C(y)\n\nSince there is no dependence on y in the x-momentum equation, we can assume that C(y) = C, a constant. Thus, the pressure field is given by:\n\np(x, y) = -2x + C\n\nIn summary, the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for the given problem is:\n\nu(x, y) = (2/μ)(yH - y²/2)\nv(x, y) = 0\np(x, y) = -2x + C\n\nWhere μ = 0.002 Pa·s, H = 0.05 m, and C is a constant."
