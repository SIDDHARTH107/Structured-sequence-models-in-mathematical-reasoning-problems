    "message_2": "First, let's multiply the third equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 6\n2x - 2y + 4z = -3\n-2x + y - 2z = 4\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Add the first and third equations to eliminate x in the third equation:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 6\n2x - 2y + 4z = -3\n(3x + 2y - z) + (-2x + y - 2z) = 6 + 4\nx + 3y - 3z = 10\n\nNow we have:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 6\n2x - 2y + 4z = -3\nx + 3y - 3z = 10\n\nStep 2: Subtract the first equation multiplied by 2/3 from the second equation to eliminate x in the second equation:\n\n(2x - 2y + 4z) - (2/3)(3x + 2y - z) = -3 - (2/3)(6)\n2x - 2y + 4z - 2x - 4/3y + 2/3z = -3 - 4\n-10/3y + 14/3z = -7\n\nNow we have:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 6\n-10/3y + 14/3z = -7\nx + 3y - 3z = 10\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second equation by -3/10 to simplify:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 6\ny - 1.4z = 2.1\nx + 3y - 3z = 10\n\nStep 4: Subtract the third equation multiplied by 3 from the first equation to eliminate y in the first equation:\n\n(3x + 2y - z) - 3(x + 3y - 3z) = 6 - 3(10)\n3x + 2y - z - 3x - 9y + 9z = 6 - 30\n-7y + 8z = -24\n\nNow we have:\n\n-7y + 8z = -24\ny - 1.4z = 2.1\nx + 3y - 3z = 10\n\nStep 5: Divide the first equation by -7:\n\ny - 1.142857z = 3.428571\n\nNow we have:\n\ny - 1.142857z = 3.428571\ny - 1.4z = 2.1\nx + 3y - 3z = 10\n\nStep 6: Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate y:\n\n(1.4z - 1.142857z) = 2.1 - 3.428571\n0.257143z = -1.328571\n\nStep 7: Divide the equation by 0.257143 to find z:\n\nz = -5.166667\n\nStep 8: Substitute z back into the first equation to find y:\n\ny - 1.142857(-5.166667) = 3.428571\ny + 5.904762 = 3.428571\ny = -2.476190\n\nStep 9: Substitute y and z back into the third equation to find x:\n\nx + 3(-2.476190) - 3(-5.166667) = 10\nx - 7.428571 + 15.5 = 10\nx = 1.928571\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1.928571, y = -2.476190, and z = -5.166667."
