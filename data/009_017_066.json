    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at point P due to the current-carrying wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to an infinitesimal length of wire dl carrying a current I is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, r is the vector from the wire element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a straight wire carrying current in the positive x-direction, the magnetic field will be in the z-direction due to the right-hand rule. Therefore, we can simplify the problem to finding the magnitude of the magnetic field B in the z-direction.\n\nTo find the total magnetic field at point P, we need to integrate the contribution from each infinitesimal length of the wire:\n\nB = ∫dB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(dl / (x^2 + y^2)) from x = 0 to x = 10\n\nwhere y = 2 meters is the distance from the wire to point P.\n\nLet's solve the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * ∫(dx / (x^2 + 4)) from x = 0 to x = 10\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * [arctan(x/2)] from x = 0 to x = 10\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * [arctan(10/2) - arctan(0/2)]\nB = (μ₀ * I / 4π) * arctan(5)\n\nNow, plug in the values for μ₀ and I:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A / 4π) * arctan(5)\nB ≈ 5 × 10^(-7) T * arctan(5)\n\nB ≈ 5 × 10^(-7) T * 1.3734\nB ≈ 6.867 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is approximately 6.867 × 10^(-7) Tesla.\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field is in the positive z-direction, as determined by the right-hand rule."
