Consider the level set $M_c = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid f(x,y) = c\\}$ for $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n(a) Compute the critical points of $f$.\n(b) Compute the index of each critical point.\n(c) Prove that the Morse inequalities hold for $f$ and $M_c$.\n(d) Use the Morse inequalities to compute the Betti numbers of $M_c$ for $c \\in (-\\infty, 0) \\cup [4,\\infty)$.\n(e) Sketch the level set $M_3$ and identify its connected components.",
    "message_2": "(a) To find the critical points of $f$, we need to compute its gradient and set it equal to the zero vector:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x + 2 \\\\ 2y - 4 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSetting the gradient equal to the zero vector, we get:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 2x + 2 \\\\ 2y - 4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find the critical point:\n\n$x = -1, y = 2$\n\nSo the critical point of $f$ is $(-1, 2)$.\n\n(b) To compute the index of the critical point, we need to find the Hessian matrix of $f$:\n\n$H_f(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is constant and has eigenvalues 2 and 2, both of which are positive. Therefore, the index of the critical point $(-1, 2)$ is 0.\n\n(c) The Morse inequalities state that for any smooth function $f$ and its level set $M_c$, the number of critical points of index $k$ is greater than or equal to the $k$-th Betti number of $M_c$. In our case, we have only one critical point of index 0, so the Morse inequalities hold trivially.\n\n(d) Since the index of the critical point is 0, the Morse inequalities tell us that the 0-th Betti number of $M_c$ is at least 1. The 0-th Betti number represents the number of connected components of $M_c$. For $c \\in (-\\infty, 0) \\cup [4,\\infty)$, the level set $M_c$ consists of a single connected component, which is a circle centered at $(-1, 2)$ with radius $\\sqrt{c + 1}$. Therefore, the 0-th Betti number of $M_c$ is 1. The higher Betti numbers are 0, as there are no holes or higher-dimensional features in the level sets.\n\n(e) To sketch the level set $M_3$, we plug in $c = 3$ into the equation for $M_c$:\n\n$f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y = 3$\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$(x+1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 4$\n\nThis is the equation of a circle centered at $(-1, 2)$ with radius 2. The level set $M_3$ consists of a single connected component, which is this circle."
