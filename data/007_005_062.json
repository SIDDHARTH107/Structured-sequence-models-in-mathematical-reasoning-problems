    "message_1": "What is the LCM of 24 and 36?\n\nSolution:\nThe prime factors of 24 are 2, 2, 2, and 3. The prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. The common factors are 2, 2, and 3. The highest power of 2 is 2 to the power of 3, and the highest power of 3 is 3 to the power of 2. Thus, the LCM of 24 and 36 is 2^3 * 3^2 = 72.",
    "message_2": "You are correct. The LCM of 24 and 36 is indeed 72, as calculated using the prime factors and their highest powers."
