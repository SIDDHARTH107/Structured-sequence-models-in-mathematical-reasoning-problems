    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder and the given information.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, we have a cylindrical water tank with a radius of 5 meters and a height of 10 meters. The volume of the tank is being filled at a rate of 3 cubic meters per minute (dV/dt = 3 m³/min). We want to find the rate at which the water level is rising (dh/dt) when the depth of the water is 8 meters.\n\nFirst, let's express the volume of the water in the tank as a function of its height:\n\nV = π(5^2)h\nV = 25πh\n\nNow, we'll differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t):\n\ndV/dt = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nWe know that dV/dt = 3 m³/min, so we can substitute that value into the equation:\n\n3 = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we'll solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = 3 / (25π)\n\nFinally, we'll evaluate dh/dt when the depth of the water is 8 meters:\n\ndh/dt = 3 / (25π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ 0.0381 meters per minute\n\nSo, the water level is rising at a rate of approximately 0.0381 meters per minute (rounded to the nearest hundredth) when the depth of the water is 8 meters."
