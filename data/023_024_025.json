    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of a periodic function f(x) with period 2π, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the series:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity, and\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) has a discontinuity at x=0, we can split the integral into two parts, one from -π to 0 and the other from 0 to π. Let's call the left limit of the function at x=0 as L1 and the right limit as L2. Then, f(x) approaches L1 as x approaches 0 from the left side, and f(x) approaches L2 as x approaches 0 from the right side. It is given that f(x) approaches 0 as x approaches 0 from either side, so L1 = L2 = 0.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_n and b_n:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] f(x) dx + ∫[0, π] f(x) dx] = 0 (since f(x) approaches 0 as x approaches 0)\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] f(x) * cos(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] f(x) * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx]\n\nSince we don't have the explicit function f(x), we cannot find the exact values of a_n and b_n. However, we can write the Fourier series as:\n\nf(x) = Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity, and a_n and b_n are given by the integrals above.\n\nAs for the value of f(0), since f(x) approaches 0 as x approaches 0 from either side, we can say that f(0) is undefined due to the discontinuity at x=0. However, if we were to assign a value to f(0) to make the function continuous, it would be f(0) = 0, as that is the limit from both sides."
