    "message_2": "To find the local minimum of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5 using Newton's Method, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the function.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x\nf''(x) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we will apply Newton's Method for finding the local minimum. The formula for Newton's Method is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nWe are given an initial guess of x0 = 2. Let's perform three iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0)\nx1 = 2 - (3(2)^2 - 4(2)) / (6(2) - 4)\nx1 = 2 - (12 - 8) / (12 - 4)\nx1 = 2 - 4 / 8\nx1 = 2 - 0.5\nx1 = 1.5\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - f'(x1) / f''(x1)\nx2 = 1.5 - (3(1.5)^2 - 4(1.5)) / (6(1.5) - 4)\nx2 = 1.5 - (6.75 - 6) / (9 - 4)\nx2 = 1.5 - 0.75 / 5\nx2 = 1.5 - 0.15\nx2 = 1.35\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - f'(x2) / f''(x2)\nx3 = 1.35 - (3(1.35)^2 - 4(1.35)) / (6(1.35) - 4)\nx3 = 1.35 - (5.445 - 5.4) / (8.1 - 4)\nx3 = 1.35 - 0.045 / 4.1\nx3 = 1.35 - 0.01098\nx3 ≈ 1.34\n\nAfter three iterations, our approximation for the local minimum is x ≈ 1.34, rounded to two decimal places."
