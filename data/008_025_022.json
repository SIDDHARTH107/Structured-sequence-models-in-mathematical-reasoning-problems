    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx - 2y = 6\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y = 7\nx - 2y = 6\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, let's use the elimination method. We can add the two equations together:\n\n(x + 2y) + (x - 2y) = 7 + 6\n2x = 13\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 13/2\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:\n\n(13/2) + 2y = 7\n\nSubtract 13/2 from both sides:\n\n2y = 7 - 13/2\n2y = (14 - 13)/2\n2y = 1/2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for y:\n\ny = (1/2) / 2\ny = 1/4\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 13/2\ny = 1/4"
