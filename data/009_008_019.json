Given that the wave speed is $c = 1$ m/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$ u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) $$\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$ X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t) $$\n\nDividing both sides by $c^2 X(x)T(t)$, we obtain:\n\n$$ \\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} $$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$ T''(t) = -c^2 \\lambda T(t) $$\n\n$$ X''(x) = -\\lambda X(x) $$\n\nThe boundary conditions for the spatial part are $X(0) = X(1) = 0$. The eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for this problem are:\n\n$$ X_n(x) = \\sin(n \\pi x), \\quad \\lambda_n = n^2 \\pi^2 $$\n\nThe temporal part becomes:\n\n$$ T''(t) = -c^2 n^2 \\pi^2 T(t) $$\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\n$$ T_n(t) = A_n \\cos(c n \\pi t) + B_n \\sin(c n \\pi t) $$\n\nSince the string is initially at rest, we have:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0 $$\n\nThis implies that $B_n = 0$. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$$ u_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = A_n \\sin(n \\pi x) \\cos(c n \\pi t) $$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients $A_n$ such that the initial shape of the string is given by:\n\n$$ u(x,0) = x(1-x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n \\pi x) $$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions and multiply both sides by $\\sin(m \\pi x)$ and integrate from 0 to 1:\n\n$$ \\int_0^1 x(1-x) \\sin(m \\pi x) dx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\int_0^1 \\sin(n \\pi x) \\sin(m \\pi x) dx $$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property, the right side simplifies to:\n\n$$ A_m \\int_0^1 \\sin^2(m \\pi x) dx $$\n\nThe integral evaluates to $\\frac{1}{2}$, so we have:\n\n$$ A_m = 2 \\int_0^1 x(1-x) \\sin(m \\pi x) dx $$\n\nTo find $A_m$, we can integrate by parts twice:\n\n$$ A_m = 2 \\left[ \\frac{x(1-x)\\cos(m\\pi x)}{m\\pi} \\Big|_0^1 - \\frac{1}{m\\pi} \\int_0^1 (1-2x) \\cos(m\\pi x) dx \\right] $$\n\nIntegrating by parts again:\n\n$$ A_m = 2 \\left[ \\frac{x(1-x)\\cos(m\\pi x)}{m\\pi} \\Big|_0^1 - \\frac{1}{m\\pi} \\left( \\frac{(1-2x)\\sin(m\\pi x)}{m\\pi} \\Big|_0^1 - \\frac{2}{m\\pi} \\int_0^1 \\sin(m\\pi x) dx \\right) \\right] $$\n\nThe integral evaluates to 0, and after evaluating the remaining terms, we get:\n\n$$ A_m = \\frac{2}{m^2 \\pi^2} (1 - (-1)^m) $$\n\nNow, we can write the solution as:\n\n$$ u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n \\pi x) \\cos(c n \\pi t) $$\n\nSubstituting the values for $A_n$, $c$, $x$, and $t$, we get:\n\n$$ u(0.5, 2) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n^2 \\pi^2} (1 - (-1)^n) \\sin(n \\pi (0.5)) \\cos(n \\pi (2)) $$\n\nSince $\\sin(n \\pi (0.5)) = 0$ for even $n$ and $\\cos(n \\pi (2)) = 1$ for all $n$, the series simplifies to:\n\n$$ u(0.5, 2) = \\sum_{n \\text{ odd}}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n^2 \\pi^2} \\sin(n \\pi (0.5)) $$\n\nThis series converges, and we can approximate the displacement at $x = 0.5$ and $t = 2$ by taking a finite number of terms. The more terms we take, the better the approximation."
