    "message_2": "To solve the given nonlinear differential equation, we can use the conservation of energy method. The given equation is:\n\ny'' + 4y^3 = 0\n\nFirst, we multiply both sides of the equation by y':\n\ny''y' + 4y^3y' = 0\n\nNow, we notice that the left side of the equation is the derivative of a sum of two functions:\n\n(d/dt)(1/2 (y')^2 + y^4) = 0\n\nSince the derivative of the sum is zero, the sum must be a constant:\n\n1/2 (y')^2 + y^4 = C\n\nNow, we use the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0:\n\n1/2 (0)^2 + (1)^4 = C\nC = 1\n\nSo, our equation becomes:\n\n1/2 (y')^2 + y^4 = 1\n\nNow, we want to find y(π/2). Since y'(0) = 0, we know that y'(t) will be zero at the maximum or minimum value of y(t). Let's assume that y(t) has a maximum value at t = π/2. Then, y'(π/2) = 0.\n\nNow, we can use the equation to find y(π/2):\n\n1/2 (0)^2 + y(π/2)^4 = 1\ny(π/2)^4 = 1\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides:\n\ny(π/2) = 1^(1/4)\ny(π/2) = 1\n\nSo, the value of y(π/2) is 1.000 to three decimal places."
