    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with treewidth 4. If G has 12 vertices, what is the maximum number of edges that G can have?",
    "message_2": "A graph with treewidth 4 can be represented by a tree decomposition where each bag (node) in the tree contains at most 5 vertices (treewidth + 1). To maximize the number of edges in G, we can create a clique (complete graph) of 5 vertices, which will have 5 choose 2 = 10 edges. \n\nNow, we need to add the remaining 7 vertices to the graph while maintaining the treewidth of 4. We can do this by connecting each of the 7 vertices to 4 vertices from the initial clique. This will add 7 * 4 = 28 edges to the graph.\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges that G can have is 10 (from the initial clique) + 28 (from connecting the remaining vertices) = 38 edges."
