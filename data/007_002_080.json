    "message_2": "To use the divisibility rule for 9, we need to find the sum of the digits of 5477.\n\n5 + 4 + 7 + 7 = 23\n\nSince 23 is not divisible by 9, 5477 is not divisible by 9. To find the remainder, we can divide 5477 by 9 and find the remainder.\n\n5477 ÷ 9 = 608 with a remainder of 5.\n\nSo, the remainder when 5477 is divided by 9 is 5."
