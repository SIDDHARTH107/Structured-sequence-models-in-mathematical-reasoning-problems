    "message_1": "Consider two firms, Firm A and Firm B, competing in a Bertrand oligopoly in which they simultaneously set prices. Both firms have the same marginal cost of production, which is $50. If Firm A sets a price of $70, what price should Firm B set to maximize its profit? Assume that if both firms set the same price, they split the market evenly.",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand oligopoly, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers will buy from the firm with the lowest price. If both firms set the same price, they split the market evenly. To maximize its profit, Firm B should set a price slightly below Firm A's price.\n\nSince Firm A sets a price of $70 and both firms have the same marginal cost of production ($50), Firm B should set a price just below $70, say $69.99. By doing so, Firm B will capture the entire market, as consumers will choose to buy from Firm B due to its lower price. This will maximize Firm B's profit, as it will sell the most units while still maintaining a price above its marginal cost of production."
