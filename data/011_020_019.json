The time taken by each machine to complete a job is given in the following table:\n\n|    | Job 1 | Job 2 | Job 3 | Job 4 | Job 5 |\n|----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| M1 | 10    | 14    | 12    | 16    | 20    |\n| M2 | 12    | 13    | 20    | 8      | 11    |\n| M3 | 5      | 8      | 12    | 9      | 11    |\n\nWhat is the minimum amount of time required to complete all the jobs and which machine should be assigned to each job to achieve this minimum time?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum amount of time required to complete all the jobs, we need to assign each job to the machine that can complete it in the least amount of time. We can do this by comparing the times for each job across all machines and selecting the minimum time.\n\nJob 1: M3 takes the least time (5)\nJob 2: M3 takes the least time (8)\nJob 3: M1 takes the least time (12)\nJob 4: M2 takes the least time (8)\nJob 5: M2 takes the least time (11)\n\nNow, we need to find the total time taken by each machine to complete their assigned jobs:\n\nM1: 12 (Job 3)\nM2: 8 (Job 4) + 11 (Job 5) = 19\nM3: 5 (Job 1) + 8 (Job 2) = 13\n\nThe minimum amount of time required to complete all the jobs is the maximum time taken by any machine, which is 19.\n\nSo, the minimum amount of time required to complete all the jobs is 19, and the machines should be assigned as follows:\n\nJob 1: M3\nJob 2: M3\nJob 3: M1\nJob 4: M2\nJob 5: M2"
