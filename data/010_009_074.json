    "message_2": "To find the total area of the triangles formed by drawing diagonals from each vertex of the regular octagon, we can first find the area of one of these triangles and then multiply it by the number of triangles.\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of an octagon is given by the formula:\n\nSum of interior angles = (n-2) × 180°, where n is the number of sides.\n\nFor an octagon, n = 8, so the sum of the interior angles is (8-2) × 180° = 6 × 180° = 1080°.\n\nSince all angles are equal in a regular octagon, each angle measures:\n\n1080° ÷ 8 = 135°.\n\nNow, let's focus on one of the triangles formed by drawing a diagonal from a vertex. This triangle is an isosceles triangle with two sides equal to the side length of the octagon (4 cm) and the angle between these two sides equal to the angle of the octagon (135°).\n\nTo find the area of this triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)ab × sin(C),\n\nwhere a and b are the sides of the triangle and C is the angle between them.\n\nIn our case, a = b = 4 cm, and C = 135°.\n\nArea = (1/2)(4)(4) × sin(135°)\nArea = 8 × sin(135°)\nArea = 8 × (√2 / 2) (since sin(135°) = √2 / 2)\nArea = 4√2 cm².\n\nNow, there are 8 triangles formed by drawing diagonals from each vertex of the octagon. So, the total area of these triangles is:\n\nTotal area = 8 × (4√2 cm²) = 32√2 cm²."
