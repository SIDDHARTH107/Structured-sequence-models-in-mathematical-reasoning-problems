    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (λ) is a measure of the average rate at which nearby trajectories in phase space diverge or converge. In this case, we are given the average phase space divergence rate of 0.01 for a weather system that exhibits chaotic behavior.\n\nSince the Lyapunov exponent is equal to the average phase space divergence rate, we have:\n\nλ = 0.01\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the Lyapunov exponent of the weather system is:\n\nλ ≈ 0.01"
