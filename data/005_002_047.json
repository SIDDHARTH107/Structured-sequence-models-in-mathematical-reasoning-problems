    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA study found that the average height of students in a school is 165 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. Suppose a sample of 25 students was taken from the school. Calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true mean height of the school population.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true mean height of the school population, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nHere, the sample mean is 165 cm, the standard deviation is 10 cm, and the sample size is 25 students. First, we need to calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\nStandard Error = 10 cm / √25\nStandard Error = 10 cm / 5\nStandard Error = 2 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the critical value for a 90% confidence interval. We will use the Z-score for this calculation, as the sample size is large enough. The Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is 1.645 (you can find this value in a Z-score table or using a calculator).\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 165 cm ± (1.645 * 2 cm)\nConfidence Interval = 165 cm ± 3.29 cm\n\nSo, the 90% confidence interval for the true mean height of the school population is approximately 161.71 cm to 168.29 cm."
