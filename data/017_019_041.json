    "message_2": "There are four non-abelian groups of order 36. They are as follows:\n\n1. The semi-direct product of Z9 and Z4, denoted as Z9 ⋊ Z4, where Zn represents the cyclic group of order n. This group arises when Z4 acts on Z9 by automorphisms of order 2.\n\n2. The semi-direct product of Z3 and Z12, denoted as Z3 ⋊ Z12. This group arises when Z12 acts on Z3 by automorphisms of order 2.\n\n3. The semi-direct product of Z3 and Z4 ⋊ Z3, denoted as Z3 ⋊ (Z4 ⋊ Z3). This group arises when Z4 ⋊ Z3 acts on Z3 by automorphisms of order 3.\n\n4. The special linear group SL(2,3), which is the group of 2x2 matrices with determinant 1 over the finite field with 3 elements. This group is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2,3), which is the quotient of SL(2,3) by its center.\n\nThese are all the non-abelian groups of order 36 up to isomorphism."
