    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 216 and 594 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (594) by the smaller number (216) and find the remainder.\n   594 รท 216 = 2 with a remainder of 162.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (594) with the smaller number (216) and the smaller number with the remainder (162) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 216 and 162.\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n   216 รท 162 = 1 with a remainder of 54.\n   Replace 216 with 162 and 162 with 54.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 162 and 54.\n\n   162 รท 54 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 54.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 216 and 594 is 54."
