    "message_2": "First, let's consider the case where G is abelian. Since the order of G is 27, which is a prime power (3^3), we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. This theorem states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nIn our case, the only possible decompositions of 27 as a product of prime powers are 27 = 3^3. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n1. C_27 (a cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C_3 × C_9 (a direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 9)\n3. C_3 × C_3 × C_3 (a direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nHowever, since C_3 × C_9 and C_3 × C_3 × C_3 both have elements of order 3, they have non-trivial centers (the center of a group is the set of elements that commute with all other elements). In particular, the center of C_3 × C_9 is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3, and the center of C_3 × C_3 × C_3 is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3 × C_3. In both cases, the center is a proper, non-trivial subgroup of the group.\n\nOn the other hand, the center of a cyclic group of order 27 is the entire group itself. Since G is abelian, its center must be the entire group. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to C_3 × C_9 or C_3 × C_3 × C_3, as their centers are proper subgroups. Thus, G must be isomorphic to C_27.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is non-abelian. Since G has order 27, it must have a non-trivial center. Let Z(G) be the center of G. By the Class Equation, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nwhere C(x) is the centralizer of x in G, and the sum is taken over one representative x from each conjugacy class of G outside Z(G). Since |G| = 27 and |Z(G)| > 0, it follows that |Z(G)| must be a divisor of 27. The only divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. Since G is non-abelian, |Z(G)| cannot be 27, as that would imply G is abelian.\n\nIf |Z(G)| = 9, then G/Z(G) is a group of order 3, which is cyclic. By a well-known result, if the quotient group G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G must be abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, |Z(G)| cannot be 9.\n\nSo, we are left with the case where |Z(G)| = 3. In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 9, which must be isomorphic to either C_9 or C_3 × C_3. However, if G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3, then G would be a semidirect product of Z(G) and a subgroup isomorphic to C_3 × C_3. This would imply that G has a normal subgroup of order 9, which would force G to be abelian, contradicting our assumption. Therefore, G/Z(G) must be isomorphic to C_9.\n\nNow, let H be a subgroup of G such that G = Z(G)H and H is isomorphic to C_9. Then G is a semidirect product of Z(G) and H. Since |Z(G)| = 3 and |H| = 9, there is only one non-abelian group of order 27 up to isomorphism, which is the semidirect product of Z(G) and H. Thus, G must be isomorphic to this non-abelian group of order 27."
