Let $X$ be the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold to this hypersurface. Find the Hodge numbers of $X$, i.e., compute $h^{p,q}(X)$ for all pairs $(p,q)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge numbers of the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold $X$, we first need to find the Hodge numbers of the original Fermat quintic hypersurface $Y$. The Hodge diamond of a Calabi-Yau threefold has the following form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n & & & & h^{0,0} & & & & \\\\\n & & & h^{1,0} & & h^{0,1} & & & \\\\\n & & h^{2,0} & & h^{1,1} & & h^{0,2} & & \\\\\n & h^{3,0} & & h^{2,1} & & h^{1,2} & & h^{0,3} & \\\\\nh^{3,3} & & h^{2,2} & & h^{1,3} & & h^{0,4} & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSince $Y$ is a Calabi-Yau threefold, we have $h^{p,0}(Y) = h^{0,p}(Y) = 0$ for $p = 1, 2, 3$. The Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}(Y)$ and $h^{2,1}(Y)$ can be computed using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the fact that $Y$ is a degree 5 hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. We have:\n\n$$\nh^{1,1}(Y) = h^{1,1}(\\mathbb{P}^4) - 1 = 0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nh^{2,1}(Y) = h^{3,2}(\\mathbb{P}^4) - 5h^{2,2}(\\mathbb{P}^4) + 5^2 h^{1,2}(\\mathbb{P}^4) - 5^3 h^{0,2}(\\mathbb{P}^4) = 101.\n$$\n\nNow, we can use mirror symmetry to compute the Hodge numbers of the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold $X$. Mirror symmetry swaps the Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$, so we have:\n\n$$\nh^{1,1}(X) = h^{2,1}(Y) = 101\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nh^{2,1}(X) = h^{1,1}(Y) = 0.\n$$\n\nThus, the Hodge diamond of the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n & & & & 1 & & & & \\\\\n & & & 0 & & 0 & & & \\\\\n & & 0 & & 101 & & 0 & & \\\\\n & 0 & & 0 & & 0 & & 0 & \\\\\n1 & & 0 & & 0 & & 0 & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSo, the Hodge numbers of $X$ are $h^{0,0}(X) = h^{3,3}(X) = 1$, $h^{1,1}(X) = 101$, and all other Hodge numbers are zero."
