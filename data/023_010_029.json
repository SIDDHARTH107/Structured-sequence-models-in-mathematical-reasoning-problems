    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem:\n\nAn image of size 512 x 512 has been transformed by the 2D Fourier transform. The resulting complex values are stored in memory. How much memory is required to store the complex values? \n\nAssume that each complex value is stored as two 4-byte floating-point numbers (real and imaginary parts) and that there are no wasted bytes in memory.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the memory required to store the complex values, we need to consider the size of the image and the size of each complex value.\n\nThe image size is 512 x 512, which results in a total of 512 * 512 = 262,144 complex values.\n\nEach complex value is stored as two 4-byte floating-point numbers (real and imaginary parts). So, the size of each complex value is 2 * 4 bytes = 8 bytes.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total memory required:\n\nMemory = (Number of complex values) * (Size of each complex value)\nMemory = 262,144 * 8 bytes\nMemory = 2,097,152 bytes\n\nSo, 2,097,152 bytes of memory are required to store the complex values."
