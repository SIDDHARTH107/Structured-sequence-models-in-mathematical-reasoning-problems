    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve of f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1 at the point where x = 4, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 4.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1 with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 - 3x + 1)/dx = 4x - 3\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 4(4) - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 4 is 13."
