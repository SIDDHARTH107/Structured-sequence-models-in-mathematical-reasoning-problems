    "message_1": "A metal plate with sides of length 2 meters and thickness of 5 cm has a steady heat flux of 10 kW/m² applied at one face. The other face is kept at a constant temperature of 100°C. Using Fourier transform, determine the temperature profile inside the plate at a distance of 1 meter away from the heated surface after 10 minutes. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.5 × 10⁻⁶ m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation with constant thermal diffusivity, α:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, and x is the distance from the heated surface.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given information into the appropriate units:\n\n- Thickness of the plate: 5 cm = 0.05 m\n- Heat flux: 10 kW/m² = 10,000 W/m²\n- Time: 10 minutes = 600 seconds\n- Thermal diffusivity: α = 0.5 × 10⁻⁶ m²/s\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier transform to solve the heat conduction equation. The Fourier transform of the temperature T(x, t) is given by:\n\nT(k, t) = ∫ T(x, t) e^(-ikx) dx\n\nwhere k is the wave number. Applying the Fourier transform to the heat conduction equation, we get:\n\n∂T(k, t)/∂t = -αk²T(k, t)\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time, which can be solved using separation of variables:\n\ndT(k, t)/T(k, t) = -αk² dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(T(k, t)) = -αk²t + C(k)\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides:\n\nT(k, t) = C(k) e^(-αk²t)\n\nNow, we need to find the initial condition T(k, 0) by applying the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nT(x, 0) = (1/2π) ∫ T(k, 0) e^(ikx) dk\n\nSince the temperature profile is initially unknown, we need to use the given boundary conditions to find T(x, 0). The boundary conditions are:\n\n1. Heat flux at the heated surface (x = 0): q = -kₒ ∂T/∂x |_(x=0) = 10,000 W/m², where kₒ is the thermal conductivity of the metal.\n2. Constant temperature at the other face (x = 0.05 m): T(0.05, t) = 100°C.\n\nUsing the boundary conditions and the inverse Fourier transform, we can find the initial temperature profile T(x, 0). Then, we can use the solution T(k, t) = C(k) e^(-αk²t) to find the temperature profile at a distance of 1 meter away from the heated surface (x = 1 m) after 10 minutes (t = 600 s).\n\nHowever, solving this problem analytically is quite complex and typically requires numerical methods, such as the finite difference method or finite element method, to obtain an accurate solution for the temperature profile T(x, t)."
