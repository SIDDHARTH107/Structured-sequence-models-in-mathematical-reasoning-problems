    "message_2": "Let the length of the field be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangular field is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 500 meters of fencing material, we can write the equation as:\n\n500 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum area enclosed by the fence. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can rearrange the perimeter equation to solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (500 - 2L) / 2\nW = 250 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W in the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (250 - L)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of L:\n\nArea = -L^2 + 250L\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can find the vertex of the parabola represented by this quadratic equation. The x-coordinate of the vertex (L-coordinate in this case) can be found using the formula:\n\nL_vertex = -b / (2a)\n\nIn our equation, a = -1 and b = 250, so:\n\nL_vertex = -250 / (2 * -1)\nL_vertex = 125\n\nNow, we can find the width using the expression for W:\n\nW = 250 - L_vertex\nW = 250 - 125\nW = 125\n\nSo, the length and width of the field that will enclose the maximum area are both 125 meters. The maximum area enclosed by the fence is:\n\nArea_max = 125 * 125 = 15,625 square meters."
