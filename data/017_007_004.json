    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will first show that every element of G must have order 1, 2, 3, or 6. Then, we will show that the structure of G must be either cyclic or dihedral.\n\nRecall that the order of an element a in a group G is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element of G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Since the order of G is 6, the possible orders of its elements are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of G. We know that G has an element of order 1, which is the identity element e. If G has an element of order 6, then G is generated by that element and is thus isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nIf G does not have an element of order 6, then the possible orders of its non-identity elements are 2 and 3. Let a be an element of order 2, and b be an element of order 3. Since the orders of a and b are coprime, the order of the product ab is the product of their orders, i.e., o(ab) = o(a)o(b) = 2 * 3 = 6. This means that G is generated by a and b, and their product has order 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible relations between a and b. Since a^2 = e and b^3 = e, we have (ab)^6 = a^6b^6 = e. This implies that (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 or (ab)^3 = a^3b^3. In the first case, we have a^2b^2 = e, which implies that abab = e. This is the relation for the dihedral group D3, so G is isomorphic to D3 in this case.\n\nIn the second case, we have a^3b^3 = e, which implies that aababb = e. Since a^2 = e, this reduces to abab = e, which is again the relation for the dihedral group D3. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D3 in this case as well.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that every element of G must have order 1, 2, 3, or 6, and that the structure of G must be either cyclic or dihedral. Therefore, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
