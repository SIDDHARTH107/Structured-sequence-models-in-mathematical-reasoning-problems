    "message_1": "Let X be a closed, oriented 2-dimensional manifold embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Suppose that X is obtained from the unit sphere by removing 4 open disks each with radius 1/4 and centered at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in the unit sphere.\n\nWhat is the intersection number (mod 2) of any two closed loops on X that intersect transversely?",
    "message_2": "Let A and B be two closed loops on X that intersect transversely. The intersection number of A and B, denoted as I(A, B), is the algebraic count of the intersection points of A and B, where each intersection point is counted with a sign depending on the orientation of A and B at the intersection point.\n\nSince X is a closed, oriented 2-dimensional manifold, we can use the properties of intersection numbers to determine I(A, B) mod 2. Recall that the intersection number satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. I(A, B) = -I(B, A)\n2. I(A, B) = I(A + A', B) + I(A, B + B') for any closed loops A' and B' on X\n3. I(A, A) = 0 for any closed loop A on X\n\nNow, consider the intersection number I(A, B) mod 2. Since I(A, B) = -I(B, A), we have I(A, B) mod 2 = -I(B, A) mod 2. Furthermore, since I(A, A) = 0, we have I(A, A) mod 2 = 0. Using property 2, we can write:\n\nI(A, B) mod 2 = I(A + A, B) mod 2 + I(A, B + B) mod 2 = I(A, B) mod 2 + I(A, B) mod 2\n\nThis implies that 0 = 2 * I(A, B) mod 2, which means that the intersection number I(A, B) mod 2 is always 0 for any two closed loops A and B on X that intersect transversely."
