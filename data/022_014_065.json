    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is a harmonic function, it satisfies the Laplace equation, which means that it can be represented as the real part of a holomorphic function. Let $g(z)$ be a holomorphic function such that $f(z) = \\operatorname{Re}(g(z))$. \n\nWe know that $f(0) = 2$ and $f(1) = 5$. Since $g(z)$ is holomorphic, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and we can write $g(z) = u(z) + iv(z)$, where $u(z) = f(z)$ and $v(z)$ is the imaginary part of $g(z)$. \n\nNow, consider the function $h(z) = g(z) + g(-z)$. This function is also holomorphic, and its real part is given by $u(z) + u(-z) = f(z) + f(-z)$. Since $f(z)$ is harmonic, it satisfies the mean value property, which states that the value of a harmonic function at a point is equal to the average of its values on any circle centered at that point.\n\nLet's apply the mean value property to the point $z = 0$. We know that $f(0) = 2$, and we want to find the average value of $f(z)$ on the circle $|z| = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $f(z)$ is harmonic, we have:\n\n$$2 = f(0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}\\right) d\\theta$$\n\nNow, we want to find $f(-i/2)$. Since $f(z)$ is the real part of $h(z)$, we have:\n\n$$f\\left(-\\frac{i}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ h\\left(-\\frac{i}{2}\\right) + h\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right) \\right]$$\n\nUsing the mean value property, we can write:\n\n$$f\\left(-\\frac{i}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}\\right) d\\theta + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^{-i\\theta}\\right) d\\theta \\right]$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is harmonic, it is also symmetric with respect to the real axis, so $f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^{-i\\theta}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}\\right)$. Therefore, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$$f\\left(-\\frac{i}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}\\right) d\\theta \\right]$$\n\nWe already know that the average value of $f(z)$ on the circle $|z| = \\frac{1}{2}$ is equal to $2$, so we have:\n\n$$f\\left(-\\frac{i}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} 2 d\\theta \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2\\pi \\right] = 2$$\n\nSo, the value of $f(-i/2)$ is $2$."
