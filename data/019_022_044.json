    "message_1": "A student wants to buy a book. The bookstore has two editions of the same book. The hardcover edition costs $50 and the paperback edition costs $30. The student estimates that the hardcover edition has a 90% chance of being in good condition, while the paperback edition has a 75% chance of being in good condition. Which edition of the book should the student buy if their main goal is to get a copy in good condition at the lowest cost?",
    "message_2": "To determine which edition of the book the student should buy, we can calculate the expected cost of each edition by multiplying the cost of the book by the probability of it being in good condition.\n\nFor the hardcover edition:\nExpected cost = Cost * Probability of good condition\nExpected cost = $50 * 0.90\nExpected cost = $45\n\nFor the paperback edition:\nExpected cost = Cost * Probability of good condition\nExpected cost = $30 * 0.75\nExpected cost = $22.50\n\nSince the student's main goal is to get a copy in good condition at the lowest cost, they should choose the paperback edition, as its expected cost ($22.50) is lower than the hardcover edition's expected cost ($45)."
