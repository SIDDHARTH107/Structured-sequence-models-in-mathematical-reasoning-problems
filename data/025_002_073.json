    "message_2": "To find the degree and arithmetic genus of X, we first need to find the degrees of the defining polynomials. The degree of the first polynomial is 2, and the degree of the second polynomial is 3. Since X is defined as the intersection of these two polynomials, the degree of X is the product of their degrees, which is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the arithmetic genus of X. The arithmetic genus of a complete intersection of two polynomials in P^3 is given by the formula:\n\ng = (d1 - 1)(d2 - 1) - 1,\n\nwhere d1 and d2 are the degrees of the defining polynomials. In our case, d1 = 2 and d2 = 3, so the arithmetic genus is:\n\ng = (2 - 1)(3 - 1) - 1 = 1 * 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection product of the two hyperplanes H1 and H2 in P^3. H1 is defined by the equation x = 0, and H2 is defined by the equation y = 0. The intersection product of two hyperplanes in P^3 is given by the product of their degrees. Since H1 and H2 are both hyperplanes, their degrees are both 1. Therefore, the intersection product of H1 and H2 is 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nIn summary, the degree of X is 6, the arithmetic genus of X is 1, and the intersection product of the two hyperplanes H1 and H2 in P^3 is 1."
