Use Fourier transform to find the system transfer function H(jω) and the frequency response Y(jω)/U(jω) for the control system when:\n\ny(0) = 2, y'(0) = 0, and u(t) = cos(4t)\n\nEvaluate the frequency response at ω = 2.5.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of y''(t) is (jω)^2Y(jω) and the Fourier transform of y(t) is Y(jω). The Fourier transform of u(t) = cos(4t) is (π/2)[δ(ω - 4) + δ(ω + 4)], where δ is the Dirac delta function. So, the transformed equation becomes:\n\n(jω)^2Y(jω) + Y(jω) = (π/2)[δ(ω - 4) + δ(ω + 4)]\n\nNow, let's find the system transfer function H(jω) = Y(jω)/U(jω):\n\nH(jω) = Y(jω) / [(π/2)[δ(ω - 4) + δ(ω + 4)]]\n\nTo find Y(jω), we can rearrange the transformed equation:\n\nY(jω) = (π/2)[δ(ω - 4) + δ(ω + 4)] / [(jω)^2 + 1]\n\nNow we can find the frequency response Y(jω)/U(jω) by plugging in the given initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 0:\n\nY(jω) = (π/2)[δ(ω - 4) + δ(ω + 4)] / [(jω)^2 + 1]\n\nY(jω)/U(jω) = H(jω) = 1 / [(jω)^2 + 1]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the frequency response at ω = 2.5:\n\nH(j2.5) = 1 / [(j2.5)^2 + 1]\nH(j2.5) = 1 / [(-6.25 + j5) + 1]\nH(j2.5) = 1 / (-5.25 + j5)\n\nTo express H(j2.5) in polar form, we can find the magnitude and phase:\n\nMagnitude = |H(j2.5)| = 1 / sqrt((-5.25)^2 + 5^2) ≈ 0.138\nPhase = arctan(5 / (-5.25)) ≈ 2.498 radians\n\nSo, the frequency response at ω = 2.5 is approximately:\n\nH(j2.5) ≈ 0.138 ∠ 2.498 radians"
