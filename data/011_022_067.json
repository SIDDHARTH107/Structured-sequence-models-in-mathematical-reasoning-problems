Find all possible combinations of items the student can pack in their backpack without exceeding the maximum weight limit.",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the items as A (2 kg), B (4 kg), C (5 kg), and D (7 kg). We need to find all the combinations of these items that do not exceed the maximum weight limit of 10 kg.\n\n1. First, let's consider combinations with only one item:\n   - A (2 kg) - This combination works as it is below the 10 kg limit.\n   - B (4 kg) - This combination works as well.\n   - C (5 kg) - This combination works too.\n   - D (7 kg) - This combination also works.\n\n2. Now, let's consider combinations with two items:\n   - A + B (2 kg + 4 kg = 6 kg) - This combination works.\n   - A + C (2 kg + 5 kg = 7 kg) - This combination works.\n   - A + D (2 kg + 7 kg = 9 kg) - This combination works.\n   - B + C (4 kg + 5 kg = 9 kg) - This combination works.\n   - B + D (4 kg + 7 kg = 11 kg) - This combination does not work as it exceeds the 10 kg limit.\n   - C + D (5 kg + 7 kg = 12 kg) - This combination does not work as it exceeds the 10 kg limit.\n\n3. Now, let's consider combinations with three items:\n   - A + B + C (2 kg + 4 kg + 5 kg = 11 kg) - This combination does not work as it exceeds the 10 kg limit.\n   - A + B + D (2 kg + 4 kg + 7 kg = 13 kg) - This combination does not work as it exceeds the 10 kg limit.\n   - A + C + D (2 kg + 5 kg + 7 kg = 14 kg) - This combination does not work as it exceeds the 10 kg limit.\n   - B + C + D (4 kg + 5 kg + 7 kg = 16 kg) - This combination does not work as it exceeds the 10 kg limit.\n\n4. Finally, let's consider the combination with all four items:\n   - A + B + C + D (2 kg + 4 kg + 5 kg + 7 kg = 18 kg) - This combination does not work as it exceeds the 10 kg limit.\n\nSo, the possible combinations of items the student can pack in their backpack without exceeding the maximum weight limit are:\n\n1. A (2 kg)\n2. B (4 kg)\n3. C (5 kg)\n4. D (7 kg)\n5. A + B (6 kg)\n6. A + C (7 kg)\n7. A + D (9 kg)\n8. B + C (9 kg)"
