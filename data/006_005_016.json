    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of a customer making a purchase during a randomly selected one-hour time slot as P(one-hour purchase).\n\nSince the store is open for 12 hours a day, we can divide the given probability of a customer making a purchase in a day (0.3) by the number of one-hour time slots in a day (12) to find the probability of a customer making a purchase during a randomly selected one-hour time slot.\n\nP(one-hour purchase) = P(daily purchase) / number of one-hour time slots\nP(one-hour purchase) = 0.3 / 12\n\nP(one-hour purchase) = 0.025\n\nSo, the probability that a customer will make a purchase during a randomly selected one-hour time slot is 0.025 or 2.5%."
