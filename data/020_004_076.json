The company wants to produce at least 50 units of product A and at least 100 units of product B each day. Product A can be sold for $250 per unit and product B can be sold for $300 per unit. What is the maximum profit that the company can make each day given the constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe cost of producing x units of product A and y units of product B is given by the equation:\n\n100x + 150y ≤ 10,000 (daily budget constraint)\n\nThe company wants to produce at least 50 units of product A and at least 100 units of product B each day, so we have the constraints:\n\nx ≥ 50\ny ≥ 100\n\nThe profit from selling x units of product A and y units of product B is given by the equation:\n\nProfit = 250x + 300y - (100x + 150y)\n\nSimplifying the profit equation, we get:\n\nProfit = 150x + 150y\n\nNow we need to maximize the profit function subject to the constraints. We can rewrite the budget constraint as:\n\ny ≤ (10,000 - 100x) / 150\n\nNow we can find the maximum profit by checking the profit at the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. (x, y) = (50, 100)\nProfit = 150(50) + 150(100) = 7,500 + 15,000 = $22,500\n\n2. (x, y) = (50, (10,000 - 100(50)) / 150)\ny = (10,000 - 5,000) / 150 = 5,000 / 150 ≈ 33.33 (but y must be at least 100, so this point is not feasible)\n\n3. (x, y) = ((10,000 - 150(100)) / 100, 100)\nx = (10,000 - 15,000) / 100 = -5,000 / 100 = -50 (but x must be at least 50, so this point is not feasible)\n\nThe only feasible corner point is (50, 100), so the maximum profit the company can make each day is $22,500."
