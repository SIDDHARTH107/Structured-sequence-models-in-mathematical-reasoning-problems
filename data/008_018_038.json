    "message_2": "First, let's express the given system of linear equations as a matrix equation $Ax = b$:\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 3 \\\\ -2 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}$, $x = \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$, and $b = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 11 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we can use Gaussian elimination to solve the system. First, we will augment the matrix $A$ with the matrix $b$:\n\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 2 & 1 & 5 \\\\ 4 & 3 & 11 \\\\ -2 & 5 & 2 \\end{array}\\right]$\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2:\n\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 & 0.5 & 2.5 \\\\ 4 & 3 & 11 \\\\ -2 & 5 & 2 \\end{array}\\right]$\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and add 2 times the first row to the third row:\n\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 & 0.5 & 2.5 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 6 & 7 \\end{array}\\right]$\n\nStep 3: Subtract 6 times the second row from the third row:\n\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 & 0.5 & 2.5 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right]$\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the augmented matrix:\n\n$x = 2.5 - 0.5(1) = 2$\n$y = 1$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is $x = 2$ and $y = 1$."
