    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a burglary occurring in a week, we need to first find the average number of burglaries per week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can divide the average number of burglaries per month by 4:\n\n2 burglaries/month ÷ 4 weeks/month ≈ 0.5 burglaries/week\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution to find the probability of a burglary occurring in a week. The Poisson distribution formula is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x events occurring, λ is the average number of events (in this case, 0.5 burglaries/week), and x! is the factorial of x.\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least one burglary occurring in a week, so we will calculate the probability of zero burglaries and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least one burglary.\n\nFor x = 0:\n\nP(0) = (e^(-0.5) * 0.5^0) / 0! = (0.6065 * 1) / 1 = 0.6065\n\nNow, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one burglary:\n\nP(at least 1) = 1 - P(0) = 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in a particular neighborhood in a week, given the historical data, is approximately 39.35%."
