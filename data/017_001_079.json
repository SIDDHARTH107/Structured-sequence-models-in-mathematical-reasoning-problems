    "message_2": "There are two distinct groups of order 4: the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4. Their multiplication tables are as follows:\n\nC4:\nThe elements of C4 are {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element and a is a generator of the group. The multiplication table for C4 is:\n\n```\n   | e  a  a^2  a^3\n---+--------------\n e | e  a  a^2  a^3\n a | a a^2  a^3  e\na^2|a^2 a^3  e   a\na^3|a^3 e   a  a^2\n```\n\nV4:\nThe elements of V4 are {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c are elements of order 2. The multiplication table for V4 is:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  c\n---+-----------\n e | e  a  b  c\n a | a  e  c  b\n b | b  c  e  a\n c | c  b  a  e\n```\n\nIn summary, the multiplication table for the cyclic group C4 has a cyclic structure, with the generator a cycling through its powers, while the multiplication table for the Klein four-group V4 has all non-identity elements having order 2."
