    "message_1": "Assume the weight of apples harvested by a farmer follows a normal distribution with a mean weight of 135 grams and a standard deviation of 15 grams. If a sample of 100 apples is selected at random, what is the probability that the average weight of this sample is less than 130 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the average weight of the sample is less than 130 grams, we can use the z-score formula for sample means. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere X is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, X = 130 grams, μ = 135 grams, σ = 15 grams, and n = 100.\n\nz = (130 - 135) / (15 / √100)\nz = (-5) / (15 / 10)\nz = (-5) / 1.5\nz = -3.33\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -3.33. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being less than -3.33 is approximately 0.0004 or 0.04%.\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the sample of 100 apples is less than 130 grams is approximately 0.04%."
