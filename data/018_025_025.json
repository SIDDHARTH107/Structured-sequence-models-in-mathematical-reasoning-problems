    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1} (elements in A but not in B)\nB - A = {4} (elements in B but not in A)\n\nA ∆ B = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection. In other words, we need to show that (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) ≠ (A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B).\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3} = ∅ (empty set, since there are no common elements)\n\n(A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B) = {2, 3} ∩ {1, 4} = ∅ (empty set, since there are no common elements)\n\nSince both expressions are equal to the empty set, the symmetric difference of A and B is actually commutative with respect to intersection:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = (A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∆ B) = ∅"
