They want to find the optimal way to supply their products from the factories to the centers and minimize transportation costs.\n\nThe table below shows the distance between each factory and distribution center:\n  \n|  |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Factory 1 | 22 | 13 | 18 | 15 |\n| Factory 2 | 17 | 16 | 11 | 19 |\n| Factory 3 | 14 | 12 | 20 | 21 |\n\nThe transportation costs per unit of product are as follows:\n  \n|  |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Factory 1 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 5 |\n| Factory 2 | 3 | 7 | 6 | 4 |\n| Factory 3 | 5 | 3 | 7 | 6 |\n\nIf each distribution center requires 1200 units of products per day, what is the minimum transportation cost required to meet the demand from all distribution centers?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum transportation cost, we need to determine the optimal factory to supply each distribution center. We can do this by multiplying the transportation cost per unit by the distance for each factory and distribution center combination and then selecting the factory with the lowest cost for each center.\n\nCost for each factory and distribution center combination:\n\n|  |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Factory 1 | 4*22=88 | 6*13=78 | 8*18=144 | 5*15=75 |\n| Factory 2 | 3*17=51 | 7*16=112 | 6*11=66 | 4*19=76 |\n| Factory 3 | 5*14=70 | 3*12=36 | 7*20=140 | 6*21=126 |\n\nOptimal factory for each distribution center:\n\nA: Factory 2 (51)\nB: Factory 3 (36)\nC: Factory 2 (66)\nD: Factory 1 (75)\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum transportation cost by multiplying the optimal cost by the number of units required (1200) for each distribution center and summing the costs:\n\nA: 51 * 1200 = 61200\nB: 36 * 1200 = 43200\nC: 66 * 1200 = 79200\nD: 75 * 1200 = 90000\n\nTotal minimum transportation cost: 61200 + 43200 + 79200 + 90000 = 273600"
