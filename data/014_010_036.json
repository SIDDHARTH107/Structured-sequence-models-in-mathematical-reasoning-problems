    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first convert each letter in the message \"HELLO WORLD\" to its corresponding position in the alphabet, then shift each position 5 letters to the right (modulo 26), and finally convert the shifted positions back to letters.\n\n1. Convert the message to its corresponding positions in the alphabet:\n   H  E  L  L  O   W  O  R  L  D\n   8  5 12 12 15  23 15 18 12  4\n\n2. Shift each position 5 letters to the right (modulo 26):\n   8+5  5+5 12+5 12+5 15+5  23+5 15+5 18+5 12+5  4+5\n   13   10  17  17  20   2  20  23  17  9\n\n   Note: For the letter W (23), when we add 5, we get 28. Since we are working modulo 26, we subtract 26 from 28 to get 2.\n\n3. Convert the shifted positions back to letters:\n   M  J  Q  Q  T   B  T  W  Q  I\n\nThe resulting cipher text for the message \"HELLO WORLD\" is \"MJQQT BTWQI\"."
