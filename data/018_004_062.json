    "message_2": "To determine the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nLet's assume the universal set U contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Then, set A = {1, 2, 3}.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of set A, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}. In this case, A' = {4, 5, 6}.\n\nTo show that the complement of set A is unique, we need to prove that there cannot be another set B' that is also the complement of set A.\n\nSuppose there is another set B' that is the complement of set A. Then, B' must also contain all the elements in U that are not in set A. Since A' already contains all the elements in U that are not in set A, B' must be equal to A'. Therefore, the complement of set A is unique, and in this case, it is the set A' = {4, 5, 6}."
