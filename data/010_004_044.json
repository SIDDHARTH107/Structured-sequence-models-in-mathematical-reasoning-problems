    "message_2": "Yes, Y is compact. To justify this, we will show that Y is both closed and bounded.\n\nFirst, let's show that Y is bounded. Since all elements in X are of the form 1/n, where n is a positive integer, all elements in X are positive and less than or equal to 1. Therefore, all elements in Y are in the interval [0, 1], which means Y is bounded.\n\nNow, let's show that Y is closed. To do this, we will show that the complement of Y in the real line R is open. The complement of Y consists of all real numbers except 0 and numbers of the form 1/n. We can write the complement of Y as the union of open intervals:\n\nComplement of Y = (-âˆž, 0) U (0, 1/2) U (1/2, 1/3) U (1/3, 1/4) U ...\n\nEach of these intervals is open, and the union of open sets is also open. Therefore, the complement of Y is open, which means Y is closed.\n\nSince Y is both closed and bounded, by the Heine-Borel theorem, Y is compact."
