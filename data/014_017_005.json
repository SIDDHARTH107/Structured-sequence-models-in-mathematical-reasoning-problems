    "message_1": "In a ciphertext that has been encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, the letter \"E\" appears 150 times. What is the expected frequency of the letter \"E\" in the original plaintext of the message according to the English language frequency distribution?",
    "message_2": "The frequency of the letter \"E\" in the English language is approximately 12.7%. To find the expected frequency of the letter \"E\" in the original plaintext, we can use the following formula:\n\nExpected frequency = (Number of occurrences of the letter \"E\" / Total number of letters in the ciphertext) * 100\n\nHowever, we don't have the total number of letters in the ciphertext. We can only provide the expected frequency of the letter \"E\" in the English language, which is 12.7%."
