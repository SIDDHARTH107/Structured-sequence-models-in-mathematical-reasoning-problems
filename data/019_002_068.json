    "message_2": "To prove this statement, we can use a direct proof method. Let n be any positive integer. We need to find a positive integer m such that m > n and m is a multiple of n.\n\nConsider m = 2n. Since n is a positive integer, 2n is also a positive integer and is clearly greater than n (m > n). Furthermore, m is a multiple of n because m = 2n, which means that m can be divided by n without any remainder.\n\nThus, for every positive integer n, there exists a positive integer m (in this case, m = 2n) such that m > n and m is a multiple of n. The statement is proven to be true."
