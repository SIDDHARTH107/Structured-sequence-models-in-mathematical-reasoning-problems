    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has length 6 cm, width 8 cm, and height 10 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (d) is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h):\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 6 cm, the width is 8 cm, and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √(6² + 8² + 10²)\nd = √(36 + 64 + 100)\nd = √200\nd ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.14 cm."
