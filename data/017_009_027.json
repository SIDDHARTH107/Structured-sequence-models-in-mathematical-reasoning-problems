    "message_2": "To prove that a has order 3, we need to show that a³ = e and a² ≠ e.\n\nSince G is a group of order 9, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nWe know that a ≠ e, so the order of a cannot be 1. If the order of a is 9, then G would be a cyclic group generated by a, but this contradicts the assumption that the order of G is 9. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the order of a is 3.\n\nNow we need to show that a³ = e and a² ≠ e. Since the order of a is 3, by definition, a³ = e. To show that a² ≠ e, assume for contradiction that a² = e. Then, a⁻¹ = a, and a³ = a * a² = a * e = a, which contradicts the fact that a³ = e. Therefore, a² ≠ e.\n\nIn conclusion, if a ∈ G and a ≠ e, then a has order 3."
