    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4 (N = 4), and the length of each segment is reduced to one-third of its previous length (S = 3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension remains the same after each iteration, so after the first three iterations, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is still approximately 1.2619."
