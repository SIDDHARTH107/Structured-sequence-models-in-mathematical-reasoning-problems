This algorithm works for two or more machines and minimizes the makespan (the total time to complete all jobs).\n\n1. Identify the smallest processing time among all jobs and machines.\n2. If the smallest processing time is on Machine 1, schedule the job as early as possible. If it's on Machine 2, schedule the job as late as possible.\n3. Remove the job from the list and repeat steps 1 and 2 until all jobs are scheduled.\n\nLet's apply Johnson's rule to the given problem:\n\n1. The smallest processing time is 1 (Order 5 on Machine 4).\n2. Since it's on Machine 4 (not Machine 1), we schedule Order 5 as late as possible.\n3.
