In other words, it consists of the elements that are unique to each set.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nLet's find the union, intersection, and symmetric difference of the sets A and B.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (all elements from both sets, without repetition)\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5} (elements common to both sets)\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow let's interchange A and B:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection of sets are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we have:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nThus, we have proven that the symmetric difference remains the same when we interchange A and B:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 2, 6, 7}"
