    "message_2": "To find the values of sin(45°), cos(30°), and tan(60°) using the unit circle, we first need to convert the degrees to radians. \n\n45° = (45 * π) / 180 = π/4\n30° = (30 * π) / 180 = π/6\n60° = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3\n\nNow, let's find the values using the unit circle:\n\n1. sin(45°) = sin(π/4)\nIn the unit circle, sin(θ) represents the y-coordinate of the point where the angle θ intersects the circle. For a 45° angle or π/4 radians, the point on the unit circle is (1/√2, 1/√2). Therefore, sin(45°) = sin(π/4) = 1/√2 or √2/2.\n\n2. cos(30°) = cos(π/6)\nIn the unit circle, cos(θ) represents the x-coordinate of the point where the angle θ intersects the circle. For a 30° angle or π/6 radians, the point on the unit circle is (√3/2, 1/2). Therefore, cos(30°) = cos(π/6) = √3/2.\n\n3. tan(60°) = tan(π/3)\nIn the unit circle, tan(θ) is the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate of the point where the angle θ intersects the circle. For a 60° angle or π/3 radians, the point on the unit circle is (1/2, √3/2). Therefore, tan(60°) = tan(π/3) = (√3/2) / (1/2) = √3.\n\nSo, sin(45°) = √2/2, cos(30°) = √3/2, and tan(60°) = √3."
