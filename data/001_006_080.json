    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x - 5, we first need to find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nh = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c. In this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = -5.\n\nh = -4 / (2 * 1) = -4 / 2 = -2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex (h), we can find the y-coordinate (k) by plugging h back into the equation:\n\nk = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) - 5 = 4 - 8 - 5 = -9\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-2, -9).\n\nNext, we need to find the x-intercepts. To do this, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^2 + 4x - 5\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(-5))) / 2(1)\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 20)) / 2\nx = (-4 ± √36) / 2\nx = (-4 ± 6) / 2\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx1 = (-4 + 6) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\nx2 = (-4 - 6) / 2 = -10 / 2 = -5\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are (1, 0) and (-5, 0).\n\nNow that we have the vertex and x-intercepts, we can graph the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x - 5. The parabola will open upwards since the coefficient of x^2 is positive. The vertex is at (-2, -9), and the x-intercepts are at (1, 0) and (-5, 0)."
