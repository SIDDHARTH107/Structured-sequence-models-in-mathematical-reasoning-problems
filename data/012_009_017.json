    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and the following degree sequence: {3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1}. Can this sequence be realized by a simple undirected graph? If so, draw such a graph. If not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "Yes, this sequence can be realized by a simple undirected graph. Here's a possible graph:\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, with their respective degrees as mentioned in the sequence.\n\n1. Connect vertex A (degree 3) to vertices D, E, and F (degrees 2, 2, and 1).\n2. Connect vertex B (degree 3) to vertices D, E, and G (degrees 2, 2, and 1).\n3. Connect vertex C (degree 3) to vertices D, E, and H (degrees 2, 2, and 1).\n\nThe resulting graph will have the following edges:\n\nA-D, A-E, A-F, B-D, B-E, B-G, C-D, C-E, C-H\n\nNow, the degree sequence of this graph is {3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1}, which matches the given degree sequence."
