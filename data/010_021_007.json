    "message_2": "To find the volume of an ellipsoid with semi-axes lengths a, b, and c, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πabc\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = 5, and c = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(4)(5)(6)\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(120)\n\nVolume = 160π\n\nSo, the volume of the ellipsoid is 160π cubic units."
