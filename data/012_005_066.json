    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we first need to understand the concept of diameter. The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, it is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given graph with 11 vertices and 17 edges. In a complete graph with 11 vertices, there would be C(11, 2) = 55 edges. However, our graph has only 17 edges, which means it is not a complete graph.\n\nTo find the diameter, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, the graph would be a tree (a connected graph with no cycles). In this case, the graph would have a minimum diameter of 10, which is achieved when the tree is a straight line (a path) with 11 vertices and 10 edges.\n\nHowever, our graph has 17 edges, which means there must be some cycles in the graph. Adding more edges to the tree will create cycles and reduce the diameter. Therefore, the diameter of the graph will be less than 10.\n\nWithout knowing the exact structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact diameter. However, we can conclude that the diameter of the graph with 11 vertices and 17 edges is less than 10."
