    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to determine the optimal number of units they should produce to maximize their profit. The production cost function is given by C(x) = 100x + 2000 where x is the number of units produced. The revenue function is given by R(x) = 10x^2. However, due to market competition, the company can only sell a maximum of 50 units at a price of $150 per unit, and any units produced beyond 50 will have to be sold at a discounted price of $120 per unit. What is the optimal number of units the company should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of units to produce, we need to find the profit function and then maximize it. The profit function is given by P(x) = R(x) - C(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the revenue function R(x) considering the market competition constraints. If the company produces 50 units or less, the revenue function is R(x) = 150x (since each unit is sold at $150). If the company produces more than 50 units, the revenue function can be split into two parts: the revenue from the first 50 units and the revenue from the remaining units sold at a discounted price of $120 per unit. So, if x > 50, R(x) = 150(50) + 120(x - 50).\n\nNow, let's find the profit function P(x) for both cases:\n\n1. If x ≤ 50, P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 150x - (100x + 2000) = 50x - 2000.\n2. If x > 50, P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (150(50) + 120(x - 50)) - (100x + 2000) = 7500 - 20x.\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of P(x) in each case and compare the profit values.\n\nCase 1: x ≤ 50\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = 50 (since P(x) is a linear function)\nThere are no critical points in this case as P'(x) is a constant.\n\nCase 2: x > 50\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = -20 (since P(x) is a linear function)\nThere are no critical points in this case as P'(x) is a constant.\n\nSince there are no critical points, we need to check the profit values at the boundary points (x = 50 and x > 50) and compare them to find the optimal number of units to produce.\n\n1. If x = 50, P(50) = 50(50) - 2000 = 2500 - 2000 = 500.\n2. If x > 50, let's check the profit for x = 51 (since it's the smallest integer greater than 50), P(51) = 7500 - 20(51) = 7500 - 1020 = 6480.\n\nComparing the profit values, we can see that the company should produce more than 50 units to maximize their profit. Since the profit function for x > 50 is a decreasing linear function (P'(x) = -20), the optimal number of units to produce is the smallest integer greater than 50, which is 51 units."
