    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total Gaussian curvature of a surface to its topological properties. For a flat surface like the one described, the Gaussian curvature is 0 everywhere. Therefore, the total Gaussian curvature of the surface is also 0.\n\nHowever, if you still want to apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, let's go through the process. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states:\n\n∫∫_M K dA = 2πχ(M)\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, dA is the area element, M is the surface, and χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nFor a flat surface, K = 0 everywhere, so the left side of the equation becomes:\n\n∫∫_M 0 dA = 0\n\nThe Euler characteristic χ(M) of a flat square surface is 1 (since it has 1 connected component, 4 vertices, 4 edges, and 1 face: χ(M) = 1 - 0 = 1). Therefore, the right side of the equation is:\n\n2πχ(M) = 2π(1) = 2π\n\nHowever, since K = 0 everywhere on the flat surface, the total Gaussian curvature is 0, and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem equation becomes:\n\n0 = 2π\n\nThis apparent contradiction is because the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is applicable to closed surfaces, while the flat square surface is not closed. In this case, the Gaussian curvature is 0 everywhere on the surface, and the total Gaussian curvature is also 0, as initially stated."
