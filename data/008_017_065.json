    "message_2": "Since the given system of linear equations is already in a sparse matrix form (also known as a triangular matrix), we can solve it using back-substitution.\n\nStarting with the last equation:\n```\n5z = 5\n```\nDivide both sides by 5:\n```\nz = 1\n```\n\nNow, substitute the value of z into the second equation:\n```\n3y - 9(1) = -12\n```\nSimplify:\n```\n3y - 9 = -12\n```\nAdd 9 to both sides:\n```\n3y = -3\n```\nDivide both sides by 3:\n```\ny = -1\n```\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z into the first equation:\n```\n4x - 2(-1) + 0(1) = 6\n```\nSimplify:\n```\n4x + 2 = 6\n```\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n```\n4x = 4\n```\nDivide both sides by 4:\n```\nx = 1\n```\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z are:\n```\nx = 1\ny = -1\nz = 1\n```"
