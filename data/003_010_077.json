    "message_1": "A flagpole stands on level ground. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is 53 degrees. If the distance between the point and the base of the pole is 25 meters, what is the height of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 53 degrees, the distance between the point and the base of the pole (adjacent side) is 25 meters, and the height of the flagpole (opposite side) is what we want to find.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(53°) = height / 25\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 25 * tan(53°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nheight ≈ 25 * 1.32704\n\nheight ≈ 33.176\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 33.176 meters."
