    "message_1": "Suppose you have a (10 x 10) matrix representing a message, and you want to encrypt it using a columnar transposition cipher. If the key for the cipher is 4-1-5-3-2, how many characters will be in the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "A (10 x 10) matrix has a total of 10 * 10 = 100 characters. When using a columnar transposition cipher, the number of characters in the encrypted message remains the same. Therefore, the encrypted message will also have 100 characters."
