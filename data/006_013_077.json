    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of a magnitude 6.0 or higher earthquake occurring in Los Angeles in the next 10 years, we can use historical data to calculate the average rate of such earthquakes and then apply the Poisson distribution to estimate the probability.\n\nStep 1: Gather historical data\nAccording to the Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC), there have been 5 earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or higher in the Los Angeles area since 1933. The years in which these earthquakes occurred are: 1933, 1971, 1987, 1991, and 1994.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average rate of earthquakes\nWe can calculate the average rate (λ) of magnitude 6.0 or higher earthquakes in the Los Angeles area by dividing the number of earthquakes by the number of years in the period.\n\nNumber of earthquakes = 5\nNumber of years in the period (1933-2021) = 2021 - 1933 = 88 years\n\nAverage rate (λ) = Number of earthquakes / Number of years = 5 / 88 ≈ 0.057 earthquakes per year\n\nStep 3: Apply the Poisson distribution\nThe Poisson distribution can be used to estimate the probability of a certain number of events (k) occurring in a fixed interval of time, given the average rate (λ) of events.\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(k; λ) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least one magnitude 6.0 or higher earthquake occurring in the next 10 years. To do this, we can first find the probability of no earthquakes occurring in the next 10 years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nk = 0 (no earthquakes)\nλ for 10 years = 0.057 earthquakes per year * 10 years = 0.57 earthquakes\n\nP(0; 0.57) = (e^(-0.57) * (0.57^0)) / 0! ≈ 0.566\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one earthquake occurring in the next 10 years:\n\nP(at least 1 earthquake) = 1 - P(0 earthquakes) = 1 - 0.566 ≈ 0.434\n\nSo, the probability of a magnitude 6.0 or higher earthquake occurring in Los Angeles in the next 10 years is approximately 43.4%."
