    "message_2": "Since the specific structure of the graph G is not provided, we cannot determine the exact cut vertices and bridges. However, we can provide definitions and general methods for finding cut vertices and bridges in a graph.\n\nA cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In other words, a cut vertex is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, disconnects the graph or increases the number of disconnected components.\n\nA bridge (also known as a cut edge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In other words, a bridge is an edge that, when removed, disconnects the graph or increases the number of disconnected components.\n\nTo find cut vertices and bridges in a graph, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the graph, keeping track of the discovery time and the low value of each vertex. The low value of a vertex is the smallest discovery time of all the vertices reachable from it, including itself.\n\n2. For each vertex, check if it is a cut vertex or if any of its incident edges are bridges:\n   a. If the vertex is the root of the DFS tree and has two or more children, it is a cut vertex.\n   b. If the vertex is not the root and has a child whose low value is greater than or equal to the discovery time of the vertex, it is a cut vertex.\n   c. If an edge connects two vertices with the low value of one vertex being greater than or equal to the discovery time of the other vertex, it is a bridge.\n\nWithout the specific structure of the graph G, we cannot provide the exact cut vertices and bridges. If you can provide the adjacency list or adjacency matrix of the graph, we can help you find the cut vertices and bridges."
