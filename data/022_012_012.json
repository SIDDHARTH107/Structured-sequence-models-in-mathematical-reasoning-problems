    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^2 + 1), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a difference of squares, so we can factor it as:\n\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two zeros:\n\nz = 1 and z = -1\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis equation has no real solutions, but it does have complex solutions:\n\nz^2 = -1\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nz = Â±i\n\nSo, the poles of the function are:\n\nz = i and z = -i\n\nIn summary, the meromorphic function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^2 + 1) has zeros at z = 1 and z = -1, and poles at z = i and z = -i on the complex plane."
