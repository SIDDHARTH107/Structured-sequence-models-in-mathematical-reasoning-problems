    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain product. The cost depends on the number of labor hours used and the amount of raw materials consumed. The cost function is given by \n\nC(x, y) = 12x + 8y + 0.01xy^2\n\nwhere x is the number of labor hours used and y is the amount of raw materials consumed. Using the firefly algorithm, find the values of x and y that will minimize the cost, subject to the constraints that 5 <= x <= 10 and 50 <= y <= 100.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of fireflies in nature. It is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, which means it is not guaranteed to find the global minimum but can provide good approximations in a reasonable amount of time. To apply the firefly algorithm to this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions within the given constraints (5 <= x <= 10 and 50 <= y <= 100).\n2. Define the attractiveness and brightness of each firefly based on the cost function C(x, y).\n3. Update the positions of the fireflies based on their attractiveness and brightness.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n5. Select the firefly with the lowest cost as the solution.\n\nHere, we will not implement the firefly algorithm from scratch but will provide an example of how to use an existing implementation in Python to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, install the \"niapy\" library, which provides an implementation of the firefly algorithm:\n\n```bash\npip install niapy\n```\n\nNext, create a Python script with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom niapy.algorithms.basic import FireflyAlgorithm\nfrom niapy.task import StoppingTask, OptimizationType\n\n# Define the cost function\ndef cost_function(x, y):\n    return 12 * x + 8 * y + 0.01 * x * y**2\n\n# Define the objective function for the firefly algorithm\ndef objective_function(solution):\n    x, y = solution\n    return cost_function(x, y)\n\n# Define the constraints for the problem\nlower_bounds = np.array([5, 50])\nupper_bounds = np.array([10, 100])\n\n# Create a stopping task with the objective function and constraints\ntask = StoppingTask(max_evals=10000,\n                    dimension=2,\n                    optimization_type=OptimizationType.MINIMIZATION,\n                    lower=lower_bounds,\n                    upper=upper_bounds,\n                    benchmark=objective_function)\n\n# Initialize the firefly algorithm\nalgorithm = FireflyAlgorithm()\n\n# Run the firefly algorithm on the task\nbest_solution, best_fitness = algorithm.run(task)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Best solution found: x = {:.2f}, y = {:.2f}\".format(best_solution[0], best_solution[1]))\nprint(\"Minimum cost: {:.2f}\".format(best_fitness))\n```\n\nThis script will run the firefly algorithm for 10,000 evaluations and print the best solution found. Note that the results may vary between runs due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm. You can experiment with different parameters and stopping criteria to find the best solution for your problem."
