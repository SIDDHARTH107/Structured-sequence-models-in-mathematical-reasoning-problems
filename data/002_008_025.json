    "message_2": "To find the volume of a right circular cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(7)²(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(49)(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)(3.14159)(490)\n\nVolume ≈ 1628.318 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the right circular cone is approximately 1628.318 cubic centimeters."
