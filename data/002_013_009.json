    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base that measures 10 cm by 15 cm, and a height of 20 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × Base Area × Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid is given by the product of its length and width:\n\nBase Area = Length × Width = 10 cm × 15 cm = 150 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 150 cm² × 20 cm = (1/3) × 3000 cm³ = 1000 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 1000 cubic centimeters."
