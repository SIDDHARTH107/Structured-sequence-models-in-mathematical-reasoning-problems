    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company in a given year is 0.02. If there are 500 companies in a certain region, what is the probability that at least 10 companies will experience this type of fraud in a given year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 10 companies will experience this type of fraud in a given year, we can use the binomial probability formula and then subtract the probabilities of having fewer than 10 cases of fraud from 1.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (fraud cases) out of n trials (companies)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (fraud) in a single trial (company), which is 0.02\n- n is the number of trials (companies), which is 500\n- k is the number of successes (fraud cases) we are interested in\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 10 cases of fraud, so we need to find the probability of having 0 to 9 cases of fraud and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(at least 10 frauds) = 1 - P(0 frauds) - P(1 fraud) - ... - P(9 frauds)\n\nWe can calculate each of these probabilities using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(500, k) * (0.02)^k * (0.98)^(500-k)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 9 and subtract their sum from 1:\n\nP(at least 10 frauds) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the probabilities and sum them up, we get:\n\nP(at least 10 frauds) ≈ 1 - 0.951 = 0.049\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 companies will experience this type of fraud in a given year is approximately 0.049, or 4.9%."
