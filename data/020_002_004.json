    "message_1": "A small tech company produces two types of laptops, basic and advanced. The basic laptop requires 6 hours of assembly time and 2 hours of software installation, while the advanced laptop requires 10 hours of assembly time and 5 hours of software installation. The company has 60 hours of assembly time and 20 hours of software installation available each day. The basic laptop sells for $600 and the advanced laptop sells for $1000. How many of each type of laptop should be produced each day to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of basic laptops produced each day and y be the number of advanced laptops produced each day.\n\nThe constraints for assembly time and software installation time can be represented as:\n\n6x + 10y ≤ 60 (assembly time constraint)\n2x + 5y ≤ 20 (software installation constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 600x + 1000y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n6x + 10y ≤ 60\ny ≤ (60 - 6x) / 10\ny ≤ 6 - 0.6x\n\n2x + 5y ≤ 20\ny ≤ (20 - 2x) / 5\ny ≤ 4 - 0.4x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 4), (5, 2), and (10, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 600(0) + 1000(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 4) = 600(0) + 1000(4) = $4000\n3. P(5, 2) = 600(5) + 1000(2) = $5000\n4. P(10, 0) = 600(10) + 1000(0) = $6000\n\nThe maximum profit of $6000 is achieved when the company produces 10 basic laptops and 0 advanced laptops each day."
