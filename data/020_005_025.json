    "message_1": "A small toy factory produces two types of wooden cars, sedan and SUV. The factory can produce up to 30 cars each day, and it takes 2 hours to produce a sedan and 3 hours to produce an SUV. The profit per sedan is $30 and per SUV is $45. However, the factory can only produce a maximum of 50 cars each week.\n\nWrite an integer programming problem to determine the number of sedans and SUVs to be produced in order to maximize the profit for the factory.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of sedans and y be the number of SUVs produced.\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize profit P = 30x + 45y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Daily production limit: x + y ≤ 30\n2. Weekly production limit: x + y ≤ 50\n3. Time constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 60 (assuming the factory works 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, so 60 hours a week)\n4. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n5.
