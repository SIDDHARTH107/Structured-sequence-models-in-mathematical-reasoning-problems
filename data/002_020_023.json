    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 cm and the central angle is 45 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (45 / 360) × 2π(7)\nArc length = (1/8) × 14π\nArc length = 7π/4 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = (7π/4) + 2(7)\nPerimeter = (7π/4) + 14\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (7π/4) + 14 cm."
