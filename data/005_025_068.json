    "message_2": "To construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean GPA of college students, we will use the following formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (3.2)\nZ = Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\nσ = standard deviation (0.5)\nn = sample size (100)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 0.5 / √100 = 0.5 / 10 = 0.05\n\nNext, we will calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.05 = 0.098\n\nNow, we can construct the 95% confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± ME = 3.2 ± 0.098\n\nLower limit of the CI = 3.2 - 0.098 = 3.102\nUpper limit of the CI = 3.2 + 0.098 = 3.298\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean GPA of college students is (3.102, 3.298), and the margin of error is 0.098."
