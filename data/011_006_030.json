    "message_2": "To find the generating function for the number of ways to choose 3 balls from the box such that at least 1 ball is red, we can use the generating functions for each color of balls and then combine them.\n\nLet R(x) be the generating function for the red balls, B(x) for the blue balls, and G(x) for the green balls.\n\nSince there are 5 red balls, the generating function for the red balls is:\nR(x) = 1 + 5x\n\nThere are 4 blue balls, so the generating function for the blue balls is:\nB(x) = 1 + 4x\n\nThere are 3 green balls, so the generating function for the green balls is:\nG(x) = 1 + 3x\n\nNow, we want to find the generating function for choosing 3 balls with at least 1 red ball. We can find the generating function for choosing 3 balls without any restrictions and then subtract the generating function for choosing 3 balls with no red balls.\n\nThe generating function for choosing 3 balls without any restrictions is given by the product of the individual generating functions:\n(R(x) * B(x) * G(x)) = (1 + 5x)(1 + 4x)(1 + 3x)\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n(1 + 5x)(1 + 4x)(1 + 3x) = (1 + 9x + 20x^2 + 60x^3)\n\nNow, we find the generating function for choosing 3 balls with no red balls. This is given by the product of the generating functions for the blue and green balls:\n(B(x) * G(x)) = (1 + 4x)(1 + 3x)\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n(1 + 4x)(1 + 3x) = (1 + 7x + 12x^2)\n\nNow, we subtract the generating function for choosing 3 balls with no red balls from the generating function for choosing 3 balls without any restrictions to get the generating function for choosing 3 balls with at least 1 red ball:\n\n(1 + 9x + 20x^2 + 60x^3) - (1 + 7x + 12x^2) = 2x + 8x^2 + 60x^3\n\nSo, the generating function for the number of ways to choose 3 balls from the box such that at least 1 ball is red is:\n\n2x + 8x^2 + 60x^3"
