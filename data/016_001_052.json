    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a Sierpinski triangle can be determined using the formula:\n\nDimension = log(N) / log(r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor a Sierpinski triangle, there are 3 self-similar pieces (the three smaller triangles), and the scaling factor is 2 (each side length of the smaller triangles is half the side length of the original triangle).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nDimension = log(3) / log(2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nDimension â‰ˆ 1.58\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of a Sierpinski triangle with a side length of 4 units is approximately 1.58."
