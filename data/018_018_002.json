    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection: A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nFor sets A and B given:\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nB = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nFirst, let's find the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {} (since A and B have no common elements)\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference of sets A and B (A Δ B):\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, to prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative, we need to show that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference of sets B and A (B Δ A):\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nWe already know that A ∪ B = B ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and A ∩ B = B ∩ A = {}.\n\nSo, B Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSince A Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and B Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, we can conclude that A Δ B = B Δ A. Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative."
