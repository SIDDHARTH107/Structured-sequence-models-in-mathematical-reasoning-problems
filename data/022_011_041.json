    "message_1": "What are the poles and zeros of the following complex function $f(z) = \\frac{2z^3 - 3z^2 + 4z - 6}{z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - 4z + 4}$ and what is their order?",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n$2z^3 - 3z^2 + 4z - 6 = 0$\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. We can see that z = 1 is a root:\n\n$2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 6 = 0$\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n$(2z^3 - 3z^2 + 4z - 6) / (z - 1) = 2z^2 - z + 6$\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z - 1)(2z^2 - z + 6)}{z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - 4z + 4}$\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor does not have any rational roots, and we can use the quadratic formula to find its complex roots:\n\n$z = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(2)(6)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-47}}{4}$\n\nSo, the zeros of the function are $z = 1$, $z = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{-47}}{4}$, and $z = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-47}}{4}$, all with order 1.\n\nTo find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - 4z + 4 = 0$\n\nWe can see that z = 2 is a root:\n\n$(2)^4 - (2)^3 + (2)^2 - 4(2) + 4 = 0$\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to find the remaining cubic factor:\n\n$(z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - 4z + 4) / (z - 2) = z^3 + z^2 - 3z + 2$\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{2z^3 - 3z^2 + 4z - 6}{(z - 2)(z^3 + z^2 - 3z + 2)}$\n\nThe remaining cubic factor does not have any rational roots, and finding its complex roots can be challenging. However, since the question asks for the poles and their order, we can say that there is a pole at $z = 2$ with order 1. The remaining cubic factor contributes to the other poles, but their exact values are not easily determined."
