    "message_1": "Given an image with a function f(x,y), applying the Fourier transform results in the function F(u,v). If the image has a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels, and the Fourier transform results in a resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels, what is the size of the original image in terms of physical dimensions (assuming a square image)?",
    "message_2": "To determine the size of the original image in terms of physical dimensions, we need to know the size of each pixel. Unfortunately, the information provided does not include the size of each pixel or any information about the physical dimensions of the image. \n\nIf you can provide the size of each pixel or the physical dimensions of the image, we can calculate the size of the original image."
