    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(x + 5) - 2 = 3, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the radical term.\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation to isolate the radical term:\n\n√(x + 5) = 5\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation.\nSquaring both sides will eliminate the square root:\n\n(√(x + 5))^2 = 5^2\n\nx + 5 = 25\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 25 - 5\nx = 20\n\nThe solution to the radical equation √(x + 5) - 2 = 3 is x = 20."
