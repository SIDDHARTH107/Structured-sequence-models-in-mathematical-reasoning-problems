In this problem, you can start by creating a tree decomposition of the given graph and calculate its width.",
    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph with the minimum width. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices of the graph, and the tree satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the set of bags containing v forms a connected subtree.\n\nNow, let's create a tree decomposition of the given graph:\n\n```\n  Bag 1: A, B, E\n  Bag 2: B, C, E\n  Bag 3: B, C, D\n  Bag 4: C, D, G\n  Bag 5: C, F, G\n  Bag 6: E, F, G\n\n  Tree structure:\n    1 - 2 - 3 - 4\n        |       |\n        6 - 5 - 4\n```\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case, the largest bag contains 3 vertices, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2. Therefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
