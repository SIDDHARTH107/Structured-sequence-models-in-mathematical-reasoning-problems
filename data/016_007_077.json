    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from the initial cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed, leaving 20 smaller cubes.\n\nThe surface area of the initial cube (0th iteration) is given by the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 * side^2\n\nFor the initial cube with a side length of 3 units, the surface area is:\n\nSurface area = 6 * 3^2 = 6 * 9 = 54 square units\n\nIn the first iteration, 20 smaller cubes are left, each with a side length of 1 unit (3/3). The total surface area after the first iteration is:\n\nSurface area = 20 * 6 * 1^2 = 120 square units\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the 20 smaller cubes is replaced by 20 even smaller cubes, resulting in 20^2 = 400 cubes, each with a side length of 1/3 units (1/3). The total surface area after the second iteration is:\n\nSurface area = 400 * 6 * (1/3)^2 = 240 square units\n\nIn the third iteration, each of the 400 smaller cubes is replaced by 20 even smaller cubes, resulting in 20^3 = 8000 cubes, each with a side length of 1/9 units (1/9). The total surface area after the third iteration is:\n\nSurface area = 8000 * 6 * (1/9)^2 = 480 square units\n\nIn the fourth iteration, each of the 8000 smaller cubes is replaced by 20 even smaller cubes, resulting in 20^4 = 160000 cubes, each with a side length of 1/27 units (1/27). The total surface area after the fourth iteration is:\n\nSurface area = 160000 * 6 * (1/27)^2 = 960 square units\n\nSo, the surface area of a Menger sponge after the 4th iteration, given that the initial cube has a side length of 3 units, is 960 square units."
