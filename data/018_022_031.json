    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the Cartesian product of A and B. Finally, show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product by finding the Cartesian product of B and A and comparing the results.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1}\nB - A = {4}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A. \n\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nComparing the results of A × B and B × A, we can see that the ordered pairs are different. The Cartesian product is not commutative, as swapping the order of the sets A and B changes the ordered pairs in the product. \n\nA × B ≠ B × A\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
