Using calculus, find the maximum height the ball rises above the building and the time it takes to reach that height. Also, find the velocity and acceleration of the ball 3 seconds after it is thrown. (Assume acceleration due to gravity is -32 feet per second squared.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the following kinematic equations:\n\n1. Position equation: s(t) = s0 + v0*t + (1/2)*a*t^2\n2. Velocity equation: v(t) = v0 + a*t\n3. Acceleration equation: a(t) = a (constant)\n\nwhere s(t) is the position of the ball at time t, s0 is the initial position, v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time.\n\nGiven:\ns0 = 50 feet\nv0 = 64 feet/second\na = -32 feet/second^2\n\nFirst, we will find the time it takes to reach the maximum height. At the maximum height, the velocity of the ball will be 0. Using the velocity equation:\n\n0 = 64 + (-32)*t\n32*t = 64\nt = 2 seconds\n\nNow, we will find the maximum height by plugging the time into the position equation:\n\ns(2) = 50 + 64*2 + (1/2)*(-32)*2^2\ns(2) = 50 + 128 - 64\ns(2) = 114 feet\n\nThe maximum height the ball rises above the building is 114 feet, and it takes 2 seconds to reach that height.\n\nNext, we will find the velocity and acceleration of the ball 3 seconds after it is thrown. Using the velocity equation:\n\nv(3) = 64 + (-32)*3\nv(3) = 64 - 96\nv(3) = -32 feet/second\n\nThe velocity of the ball 3 seconds after it is thrown is -32 feet/second (negative sign indicates downward direction).\n\nSince the acceleration due to gravity is constant, the acceleration of the ball 3 seconds after it is thrown is the same as the given acceleration:\n\na(3) = -32 feet/second^2\n\nIn summary, the maximum height the ball rises above the building is 114 feet, and it takes 2 seconds to reach that height. The velocity of the ball 3 seconds after it is thrown is -32 feet/second, and the acceleration is -32 feet/second^2."
