    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors P and Q, we can use the following formula:\n\nP x Q = (P_y * Q_z - P_z * Q_y, P_z * Q_x - P_x * Q_z, P_x * Q_y - P_y * Q_x)\n\nGiven the vectors P = (-2, 3, 4) and Q = (5, -1, 2), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP x Q = (3 * 2 - 4 * (-1), 4 * 5 - (-2) * 2, (-2) * (-1) - 3 * 5)\n\nP x Q = (6 + 4, 20 + 4, 2 - 15)\n\nP x Q = (10, 24, -13)\n\nSo, the cross product of the vectors P and Q is (10, 24, -13)."
