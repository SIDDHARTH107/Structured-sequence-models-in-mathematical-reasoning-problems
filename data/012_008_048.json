    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges. Can you identify whether this graph is planar or not using Euler's formula? If yes, explain how you did it. If not, explain why.",
    "message_2": "Yes, we can use Euler's formula to determine if the given graph is planar or not. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn this case, we have V = 8 and E = 12. We want to find out if there exists a value for F such that the equation holds true.\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to find F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nNow, plug in the values for V and E:\n\nF = 2 - 8 + 12\nF = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 faces in the graph if it is planar. However, we need to check if this graph satisfies the condition for planarity using the inequality derived from Euler's formula:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for V and E:\n\n12 ≤ 3(8) - 6\n12 ≤ 18\n\nSince the inequality holds true, the given graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges can be planar."
