    "message_2": "To determine who is correct, we need to analyze the graph G with 7 vertices and 10 edges. First, let's recall some definitions:\n\nA vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. The minimum vertex cover is the vertex cover with the smallest possible number of vertices.\n\nIn a complete graph with n vertices, the number of edges is given by the formula:\n\nEdges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nFor our graph with 7 vertices, the maximum number of edges in a complete graph would be:\n\nEdges = 7 * (7 - 1) / 2 = 7 * 6 / 2 = 21\n\nSince our graph has 10 edges, it is not a complete graph. Now, let's consider the minimum vertex cover.\n\nAccording to Kőnig's theorem, in a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching. A bipartite graph can be divided into two sets of vertices, U and V, such that every edge connects a vertex in U to a vertex in V.\n\nLet's assume the graph is bipartite. If the graph has a maximum matching of size 3, then by Kőnig's theorem, the minimum vertex cover would also have size 3, and Student B would be correct. However, if the maximum matching has size 4 or more, then the minimum vertex cover would have size 4 or more, and Student A would be correct.\n\nSince we don't have information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot definitively say which student is correct. However, we can say that if the graph is bipartite and has a maximum matching of size 3, then Student B is correct; otherwise, Student A is correct."
