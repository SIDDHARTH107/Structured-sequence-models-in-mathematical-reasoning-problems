    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$, we can use the long exact sequence in cohomology associated to the short exact sequence of sheaves on $X$:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathcal{O}_X(-3) \\to \\mathcal{O}_X \\to \\mathcal{O}_X(3) \\to 0$$\n\nThis short exact sequence comes from the fact that the equation defining $X$ is homogeneous of degree 3. Now, we can apply the long exact sequence in cohomology:\n\n$$\\cdots \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-3)) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3)) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-3)) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3)) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nWe know that $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-3)) = 0$ because there are no global sections of negative degree on a projective variety. Also, $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\mathbb{C}$ because the only global regular functions on a projective variety are constants. \n\nTo compute $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3))$, we need to find the global sections of degree 3 on $X$. These are given by the homogeneous polynomials of degree 3 in the variables $x, y, z$. There are $\\binom{3+3-1}{3} = 10$ such polynomials, so $\\dim H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3)) = 10$.\n\nNow, we can use the long exact sequence to compute the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3)) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-3)) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3))$$\n\nSince the map $\\mathbb{C} \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3))$ is injective, we have $\\dim H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-3)) = 10 - 1 = 9$. \n\nFinally, we need to compute the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3))$. By Serre duality, we have:\n\n$$H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3)) \\cong H^0(X, \\omega_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_X(-3))^*$$\n\nSince $X$ is a cubic curve, it is a smooth curve of genus 1, and its canonical bundle is isomorphic to the structure sheaf, i.e., $\\omega_X \\cong \\mathcal{O}_X$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3)) \\cong H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-3))^*$$\n\nAs we already know, $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-3)) = 0$, so $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3)) = 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$:\n\n$$\\dim H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\dim H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-3)) - \\dim H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(3)) = 9 - 0 = 9$$\n\nTherefore, the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$ is 9."
