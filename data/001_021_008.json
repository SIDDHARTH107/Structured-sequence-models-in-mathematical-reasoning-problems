    "message_2": "To find all the roots of the given polynomial equation 3x^3 + 7x^2 - 5x - 9 = 0, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to find a potential rational root, and then perform polynomial division to reduce the polynomial to a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the Quadratic Formula.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -9 and the leading coefficient is 3. The possible factors of -9 are ±1, ±3, ±9, and the possible factors of 3 are ±1, ±3. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±3, ±9, ±1/3, ±3/3, and ±9/3.\n\nWe can test these possible rational roots by substituting them into the polynomial equation:\n\n1. For x = 1: 3(1)^3 + 7(1)^2 - 5(1) - 9 = 3 + 7 - 5 - 9 = -4 ≠ 0\n2. For x = -1: 3(-1)^3 + 7(-1)^2 - 5(-1) - 9 = -3 + 7 + 5 - 9 = 0\n\nSince x = -1 is a root of the polynomial, we can now perform synthetic division to find the quotient:\n\n      _________________________\n-1 |  3      7      -5      -9\n         -3      4       1\n      _________________________\n         3      4      -1      -8\n\nThe quotient is 3x^2 + 4x - 1. Now, we can use the Quadratic Formula to find the remaining roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 4, and c = -1.\n\nx = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(3)(-1))) / 2(3)\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 12)) / 6\nx = (-4 ± √28) / 6\n\nThe two remaining roots are x = (-4 + √28) / 6 and x = (-4 - √28) / 6.\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation 3x^3 + 7x^2 - 5x - 9 = 0 are x = -1, x = (-4 + √28) / 6, and x = (-4 - √28) / 6."
