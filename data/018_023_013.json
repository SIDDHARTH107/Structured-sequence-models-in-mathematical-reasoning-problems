    "message_1": "Suppose A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Let C = {(1, a), (2, b), (3, c), (4, d)} be a set of ordered pairs where a, b, c, and d are real numbers. Calculate the following:\n\n1) (A △ B) △ C\n2) A △ (B △ C)\n3) Is the result of (1) and (2) the same?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B. The symmetric difference (△) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, A △ B = {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's calculate (1):\n\n1) (A △ B) △ C\n\nSince A △ B = {1, 4}, we need to find the symmetric difference between this set and C. The set C contains ordered pairs, while A △ B contains single elements. To find the symmetric difference, we will consider the set of the first elements of the ordered pairs in C, which is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Now, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\n({1, 4} △ {1, 2, 3, 4}) = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's calculate (2):\n\n2) A △ (B △ C)\n\nFirst, we need to find B △ C. As before, we will consider the set of the first elements of the ordered pairs in C, which is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Now, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\n({2, 3, 4} △ {1, 2, 3, 4}) = {1}\n\nNow, we can find A △ (B △ C):\n\n({1, 2, 3} △ {1}) = {2, 3}\n\nFinally, let's answer (3):\n\n3) Is the result of (1) and (2) the same?\n\nThe result of (1) is {2, 3}, and the result of (2) is {2, 3}. Therefore, the results are the same."
