    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nA particle moves along the x-axis under the influence of a force given by F(x) = 3x^2 - 6x - 9. Find the work done by the force in moving the particle from x = 1 to x = 4.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force in moving the particle from x = 1 to x = 4, we need to calculate the integral of the force function F(x) with respect to x over the interval [1, 4]. \n\nThe work done (W) can be found using the formula:\n\nW = ∫[F(x) dx] from x = 1 to x = 4\n\nGiven F(x) = 3x^2 - 6x - 9, we first need to find the antiderivative of F(x):\n\n∫[F(x) dx] = ∫[3x^2 - 6x - 9 dx] = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n\nW = [x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x] from x = 1 to x = 4\n\nW = (4^3 - 3(4^2) - 9(4)) - (1^3 - 3(1^2) - 9(1))\nW = (64 - 48 - 36) - (1 - 3 - 9)\nW = (-20) - (-11)\nW = 11\n\nSo, the work done by the force in moving the particle from x = 1 to x = 4 is 11 units."
