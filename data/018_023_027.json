    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nSo, A Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and {(1,0), (2,0), (3,0)}. \n\n(A Δ B) Δ {(1,0), (2,0), (3,0)}\n\nSince the elements in (A Δ B) and {(1,0), (2,0), (3,0)} are not of the same type (numbers vs. ordered pairs), we cannot directly compute the symmetric difference. \n\nHowever, we can deduce that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set. The symmetric difference operation does not preserve the structure of the Cartesian product, as it only considers elements that are unique to each set and not their ordered pair combinations.\n\nIn conclusion, the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
