    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter (d)\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 14 centimeters, we can plug it into the formula:\n\nC = π * 14\n\nUsing the value of π as approximately 3.14159:\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 14\nC ≈ 44.0 centimeters\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 44.0 centimeters."
