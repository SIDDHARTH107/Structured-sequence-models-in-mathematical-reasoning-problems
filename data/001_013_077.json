    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x-3) = 5, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n\n(√(2x-3))^2 = 5^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x - 3 = 25\n\nNow, we will isolate the variable x by adding 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 28\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 14\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(2x-3) = 5 is x = 14."
