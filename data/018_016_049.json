    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)}\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2)}\n\n(B x A) U (A x B) = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)}\n\nAs you can see, (A x B) U (B x A) and (B x A) U (A x B) are equal, which means that the union operation is commutative. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product operation is commutative, as A x B and B x A are not equal:\n\nA x B â‰  B x A\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union. The union operation is commutative, but the Cartesian product operation itself is not."
