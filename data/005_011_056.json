    "message_1": "A company wants to test two different brands of laundry detergent to see which one gets clothes cleaner. They randomly assign 50 identical pieces of clothing to two groups. The first group will be washed in Brand A and the second group will be washed in Brand B. After washing the clothes, the company measures the amount of dirt removed from each piece of clothing on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the cleanest. The results are recorded in the table below:\n\n|  Brand A  |  Brand B  |\n|:--------:|:---------:|\n|    5     |     7     |\n|    6     |     8     |\n|    7     |     6     |\n|    9     |     7     |\n|    6     |     5     |\n|    8     |     6     |\n|    7     |     5     |\n|    5     |     8     |\n|    6     |     7     |\n|    8     |     6     |\n\nWhat is the mean dirt removed for Brand A and what is the mean dirt removed for Brand B? Based on these sample results, which brand of detergent appears to be better at removing dirt?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean dirt removed for each brand, we need to add up the dirt removed for each piece of clothing and divide by the total number of pieces of clothing for each brand.\n\nFor Brand A:\nMean = (5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 8) / 10\nMean = 67 / 10\nMean = 6.7\n\nFor Brand B:\nMean = (7 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 7 + 6) / 10\nMean = 65 / 10\nMean = 6.5\n\nBased on these sample results, Brand A has a higher mean dirt removed (6.7) compared to Brand B (6.5). Therefore, Brand A appears to be better at removing dirt."
