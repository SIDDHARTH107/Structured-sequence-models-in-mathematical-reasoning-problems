    "message_1": "A cube has a length of 8 cm. What is the total surface area of the cube in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and the area of each face is the square of the length of its side. Since the length of each side is 8 cm, the area of each face is 8 * 8 = 64 square centimeters. To find the total surface area of the cube, multiply the area of one face by the number of faces: 64 * 6 = 384 square centimeters."
