    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the given function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe given function is y = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 4.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^3)/dx - d(2x^2)/dx + d(3x)/dx - d(4)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, let's evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 3(2)^2 - 4(2) + 3\ndy/dx(2) = 3(4) - 8 + 3\ndy/dx(2) = 12 - 8 + 3\ndy/dx(2) = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at x = 2 is 7."
