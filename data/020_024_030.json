    "message_1": "A company produces a product at a cost of $50 per unit. The demand function for the product is given by Q = 100 - 2P, where P is the price per unit and Q is the quantity demanded. Find the optimal price the company should charge to maximize their revenue.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize revenue, we need to find the price at which the revenue function R(P) is maximized. Revenue is calculated as the product of price and quantity, so we have:\n\nR(P) = P * Q(P)\n\nWe are given the demand function Q(P) = 100 - 2P. Substituting this into the revenue function, we get:\n\nR(P) = P * (100 - 2P)\n\nNow we need to find the maximum of this function. To do this, we can take the derivative of R(P) with respect to P and set it equal to 0:\n\ndR(P)/dP = 100 - 4P\n\nSetting this equal to 0, we get:\n\n100 - 4P = 0\n\nSolving for P, we find:\n\n4P = 100\nP = 25\n\nSo the optimal price the company should charge to maximize their revenue is $25 per unit."
