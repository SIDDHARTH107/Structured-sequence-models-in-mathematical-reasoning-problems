    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg duopoly model where Firm A is the leader and Firm B is the follower. The inverse demand function is given by P = 100 - 2Q. The cost function for Firm A is C_A(Q_A) = 10Q_A, and for Firm B it is C_B(Q_B) = 20Q_B. Determine the quantity produced by each firm and the corresponding profits.",
    "message_2": "To determine the quantity produced by each firm and their corresponding profits, we first need to find the reaction function for Firm B (the follower). The reaction function shows the optimal quantity produced by Firm B given the quantity produced by Firm A.\n\n1. First, we find the revenue function for Firm B:\nR_B(Q_A, Q_B) = P * Q_B = (100 - 2(Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_B\n\n2. Next, we find the profit function for Firm B:\nΠ_B(Q_A, Q_B) = R_B(Q_A, Q_B) - C_B(Q_B) = (100 - 2(Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_B - 20Q_B\n\n3. Now, we find the first-order condition for Firm B's profit maximization with respect to Q_B:\ndΠ_B(Q_A, Q_B) / dQ_B = 0\n\n4. Solving the first-order condition, we get Firm B's reaction function:\nQ_B = (40 - Q_A) / 2\n\nNow, we find the optimal quantity produced by Firm A (the leader) by taking into account Firm B's reaction function.\n\n5. Substitute Firm B's reaction function into the inverse demand function:\nP = 100 - 2(Q_A + (40 - Q_A) / 2)\n\n6. Find the revenue function for Firm A:\nR_A(Q_A) = P * Q_A = (100 - 2(Q_A + (40 - Q_A) / 2)) * Q_A\n\n7. Find the profit function for Firm A:\nΠ_A(Q_A) = R_A(Q_A) - C_A(Q_A) = (100 - 2(Q_A + (40 - Q_A) / 2)) * Q_A - 10Q_A\n\n8. Find the first-order condition for Firm A's profit maximization with respect to Q_A:\ndΠ_A(Q_A) / dQ_A = 0\n\n9. Solving the first-order condition, we get the optimal quantity produced by Firm A:\nQ_A = 20\n\n10. Substitute Q_A into Firm B's reaction function to find the optimal quantity produced by Firm B:\nQ_B = (40 - 20) / 2 = 10\n\nNow, we have the optimal quantities produced by both firms: Q_A = 20 and Q_B = 10.\n\nFinally, we find the corresponding profits for each firm:\n\n11. Firm A's profit:\nΠ_A = (100 - 2(Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_A - 10Q_A = (100 - 2(20 + 10)) * 20 - 10 * 20 = 20 * 30 = 600\n\n12. Firm B's profit:\nΠ_B = (100 - 2(Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_B - 20Q_B = (100 - 2(20 + 10)) * 10 - 20 * 10 = 10 * 10 = 100\n\nIn conclusion, Firm A produces 20 units and earns a profit of 600, while Firm B produces 10 units and earns a profit of 100."
