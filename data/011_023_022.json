    "message_2": "In a simple graph with 6 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3, it must be a complete bipartite graph K(3,3). This is because if it were a complete graph with 6 vertices (K6), each vertex would have a degree of 5, which is not the case here.\n\nA complete bipartite graph K(3,3) can be colored using 2 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is because the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, with each vertex in one set connected to all vertices in the other set. By coloring all vertices in one set with one color and all vertices in the other set with a different color, we can ensure that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nSo, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 2."
