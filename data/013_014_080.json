    "message_1": "Consider an auction mechanism for selling an item where there are three bidders: A, B, and C. The bidders have the following valuations for the item: A values the item at $1000, B values the item at $800, and C values the item at $1200. \n\nThe auction mechanism works as follows: each bidder submits a sealed bid for the item, and the highest bidder wins the item at a price equal to the second-highest bid. If there is a tie for the highest bid, the winner is decided uniformly at random. \n\nWhat is the expected revenue for the seller under this auction mechanism?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected revenue for the seller, we need to consider all possible scenarios of bids and their probabilities. Let's assume that each bidder bids their true valuation for the item. In this case, there are three possible outcomes:\n\n1. A wins the auction with a bid of $1000, B is the second-highest bidder with a bid of $800, and C loses with a bid of $1200. The probability of this outcome is 0, as C's bid is higher than A's bid.\n\n2. B wins the auction with a bid of $800, A is the second-highest bidder with a bid of $1000, and C loses with a bid of $1200. The probability of this outcome is 0, as C's bid is higher than B's bid.\n\n3. C wins the auction with a bid of $1200, A is the second-highest bidder with a bid of $1000, and B loses with a bid of $800. The probability of this outcome is 1, as C's bid is the highest.\n\nIn the only possible outcome, the seller's revenue is equal to the second-highest bid, which is $1000. Therefore, the expected revenue for the seller under this auction mechanism is $1000."
