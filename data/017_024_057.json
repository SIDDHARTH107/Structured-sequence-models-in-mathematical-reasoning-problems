    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we will first analyze the structure of G using Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 96, which can be factored as 2^5 * 3. Thus, we have the following Sylow subgroups:\n\n- A 2-Sylow subgroup, P, of order 2^5 = 32\n- A 3-Sylow subgroup, Q, of order 3\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, divides 2^5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G, and G is a direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q have coprime orders, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C96.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 or n_3 = 4\nIn this case, either P or Q is not a normal subgroup of G. We can't conclude that G is isomorphic to C96. We will now check if G is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nThe group A4 × C4 × C2 has the following properties:\n1. It is non-abelian.\n2. It has a normal subgroup of order 4 (C4).\n3. It has a normal subgroup of order 2 (C2).\n\nWe will now analyze the structure of G to see if it has these properties.\n\n1. Non-abelian: If G has a non-normal Sylow subgroup, it is non-abelian.\n2. Normal subgroup of order 4: If n_2 = 3, then G has a normal subgroup of index 3, which is of order 32. By the correspondence theorem, G has a normal subgroup of order 4.\n3. Normal subgroup of order 2: If n_3 = 4, then G has a normal subgroup of index 4, which is of order 24. By the correspondence theorem, G has a normal subgroup of order 2.\n\nThus, if G has either n_2 = 3 or n_3 = 4, it has the same properties as A4 × C4 × C2. However, this does not guarantee that G is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2. It could still be one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C96 if both 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are normal (case 1). If either n_2 = 3 or n_3 = 4 (case 2), G has the same properties as A4 × C4 × C2, but we cannot guarantee that G is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2. In this case, G could be one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96."
