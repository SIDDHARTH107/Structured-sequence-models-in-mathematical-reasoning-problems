    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix multiplication, we first need to write the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n3x - 2y = 5\n4x + 7y = 15\n2x + y = 4\n\nThe matrix form is:\n\nA = | 3 -2 |\n    | 4  7 |\n    | 2  1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  5  |\n    | 15  |\n    |  4  |\n\nNow we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv) and then multiply it with matrix B to get the matrix X.\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nThe determinant of A (det(A)) is not possible to calculate since A is a 3x2 matrix. The inverse of a matrix is only possible for square matrices (i.e., matrices with the same number of rows and columns). \n\nIn this case, we can use other methods to solve the system of linear equations, such as the Gaussian elimination method or the Cramer's rule. However, using matrix multiplication is not possible for this particular system of linear equations."
