    "message_1": "A right circular cone has a radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 13 cm. What is the surface area of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle with a radius of 5 cm. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nA_base = π(5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cone is given by the formula A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height.\n\nA_lateral = π(5 cm)(13 cm) = 65π cm²\n\nNow, we add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cone:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 25π cm² + 65π cm² = 90π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 90π cm²."
