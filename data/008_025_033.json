    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we first need to check if it has no solutions, one solution, or infinitely many solutions. We can do this by comparing the coefficients of the two equations.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n1. x + 2y = 8\n2. 2x + 4y = -16\n\nWe can see that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2:\n\n2(x + 2y) = 2(8)\n2x + 4y = -16\n\nHowever, the right-hand side of the second equation should be 2(8) = 16, not -16. This means that the two equations are not proportional and are therefore inconsistent, which means the system has no solutions."
