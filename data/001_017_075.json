    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(base 3) (x-1) + log(base 3) (x+2) = log(base 3) 45, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation using the product rule of logarithms, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b):\n\nlog(base 3) [(x-1)(x+2)] = log(base 3) 45\n\nNow, since the bases of the logarithms are the same, we can equate the expressions inside the logarithms:\n\n(x-1)(x+2) = 45\n\nNext, we expand the left side of the equation:\n\nx^2 + 2x - x - 2 = 45\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 + x - 2 = 45\n\nSubtract 45 from both sides to set the equation to 0:\n\nx^2 + x - 47 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation. Unfortunately, it does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -47. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4(1)(-47))) / 2(1)\nx = (-1 ± √(1 + 188)) / 2\nx = (-1 ± √189) / 2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (-1 + √189) / 2 and x = (-1 - √189) / 2"
