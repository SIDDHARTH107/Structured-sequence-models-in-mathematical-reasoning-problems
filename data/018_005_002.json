    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A (denoted as A'), we need to know the universal set (denoted as U) that A is a subset of. The universal set contains all the elements under consideration for a specific problem. Since the universal set is not provided, we cannot determine the exact elements of A'.\n\nHowever, we can still determine the intersection of A and A'. By definition, the complement of a set contains all the elements that are not in the original set. Therefore, there are no elements that are both in A and A'. So, the intersection of A and A' is an empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅"
