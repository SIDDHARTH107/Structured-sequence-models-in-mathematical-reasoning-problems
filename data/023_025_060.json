    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5, we use the following formula:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the entire real line.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5, so we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[(3x^2 - 4x + 5) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can break it into three separate integrals:\n\nF(k) = 3∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx - 4∫[x * e^(-2πikx)] dx + 5∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nNow, we can solve each integral separately:\n\n1) ∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\nUsing integration by parts twice, we get:\n\nu = x^2, dv = e^(-2πikx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)\n\n∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx = (-x^2/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - ∫[(-2x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts again:\n\nu = x, dv = (-2/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) dx\ndu = dx, v = (1/(2πik)^2) * e^(-2πikx)\n\n∫[(-2x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx = (x/(2πik)^2) * e^(-2πikx) - ∫[(1/(2πik)^2) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nSo, the first integral becomes:\n\n(-x^2/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - (x/(2πik)^2) * e^(-2πikx) + (1/(2πik)^3) * e^(-2πikx)\n\n2) ∫[x * e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\nu = x, dv = e^(-2πikx) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)\n\n∫[x * e^(-2πikx)] dx = (-x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) + ∫[(1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nSo, the second integral becomes:\n\n(-x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - (1/(2πik)^2) * e^(-2πikx)\n\n3) ∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\nThis integral is straightforward:\n\n∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx = (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)\n\nNow, we can combine the three integrals to find the Fourier transform F(k):\n\nF(k) = 3[(-x^2/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - (x/(2πik)^2) * e^(-2πikx) + (1/(2πik)^3) * e^(-2πikx)] - 4[(-x/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - (1/(2πik)^2) * e^(-2πikx)] + 5[(-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx)]\n\nTo determine the frequency components of the material sample, we need to analyze the Fourier transform F(k). However, the Fourier transform of a polynomial function does not have a simple closed-form expression that can be easily analyzed for frequency components.\n\nIn practice, for a material sample with a similar structure to the function, one would typically use numerical methods (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform) to compute the Fourier transform and analyze the frequency components. Additionally, the length and density of the material sample would be used to determine the physical properties of the sample, such as its mass and volume, but these properties are not directly related to the frequency components of the sample."
