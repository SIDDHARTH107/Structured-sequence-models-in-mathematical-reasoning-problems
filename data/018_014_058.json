    "message_2": "To prove that (A × B)' ≠ A' × B', we will show that there exists at least one element that belongs to one of the sets but not the other.\n\nFirst, let's define the Cartesian product of two sets A and B as A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}. In our case, A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's define the complement of a set A as A' = {x | x ∉ A}. Since A = {1, 2}, A' contains all elements except 1 and 2. Similarly, B = {3, 4}, so B' contains all elements except 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the Cartesian product A × B, denoted as (A × B)'. This set contains all elements that are not in A × B. So, (A × B)' contains all ordered pairs (x, y) such that (x, y) ∉ A × B. In other words, (A × B)' contains all ordered pairs (x, y) where x ∉ A or y ∉ B.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of the complements A' × B', which contains all ordered pairs (a', b') where a' ∈ A' and b' ∈ B'. Since A' contains all elements except 1 and 2, and B' contains all elements except 3 and 4, A' × B' contains ordered pairs where the first element is not 1 or 2, and the second element is not 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the ordered pair (1, 5). This ordered pair is in (A × B)' because 1 ∈ A and 5 ∉ B. However, (1, 5) is not in A' × B' because the first element, 1, is in A, not A'. Therefore, (A × B)' ≠ A' × B', as there exists at least one element that belongs to one of the sets but not the other."
