    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake curve is formed by applying the Koch curve construction to each side of an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, every straight line segment is replaced with a Koch curve segment, which has 4 segments of 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nAfter the first iteration, each side of the equilateral triangle will have 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original side. So, the total length of the curve after the first iteration is:\n\n3 sides * 4 segments/side * (1/3) = 4 units\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the 4 segments from the first iteration will be replaced by 4 segments of 1/3 the length. So, the total length of the curve after the second iteration is:\n\n4 segments * 4 segments/segment * (1/3) = 16/3 units\n\nAfter the third iteration, each of the 16 segments from the second iteration will be replaced by 4 segments of 1/3 the length. So, the total length of the curve after the third iteration is:\n\n(16/3) segments * 4 segments/segment * (1/3) = 64/9 units\n\nSo, the length of the Koch snowflake curve after three iterations with an initial segment length of 1 unit is 64/9 units."
