    "message_1": "Suppose a car is driving on a road with speed between 0 mph and 100 mph. The fuzzy logic system categorizes the speed into three sets: low, medium, and high based on the following rules:\n\n- If the speed is less than or equal to 30 mph, it belongs to the \"low\" speed set.\n- If the speed is greater than 30 mph and less than or equal to 70 mph, it belongs to the \"medium\" speed set.\n- If the speed is greater than 70 mph, it belongs to the \"high\" speed set.\n\nIf the car's speed is 50 mph, what is the degree of membership of the speed in the \"medium\" set?",
    "message_2": "Since the car's speed is 50 mph, it falls within the \"medium\" speed set, which is defined as speeds greater than 30 mph and less than or equal to 70 mph. In this case, the degree of membership of the speed in the \"medium\" set is 1, as it fully belongs to this set."
