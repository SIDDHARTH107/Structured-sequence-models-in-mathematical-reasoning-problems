    "message_1": "A wheel has a diameter of 2 meters and is rotating at a speed of 4 revolutions per minute. If a point on the edge of the wheel moves in a sinusoidal motion as it rotates, what is the average value of the sine function over one complete revolution? (Hint: use the formula for the average value of a function over an interval)",
    "message_2": "To find the average value of the sine function over one complete revolution, we can use the formula for the average value of a function over an interval:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[f(x) dx] from a to b\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) is the sine function, and we want to find the average value over one complete revolution, which corresponds to an interval of 0 to 2π (since the sine function has a period of 2π).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nAverage value = (1/(2π-0)) * ∫[sin(x) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of the sine function:\n\n∫[sin(x) dx] = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits of the interval:\n\n[-cos(2π) + C] - [-cos(0) + C] = -cos(2π) + cos(0) = -1 + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can plug this result back into the formula for the average value:\n\nAverage value = (1/(2π-0)) * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the average value of the sine function over one complete revolution is 0."
