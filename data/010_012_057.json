Define a function f: M → R by the rule f(p) = max{u · p : u is a unit vector in R³}. Here p denotes a point in M and u · p denotes the dot product of the vectors u and p. Show that there is no smooth function on M that coincides with f when restricted to the set of points p in M with |f(p)| ≤ 1/2.",
    "message_2": "To show that there is no smooth function on M that coincides with f when restricted to the set of points p in M with |f(p)| ≤ 1/2, we will use a proof by contradiction. Suppose there exists a smooth function g: M → R such that g(p) = f(p) for all p in M with |f(p)| ≤ 1/2.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function f. For any point p in M, we have:\n\nf(p) = max{u · p : u is a unit vector in R³}\n\nSince u and p are both unit vectors, the maximum value of their dot product is 1, which occurs when u and p are parallel (i.e., u = p). Therefore, f(p) = 1 for all p in M.\n\nNow, consider the set S = {p in M : |f(p)| ≤ 1/2}. Since f(p) = 1 for all p in M, the set S is empty. Thus, the restriction of g to S is vacuously true, as there are no points in S to consider.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our assumption that there exists a smooth function g that coincides with f on S. Since our assumption led to a contradiction, we conclude that there is no smooth function on M that coincides with f when restricted to the set of points p in M with |f(p)| ≤ 1/2."
