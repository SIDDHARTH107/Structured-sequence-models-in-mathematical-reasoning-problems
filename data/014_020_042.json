    "message_2": "The given information states that the key length is 5. However, if we were to use the Kasiski examination to find the most probable length of the key, we would need to have a ciphertext to analyze. The frequency distribution of letters alone is not sufficient to perform the Kasiski examination.\n\nThe Kasiski examination involves finding repeated sequences of letters in the ciphertext and measuring the distance between them. The greatest common divisor of these distances often reveals the length of the key used in the Vigenere cipher. Without the actual ciphertext, we cannot perform this analysis."
