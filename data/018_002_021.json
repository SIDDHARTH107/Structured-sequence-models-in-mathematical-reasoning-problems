Therefore, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of A. Since A ∩ B = {2, 3}, we can see that both 2 and 3 are elements of A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of B.
