    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of equations:\n\n(1) x + y + 2z = 4\n(2) 3x - 2y + iz = 1 - i\n(3) 2x + (1 + i)y - 3iz = -2 + 4i\n\nWe will eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (3) by -1:\n\n(1') 3x + 3y + 6z = 12\n(3') -2x - (1 + i)y + 3iz = 2 - 4i\n\nNow, let's add equations (1') and (3'):\n\n(4) 2y + (6 + 3i)z = 14 - 4i\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from equations (1) and (2). To do this, we will multiply equation (1) by -3 and add it to equation (2):\n\n(5) -5y - 5iz = -11 + i\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables, y and z:\n\n(4) 2y + (6 + 3i)z = 14 - 4i\n(5) -5y - 5iz = -11 + i\n\nLet's multiply equation (4) by 5 and equation (5) by 2 to eliminate y:\n\n(4') 10y + (30 + 15i)z = 70 - 20i\n(5') -10y - 10iz = -22 + 2i\n\nNow, let's add equations (4') and (5'):\n\n(6) (30 + 5i)z = 48 - 18i\n\nNow, let's solve for z:\n\nz = (48 - 18i) / (30 + 5i)\n\nTo get rid of the complex denominator, we will multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is (30 - 5i):\n\nz = [(48 - 18i)(30 - 5i)] / [(30 + 5i)(30 - 5i)]\n\nz = [1440 - 240i - 540i + 90i^2] / [900 - 25i^2]\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we have:\n\nz = [1440 - 780i - 90] / [900 + 25]\n\nz = [1350 - 780i] / 925\n\nz = (6/5) - (12/5)i\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into equations (4) and (5) to find y:\n\n(4) 2y + (6 + 3i)((6/5) - (12/5)i) = 14 - 4i\n\n2y + (36/5 - 72/5i + 36/5i - 36/5i^2) = 14 - 4i\n\n2y + (36/5 + 36) = 14 - 4i + 72/5i - 36/5i\n\n2y = -22/5 + 4i\n\ny = (-11/5) + 2i\n\nFinally, we can substitute y and z back into equation (1) to find x:\n\nx + (-11/5 + 2i) + 2((6/5) - (12/5)i) = 4\n\nx - 11/5 + 2i + 12/5 - 24/5i = 4\n\nx = 1/5 + 22/5i\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 1/5 + 22/5i\ny = -11/5 + 2i\nz = 6/5 - 12/5i"
