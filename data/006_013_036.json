    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a hurricane hitting the specific coastal region during the hurricane season, we can use the historical data provided.\n\nOut of the past 50 years, the region has been hit by a hurricane 15 times. So, the probability of a hurricane hitting the region in any given year can be calculated as:\n\n(Number of times the region was hit by a hurricane) / (Total number of years)\n\nProbability = 15 / 50\n\nProbability = 0.3\n\nTherefore, the probability of a hurricane hitting the specific coastal region during the hurricane season is 0.3 or 30%."
