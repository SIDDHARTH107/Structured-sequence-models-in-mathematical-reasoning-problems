    "message_1": "Suppose that Alice wants to send a message to Bob using Elliptic Curve Cryptography with the curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the field of integers modulo 17. Alice's private key is 3, and her public key is the point P = (5,1). If Alice wants to encrypt the message \"HELLO\", which can be represented as the number 072508121515, what is the encrypted message that Alice should send to Bob?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Alice needs to choose a random integer k and compute the ciphertext as a pair of points (C1, C2), where:\n\nC1 = k * G (G is the generator point of the elliptic curve)\nC2 = M + k * P (M is the message point, and P is Alice's public key)\n\nFirst, let's find the generator point G. We can use the given curve equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 (mod 17) to find a point on the curve. Let's try x = 2:\n\ny^2 = 2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 14 (mod 17)\n\ny^2 = 14 has two solutions in the field of integers modulo 17: y = 6 and y = 11. We can choose either of these points as the generator point G. Let's choose G = (2, 6).\n\nNow, let's choose a random integer k. For simplicity, let's choose k = 2.\n\nCompute C1 = k * G = 2 * (2, 6). To perform point doubling, we need to compute the slope λ:\n\nλ = (3 * 2^2 + 2) / (2 * 6) = (12 + 2) / 12 = 14 / 12 = 7 (mod 17)\n\nNow, compute the new x and y coordinates for C1:\n\nx = λ^2 - 2 * 2 = 7^2 - 4 = 45 = 11 (mod 17)\ny = λ * (2 - 11) - 6 = 7 * (-9) - 6 = -69 = 3 (mod 17)\n\nSo, C1 = (11, 3).\n\nNext, compute C2 = M + k * P. First, we need to represent the message \"HELLO\" (072508121515) as a point on the elliptic curve. One way to do this is to use the message as the x-coordinate and find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\nx = 072508121515 (mod 17) = 7 (mod 17)\n\ny^2 = 7^3 + 2*7 + 2 = 345 + 14 + 2 = 361 (mod 17) = 1 (mod 17)\n\ny = 1 (since 1^2 = 1 (mod 17))\n\nSo, M = (7, 1).\n\nNow, compute k * P = 2 * (5, 1):\n\nλ = (3 * 5^2 + 2) / (2 * 1) = (75 + 2) / 2 = 77 / 2 = 1 (mod 17)\n\nx = λ^2 - 2 * 5 = 1^2 - 10 = -9 = 8 (mod 17)\ny = λ * (5 - 8) - 1 = 1 * (-3) - 1 = -4 = 13 (mod 17)\n\nSo, k * P = (8, 13).\n\nFinally, compute C2 = M + k * P = (7, 1) + (8, 13):\n\nλ = (13 - 1) / (8 - 7) = 12 / 1 = 12 (mod 17)\n\nx = λ^2 - 7 - 8 = 12^2 - 15 = 129 = 10 (mod 17)\ny = λ * (7 - 10) - 1 = 12 * (-3) - 1 = -37 = 14 (mod 17)\n\nSo, C2 = (10, 14).\n\nThe encrypted message that Alice should send to Bob is the pair of points (C1, C2) = ((11, 3), (10, 14))."
