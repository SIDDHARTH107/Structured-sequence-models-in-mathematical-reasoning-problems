    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs with a mean life of 800 hours and standard deviation of 50 hours. A random sample of 25 bulbs is selected. Find the 95% confidence interval for the mean life of the bulbs.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the mean life of the bulbs, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a sample mean:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n- The population mean (μ) = 800 hours\n- The population standard deviation (σ) = 50 hours\n- The sample size (n) = 25 bulbs\n\nSince we are looking for the 95% confidence interval, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to 95% confidence level. For a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is 1.96 (you can find this value in a standard z-table or using a calculator).\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 800 ± (1.96 * (50 / √25))\n\nCI = 800 ± (1.96 * (50 / 5))\n\nCI = 800 ± (1.96 * 10)\n\nCI = 800 ± 19.6\n\nSo the 95% confidence interval for the mean life of the bulbs is (780.4, 819.6) hours. This means that we are 95% confident that the true mean life of the bulbs lies between 780.4 hours and 819.6 hours."
