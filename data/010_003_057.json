    "message_2": "The T1-axiom (also known as the T1 separation axiom) states that for any two distinct points x and y in a topological space X, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∉ U, and y ∈ V, x ∉ V.\n\nLet's check if the topological space X = {a, b, c, d} with the topology T = {{}, {a}, {a, b}, X} satisfies this axiom.\n\n1. Take two distinct points x = a and y = b. We have the open sets {a} and {a, b} in T. We can see that a ∈ {a}, b ∉ {a}, and b ∈ {a, b}, a ∉ {a, b}. So, the T1-axiom holds for these points.\n\n2. Now, let's consider x = a and y = c. We can't find open sets U and V in T such that a ∈ U, c ∉ U, and c ∈ V, a ∉ V. The only open set containing a is {a}, but it doesn't contain c. The only open set containing c is X, but it also contains a. Thus, the T1-axiom doesn't hold for these points.\n\nSince we found a pair of points for which the T1-axiom doesn't hold, the topological space X = {a, b, c, d} with the topology T = {{}, {a}, {a, b}, X} does not satisfy the T1-axiom."
