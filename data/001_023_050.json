    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos(3x) - 1 = 0, we first isolate the cosine function:\n\n2cos(3x) = 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\ncos(3x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that satisfy this equation, given that x is between 0 and 2π.\n\nTo find the angle whose cosine is 1/2, we can use the inverse cosine function:\n\n3x = cos^(-1)(1/2)\n\nThe angles whose cosine is 1/2 are π/3 and 5π/3 in the range of 0 to 2π. However, since we have a 3x inside the cosine function, we need to consider the range of 0 to 6π for 3x:\n\n3x = π/3, 5π/3, 7π/3, 11π/3, 13π/3, 17π/3\n\nNow, we divide each of these angles by 3 to find the values of x:\n\nx = π/9, 5π/9, 7π/9, 11π/9, 13π/9, 17π/9\n\nThese are the six values of x that satisfy the equation 2cos(3x) - 1 = 0 in the range of 0 to 2π."
