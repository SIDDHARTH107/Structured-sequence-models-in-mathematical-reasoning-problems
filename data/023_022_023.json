    "message_1": "Suppose the price of a stock is modeled by the function $f(t) = t^2 e^{-0.5t}$ for $t \\ge 0$. Using Fourier transform, find the present value of the stock at time $t=0$. Take the risk-free interest rate to be $3\\%$, continuous compounding.",
    "message_2": "To find the present value of the stock at time $t=0$, we need to discount the future cash flows generated by the stock. In this case, the cash flow is given by the function $f(t) = t^2 e^{-0.5t}$. The discount factor for continuous compounding at a risk-free interest rate of $3\\%$ is given by $e^{-rt}$, where $r=0.03$. \n\nThe present value of the stock at time $t=0$ is given by the integral:\n\n$$PV = \\int_0^\\infty f(t) e^{-rt} dt = \\int_0^\\infty t^2 e^{-0.5t} e^{-0.03t} dt$$\n\nCombining the exponential terms, we get:\n\n$$PV = \\int_0^\\infty t^2 e^{-(0.5+0.03)t} dt = \\int_0^\\infty t^2 e^{-0.53t} dt$$\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let $u = t^2$ and $dv = e^{-0.53t} dt$. Then, $du = 2t dt$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{0.53} e^{-0.53t}$.\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n$$PV = -t^2 \\frac{1}{0.53} e^{-0.53t} \\Big|_0^\\infty + \\frac{1}{0.53} \\int_0^\\infty 2t e^{-0.53t} dt$$\n\nThe first term goes to zero as $t$ goes to infinity. Now, we need to solve the second integral. We can use integration by parts again. Let $u = 2t$ and $dv = e^{-0.53t} dt$. Then, $du = 2 dt$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{0.53} e^{-0.53t}$.\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n$$PV = \\frac{1}{0.53} \\left( -2t \\frac{1}{0.53} e^{-0.53t} \\Big|_0^\\infty + \\frac{1}{0.53} \\int_0^\\infty 2 e^{-0.53t} dt \\right)$$\n\nThe first term goes to zero as $t$ goes to infinity. Now, we need to solve the third integral:\n\n$$PV = \\frac{1}{0.53^2} \\int_0^\\infty 2 e^{-0.53t} dt$$\n\nThis is a simple exponential integral:\n\n$$PV = \\frac{1}{0.53^2} \\left( -\\frac{2}{0.53} e^{-0.53t} \\Big|_0^\\infty \\right)$$\n\nEvaluating the integral:\n\n$$PV = \\frac{1}{0.53^2} \\left( -\\frac{2}{0.53} (0 - 1) \\right) = \\frac{2}{0.53^3}$$\n\nSo, the present value of the stock at time $t=0$ is:\n\n$$PV \\approx \\frac{2}{0.53^3} \\approx 7.112$$"
