    "message_2": "Let's consider the possible remainders when an integer a is divided by 5, given that a is not divisible by 5. The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We will now find the remainder when a^4 is divided by 5 for each of these cases.\n\nCase 1: a ≡ 1 (mod 5)\na^4 ≡ 1^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nCase 2: a ≡ 2 (mod 5)\na^4 ≡ 2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nCase 3: a ≡ 3 (mod 5)\na^4 ≡ 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nCase 4: a ≡ 4 (mod 5)\na^4 ≡ 4^4 ≡ 256 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nIn all cases, the remainder when a^4 is divided by 5 is 1."
