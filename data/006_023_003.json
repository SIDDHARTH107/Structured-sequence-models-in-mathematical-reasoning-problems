    "message_1": "A market research firm has conducted a study on the shopping habits of customers at a popular retail store. The study found that 35% of customers who enter the store will make a purchase. If the store receives 200 customers in a day, what is the probability that fewer than 60 customers will make a purchase?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (customers making a purchase) out of n trials (total customers)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (35% or 0.35 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (200 customers)\n- k is the number of successes (we want to find the probability of fewer than 60 customers making a purchase)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of fewer than 60 customers making a purchase, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 59:\n\nP(X < 60) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 59\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities for each k and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 60) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 59)\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula for each k and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X < 60) ≈ 0.028\n\nSo, the probability that fewer than 60 customers will make a purchase is approximately 2.8%."
