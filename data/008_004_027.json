    "message_2": "To solve this system of homogeneous linear equations, we can first simplify the system by dividing the second and third equations by their common factors.\n\n$$\\begin{cases}x+y+z=0\\\\x+2y+z=0\\\\x+y+z=0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nNow, we can see that the first and third equations are the same. We can eliminate the third equation and work with the remaining two equations:\n\n$$\\begin{cases}x+y+z=0\\\\x+2y+z=0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nNext, we can eliminate one of the variables by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n$$(x+2y+z) - (x+y+z) = 0$$\n$$y-z=0$$\n$$y=z$$\n\nNow, we can express the solution as a linear combination of the variables. Since $y=z$, we can substitute $z$ for $y$ in the first equation:\n\n$$x+z+z=0$$\n$$x+2z=0$$\n$$x=-2z$$\n\nThe solution can be expressed as a linear combination of the variable $z$:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{bmatrix} = z\\begin{bmatrix}-2\\\\1\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nWhere $z$ is any scalar."
