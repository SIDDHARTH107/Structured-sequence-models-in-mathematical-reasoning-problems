    "message_2": "To determine the frequency content of the signal f(t) = 5sin(200πt) + 3cos(400πt) and its corresponding amplitude spectrum, we can use the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform of a continuous-time signal is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier Transform of the signal f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given signal in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nf(t) = 5sin(200πt) + 3cos(400πt)\n     = 5/2j [e^(j200πt) - e^(-j200πt)] + 3/2 [e^(j400πt) + e^(-j400πt)]\n\nNow, let's compute the Fourier Transform of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n     = ∫[(5/2j)(e^(j200πt) - e^(-j200πt)) + (3/2)(e^(j400πt) + e^(-j400πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into four separate integrals:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2j)∫[e^(j200πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt - (5/2j)∫[e^(-j200πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt + (3/2)∫[e^(j400πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt + (3/2)∫[e^(-j400πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials in each integral:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2j)∫[e^(j(200π - ω)t)] dt - (5/2j)∫[e^(j(-200π - ω)t)] dt + (3/2)∫[e^(j(400π - ω)t)] dt + (3/2)∫[e^(j(-400π - ω)t)] dt\n\nNow, we can solve each integral using the following property of the Fourier Transform:\n\n∫[e^(j(α - ω)t)] dt = 2π * δ(ω - α)\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nApplying this property to each integral, we get:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2j)[2π * δ(ω - 200π)] - (5/2j)[2π * δ(ω + 200π)] + (3/2)[2π * δ(ω - 400π)] + (3/2)[2π * δ(ω + 400π)]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nF(ω) = 5πj[δ(ω - 200π) - δ(ω + 200π)] + 3π[δ(ω - 400π) + δ(ω + 400π)]\n\nThe amplitude spectrum is given by the magnitude of the Fourier Transform:\n\n|F(ω)| = 5π|δ(ω - 200π) - δ(ω + 200π)| + 3π|δ(ω - 400π) + δ(ω + 400π)|\n\nThe frequency content of the signal is given by the frequencies where the amplitude spectrum is non-zero. In this case, the frequency content is:\n\nω = ±200π and ω = ±400π\n\nConverting angular frequencies to regular frequencies (f = ω/2π):\n\nf = ±100 Hz and f = ±200 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal f(t) = 5sin(200πt) + 3cos(400πt) consists of two frequencies: 100 Hz and 200 Hz. The corresponding amplitude spectrum is given by the magnitudes 5π and 3π, respectively."
