    "message_2": "To find the Laplacian of f(x, y, z) = xyz on the sphere with radius 2, we first need to find the partial derivatives of f with respect to x, y, and z. Then, we will find the second partial derivatives and sum them up to get the Laplacian.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of f:\n\n∂f/∂x = yz\n∂f/∂y = xz\n∂f/∂z = xy\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 0\n∂²f/∂y² = 0\n∂²f/∂z² = 0\n\nThe Laplacian of f is the sum of these second partial derivatives:\n\nΔf = ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² + ∂²f/∂z² = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nSo, the Laplacian of f(x, y, z) = xyz on the sphere with radius 2 is 0."
