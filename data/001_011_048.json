    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2x+1)/(x-3) = 3/2, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(2x + 1) * 2 = (x - 3) * 3\n\nNow, distribute the numbers on both sides:\n\n4x + 2 = 3x - 9\n\nNext, subtract 3x from both sides:\n\n4x - 3x + 2 = 3x - 3x - 9\n\nx + 2 = -9\n\nFinally, subtract 2 from both sides:\n\nx + 2 - 2 = -9 - 2\n\nx = -11\n\nSo, the solution is x = -11."
