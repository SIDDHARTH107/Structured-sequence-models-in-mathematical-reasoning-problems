    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative L[F,V] of the vector field V with respect to the smooth function F, we need to apply the vector field V to the function F. This means that we need to compute the action of V on F, which is given by the directional derivative of F along the vector field V.\n\nRecall that the action of a vector field V on a function F is given by:\n\nV(F) = (2x∂/∂x + y∂/∂y + z∂/∂z)(F)\n\nNow, we need to compute the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂F/∂x = F_x\n∂F/∂y = F_y\n∂F/∂z = F_z\n\nNow, we can compute the action of V on F:\n\nV(F) = 2x(F_x) + y(F_y) + z(F_z)\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate this expression at the point p = (1,1,1):\n\nL[F,V](1,1,1) = 2(1)(F_x(1,1,1)) + (1)(F_y(1,1,1)) + (1)(F_z(1,1,1))\n\nL[F,V](1,1,1) = 2F_x(1,1,1) + F_y(1,1,1) + F_z(1,1,1)\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of V with respect to F at the point p = (1,1,1) is given by:\n\nL[F,V](1,1,1) = 2F_x(1,1,1) + F_y(1,1,1) + F_z(1,1,1)"
