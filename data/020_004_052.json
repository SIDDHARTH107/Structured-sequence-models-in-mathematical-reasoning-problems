    "message_1": "A factory produces three products: A, B, and C. To produce each product, the factory requires the use of two types of machines: X and Y. Each machine has a maximum usage limit per day: Machine X can be used for 8 hours, and Machine Y can be used for 12 hours. The production costs per unit of product A, B, and C are $3, $4, and $5, respectively. The factory wants to maximize its daily profit while staying within the usage limits of the machines.\n\n- How many units of each product should be produced to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the time required for each product on machines X and Y, as well as the selling price of each product. Let's assume the following:\n\n- Time required on machine X: A = 1 hour, B = 2 hours, C = 3 hours\n- Time required on machine Y: A = 2 hours, B = 1 hour, C = 2 hours\n- Selling price per unit: A = $6, B = $8, C = $10\n\nLet x, y, and z be the number of units produced for products A, B, and C, respectively. The profit function P(x, y, z) can be written as:\n\nP(x, y, z) = 6x - 3x + 8y - 4y + 10z - 5z = 3x + 4y + 5z\n\nWe need to maximize this profit function subject to the constraints of the machines' usage limits:\n\n1x + 2y + 3z ≤ 8 (Machine X constraint)\n2x + 1y + 2z ≤ 12 (Machine Y constraint)\nx, y, z ≥ 0 (Non-negative production quantities)\n\nThis is a linear programming problem. To solve it, we can use the graphical method or the simplex method. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph with x, y, and z as the axes. The feasible region is the intersection of all constraints. Then, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex. The vertex with the highest profit value will give us the optimal production quantities for products A, B, and C.\n\nAfter plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region, we get the following vertices:\n\n1. (0, 0, 0)\n2. (0, 4, 0)\n3. (4, 0, 0)\n4. (0, 0, 2)\n5. (4, 2, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0, 0) = 3(0) + 4(0) + 5(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 4, 0) = 3(0) + 4(4) + 5(0) = 16\n3. P(4, 0, 0) = 3(4) + 4(0) + 5(0) = 12\n4. P(0, 0, 2) = 3(0) + 4(0) + 5(2) = 10\n5. P(4, 2, 0) = 3(4) + 4(2) + 5(0) = 20\n\nThe highest profit value is 20, which occurs at vertex (4, 2, 0). Therefore, the factory should produce 4 units of product A, 2 units of product B, and 0 units of product C to maximize its daily profit."
