    "message_2": "Let's first find the image of the upper half plane under the reflection across the real axis. The reflection of a complex number $z = x + yi$ across the real axis is given by its conjugate $\\bar{z} = x - yi$. So, the image of $\\mathbb{H}$ under this reflection is the lower half plane $\\mathbb{L} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\text{Im}(z) < 0\\}$.\n\nNow, let's find the image of the lower half plane under the reflection across the circle $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - i| = 1\\}$. The reflection of a point $z$ across a circle with center $a$ and radius $r$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$z' = a + \\frac{r^2}{\\bar{z} - \\bar{a}}$$\n\nIn our case, $a = i$ and $r = 1$. So, the reflection of a point $z \\in \\mathbb{L}$ across the circle is given by:\n\n$$z' = i + \\frac{1}{\\bar{z} - (-i)} = i + \\frac{1}{\\bar{z} + i}$$\n\nNow, let's find the image of the lower half plane $\\mathbb{L}$ under this reflection. Let $z = x - yi \\in \\mathbb{L}$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $y > 0$. Then, the image of $z$ under the reflection is:\n\n$$z' = i + \\frac{1}{x + yi + i} = i + \\frac{1}{x + (y + 1)i}$$\n\nTo find the image of $\\mathbb{L}$, we need to find the set of all such $z'$ as $z$ varies over $\\mathbb{L}$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator, we get:\n\n$$z' = i + \\frac{1}{x + (y + 1)i} = i + \\frac{x - (y + 1)i}{x^2 + (y + 1)^2}$$\n\nNow, let $z' = u + vi$, where $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then, we have:\n\n$$u + vi = i + \\frac{x - (y + 1)i}{x^2 + (y + 1)^2}$$\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\n$$u = \\frac{x}{x^2 + (y + 1)^2}$$\n$$v = \\frac{1 - y}{x^2 + (y + 1)^2}$$\n\nAs $z$ varies over $\\mathbb{L}$, $x$ can take any real value, and $y$ can take any positive value. It can be seen that $u$ can also take any real value, and $v$ can take any value in the interval $(-\\infty, 1)$. Therefore, the image of the lower half plane under the reflection across the circle is the lower half plane excluding the circle itself:\n\n$$\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\text{Im}(z) < 1, |z - i| > 1\\}$$\n\nSo, the image of the upper half plane $\\mathbb{H}$ under the reflection across the real axis followed by the reflection across the circle is the lower half plane excluding the circle:\n\n$$\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\text{Im}(z) < 1, |z - i| > 1\\}$$"
