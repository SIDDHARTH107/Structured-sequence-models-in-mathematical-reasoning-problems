    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups in G are 1 and 2, respectively. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since the number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 2, P is a normal subgroup of G. \n\nNow, consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIn this case, G is a product of its Sylow subgroups, so G ≅ P × Q. Since P is of order 5 and Q is of order 2, G ≅ C5 × C2 ≅ C10, where Cn denotes the cyclic group of order n.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIn this case, we know that |P| = 5 and |Q| = 2. Since P is normal in G, we can form the semi-direct product of P and Q. Let a be a generator of P and b be a generator of Q. Then, we have the following relations:\n\na^5 = e, b^2 = e, and bab^(-1) = a^k, where e is the identity element and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 4.\n\nSince G is non-abelian, k cannot be 1. If k = 2, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, which has order 10. If k = 3, 4, then G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 10, which is unique up to isomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 10 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or the unique non-abelian group of order 10."
