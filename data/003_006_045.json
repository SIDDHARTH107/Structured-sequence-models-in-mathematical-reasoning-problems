    "message_2": "First, let's find the measure of angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°, we can calculate angle C as follows:\n\nC = 180° - A - B\nC = 180° - 35° - 50°\nC = 95°\n\nNow, we can use the law of sines to find the length of side b. The law of sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides. In this case, we have:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B)\n\nWe are given a = 10 cm, A = 35°, and B = 50°. We want to find the length of side b. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n10 / sin(35°) = b / sin(50°)\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb = (10 * sin(50°)) / sin(35°)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values, we get:\n\nb ≈ (10 * 0.7660) / 0.5736\nb ≈ 7.660 / 0.5736\nb ≈ 13.35 cm\n\nSo, the length of side b is approximately 13.35 cm, and the measure of angle C is 95°."
