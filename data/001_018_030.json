    "message_2": "Using the logarithmic properties, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\nlog(4) + log(5) - log(2) = log(4 * 5) - log(2) = log(20) - log(2)\n\nNow, using the quotient rule for logarithms, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b), we get:\n\nlog(20) - log(2) = log(20/2) = log(10)\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is log(10)."
