    "message_2": "To determine whether a graph is connected or not, we can use the following property:\n\nA graph with n vertices is connected if and only if it has at least (n-1) edges and there is no cycle in the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges. Since 10 > (7-1) = 6, the graph has enough edges to potentially be connected. However, we need to check if there is a cycle in the graph.\n\nLet's consider the minimum number of edges required to form a cycle in a graph. A cycle is formed when there is a closed path, which means that the minimum cycle would be a triangle (3 vertices connected in a loop). This requires at least 3 edges.\n\nNow, let's consider a tree, which is a connected graph with no cycles. A tree with n vertices always has exactly (n-1) edges. In this case, a tree with 7 vertices would have 6 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 10 edges, which is more than the 6 edges required for a tree with 7 vertices, it must contain at least one cycle. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the graph is connected.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot determine whether the given graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges is connected or not without more information about the specific connections between the vertices."
