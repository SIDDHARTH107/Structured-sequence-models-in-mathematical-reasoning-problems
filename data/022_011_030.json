    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^3 - 1 = 0\nz^3 = 1\n\nThis equation has three solutions, which are the cube roots of unity:\n\nz_1 = 1 (1^3 = 1)\nz_2 = e^(2πi/3) (a complex number with magnitude 1 and angle 120 degrees)\nz_3 = e^(4πi/3) (a complex number with magnitude 1 and angle 240 degrees)\n\nNow, let's find the poles of f(z) by finding the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz - 1 = 0\nz = 1\n\nHowever, we can see that f(z) has a removable singularity at z = 1, since both the numerator and the denominator have a factor of (z - 1). We can factor the numerator using the difference of cubes formula:\n\nz^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)\n\nSo, f(z) can be simplified to:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + z + 1)\n\nNow, f(z) has no poles, as the denominator is a constant (non-zero) value.\n\nTo determine the order of each zero, we can look at the multiplicity of the roots in the simplified function. Since each zero appears only once in the quadratic equation, the order of each zero is 1.\n\nIn summary, f(z) has three zeros of order 1 at z = 1, z = e^(2πi/3), and z = e^(4πi/3), and no poles."
