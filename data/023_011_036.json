    "message_2": "Since g(t) is time-limited to the interval [-2, 2], it means that g(t) = 0 for t < -2 and t > 2. According to the properties of the Fourier transform, if a function is time-limited, its Fourier transform is band-limited. This means that G(f) will be a continuous function with no discontinuities.\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the exact form of G(f) without more information about g(t). Therefore, we cannot directly compute the value of G(10) based on the given information.\n\nBut, we can use the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem to make some observations. According to the theorem, if a function is band-limited to a maximum frequency of B, it can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples taken at a rate of at least 2B.\n\nIn this case, since g(t) is time-limited to the interval [-2, 2], the maximum frequency B can be determined as follows:\n\nB = 1 / (2 * (2 - (-2))) = 1 / 4\n\nSo, the minimum sampling rate required to perfectly reconstruct g(t) is:\n\nSampling rate = 2B = 1/2\n\nNow, let's look at the given information about G(f). We have G(2) = 5 and G(5) = 10. Since the minimum sampling rate required to perfectly reconstruct g(t) is 1/2, the maximum frequency component in G(f) should be less than or equal to 1/2. However, we are given non-zero values for G(2) and G(5), which are greater than 1/2. This implies that the given information is inconsistent with the time-limited nature of g(t).\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine the value of G(10) based on the given information, as it contradicts the time-limited nature of g(t)."
