    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. In this case, we want to minimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 25.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of PSO to find the minimum value of the function:\n\n1. Initialize a swarm of particles with random positions and velocities within the search space (e.g., x in the range of -10 to 20).\n2. Calculate the fitness of each particle (i.e., the value of f(x) for each particle's position).\n3. Update each particle's personal best position if its current position has a better fitness.\n4. Update the global best position if a particle's personal best position has a better fitness.\n5. Update each particle's velocity and position based on its personal best position, the global best position, and some inertia and acceleration coefficients.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the change in the global best position is smaller than a threshold).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, the global best position will be an approximation of the minimum value of the function f(x). However, it's important to note that PSO is a heuristic optimization method, and it may not always find the exact minimum value.\n\nIn this specific case, we can find the minimum value of the function analytically by completing the square:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 10x + 25 = (x - 5)^2\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) occurs when x = 5, and f(5) = (5 - 5)^2 = 0."
