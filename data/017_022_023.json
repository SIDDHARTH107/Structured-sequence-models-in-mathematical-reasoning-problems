    "message_2": "There are 5 non-abelian groups of order 60 up to isomorphism. These groups are:\n\n1. The alternating group A5\n2. The direct product A5 × C1\n3. The direct product A4 × C5\n4. The direct product S3 × C10\n5. The direct product D5 × C6\n\nWe will now show that each of these groups is non-abelian and isomorphic to one of the three groups mentioned.\n\n1. The alternating group A5:\nA5 is a well-known non-abelian simple group of order 60. It is not isomorphic to C60 since it is non-abelian. It is not isomorphic to A5 × C2 since the order of A5 × C2 is 120. Thus, A5 is one of the non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n2. The direct product A5 × C1:\nThis group is isomorphic to A5 since C1 is the trivial group. Thus, it is also one of the non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n3. The direct product A4 × C5:\nA4 is a non-abelian group of order 12, and C5 is a cyclic group of order 5. Their direct product has order 12 × 5 = 60. Since A4 is non-abelian, the direct product is also non-abelian. It is not isomorphic to C60 since it is non-abelian. It is not isomorphic to A5 × C2 since the order of A5 × C2 is 120. Thus, A4 × C5 is one of the non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n4. The direct product S3 × C10:\nS3 is a non-abelian group of order 6, and C10 is a cyclic group of order 10. Their direct product has order 6 × 10 = 60. Since S3 is non-abelian, the direct product is also non-abelian. It is not isomorphic to C60 since it is non-abelian. It is not isomorphic to A5 × C2 since the order of A5 × C2 is 120. Thus, S3 × C10 is one of the non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n5. The direct product D5 × C6:\nD5 is the dihedral group of order 10, and C6 is a cyclic group of order 6. Their direct product has order 10 × 6 = 60. Since D5 is non-abelian, the direct product is also non-abelian. It is not isomorphic to C60 since it is non-abelian. It is not isomorphic to A5 × C2 since the order of A5 × C2 is 120. Thus, D5 × C6 is one of the non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 5 non-abelian groups of order 60 up to isomorphism. None of them are isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2, so they are all distinct non-abelian groups of order 60."
