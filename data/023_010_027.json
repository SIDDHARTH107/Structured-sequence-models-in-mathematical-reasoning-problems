    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the highest frequency component in the resulting spectrum, we first need to understand the two-dimensional Fourier transform. The 2D Fourier transform is an extension of the 1D Fourier transform, which is used to analyze the frequency content of a signal. In the case of an image, the 2D Fourier transform is used to analyze the frequency content of the pixel intensities.\n\nThe 2D Fourier transform of an image f(x, y) with dimensions M x N (in this case, 128 x 128) is given by:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / M + v * y / N)))) for x = 0 to M-1 and y = 0 to N-1\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the resulting frequency spectrum, j is the imaginary unit, and u and v are the frequency indices.\n\nThe highest frequency component in the resulting spectrum corresponds to the maximum values of u and v, which are M-1 and N-1, respectively. In this case, M = N = 128, so the highest frequency component corresponds to u = 127 and v = 127.\n\nTo find the magnitude of this component, we can compute the absolute value of F(127, 127):\n\n|F(127, 127)| = |Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (127 * x / 128 + 127 * y / 128))))|\n\nHowever, without the actual pixel values of the image, we cannot compute the exact magnitude of the highest frequency component. If you have the pixel values, you can plug them into the formula above to find the magnitude of the highest frequency component in the resulting spectrum."
