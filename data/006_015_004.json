    "message_1": "A company has 100 computers in its network. The probability of a ransomware attack occurring on any given computer is 0.02. What is the probability that at least two computers in the network will be affected by a ransomware attack?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least two computers being affected by a ransomware attack, we can first find the probability of none or only one computer being affected and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of no computer being affected:\nThe probability of a computer not being affected by ransomware is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\nFor all 100 computers to not be affected, the probability is (0.98)^100.\n\nNow let's find the probability of exactly one computer being affected:\nThere are 100 computers, so there are 100 ways to choose one computer to be affected.\nThe probability of one computer being affected is 0.02, and the probability of the other 99 computers not being affected is (0.98)^99.\nSo, the probability of exactly one computer being affected is 100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least two computers being affected:\n1 - (probability of no computer being affected + probability of exactly one computer being affected)\n\n1 - ((0.98)^100 + 100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\n1 - ((0.98)^100 + 100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99) â‰ˆ 0.2648\n\nSo, the probability that at least two computers in the network will be affected by a ransomware attack is approximately 0.2648 or 26.48%."
