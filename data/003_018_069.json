    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 2sin(3x) - cos(4x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, we have two terms: 2sin(3x) and -cos(4x).\n\nFor the first term, 2sin(3x), the outer function is 2sin(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. The derivative of 2sin(u) with respect to u is 2cos(u), and the derivative of 3x with respect to x is 3. So, using the chain rule, the derivative of 2sin(3x) with respect to x is:\n\n(2cos(u))(3) = 6cos(3x)\n\nFor the second term, -cos(4x), the outer function is -cos(v) and the inner function is v = 4x. The derivative of -cos(v) with respect to v is sin(v), and the derivative of 4x with respect to x is 4. So, using the chain rule, the derivative of -cos(4x) with respect to x is:\n\n(sin(v))(4) = 4sin(4x)\n\nNow, we can combine the derivatives of both terms to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(3x) + 4sin(4x)\n\nNow we need to find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6cos(3(π/6)) + 4sin(4(π/6))\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6cos(π/2) + 4sin(2π/3)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and sin(2π/3) = √3/2, so:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6(0) + 4(√3/2)\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 2√3\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 2sin(3x) - cos(4x) at x = π/6 is 2√3."
