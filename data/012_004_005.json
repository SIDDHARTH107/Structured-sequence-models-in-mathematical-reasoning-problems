    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of G using Kruskal's algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph T to store the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the next edge with the smallest weight to T, if it doesn't form a cycle with the edges already in T.\n4. Repeat step 3 until there are (number of vertices - 1) edges in T.\n\nHowever, since the problem statement doesn't provide the weights of the edges, we cannot proceed with Kruskal's algorithm. Please provide the weights of the edges in the graph to find the minimum spanning tree."
