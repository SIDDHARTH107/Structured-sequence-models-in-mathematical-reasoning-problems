    "message_1": "A student is trying to model the chaotic behavior of a forced van der Pol oscillator using the following equation:\n\n$$\\ddot x + \\mu(x^2-1)\\dot x + x = A\\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $\\mu = 0.5$, $A = 1.5$, $\\omega = 1.2$, $x(0) = 0.5$, and $\\dot x(0) = 0.5$. The student wants to find the maximum amplitude of the oscillator's response as time approaches infinity. What is the maximum amplitude of this system?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of the forced van der Pol oscillator as time approaches infinity, we need to analyze the system's response in the frequency domain. We can do this by applying the method of harmonic balance, which involves assuming a steady-state solution of the form:\n\n$$x(t) = X\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$$\n\nwhere $X$ is the amplitude and $\\phi$ is the phase shift. We can then substitute this assumed solution into the original equation and simplify the terms. After that, we can equate the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms to zero, which will give us two equations in terms of $X$ and $\\phi$. Solving these equations will provide us with the maximum amplitude $X$.\n\nHowever, this process involves complex algebra and is beyond the scope of a simple text response. To find the maximum amplitude, it is recommended to use numerical methods or specialized software, such as MATLAB or Python, to solve the system of equations and obtain the desired result."
