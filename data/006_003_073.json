    "message_2": "There is only one King of Hearts in a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a King of Hearts is 1 (the number of King of Hearts) divided by 52 (the total number of cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 1/52\n\nThe probability of drawing a King of Hearts from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is 1/52 or approximately 0.0192 or 1.92%."
