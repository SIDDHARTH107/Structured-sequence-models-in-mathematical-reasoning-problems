    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor set constructed by removing the middle third of a line segment repeatedly, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces (the left and right segments) and a scaling factor of M = 3 (since we remove the middle third).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThis value is the same for any iteration of the Cantor set, including n = 4. The Hausdorff dimension remains constant as the set becomes more and more intricate with each iteration."
