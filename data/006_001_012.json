    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 flips of a fair coin, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 100 flips)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 50 heads)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of getting heads, which is 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of getting tails, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin)\n\nPlugging in the values for our problem:\n\nP(X = 50) = (100C50) * (0.5^50) * (0.5^50)\n\nFirst, we calculate 100C50:\n\n100! / (50! * 50!) = 100891344545564193334812497256\n\nNext, we calculate (0.5^50) * (0.5^50):\n\n(0.5^50) * (0.5^50) = 8.881784197001252e-16\n\nNow, we multiply the two results:\n\n100891344545564193334812497256 * 8.881784197001252e-16 â‰ˆ 0.0795892\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 flips of a fair coin is approximately 0.0795892, or 7.96%."
