    "message_2": "Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a computational method used to solve optimization problems, inspired by the behavior of ants searching for food. However, as a mathematician, I can find the smallest value of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 10 on the interval [-2, 4] using calculus.\n\nTo find the smallest value of the function, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 12x + 2\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n12x^2 - 12x + 2 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n6x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the critical points:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (6 ± √(6² - 4*6*1)) / (2*6)\n\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 12\n\nx = (6 ± √12) / 12\n\nx ≈ 0.2113, 0.7887\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) = 4(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + 2(-2) + 10 = -32 - 24 - 4 + 10 = -50\nf(0.2113) ≈ 4(0.2113)^3 - 6(0.2113)^2 + 2(0.2113) + 10 ≈ 9.5406\nf(0.7887) ≈ 4(0.7887)^3 - 6(0.7887)^2 + 2(0.7887) + 10 ≈ 9.5406\nf(4) = 4(4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 2(4) + 10 = 256 - 96 + 8 + 10 = 178\n\nThe smallest value of the function f(x) on the interval [-2, 4] is approximately 9.5406, which occurs at x ≈ 0.2113 and x ≈ 0.7887."
