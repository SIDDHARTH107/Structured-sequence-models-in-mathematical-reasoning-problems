    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset consisting of the following numbers: 5, 7, 3, 11, 9, 8, 13, 6, 4, 18. If you want to calculate the median of the dataset using the method of robust statistics, what is the value of the median?",
    "message_2": "To find the median using the method of robust statistics, we first need to sort the dataset in ascending order and then find the middle value(s). If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nFirst, let's sort the dataset in ascending order: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 18.\n\nSince there are 10 data points (an even number), we need to find the average of the two middle values. The middle values are 7 and 8.\n\nNow, let's calculate the average of these two values: (7 + 8) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5.\n\nSo, the median of the dataset using the method of robust statistics is 7.5."
