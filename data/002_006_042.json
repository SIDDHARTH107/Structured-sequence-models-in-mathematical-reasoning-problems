    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nFor a circle with a radius of 7 cm, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 7\nC ≈ 43.98226 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
