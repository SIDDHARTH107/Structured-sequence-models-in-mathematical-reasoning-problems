    "message_2": "The function $f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty z^n$ is the geometric series, which converges on the open unit disk $D = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| < 1\\}$. The sum of the geometric series is given by the formula:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z}$, for $|z| < 1$.\n\nNow, we want to find the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the set $\\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\{1\\}$. The function $g(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z}$ is already analytic on $\\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\{1\\}$, so it serves as the analytic continuation of $f(z)$.\n\nTo find the value of $g(2)$, we simply plug in $z = 2$ into the expression for $g(z)$:\n\n$g(2) = \\frac{1}{1-2} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1$.\n\nSo, the value of $g(2)$ is $-1$."
