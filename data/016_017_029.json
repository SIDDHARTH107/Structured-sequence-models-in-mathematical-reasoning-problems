    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal pattern that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 9th iteration. So, n = 9.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^9)\nLength = 1 * 512\nLength = 512 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 9th iteration is 512 units."
