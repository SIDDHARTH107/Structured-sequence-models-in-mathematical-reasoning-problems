    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n      | 4  3 -1 |  6\n      | 2 -1  3 | -1\n      | 1  1  2 |  3\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 4:\n\n      | 1  3/4 -1/4 |  3/2\n      | 2 -1   3   | -1\n      | 1  1   2   |  3\n\n2. Subtract the first row multiplied by 2 from the second row, and subtract the first row from the third row:\n\n      | 1  3/4 -1/4 |  3/2\n      | 0 -5/2  7/2 | -5\n      | 0  1/4  9/4 |  3/2\n\n3. Multiply the second row by -2/5 and add it to the third row:\n\n      | 1  3/4 -1/4 |  3/2\n      | 0 -5/2  7/2 | -5\n      | 0  0   2   |  0\n\n4. Divide the third row by 2:\n\n      | 1  3/4 -1/4 |  3/2\n      | 0 -5/2  7/2 | -5\n      | 0  0   1   |  0\n\nNow, we will perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. From the third row, we have z = 0.\n\n2. From the second row, we have -5/2 * y + 7/2 * z = -5. Since z = 0, we can solve for y:\n\n      -5/2 * y = -5\n      y = 2\n\n3. From the first row, we have x + 3/4 * y - 1/4 * z = 3/2. Since y = 2 and z = 0, we can solve for x:\n\n      x + 3/4 * 2 = 3/2\n      x + 3/2 = 3/2\n      x = 0\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of equations are x = 0, y = 2, and z = 0."
