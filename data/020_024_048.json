However, for every $5 increase in price, the demand decreases by 50 units. What is the optimal price that the company should charge to maximize their revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the price per unit as P and the number of units sold as Q. We are given that when P = $80, Q = 500. We are also given that for every $5 increase in price, the demand decreases by 50 units. \n\nWe can express this relationship as follows:\n\nQ = 500 - 50 * (P - 80) / 5\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nQ = 500 - 10 * (P - 80)\n\nNow, we want to find the optimal price P to maximize revenue. Revenue (R) is the product of price (P) and quantity (Q):\n\nR = P * Q\n\nSubstitute the expression for Q from above:\n\nR = P * (500 - 10 * (P - 80))\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\nR = 500P - 10P^2 + 8000\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and to find the maximum revenue, we need to find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex (in this case, the optimal price P) can be found using the formula:\n\nP = -b / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = -10 and b = 500:\n\nP = -500 / (2 * -10)\n\nP = 500 / 20\n\nP = $25\n\nHowever, this result indicates the change in price from the initial price of $80. So, the optimal price is:\n\nOptimal Price = Initial Price + Change in Price\n\nOptimal Price = $80 + $25\n\nOptimal Price = $105\n\nTherefore, the company should charge $105 per unit to maximize their revenue."
