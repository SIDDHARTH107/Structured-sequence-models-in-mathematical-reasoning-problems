    "message_2": "To find the dimensions of the cylindrical can with minimum surface area, we will use the formula for the volume of a cylinder and the formula for the surface area of a cylinder. Let the radius of the cylinder be r and the height be h.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, and the surface area is given by the formula A = 2πrh + 2πr^2.\n\nWe are given that the volume of the cylinder is 300 cubic meters, so we have:\n\n300 = πr^2h\n\nWe want to minimize the surface area, so we need to express the surface area formula in terms of one variable. We can do this by solving the volume formula for h and substituting it into the surface area formula:\n\nh = 300 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area formula:\n\nA = 2πr(300 / (πr^2)) + 2πr^2\nA = 600/r + 2πr^2\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = -600/r^2 + 4πr\n\nSetting dA/dr = 0:\n\n0 = -600/r^2 + 4πr\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\n600/r^2 = 4πr\nr^3 = 600 / (4π)\nr^3 = 150 / π\nr ≈ 2.919\n\nNow, we can find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 300 / (π(2.919)^2)\nh ≈ 2.919\n\nSo, the dimensions of the cylindrical can with minimum surface area are approximately r ≈ 2.919 meters and h ≈ 2.919 meters."
