    "message_2": "To find f(i), we will use Liouville's Theorem, which states that a bounded entire function (holomorphic throughout the complex plane) must be constant.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequality as:\n\n|f(z)| ≤ 6|z|^2 + 5\n\nNow, consider the function g(z) = f(z) / (6z^2 + 1). This function is also holomorphic throughout the complex plane since f(z) is holomorphic and the denominator (6z^2 + 1) is never zero.\n\nWe can now find an upper bound for |g(z)|:\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z) / (6z^2 + 1)| ≤ (6|z|^2 + 5) / (6|z|^2 + 1)\n\nAs |z| goes to infinity, the ratio (6|z|^2 + 5) / (6|z|^2 + 1) approaches 1. Therefore, |g(z)| is bounded.\n\nBy Liouville's Theorem, g(z) must be a constant function. Let's denote this constant as C, so g(z) = C for all z.\n\nNow, we can find f(z) by multiplying g(z) by the denominator:\n\nf(z) = g(z) * (6z^2 + 1) = C * (6z^2 + 1)\n\nFinally, we can find f(i) by substituting z = i:\n\nf(i) = C * (6i^2 + 1) = C * (6(-1) + 1) = C * (-5)\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the value of C, we can only express f(i) in terms of C:\n\nf(i) = -5C"
