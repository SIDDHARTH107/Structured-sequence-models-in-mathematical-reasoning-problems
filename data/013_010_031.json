    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly where two firms produce identical goods. Firm A has a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit, while Firm B's marginal cost is given by MC_B = 0.5Q_B, where Q_B is the quantity produced by Firm B. If the market demand is P = 50 - Q, where Q = Q_A + Q_B, determine the Nash equilibrium of the Cournot competition.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium of the Cournot competition, we first need to find the reaction functions of both firms. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity a firm should produce given the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nLet's start with Firm A. Firm A's profit function is given by:\n\nπ_A = (P - MC_A) * Q_A = (50 - Q - 10) * Q_A = 40Q_A - Q_A^2 - Q_A*Q_B\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm A will choose Q_A such that the first derivative of π_A with respect to Q_A is equal to zero:\n\nd(π_A)/dQ_A = 40 - 2Q_A - Q_B = 0\n\nSolving for Q_A, we get Firm A's reaction function:\n\nQ_A = (40 - Q_B) / 2\n\nNow let's find Firm B's reaction function. Firm B's profit function is given by:\n\nπ_B = (P - MC_B) * Q_B = (50 - Q - 0.5Q_B) * Q_B = 50Q_B - Q_B^2 - Q_A*Q_B\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm B will choose Q_B such that the first derivative of π_B with respect to Q_B is equal to zero:\n\nd(π_B)/dQ_B = 50 - 2Q_B - Q_A = 0\n\nSolving for Q_B, we get Firm B's reaction function:\n\nQ_B = (50 - Q_A) / 2\n\nNow we can find the Nash equilibrium by solving the system of equations formed by the reaction functions:\n\nQ_A = (40 - Q_B) / 2\nQ_B = (50 - Q_A) / 2\n\nFirst, let's solve for Q_A in terms of Q_B:\n\nQ_A = (40 - Q_B) / 2\n\nNow substitute this expression for Q_A into the second equation:\n\nQ_B = (50 - ((40 - Q_B) / 2)) / 2\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nQ_B = (100 - 40 + Q_B) / 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4Q_B = 60 + Q_B\n\nSubtract Q_B from both sides:\n\n3Q_B = 60\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nQ_B = 20\n\nNow substitute Q_B back into the equation for Q_A:\n\nQ_A = (40 - 20) / 2\n\nQ_A = 10\n\nSo the Nash equilibrium of the Cournot competition is (Q_A, Q_B) = (10, 20)."
