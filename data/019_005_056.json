    "message_1": "Here is an Epistemic logic question for a math student:\n\nSuppose there are three closed boxes labeled A, B, and C. One of them contains a prize of $100, and the other two boxes are empty. You do not know which box contains the prize. You are given the following information:\n\nBox A does not contain the prize.\nThe person who labeled Box B mistakenly labeled it as Box A.\nBox C is labelled correctly.\n\nWhat is the probability that Box B contains the prize?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. Box A does not contain the prize.\n2. Box B is mistakenly labeled as Box A.\n3. Box C is labeled correctly.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the prize is either in Box B or Box C. \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Box B is labeled as Box A. Since there can't be two boxes labeled as A, this means that the actual Box A is labeled as Box B. \n\nFrom the third statement, we know that Box C is labeled correctly, so it is indeed Box C.\n\nNow, we have two possibilities for the prize location: Box B (labeled as A) and Box C (labeled correctly). Since there are only two possibilities, the probability of the prize being in Box B is 1/2 or 50%."
