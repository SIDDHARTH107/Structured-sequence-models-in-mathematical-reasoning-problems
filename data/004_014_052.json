    "message_1": "A conical container has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 5 cm at the base. If water is poured into the container at a rate of 2 cubic cm per second, find how long it takes for the container to be filled. (Hint: Volume of a cone = 1/3 * pi * r^2 * h)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the volume of the conical container using the formula given:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nVolume = (1/3) * pi * (5 cm)^2 * (10 cm)\nVolume = (1/3) * pi * 25 cm^2 * 10 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * pi * 250 cm^3\nVolume ≈ 261.8 cm^3\n\nNow, we know that water is being poured into the container at a rate of 2 cm^3 per second. To find out how long it takes to fill the container, we can divide the volume of the container by the rate at which water is being poured:\n\nTime = Volume / Rate\nTime = 261.8 cm^3 / 2 cm^3/s\nTime ≈ 130.9 seconds\n\nSo, it takes approximately 130.9 seconds to fill the conical container."
