    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you have a group of 50 individuals who are all diagnosed with a particular disease. Survival analysis shows that the survival probability of individuals after the diagnosis of the disease is given by S(t) = e^(-0.02t), where t is the time in years since diagnosis. \nWhat is the probability that an individual with this disease will survive for at least 3 years after diagnosis?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that an individual with this disease will survive for at least 3 years after diagnosis, we need to plug in t = 3 into the survival probability function S(t) = e^(-0.02t).\n\nS(3) = e^(-0.02 * 3) = e^(-0.06)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of e^(-0.06).\n\nS(3) â‰ˆ 0.941764\n\nSo, the probability that an individual with this disease will survive for at least 3 years after diagnosis is approximately 0.941764 or 94.18%."
