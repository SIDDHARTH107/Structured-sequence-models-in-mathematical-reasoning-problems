    "message_2": "To find the average speed of the car, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nIn this case, the total distance is 96 miles and the total time is 2 hours. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nAverage speed = 96 miles / 2 hours\n\nAverage speed = 48 miles per hour (mph)\n\nThe average speed of the car is 48 mph."
