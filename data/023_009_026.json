    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. Let's denote the Fourier transform of y(x) as Y(k), then we have:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{y''(x) - 4y(x) = 2\\}$$\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we know that the Fourier transform of the second derivative is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{y''(x)\\} = (ik)^2Y(k) = -k^2Y(k)$$\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given differential equation becomes:\n\n$$-k^2Y(k) - 4Y(k) = 2$$\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(k):\n\n$$Y(k) = \\frac{2}{k^2 + 4}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(k) to get y(x):\n\n$$y(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Y(k)\\}$$\n\n$$y(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2}{k^2 + 4}\\right\\}$$\n\nUsing the inverse Fourier transform formula, we have:\n\n$$y(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{k^2 + 4} e^{ikx} dk$$\n\nThis integral can be solved using the residue theorem or by recognizing it as a standard integral involving the sine and cosine functions. The result is:\n\n$$y(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{k^2 + 4} \\cos(kx) dk = \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2x}$$\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. y(0) = 0:\n\n$$y(0) = \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2\\cdot 0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\Rightarrow \\text{Contradicts the given boundary condition}$$\n\n2. y(Ï€) = 3:\n\n$$y(\\pi) = \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2\\pi} \\Rightarrow \\text{Contradicts the given boundary condition}$$\n\nThe solution we found does not satisfy the given boundary conditions. This indicates that the problem is not well-posed for the Fourier transform method. The given boundary value problem might require a different approach, such as the method of eigenfunctions or the method of Green's functions."
