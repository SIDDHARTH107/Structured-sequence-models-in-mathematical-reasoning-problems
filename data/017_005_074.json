    "message_2": "To find all possible groups of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must divide 27 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27. However, if n_3 = 27, then there would be 27 Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 3, which is not possible since the group G has only 27 elements. Therefore, n_3 = 1, and G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say P.\n\nSince P is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, it must be normal in G. Now, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: P is cyclic.\nIf P is cyclic, then it is generated by an element of order 27, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_27.\n\nCase 2: P is not cyclic.\nIf P is not cyclic, then it must be a non-cyclic group of order 27. Since the order of P is a prime power (3^3), P is a p-group, and its center Z(P) is nontrivial. The order of Z(P) must be a power of 3, so |Z(P)| = 3 or |Z(P)| = 9.\n\nIf |Z(P)| = 3, then P/Z(P) is a group of order 9, which is isomorphic to either Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. If P/Z(P) is isomorphic to Z_9, then P is isomorphic to Z_3 ⋊ Z_9, which is a semidirect product of Z_3 and Z_9. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIf P/Z(P) is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3, then P is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3. However, this is not possible since P is a group of order 27 and Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3 has order 81.\n\nIf |Z(P)| = 9, then Z(P) is a normal subgroup of P of order 9. Since P is a group of order 27, there exists an element x in P such that x is not in Z(P). Let H = ⟨x⟩, then |H| = 3. Now, we have P = Z(P) × H, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 27 is isomorphic to either a cyclic group or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
