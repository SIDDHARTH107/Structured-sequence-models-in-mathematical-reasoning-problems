    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nwhere f1(x, y) = x^2 + xy - 10 and f2(x, y) = y + 3xy^2 - 57.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x + y\n∂f1/∂y = x\n∂f2/∂x = 3y^2\n∂f2/∂y = 1 + 6xy\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x + y   x  |\n          | 3y^2    1 + 6xy |\n\nNow, we need to choose an initial guess for the solution (x0, y0). Let's use (x0, y0) = (1, 1) as our initial guess. We will then iterate using the following formula:\n\n(x_n+1, y_n+1) = (x_n, y_n) - J(x_n, y_n)^(-1) * F(x_n, y_n)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the vector of the functions [f1(x, y), f2(x, y)].\n\nWe will iterate until the difference between consecutive approximations is less than 10^(-4).\n\nIteration 1:\nInitial guess (x0, y0) = (1, 1)\n\nJ(x0, y0) = | 3  1 |\n            | 3  7 |\n\nF(x0, y0) = [-8, -53]\n\nJ(x0, y0)^(-1) = | 7/18  -1/18 |\n                | -1/6   1/6  |\n\nJ(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0) = [31/6, -17/6]\n\n(x1, y1) = (1, 1) - [31/6, -17/6] = (-29/6, 23/6)\n\nIteration 2:\n(x1, y1) = (-29/6, 23/6)\n\nJ(x1, y1) = | -19/6  -29/6 |\n            | 529/36  23/6 |\n\nF(x1, y1) = [0.000185, -0.000370]\n\nJ(x1, y1)^(-1) = | -23/6  -29/6 |\n                | -529/36  -19/6 |\n\nJ(x1, y1)^(-1) * F(x1, y1) = [0.000123, -0.000246]\n\n(x2, y2) = (-29/6, 23/6) - [0.000123, -0.000246] = (-4.8334, 3.8331)\n\nThe difference between consecutive approximations is less than 10^(-4), so we can stop here.\n\nThe solution accurate to four decimal places is (x, y) = (-4.8334, 3.8331)."
