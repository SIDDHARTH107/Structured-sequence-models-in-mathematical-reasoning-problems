    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 5, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(10x)/dx + d(5)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3(2x^(2-1)) - 10(1x^(1-1)) + 0\nf'(x) = 6x - 10\n\nNow, we will find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 10\nf'(2) = 12 - 10\nf'(2) = 2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 5 at x = 2 is 2."
