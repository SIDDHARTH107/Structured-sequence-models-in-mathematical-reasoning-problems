    "message_2": "To find the horizontal component of the force, we can use the following formula:\n\nHorizontal component = Force × cos(angle)\n\nwhere Force = 20 N and angle = 30 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nangle (in radians) = (angle in degrees) × (π / 180)\nangle (in radians) = 30 × (π / 180) = π / 6\n\nNow, we can find the horizontal component of the force:\n\nHorizontal component = 20 N × cos(π / 6)\nHorizontal component ≈ 20 N × 0.866\nHorizontal component ≈ 17.32 N\n\nSo, the horizontal component of the force is approximately 17.32 N."
