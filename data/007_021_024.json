    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient probabilistic method for finding a nontrivial factor of a composite number. We will use the function f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod n) as our iteration function. Let's start with x_1 = f(2) and y_1 = f(f(2)).\n\nStep 1:\nx_1 = f(2) = (2^2 + 1) mod 1234567 = 5\ny_1 = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 1234567 = 26\ngcd(1234567, |5 - 26|) = gcd(1234567, 21) = 3\n\nWe found a nontrivial factor of 1234567, which is 3. To find the other factor, we can divide 1234567 by 3:\n\n1234567 / 3 = 411522\n\nSo, the nontrivial factors of 1234567 are 3 and 411522."
