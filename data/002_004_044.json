    "message_1": "A rectangular field has a length of 75 meters and a width of 40 meters. What is the perimeter of the rectangular field?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).\n\nIn this case, the length is 75 meters and the width is 40 meters. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(75 + 40)\nPerimeter = 2(115)\nPerimeter = 230 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangular field is 230 meters."
