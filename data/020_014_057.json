    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of cardboard used, we need to find the dimensions of the box that minimize the surface area while maintaining a volume of 20 cubic meters. Let the dimensions of the box be length (L), width (W), and height (H). We have the following equations:\n\nVolume: V = L * W * H = 20\nSurface Area: S = 2(LW + WH + LH)\n\nWe need to minimize S subject to the constraint V = 20. To do this, we can first solve the volume equation for one of the variables, say H:\n\nH = 20 / (L * W)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for H into the surface area equation:\n\nS = 2(LW + W(20 / (L * W)) + L(20 / (L * W)))\nS = 2(LW + 20/L + 20/W)\n\nNow we have a function of two variables, S(L, W), that we want to minimize. To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives with respect to L and W and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂S/∂L = 2(W - 20/(L^2)) = 0\n∂S/∂W = 2(L - 20/(W^2)) = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we have W = 20/(L^2). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nL - 20/((20/(L^2))^2) = 0\nL^5 - 20^3 = 0\n\nNow we need to solve for L:\n\nL^5 = 20^3\nL = (20^3)^(1/5)\nL ≈ 2.7144\n\nNow we can find W:\n\nW = 20/(L^2)\nW ≈ 20/(2.7144^2)\nW ≈ 2.7144\n\nSince the box is rectangular, H can be found using the volume equation:\n\nH = 20 / (L * W)\nH ≈ 20 / (2.7144 * 2.7144)\nH ≈ 2.7144\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the amount of cardboard used are approximately L = 2.7144 meters, W = 2.7144 meters, and H = 2.7144 meters."
