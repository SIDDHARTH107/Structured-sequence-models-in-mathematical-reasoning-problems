    "message_2": "In a substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a corresponding letter in the ciphertext. To find the decryption key, we need to determine the shift between the original letters and the encrypted letters.\n\nLet's compare the positions of the letters in the alphabet:\n\nH -> U: H is the 8th letter, and U is the 21st letter. The shift is 21 - 8 = 13.\nE -> R: E is the 5th letter, and R is the 18th letter. The shift is 18 - 5 = 13.\nL -> Y: L is the 12th letter, and Y is the 25th letter. The shift is 25 - 12 = 13.\nL -> Y: L is the 12th letter, and Y is the 25th letter. The shift is 25 - 12 = 13.\nO -> B: O is the 15th letter, and B is the 2nd letter. Since we wrap around the alphabet, we can calculate the shift as (2 + 26) - 15 = 13.\n\nIn all cases, the shift is 13 positions. Therefore, the decryption key is a shift of 13 positions backward in the alphabet. This is known as the Caesar cipher with a key of 13, or the ROT13 cipher."
