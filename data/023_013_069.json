    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 10 cm and cross-sectional area 1 cm² dissipates heat at a rate of 10 W/cm³. If the initial temperature of the rod is 50°C and the heat is lost through both ends of the rod, calculate the temperature distribution along the rod after 5 minutes using the Fourier Transform. Assume that the rod is homogeneous and has a specific heat capacity of 0.2 J/g°C.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature distribution along the rod at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material, which is given by:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c)\n\nHere, k is the thermal conductivity of the material, ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat capacity.\n\nWe are given the heat dissipation rate, which is 10 W/cm³. To find the thermal conductivity, we can use the formula:\n\nQ = -k * A * (dT/dx)\n\nwhere Q is the heat dissipation rate, A is the cross-sectional area, and dT/dx is the temperature gradient. Rearranging for k, we get:\n\nk = -Q / (A * (dT/dx))\n\nWe don't have enough information to directly calculate k, so we will proceed with the heat equation using the given heat dissipation rate.\n\nTo find the temperature distribution along the rod after 5 minutes, we will use the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform of the heat equation is given by:\n\n∂U/∂t = α * (2πf)² * U\n\nwhere U is the Fourier Transform of u(x, t), and f is the frequency variable in the Fourier domain.\n\nWe are given the initial temperature distribution, which is a constant 50°C. The Fourier Transform of a constant function is a Dirac delta function at f = 0:\n\nU(x, 0) = δ(f)\n\nNow, we can solve the transformed heat equation for U(x, t):\n\nU(x, t) = δ(f) * exp(-α * (2πf)² * t)\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier Transform, we get the temperature distribution u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[δ(f) * exp(-α * (2πf)² * t) * exp(2πifx) df]\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nu(x, t) = (1/(2π)) * exp(-α * (2π0)² * t) * exp(2πi0x) = exp(0) = 1\n\nSince the initial temperature was 50°C, the temperature distribution along the rod after 5 minutes is:\n\nu(x, t) = 50 * 1 = 50°C\n\nSo, the temperature distribution along the rod remains constant at 50°C after 5 minutes."
