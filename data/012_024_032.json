    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, we need to first check if the graph is planar or not. A graph is planar if it can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. We can use the Kuratowski's theorem to check for planarity, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nFor a graph with 10 vertices and 20 edges, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\n20 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n\n20 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds, but it does not guarantee that the graph is planar. We would need more information about the specific graph to determine if it contains a subdivision of K5 or K3,3.\n\nIf the graph is planar, then the genus is 0, as it can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. If the graph is not planar, we would need to find the minimum number of times the graph can be drawn on a surface with handles (like a torus) without any edges crossing. This minimum number of handles is the genus of the graph.\n\nWithout more information about the specific graph, we cannot definitively determine the genus."
