    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, the law of excluded middle (X or ~X) does not hold, and the law of non-contradiction (~X or X) does hold. However, the given proposition states that X or true = false. This is a contradiction because \"or\" is a disjunction, and a disjunction with \"true\" should always be true.\n\nSince the given proposition is contradictory, it is not possible to determine the value of (~X and X) or false within the framework of intuitionistic logic."
