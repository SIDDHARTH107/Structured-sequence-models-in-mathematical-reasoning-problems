    "message_2": "The Hilbert Curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The length of the Hilbert Curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * a\n\nwhere n is the order of the curve and a is the length of the sides of the initial square.\n\nFor a Hilbert Curve of order 5, we have n = 5. Assuming the length of the sides of the initial square is 1 unit (a = 1), we can calculate the length of the curve as follows:\n\nLength = (2^5 - 1) * 1\nLength = (32 - 1) * 1\nLength = 31 units\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert Curve of order 5 is 31 units."
