    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal structure formed by recursively subdividing a larger tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. At each level, the number of smaller tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of smaller tetrahedra in a Sierpinski tetrahedron of level 4, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = (4^0) + (4^1) + (4^2) + (4^3) + (4^4)\n\nwhere each term represents the number of smaller tetrahedra at each level (from level 0 to level 4).\n\nCalculating the terms:\n\n(4^0) = 1\n(4^1) = 4\n(4^2) = 16\n(4^3) = 64\n(4^4) = 256\n\nAdding the terms together:\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 = 341\n\nSo, 341 smaller tetrahedra are required to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron of level 4."
