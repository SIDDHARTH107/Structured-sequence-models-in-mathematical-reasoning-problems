    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G, we need to count the number of proper colorings of G using k colors. A proper coloring is an assignment of colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nThe given graph G has 5 vertices and the following edges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. We can represent this graph as follows:\n\n```\n1 -- 2 -- 4\n \\  /    /\n  \\/    /\n  3 -- 5\n```\n\nNow, let's find the chromatic polynomial P(k) of G. We will use the deletion-contraction method to find the chromatic polynomial.\n\n1. Remove edge (2,3) from G to get G1. The chromatic polynomial of G1 is P1(k) = k(k-1)^4, since G1 is a tree with 5 vertices.\n\n2. Contract edge (2,3) in G to get G2. The resulting graph G2 has 4 vertices and the following edges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)}. We can represent G2 as follows:\n\n```\n  1 -- 2 -- 4\n   \\  /    /\n    \\/    /\n     3 --/\n```\n\nG2 is a cycle graph with 4 vertices, so its chromatic polynomial is P2(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial P(k) of G using the deletion-contraction formula: P(k) = P1(k) - P2(k).\n\nP(k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n     = k(k-1)[(k-1)^3 - (k-2)(k-3)]\n     = k(k-1)[k^3 - 3k^2 + 3k - 1 - k^2 + 5k - 6]\n     = k(k-1)[k^3 - 4k^2 + 8k - 7]\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(k) = k(k-1)[k^3 - 4k^2 + 8k - 7]."
