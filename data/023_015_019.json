    "message_2": "The given function is:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(2πx/4)\n\nFirst, let's simplify the function:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(πx/2)\n\nNow, we'll use the Fourier transform method to find the amplitude and phase of the wave at a point x = 6 meters. The Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 2sin(πx/2). We'll integrate this function with respect to x:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[2sin(πx/2) * e^(-iωx)] dx\n\nTo find the amplitude and phase at x = 6 meters, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω):\n\nf(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[F(ω) * e^(iωx)] dω\n\nSince we're only interested in the value at x = 6 meters, we can plug in x = 6:\n\nf(6) = (1/2π) * ∫[F(ω) * e^(iω*6)] dω\n\nNow, we need to find F(ω) for our specific function. Since f(x) is a sine function, its Fourier transform will have a delta function at the frequency of the sine wave. The frequency of our sine wave is (π/2) radians per meter, so the Fourier transform will have a delta function at ω = (π/2):\n\nF(ω) = A * δ(ω - π/2)\n\nNow we can plug this back into our inverse Fourier transform equation:\n\nf(6) = (1/2π) * ∫[A * δ(ω - π/2) * e^(iω*6)] dω\n\nThe integral of a product of a delta function and another function is the value of the other function at the point where the delta function is non-zero. In this case, that point is ω = π/2:\n\nf(6) = (1/2π) * A * e^(i(π/2)*6)\n\nNow we can compare this result to our original function, f(x) = 2sin(πx/2), evaluated at x = 6:\n\nf(6) = 2sin(π*6/2) = 2sin(3π)\n\nSince sin(3π) = 0, we have:\n\nf(6) = 0\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for f(6):\n\n(1/2π) * A * e^(i(π/2)*6) = 0\n\nSince e^(i(π/2)*6) is non-zero, we can conclude that A = 0. This means that the amplitude of the wave at x = 6 meters is 0.\n\nAs for the phase, since the amplitude is 0, the phase is undefined at x = 6 meters."
