    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we first need to find all the divisors of the order of G, which is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For each divisor, we will find a subgroup of that order.\n\n1. The subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element of G. This subgroup is cyclic since it contains only one element.\n\n2. The subgroups of order 2 are generated by the elements of order 2. In a cyclic group, the element of order 2 is a^(n/2), where n is the order of the group. In this case, a^(12/2) = a^6. So, the subgroup of order 2 is {e, a^6}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element, a^6.\n\n3. The subgroups of order 3 are generated by the elements of order 3. In a cyclic group, the elements of order 3 are a^(n/3) and its powers, where n is the order of the group. In this case, a^(12/3) = a^4. So, the subgroup of order 3 is {e, a^4, a^8}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element, a^4.\n\n4. The subgroups of order 4 are generated by the elements of order 4. In a cyclic group, the elements of order 4 are a^(n/4) and its powers, where n is the order of the group. In this case, a^(12/4) = a^3. So, the subgroup of order 4 is {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element, a^3.\n\n5. The subgroups of order 6 are generated by the elements of order 6. In a cyclic group, the elements of order 6 are a^(n/6) and its powers, where n is the order of the group. In this case, a^(12/6) = a^2. So, the subgroup of order 6 is {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element, a^2.\n\n6. The subgroup of order 12 is the entire group G, which is generated by the element a. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element, a.\n\nIn conclusion, the subgroups of G are:\n- {e}\n- {e, a^6}\n- {e, a^4, a^8}\n- {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}\n- {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}\n- {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}\n\nEach of these subgroups is cyclic, as shown above."
