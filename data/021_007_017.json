    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x). \n\nf(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 6\n\nThe derivative f'(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 14x + 14\n\nNow, we will apply the Newton-Raphson formula iteratively:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nWe start with the initial guess x0 = 3:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\nx1 = 3 - (3^3 - 7*3^2 + 14*3 - 6) / (3*3^2 - 14*3 + 14)\nx1 = 3 - (27 - 63 + 42 - 6) / (27 - 42 + 14)\nx1 = 3 - (0) / (-1)\nx1 = 3\n\nSince x1 is the same as x0, we have already found the root within the given error tolerance of 0.001. Therefore, the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 6 is x = 3."
