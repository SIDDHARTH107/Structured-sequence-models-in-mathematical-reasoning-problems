    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 24, and 36, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n16 = 2^4\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n\n2. For each prime factor, choose the highest power that appears in any of the factorizations:\n2^4, 3^2\n\n3. Multiply these highest powers together:\nLCM = 2^4 * 3^2 = 16 * 9 = 144\n\nSo, the least common multiple of 16, 24, and 36 is 144."
