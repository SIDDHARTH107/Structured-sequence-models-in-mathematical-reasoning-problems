    "message_1": "A data set consists of 11 numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 20. Find the median and the mean absolute deviation of the data set using robust statistics.",
    "message_2": "To find the median of the data set, we first need to arrange the numbers in ascending order, which is already done. Since there are 11 numbers, the median will be the middle number, which is the 6th number in the list.\n\nMedian = 6\n\nNow, let's find the mean absolute deviation (MAD) using the median as the central value. To do this, we will calculate the absolute differences between each number and the median, then find the mean of these absolute differences.\n\n|2 - 6| = 4\n|3 - 6| = 3\n|4 - 6| = 2\n|5 - 6| = 1\n|6 - 6| = 0\n|6 - 6| = 0\n|7 - 6| = 1\n|8 - 6| = 2\n|9 - 6| = 3\n|10 - 6| = 4\n|20 - 6| = 14\n\nNow, let's find the mean of these absolute differences:\n\n(4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 14) / 11 = 34 / 11 â‰ˆ 3.09\n\nSo, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the data set using robust statistics is approximately 3.09."
