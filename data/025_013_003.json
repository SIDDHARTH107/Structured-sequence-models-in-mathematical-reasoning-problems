    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the algebraic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y.\n\nLet F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 5x - 7. Then, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 5\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (2, 3):\n\n∂F/∂x(2, 3) = -3(2)^2 - 5 = -3(4) - 5 = -12 - 5 = -17\n∂F/∂y(2, 3) = 2(3) = 6\n\nFinally, we can write the Jacobian matrix J_F at the point (2, 3) as:\n\nJ_F(2, 3) = | ∂F/∂x(2, 3)  ∂F/∂y(2, 3) |\n                 |      -17                 6      |\n\nSo, the Jacobian of the algebraic curve at the point (2, 3) is:\n\nJ_F(2, 3) = [ -17  6 ]"
