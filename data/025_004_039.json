    "message_2": "A smooth rational curve in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ is a curve that is isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$. The degree of a curve in projective space is the number of intersection points with a general hyperplane.\n\nFor a smooth rational curve in $\\mathbb{P}^n$, the degree is equal to the number of points at which the curve intersects a general hyperplane. Since the curve passes through $n-2$ general points, it must intersect the hyperplane at least $n-2$ times.\n\nHowever, a smooth rational curve in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ is always of degree 1. This is because the curve is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$, and the degree of a curve is invariant under isomorphism. Therefore, the degree of a smooth rational curve in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ passing through $n-2$ general points is 1."
