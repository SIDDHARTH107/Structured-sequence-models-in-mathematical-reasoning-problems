    "message_2": "A quadratic residue modulo a prime number p is an integer that is congruent to a perfect square modulo p. In other words, a number x is a quadratic residue modulo 17 if there exists an integer y such that x ≡ y^2 (mod 17).\n\nTo find the quadratic residues of 17, we can calculate the squares of the integers from 0 to 16 (half of 17) modulo 17 and list the unique results:\n\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 17)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n5^2 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n6^2 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n7^2 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n8^2 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n\nSince 17 is a prime number, we only need to check up to half of 17, as the remaining integers will produce the same residues.\n\nThe quadratic residues of 17 are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16}."
