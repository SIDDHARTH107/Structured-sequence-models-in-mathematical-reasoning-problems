Repeat steps 2-3 for the desired number of iterations.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the DE algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return np.sin(x) / x\n\ndef de_algorithm(pop_size, crossover_rate, mutation_factor, iterations, bounds):\n    # Step 1: Initialize the population\n    population = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=(pop_size, 1))\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            # Step 2: Mutate and crossover\n            a, b, c = population[np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)]\n            trial_vector = a + mutation_factor * (b - c)\n\n            # Crossover\n            if np.random.rand() < crossover_rate:\n                trial_vector = population[i] + (trial_vector - population[i]) * crossover_rate\n\n            # Ensure trial vector stays within bounds\n            trial_vector = np.clip(trial_vector, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n\n            # Step 3: Perform selection\n            if f(trial_vector) < f(population[i]):\n                population[i] = trial_vector\n\n    # Find the best solution in the final population\n    best_solution = population[np.argmin([f(x) for x in population])]\n\n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\npop_size = 20\ncrossover_rate = 0.9\nmutation_factor = 0.8\niterations = 100\nbounds = [1, 10]\n\nbest_solution, min_value = de_algorithm(pop_size, crossover_rate, mutation_factor, iterations, bounds)\n\nprint(\"Minimum value of the function: {:.6f}\".format(min_value[0]))\nprint(\"x value at the minimum: {:.6f}\".format(best_solution[0]))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum value of the function and the corresponding x value. Note that the DE algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, so the results may vary slightly between runs."
