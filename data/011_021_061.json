The distances between the cities are as follows: city 1 and 2 = 10km, city 1 and 3 = 15km, city 1 and 4 = 20km, city 1 and 5 = 25km, city 2 and 3 = 12km, city 2 and 4 = 18km, city 2 and 5 = 22km, city 3 and 4 = 10km, city 3 and 5 = 14km, and city 4 and 5 = 8km.

We can use the brute force method to find all possible routes and their distances, then choose the shortest one.\n\nThere are 5 cities, so there are (5-1)! = 4! = 24 possible routes.
