    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to the subtopic Moral Hazard in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose a company owner hires a risk-neutral employee to manage a certain project. The employee has the choice of putting in a lot of effort or a little effort. The owner doesn't know which effort level the employee chooses, but the effort level affects the project's success. If the project is successful, the owner makes a profit of $80,000. If it fails, the owner loses $20,000. The employee's effort level affects the probability of success as follows:\n\n- High effort: the project succeeds with probability 0.9\n- Low effort: the project succeeds with probability 0.4\n\nHowever, if the employee puts in high effort, they incur a personal cost of $10,000 (either in additional work or stress). If they put in low effort, they incur no personal cost. The employee only cares about their own net profit, which is the owner's profit minus their own cost. What effort level will the employee choose?\n\nPlease use game theory tools to find the optimal decision for the employee and the expected profit of the owner.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal decision for the employee, we need to calculate their expected net profit for both high effort and low effort choices.\n\n1. High Effort:\nExpected profit for the employee = (Probability of success * Owner's profit) - Personal cost\n= (0.9 * $80,000) - $10,000\n= $72,000 - $10,000\n= $62,000\n\n2. Low Effort:\nExpected profit for the employee = (Probability of success * Owner's profit) - Personal cost\n= (0.4 * $80,000) - $0\n= $32,000\n\nComparing the expected net profit for both choices, the employee will choose to put in high effort, as the expected net profit is higher ($62,000) compared to low effort ($32,000).\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit of the owner when the employee chooses high effort:\n\nExpected profit for the owner = (Probability of success * Owner's profit) + (Probability of failure * Owner's loss)\n= (0.9 * $80,000) + (0.1 * -$20,000)\n= $72,000 - $2,000\n= $70,000\n\nSo, the optimal decision for the employee is to put in high effort, and the expected profit of the owner is $70,000."
