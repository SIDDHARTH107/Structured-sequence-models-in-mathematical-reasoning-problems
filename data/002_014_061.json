    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together. There are six faces in total: two pairs of three different sizes.\n\n1. The area of the two faces with length and width (6 cm x 3 cm) = 18 cm² each. Total area for these two faces = 18 cm² x 2 = 36 cm².\n\n2. The area of the two faces with length and height (6 cm x 4 cm) = 24 cm² each. Total area for these two faces = 24 cm² x 2 = 48 cm².\n\n3. The area of the two faces with width and height (3 cm x 4 cm) = 12 cm² each. Total area for these two faces = 12 cm² x 2 = 24 cm².\n\nNow, add the total areas of all the faces together:\n\n36 cm² + 48 cm² + 24 cm² = 108 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 108 cm²."
