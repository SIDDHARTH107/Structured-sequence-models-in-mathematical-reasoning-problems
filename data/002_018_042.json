    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, its diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. Therefore, the radius (r) of the sphere is half of the edge length:\n\nr = 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm\n\nNow we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(4 cm)^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(64 cm^3)\n\nV ≈ 4.19 * 64 cm^3\n\nV ≈ 268.08 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 268.08 cubic centimeters, correct to two decimal places."
