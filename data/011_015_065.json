    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. We will denote the six people as A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nConsider person A. They have five relationships with the other five people (B, C, D, E, and F). Each of these relationships can be either a friendship or an enmity. Since there must be at least one pair of friends or enemies among any three people, we can conclude that A must have at least 3 friends or at least 3 enemies.\n\nCase 1: A has at least 3 friends.\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume A is friends with B, C, and D. Now, consider the relationships among B, C, and D. If any of them are friends, then we have a group of three people with at least one pair of friends (A, B, C, and D). If B, C, and D are all enemies with each other, then they form a group of three people with at least one pair of enemies. In either case, we have at least 3 pairs of friends (A-B, A-C, and A-D).\n\nCase 2: A has at least 3 enemies.\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume A is enemies with B, C, and D. Now, consider the relationships among B, C, and D. If any of them are enemies, then we have a group of three people with at least one pair of enemies (A, B, C, and D). If B, C, and D are all friends with each other, then they form a group of three people with at least one pair of friends. In either case, we have at least 3 pairs of friends (B-C, B-D, and C-D).\n\nIn both cases, we find that the minimum number of pairs of friends in this group of six people is 3."
