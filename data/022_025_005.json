    "message_2": "The Schrödinger equation for a one-dimensional system with potential $V(x) = x^2$ is given by:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + x^2\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$$\n\nwhere $\\psi(x)$ is the wave function, $E$ is the energy eigenvalue, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $m$ is the mass of the particle. To solve this equation, we can use the dimensionless variable $\\xi = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}}x$, which transforms the Schrödinger equation into:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi(\\xi)}{d\\xi^2} + (\\epsilon - \\xi^2)\\psi(\\xi) = 0$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}$. This is the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a quantum harmonic oscillator. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are well-known for this problem.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues are given by:\n\n$$E_n = \\hbar\\omega\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ and $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator, with $k$ being the force constant. In our case, $V(x) = x^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, so $k = 2$.\n\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are given by:\n\n$$\\psi_n(\\xi) = N_n H_n(\\xi) e^{-\\frac{\\xi^2}{2}}$$\n\nwhere $N_n$ is a normalization constant, and $H_n(\\xi)$ are the Hermite polynomials of order $n$. The first few Hermite polynomials are:\n\n$$H_0(\\xi) = 1$$\n$$H_1(\\xi) = 2\\xi$$\n$$H_2(\\xi) = 4\\xi^2 - 2$$\n$$H_3(\\xi) = 8\\xi^3 - 12\\xi$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n\nThe eigenfunctions must also satisfy the boundary conditions in the interval $[-2, 2]$, which in terms of $\\xi$ is $[-\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}}2, \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}}2]$. However, the eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator are valid for the entire real line, so they automatically satisfy the boundary conditions.\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation with potential $V(x) = x^2$ in the interval $[-2, 2]$ are given by:\n\nEigenvalues: $$E_n = \\hbar\\omega\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nEigenfunctions: $$\\psi_n(\\xi) = N_n H_n(\\xi) e^{-\\frac{\\xi^2}{2}}$$\n\nwhere $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$, $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$, and $H_n(\\xi)$ are the Hermite polynomials of order $n$."
