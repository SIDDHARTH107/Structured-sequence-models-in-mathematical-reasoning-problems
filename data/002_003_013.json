    "message_2": "The total surface area of a cube can be found using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 * (side length)^2\n\nIn this case, the side length is 5 cm. So the surface area is:\n\nSurface area = 6 * (5 cm)^2\nSurface area = 6 * 25 cm^2\nSurface area = 150 cm^2\n\nThe total surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
