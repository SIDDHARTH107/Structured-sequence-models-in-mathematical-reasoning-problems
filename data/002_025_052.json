    "message_1": "What is the length of the base of an isosceles triangle if the length of each of its two equal sides is 8 cm and the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the base of the isosceles triangle be x cm. Since the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm and the two equal sides are 8 cm each, we can set up the following equation:\n\n8 + 8 + x = 24\n\n16 + x = 24\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 24 - 16\nx = 8\n\nSo, the length of the base of the isosceles triangle is 8 cm."
