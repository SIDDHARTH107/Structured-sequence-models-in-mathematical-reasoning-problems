    "message_1": "A company's website receives an average of 2000 visitors per day. What is the probability that the website will receive at least 2500 visitors in a given day, assuming that the number of visitors follows a Poisson distribution?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the website will receive at least 2500 visitors in a given day, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of receiving fewer than 2500 visitors. Then, we can subtract this complementary probability from 1 to find the probability of receiving at least 2500 visitors.\n\nThe Poisson distribution formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere λ is the average number of visitors (2000), k is the number of visitors we want to find the probability for, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nTo find the complementary probability, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for receiving 0 to 2499 visitors:\n\nP(X < 2500) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 2499)\n\nCalculating this sum directly is computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Poisson distribution, which is available in many statistical software packages and programming languages.\n\nThe probability of receiving at least 2500 visitors is:\n\nP(X ≥ 2500) = 1 - P(X < 2500)\n\nUsing a statistical software or programming language to find the CDF for λ = 2000 and k = 2499, we get:\n\nP(X < 2500) ≈ 0.9834\n\nTherefore, the probability of receiving at least 2500 visitors is:\n\nP(X ≥ 2500) = 1 - 0.9834 ≈ 0.0166\n\nSo, there is approximately a 1.66% chance that the website will receive at least 2500 visitors in a given day."
