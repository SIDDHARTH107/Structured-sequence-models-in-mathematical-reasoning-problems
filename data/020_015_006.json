    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard measures 18 cm by 24 cm. A square of equal size is cut out from each corner and the resulting flaps are folded upwards to form an open box with a lid. What is the maximum volume of the box that can be formed in this way?",
    "message_2": "Let the side length of the square cut out from each corner be x cm. After folding the flaps, the dimensions of the open box will be (18-2x) cm by (24-2x) cm by x cm.\n\nThe volume V of the open box can be calculated as follows:\n\nV = (18-2x)(24-2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the volume function. To do this, we can find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the volume function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero.\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (18-2x)(24-2x)(1) + (18-2x)(-2)(x) + (24-2x)(-2)(x)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nV'(x) = -8x^3 + 84x^2 - 432x\n\nNow, we set V'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = -8x^3 + 84x^2 - 432x\n\nWe can factor out an x:\n\n0 = x(-8x^2 + 84x - 432)\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the quadratic part:\n\na = -8, b = 84, c = -432\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-84 ± √(84^2 - 4(-8)(-432))) / 2(-8)\n\nx = (-84 ± √(7056 - 13824)) / -16\n\nx = (-84 ± √(-6768)) / -16\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots for the quadratic part. Therefore, the only critical point is x = 0, which corresponds to not cutting out any squares from the corners. However, this doesn't result in a box, so we need to consider the constraints of the problem.\n\nSince the cardboard measures 18 cm by 24 cm, the maximum value of x cannot be greater than half of the smaller dimension (18 cm), which is 9 cm. However, as x approaches 9 cm, the height of the box approaches 0, resulting in a negligible volume.\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we can analyze the behavior of the volume function as x approaches the constraints. As x increases from 0 to 9 cm, the height of the box increases, but the length and width decrease. The volume function will have a maximum value when the rate of increase in height is balanced by the rate of decrease in length and width.\n\nIn practice, this maximum volume is often found by trial and error or by using optimization techniques. By testing different values of x, we can find that the maximum volume occurs when x is approximately 3 cm. This results in a box with dimensions (18-2x) cm by (24-2x) cm by x cm, or (12 cm by 18 cm by 3 cm).\n\nThe maximum volume of the box is:\n\nV = 12 cm × 18 cm × 3 cm = 648 cubic centimeters."
