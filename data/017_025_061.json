    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we first find the prime factorization of 120. We have:\n\n120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n\nNow we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is based on the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. The formula is:\n\nf(n) = (p_1 + 1)(p_2 + 1)...(p_k + 1)\n\nwhere p_i are the exponents in the prime factorization of n. In our case, we have:\n\nf(120) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 * 2 * 2 = 16\n\nHowever, this formula gives us an upper bound on the number of groups, and some of these groups may be isomorphic. To find the actual number of non-isomorphic groups, we need to consider the possible isomorphism classes.\n\nThere are 13 non-isomorphic groups of order 120. These groups can belong to the following isomorphism classes:\n\n1. C_120 (cyclic group)\n2. C_2 x C_60\n3. C_3 x C_40\n4. C_5 x C_24\n5. C_2 x C_2 x C_30\n6. C_2 x C_3 x C_20\n7. C_2 x C_5 x C_12\n8. C_2^3 x C_3 x C_5 (direct product of Sylow subgroups)\n9. A_5 (alternating group)\n10. S_3 x C_20 (semi-direct product)\n11. S_5 (symmetric group)\n12. SL(2,5) (special linear group)\n13. C_2 x A_5 (extension of A_5 by C_2)\n\nSo, there are 13 non-isomorphic groups of order 120, and they can belong to the isomorphism classes listed above."
