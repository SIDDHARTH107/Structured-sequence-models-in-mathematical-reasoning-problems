The antiderivative of 3x^2:\n   Apply the power rule: (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\n2. The antiderivative of -4x:\n   Apply the power rule: (-4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-4x^2)/2 = -2x^2\n\n3. The antiderivative of 5:\n   Since 5 is a constant, its antiderivative is 5x (the derivative of 5x with respect to x is 5).\n\nNow, combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration (C):\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + C"
