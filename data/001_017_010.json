    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the property of logarithms that states log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b). \n\nSo, we have:\n\nlog(base 2)(x) + log(base 2)(x - 6) = log(base 2)(x * (x - 6)) = 3\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithms since they have the same base:\n\nx * (x - 6) = 2^3\n\nx * (x - 6) = 8\n\nNow, expand the equation:\n\nx^2 - 6x = 8\n\nMove all terms to one side to set the equation to 0:\n\nx^2 - 6x - 8 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 4 = 0 => x = 4\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation:\n\nFor x = 4:\nlog(base 2)(4) + log(base 2)(4 - 6) = 2 + log(base 2)(-2)\n\nSince we cannot have a logarithm of a negative number, x = 4 is not a valid solution.\n\nFor x = 2:\nlog(base 2)(2) + log(base 2)(2 - 6) = 1 + log(base 2)(-4)\n\nAgain, we cannot have a logarithm of a negative number, so x = 2 is also not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, there are no valid solutions for x in the given equation."
