    "message_1": "In a set of 50 data points, the mean is 70 and the standard deviation is 10. If an outlier is defined as any data point that is more than three standard deviations away from the mean, how many outliers are there in the data set?",
    "message_2": "To find the range of values that are not considered outliers, we can calculate the values that are three standard deviations away from the mean.\n\nMean - 3 * Standard Deviation = 70 - 3 * 10 = 70 - 30 = 40\nMean + 3 * Standard Deviation = 70 + 3 * 10 = 70 + 30 = 100\n\nSo, any data point below 40 or above 100 is considered an outlier. To determine the number of outliers in the data set, we would need to know the individual data points. Without that information, we cannot determine the exact number of outliers."
