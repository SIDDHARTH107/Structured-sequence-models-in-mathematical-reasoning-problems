Semi-direct product of Z_16 and Z_2\n5. Semi-direct product of Z_8 and Z_4\n6. Semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_4 and Z_2\n\nIt is not feasible to list the entire multiplication tables for each of these groups here, as each table would be 32x32, resulting in a total of 1024 entries per table. However, I can provide a brief description of each group and their isomorphisms.\n\n1. Dihedral group D_16: This group consists of the symmetries of a regular 16-gon, including rotations and reflections. It has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^(-1)b⟩.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q_32: This group is an extension of the quaternion group of order 8. It has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^2 = a^8, ba = a^(-1)b⟩.\n\n3. Generalized Quaternion group QD_32: This group is a further extension of the quaternion group. It has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^32 = 1, b^2 = a^16, ba = a^(-1)b⟩.\n\n4. Semi-direct product of Z_16 and Z_2: This group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of the cyclic group of order 16 and the cyclic group of order 2. It has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^(-1)b⟩.\n\n5. Semi-direct product of Z_8 and Z_4: This group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of the cyclic group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 4. It has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^4 = 1, ba = a^(-1)b⟩.\n\n6. Semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_4 and Z_2: This group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and the cyclic group of order 2. It has a presentation ⟨a, b, c | a^4 = b^4 = c^2 = 1, ba = a^(-1)b, ca = a^(-1)c, cb = b^(-1)c⟩.\n\nIsomorphisms:\n- D_16 is isomorphic to the semi-direct product of Z_16 and Z_2.\n- Q_32 is isomorphic to the generalized quaternion group QD_32.\n- The semi-direct product of Z_8 and Z_4 is not isomorphic to any of the other groups.\n- The semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_4 and Z_2 is not isomorphic to any of the other groups."
