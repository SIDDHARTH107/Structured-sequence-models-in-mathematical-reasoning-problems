    "message_2": "To determine if G and H are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of G and H such that the adjacency between the vertices is preserved.\n\nHowever, we can quickly conclude that G and H are not isomorphic because they have a different number of edges. G has 7 edges, while H has 8 edges. Since the number of edges is an invariant property under isomorphism, two graphs with a different number of edges cannot be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, G and H are not isomorphic, and there is no mapping between the vertices of G and H that preserves adjacency."
