    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 from x = 0 to x = 5, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 5.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 1) dx = (1/3)x^3 + x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 5:\n\n[(1/3)(5)^3 + (5)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + (0)]\n\n= [(1/3)(125) + 5] - [0]\n\n= [41.67 + 5] - [0]\n\n= 46.67\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 from x = 0 to x = 5 is 46.67 square units."
