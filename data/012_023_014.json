    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. In other words, a clique is a complete subgraph of the original graph.\n\nLet's consider the graph G with 8 vertices and the degree of each vertex is 4. To find the maximum size of a clique in this graph, we can use the Turán's theorem.\n\nTurán's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in an undirected graph with n vertices that does not contain a clique of size r+1 is given by:\n\nT(n, r) = (r-1) * n^2 / (2*r)\n\nIn our case, we want to find the maximum size of a clique, so we need to find the smallest r for which T(8, r) is less than or equal to the total number of edges in the graph.\n\nThe total number of edges in the graph can be calculated using the degree of each vertex:\n\nTotal number of edges = (8 * 4) / 2 = 16\n\nNow, we will test different values of r to find the smallest r for which T(8, r) is less than or equal to 16.\n\nFor r = 2:\nT(8, 2) = (2-1) * 8^2 / (2*2) = 16\n\nFor r = 3:\nT(8, 3) = (3-1) * 8^2 / (2*3) = 21.33 (rounded)\n\nSince T(8, 2) = 16, which is equal to the total number of edges in the graph, the maximum size of a clique in the graph G is r = 2. However, this result corresponds to the case when the graph is a complete bipartite graph, which is not possible in our case because each vertex has a degree of 4.\n\nTherefore, we need to consider the next smallest value of r, which is r = 3. This means that the maximum size of a clique in the graph G is 3."
