    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. Alice uses a prime number p = 23 and a primitive root g = 5 as public parameters. Alice chooses a secret integer a = 6 and computes the value A = g^a mod p. Similarly, Bob chooses a secret integer b = 15 and computes the value B = g^b mod p. Calculate the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to encrypt and decrypt their message.",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the values of A and B.\n\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 5^6 mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 8\n\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 5^15 mod 23\nB = 30517578125 mod 23\nB = 19\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using the following formulas:\n\nShared Secret Key (Alice) = B^a mod p\nShared Secret Key (Alice) = 19^6 mod 23\nShared Secret Key (Alice) = 47045881 mod 23\nShared Secret Key (Alice) = 2\n\nShared Secret Key (Bob) = A^b mod p\nShared Secret Key (Bob) = 8^15 mod 23\nShared Secret Key (Bob) = 35184372088832 mod 23\nShared Secret Key (Bob) = 2\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to encrypt and decrypt their message is 2."
