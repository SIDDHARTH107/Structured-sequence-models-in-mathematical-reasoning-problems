    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\n1. Top and bottom faces: Both faces are rectangles with dimensions 10 cm (length) and 6 cm (width). So, the area of each face is 10 cm × 6 cm = 60 cm². Since there are two of these faces, the total area for the top and bottom faces is 2 × 60 cm² = 120 cm².\n\n2. Front and back faces: Both faces are rectangles with dimensions 10 cm (length) and 4 cm (height). So, the area of each face is 10 cm × 4 cm = 40 cm². Since there are two of these faces, the total area for the front and back faces is 2 × 40 cm² = 80 cm².\n\n3. Left and right faces: Both faces are rectangles with dimensions 6 cm (width) and 4 cm (height). So, the area of each face is 6 cm × 4 cm = 24 cm². Since there are two of these faces, the total area for the left and right faces is 2 × 24 cm² = 48 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together: 120 cm² (top and bottom) + 80 cm² (front and back) + 48 cm² (left and right) = 248 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 248 cm²."
