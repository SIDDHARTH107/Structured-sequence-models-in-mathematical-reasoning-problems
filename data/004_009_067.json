    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x^2 - 3x\nv(x) = 4x^3 + 2x\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 - 3x)/dx = 4x - 3\nv'(x) = d(4x^3 + 2x)/dx = 12x^2 + 2\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we plug in the derivatives and original functions:\n\nf'(x) = (4x - 3)(4x^3 + 2x) + (2x^2 - 3x)(12x^2 + 2)\n\nNow, we expand and simplify:\n\nf'(x) = (4x - 3)(4x^3) + (4x - 3)(2x) + (2x^2)(12x^2) - (3x)(12x^2) + (2x^2)(2) - (3x)(2)\nf'(x) = 16x^4 - 12x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 24x^4 - 36x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x\n\nNow, we combine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = 16x^4 + 24x^4 - 12x^3 - 36x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x^2 - 6x - 6x\nf'(x) = 40x^4 - 48x^3 + 12x^2 - 12x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 40x^4 - 48x^3 + 12x^2 - 12x"
