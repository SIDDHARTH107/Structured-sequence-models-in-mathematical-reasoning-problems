    "message_1": "Suppose that you intercepted a Playfair cipher encrypted message consisting of 160 characters. Determine the number of possible Playfair keys that could have been used to encrypt this message.",
    "message_2": "A Playfair cipher uses a 5x5 grid filled with 25 distinct letters (usually the English alphabet without the letter 'J' or 'Q'). To determine the number of possible Playfair keys, we need to find the number of unique ways to arrange these 25 letters in the 5x5 grid.\n\nThere are 25! (25 factorial) ways to arrange the 25 letters in the grid. However, we need to account for the fact that the Playfair cipher is case-insensitive and the order of the rows and columns does not matter.\n\nTo account for the row order, we divide by 5! (5 factorial) since there are 5! ways to arrange the rows. Similarly, to account for the column order, we divide by 5! again.\n\nSo, the number of unique Playfair keys is:\n\n(25!) / (5! * 5!) = 53,130,728,000\n\nTherefore, there are 53,130,728,000 possible Playfair keys that could have been used to encrypt the 160-character message."
