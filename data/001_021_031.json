    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = 3.\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)² - 4(2)(3))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √1) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-5 + 1) / 4 = -1\nx = (-5 - 1) / 4 = -1.5\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0 are x = -1 and x = -1.5."
