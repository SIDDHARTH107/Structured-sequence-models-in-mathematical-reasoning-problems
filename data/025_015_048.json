    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the given surface at the point (1, -1, 2), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at this point. The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe given surface equation is:\nF(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4xz - 4yz + 6 = 0\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x - 4z\n∂F/∂y = 2y - 4z\n∂F/∂z = 2z - 4x - 4y\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, -1, 2):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, -1, 2) = 2(1) - 4(2) = -6\n∂F/∂y(1, -1, 2) = 2(-1) - 4(2) = -10\n∂F/∂z(1, -1, 2) = 2(2) - 4(1) - 4(-1) = 4\n\nSo, the gradient vector at the point (1, -1, 2) is <-6, -10, 4>.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the gradient vector <-6, -10, 4> and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point (1, -1, 2):\n\n-6(x - 1) - 10(y + 1) + 4(z - 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-6x + 6 - 10y - 10 + 4z - 8 = 0\n\nAnd finally, the equation of the tangent plane is:\n\n-6x - 10y + 4z = 12"
