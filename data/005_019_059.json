    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. It is known that 60% of the products produced are A, and 40% are B. The probability that a type A product is defective is 0.05 and the probability that a type B product is defective is 0.02. If a product is randomly selected from the factory, what is the probability that it is defective?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected product is defective, we can use the law of total probability. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event (in this case, a product being defective) is equal to the sum of the probabilities of that event occurring in each of the mutually exclusive scenarios (in this case, the product being type A or type B).\n\nLet D be the event that a product is defective, A be the event that a product is type A, and B be the event that a product is type B. We want to find P(D), the probability that a product is defective.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we have:\n\nP(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.6 (60% of the products are type A)\nP(B) = 0.4 (40% of the products are type B)\nP(D|A) = 0.05 (5% of type A products are defective)\nP(D|B) = 0.02 (2% of type B products are defective)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nP(D) = (0.05 * 0.6) + (0.02 * 0.4)\nP(D) = 0.03 + 0.008\nP(D) = 0.038\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected product is defective is 0.038 or 3.8%."
