    "message_2": "To find the probability of a hurricane occurring in a particular region, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of years with hurricanes) / (Total number of years)\n\nIn this case, the number of years with hurricanes is 25, and the total number of years is 200. So the probability is:\n\nProbability = 25 / 200\n\nProbability = 0.125\n\nThe probability of a hurricane occurring in the region is 0.125 or 12.5%."
