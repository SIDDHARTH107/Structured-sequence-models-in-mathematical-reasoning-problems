    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the space obtained by removing the point (2,6) from the circle, we will use the concept of homotopy and homotopy groups.\n\nLet's denote the circle with radius 5 centered at the point (2,3) as C and the point (2,6) as P. The space obtained by removing the point P from the circle C is denoted as X, i.e., X = C - {P}.\n\nNow, we want to compute the fundamental group of X, denoted as π_1(X).\n\nFirst, we observe that X is path-connected, meaning that for any two points in X, there exists a continuous path connecting them. This is because we have only removed one point from the circle, and the remaining space is still connected.\n\nNext, we will use the fact that the fundamental group of a path-connected space is independent of the choice of basepoint. So, we can choose any point on X as our basepoint. Let's choose the point (2,3) as our basepoint, denoted as x_0.\n\nNow, we want to find the set of homotopy classes of loops in X based at x_0. A loop in X is a continuous map f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = f(1) = x_0.\n\nWe can observe that any loop in X can be continuously deformed to a loop that goes around the missing point P a certain number of times. This number of times can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the direction of the loop. This means that the homotopy classes of loops in X can be represented by integers, where the integer n represents a loop that goes around the missing point P n times.\n\nNow, we can define a group operation on these integers, which is just the usual addition of integers. This operation is associative, has an identity element (0), and has inverses for each element (the inverse of n is -n).\n\nThus, the fundamental group of X, π_1(X), is isomorphic to the group of integers under addition, denoted as ℤ.\n\nSo, π_1(X) ≅ ℤ."
