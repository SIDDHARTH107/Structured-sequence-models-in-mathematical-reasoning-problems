    "message_1": "A Laplace transform of a function f(t) is given by the expression F(s) = (s - 1)/(s^2 + 4s + 3). Determine the inverse Laplace transform of F(s), i.e., find f(t).",
    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s), we first need to perform partial fraction decomposition on the given expression. The denominator of F(s) can be factored as follows:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 3 = (s + 1)(s + 3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite F(s) as the sum of two fractions:\n\nF(s) = A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 3)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by (s + 1)(s + 3):\n\n(s - 1) = A(s + 3) + B(s + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by substituting suitable values for s:\n\n1. Let s = -1:\n(-1 - 1) = A(-1 + 3) + B(-1 + 1)\n-2 = 2A\nA = -1\n\n2. Let s = -3:\n(-3 - 1) = A(-3 + 3) + B(-3 + 1)\n-4 = -2B\nB = 2\n\nNow we have:\n\nF(s) = -1/(s + 1) + 2/(s + 3)\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use the known inverse Laplace transforms of the individual terms:\n\nL^(-1){1/(s + a)} = e^(-at)\n\nSo,\n\nf(t) = L^(-1){F(s)} = L^(-1){-1/(s + 1) + 2/(s + 3)}\n\nf(t) = -e^(-t) + 2e^(-3t)\n\nThus, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is:\n\nf(t) = -e^(-t) + 2e^(-3t)"
