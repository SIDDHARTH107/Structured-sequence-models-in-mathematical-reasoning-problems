    "message_1": "A surface S is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 - 2z^2 = 1. Find the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1,1,0).",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface S by the function:\n\nF(u, v) = (u, v, sqrt((u^2 + v^2 - 1)/2))\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nF_u = (1, 0, u/sqrt(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1)))\nF_v = (0, 1, v/sqrt(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1)))\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nF_uu = (0, 0, (2v^2 - 1)/sqrt(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1))^3)\nF_uv = (0, 0, (2uv)/sqrt(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1))^3)\nF_vv = (0, 0, (2u^2 - 1)/sqrt(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1))^3)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = F_u • F_u = 1 + (u^2/(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1)))\nF = F_u • F_v = u*v/(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1))\nG = F_v • F_v = 1 + (v^2/(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1)))\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = F_uu • N = (2v^2 - 1)/sqrt(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1))^3\nM = F_uv • N = (2uv)/sqrt(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1))^3\nN = F_vv • N = (2u^2 - 1)/sqrt(2(u^2 + v^2 - 1))^3\n\nNow, we can compute the principal curvatures k1 and k2 using the formula:\n\nk1, k2 = (EG - F^2)^(1/2) ± L*G - 2*M*F + N*E / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,0), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the expressions for E, F, G, L, M, and N, we get:\n\nE = 2\nF = 1/2\nG = 2\nL = 1/4\nM = 1/4\nN = 1/4\n\nNow, we can compute the principal curvatures:\n\nk1, k2 = (4 - 1/4)^(1/2) ± (1/4 * 2 - 2 * 1/4 * 1/2 + 1/4 * 2) / (4 - 1/4)\nk1, k2 = sqrt(15/4) ± (1/2 - 1/4 + 1/2) / (15/4)\nk1, k2 = sqrt(15/4) ± 3/4\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,0) are:\n\nk1 = sqrt(15/4) + 3/4\nk2 = sqrt(15/4) - 3/4"
