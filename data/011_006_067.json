    "message_2": "To choose 3 different colored balls, you need to choose 1 red ball, 1 blue ball, and 1 green ball. \n\nThere are 5 ways to choose 1 red ball (out of 5 red balls), 4 ways to choose 1 blue ball (out of 4 blue balls), and 6 ways to choose 1 green ball (out of 6 green balls).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 different colored balls is:\n\n5 (ways to choose red) * 4 (ways to choose blue) * 6 (ways to choose green) = 120 ways."
