    "message_2": "To find the expected number of individuals with the medical condition, we can multiply the population size by the probability of the condition occurring.\n\nExpected number of individuals = Population size × Probability of the condition\nExpected number of individuals = 10,000 × 0.05\nExpected number of individuals = 500\n\nSo, in this population of 10,000, we can expect 500 individuals to have the medical condition."
