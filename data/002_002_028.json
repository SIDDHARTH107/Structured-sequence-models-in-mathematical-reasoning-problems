    "message_2": "To determine the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 10 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (10^3)\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 1000\nVolume = 4,186.67 cm^3 (approximately)\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 4,186.67 cm^3."
