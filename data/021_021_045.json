    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products A and B. The profit obtained for each product is given by $P_A(x)= 50x_A - 2x_A^2$ and $P_B(x)= 60x_B - 4x_B^2$, where $x_A$ and $x_B$ are the quantities of products A and B produced, respectively. The production capacity of the company is limited to 300 units. Determine the optimal values of $x_A$ and $x_B$ that maximize the total profit of the company. Use the cuckoo search algorithm to solve the problem numerically.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of n host nests (solutions) randomly. In this case, each nest represents a pair of values $(x_A, x_B)$, where $0 \\leq x_A, x_B \\leq 300$ and $x_A + x_B \\leq 300$.\n\n2. Fitness function: Define a fitness function to evaluate the quality of each solution. In this case, the fitness function is the total profit $P(x_A, x_B) = P_A(x_A) + P_B(x_B)$.\n\n3. Cuckoo search loop: Repeat the following steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy):\n\n   a. Choose a random nest and generate a new solution (cuckoo egg) by applying a random walk (Levy flight) to the chosen nest.\n   \n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution. If it is better than the worst nest in the population, replace the worst nest with the new solution.\n   \n   c. With a probability p, choose a random nest and replace it with a new random solution (simulating the discovery of the nest by a host bird).\n   \n   d. Evaluate the fitness of all nests and keep track of the best solution found so far.\n\n4. Output the best solution found.\n\nApplying the cuckoo search algorithm to this problem, we can find the optimal values of $x_A$ and $x_B$ that maximize the total profit of the company. The actual optimal values will depend on the random nature of the algorithm and the stopping criteria used. However, by running the algorithm multiple times and fine-tuning its parameters, we can obtain a good approximation of the true optimal solution."
