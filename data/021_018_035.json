Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution.\n4. Update the best solution found so far and the Tabu list.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet's start with an initial solution (x, y) = (0, 2) and an empty Tabu list.

However, this solution does not satisfy the constraint 2 ≤ y ≤ 3. In this case, the Tabu search algorithm did not find the true optimal solution within the given number of iterations. Increasing the number of iterations or adjusting the Tabu tenure may improve the algorithm's performance."
