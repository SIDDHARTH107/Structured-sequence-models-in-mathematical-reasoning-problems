    "message_2": "To find the intersection of A and B, we look for the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of A and B is {2, 5}.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this intersection is a subset of A and B. A subset is a set that contains only elements that are also in another set.\n\nThe intersection {2, 5} has elements that are also in set A, and there are no elements in the intersection that are not in set A. Therefore, the intersection is a subset of A.\n\nSimilarly, the intersection {2, 5} has elements that are also in set B, and there are no elements in the intersection that are not in set B. Therefore, the intersection is also a subset of B.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection of A and B, which is {2, 5}, is a subset of both A and B."
