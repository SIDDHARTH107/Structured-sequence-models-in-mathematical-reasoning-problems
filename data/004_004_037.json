    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curve y = x^2 - x and the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 3, we will use integration. The area can be found by integrating the function y = x^2 - x with respect to x from 0 to 3.\n\nArea = âˆ«(x^2 - x) dx from 0 to 3\n\nFirst, we need to find the antiderivative of the function x^2 - x.\n\nAntiderivative = (1/3)x^3 - (1/2)x^2 + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the antiderivative at the limits 0 and 3.\n\nAt x = 3:\n(1/3)(3^3) - (1/2)(3^2) = (1/3)(27) - (1/2)(9) = 9 - 4.5 = 4.5\n\nAt x = 0:\n(1/3)(0^3) - (1/2)(0^2) = 0\n\nNow, subtract the values obtained at the limits:\n\nArea = 4.5 - 0 = 4.5 square units\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curve y = x^2 - x and the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 3 is 4.5 square units."
