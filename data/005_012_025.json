    "message_1": "A math teacher wants to check the average height of students in their school. The school has 1000 students. The teacher can only measure the height of 100 students. Using random sampling, what is the minimum number of students the teacher should measure to estimate the average height of the whole school within 1 inch of accuracy, given a standard deviation of 4 inches?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the average height within 1 inch of accuracy, we can use the formula for the margin of error in a sample mean:\n\nMargin of Error = Z * (Standard Deviation / sqrt(Sample Size))\n\nwhere Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is approximately 1.96.\n\nWe want the margin of error to be within 1 inch, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1 = 1.96 * (4 / sqrt(Sample Size))\n\nNow, we can solve for the minimum sample size:\n\n1 / 1.96 = 4 / sqrt(Sample Size)\n0.5102 = 4 / sqrt(Sample Size)\nsqrt(Sample Size) = 4 / 0.5102\nsqrt(Sample Size) ≈ 7.84\n\nSquare both sides to find the sample size:\n\nSample Size ≈ 7.84^2\nSample Size ≈ 61.47\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a student, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nMinimum Sample Size = 62 students\n\nThe teacher should measure the height of at least 62 students to estimate the average height of the whole school within 1 inch of accuracy with a 95% confidence level."
