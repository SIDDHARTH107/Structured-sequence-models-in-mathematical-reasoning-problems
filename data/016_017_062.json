    "message_2": "The total length of the Heighway Dragon curve after its $n$ iterations can be found using the following formula:\n\nTotal Length = $L_n = L_{n-1} \\times \\sqrt{2}$\n\nwhere $L_n$ is the total length after $n$ iterations, and $L_{n-1}$ is the total length after $n-1$ iterations.\n\nFor the first iteration, the total length is $\\sqrt{2}$, as you mentioned. To find the total length for any $n$ iterations, we can apply the formula recursively:\n\n$L_1 = 1 \\times \\sqrt{2}$\n\n$L_2 = L_1 \\times \\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2}) \\times \\sqrt{2} = 2 + \\sqrt{2}$\n\n$L_3 = L_2 \\times \\sqrt{2} = (2 + \\sqrt{2}) \\times \\sqrt{2}$\n\nand so on.\n\nIn general, for the $n$-th iteration:\n\n$L_n = L_{n-1} \\times \\sqrt{2} = L_{n-2} \\times (\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\cdots = 1 \\times (\\sqrt{2})^n$\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon curve after its $n$ iterations is:\n\n$L_n = (\\sqrt{2})^n$"
