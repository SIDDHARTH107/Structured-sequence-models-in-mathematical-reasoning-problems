    "message_2": "To find the minimal resolution of singularities for the given algebraic variety, we first need to find the singular points of the variety. To do this, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y^2 - 4x - 4 = 0\n∂f/∂y = -6xy + 6y^2 + 8y - 4 = 0\n\nNow we need to solve this system of equations to find the singular points:\n\n(1) 3x^2 - 3y^2 - 4x - 4 = 0\n(2) -6xy + 6y^2 + 8y - 4 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite equation (1) as:\n\n3x^2 - 4x - 3y^2 - 4 = 0\nx(3x - 4) = 3y^2 + 4\nx = (3y^2 + 4) / (3x - 4)\n\nNow substitute this expression for x into equation (2):\n\n-6((3y^2 + 4) / (3x - 4))y + 6y^2 + 8y - 4 = 0\n\nNow we need to solve this equation for y. This is a complicated equation, and it is not easy to find a closed-form solution. However, we can use numerical methods or computer algebra systems to find the approximate solutions for y. Suppose we find the singular points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn).\n\nNext, we need to find a minimal resolution of singularities. This involves finding a proper birational morphism from a nonsingular variety to our original variety that resolves the singularities. One common method for finding such a resolution is to use a sequence of blow-ups at the singular points.\n\nFor each singular point (xi, yi), we perform a blow-up, which replaces the point with a projective space. We then analyze the strict transform of the variety and check if the singularities are resolved. If not, we continue with further blow-ups until all singularities are resolved.\n\nFinally, we obtain a nonsingular variety that is a minimal resolution of singularities for the given algebraic variety. Note that finding the minimal resolution of singularities can be a complex process, and it may require advanced techniques from algebraic geometry, such as the use of minimal models and the minimal model program."
