    "message_1": "Bob wants to send a secret message to Alice using RSA encryption. He chooses two prime numbers $p=11$ and $q=17$ and computes $n=pq=187$ and $\\phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)=160$. He chooses an encryption key $e=23$. Compute the corresponding decryption key $d$ using the extended Euclidean algorithm.",
    "message_2": "To find the decryption key $d$, we need to solve the following congruence for $d$:\n\n$ed \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\phi(n)}$\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n$23d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{160}$\n\nWe can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of $e$ modulo $\\phi(n)$. The extended Euclidean algorithm will give us integers $x$ and $y$ such that:\n\n$23x + 160y = \\gcd(23, 160)$\n\nSince $23$ and $160$ are coprime, their greatest common divisor is $1$. So, we have:\n\n$23x + 160y = 1$\n\nNow, we apply the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. Divide the larger number ($160$) by the smaller number ($23$):\n\n   $160 = 23 \\cdot 6 + 22$\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder:\n\n   $23 = 22 \\cdot 1 + 1$\n\n3. We have reached a remainder of $1$, so we can stop here. Now, we will work our way back up to express $1$ as a linear combination of $23$ and $160$:\n\n   $1 = 23 - 22 = 23 - (160 - 23 \\cdot 6) = 23 \\cdot 7 - 160$\n\nSo, we have $x = 7$ and $y = -1$. Since we are only interested in the modular inverse of $23$ modulo $160$, we can take $x = 7$ as the decryption key $d$:\n\n$d \\equiv 7 \\pmod{160}$\n\nThus, the decryption key $d$ is $7$."
