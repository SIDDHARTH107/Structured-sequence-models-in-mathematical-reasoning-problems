    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the particle, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time $t$. \n\nThe position function is given by: $x(t) = t^3 - 6t^2 + 9t$\n\nTaking the first derivative with respect to $t$, we get the velocity function:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = 3t^2 - 12t + 9$\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at $t=2$. Plugging in $t=2$ into the velocity function, we get:\n\n$v(2) = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 9 = 3(4) - 24 + 9 = 12 - 24 + 9 = -12 + 9 = -3$\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at $t=2$ is $-3$ m/s.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the particle. To do this, we need to find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time $t$. \n\nTaking the second derivative with respect to $t$, we get the acceleration function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} = \\frac{d(v(t))}{dt} = 6t - 12$\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at $t=2$. Plugging in $t=2$ into the acceleration function, we get:\n\n$a(2) = 6(2) - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0$\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle at $t=2$ is $0$ m/sÂ²."
