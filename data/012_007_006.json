    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or simply analyze the flow capacities in this case since the network is small.\n\n1. A -> B -> D: The bottleneck capacity in this path is the minimum capacity, which is min(10, 15) = 10 units.\n2. A -> C -> D: The bottleneck capacity in this path is the minimum capacity, which is min(20, 10) = 10 units.\n\nNow, we can add the bottleneck capacities of both paths to find the maximum flow from node A to node D:\n\nMaximum flow = 10 units (A -> B -> D) + 10 units (A -> C -> D) = 20 units."
