    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of length 10 cm and a height of 7 cm. The angle between the base and one of the legs of the triangle measures 45 degrees. Find the area of the triangle using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nIn this case, the base is 10 cm, the height is 7 cm, and the angle is 45 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\n45 degrees * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10 * 7 * sin(π/4)\n\nSince sin(π/4) = √2/2, we can simplify the expression:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10 * 7 * (√2/2)\n\nArea = 5 * 7 * (√2/2)\n\nArea = 35 * (√2/2)\n\nArea = 35√2 / 2\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 24.74 square centimeters."
