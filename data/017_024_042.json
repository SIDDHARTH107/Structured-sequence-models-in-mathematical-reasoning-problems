    "message_2": "First, let's find the prime factorization of the group order 96. We have:\n\n96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^1 = 3\n2. n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\nThe possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3.\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides 2^5 = 32\n2. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 16.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible isomorphism types for the group:\n\n1. Cyclic: If the group is cyclic, then it has a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of the group. In this case, we would have n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1. However, we know that n_2 can be either 1 or 3, so it is possible for the group to be cyclic.\n\n2. Direct product: If the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, then it would be isomorphic to a group of the form C_(2^5) x C_(3^1) = C_32 x C_3. In this case, we would have n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4. Since these values are possible, the group could be a direct product.\n\n3. Non-abelian: If the group is non-abelian, then it cannot be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and it must have more than one Sylow 2-subgroup or more than one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, we could have n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, 4, or 16. Since these values are possible, the group could be non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, the group of order 96 could be cyclic, a direct product, or non-abelian."
