    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, two players, A and B, have to choose how much money to give to each other. Player A can choose to give any amount between $0 to $10 to player B, and player B can choose to return any fraction of the amount received from player A. Let's say player A decides to give a certain amount of money to player B. If player B returns 100% of the received amount, player A gets twice the amount that was originally given to player B. However, if player B decides to return only a fraction of the amount, then player A ends up losing money.\n\nIf player A gives $5 to player B, and player B decides to return only 20% of the received amount, how much money does player A end up losing?",
    "message_2": "If player A gives $5 to player B, and player B returns only 20% of the received amount, we first need to calculate how much money player B returns to player A.\n\n20% of $5 is (20/100) * $5 = $1.\n\nSo, player B returns $1 to player A. Since player A initially gave $5 to player B, player A ends up losing:\n\n$5 - $1 = $4.\n\nPlayer A loses $4 in this situation."
