    "message_1": "In a Stackelberg competition with two firms, Firm 1 has a marginal cost of $20 per unit and Firm 2 has a marginal cost of $25 per unit. The market demand is given by Q = 500 - P, where Q is quantity and P is price. Firm 1 acts as the leader and sets its output first, followed by Firm 2 as the follower. What level of output and price will each firm choose under the Stackelberg equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction function for Firm 2, which is the best response of Firm 2 to the output chosen by Firm 1. We will do this by finding the profit-maximizing output for Firm 2 given Firm 1's output.\n\nLet q1 be the output of Firm 1 and q2 be the output of Firm 2. The total output in the market is Q = q1 + q2. From the market demand equation, we have P = 500 - Q = 500 - (q1 + q2).\n\nFirm 2's profit function is given by:\n\nπ2 = P * q2 - MC2 * q2 = (500 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 25 * q2\n\nTo find the profit-maximizing output for Firm 2, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q2 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ2/dq2 = 500 - 2*q2 - q1 - 25 = 0\n\nSolving for q2, we get Firm 2's reaction function:\n\nq2 = (475 - q1) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the profit-maximizing output for Firm 1, taking into account Firm 2's reaction function. Firm 1's profit function is given by:\n\nπ1 = P * q1 - MC1 * q1 = (500 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 20 * q1\n\nSubstitute Firm 2's reaction function into the profit function:\n\nπ1 = (500 - (q1 + (475 - q1) / 2)) * q1 - 20 * q1\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nπ1 = (500 - 475/2 + q1/2) * q1 - 20 * q1\n\nTake the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ1/dq1 = 500 - 475/2 + q1/2 - 20 = 0\n\nSolve for q1:\n\nq1 = (500 - 475/2 + 20) * 2 = 190\n\nNow, substitute q1 back into Firm 2's reaction function to find q2:\n\nq2 = (475 - 190) / 2 = 142.5\n\nFinally, we can find the equilibrium price by substituting q1 and q2 back into the market demand equation:\n\nP = 500 - (q1 + q2) = 500 - (190 + 142.5) = 167.5\n\nSo, under the Stackelberg equilibrium, Firm 1 will produce 190 units, Firm 2 will produce 142.5 units, and the market price will be $167.5 per unit."
