    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Applying the Fourier transform to signal processing:\n\n\"Suppose you are given a signal composed of a sum of three sine waves with frequencies of 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz, respectively. Use the Fourier transform to determine the magnitudes and phase angles of each of the sine waves in the signal if the amplitude of the signal is 100 V and the sampling rate is 100 Hz.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first represent the given signal as a sum of three sine waves with their respective frequencies. Then, we will apply the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the signal to determine the magnitudes and phase angles of each sine wave.\n\nLet the signal be represented as:\n\nx(t) = A1 * sin(2π * f1 * t + φ1) + A2 * sin(2π * f2 * t + φ2) + A3 * sin(2π * f3 * t + φ3)\n\nwhere A1, A2, and A3 are the amplitudes, f1 = 5 Hz, f2 = 10 Hz, and f3 = 20 Hz are the frequencies, and φ1, φ2, and φ3 are the phase angles of the sine waves.\n\nGiven that the amplitude of the signal is 100 V, we can assume that A1 + A2 + A3 = 100 V. However, we do not have enough information to determine the individual amplitudes. Therefore, we will proceed with the Fourier transform using the given frequencies and sampling rate.\n\nThe Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is given by:\n\nX(k) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2π * k * n / N)]\n\nwhere x(n) is the sampled signal, N is the number of samples, and X(k) is the DFT of the signal.\n\nSince the sampling rate is 100 Hz, the time interval between samples is T = 1/100 s. Let's take N = 100 samples for one period of the signal.\n\nNow, we will compute the DFT for the three frequencies of interest (k = 5, 10, and 20):\n\nX(5) = Σ [x(n * T) * e^(-j * 2π * 5 * n / 100)]\nX(10) = Σ [x(n * T) * e^(-j * 2π * 10 * n / 100)]\nX(20) = Σ [x(n * T) * e^(-j * 2π * 20 * n / 100)]\n\nAfter calculating the DFT for these frequencies, we can determine the magnitudes and phase angles of each sine wave:\n\nMagnitude: |X(k)| = sqrt(Re(X(k))^2 + Im(X(k))^2)\nPhase angle: φ(k) = atan2(Im(X(k)), Re(X(k)))\n\nwhere Re(X(k)) and Im(X(k)) are the real and imaginary parts of X(k), respectively.\n\nBy calculating the magnitudes and phase angles for X(5), X(10), and X(20), we can determine the magnitudes and phase angles of the sine waves in the signal. Note that due to the lack of information about the individual amplitudes, the results may not be unique."
