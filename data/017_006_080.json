    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has the order equal to the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nIn this case, we have two prime numbers, 5 and 7, so there are two possibilities for the structure of the group of order 35:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 35, denoted as Z_35.\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, denoted as Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nTo demonstrate that the group of order 35 is either cyclic or the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. By the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup in the group of order 35. Let's denote these subgroups as P_5 and P_7, respectively. The orders of these subgroups are 5 and 7.\n\n2. The Sylow Theorems also state that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) and the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n_7) must divide the order of the group (35) and be congruent to 1 modulo the respective prime. In this case, n_5 must divide 7 and n_7 must divide 5. The only possibility for both n_5 and n_7 is 1, which means that both P_5 and P_7 are normal subgroups.\n\n3. Since P_5 and P_7 are normal subgroups, their intersection is trivial (i.e., it contains only the identity element). This is because the orders of P_5 and P_7 are prime and their product is equal to the order of the group (35).\n\n4. Now, we can apply the following result: if G is a group with normal subgroups H and K such that their intersection is trivial and their product is equal to the order of G, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K. In our case, G is the group of order 35, H = P_5, and K = P_7. Therefore, G is isomorphic to P_5 × P_7, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 35 is either a cyclic group of order 35 (Z_35) or the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7 (Z_5 × Z_7)."
