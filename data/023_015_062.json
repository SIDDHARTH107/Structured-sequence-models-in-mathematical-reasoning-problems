Find the Fourier transform of the signal, and determine the frequencies that will be attenuated during propagation at a distance of 500 meters, assuming a propagation speed of 200,000 km/s and an attenuation constant of 0.1 Np/km at a frequency of 10 kHz.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal, we first need to identify the frequencies present in the signal. The signal is given by:\n\n$f(t) = \\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 10t) + 0.5\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 20t)$\n\nThis signal is a sum of two sinusoidal functions with frequencies 10 Hz and 20 Hz. The Fourier transform of this signal will be a sum of two Dirac delta functions at these frequencies. Mathematically, the Fourier transform F(Ï‰) can be represented as:\n\n$F(\\omega) = \\pi[\\delta(\\omega - 20\\pi) + \\delta(\\omega - 40\\pi)]$\n\nNow, we need to determine the frequencies that will be attenuated during propagation at a distance of 500 meters. The attenuation constant is given as 0.1 Np/km at a frequency of 10 kHz. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the attenuation constant to Np/m:\n\n$\\alpha = 0.1 \\,\\text{Np/km} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{km}}{1000\\,\\text{m}} = 0.0001 \\,\\text{Np/m}$\n\nNext, we calculate the attenuation at the given distance of 500 meters:\n\n$A = \\alpha \\times d = 0.0001 \\,\\text{Np/m} \\times 500\\,\\text{m} = 0.05\\,\\text{Np}$\n\nNow, we need to find the attenuation in dB:\n\n$A_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}(A) = 10 \\log_{10}(0.05) \\approx -13\\,\\text{dB}$\n\nSince the attenuation is frequency-dependent, we need to find the attenuation at both frequencies present in the signal (10 Hz and 20 Hz). We are given the attenuation constant at 10 kHz, so we can assume that the attenuation is proportional to the frequency. Therefore, the attenuation at 10 Hz and 20 Hz can be calculated as:\n\n$A_{10\\,\\text{Hz}} = \\frac{10\\,\\text{Hz}}{10\\,\\text{kHz}} \\times A_{10\\,\\text{kHz}} = \\frac{10}{10^4} \\times 0.05 = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{Np}$\n\n$A_{20\\,\\text{Hz}} = \\frac{20\\,\\text{Hz}}{10\\,\\text{kHz}} \\times A_{10\\,\\text{kHz}} = \\frac{20}{10^4} \\times 0.05 = 10 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{Np}$\n\nNow, we need to compare these attenuation values with the calculated attenuation at 500 meters (0.05 Np). Since both $A_{10\\,\\text{Hz}}$ and $A_{20\\,\\text{Hz}}$ are less than 0.05 Np, neither of the frequencies will be significantly attenuated during propagation at a distance of 500 meters."
