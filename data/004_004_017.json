    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 1 on the interval [0, 2], we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 0 to 2.\n\nâˆ«(x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 1) dx from 0 to 2\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative of x^3 is (1/4)x^4\nAntiderivative of -2x^2 is (-2/3)x^3\nAntiderivative of 3x is (3/2)x^2\nAntiderivative of 1 is x\n\nSo, the antiderivative of the function is (1/4)x^4 - (2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 + x\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval and subtract:\n\n[((1/4)(2)^4 - (2/3)(2)^3 + (3/2)(2)^2 + (2)) - ((1/4)(0)^4 - (2/3)(0)^3 + (3/2)(0)^2 + (0))]\n\n= [(1/4)(16) - (2/3)(8) + (3/2)(4) + 2]\n\n= [4 - (16/3) + 6 + 2]\n\n= [12 - (16/3)]\n\n= [36/3 - 16/3]\n\n= 20/3\n\nSo, the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 1 on the interval [0, 2] is 20/3 square units."
