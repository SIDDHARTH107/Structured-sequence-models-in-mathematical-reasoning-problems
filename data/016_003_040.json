    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot Set is a fractal, which means it has a non-integer, infinite perimeter. The boundary of the Mandelbrot Set is infinitely complex, and as you zoom in, you will continue to find more intricate details. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an exact value for the perimeter of the Mandelbrot Set, even within a specific region."
