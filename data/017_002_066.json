    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we need to find all the divisors of the order of G, which is 10. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. For each divisor, there is at least one subgroup of that order. Let's find these subgroups.\n\n1. Subgroups of order 1:\nThere is only one subgroup of order 1, which is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element. This subgroup is cyclic, as it only contains one element.\n\n2. Subgroups of order 2:\nTo find subgroups of order 2, we need to find elements of G with order 2. The order of an element a^k is given by the formula |G| / gcd(|G|, k), where gcd is the greatest common divisor. In this case, |G| = 10.\n\nWe need to find k such that gcd(10, k) = 5, as 10 / 5 = 2. The possible values of k are 2 and 8, as gcd(10, 2) = gcd(10, 8) = 2. Therefore, the elements of order 2 are a^2 and a^8. The subgroups generated by these elements are {e, a^2} and {e, a^8}. Both of these subgroups are cyclic, as they have order 2.\n\n3. Subgroups of order 5:\nTo find subgroups of order 5, we need to find elements of G with order 5. We need to find k such that gcd(10, k) = 2, as 10 / 2 = 5. The possible values of k are 4 and 6, as gcd(10, 4) = gcd(10, 6) = 2. Therefore, the elements of order 5 are a^4 and a^6. The subgroups generated by these elements are {e, a^4, a^8, a^2, a^6} and {e, a^6, a^2, a^8, a^4}. However, these subgroups are the same, so there is only one distinct subgroup of order 5, which is cyclic.\n\n4. Subgroups of order 10:\nThere is only one subgroup of order 10, which is the entire group G itself, generated by a. This subgroup is cyclic, as G is a cyclic group.\n\nIn conclusion, the subgroups of G are:\n1. {e} (cyclic)\n2. {e, a^2} (cyclic)\n3. {e, a^8} (cyclic)\n4. {e, a^4, a^8, a^2, a^6} (cyclic)\n5.
