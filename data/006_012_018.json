    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, robberies) occurring within a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (robberies) in the given interval (30 days)\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (robberies) per interval\n- k is the number of events (robberies) we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nIn this case, we are given that there are on average 3 robberies per month (30 days) within a 1-mile radius of your home. So, λ = 3.\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least one robbery occurring in the next 30 days. To do this, we can find the probability of zero robberies occurring and subtract that from 1.\n\nUsing the Poisson formula with k = 0:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-3) * 3^0) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-3) * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) ≈ (0.0498 * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.0498\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one robbery occurring:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - 0.0498\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 0.9502\n\nSo, the probability of a robbery occurring within a 1-mile radius of your home in the next 30 days is approximately 95.02%."
