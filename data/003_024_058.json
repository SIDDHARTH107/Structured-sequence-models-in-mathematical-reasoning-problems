    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B using trigonometry, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the angle θ between the two vectors.\n2. Find the magnitude of vector A.\n3. Calculate the projection of A onto B using the formula: projection = |A| * cos(θ)\n\nStep 1: Find the angle θ between the two vectors\nWe can use the dot product formula to find the angle between the two vectors:\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nA · B = (3 * 2) + (4 * 5) = 6 + 20 = 26\n|A| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √(2² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| * |B|)\ncos(θ) = 26 / (5 * √29)\ncos(θ) ≈ 0.9028\n\nStep 2: Find the magnitude of vector A\nWe already found the magnitude of vector A in step 1: |A| = 5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the projection of A onto B\nprojection = |A| * cos(θ)\nprojection = 5 * 0.9028\nprojection ≈ 4.514\n\nThe projection of vector A onto vector B is approximately 4.514 units in the direction of vector B."
