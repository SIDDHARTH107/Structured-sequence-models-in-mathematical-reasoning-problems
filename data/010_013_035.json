    "message_2": "To find the total Chern class of a complex vector bundle $E$, we need to compute the product of the individual Chern classes. The total Chern class is given by $c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + \\cdots$. In this case, we are given the first and second Chern classes, so we can write the total Chern class as:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E)$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given expressions for $c_1(E)$ and $c_2(E)$:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + ([H] + 3[H']) + (2[H]^2 + 3[H][H'] + [H']^2)$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by combining the terms:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + [H] + 3[H'] + 2[H]^2 + 3[H][H'] + [H']^2$$\n\nThis is the total Chern class of the complex vector bundle $E$ over the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^3$."
