    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier transform of the given signal f(t) = 3sin(2πt) + 4cos(4πt), we will use the following formula for the continuous-time Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the entire time domain.\n\nIn our case, the time domain is from 0 to 1. So, we need to calculate the following integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[3sin(2πt) + 4cos(4πt)] * e^(-jωt) dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to 1.\n\nLet's break this integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = 3 ∫[sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt + 4 ∫[cos(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where both integrals are taken from 0 to 1.\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve each integral separately.\n\nFor the first integral, let u = sin(2πt) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = (2πcos(2πt)) dt and v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\n∫[sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt = uv - ∫[v * du] = (-1/jω)sin(2πt)e^(-jωt) - (2π/jω) ∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nFor the second integral in the first part, let u = cos(2πt) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = (-2πsin(2πt)) dt and v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\n∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt = uv - ∫[v * du] = (-1/jω)cos(2πt)e^(-jωt) + (2π/j^2ω^2) ∫[sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into the first part:\n\n3 ∫[sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt = 3[(-1/jω)sin(2πt)e^(-jωt) - (2π/jω) ∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt]\n\nFor the second integral, let u = cos(4πt) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = (-4πsin(4πt)) dt and v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\n4 ∫[cos(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt = 4[(-1/jω)cos(4πt)e^(-jωt) + (4π/j^2ω^2) ∫[sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt]\n\nNow, we can combine the results:\n\nF(ω) = 3[(-1/jω)sin(2πt)e^(-jωt) - (2π/jω) ∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt] + 4[(-1/jω)cos(4πt)e^(-jωt) + (4π/j^2ω^2) ∫[sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt]\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate the integrals at the limits 0 and 1:\n\nF(ω) = 3[(-1/jω)(sin(2π)-sin(0))e^(-jω) - (2π/jω) ∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt] + 4[(-1/jω)(cos(4π)-cos(0))e^(-jω) + (4π/j^2ω^2) ∫[sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt]\n\nSince sin(2π) = sin(0) = 0 and cos(4π) = cos(0) = 1, we get:\n\nF(ω) = 3[0 - (2π/jω) ∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt] + 4[(-1/jω)(1-1)e^(-jω) + (4π/j^2ω^2) ∫[sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt]\n\nF(ω) = - (6π/jω) ∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt + (16π/j^2ω^2) ∫[sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nThe remaining integrals are challenging to evaluate in a closed form, and they may not have a simple closed-form expression. In practice, these integrals would be evaluated numerically or approximated using various techniques depending on the application."
