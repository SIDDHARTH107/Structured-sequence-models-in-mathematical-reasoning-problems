    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of partitioning and generating functions. We want to find the number of ways to partition the number 10 into at most 4 parts, where each part is a positive integer. \n\nLet's represent the partitions as (a, b, c, d), where a, b, c, and d are positive integers. We can have the following cases:\n\n1. One part: (10)\n2. Two parts: (a, b) such that a + b = 10\n3. Three parts: (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 10\n4. Four parts: (a, b, c, d) such that a + b + c + d = 10\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways for each case:\n\n1. One part: There is only 1 way, which is (10).\n\n2. Two parts: We can have the following partitions: (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,5). There are 5 ways.\n\n3. Three parts: We can use the stars and bars method. We have 10 - 3 = 7 stars (subtracting 3 to account for the minimum value of 1 for each part) and 2 bars to divide the stars into 3 groups. The number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is C(9, 2) = 36. However, we need to subtract the cases where one of the parts is greater than 4, as that would result in more than 4 parts when considering the 4 parts case. These cases are (1,1,8), (1,2,7), (1,3,6), (1,4,5), (2,2,6), (2,3,5), and (3,3,4). So, there are 36 - 7 = 29 ways.\n\n4. Four parts: We can use the stars and bars method again. We have 10 - 4 = 6 stars (subtracting 4 to account for the minimum value of 1 for each part) and 3 bars to divide the stars into 4 groups. The number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is C(9, 3) = 84.\n\nAdding up the ways for each case, we get 1 + 5 + 29 + 84 = 119 ways to partition the number 10 into at most 4 parts, where each part is a positive integer."
