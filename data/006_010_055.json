    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of 500 people from a certain demographic group, at least 20 will be affected by a disease if the prevalence of the disease in that group is 5%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (affected individuals) in n trials (total people)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k! * (n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (prevalence of the disease, 5% or 0.05)\n- n is the total number of trials (500 people)\n- k is the number of successes (20 or more affected individuals)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 20 people being affected, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 500.\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19))\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up. After calculating the probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X >= 20) â‰ˆ 1 - 0.0188 = 0.9812\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 people out of 500 will be affected by the disease is approximately 98.12%."
