    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in the given network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we will iteratively find augmenting paths from the source (S) to the sink (T) and update the residual capacities of the edges involved in the path. We will continue this process until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from S to T: S -> A -> D -> T. The minimum capacity along this path is 10 (edge A -> D). We update the residual capacities of the edges involved in this path:\n\n   - S -> A: 10 (20 - 10)\n   - A -> D: 0 (10 - 10)\n   - D -> T: 10 (10 + 10)\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: S -> A -> B -> D -> T. The minimum capacity along this path is 10 (edge S -> A).\n\n   - S -> A: 0 (10 - 10)\n   - A -> B: 0 (10 - 10)\n   - B -> D: 10 (20 - 10)\n   - D -> T: 20 (10 + 10)\n\n3. We find another augmenting path: S -> C -> B -> D -> T. The minimum capacity along this path is 10 (edge S -> C).\n\n   - S -> C: 0 (10 - 10)\n   - C -> B: 0 (10 - 10)\n   - B -> D: 0 (10 - 10)\n   - D -> T: 30 (20 + 10)\n\nAt this point, there are no more augmenting paths from S to T. Therefore, the maximum flow in the network is 30 units."
