    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, which is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\n$H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)$\n\nwhere $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + ax^2y - \\frac{1}{3}by^3$ is the potential energy, and $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are parameters. In this case, $a = b = c = d = 1.0$.\n\nThe maximum Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions and is related to chaos in the system. To calculate the maximum Lyapunov exponent, one would need to numerically integrate the equations of motion for the Hénon-Heiles system and compute the Lyapunov exponents using an algorithm such as the one proposed by Benettin et al. (1980).\n\nHowever, calculating the maximum Lyapunov exponent requires numerical simulations and is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response. It is recommended to use specialized software or programming languages (such as Python with the scipy library) to perform these calculations."
