    "message_1": "What is the probability that in a network of 50 computers, at least 5 computers will be affected by a ransomware attack at the same time, given that the probability of a single computer getting attacked by this cyber threat is 0.03?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, computers affected by ransomware) in n trials (computers in the network)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of computers in the network (50)\n- k is the number of computers affected by ransomware (at least 5)\n- p is the probability of a single computer getting attacked by ransomware (0.03)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a single computer not getting attacked by ransomware (0.97)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 5 computers being affected, we need to calculate the probability of 5, 6, 7, ..., 50 computers being affected and sum them up. Alternatively, we can find the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 computers being affected and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.03)^0 * (0.97)^50\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * (0.03)^1 * (0.97)^49\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * (0.03)^2 * (0.97)^48\nP(X = 3) = C(50, 3) * (0.03)^3 * (0.97)^47\nP(X = 4) = C(50, 4) * (0.03)^4 * (0.97)^46\n\nCalculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.218\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.370\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.296\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.095\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.018\n\nSum the probabilities:\n\nP(X < 5) ≈ 0.218 + 0.370 + 0.296 + 0.095 + 0.018 ≈ 0.997\n\nFinally, subtract the sum from 1:\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - 0.997 ≈ 0.003\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 computers will be affected by a ransomware attack at the same time is approximately 0.3%."
