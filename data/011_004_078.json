    "message_1": "How many ways can you distribute 15 identical candies among three distinct children such that each child receives at least one candy?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars\" in combinatorics. Since each child must receive at least one candy, we can give one candy to each child first. Now we have 12 candies left to distribute among the three children.\n\nWe can represent the 12 candies as 12 stars (⋆) and use 2 bars (|) to separate them into three groups. Each group represents the number of candies a child receives. For example, the arrangement \"⋆⋆⋆|⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆|⋆⋆⋆⋆\" represents giving 3 candies to the first child, 5 candies to the second child, and 4 candies to the third child.\n\nNow the problem becomes finding the number of ways to arrange the 12 stars and 2 bars. There are a total of 14 positions (12 stars + 2 bars), and we need to choose 2 of these positions for the bars. This can be done in C(14, 2) ways, where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nC(14, 2) = 14! / (2! * (14 - 2)!) = 14! / (2! * 12!) = (14 * 13) / (2 * 1) = 91\n\nSo there are 91 ways to distribute 15 identical candies among three distinct children such that each child receives at least one candy."
