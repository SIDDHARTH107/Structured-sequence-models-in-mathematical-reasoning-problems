    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the matrix of variables, and B is the matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  7 |\n    | -2 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (2 * -2) - (3 * 4) = -4 - 12 = -16\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nAdjoint(A) = | -2 -3 |\n                     | -4  2 |\n\nNow, multiply the adjoint of A by the reciprocal of the determinant:\n\nA^(-1) = (-1/16) * | -2 -3 |\n                              | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 1/8   3/16 |\n               | 1/4  -1/8 |\n\nNow, we multiply A^(-1) by B to get the solution matrix X:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | 1/8   3/16 | * |  7 |\n       | 1/4  -1/8 |    | -2 |\n\nX = | (1/8 * 7) + (3/16 * -2) |\n       | (1/4 * 7) + (-1/8 * -2) |\n\nX = | 7/8 - 3/8 |\n       | 7/4 + 1/4 |\n\nX = | 1/2 |\n       | 2   |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1/2 and y = 2."
