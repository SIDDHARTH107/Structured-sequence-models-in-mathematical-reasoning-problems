    "message_1": "Under the non-parametric test, a group of students has taken two sets of math tests before and after attending additional lessons. The scores are as follows:\n\nBefore: 78, 85, 92, 89, 77, 80, 85, 90, 84, 86\nAfter: 87, 90, 92, 88, 82, 86, 88, 91, 90, 89\n\nUse the Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine whether there has been a statistically significant improvement in the students' test scores after attending additional lessons. Set your significance level at 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon signed rank test, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the differences between the before and after scores.\n2. Rank the absolute differences, ignoring any zero differences.\n3. Sum the ranks of the positive differences and the negative differences separately.\n4. Calculate the test statistic W, which is the smaller of the two sums.\n5. Compare W to the critical value for the given sample size and significance level.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the differences.\nDifferences: 9, 5, 0, -1, 5, 6, 3, 1, 6, 3\n\nStep 2: Rank the absolute differences, ignoring any zero differences.\nAbsolute differences: 9, 5, 1, 5, 6, 3, 1, 6, 3\nRanks: 8, 4.5, 1.5, 4.5, 6.5, 3, 1.5, 6.5, 3\n\nStep 3: Sum the ranks of the positive differences and the negative differences separately.\nPositive differences (improvements): 8 + 4.5 + 4.5 + 6.5 + 3 + 1.5 + 6.5 + 3 = 37.5\nNegative differences (declines): 1.5 = 1.5\n\nStep 4: Calculate the test statistic W, which is the smaller of the two sums.\nW = min(37.5, 1.5) = 1.5\n\nStep 5: Compare W to the critical value for the given sample size and significance level.\nFor a sample size of 10 and a significance level of 0.05, the critical value for a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test is 8.\n\nSince our test statistic W (1.5) is less than the critical value (8), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there has been a statistically significant improvement in the students' test scores after attending additional lessons at the 0.05 significance level."
