    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest game with 5 players. Each player selects a number between 0 and 100, and the winning number is the one closest to two-thirds of the average of all the numbers chosen. If two or more players choose the same winning number, the prize is divided equally among them.\n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for each player to maximize their chances of winning in this beauty contest game?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for each player in this beauty contest game, we can use the concept of iterated elimination of dominated strategies.\n\n1. In the first round, assume that all players choose numbers uniformly between 0 and 100. The average of these numbers would be 50, and two-thirds of that average would be 33.33. Therefore, no rational player would choose a number greater than 33.33, as it could never be the winning number.\n\n2. In the second round, we can now assume that all players choose numbers uniformly between 0 and 33.33. The average of these numbers would be 16.67, and two-thirds of that average would be 11.11. Therefore, no rational player would choose a number greater than 11.11 in this round.\n\n3. In the third round, we can assume that all players choose numbers uniformly between 0 and 11.11. The average of these numbers would be 5.56, and two-thirds of that average would be 3.70. Therefore, no rational player would choose a number greater than 3.70 in this round.\n\n4. Continuing this process, we can see that the range of possible numbers chosen by rational players keeps shrinking. In the limit, as the number of rounds goes to infinity, the range of possible numbers approaches 0.\n\nIn this iterated elimination of dominated strategies, the optimal strategy for each player is to choose a number close to 0. However, since there are 5 players, each player should choose a slightly different number close to 0 to maximize their chances of winning without having to share the prize. For example, one player could choose 0, another could choose 0.1, another could choose 0.2, and so on. This way, they all have a high chance of being close to the winning number without having to split the prize."
