    "message_2": "To find the homotopy class of the continuous function $f:S^1_1 \\to S^1_2$, we need to determine the winding number of the function around the circle $S^1_2$. The winding number is an integer that represents the number of times the function wraps around the circle.\n\nLet's parameterize the circle $S^1_1$ using the angle $\\theta$ as follows:\n\n$$S^1_1(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the function $f(\\theta)$ that maps $S^1_1(\\theta)$ to $S^1_2$. Since $f(1,0) = (3/2,0)$, we can write the function $f(\\theta)$ as:\n\n$$f(\\theta) = (2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the winding number of $f(\\theta)$ around the circle $S^1_2$. The winding number can be calculated as the total change in angle as $\\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$ divided by $2\\pi$. To find the total change in angle, we can compute the derivative of the angle with respect to $\\theta$ and integrate it over the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nThe angle of $f(\\theta)$ with respect to the center of $S^1_2$ is given by:\n\n$$\\phi(\\theta) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta - 1}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we compute the derivative of $\\phi(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\theta(2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta - 1) - \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta}{(2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta - 1)^2 + \\sin^2\\theta}$$\n\nIntegrating this expression over the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$ gives the total change in angle:\n\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} d\\theta$$\n\nComputing this integral, we get:\n\n$$\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi$$\n\nFinally, we divide the total change in angle by $2\\pi$ to obtain the winding number:\n\n$$\\text{Winding number} = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi} = 1$$\n\nThus, the homotopy class of the continuous function $f:S^1_1 \\to S^1_2$ is represented by the generator element $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$."
