    "message_1": "A stream cipher generates a pseudorandom keystream using a secret key and encrypts the plaintext by XORing it with the keystream. Suppose you have a secret key of length 64 bits and you generate a keystream of length 1024 bits. What is the maximum number of unique plaintext messages that can be encrypted using this keystream before the keystream repeats itself?",
    "message_2": "The maximum number of unique plaintext messages that can be encrypted using this keystream before the keystream repeats itself is determined by the number of possible secret keys. Since the secret key is 64 bits long, there are 2^64 possible secret keys. Therefore, the maximum number of unique plaintext messages that can be encrypted using this keystream before the keystream repeats itself is 2^64."
