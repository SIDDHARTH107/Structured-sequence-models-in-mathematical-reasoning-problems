    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(32), we need to find the prime factors of 32 and look for pairs of the same factor.\n\n32 can be factored as 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 (five 2's).\n\nNow, group the factors in pairs: (2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × 2\n\nEach pair of the same factor can be simplified as the factor itself: 2 × 2 × √2\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n4√2"
