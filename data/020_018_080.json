In each round of the game, both players simultaneously choose to either flip their penny to heads (H) or to tails (T). If both players choose the same outcome, then Tom wins and receives 1 point. If both players choose different outcomes, then Jerry wins and receives 1 point. The players have played the game 10 times already and the points are tied at 5-5. \n\nTom thinks Jerry is likely to choose H in the next round, while Jerry thinks Tom is likely to choose T in the next round.\n\nWhat choice should Tom make in the next round to maximize his chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "Since Tom thinks Jerry is likely to choose H in the next round, Tom should also choose H to maximize his chances of winning. If both players choose H, Tom will win and receive 1 point."
