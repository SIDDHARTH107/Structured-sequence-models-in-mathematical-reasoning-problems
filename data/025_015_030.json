    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (-1,1,2), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the vector of partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - 4xyz.\n\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 4x^3 - 4yz\n∂F/∂y = 4y^3 - 4xz\n∂F/∂z = 4z^3 - 4xy\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (-1,1,2):\n\n∂F/∂x(-1,1,2) = 4(-1)^3 - 4(1)(2) = -4 - 8 = -12\n∂F/∂y(-1,1,2) = 4(1)^3 - 4(-1)(2) = 4 + 8 = 12\n∂F/∂z(-1,1,2) = 4(2)^3 - 4(-1)(1) = 32 + 4 = 36\n\nThe gradient of F at the point (-1,1,2) is given by the vector <-12, 12, 36>.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point (-1,1,2) and (A, B, C) is the gradient <-12, 12, 36>.\n\n-12(x - (-1)) + 12(y - 1) + 36(z - 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-12x - 12 + 12y - 12 + 36z - 72 = 0\n\nCombining the constants:\n\n-12x + 12y + 36z - 96 = 0\n\nDivide by -12 to simplify further:\n\nx - y - 3z + 8 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (-1,1,2) is:\n\nx - y - 3z + 8 = 0"
