    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial or use synthetic division to find the roots.\n\nLet's try factoring by grouping:\n\nx^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0\n\nGroup the terms:\n(x^3 - 6x^2) + (11x - 6) = 0\n\nFactor out the common factors:\nx^2(x - 6) + 1(11x - 6) = 0\n\nNow we can see that both terms have a common binomial factor of (x - 6):\nx^2(x - 6) - 1(x - 6) = 0\n\nFactor out the common binomial factor:\n(x - 6)(x^2 - 1) = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic factor (x^2 - 1) which can be factored further:\n(x - 6)(x - 1)(x + 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the roots by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 6 = 0 => x = 6\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\nx + 1 = 0 => x = -1\n\nSo, the possible solutions for 'x' are 6, 1, and -1."
