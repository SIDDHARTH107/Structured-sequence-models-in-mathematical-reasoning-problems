If the first three coefficients are $a_0 = 0$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_2 = 0$, find the coefficient $a_3$ and the radius of convergence of the Taylor series.",
    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is analytic on the unit disk $D$, its Taylor series converges to $f(z)$ for all $z \\in D$. We are given that $a_0 = 0$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_2 = 0$. So, the function $f(z)$ can be written as:\n\n$$f(z) = z + \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}a_nz^n$$\n\nNow, we can find the coefficient $a_3$ by differentiating $f(z)$ twice and evaluating at $z = 0$. \n\nFirst, differentiate $f(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$$f'(z) = 1 + \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}na_nz^{n-1}$$\n\nNow, differentiate $f'(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$$f''(z) = \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}n(n-1)a_nz^{n-2}$$\n\nEvaluate $f''(0)$:\n\n$$f''(0) = 3(3-1)a_3(0)^{3-2} = 6a_3$$\n\nSince $f''(0) = 6a_3$, we have:\n\n$$a_3 = \\frac{f''(0)}{6}$$\n\nTo find the radius of convergence, we can use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence $R$ is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{R} = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n|^{\\frac{1}{n}}$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is analytic on the unit disk $D$, the radius of convergence must be at least 1. We can't determine the exact value of the radius of convergence without more information about the coefficients $a_n$ for $n \\geq 4$. However, we know that the radius of convergence is at least 1.\n\nIn summary, the coefficient $a_3$ is given by $\\frac{f''(0)}{6}$, and the radius of convergence is at least 1."
