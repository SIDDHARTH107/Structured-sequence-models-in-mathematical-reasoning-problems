    "message_2": "To find the intersection number of the two curves at the point (1,1), we first need to verify that the point (1,1) lies on both curves.\n\nFor the first curve, y = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1:\ny(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 2(1) + 1 = 1 - 3 + 2 + 1 = 1\n\nFor the second curve, y = x^3 - 3x^2 - x - 1:\ny(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1)^2 - (1) - 1 = 1 - 3 - 1 - 1 = 1\n\nSince (1,1) lies on both curves, we can proceed to find the intersection number.\n\nThe intersection number is the number of times the two curves intersect at the given point. To find this, we can compute the difference between the two curve equations:\n\ny1 - y2 = (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^3 - 3x^2 - x - 1)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\ny1 - y2 = 3x\n\nNow, we can find the intersection number by solving for x:\n\n3x = 0\nx = 0\n\nHowever, this solution does not correspond to the point (1,1). Since there is no other intersection point, the intersection number of the two curves at the point (1,1) is 0."
