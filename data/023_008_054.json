    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients for the non-periodic function f(x) = x^2 for -1 ≤ x ≤ 3, we first need to make the function periodic. We can do this by extending the function to a periodic function g(x) with period L = 4 (since the interval is of length 4). Now, g(x) = x^2 for -1 ≤ x ≤ 3 and g(x + 4n) = g(x) for any integer n.\n\nThe Fourier series for a periodic function g(x) with period L is given by:\n\ng(x) = Σ [a_n * cos(2πnx/L) + b_n * sin(2πnx/L)]\n\nwhere the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[g(x) * cos(2πnx/L) dx] from x = -L/2 to L/2, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[g(x) * sin(2πnx/L) dx] from x = -L/2 to L/2, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor our function g(x), L = 4, so we have:\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * cos(πnx/2) dx] from x = -1 to 3\n\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * sin(πnx/2) dx] from x = -1 to 3\n\nNow, we can compute the coefficients a_n and b_n for n = 0, 1, 2, and 3:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 dx] from x = -1 to 3 = (1/2) * [(3^3)/3 - (-1)^3/3] = (1/2) * (26/3) = 13/3\n\na_1 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * cos(πx/2) dx] from x = -1 to 3\na_2 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * cos(πx) dx] from x = -1 to 3\na_3 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * cos(3πx/2) dx] from x = -1 to 3\n\nb_1 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * sin(πx/2) dx] from x = -1 to 3\nb_2 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * sin(πx) dx] from x = -1 to 3\nb_3 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * sin(3πx/2) dx] from x = -1 to 3\n\nTo find a_n for n > 0 and b_n, we need to integrate by parts or use a symbolic computation tool like Wolfram Alpha or Mathematica. The results are:\n\na_1 = -8/π^2\na_2 = 0\na_3 = 8/(9π^2)\n\nb_1 = -16/π^3\nb_2 = 0\nb_3 = 16/(9π^3)\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients c_n are:\n\nc_0 = a_0 = 13/3\nc_1 = a_1 + b_1 = -8/π^2 - 16/π^3\nc_2 = a_2 + b_2 = 0\nc_3 = a_3 + b_3 = 8/(9π^2) + 16/(9π^3)"
