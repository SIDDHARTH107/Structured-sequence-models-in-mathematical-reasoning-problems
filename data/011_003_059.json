    "message_1": "A manufacturer has 8 different models of cars and wants to offer a discount on any combination of models that a customer buys at once. How many different combinations of models can a customer choose from? (Hint: Use Pascal's triangle to find the answer)",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different combinations of models a customer can choose from, we can use the concept of combinations from combinatorics. The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items is given by the binomial coefficient, which can be found using Pascal's triangle.\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (the number of different car models), and k can be any number from 0 to 8 (since a customer can choose any number of models, including none).\n\nUsing Pascal's triangle, we find the coefficients for the 9th row (remember that Pascal's triangle starts with row 0):\n\n1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1\n\nThese coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k items from a set of 8 items, where k ranges from 0 to 8.\n\nNow, we sum up these coefficients to find the total number of combinations:\n\n1 + 8 + 28 + 56 + 70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 different combinations of models a customer can choose from."
