    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos(2x) = sqrt(2)sin(x) in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, we can begin by using the double angle formula for cosine:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x)\n\nNow, substitute this into the original equation:\n\n2(1 - 2sin^2(x)) = sqrt(2)sin(x)\n\nExpand and rearrange the equation:\n\n4sin^2(x) - sqrt(2)sin(x) + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in sin(x). Let's make a substitution to make it easier to solve:\n\nLet y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n4y^2 - sqrt(2)y + 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = -sqrt(2), and c = 2:\n\ny = (sqrt(2) ± sqrt((-sqrt(2))^2 - 4 * 4 * 2)) / (2 * 4)\n\ny = (sqrt(2) ± sqrt(2 - 32)) / 8\n\nSince the value inside the square root is negative (2 - 32 = -30), there are no real solutions for y, which means there are no real solutions for sin(x) in this equation.\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions for the equation 2cos(2x) = sqrt(2)sin(x) in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π."
