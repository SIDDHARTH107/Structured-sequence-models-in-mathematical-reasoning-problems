    "message_2": "To find the rank and torsion subgroup of the Abelian variety $A = E \\times E$, we first need to analyze the elliptic curve $E$ given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 7x + 6$.\n\nFirst, we find the discriminant of the curve to ensure it is non-singular. The discriminant of an elliptic curve given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ is $\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$. In our case, $A = -7$ and $B = 6$, so the discriminant is:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4(-7)^3 + 27(6)^2) = -16(-1372) = 21952$\n\nSince $\\Delta \\neq 0$, the curve is non-singular.\n\nNext, we find the torsion points on the curve. Torsion points are the points on the elliptic curve that have finite order. We can use Nagell-Lutz theorem to find the torsion points. According to the Nagell-Lutz theorem, if $(x, y)$ is a torsion point with integer coordinates, then either $y = 0$ or $y^2$ divides the discriminant $\\Delta$.\n\n1. If $y = 0$, we have $x^3 - 7x + 6 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(x - 1)(x^2 + x - 6) = 0$. The integer solutions are $x = 1$ and $x = -2$. Thus, we have two torsion points: $(1, 0)$ and $(-2, 0)$.\n\n2. If $y^2$ divides $\\Delta$, we have $y^2 | 21952$. The divisors of $21952$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 1373, 2746, 5492, 10984, 21952$. We can check each divisor to see if it corresponds to a valid point on the curve.\n\nAfter checking, we find that there are no additional torsion points with integer coordinates. Therefore, the torsion subgroup of $E$ is generated by the two points $(1, 0)$ and $(-2, 0)$, and is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we consider the Abelian variety $A = E \\times E$. The torsion subgroup of $A$ is the product of the torsion subgroups of each factor, so the torsion subgroup of $A$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nAs for the rank of $A$, it is equal to the sum of the ranks of each factor. Since we do not have enough information to determine the rank of $E$, we cannot determine the rank of $A$. However, if we were given the rank of $E$, say $r_E$, then the rank of $A$ would be $2r_E$."
