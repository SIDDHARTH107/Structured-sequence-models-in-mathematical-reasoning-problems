    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 5, we need to find the first derivative of the function and set it equal to zero.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nNow, we set the first derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first try to factor it:\n\n(3x - 12)(x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x - 12 = 0\nx = 4\n\nx - 2 = 0\nx = 2\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 5 are x = 2 and x = 4."
