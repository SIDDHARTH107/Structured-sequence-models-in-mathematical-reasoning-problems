    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company in a given year is 0.05. If there are 20 companies in a region, what is the probability that at least one of them will experience this type of fraud in a year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability approach. Instead of finding the probability of at least one company experiencing fraud, we will find the probability of none of the companies experiencing fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a company not experiencing fraud in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 20 companies, the probability of none of them experiencing fraud is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, we find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one company experiencing fraud:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 20 companies will experience financial fraud in a year is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
