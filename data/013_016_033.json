    "message_1": "Suppose two individuals, A and B, are offered the same job that pays a salary of $100,000. Each individual has a choice between a high-effort or a low-effort level of work. If both individuals choose the high-effort level, the total output is $200,000. If both individuals choose the low-effort level, the total output is $150,000. If one individual chooses the high-effort level while the other chooses the low-effort level, the total output is $175,000. However, the effort level of each individual is unobservable by the employer, and there is a chance of 0.5 for any individual to be \"lazy\" and choose the low-effort level regardless of the other's choice. Given this situation, what is the optimal strategy for each individual and what is the expected output?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for each individual, we need to analyze the expected output for each possible combination of choices. There are four possible scenarios:\n\n1. Both A and B choose high-effort level.\n2. A chooses high-effort level, and B chooses low-effort level.\n3. A chooses low-effort level, and B chooses high-effort level.\n4. Both A and B choose low-effort level.\n\nLet's calculate the expected output for each scenario:\n\n1. Both A and B choose high-effort level:\n   Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n   Output: $200,000\n   Expected output: 0.25 * $200,000 = $50,000\n\n2. A chooses high-effort level, and B chooses low-effort level:\n   Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n   Output: $175,000\n   Expected output: 0.25 * $175,000 = $43,750\n\n3. A chooses low-effort level, and B chooses high-effort level:\n   Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n   Output: $175,000\n   Expected output: 0.25 * $175,000 = $43,750\n\n4. Both A and B choose low-effort level:\n   Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n   Output: $150,000\n   Expected output: 0.25 * $150,000 = $37,500\n\nNow, let's sum up the expected output for all scenarios:\nTotal expected output = $50,000 + $43,750 + $43,750 + $37,500 = $175,000\n\nThe optimal strategy for each individual is to choose the high-effort level, as this leads to the highest expected output. However, due to the 0.5 probability of being \"lazy\" and choosing the low-effort level, the expected output for the employer is $175,000."
