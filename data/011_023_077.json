    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph G, we can use the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nSince G has 8 vertices and 15 edges, we can first find the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph. The maximum degree of a vertex in a simple graph with n vertices is n - 1. In this case, n = 8, so the maximum degree is 7.\n\nAccording to Brooks' theorem, for any connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph. Since G has 15 edges and 8 vertices, it cannot be a complete graph (which would have 8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 28 edges) or an odd cycle (which would have an odd number of vertices).\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of G is at most 7. However, we need to find the minimum number of colors needed. To do this, we can use the fact that the chromatic number is also the smallest integer k such that G can be k-colored.\n\nWe can start by trying to color the graph with fewer colors. If we can find a valid coloring with fewer colors, then the chromatic number is less than 7.\n\n1. If we try to color the graph with 1 color, we will have adjacent vertices with the same color, so this is not possible.\n2. If we try to color the graph with 2 colors, we will also have adjacent vertices with the same color since the maximum degree is 7, which means there is a vertex connected to 7 other vertices, and we cannot color all of them with only 2 colors.\n\nNow let's try 3 colors. If we can find a valid 3-coloring, then the chromatic number is 3. If not, we can try 4 colors, and so on. However, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact chromatic number.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph G is at least 3 and at most 7. To find the exact chromatic number, more information about the graph's structure is needed."
