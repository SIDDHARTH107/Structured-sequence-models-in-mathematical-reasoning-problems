    "message_1": "Here is an example problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA candy company claims that their bags of M&Ms contain an average of 55 pieces per bag. A sample of 30 bags were randomly selected and the number of M&Ms in each bag was recorded. The sample mean was found to be 57 pieces per bag with a sample standard deviation of 4 pieces. Is there enough evidence to suggest that the company's claim is not true at a 5% level of significance?\n\nThe math student would need to use statistical inference techniques to determine if the sample provides enough evidence to reject the company's claim that the bags contain an average of 55 pieces per bag. The student would calculate a t-test statistic and compare it to the critical value at the 5% significance level to make their conclusion.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean number of M&Ms per bag is 55, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean is not 55.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the t-test statistic.\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\nt = (57 - 55) / (4 / sqrt(30))\nt = 2 / (4 / sqrt(30))\nt ≈ 2 / 0.7303\nt ≈ 2.7386\n\nStep 2: Determine the critical value.\nSince we are testing at a 5% level of significance, we will use a two-tailed test with α/2 = 0.025 in each tail. With 29 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1), we can find the critical value using a t-distribution table or calculator. The critical value for a two-tailed test with 29 degrees of freedom and α/2 = 0.025 is approximately ±2.045.\n\nStep 3: Compare the t-test statistic to the critical value.\nOur calculated t-test statistic (2.7386) is greater than the critical value (2.045). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is enough evidence at a 5% level of significance to suggest that the company's claim of an average of 55 pieces per bag is not true. The sample data indicates that the true mean number of M&Ms per bag is likely different from 55."
