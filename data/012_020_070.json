    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of the graph G, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that preserve adjacency. Let's label the vertices as follows:\n\n```\n        1\n       / \\\n      2   3\n     /     \\\n    4-------5\n```\n\nNow let's find the automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself:\n   (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)\n\n2. The automorphism that swaps vertices 2 and 3, and also swaps vertices 4 and 5:\n   (2 3)(4 5)\n\n3. The automorphism that rotates the graph 120 degrees clockwise:\n   (1 2 3)(4 5)\n\n4. The automorphism that rotates the graph 120 degrees counterclockwise:\n   (1 3 2)(4 5)\n\n5. The automorphism that reflects the graph along the vertical axis through vertex 1:\n   (2 3)(4 5)\n\n6. The automorphism that reflects the graph along the horizontal axis through vertex 4 and 5:\n   (1)(2 3)(4 5)\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of the graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is:\n\n{ (1)(2)(3)(4)(5), (2 3)(4 5), (1 2 3)(4 5), (1 3 2)(4 5), (2 3)(4 5), (1)(2 3)(4 5) }"
