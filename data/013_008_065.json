Each player receives a benefit equal to b = 2x + 1. Find the Nash equilibrium contribution for each player in this game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to determine the contribution level at which no player has an incentive to change their contribution, given the contributions of the other players.\n\nLet xi be the contribution of player i, and let x-i be the sum of contributions of all other players. The total contribution is x = xi + x-i. The total amount in the pool is T = 10x = 10(xi + x-i), and the benefit for player i is b = 2xi + 1.\n\nPlayer i's payoff is the benefit minus the cost of their contribution: Payoff_i = b - xi = (2xi + 1) - xi = xi + 1.\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find the contribution level xi that maximizes player i's payoff, given the contributions of the other players (x-i).\n\nTaking the derivative of the payoff function with respect to xi, we get:\n\nd(Payoff_i)/dxi = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nSince the derivative is 0, the payoff function is maximized when xi = 0. This means that in the Nash equilibrium, each player contributes nothing to the common pool (xi = 0 for all players).\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium contribution for each player in this game is 0."
