    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is an odd function (f(-t) = -f(t)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of a function f(t) is:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ(a_n * cos(nωt) + b_n * sin(nωt))\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, T is the period of the function, and a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients given by:\n\na_0 = (1/T) * ∫(f(t) * 1) dt over one period\na_n = (2/T) * ∫(f(t) * cos(nωt)) dt over one period\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫(f(t) * sin(nωt)) dt over one period\n\nFor the given function, the period T = 2π, so ω = 2π/(2π) = 1.\n\nSince f(t) is an odd function, a_n = 0 for all n. Now, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫(f(t) * sin(nωt)) dt over one period\n\nSince the function has different definitions for different intervals, we need to split the integral:\n\nb_n = (2/2π) * [∫(1 * sin(nt)) dt from -π to 0 + ∫(-1 * sin(nt)) dt from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(sin(nt)) dt from -π to 0 - ∫(sin(nt)) dt from 0 to π]\n\nNow, integrate:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(nt)/n | from -π to 0 + cos(nt)/n | from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(cos(nπ)/n - cos(0)/n) - (cos(nπ)/n - cos(0)/n)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [2(-1)^n/n]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the function f(t):\n\nf(t) = Σ[(2(-1)^n/n) * sin(nt)/π] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nThe first three nonzero terms of the series are:\n\nf(t) ≈ (2sin(t) - sin(3t)/3 + 2sin(5t)/5)/π\n\nTo graph the function and its Fourier series, you can use graphing software like Desmos or WolframAlpha. The original function will be a square wave with amplitude 1 and -1, and the Fourier series will be an approximation of that square wave using sine functions. As you add more terms to the series, the approximation will become more accurate."
