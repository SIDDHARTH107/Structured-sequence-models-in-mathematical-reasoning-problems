    "message_2": "To find the missing side length of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, we have one side with a length of 5 cm and another side with a length of 12 cm. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\nc² = 5² + 12²\nc² = 25 + 144\nc² = 169\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 169 to get the length of the third side:\n\nc = √169\nc = 13\n\nSo, the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) is 13 cm."
