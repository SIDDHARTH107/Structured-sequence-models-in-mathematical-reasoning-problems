    "message_1": "Suppose you have $100,000 to invest in a portfolio consisting of two securities: Stock A and Stock B, with returns represented by random variables X and Y respectively. The following table displays the expected returns and standard deviations for each stock:\n\n| Stock | Expected Return | Standard Deviation |\n|-------|----------------|-------------------|\n| A     | 0.08           | 0.15              |\n| B     | 0.12           | 0.20              |\n\nAssuming that the covariance between the two stocks is 0.025, what is the allocation of investment between the two stocks that will minimize the portfolio's overall risk (as measured by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns)?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the portfolio's overall risk, we need to find the optimal weights for Stock A and Stock B. Let w_A be the weight of Stock A and w_B be the weight of Stock B in the portfolio. Since we are investing the entire amount, w_A + w_B = 1.\n\nThe portfolio's variance (σ_P^2) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσ_P^2 = (w_A * σ_A)^2 + (w_B * σ_B)^2 + 2 * w_A * w_B * Cov(X, Y)\n\nwhere σ_A and σ_B are the standard deviations of Stock A and Stock B, and Cov(X, Y) is the covariance between the two stocks.\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nσ_P^2 = (w_A * 0.15)^2 + ((1 - w_A) * 0.20)^2 + 2 * w_A * (1 - w_A) * 0.025\n\nTo minimize the portfolio's risk, we need to minimize σ_P^2 with respect to w_A. To do this, we can take the derivative of σ_P^2 with respect to w_A and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(σ_P^2) / dw_A = 0\n\nSolve for w_A:\n\n0 = 2 * (0.15^2) * w_A - 2 * (0.20^2) * w_A + 2 * 0.025\n\n0 = 0.045 * w_A - 0.08 * w_A + 0.025\n\n0.035 * w_A = 0.025\n\nw_A = 0.025 / 0.035\nw_A ≈ 0.7143\n\nNow, we can find w_B:\n\nw_B = 1 - w_A\nw_B = 1 - 0.7143\nw_B ≈ 0.2857\n\nSo, the optimal allocation to minimize the portfolio's overall risk is approximately 71.43% in Stock A and 28.57% in Stock B. In terms of the investment amount, this would be $71,430 in Stock A and $28,570 in Stock B."
