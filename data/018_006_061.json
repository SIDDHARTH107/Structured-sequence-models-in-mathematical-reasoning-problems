    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set and A be a subset of U. If U contains 50 elements and A contains 30 elements, how many elements are in the complement of A? Using this information, prove that A union its complement is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "Let A' be the complement of A. Since A is a subset of U and contains 30 elements, there are 50 - 30 = 20 elements in A' (the complement of A).\n\nNow, let's prove that A union A' is equal to U.\n\nBy definition, the union of two sets A and B (denoted as A ∪ B) is the set of all elements that are either in A or in B or in both. In this case, we want to show that A ∪ A' = U.\n\nSince A is a subset of U, all elements in A are also in U. Similarly, since A' is the complement of A and also a subset of U, all elements in A' are also in U. Therefore, every element in A ∪ A' must be in U.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element x in U. Since U is the universal set, x must either be in A or not in A. If x is in A, then x is in A ∪ A' by definition of the union. If x is not in A, then x is in A' (the complement of A), and again, x is in A ∪ A' by definition of the union. In either case, x is in A ∪ A'.\n\nSince every element in A ∪ A' is in U, and every element in U is in A ∪ A', we can conclude that A ∪ A' = U."
