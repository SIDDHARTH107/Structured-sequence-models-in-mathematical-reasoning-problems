    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the volume of a cylinder and then apply the concept of related rates.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this problem, the radius r is constant (4 feet), but the height h is changing as the tank fills with water. We are given the rate at which the volume is increasing (dV/dt = 5 cubic feet per minute) and asked to find the rate at which the height is increasing (dh/dt) when the water is 6 feet deep.\n\nFirst, let's differentiate the volume formula with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = d(πr^2h)/dt\nSince r is constant, we can treat it as a constant in the differentiation:\ndV/dt = πr^2(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dh/dt:\n\n5 = π(4^2)(dh/dt)\n5 = 16π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 16π to isolate dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = 5/(16π)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of π (approximately 3.14) and calculate the value of dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt ≈ 5/(16 * 3.14)\ndh/dt ≈ 0.0997\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the water level is rising at a rate of approximately 0.10 feet per minute when the water is 6 feet deep."
