    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the angle of elevation as A, the height of the building as h, and the distance from the observer to the building as d.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nA = 45 degrees\nh = height of the building (which we want to find)\nd = 30 meters\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(A) = h/d\n\nFirst, we need to find the tangent of the angle A (45 degrees). Since we are working with degrees, make sure your calculator is in degree mode.\n\ntan(45) = 1\n\nNow, we can plug this value into our equation:\n\n1 = h/30\n\nTo find the height of the building, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30:\n\nh = 1 * 30\nh = 30 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is 30 meters."
