    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent. The maximum independent set is the largest possible independent set in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, we can find the maximum independent set by selecting the following vertices: A, D, and G. No two of these vertices are adjacent, and we cannot add any more vertices to the set without violating the independence condition.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is 3."
