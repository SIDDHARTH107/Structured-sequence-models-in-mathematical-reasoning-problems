    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the general solution of the homogeneous equation. The given equation is a linear, constant-coefficient, homogeneous differential equation. The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4r + 13 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots of the characteristic equation:\n\nr = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4*13)) / 2 = -2 ± 3i\n\nSince the roots are complex, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is:\n\ny(x) = e^(-2x) (A*cos(3x) + B*sin(3x))\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions to find the constants A and B.\n\n1) y(0) = 6:\n6 = e^(0) (A*cos(0) + B*sin(0))\n6 = A\nSo, A = 6.\n\n2) y'(0) = -3:\nTo find y'(x), we need to differentiate y(x) with respect to x:\n\ny'(x) = -2e^(-2x) (6*cos(3x) + B*sin(3x)) + e^(-2x) (-6*3*sin(3x) + 3B*cos(3x))\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition y'(0) = -3:\n\n-3 = -2e^(0) (6*cos(0) + B*sin(0)) + e^(0) (-6*3*sin(0) + 3B*cos(0))\n-3 = -12 + 3B\nB = 3\n\nSo, the solution of the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = e^(-2x) (6*cos(3x) + 3*sin(3x))\n\nNow, we can find the solution y(x) at x = 2:\n\ny(2) = e^(-4) (6*cos(6) + 3*sin(6))\n\ny(2) ≈ 0.0183\n\nThus, the solution y(x) at x = 2 is approximately 0.0183."
