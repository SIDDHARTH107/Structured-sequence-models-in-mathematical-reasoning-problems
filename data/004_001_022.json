    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 9, we will apply the power rule for derivatives. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, for f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 9, we will find the derivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the first term, 4x^3:\nUsing the power rule, the derivative is (3)(4)x^(3-1) = 12x^2.\n\nFor the second term, -2x^2:\nUsing the power rule, the derivative is (2)(-2)x^(2-1) = -4x.\n\nFor the third term, 5x:\nUsing the power rule, the derivative is (1)(5)x^(1-1) = 5.\n\nFor the fourth term, -9:\nSince this term is a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 4x + 5"
