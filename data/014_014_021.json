    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MEET ME AT THE PARK\" using the Playfair cipher and the key phrase \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid using the key phrase, removing duplicate letters and filling in the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (omitting \"J\" since it's combined with \"I\" in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   C R Y P T\n   O G A H B\n   D E F I K\n   L M N S U\n   V W X Z Q\n\n2. Break the plaintext message into digraphs (pairs of letters), inserting an \"X\" if there are two identical letters in a row or if there's an odd number of letters in the message:\n\n   ME ET ME AT TH EP AR KX\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the opposite corners of the rectangle (in the same row as the original letter).\n\n4. Encrypt the digraphs:\n\n   ME -> FU\n   ET -> ZG\n   ME -> FU\n   AT -> CV\n   TH -> YD\n   EP -> HR\n   AR -> DB\n   KX -> YF\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the encrypted message:\n\n   FUFUZGFUCVYDHRDBYF"
