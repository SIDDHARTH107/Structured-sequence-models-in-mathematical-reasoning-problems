The company wants to determine the optimal way to transport goods from factories to warehouses while minimizing transportation costs. The transportation costs (in thousands of dollars) from each factory to each warehouse are given in the following table:\n\n\\begin{matrix} &W1 &W2 &W3 &W4 &W5\\\\ F1 &5 &3 &7 &6 &5\\\\ F2 &8 &6 &9 &5 &7\\\\ F3 &3 &5 &6 &8 &6\\\\ F4 &7 &9 &4 &7 &8 \\end{matrix}\n\nWhat is the minimum total transportation cost for the company, and what is the corresponding transportation plan (i.e., how many units of goods should be transported from each factory to each warehouse)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Hungarian Algorithm. The algorithm is used to find the minimum cost of assigning tasks (in this case, transporting goods) to workers (factories) in such a way that each task is assigned to one worker.\n\nStep 1: Subtract the smallest value in each row from all the values in that row.\n\n\\begin{matrix} &W1 &W2 &W3 &W4 &W5\\\\ F1 &2 &0 &4 &3 &2\\\\ F2 &3 &1 &4 &0 &2\\\\ F3 &0 &2 &3 &5 &3\\\\ F4 &3 &5 &0 &3 &4 \\end{matrix}\n\nStep 2: Subtract the smallest value in each column from all the values in that column.\n\n\\begin{matrix} &W1 &W2 &W3 &W4 &W5\\\\ F1 &2 &0 &4 &3 &0\\\\ F2 &3 &1 &4 &0 &2\\\\ F3 &0 &2 &3 &5 &1\\\\ F4 &3 &5 &0 &3 &4 \\end{matrix}\n\nStep 3: Cover all the zeros in the matrix using the minimum number of lines (rows and columns).\n\nIn this case, we can cover all the zeros using 3 lines: one line for row F1, one line for column W2, and one line for column W5.\n\nStep 4: Since the number of lines (3) is not equal to the number of rows (4), we need to modify the matrix further. Find the smallest uncovered value (1) and subtract it from all uncovered values, and add it to the values at the intersection of the lines.\n\n\\begin{matrix} &W1 &W2 &W3 &W4 &W5\\\\ F1 &1 &0 &3 &2 &0\\\\ F2 &2 &1 &3 &0 &1\\\\ F3 &0 &1 &2 &4 &0\\\\ F4 &2 &4 &0 &2 &3 \\end{matrix}\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the number of lines equals the number of rows.\n\nNow, we can cover all the zeros using 4 lines: one line for row F1, one line for row F3, one line for column W2, and one line for column W4. Since the number of lines (4) equals the number of rows (4), we can proceed to the next step.\n\nStep 6: Find the optimal assignment that covers all tasks (transporting goods) with the minimum cost.\n\nF1 -> W2: 0\nF2 -> W4: 0\nF3 -> W1: 0\nF4 -> W3: 0\n\nThe minimum total transportation cost is 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 (in thousands of dollars).\n\nThe corresponding transportation plan is as follows:\n- Transport goods from Factory 1 to Warehouse 2.\n- Transport goods from Factory 2 to Warehouse 4.\n- Transport goods from Factory 3 to Warehouse 1.\n- Transport goods from Factory 4 to Warehouse 3."
