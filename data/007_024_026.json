    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm of 3 with respect to the base 5 modulo 11, we are looking for an integer x such that:\n\n5^x ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n\nWe can start by testing different values of x:\n\nx = 1: 5^1 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\nx = 2: 5^2 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n\nSo, the discrete logarithm of 3 with respect to the base 5 modulo 11 is x = 2."
