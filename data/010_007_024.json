    "message_2": "To determine the fundamental group of the torus, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, we need to decompose the torus into two open sets with non-empty intersection.\n\nConsider the torus as the quotient space of the square [0,1] x [0,1] with the edges identified as follows: (0, y) ~ (1, y) and (x, 0) ~ (x, 1). Now, let's decompose the torus into two open sets A and B as follows:\n\n- A: The interior of the square (0,1) x (0,1) with the edges removed.\n- B: A smaller square (1/4, 3/4) x (1/4, 3/4) with the edges identified as in the torus.\n\nThe intersection A ∩ B is an open annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1.\n\nNow, we apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of A is trivial, as A is contractible. The fundamental group of B is the same as the fundamental group of the torus, as B is a deformation retract of the torus. The fundamental group of A ∩ B is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the circle S^1, which is isomorphic to the integers Z.\n\nBy the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we have:\n\nπ_1(Torus) = π_1(A) * π_1(B) / π_1(A ∩ B) = {1} * π_1(B) / Z\n\nTo determine π_1(B), we need to find the generators of the fundamental group of the torus. There are two natural loops on the torus: one that goes around the \"hole\" (let's call it a) and one that goes around the \"tube\" (let's call it b). These loops are not homotopic to each other, and their commutator [a, b] = aba^(-1)b^(-1) is non-trivial. Thus, the fundamental group of the torus is generated by these two loops, and we have:\n\nπ_1(Torus) = π_1(B) = <a, b | [a, b]>\n\nSince there are no other relations between a and b, the fundamental group of the torus is the free group on two generators:\n\nπ_1(Torus) = Z x Z\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the torus is isomorphic to the direct product of the integers Z with itself, denoted as Z x Z."
