    "message_2": "A Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve process to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side is multiplied by 4/3. Since there are three sides in an equilateral triangle, the perimeter of the Koch island after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (4/3)^n * Initial side length\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter after four iterations (n = 4):\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (4/3)^4 * 1\nPerimeter = 3 * (256/81)\nPerimeter = 768/81 â‰ˆ 9.481\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after four iterations is approximately 9.481 units."
