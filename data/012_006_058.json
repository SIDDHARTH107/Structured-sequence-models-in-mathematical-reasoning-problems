    "message_2": "Yes, there is a Hamiltonian circuit in this graph. A Hamiltonian circuit is a closed loop on a graph where every vertex is visited exactly once, and the starting and ending vertices are the same.\n\nHere is the sequence of vertices in the Hamiltonian circuit:\n\n1 → 2 → 3 → 6 → 4 → 5 → 1\n\nThis circuit visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, satisfying the conditions for a Hamiltonian circuit."
