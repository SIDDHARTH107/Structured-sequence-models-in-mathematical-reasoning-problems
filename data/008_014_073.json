    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces three products X, Y, and Z. Each product requires time on three different machines, and the total time required for each product is given by the following table:\n\n| Machine  | Product X | Product Y | Product Z |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Machine 1 | 2         | 3         | 2         |\n| Machine 2 | 1         | 1         | 2         |\n| Machine 3 | 1         | 1         | 1         |\n\nThe company has 12 hours available on machine 1, 10 hours available on machine 2, and 7 hours available on machine 3. \n\nWhat is the maximum number of X, Y, and Z products that the company can produce using the available machines? \n\nSolve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition method.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the QR decomposition method, we first need to set up the system of equations based on the given information:\n\n2X + 3Y + 2Z ≤ 12 (Machine 1)\nX + Y + 2Z ≤ 10 (Machine 2)\nX + Y + Z ≤ 7 (Machine 3)\n\nWe want to maximize the number of products X, Y, and Z produced. Let's write the objective function:\n\nObjective: Maximize P = X + Y + Z\n\nNow, we need to find the QR decomposition of the matrix A, where A is the matrix of coefficients of the system of equations:\n\nA = | 2 3 2 |\n    | 1 1 2 |\n    | 1 1 1 |\n\nQR decomposition is a method to decompose a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R, such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (e.g., Python, MATLAB), we get:\n\nQ = | -0.89 -0.30  0.33 |\n    | -0.45  0.24 -0.86 |\n    | -0.45  0.90  0.33 |\n\nR = | -2.24 -3.35 -2.68 |\n    |  0    1.63  0.61 |\n    |  0    0    0.67 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations RX = Q^Tb, where b is the vector of the right-hand side of the inequalities:\n\nb = | 12 |\n    | 10 |\n    |  7 |\n\nQ^Tb = | -0.89 -0.45 -0.45 | | 12 |\n       | -0.30  0.24  0.90 | | 10 |\n       |  0.33 -0.86  0.33 | |  7 |\n\nQ^Tb = | -15.3 |\n       |   4.2 |\n       |  -4.5 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations RX = Q^Tb using back-substitution:\n\nR = | -2.24 -3.35 -2.68 | X = | -15.3 |\n    |  0    1.63  0.61 |     |   4.2 |\n    |  0    0    0.67 |     |  -4.5 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nX ≈ 3.4\nY ≈ 4.6\nZ ≈ -6.7\n\nSince we cannot produce a negative number of products, we set Z = 0 and solve the system again:\n\n2X + 3Y ≤ 12\nX + Y ≤ 10\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nX ≈ 3.6\nY ≈ 4.4\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a product, we round down the values:\n\nX = 3\nY = 4\nZ = 0\n\nSo, the maximum number of products that the company can produce using the available machines is 3 units of product X, 4 units of product Y, and 0 units of product Z."
