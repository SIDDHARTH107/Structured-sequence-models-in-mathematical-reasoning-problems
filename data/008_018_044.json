    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using block matrices, we first write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  -1  -1 |\n    | 2   1   1 |\n    | 1   2   3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  5 |\n    |  6 |\n    | 14 |\n\nNow, we can use the block matrix method to find the inverse of matrix A, which we'll call A_inv. Then, we can multiply A_inv by B to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, we need to find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 1(1*3 - 2*1) - (-1)(2*3 - 1*1) - (-1)(2*1 - 1*2)\n       = 1(1) + 1(5) + 1(0)\n       = 1 + 5\n       = 6\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find the inverse of A:\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nadj(A) is the adjugate of A, which is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A:\n\nadj(A) = |  (1*3 - 2*1)  -(2*3 - 1*1)   (2*1 - 1*2) |\n         | -(1*3 - 2*1)   (1*3 - 1*1)  -(1*1 - 1*2) |\n         |  (1*1 - 2*1)  -(1*1 - 1*2)   (1*1 - 1*1) |\n\nadj(A) = |  1  -5   0 |\n         | -1   2   1 |\n         | -1   1   0 |\n\nNow, we can find A_inv:\n\nA_inv = (1/6) * |  1  -5   0 |\n                | -1   2   1 |\n                | -1   1   0 |\n\nA_inv = |  1/6  -5/6   0  |\n        | -1/6   1/3   1/6|\n        | -1/6   1/6   0  |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z by multiplying A_inv by B:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = |  1/6  -5/6   0  |  |  5 |\n    | -1/6   1/3   1/6|  |  6 |\n    | -1/6   1/6   0  |  | 14 |\n\nX = | (1/6)*5 + (-5/6)*6 + 0*14 |\n    | (-1/6)*5 + (1/3)*6 + (1/6)*14|\n    | (-1/6)*5 + (1/6)*6 + 0*14    |\n\nX = |  5/6 - 30/6  |\n    | -5/6 + 12/6 + 14/6|\n    | -5/6 + 6/6       |\n\nX = | -25/6 |\n    |  21/6 |\n    |   1/6 |\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z are:\n\nx = -25/6\ny = 21/6 = 7/2\nz = 1/6"
