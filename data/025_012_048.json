    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x + 2$ at the point $P = (1,1)$, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. \n\nImplicitly differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$:\n\n$$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 1$$\n\nNow, solve for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2 - 1}{2y}$$\n\nNext, find the slope of the tangent line at the point $P = (1,1)$ by plugging the coordinates into the derivative:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3(1)^2 - 1}{2(1)} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at point $P$ is $1$. Now, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$\n\nPlug in the coordinates of point $P$ and the slope:\n\n$$y - 1 = 1(x - 1)$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$y = x$$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x + 2$ at the point $P = (1,1)$ is $y = x$."
