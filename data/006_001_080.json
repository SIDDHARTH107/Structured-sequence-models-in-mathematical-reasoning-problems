    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of getting heads, which is 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 coin flips)\n- k is the number of successes we want (in this case, 3 heads)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(5, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 heads out of 5 coin flips:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\n         = 5! / (3! * 2!)\n         = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n         = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)\n         = 10\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=3) = C(5, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(5-3)\n       = 10 * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^(5-3)\n       = 10 * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^2\n       = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25\n       = 10 * 0.03125\n       = 0.3125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
