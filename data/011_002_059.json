    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of x^3y^2 in the expansion of (2x + 3y)^5, we can use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion of (a + b)^n is given by:\n\nT(k+1) = C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, a = 2x, b = 3y, n = 5, and we want the term with x^3y^2, so k = 2 (since b^k = (3y)^2 = y^2).\n\nNow, we can calculate the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 10\n\nNow, we can find the term T(3):\n\nT(3) = C(5, 2) * (2x)^(5-2) * (3y)^2\nT(3) = 10 * (2x)^3 * (3y)^2\nT(3) = 10 * 8x^3 * 9y^2\nT(3) = 720x^3y^2\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^3y^2 in the expansion of (2x + 3y)^5 is 720."
