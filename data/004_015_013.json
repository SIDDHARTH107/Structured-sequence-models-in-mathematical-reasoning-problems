    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we need to find the second derivative of the function and then find the points where the second derivative is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the points where f''(x) = 0:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is one inflection point at x = 2. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, plug x = 2 back into the original function f(x):\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) + 2 = 8 - 24 + 18 + 2 = 4\n\nThus, the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 is (2, 4)."
