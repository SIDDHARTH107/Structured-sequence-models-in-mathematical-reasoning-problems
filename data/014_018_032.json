    "message_2": "To decrypt the Caesar cipher, we will try shifting the letters by different amounts and look for a meaningful message. Since there are 25 possible shifts (excluding the original message), we can try each one and see which one gives us a coherent message.\n\nAfter trying different shifts, we find that shifting the letters by 3 positions back in the alphabet gives us the original message:\n\n\"It was the consistent and we can be pretty on the first always on the chaotic ways.\"\n\nSo, the decrypted message is: \"It was the consistent and we can be pretty on the first always on the chaotic ways.\""
