    "message_2": "To apply the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to ensure that the function is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval. In this case, the function represents the position of the car with respect to time, and it is reasonable to assume that it is continuous and differentiable on the given interval.\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem states that if a function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the instantaneous rate of change (derivative) at that point is equal to the average rate of change over the interval.\n\nIn this problem, we have a car traveling 60 miles in 2 hours. We can represent the position function as f(t), where t is the time in hours. The average speed of the car over the 2-hour interval is:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time) = 60 miles / 2 hours = 30 mph\n\nNow, we need to find if there was any point during the trip where the car exceeded a speed of 35 mph. According to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nSince the average speed is 30 mph, we have:\n\n30 = (f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nNow, let's see if there is a point where the car exceeded 35 mph. We need to find a point c where f'(c) > 35. We can use the same formula:\n\n35 < (f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nHowever, we know that the average speed is 30 mph, which means that the maximum possible value for the right side of the equation is 30. Therefore, there is no point during the trip where the car exceeded a speed of 35 mph."
