    "message_2": "To find the probability of a robbery occurring in the neighborhood, we need to divide the number of robberies by the total number of crimes reported.\n\nProbability of robbery = (Number of robberies) / (Total number of crimes)\n\nProbability of robbery = 8 / 120\n\nProbability of robbery = 0.0667 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nSo, the probability of a robbery occurring in the neighborhood is approximately 6.67%."
