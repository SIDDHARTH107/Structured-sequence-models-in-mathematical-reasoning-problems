    "message_2": "To solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method to find the feasible region and then identify the optimal solution.\n\nFirst, let's plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 3\n2. x - y ≤ 1\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at points (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), and (3,0).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function 3x + 4y at each vertex:\n\n1. At point (0,0): 3(0) + 4(0) = 0\n2. At point (0,1): 3(0) + 4(1) = 4\n3. At point (1,2): 3(1) + 4(2) = 11\n4. At point (3,0): 3(3) + 4(0) = 9\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 11, which occurs at the vertex (1,2). Therefore, the optimal solution is x = 1 and y = 2, and the maximum value of the objective function is 11."
