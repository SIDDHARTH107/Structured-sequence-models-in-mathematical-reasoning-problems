    "message_2": "First, let's construct the graph G with the given degree sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1). We can label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F, where A, B, and C have degree 2, and D, E, and F have degree 1.\n\nThe graph G can be constructed as follows:\n- A is connected to B and C.\n- B is connected to A and C.\n- C is connected to A and B.\n- D is connected to A.\n- E is connected to B.\n- F is connected to C.\n\nNow, we can find the automorphism group of G. An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms.\n\nIn this case, the automorphism group of G consists of the following permutations:\n1. The identity permutation: (A, B, C, D, E, F)\n2. The permutation that swaps A and B, and also swaps D and E: (B, A, C, E, D, F)\n3. The permutation that swaps A and C, and also swaps D and F: (C, B, A, F, E, D)\n4. The permutation that swaps B and C, and also swaps E and F: (A, C, B, D, F, E)\n\nThese are the only permutations that preserve the adjacency relation in G. Therefore, the automorphism group of G has 4 elements, and it can be represented as:\n\nAut(G) = {(A, B, C, D, E, F), (B, A, C, E, D, F), (C, B, A, F, E, D), (A, C, B, D, F, E)}"
