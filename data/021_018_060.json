    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company wants to maximize its profits by producing two products A and B. The production of each product requires a certain amount of labor and raw materials. The company has 500 units of labor and 800 units of raw materials available for production. The profit obtained from selling one unit of product A is $20 and the profit obtained from selling one unit of product B is $30. The production of each product produces waste materials that need to be disposed of, and the total amount of waste that can be disposed of is limited to 50 units. Use tabu search to determine how many units of each product the company should produce to maximize its profits.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and neighborhood structure. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: L_A * x + L_B * y <= 500 (where L_A and L_B are the labor units required for products A and B, respectively)\n2. Raw materials constraint: R_A * x + R_B * y <= 800 (where R_A and R_B are the raw material units required for products A and B, respectively)\n3. Waste constraint: W_A * x + W_B * y <= 50 (where W_A and W_B are the waste units produced by products A and B, respectively)\n4. Non-negativity constraint: x >= 0 and y >= 0\n\nThe neighborhood structure can be defined as the set of solutions obtained by increasing or decreasing the production of products A and B by one unit, while still satisfying the constraints.\n\nNow, we can apply the tabu search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a random starting solution (x, y) that satisfies the constraints.\n2. Set the tabu list size and the stopping criterion (e.g., maximum number of iterations or a target profit value).\n3. Repeat the following steps until the stopping criterion is met:\n   a. Generate the neighborhood of the current solution.\n   b. Select the best non-tabu solution from the neighborhood that satisfies the constraints.\n   c. Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list size exceeds the limit.\n   d. Update the current solution with the selected solution from step b.\n4. Return the best solution found during the search.\n\nNote that the actual numerical values for L_A, L_B, R_A, R_B, W_A, and W_B are not provided in the problem statement. To obtain a specific solution, you would need to know these values and apply the tabu search algorithm as described above."
