    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nLet G be a group of order 60. By Sylow's theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2^2 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 2^2 * 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1, 4, or 12.\n\nNow, we analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow subgroups P_2, P_3, and P_5 of orders 4, 3, and 5, respectively. Since the orders of these subgroups are pairwise coprime, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups: G ≅ P_2 × P_3 × P_5. This gives us one non-isomorphic group, the cyclic group of order 60: G ≅ Z_60.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, but four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since |P_2| = 4, P_2 is isomorphic to either Z_4 or Z_2 × Z_2. If P_2 ≅ Z_4, then G has a normal subgroup of order 20, and G ≅ Z_4 × Z_15. If P_2 ≅ Z_2 × Z_2, then G has a normal subgroup of order 20, and G ≅ Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_15. This case gives us two non-isomorphic groups.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 4\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and we obtain two non-isomorphic groups: G ≅ Z_3 × Z_20 and G ≅ Z_3 × Z_2 × Z_10.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since |P_5| = 5, P_5 is isomorphic to Z_5. G has a normal subgroup of order 12, and G ≅ Z_5 × A_4, where A_4 is the alternating group of degree 4. This case gives us one non-isomorphic group.\n\nOther combinations of n_2, n_3, and n_5 do not yield any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn summary, there are 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 60:\n\n1. G ≅ Z_60 (cyclic group of order 60)\n2. G ≅ Z_4 × Z_15\n3. G ≅ Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_15\n4. G ≅ Z_3 × Z_20\n5. G ≅ Z_3 × Z_2 × Z_10\n6. G ≅ Z_5 × A_4 (semi-direct product of Z_5 and the alternating group A_4)"
