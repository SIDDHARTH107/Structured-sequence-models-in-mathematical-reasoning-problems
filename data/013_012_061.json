The cost functions of the firms A and B are given by CA(QA) = 20QA and CB(QB) = 30QB respectively. Assuming that firm A is the leader, find the equilibrium quantity and price for firms A and B.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity and price for firms A and B in a Stackelberg duopoly model, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction function of firm B (the follower).\n2. Find the profit function of firm A (the leader) and maximize it by taking the first-order condition.\n3. Substitute the reaction function of firm B into the maximized profit function of firm A to find the equilibrium quantity for firm A.\n4. Use the reaction function of firm B to find the equilibrium quantity for firm B.\n5. Use the market demand function to find the equilibrium price.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function of firm B\nTo find the reaction function of firm B, we first need to find its profit function. The profit function of firm B is given by:\n\nΠB = P * QB - CB(QB)\n\nSince Q = QA + QB and P = 100 - Q, we can rewrite the profit function as:\n\nΠB = (100 - QA - QB) * QB - 30QB\n\nNow, we need to maximize the profit function of firm B with respect to QB. To do this, we take the first-order condition:\n\ndΠB/dQB = 100 - QA - 2QB - 30 = 0\n\nSolving for QB, we get the reaction function of firm B:\n\nQB = (70 - QA) / 2\n\nStep 2: Find the profit function of firm A and maximize it\nThe profit function of firm A is given by:\n\nΠA = P * QA - CA(QA)\n\nUsing the same substitution as before, we can rewrite the profit function as:\n\nΠA = (100 - QA - QB) * QA - 20QA\n\nNow, we substitute the reaction function of firm B (QB = (70 - QA) / 2) into the profit function of firm A:\n\nΠA = (100 - QA - (70 - QA) / 2) * QA - 20QA\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nΠA = (130 - 3QA / 2) * QA - 20QA\n\nNow, we need to maximize the profit function of firm A with respect to QA. To do this, we take the first-order condition:\n\ndΠA/dQA = 130 - 3QA - 20 = 0\n\nSolving for QA, we get the equilibrium quantity for firm A:\n\nQA = 50 / 3\n\nStep 3: Use the reaction function of firm B to find the equilibrium quantity for firm B\nSubstituting the equilibrium quantity for firm A (QA = 50 / 3) into the reaction function of firm B:\n\nQB = (70 - 50 / 3) / 2\n\nQB = 40 / 3\n\nStep 4: Use the market demand function to find the equilibrium price\nNow that we have the equilibrium quantities for both firms, we can use the market demand function to find the equilibrium price:\n\nQ = QA + QB = 50 / 3 + 40 / 3 = 90 / 3 = 30\n\nP = 100 - Q = 100 - 30 = 70\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantities and price for firms A and B are:\n\nQA = 50 / 3\nQB = 40 / 3\nP = 70"
