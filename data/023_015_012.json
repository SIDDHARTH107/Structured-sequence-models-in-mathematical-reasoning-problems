    "message_2": "To find the wavelength and frequency of the wave, we need to analyze the given wave equation using Fourier analysis. The wave equation is given by:\n\nf(x,t) = 2cos(3x+6t)+3sin(5x+10t)\n\nThis equation represents a superposition of two waves with different wave numbers (k) and angular frequencies (ω). We can rewrite the equation as:\n\nf(x,t) = A1*cos(k1*x - ω1*t) + A2*sin(k2*x - ω2*t)\n\nwhere A1 = 2, k1 = 3, ω1 = 6, A2 = 3, k2 = 5, and ω2 = 10.\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν) of each wave component using the following relationships:\n\nλ = 2π / k\nν = ω / 2π\n\nFor the first wave component (cosine term):\n\nλ1 = 2π / k1 = 2π / 3\nν1 = ω1 / 2π = 6 / 2π\n\nFor the second wave component (sine term):\n\nλ2 = 2π / k2 = 2π / 5\nν2 = ω2 / 2π = 10 / 2π\n\nSo, the wavelengths and frequencies of the two wave components are:\n\nλ1 ≈ 2.094, ν1 ≈ 0.955 (for the cosine term)\nλ2 ≈ 1.256, ν2 ≈ 1.591 (for the sine term)\n\nThe given wave equation is a superposition of these two waves with different wavelengths and frequencies."
