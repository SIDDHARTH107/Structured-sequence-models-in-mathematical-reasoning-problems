    "message_2": "To find the conformal map that maps the interior of the unit circle to the upper half plane, we will use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. We want to find the coefficients $a, b, c, d$ such that the unit circle maps to the upper half plane.\n\nFirst, let's find the images of three points on the unit circle under the transformation $g(z)$. We can choose $z = 1, i, -1$ for simplicity. We want the image of these points to lie on the real axis, since the boundary of the unit circle should map to the boundary of the upper half plane.\n\n1. For $z = 1$, we have:\n\n$$g(1) = \\frac{a + b}{c + d}$$\n\n2. For $z = i$, we have:\n\n$$g(i) = \\frac{ai + b}{ci + d}$$\n\n3. For $z = -1$, we have:\n\n$$g(-1) = \\frac{-a + b}{-c + d}$$\n\nNow, we want the images of these points to be real. This means that the imaginary parts of $g(1)$, $g(i)$, and $g(-1)$ must be zero. This gives us the following conditions:\n\n1. For $g(1)$, the expression is already real, so no condition is needed.\n\n2. For $g(i)$, we have:\n\n$$\\Im(g(i)) = \\frac{a - d}{c^2 + 1} = 0 \\implies a = d$$\n\n3. For $g(-1)$, we have:\n\n$$\\Im(g(-1)) = \\frac{b - c}{c^2 + 1} = 0 \\implies b = c$$\n\nNow we have $a = d$ and $b = c$. We can rewrite the Möbius transformation as:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{az + b}{bz + a}$$\n\nTo find the image of the point $z = i$, we can plug it into the transformation:\n\n$$g(i) = \\frac{ai + b}{bi + a}$$\n\nWe already know that $a = d$, so the imaginary part of $g(i)$ must be zero:\n\n$$\\Im(g(i)) = \\frac{a - d}{b^2 + 1} = 0 \\implies a = d$$\n\nSince $a = d$, we can simplify the expression for $g(i)$:\n\n$$g(i) = \\frac{ai + b}{bi + a} = \\frac{ai + b}{b(i - 1)}$$\n\nNow, we want the image of $i$ to be real. This means that the imaginary part of $g(i)$ must be zero:\n\n$$\\Im(g(i)) = \\frac{a - b}{b^2 + 1} = 0 \\implies a = b$$\n\nNow we have $a = b = c = d$. We can rewrite the Möbius transformation as:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{az + a}{az + a} = 1$$\n\nHowever, this transformation is constant and does not map the unit circle to the upper half plane. This means that there is no conformal map of the form $g(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$ that maps the interior of the unit circle to the upper half plane.\n\nAs for the function $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2$, it is not a conformal map that maps the interior of the unit circle to the upper half plane either. To see this, we can find the image of the point $z = i$ under $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(i) = (i)^2 - 2(i) + 2 = -1 - 2i + 2 = 1 - 2i$$\n\nThe point $1 - 2i$ is not in the upper half plane, so the function $f(z)$ does not map the interior of the unit circle to the upper half plane."
