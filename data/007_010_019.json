    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we can set up the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 1 (mod 4)\n\nThe Chinese remainder theorem states that there is a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli (in this case, 3 * 4 = 12). \n\nTo find the solution, we first compute the product of the moduli, M = 3 * 4 = 12. Then, we calculate the modular inverses. \n\nFor the first congruence, we have:\n\nM1 = M / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4\ny1 = the modular inverse of M1 (mod 3) = 1 (since 4 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\n\nFor the second congruence, we have:\n\nM2 = M / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3\ny2 = the modular inverse of M2 (mod 4) = 3 (since 3 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 4))\n\nNow, we can find the solution x:\n\nx = (2 * M1 * y1) + (1 * M2 * y2) = (2 * 4 * 1) + (1 * 3 * 3) = 8 + 9 = 17\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we can take the result modulo M:\n\nx = 17 (mod 12) = 5\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions is 5."
