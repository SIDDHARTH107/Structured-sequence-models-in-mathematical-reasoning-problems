    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the method of inverses, we first need to find the inverse of the coefficient matrix. However, you mentioned that the coefficient matrix is a singular matrix. A singular matrix is a matrix that does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot use the method of inverses to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to solve the system of linear equations."
