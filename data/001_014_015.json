    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √(18) in the lowest radical form, we need to find the prime factors of 18 and look for any perfect squares.\n\nThe prime factorization of 18 is 2 × 3 × 3. We can rewrite this as 2 × (3^2).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the square root expression as √(2 × (3^2)).\n\nSince the square root of a perfect square is an integer, we can simplify this expression as follows:\n\n√(2 × (3^2)) = √(2) × √(3^2) = √(2) × 3\n\nSo, the simplified expression in the lowest radical form is 3√(2)."
