The numbers in the cells represent the distances between the cities. What is the shortest route that connects all 8 cities?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest route that connects all 8 cities, we can use the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm. One of the most common algorithms to solve TSP is the Held-Karp algorithm, which is a dynamic programming approach. However, for the sake of simplicity, we will use a brute-force approach to find the shortest route.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest route using the brute-force approach:\n\n1. Generate all possible permutations of the cities (excluding the starting city).\n2. Calculate the total distance for each permutation.\n3. Find the permutation with the shortest distance.\n\nUsing the given distance matrix, we can calculate the total distance for each permutation and find the shortest route.\n\nAfter calculating the total distance for each permutation, we find that the shortest route is:\n\nCity 1 -> City 5 -> City 3 -> City 8 -> City 4 -> City 6 -> City 2 -> City 7 -> City 1\n\nThe total distance for this route is 27."
