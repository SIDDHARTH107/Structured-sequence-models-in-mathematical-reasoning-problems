    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: product A and product B. The production process involves two machines, machine X and machine Y. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours on machine X and 1 hour on machine Y. Each unit of product B requires 1 hour on machine X and 3 hours on machine Y. The factory has 50 hours of machine X time available per day and 120 hours of machine Y time available per day. \n \nIf the profit on each unit of product A is $10 and the profit on each unit of product B is $15,  how many units of each product should the factory produce each day in order to maximize profit subject to the available machine time on each machine?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for the available machine time can be represented as:\n\n2x + y ≤ 50 (machine X constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 120 (machine Y constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 50\ny ≤ -2x + 50\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 40\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 40), (30, 20), and (50, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 15(40) = $600\n3. P(30, 20) = 10(30) + 15(20) = $900\n4. P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 15(0) = $500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (30, 20), with a profit of $900. Therefore, the factory should produce 30 units of product A and 20 units of product B each day to maximize the profit."
