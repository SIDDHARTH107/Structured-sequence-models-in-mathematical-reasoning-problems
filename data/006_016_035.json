    "message_2": "To find the expected number of defective products, we can multiply the probability of a defect occurring by the total number of units produced.\n\nExpected number of defective products = Probability of defect * Total number of units\nExpected number of defective products = 0.05 * 5000\nExpected number of defective products = 250\n\nSo, the expected number of defective products is 250."
