    "message_1": "Let X be an algebraic variety with 3 independent linear systems of divisors: D1, D2, and D3. The canonical divisor of X is given as KX = -4D1 - 6D2 - 9D3. Compute the degree of X, assuming that the three divisors have no common components and each divisor has a degree of 3.",
    "message_2": "To compute the degree of X, we first need to find the dimension of X. Since there are 3 independent linear systems of divisors, the dimension of X is 3.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of X using the canonical divisor KX and the degrees of the divisors D1, D2, and D3. We know that the degree of a divisor is the sum of the coefficients of the canonical divisor.\n\nDegree(D1) = 3\nDegree(D2) = 3\nDegree(D3) = 3\n\nKX = -4D1 - 6D2 - 9D3\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the degree of an algebraic variety:\n\nDegree(X) = (Dimension(X) + 1) * Degree(KX)\n\nFirst, let's find the degree of KX:\n\nDegree(KX) = -4 * Degree(D1) - 6 * Degree(D2) - 9 * Degree(D3)\nDegree(KX) = -4 * 3 - 6 * 3 - 9 * 3\nDegree(KX) = -12 - 18 - 27\nDegree(KX) = -57\n\nNow, we can compute the degree of X:\n\nDegree(X) = (Dimension(X) + 1) * Degree(KX)\nDegree(X) = (3 + 1) * (-57)\nDegree(X) = 4 * (-57)\nDegree(X) = -228\n\nSo, the degree of the algebraic variety X is -228."
