    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to form a continuous curve. The length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be found using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (Square root of 2)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. So, we plug the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (Square root of 2)^10\n\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\n\nLength = 1 * 32\n\nLength = 32\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 32."
