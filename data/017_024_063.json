    "message_1": "How many non-isomorphic groups of order 96 are there and can you list all of them?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we need to analyze the prime factorization of 96 and use the formula for the number of groups of a given order.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Now, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order:\n\nf(p^a * q^b) = (a+1)(b+1) if p and q are distinct primes.\n\nIn our case, p = 2, a = 5, q = 3, and b = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nf(2^5 * 3^1) = (5+1)(1+1) = 6 * 2 = 12.\n\nSo, there are 12 non-isomorphic groups of order 96.\n\nListing all of them is a bit more involved, but we can provide a general description of the groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_96\n2. Direct products of cyclic groups: C_2 × C_48, C_3 × C_32, C_6 × C_16, C_8 × C_12, C_16 × C_6, and C_32 × C_3\n3. Semidirect products: (C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_3, (C_2 × C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_4, (C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_8, and C_4 ⋊ C_8\n4. Quaternion group extension: Q_16 ⋊ C_6\n\nThese are the 12 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
