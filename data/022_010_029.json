    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series centered at $z_0 = 1$, we first perform partial fraction decomposition on the function $f(z)$. We write $f(z)$ as the sum of two simpler functions:\n\n$$\\frac{z}{(z-1)(z-2)^2} = \\frac{A}{z-1} + \\frac{B}{z-2} + \\frac{C}{(z-2)^2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(z-1)(z-2)^2$, we get:\n\n$$z = A(z-2)^2 + B(z-1)(z-2) + C(z-1)$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$ by plugging in suitable values of $z$:\n\n1. For $z = 1$, we get $1 = A(1-2)^2 = A \\Rightarrow A = 1$.\n2. For $z = 2$, we get $2 = C(2-1) = C \\Rightarrow C = 2$.\n3. For $z = 0$, we get $0 = 1(-1)^2 + B(-1)(-2) + 2(-1) \\Rightarrow B = -1$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-1} - \\frac{1}{z-2} + \\frac{2}{(z-2)^2}$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series for each term:\n\n1. For $\\frac{1}{z-1}$, the Laurent series is already given as it is a simple pole.\n2. For $-\\frac{1}{z-2}$, we can write it as $-\\frac{1}{1 - (z-1)}$. Using the geometric series formula, we get the Laurent series as $-\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (z-1)^n$.\n3. For $\\frac{2}{(z-2)^2}$, we can write it as $\\frac{2}{(1 - (z-1))^2}$. Using the derivative of the geometric series formula, we get the Laurent series as $2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n(z-1)^{n-1}$.\n\nCombining all three series, we get the Laurent series for $f(z)$ centered at $z_0 = 1$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-1} - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (z-1)^n + 2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n(z-1)^{n-1}$$\n\nThe annulus of convergence for the series is determined by the region where the geometric series converges. Since the geometric series converges for $|z-1| < 1$, the annulus of convergence for the Laurent series is $0 < |z-1| < 1$."
