    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - 2v^2)\n\nNow, we'll find the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -4v)\n\nNext, we'll find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = -8uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 16v^2\n\nNow, we'll find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, -4)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -8)\n\nNext, we'll find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • N = -2\nM = r_uv • N = 4\nN = r_vv • N = 8\n\nNow, we'll find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 1), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = -8(1)(-1) = 8\nG = 1 + 16(-1)^2 = 17\n\nL = -2\nM = 4\nN = 8\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = ((-2)(8) - (4)^2) / ((5)(17) - (8)^2)\nK = (-16 - 16) / (85 - 64)\nK = -32 / 21\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at point (1, -1, 1) is K = -32/21."
