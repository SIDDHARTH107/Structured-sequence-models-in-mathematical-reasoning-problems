    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation 2cos(x) + 1 = 0, we first isolate the cosine function:\n\n2cos(x) = -1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\ncos(x) = -1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the angles x between 0 and 360 degrees for which the cosine is -1/2. The angles are:\n\nx = 120 degrees and x = 240 degrees\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x = 120° and x = 240°."
