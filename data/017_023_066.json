    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we first need to find the prime factorization of 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nNow we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is based on the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. The formula is:\n\nf(n) = (p_1 + 1)(p_2 + 1)...(p_k + 1)\n\nwhere p_i are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of n.\n\nFor our case, the formula becomes:\n\nf(72) = (3 + 1)(2 + 1) = 4 * 3 = 12\n\nHowever, this formula gives us an upper bound on the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72. To find the exact number, we need to consider the possible structures of these groups and eliminate any isomorphic groups.\n\nThe possible structures of groups of order 72 are:\n\n1. C_72 (cyclic group)\n2. C_36 x C_2\n3. C_24 x C_3\n4. C_18 x C_4\n5. C_12 x C_6\n6. C_9 x C_8\n7. C_8 x C_9\n8. (C_4 x C_2) x C_9\n9. C_6 x C_12\n10. C_3 x C_24\n11. C_2 x C_36\n\nAfter eliminating isomorphic groups, we are left with the following non-isomorphic groups:\n\n1. C_72\n2. C_36 x C_2\n3. C_24 x C_3\n4. C_18 x C_4\n5. C_12 x C_6\n6. C_9 x C_8\n7. (C_4 x C_2) x C_9\n\nSo, there are 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
