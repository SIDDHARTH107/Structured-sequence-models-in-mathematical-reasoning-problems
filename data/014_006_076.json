You have a pad with a random sequence of 8-bit numbers.\n\n1) If the random sequence in your pad is \"01110010\", what is the encrypted message?\n2) If the encrypted message received by your friend is \"11001110\" and the random sequence in their pad is \"00110100\", what is the original message you sent?",
