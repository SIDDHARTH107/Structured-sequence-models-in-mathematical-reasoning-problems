The distances (in miles) between the houses are as follows: \n- AB = 3\n- AC = 4\n- AD = 2\n- AE = 5\n- AF = 6\n- BC = 1\n- BD = 1\n- BE = 4\n- BF = 5\n- CD = 6\n- CE = 3\n- CF = 2\n- DE = 1\n- DF = 7\n- EF = 5\n\nWhat is the shortest distance the mail carrier can travel to deliver mail to all six houses, and what is the order in which they should visit the houses?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance, we can use the given distances between the houses and try to find a path that minimizes the total distance traveled. We can start by looking for the shortest distances between the houses and try to form a path.\n\n1. Start at house A, since AD is the shortest distance (2 miles) from A, go to house D.\n2. From house D, DE is the shortest distance (1 mile), go to house E.\n3. From house E, EB is the shortest distance (4 miles), go to house B.\n4. From house B, BC is the shortest distance (1 mile), go to house C.\n5. From house C, CF is the shortest distance (2 miles), go to house F.\n\nThe order in which the mail carrier should visit the houses is A → D → E → B → C → F.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance traveled:\n\nAD + DE + EB + BC + CF = 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 10 miles\n\nThe shortest distance the mail carrier can travel to deliver mail to all six houses is 10 miles, and the order in which they should visit the houses is A → D → E → B → C → F."
