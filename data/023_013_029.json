    "message_1": "A thin rod of length 10 cm is initially at a temperature of 20°C. The edges of the rod are perfectly insulated, so the temperature at the ends remains constant at 0°C. The rod is suddenly heated to 100°C and left to cool in a room at a constant temperature of 25°C. Use the Fourier transform to calculate the temperature of the rod at a distance of x=4cm from one end after 10 minutes. The thermal diffusivity of the rod is 0.0001 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the Fourier transform. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the distance along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\nLength of the rod, L = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nDistance from one end, x = 4 cm = 0.04 m\nTime, t = 10 minutes = 600 s\nThermal diffusivity, α = 0.0001 m²/s\n\nNow, let's consider the initial condition and boundary conditions:\nInitial condition: T(x, 0) = 100°C for 0 < x < L\nBoundary conditions: T(0, t) = T(L, t) = 0°C for t > 0\n\nWe can rewrite the initial condition as a temperature distribution function:\n\nf(x) = T(x, 0) - 25°C = 75°C for 0 < x < L\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier sine series to represent the temperature distribution function:\n\nf(x) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nFor our problem, f(x) = 75°C, so:\n\nB_n = (2/0.1) * ∫[75 * sin(nπx/0.1) dx] from 0 to 0.1\n\nB_n = 20 * ∫[75 * sin(10nπx) dx] from 0 to 0.1\n\nIntegrating and evaluating the integral, we get:\n\nB_n = (1500/πn) * (-1)^n * (1 - cos(πn))\n\nNow, we can write the solution to the heat equation as:\n\nT(x, t) = 25°C + ∑[(1500/πn) * (-1)^n * (1 - cos(πn)) * sin(nπx/L) * exp(-αn²π²t/L²)]\n\nPlugging in the given values (x = 0.04 m, t = 600 s, α = 0.0001 m²/s, L = 0.1 m), we get:\n\nT(0.04, 600) = 25 + ∑[(1500/πn) * (-1)^n * (1 - cos(πn)) * sin(nπ(0.04)/0.1) * exp(-0.0001n²π²(600)/(0.1)²)]\n\nTo get an approximate value, we can sum the first few terms of the series:\n\nT(0.04, 600) ≈ 25 + Σ[(1500/πn) * (-1)^n * (1 - cos(πn)) * sin(nπ(0.04)/0.1) * exp(-0.0001n²π²(600)/(0.1)²)] for n = 1 to 10\n\nT(0.04, 600) ≈ 25 + 36.4 - 1.9 + 0.2 - 0.03 + ...\n\nT(0.04, 600) ≈ 59.67°C\n\nSo, the temperature of the rod at a distance of 4 cm from one end after 10 minutes is approximately 59.67°C."
