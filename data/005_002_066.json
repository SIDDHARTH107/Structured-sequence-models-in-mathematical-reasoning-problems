They randomly sampled 50 students and found that their mean age was 18.5 years with a standard deviation of 2.3 years. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean age of all students in their school.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean age, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nSample Mean = 18.5 years\nStandard Deviation = 2.3 years\nSample Size = 50 students\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 2.3 / √(50) ≈ 0.325\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.325 ≈ 0.637\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 18.5 ± 0.637\n\nLower Bound = 18.5 - 0.637 ≈ 17.863\nUpper Bound = 18.5 + 0.637 ≈ 19.137\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean age of all students in the school is approximately (17.863, 19.137) years."
