    "message_1": "A math student is asked to solve the following numerical problem related to the forced van der Pol oscillator:\n\nConsider the forced van der Pol oscillator x'' + ε(x^2 - 1)x' + x = Acos(ωt), where ε = 0.1, A = 2, and ω = 1.5. Assume that x(0) = 1 and x'(0) = 0.\n\nFind the amplitude and phase angle of the steady-state response of the forced van der Pol oscillator.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase angle of the steady-state response of the forced van der Pol oscillator, we first need to find the particular solution of the given equation. The particular solution will have the form:\n\nx_p(t) = Xcos(ωt - φ)\n\nwhere X is the amplitude and φ is the phase angle. We will also need the first and second derivatives of x_p(t):\n\nx_p'(t) = -Xωsin(ωt - φ)\nx_p''(t) = -Xω^2cos(ωt - φ)\n\nNow, we substitute x_p(t), x_p'(t), and x_p''(t) into the given equation:\n\n-x_p''(t) + ε(x_p(t)^2 - 1)x_p'(t) + x_p(t) = Acos(ωt)\n\nPlugging in the expressions for x_p(t), x_p'(t), and x_p''(t), we get:\n\nXω^2cos(ωt - φ) + ε((Xcos(ωt - φ))^2 - 1)(-Xωsin(ωt - φ)) + Xcos(ωt - φ) = 2cos(ωt)\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of cos(ωt) and sin(ωt) on both sides of the equation:\n\nFor cos(ωt):\nXω^2 + X = 2\n\nFor sin(ωt):\nε(X^2 - 1)(-Xω) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation for X, we get:\n\nX(ω^2 + 1) = 2\nX = 2 / (ω^2 + 1)\nX = 2 / (1.5^2 + 1)\nX ≈ 0.485\n\nNow, solving the second equation for φ, we notice that since ε ≠ 0 and ω ≠ 0, we must have:\n\nX^2 - 1 = 0\nX = ±1\n\nHowever, we already found that X ≈ 0.485, which is not equal to ±1. This means that the forced van der Pol oscillator does not have a simple steady-state response in terms of amplitude and phase angle.\n\nIn this case, we cannot find a simple expression for the amplitude and phase angle of the steady-state response of the forced van der Pol oscillator. A numerical approach, such as using a Runge-Kutta method or other numerical integration techniques, would be necessary to approximate the solution."
