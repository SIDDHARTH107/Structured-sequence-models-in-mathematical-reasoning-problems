    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A × B) and (B × A).\n\n(A × B) × (B × A) = {((1, 3), (3, 1)), ((1, 3), (3, 2)), ((1, 3), (4, 1)), ((1, 3), (4, 2)), ((1, 4), (3, 1)), ((1, 4), (3, 2)), ((1, 4), (4, 1)), ((1, 4), (4, 2)), ((2, 3), (3, 1)), ((2, 3), (3, 2)), ((2, 3), (4, 1)), ((2, 3), (4, 2)), ((2, 4), (3, 1)), ((2, 4), (3, 2)), ((2, 4), (4, 1)), ((2, 4), (4, 2))}\n\nNow, let's check if the result is associative with respect to union. Associativity means that for any sets X, Y, and Z, (X ∪ Y) ∪ Z = X ∪ (Y ∪ Z).\n\nLet X = A × B, Y = B × A, and Z = A. We will check if (X ∪ Y) ∪ Z = X ∪ (Y ∪ Z).\n\n(X ∪ Y) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n(Y ∪ Z) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), 1, 2}\nX ∪ (Y ∪ Z) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), 1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find (X ∪ Y) ∪ Z.\n\n(X ∪ Y) ∪ Z = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), 1, 2}\n\nSince (X ∪ Y) ∪ Z = X ∪ (Y ∪ Z), the result is associative with respect to union. However, it is important to note that this is just a specific example, and it does not prove that the Cartesian product is always associative with respect to union. In general, the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to union."
