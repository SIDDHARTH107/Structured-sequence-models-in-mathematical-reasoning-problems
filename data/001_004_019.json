    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 6x^3 - 30x^2 + 36x, we first look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. The GCF of 6x^3, -30x^2, and 36x is 6x. We can then factor out the GCF from each term:\n\n6x(x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x)\n\nNow, we can further factor the polynomial inside the parentheses:\n\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 6x = x(x^2 - 5x + 6)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic x^2 - 5x + 6. To do this, we look for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. These numbers are -2 and -3. So, we can factor the quadratic as:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can put everything together:\n\n6x(x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x) = 6x * x(x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n6x(x - 2)(x - 3)"
