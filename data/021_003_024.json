    "message_2": "To find the interpolated value of y for x = 4 and the extrapolated value of y for x = 10 using Lagrange polynomials, we first need to construct the Lagrange polynomial for the given data points.\n\nThe Lagrange polynomial is given by:\n\nL(x) = y1 * l1(x) + y2 * l2(x) + y3 * l3(x) + y4 * l4(x)\n\nwhere li(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials:\n\nl1(x) = (x - x2)(x - x3)(x - x4) / [(x1 - x2)(x1 - x3)(x1 - x4)]\nl2(x) = (x - x1)(x - x3)(x - x4) / [(x2 - x1)(x2 - x3)(x2 - x4)]\nl3(x) = (x - x1)(x - x2)(x - x4) / [(x3 - x1)(x3 - x2)(x3 - x4)]\nl4(x) = (x - x1)(x - x2)(x - x3) / [(x4 - x1)(x4 - x2)(x4 - x3)]\n\nGiven the data points (1, 3), (3, 7), (5, 2), and (7, 11), we can calculate the Lagrange basis polynomials:\n\nl1(x) = (x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) / [(1 - 3)(1 - 5)(1 - 7)]\nl2(x) = (x - 1)(x - 5)(x - 7) / [(3 - 1)(3 - 5)(3 - 7)]\nl3(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 7) / [(5 - 1)(5 - 3)(5 - 7)]\nl4(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 5) / [(7 - 1)(7 - 3)(7 - 5)]\n\nNow, we can find the interpolated value of y for x = 4:\n\nL(4) = 3 * l1(4) + 7 * l2(4) + 2 * l3(4) + 11 * l4(4)\nL(4) ≈ 4.4\n\nSo, the interpolated value of y for x = 4 is approximately 4.4.\n\nNext, we can find the extrapolated value of y for x = 10:\n\nL(10) = 3 * l1(10) + 7 * l2(10) + 2 * l3(10) + 11 * l4(10)\nL(10) ≈ 53.5\n\nSo, the extrapolated value of y for x = 10 is approximately 53.5."
