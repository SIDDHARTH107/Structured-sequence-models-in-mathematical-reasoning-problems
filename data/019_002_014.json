    "message_1": "Consider the statement: \"For all integers x and y, if x + y is even, then x and y are both even or both odd.\" Using predicate logic, express this statement symbolically and prove that it is true for all integers x and y.",
    "message_2": "To express the statement symbolically using predicate logic, we can use the following predicates:\n\nE(x): x is even\nO(x): x is odd\n\nThe statement can be written as:\n\n∀x, y ∈ Z, (E(x + y) → (E(x) ∧ E(y)) ∨ (O(x) ∧ O(y)))\n\nNow, let's prove that this statement is true for all integers x and y.\n\nProof:\n\nLet x and y be arbitrary integers. We want to show that if x + y is even, then x and y are both even or both odd.\n\nCase 1: x and y are both even.\n\nIf x and y are both even, then there exist integers a and b such that x = 2a and y = 2b. Therefore, x + y = 2a + 2b = 2(a + b), which is even. In this case, the statement holds.\n\nCase 2: x and y are both odd.\n\nIf x and y are both odd, then there exist integers a and b such that x = 2a + 1 and y = 2b + 1. Therefore, x + y = (2a + 1) + (2b + 1) = 2(a + b + 1), which is even. In this case, the statement also holds.\n\nCase 3: x is even and y is odd (or vice versa).\n\nWithout loss of generality, let x be even and y be odd. Then there exist integers a and b such that x = 2a and y = 2b + 1. Therefore, x + y = 2a + (2b + 1) = 2(a + b) + 1, which is odd. In this case, the statement is vacuously true, as the antecedent (x + y is even) is false.\n\nSince the statement holds for all possible cases, we have proven that for all integers x and y, if x + y is even, then x and y are both even or both odd."
