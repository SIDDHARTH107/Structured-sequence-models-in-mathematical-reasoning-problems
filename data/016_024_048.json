    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal created by recursively removing the central square from each remaining square in the pattern. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square of each is removed.\n\nLet's first find the total number of squares removed after the 7th iteration.\n\nThe number of squares removed in each iteration can be calculated as follows:\n1st iteration: 1 square removed (3^0)\n2nd iteration: 8 squares removed (3^1)\n3rd iteration: 8^2 squares removed (3^2)\n...\n7th iteration: 8^6 squares removed (3^6)\n\nThe total number of squares removed after the 7th iteration is the sum of squares removed in each iteration:\n\nTotal squares removed = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5 + 3^6\n= 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729\n= 1093\n\nNow, let's find the side length of the smallest squares after the 7th iteration. Since the original square has a side length of 3 units, and in each iteration, the side length is divided by 3, the side length of the smallest squares after the 7th iteration is:\n\nSide length of smallest squares = 3 / (3^7) = 3 / 2187 = 1/729 units\n\nSince there are 8 smaller squares surrounding each removed square, the perimeter contributed by each removed square is 8 times the side length of the smallest squares:\n\nPerimeter contributed by each removed square = 8 * (1/729) = 8/729 units\n\nFinally, to find the total perimeter of the Sierpinski carpet after the 7th iteration, we multiply the perimeter contributed by each removed square by the total number of squares removed:\n\nTotal perimeter = (8/729) * 1093 = 8744/729 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Sierpinski carpet after the 7th iteration is 8744/729 units."
