    "message_1": "The abductive logic problem can be related to a mathematical equation. Here is an example:\n\nAn abductive language has six symbols: a, b, c, d, e, and f. Each symbol is either true (T) or false (F). How many distinct 5-symbol strings are there?",
    "message_2": "Since each of the six symbols can be either true (T) or false (F), there are 2 possible states for each symbol. In a 5-symbol string, the number of distinct combinations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of combinations = (Number of possible states)^(Number of symbols in the string)\n\nIn this case, there are 2 possible states (T or F) and 5 symbols in the string.\n\nNumber of combinations = 2^5 = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 distinct 5-symbol strings in this abductive language."
