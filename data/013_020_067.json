    "message_1": "In the Beauty Contest Game, let there be 100 players who must guess a number between 0 and 100. The winner will be the one whose guess is closest to 2/3 times the average of all guesses. What number should each player guess to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning, each player should try to guess 2/3 times the average of all guesses. However, since all players are trying to do the same, we can assume that the average guess will also be 2/3 times the maximum possible value, which is 100.\n\nSo, the average guess would be (2/3) * 100 = 200/3 ≈ 66.67.\n\nNow, to maximize their chances of winning, each player should guess 2/3 times this average value:\n\n(2/3) * 66.67 ≈ 44.44.\n\nTherefore, each player should guess approximately 44.44 to maximize their chances of winning. However, since other players might also guess this value, it could be beneficial to guess slightly above or below this value to increase the chances of being the closest to the target value."
