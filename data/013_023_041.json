    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student studying the Trust Game in Game Theory:\n\nIn a Trust Game, player 1 is given $20 and must decide how much to send to player 2, with the understanding that any amount sent will be tripled before player 2 receives it. Player 2 must then decide how much, if any, to return to player 1. If player 2 returns $x to player 1, then each player's payoff is equal to their own money plus the money they receive from the other player. \n\nFor example, if player 1 sends $10 to player 2, and player 2 returns $15 to player 1, then player 1's payoff is $20 (their initial money) + $45 (triple what they sent) + $15 (what player 2 returned) = $80, and player 2's payoff is $15 (what they kept) + $45 (what they received from player 1) = $60.\n\nIf player 1 sends $8 to player 2, and player 2 returns $0 to player 1, what is the payoff for each player?",
    "message_2": "If player 1 sends $8 to player 2, the amount will be tripled before player 2 receives it. So, player 2 will receive $8 * 3 = $24.\n\nSince player 2 returns $0 to player 1, player 1's payoff will be their initial money ($20) minus the amount they sent ($8) plus the amount returned by player 2 ($0). So, player 1's payoff is $20 - $8 + $0 = $12.\n\nPlayer 2's payoff will be the amount they received from player 1 ($24) minus the amount they returned to player 1 ($0). So, player 2's payoff is $24 - $0 = $24.\n\nTherefore, the payoff for each player is as follows:\n- Player 1: $12\n- Player 2: $24"
