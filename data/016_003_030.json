    "message_2": "The area enclosed by the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is difficult to calculate exactly, as the set has a fractal boundary with infinite complexity. However, we can approximate the area using numerical methods, such as the Monte Carlo method, which involves generating random points in a known area and counting the proportion of points that fall within the Mandelbrot set.\n\nFor a maximum iteration count of 10,000, the area enclosed by the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 1.50659177 square units. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the actual area may vary slightly depending on the specific numerical method used and the number of sample points."
