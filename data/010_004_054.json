    "message_2": "To determine if set A is compact, we need to check if it is both closed and bounded. A set is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nSet A = {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...} is a subset of the real numbers. \n\nFirst, let's check if A is bounded. A set is bounded if there exists a real number M such that |a| ≤ M for all a in A. In this case, we can see that all elements of A are positive and less than or equal to 1. So, we can choose M = 1, and |a| ≤ 1 for all a in A. Therefore, A is bounded.\n\nNow, let's check if A is closed. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points. The limit of the sequence 1/n as n approaches infinity is 0. However, 0 is not an element of A. Therefore, A does not contain all its limit points, and A is not closed.\n\nSince A is not closed, it cannot be compact. So, set A is not compact."
