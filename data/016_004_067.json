    "message_2": "The area of the boundary between the main cardioid and the large circle in the Mandelbrot set cannot be calculated directly, as the boundary is a fractal with an infinitely complex structure. However, we can approximate the area enclosed by the main cardioid and the large circle.\n\nThe main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set has the equation:\n\nr(θ) = (1 - cos(θ))/2\n\nTo find the area of the main cardioid, we can integrate the polar equation:\n\nA = 1/2 ∫[r(θ)]^2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nA ≈ 1.159\n\nThe large circle enclosing the Mandelbrot set has a radius of 2, so its area is:\n\nA = πr^2 = π(2^2) = 4π ≈ 12.566\n\nNow, we can approximate the area of the boundary by subtracting the area of the main cardioid from the area of the large circle:\n\nArea of boundary ≈ 12.566 - 1.159 ≈ 11.407\n\nHowever, this is only an approximation, as the actual boundary is a fractal with an infinitely complex structure."
