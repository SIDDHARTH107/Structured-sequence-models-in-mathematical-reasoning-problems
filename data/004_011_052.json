    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the height of the top of the ladder on the wall. We know that the ladder has a constant length of 10 feet, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nNow, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 3 feet per second, so dx/dt = 3 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt when y = 6 feet. To find the corresponding value of x when y = 6, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\nx^2 = 64\nx = 8\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(8)(3) + 2(6)(dy/dt) = 0\n\n48 + 12(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dt:\n\n12(dy/dt) = -48\ndy/dt = -48 / 12\ndy/dt = -4 ft/s\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 4 feet per second when it is 6 feet off the ground."
