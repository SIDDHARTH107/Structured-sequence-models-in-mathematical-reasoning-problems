    "message_1": "A company has 10 employees in the accounting department. The probability of any employee committing financial fraud is 0.05. What is the probability that at least one employee will commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one employee will commit financial fraud, we can first find the probability that none of the employees commit financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of an employee not committing financial fraud is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 10 employees, the probability that none of them commit financial fraud is 0.95^10 = 0.5987369.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one employee commits financial fraud by subtracting the probability that none of them commit financial fraud from 1.\n\nProbability (at least one employee commits financial fraud) = 1 - Probability (none commit financial fraud) = 1 - 0.5987369 = 0.4012631.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one employee will commit financial fraud is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
