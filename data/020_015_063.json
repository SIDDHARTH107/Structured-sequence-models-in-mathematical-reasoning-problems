    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be L meters and the width be W meters. Since we are fencing off three sides of the rectangular plot, we have the following equation for the perimeter:\n\nL + 2W = 200\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the garden, which is given by:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nFirst, we need to express either L or W in terms of the other variable using the perimeter equation. Let's solve for L:\n\nL = 200 - 2W\n\nNow, substitute this expression for L in the area equation:\n\nArea = (200 - 2W) * W\nArea = 200W - 2W^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dW = 200 - 4W = 0\n\nSolving for W:\n\n4W = 200\nW = 50\n\nNow, substitute this value of W back into the expression for L:\n\nL = 200 - 2(50)\nL = 200 - 100\nL = 100\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that will maximize the area are L = 100 meters and W = 50 meters. The maximum area of the garden is:\n\nArea = L * W\nArea = 100 * 50\nArea = 5000 square meters"
