    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of ways to partition an integer N into k distinct odd parts as P(N, k). To find a formula for P(N, k), we can use the following approach:\n\n1. First, we need to ensure that the sum of the k distinct odd parts is equal to N. Since each part is odd, their sum will be odd as well. Therefore, N must be odd for the partition to be possible.\n\n2. We can represent the k distinct odd parts as a sequence of increasing odd numbers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, where a_i is the i-th odd part. Since the smallest odd number is 1, we can start the sequence with a_1 = 1.\n\n3. To ensure that the parts are distinct, we can add 2 to each subsequent part in the sequence. So, a_2 = a_1 + 2, a_3 = a_2 + 2, and so on. In general, a_i = a_(i-1) + 2.\n\n4. Now, we can write the sum of the k distinct odd parts as:\n\nN = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_k = 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 + 2) + ... + (1 + 2(k - 1))\n\n5. Simplifying the sum, we get:\n\nN = k + 2(1 + 2 + ... + (k - 1))\n\n6. The sum of the first (k - 1) positive integers is given by the formula (k - 1)k / 2. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nN = k + 2((k - 1)k / 2)\n\n7. Solving for k, we get:\n\nk = (sqrt(8N + 1) - 1) / 2\n\nSince k must be an integer, the expression inside the square root (8N + 1) must be a perfect square. Therefore, P(N, k) will be the number of integer solutions for k that satisfy the equation above, given that N is odd and 8N + 1 is a perfect square."
