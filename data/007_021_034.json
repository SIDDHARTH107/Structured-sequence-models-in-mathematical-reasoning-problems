    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of N = 315 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers modulo N to integers modulo N. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N.\n2. Choose a random starting value x0.\n3. Iterate the function f(x) to generate a sequence of values: x1 = f(x0), x2 = f(x1), x3 = f(x2), ...\n4. At each step, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between the current value and the previous value, and N: d = GCD(|xi - xi-1|, N).\n5. If d is a non-trivial factor of N (1 < d < N), then d is a prime factor of N. Otherwise, continue iterating.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm to N = 315:\n\n1. We will use the function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 315.\n2. Let's choose a random starting value x0 = 2.\n3. Generate the sequence of values using f(x):\n   x1 = f(x0) = (2^2 + 1) mod 315 = 5\n   x2 = f(x1) = (5^2 + 1) mod 315 = 26\n   x3 = f(x2) = (26^2 + 1) mod 315 = 32\n   ...\n4. Compute the GCD at each step:\n   GCD(|x1 - x0|, 315) = GCD(3, 315) = 3\n5. We found a non-trivial factor d = 3, which is a prime factor of 315.\n\nSo, the smallest prime factor of the composite number N = 315 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 3."
