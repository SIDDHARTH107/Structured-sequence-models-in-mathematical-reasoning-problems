The cost of each road is given below:\nRoad 1 - $10, Road 2 - $6, Road 3 - $5, Road 4 - $15, Road 5 - $4, Road 6 - $8, Road 7 - $9, Road 8 - $7, Road 9 - $3, Road 10 - $12.\n\nWhat is the minimum cost to build a network of roads that connects all neighborhoods?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost to build a network of roads that connects all neighborhoods, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a minimum spanning tree algorithm. First, we sort the roads by their costs in ascending order:\n\n1. Road 9 - $3\n2. Road 5 - $4\n3. Road 3 - $5\n4. Road 2 - $6\n5. Road 8 - $7\n6. Road 6 - $8\n7. Road 7 - $9\n8. Road 1 - $10\n9. Road 10 - $12\n10. Road 4 - $15\n\nNow, we start adding the roads to our network, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add Road 9 - $3\n2. Add Road 5 - $4\n3. Add Road 3 - $5\n4. Add Road 2 - $6 (adding this road would create a cycle, so we skip it)\n5. Add Road 8 - $7\n6. Add Road 6 - $8 (adding this road would create a cycle, so we skip it)\n7. Add Road 7 - $9 (adding this road would create a cycle, so we skip it)\n8. Add Road 1 - $10 (adding this road would create a cycle, so we skip it)\n9. Add Road 10 - $12 (adding this road would create a cycle, so we skip it)\n10. Add Road 4 - $15 (adding this road would create a cycle, so we skip it)\n\nThe minimum cost to build a network of roads that connects all neighborhoods is $3 + $4 + $5 + $7 = $19."
