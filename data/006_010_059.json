    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, individuals affected by the disease) in n trials (in this case, the sample of 100 individuals)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence of the disease, which is 5% or 0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, not being affected by the disease, which is 95% or 0.95)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 individuals)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 10 individuals affected by the disease)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 10) = (100C10) * (0.05^10) * (0.95^90)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 100C10:\n\n100C10 = 100! / (10!(100-10)!)\n= 100! / (10!90!)\n= 17,310,309,456,440 / 3,628,800\n= 47,659\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = 47,659 * (0.05^10) * (0.95^90)\n= 47,659 * 9.765625e-14 * 0.0059205292\n\nP(X = 10) â‰ˆ 0.0264\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 out of 100 individuals from the demographic group will be affected by the disease is approximately 2.64%."
