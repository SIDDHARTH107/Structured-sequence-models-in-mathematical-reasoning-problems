    "message_1": "In a study of cancer patients, the survival time is measured in months from diagnosis until death or the end of the study period. The survival times for 8 randomly selected patients are as follows: 18, 12, 9, 6, 22, 27, 14, and 16 months. Determine the median survival time and the interquartile range.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the survival times in ascending order: 6, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 27.\n\nSince there are 8 data points, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th values. So, the median survival time is (14 + 16) / 2 = 15 months.\n\nTo find the interquartile range (IQR), we need to determine the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). \n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data, which is the average of the 2nd and 3rd values: (9 + 12) / 2 = 10.5 months.\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data, which is the average of the 6th and 7th values: (18 + 22) / 2 = 20 months.\n\nFinally, the interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between Q3 and Q1: IQR = 20 - 10.5 = 9.5 months."
