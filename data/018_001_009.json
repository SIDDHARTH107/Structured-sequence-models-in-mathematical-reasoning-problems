    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set Ø is a subset of set A.\n\nBy definition, a set B is a subset of a set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. In other words, if x is an element of B, then x must also be an element of A.\n\nThe empty set Ø has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in Ø that are not in A. Since there are no elements in Ø that contradict the definition of a subset, we can conclude that the empty set Ø is a subset of set A.\n\nIn general, the empty set is a subset of any set, as it always satisfies the definition of a subset."
