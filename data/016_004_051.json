    "message_2": "The largest circular disc that can be inscribed within the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is known as the Mandelbrot cardioid. The radius of this circle is 1/4. To find the area of the circle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle. In this case, r = 1/4.\n\nArea = π * (1/4)^2\nArea = π * (1/16)\nArea = π/16\n\nTo round the answer to the nearest hundredth, we calculate the numerical value of π/16:\n\nArea ≈ 0.19634954084936207\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area of the largest circular disc that can be inscribed within the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 0.20."
