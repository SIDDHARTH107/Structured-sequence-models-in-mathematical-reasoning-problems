    "message_2": "The tangent of 60 degrees is √3 or approximately 1.732. In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the tangent of 60 degrees is the ratio of the side opposite the 60-degree angle (the longer leg) to the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (the shorter leg). In this case, the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg, so the tangent of 60 degrees is √3."
