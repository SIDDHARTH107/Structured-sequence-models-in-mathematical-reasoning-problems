    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student:\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination method, solve the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 6  \n\nx - y + 2z = -1 \n\n3x + 2y - 4z = 5",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n2. Use row operations to transform the matrix into row-echelon form.\n3. Use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  6 |\n|  1 -1  2 | -1 |\n|  3  2 -4 |  5 |\n\nStep 2: Use row operations to transform the matrix into row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, we want to get a 1 in the top-left position. We can do this by swapping Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n|  1 -1  2 | -1 |\n|  2  3 -1 |  6 |\n|  3  2 -4 |  5 |\n\nNext, we want to get zeros below the 1 in the top-left position. We can do this by replacing Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and replacing Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n|  1 -1  2 | -1 |\n|  0  5 -5 |  8 |\n|  0  5 -10|  8 |\n\nNow, we want to get a 1 in the second row and second column. We can do this by dividing Row 2 by 5:\n\n|  1 -1  2 | -1 |\n|  0  1 -1 |  8/5 |\n|  0  5 -10|  8 |\n\nNext, we want to get zeros below the 1 in the second row and second column. We can do this by replacing Row 3 with (-5 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n|  1 -1  2 |  -1   |\n|  0  1 -1 |  8/5 |\n|  0  0  5 | -8/5 |\n\nFinally, we want to get a 1 in the third row and third column. We can do this by dividing Row 3 by 5:\n\n|  1 -1  2 |  -1   |\n|  0  1 -1 |  8/5 |\n|  0  0  1 | -8/25 |\n\nStep 3: Use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nNow that we have the matrix in row-echelon form, we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = -8/25\n\ny = 8/5 + z = 8/5 - 8/25 = (40 - 8) / 25 = 32/25\n\nx = -1 + y - 2z = -1 + 32/25 + 16/25 = (-25 + 32 + 16) / 25 = 23/25\n\nSo the solution is:\n\nx = 23/25\ny = 32/25\nz = -8/25"
