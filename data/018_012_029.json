    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersections and Cartesian products for each expression:\n\n1. A x (B ∩ B)\nSince B ∩ B is just B, we have:\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\n2. (B ∩ A) x B\nSince B ∩ A is the same as A ∩ B, we have:\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n(B ∩ A) x B = {(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\n3. (A x B) ∩ (A x B)\nSince the intersection of a set with itself is just the set, we have:\n(A x B) ∩ (A x B) = A x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow let's compare the expressions:\n\nA x (B ∩ B) = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\n(B ∩ A) x B = {(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\n(A x B) ∩ (A x B) = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nFrom the above results, we can see that:\n\nA x (B ∩ B) = (A x B) ∩ (A x B)\n\nThe reason these two expressions are equal is because the intersection of B with itself is just B, and the intersection of A x B with itself is just A x B. Therefore, both expressions represent the Cartesian product of A and B.\n\nThe expression (B ∩ A) x B is different from the other two because it represents the Cartesian product of the intersection of A and B (which is {2, 3}) with B. This results in a smaller set of ordered pairs compared to the Cartesian product of A and B."
