    "message_2": "To find the velocity, v(t), we need to take the first derivative of the position function, s(t), with respect to time t:\n\ns(t) = 5t^2 - 3t + 2\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(5t^2 - 3t + 2)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = 10t - 3\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 3 seconds:\n\nv(3) = 10(3) - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27\n\nSo, the velocity at t = 3 seconds is 27 m/s.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration, a(t), by taking the first derivative of the velocity function, v(t), with respect to time t:\n\nv(t) = 10t - 3\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(10t - 3)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 10\n\nSince the acceleration function is a constant, the acceleration at t = 3 seconds is the same as the acceleration at any other time:\n\na(3) = 10\n\nSo, the acceleration at t = 3 seconds is 10 m/sÂ²."
