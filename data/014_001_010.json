    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext message in RSA encryption, we use the formula:\n\nciphertext = (plaintext^e) % n\n\nGiven the public key (e, n) = (5, 493) and the plaintext message is 123, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nciphertext = (123^5) % 493\n\nFirst, we need to calculate 123^5:\n\n123^5 = 28153056843\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when this value is divided by 493:\n\nciphertext = 28153056843 % 493 = 176\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext message is 176."
