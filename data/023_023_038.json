    "message_1": "Consider a network with two resistors, R1 = 2 Ω and R2 = 3 Ω, in series. The voltage across the network is given by the function v(t) = 5 sin(2πft), where f = 50 Hz. Use the Fourier transform to determine the amplitude of the component of v(t) at the fundamental frequency of the network.",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we are given a voltage function v(t) = 5 sin(2πft) with f = 50 Hz. We are asked to determine the amplitude of the component of v(t) at the fundamental frequency of the network using the Fourier transform.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a continuous-time function x(t) is given by:\n\nX(f) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} x(t) e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nHowever, in this case, we don't need to compute the Fourier transform because the given voltage function v(t) is already a sinusoidal function with a single frequency component at f = 50 Hz. The amplitude of the sinusoidal function is given directly by the coefficient of the sine function, which is 5.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the component of v(t) at the fundamental frequency of the network is 5 V."
