    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm and the length of its two parallel sides are 12 cm and 18 cm, respectively. What is the area of this trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 12 cm and 18 cm, and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 18) * 10\nArea = (1/2) * (30) * 10\nArea = 15 * 10\nArea = 150 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of this trapezoid is 150 square centimeters."
