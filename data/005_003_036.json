    "message_1": "Suppose you have collected data on the monthly sales (in thousands of dollars) of a certain product for the past year. You are interested in determining if there is a linear relationship between the sales and the marketing budget (in thousands of dollars). You run a regression analysis and obtain the following equation: \n\nMonthly Sales = 20 + 4 * Marketing Budget\n\nIf the marketing budget is increased by $5,000, what would be the predicted increase in monthly sales for this product according to the regression model?",
    "message_2": "The regression equation is:\n\nMonthly Sales = 20 + 4 * Marketing Budget\n\nIf the marketing budget is increased by $5,000 (which is equal to 5 in thousands of dollars), we can calculate the predicted increase in monthly sales as follows:\n\nPredicted Increase in Sales = 4 * Increase in Marketing Budget\nPredicted Increase in Sales = 4 * 5\nPredicted Increase in Sales = 20\n\nSo, according to the regression model, if the marketing budget is increased by $5,000, the predicted increase in monthly sales would be $20,000."
