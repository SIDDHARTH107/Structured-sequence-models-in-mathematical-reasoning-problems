    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 2z + 5 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(5))) / 2(1)\nz = (-2 ± √(4 - 20)) / 2\nz = (-2 ± √(-16)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, we know that the solutions will be complex numbers. We can rewrite the square root of -16 as 4i (where i is the imaginary unit, i.e., i^2 = -1):\n\nz = (-2 ± 4i) / 2\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\nz = -1 ± 2i\n\nSo, the two complex solutions for the equation z^2 + 2z + 5 = 0 are:\n\nz = -1 + 2i and z = -1 - 2i"
