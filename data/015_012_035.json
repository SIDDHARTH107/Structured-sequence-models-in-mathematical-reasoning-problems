    "message_2": "The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz system, which is a system of three ordinary differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\ndy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y\ndz/dt = xy - βz\n\nwhere σ, ρ, and β are positive parameters. In this case, σ = 10, ρ = 28, and β = 8/3.\n\nTo find the equilibrium points, we set the derivatives equal to zero:\n\nσ(y - x) = 0\nx(ρ - z) - y = 0\nxy - βz = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we find three equilibrium points:\n\n1. (0, 0, 0) - the origin\n2. (±√(β(ρ-1)), ±√(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1)\n\nFor the given parameters (σ = 10, ρ = 28, and β = 8/3), the two non-origin equilibrium points are:\n\n(±√[(8/3)(28-1)], ±√[(8/3)(28-1)], 27)\n\nSo, the maximum number of equilibrium points for the Lorenz attractor with these parameters is 3."
