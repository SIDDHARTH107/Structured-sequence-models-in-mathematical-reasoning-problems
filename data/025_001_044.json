    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product of the degrees of the curves, assuming that the curves have no common components.\n\nLet's first find the degrees of the given curves:\n\nC1: x^3 + y^3 - 3xy = 0\nThe degree of C1 is the highest power of any term, which is 3 (from x^3 and y^3).\n\nC2: x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 2y + 4 = 0\nThe degree of C2 is the highest power of any term, which is 2 (from x^2 and y^2).\n\nNow, we can apply Bezout's theorem:\n\nNumber of intersection points = (degree of C1) * (degree of C2) = 3 * 2 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 points of intersection of C1 and C2, counted with multiplicity."
