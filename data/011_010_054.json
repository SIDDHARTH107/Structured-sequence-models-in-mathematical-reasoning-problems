    "message_1": "A math student needs to count the number of ways that a mountain range of n+1 peaks can be traversed if the path always starts at the leftmost peak (at sea level) and ends at the rightmost peak (also at sea level) and never goes below sea level, meaning that the path always stays on or above the x-axis. How many such paths are there? (This is equivalent to finding the nth Catalan number.)",
    "message_2": "The number of such paths can be represented by the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have various applications in combinatorial mathematics, including counting certain types of lattice paths.\n\nThe nth Catalan number, denoted as C_n, can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nC_n = (1 / (n + 1)) * (2n choose n) = (1 / (n + 1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nwhere n! represents the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nSo, to find the number of ways to traverse a mountain range of n+1 peaks, you need to calculate the nth Catalan number using the formula above."
