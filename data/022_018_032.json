    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation, we can use the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations for this PDE are:\n\ndx/dt = i\ndu/dt = 0\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\nx(t) = it + x0\n\nwhere x0 is a constant. Now, we can solve the second equation:\n\ndu/dt = 0\n\nThis implies that u is constant along the characteristic curves. Therefore, u(x(t),t) = u(x0,0) for all t. Using the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(x) + 2i, we have:\n\nu(x(t),t) = sin(x0) + 2i\n\nNow, we can use the boundary condition u(0,t) = 1 to find the relationship between x0 and t. From the first characteristic equation, we have x0 = -it when x = 0. Thus, we have:\n\nu(0,t) = sin(-it) + 2i = 1\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between x0 and x(t) to find the complex-valued function u(x,t):\n\nu(x,t) = sin(it + x0) + 2i\n\nSince x0 = x - it, we have:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(x - it) + 2i\n\nThis is the complex-valued function u(x,t) that satisfies the given partial differential equation and the initial and boundary conditions."
