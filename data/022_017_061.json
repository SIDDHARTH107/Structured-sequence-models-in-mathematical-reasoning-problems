    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation $y'' + 4y = 0$, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is given by:\n\n$r^2 + 4 = 0$\n\nNow, we solve for r:\n\n$r^2 = -4$\n\n$r = \\pm 2i$\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x)$\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0) = 0$. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the general solution:\n\n$y'(x) = -2C_1 \\sin(2x) + 2C_2 \\cos(2x)$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\n1) $y(0) = 1$\n\n$1 = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0)$\n\n$1 = C_1$\n\n2) $y'(0) = 0$\n\n$0 = -2C_1 \\sin(0) + 2C_2 \\cos(0)$\n\n$0 = 2C_2$\n\n$C_2 = 0$\n\nSo, the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions is:\n\n$y(x) = \\cos(2x)$"
