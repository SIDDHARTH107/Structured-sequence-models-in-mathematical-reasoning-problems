    "message_1": "A math student wants to determine if the distribution of the grades of their classmates in a certain exam follows a normal distribution, but they cannot assume that the data is normally distributed. \n\nThe student collects the following grades: 76, 89, 62, 78, 83, 69, 82, 90, 75, 71, 88, 96, 82, 79, 85.\n\nWhat is the percentile rank of the student who got a grade of 75?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentile rank of the student who got a grade of 75, we first need to sort the grades in ascending order:\n\n62, 69, 71, 75, 76, 78, 79, 82, 82, 83, 85, 88, 89, 90, 96\n\nNow, we count the number of grades below 75 and the total number of grades:\n\nNumber of grades below 75: 3 (62, 69, 71)\nTotal number of grades: 15\n\nNext, we use the formula for percentile rank:\n\nPercentile Rank = (Number of grades below the target grade / Total number of grades) * 100\n\nPercentile Rank = (3 / 15) * 100 = 20%\n\nSo, the student who got a grade of 75 is at the 20th percentile rank."
