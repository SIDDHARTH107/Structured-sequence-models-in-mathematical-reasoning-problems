    "message_2": "To find the polynomial P(x) using Lagrange interpolation, we can use the formula:\n\nP(x) = L_0(x) * y_0 + L_1(x) * y_1 + L_2(x) * y_2\n\nwhere L_i(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials and y_i are the y-coordinates of the given data points.\n\nThe Lagrange basis polynomials are defined as:\n\nL_0(x) = (x - x_1)(x - x_2) / ((x_0 - x_1)(x_0 - x_2))\nL_1(x) = (x - x_0)(x - x_2) / ((x_1 - x_0)(x_1 - x_2))\nL_2(x) = (x - x_0)(x - x_1) / ((x_2 - x_0)(x_2 - x_1))\n\nUsing the given data points (2, 5), (5, 12), and (7, 9), we can calculate the Lagrange basis polynomials:\n\nL_0(x) = (x - 5)(x - 7) / ((2 - 5)(2 - 7)) = (x - 5)(x - 7) / 15\nL_1(x) = (x - 2)(x - 7) / ((5 - 2)(5 - 7)) = (x - 2)(x - 7) / -6\nL_2(x) = (x - 2)(x - 5) / ((7 - 2)(7 - 5)) = (x - 2)(x - 5) / 10\n\nNow, we can find the polynomial P(x):\n\nP(x) = L_0(x) * 5 + L_1(x) * 12 + L_2(x) * 9\nP(x) = (5/15)(x - 5)(x - 7) - (12/6)(x - 2)(x - 7) + (9/10)(x - 2)(x - 5)\n\nTo estimate the y-coordinate of the point halfway between the second and third data points, we need to find the x-coordinate halfway between 5 and 7:\n\nx_half = (5 + 7) / 2 = 6\n\nNow, we can plug this x-coordinate into our polynomial P(x):\n\nP(6) = (5/15)(6 - 5)(6 - 7) - (12/6)(6 - 2)(6 - 7) + (9/10)(6 - 2)(6 - 5)\nP(6) = (1/3)(1)(-1) - 2(4)(-1) + (9/10)(4)(1)\nP(6) = -1/3 + 8 + 36/10\nP(6) = 79/10\n\nSo, the estimated y-coordinate of the point halfway between the second and third data points is 79/10 or 7.9."
