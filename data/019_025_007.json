    "message_1": "If x is the number of hours a student studies per day and y is the grade they receive on a test, the causal logic states that y is directly proportional to x. A student who studies for 5 hours a day receives a score of 80 on a test. If they increase their study time to 7 hours per day, what grade should they expect to receive on their next test?",
    "message_2": "Since y is directly proportional to x, we can write the relationship as y = kx, where k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nWe are given that when x = 5 hours, y = 80. We can use this information to find the value of k.\n\n80 = k * 5\nk = 80 / 5\nk = 16\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can use it to find the expected grade when the student studies for 7 hours a day.\n\ny = 16 * 7\ny = 112\n\nThe student should expect to receive a grade of 112 on their next test if they increase their study time to 7 hours per day."
