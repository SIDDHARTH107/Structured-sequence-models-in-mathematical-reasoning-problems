    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 over the field F17, we will use the Hasse's theorem, which states that the order of the elliptic curve over a finite field Fp is in the range [p + 1 - 2√p, p + 1 + 2√p]. In our case, p = 17.\n\nFirst, let's find the range:\n\nLower bound: 17 + 1 - 2√17 ≈ 17 + 1 - 8.246 ≈ 9.754 (round up to 10)\nUpper bound: 17 + 1 + 2√17 ≈ 17 + 1 + 8.246 ≈ 26.246 (round down to 26)\n\nNow, we will count the points on the curve over F17. We will include the point at infinity, which is always on the curve.\n\n1. Point at infinity: 1 point\n\n2. Iterate through all x values in F17 (0 to 16) and check if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 (mod 17)\n\nFor each x value, if there is a valid y value, there will be two points (y and -y) on the curve.\n\nLet's calculate the points:\n\nx = 0: y^2 = 0^3 + 7*0 + 10 (mod 17) = 10 (mod 17)\nThere is no y in F17 such that y^2 = 10 (mod 17).\n\nx = 1: y^2 = 1^3 + 7*1 + 10 (mod 17) = 18 (mod 17) = 1 (mod 17)\ny = 1 and y = 16 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 2: y^2 = 2^3 + 7*2 + 10 (mod 17) = 24 (mod 17) = 7 (mod 17)\nThere is no y in F17 such that y^2 = 7 (mod 17).\n\nx = 3: y^2 = 3^3 + 7*3 + 10 (mod 17) = 46 (mod 17) = 12 (mod 17)\ny = 5 and y = 12 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 4: y^2 = 4^3 + 7*4 + 10 (mod 17) = 90 (mod 17) = 5 (mod 17)\nThere is no y in F17 such that y^2 = 5 (mod 17).\n\nx = 5: y^2 = 5^3 + 7*5 + 10 (mod 17) = 160 (mod 17) = 11 (mod 17)\ny = 3 and y = 14 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 6: y^2 = 6^3 + 7*6 + 10 (mod 17) = 262 (mod 17) = 2 (mod 17)\ny = 6 and y = 11 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 7: y^2 = 7^3 + 7*7 + 10 (mod 17) = 414 (mod 17) = 8 (mod 17)\nThere is no y in F17 such that y^2 = 8 (mod 17).\n\nx = 8: y^2 = 8^3 + 7*8 + 10 (mod 17) = 634 (mod 17) = 4 (mod 17)\ny = 2 and y = 15 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 9: y^2 = 9^3 + 7*9 + 10 (mod 17) = 946 (mod 17) = 1 (mod 17)\ny = 1 and y = 16 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 10: y^2 = 10^3 + 7*10 + 10 (mod 17) = 1410 (mod 17) = 16 (mod 17)\ny = 4 and y = 13 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 11: y^2 = 11^3 + 7*11 + 10 (mod 17) = 2074 (mod 17) = 0 (mod 17)\ny = 0 (1 point)\n\nx = 12: y^2 = 12^3 + 7*12 + 10 (mod 17) = 2986 (mod 17) = 16 (mod 17)\ny = 4 and y = 13 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 13: y^2 = 13^3 + 7*13 + 10 (mod 17) = 4298 (mod 17) = 1 (mod 17)\ny = 1 and y = 16 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 14: y^2 = 14^3 + 7*14 + 10 (mod 17) = 6160 (mod 17) = 4 (mod 17)\ny = 2 and y = 15 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 15: y^2 = 15^3 + 7*15 + 10 (mod 17) = 8622 (mod 17) = 2 (mod 17)\ny = 6 and y = 11 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nx = 16: y^2 = 16^3 + 7*16 + 10 (mod 17) = 11784 (mod 17) = 11 (mod 17)\ny = 3 and y = 14 satisfy the equation. (2 points)\n\nAdding up all the points, we get:\n\n1 (point at infinity) + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 25 points\n\nSo, the order of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 over the field F17 is 25."
