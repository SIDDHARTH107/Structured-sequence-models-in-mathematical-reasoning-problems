    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be written in matrix form as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A = |  2  3 -1 |\n          |  4  4 -3 |\n          | -2  2  1 |\n\nB = | 1 |\n      | 6 |\n      | 3 |\n\nand X = | x |\n          | y |\n          | z |\n\nNow, let's perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\n1. First, we find the L and U matrices:\n\nU = |  2   3  -1 |\n    |  0  -1   1 |\n    |  0   0   3 |\n\nL = |  1   0   0 |\n    |  2   1   0 |\n    | -1  -1   1 |\n\n2. Now, we solve the equation L * Y = B for Y:\n\nL * Y = |  1   0   0 | | y1 |   | 1 |\n        |  2   1   0 | | y2 | = | 6 |\n        | -1  -1   1 | | y3 |   | 3 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 1\ny2 = 4\ny3 = 2\n\nSo, Y = | 1 |\n          | 4 |\n          | 2 |\n\n3. Finally, we solve the equation U * X = Y for X:\n\nU * X = |  2   3  -1 | | x |   | 1 |\n        |  0  -1   1 | | y | = | 4 |\n        |  0   0   3 | | z |   | 2 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx = 1\ny = -1\nz = 2/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1\ny = -1\nz = 2/3"
