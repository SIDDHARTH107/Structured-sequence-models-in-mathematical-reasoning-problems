    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem on Epistemic Logic for a math student to solve:\n\nThere are 5 hats placed on a table, each of them has a unique color: red, green, blue, yellow, and black. Alice and Bob are sitting facing each other, and they can see each other but not their own hats. Now, Alice and Bob try to figure out the color of their own hat by making logical deductions based on what they can see. If they both use perfect epistemic logic, how many hats can they correctly guess?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. Alice sees the color of Bob's hat and vice versa.\n2. If Alice sees that Bob has a red hat, she knows that her hat can be green, blue, yellow, or black. Similarly, if Bob sees that Alice has a green hat, he knows that his hat can be red, blue, yellow, or black.\n3. Since neither Alice nor Bob can see their own hat, they cannot make any further deductions based on the color of the other person's hat.\n\nIn this situation, both Alice and Bob can only narrow down the possibilities of their own hat color to four options. They cannot make any further deductions based on the information available to them. Therefore, they cannot correctly guess the color of their own hat with certainty.\n\nSo, the answer is that they can correctly guess 0 hats."
