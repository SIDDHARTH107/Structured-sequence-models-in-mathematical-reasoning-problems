    "message_2": "We will use the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) for cohomology to determine the possible values of the cardinality of H^(1)(X) with integer coefficients.\n\nThe UCT states that for any topological space X and any abelian group G, there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H^(n-1)(X), G) → H^n(X, G) → Hom(H^n(X), G) → 0\n\nIn our case, we have n = 2 and G = Z (the integers). We are given that |H^(2)(X)| = 7, which implies that H^(2)(X) is isomorphic to Z_7 (the cyclic group of order 7). We want to find the possible values of |H^(1)(X)|.\n\nApplying the UCT for n = 2, we get:\n\n0 → Ext(H^(1)(X), Z) → H^2(X, Z) → Hom(H^2(X), Z) → 0\n\nSince H^2(X, Z) is isomorphic to Z_7, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H^(1)(X), Z) → Z_7 → Hom(H^2(X), Z) → 0\n\nNow, we know that Hom(Z_7, Z) = 0, since there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_7 to Z. Therefore, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H^(1)(X), Z) → Z_7 → 0\n\nThis implies that Ext(H^(1)(X), Z) is isomorphic to Z_7.\n\nNow, we apply the UCT for n = 1:\n\n0 → Ext(H^0(X), Z) → H^1(X, Z) → Hom(H^1(X), Z) → 0\n\nSince X is connected, H^0(X) is isomorphic to Z. Thus, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(Z, Z) → H^1(X, Z) → Hom(H^1(X), Z) → 0\n\nWe know that Ext(Z, Z) = 0 and Hom(H^1(X), Z) is isomorphic to H^1(X) (since H^1(X) is an abelian group). Therefore, we have:\n\n0 → H^1(X, Z) → H^1(X) → 0\n\nThis implies that H^1(X, Z) is isomorphic to H^1(X).\n\nNow, we have two short exact sequences:\n\n0 → Ext(H^(1)(X), Z) → Z_7 → 0\n0 → H^1(X, Z) → H^1(X) → 0\n\nSince Ext(H^(1)(X), Z) is isomorphic to Z_7 and H^1(X, Z) is isomorphic to H^1(X), we can conclude that H^1(X) is isomorphic to Z_7.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of the cardinality of H^(1)(X) with integer coefficients are |Z_7| = 7."
