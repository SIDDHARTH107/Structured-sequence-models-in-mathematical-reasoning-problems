    "message_2": "To find the rate of change of the concentration of the oscillating ion, we can use the formula:\n\nRate of change = (Final concentration - Initial concentration) / Time taken\n\nInitial concentration = 0.5 moles per liter\nFinal concentration = 0.9 moles per liter\nTime taken = 10 seconds\n\nRate of change = (0.9 - 0.5) / 10\nRate of change = 0.4 / 10\nRate of change = 0.04 moles per liter per second\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of the oscillating ion in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is 0.04 moles per liter per second."
