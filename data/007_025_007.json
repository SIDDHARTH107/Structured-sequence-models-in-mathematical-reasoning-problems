Bob computes B = (base number of Bob)^secret key of Bob mod modulus\nB = (5^4) mod 7\nB = 625 mod 7\nB = 1\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key: S_A = B^secret key of Alice mod modulus\nS_A = (1^3) mod 7\nS_A = 1 mod 7\nS_A = 1\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key: S_B = A^secret key of Bob mod modulus\nS_B = (1^4) mod 7\nS_B = 1 mod 7\nS_B = 1\n\nSince S_A and S_B are equal, the shared secret key is 1.
