    "message_1": "A company wants to ship its products from its warehouse to four different stores. The costs of shipping per unit to each store are as follows: Store 1 - $5, Store 2 - $3, Store 3 - $4, and Store 4 - $7. The warehouse has 300 units of the product available for shipping. What is the optimal allocation of units to each store to minimize the total shipping cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total shipping cost, the company should allocate the units to the stores with the lowest shipping costs first. In this case, the order of priority would be Store 2, Store 3, Store 1, and Store 4.\n\nHowever, we do not have information about the demand or maximum capacity of each store. Assuming that each store can accept any number of units, the optimal allocation would be to send all 300 units to Store 2, as it has the lowest shipping cost per unit.\n\nIn this scenario, the total shipping cost would be:\n\n300 units * $3/unit = $900\n\nIf there are specific demands or maximum capacities for each store, the allocation would need to be adjusted accordingly."
