    "message_1": "Suppose we want to encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using a Feistel Cipher with a block size of 16 bits and 3 rounds of encryption. The key used for encryption is 01101011. What will be the ciphertext generated by the Feistel Cipher for this message?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of the Feistel Cipher algorithm. Since the block size is 16 bits, we need to represent the message \"HELLO\" in 16-bit binary format. We can do this by converting each character to its 8-bit ASCII binary representation and then combining them into 16-bit blocks.\n\nH -> 01001000\nE -> 01000101\nL -> 01001100\nL -> 01001100\nO -> 01001111\n\nNow, we have two 16-bit blocks: 01001000 01000101 (HE) and 01001100 01001111 (LO).\n\nNext, we need to define the key schedule for the 3 rounds of encryption. Since the key is 01101011, we can use the same key for all 3 rounds.\n\nNow, let's perform the Feistel Cipher algorithm for each 16-bit block:\n\n1. Block 1 (HE):\n   - Round 1: L1 = 01001000, R1 = 01000101 XOR F(01001000, 01101011)\n   - Round 2: L2 = R1, R2 = L1 XOR F(R1, 01101011)\n   - Round 3: L3 = R2, R3 = L2 XOR F(R2, 01101011)\n   - Final output: R3L3\n\n2. Block 2 (LO):\n   - Round 1: L1 = 01001100, R1 = 01001111 XOR F(01001100, 01101011)\n   - Round 2: L2 = R1, R2 = L1 XOR F(R1, 01101011)\n   - Round 3: L3 = R2, R3 = L2 XOR F(R2, 01101011)\n   - Final output: R3L3\n\nNote that the F function is not specified in the problem, so we cannot compute the exact ciphertext. The Feistel Cipher algorithm depends on the specific F function used. If you provide the F function, we can compute the ciphertext for the given message \"HELLO\"."
