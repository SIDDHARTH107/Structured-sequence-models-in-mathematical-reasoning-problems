    "message_1": "A message of binary length 64 bits is encrypted using a Feistel cipher structure with 16 rounds. Each round uses a key of length 48 bits. What is the total size of the key that is required to encrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher structure, a key is used for each round of encryption. Since there are 16 rounds and each round uses a key of length 48 bits, the total size of the key required to encrypt the message can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal key size = (Number of rounds) × (Key length per round)\nTotal key size = 16 × 48\nTotal key size = 768 bits\n\nSo, the total size of the key required to encrypt the message is 768 bits."
