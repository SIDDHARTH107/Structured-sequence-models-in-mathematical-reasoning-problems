    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A△B and B△A. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA△B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {4} = {2, 3, 5, 6}\nB△A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {3, 2, 4, 6, 5} - {4} = {2, 3, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A△B) and (B△A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A△B) x (B△A) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)}\n\nSince the Cartesian product is commutative, the Cartesian product of (B△A) and (A△B) is the same as the Cartesian product of (A△B) and (B△A).\n\n(B△A) x (A△B) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)}\n\nAs we can see, (A△B) x (B△A) = (B△A) x (A△B). Therefore, the Cartesian products are equal."
