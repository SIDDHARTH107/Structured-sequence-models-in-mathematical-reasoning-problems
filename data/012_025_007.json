    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph.\n\nWe can start at vertex A and try to visit each vertex:\n\n1. Start at A.\n2. Go to B (edge AB). Vertices visited: A, B.\n3. Go to D (edge BD). Vertices visited: A, B, D.\n4. Go to G (edge DG). Vertices visited: A, B, D, G.\n5. Go to H (edge GH). Vertices visited: A, B, D, G, H.\n6. Go to F (edge FH). Vertices visited: A, B, D, G, H, F.\n7. Go to C (edge CF). Vertices visited: A, B, D, G, H, F, C.\n8. Go to E (edge BE). Vertices visited: A, B, D, G, H, F, C, E.\n\nNow we have visited all vertices, and we can return to vertex A using edge AE to complete the Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nThe Hamiltonian cycle in this graph is: A -> B -> D -> G -> H -> F -> C -> E -> A."
