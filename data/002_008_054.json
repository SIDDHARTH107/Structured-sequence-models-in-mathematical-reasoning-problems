    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 5 cm. Find the volume of the cone accurate to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * (5²) * 8\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 25 * 8\n\nVolume = 3.14159 * (25/3) * 8\n\nVolume = 3.14159 * 66.66667\n\nVolume = 209.43951 cm³\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the volume of the cone is approximately 209.44 cm³."
