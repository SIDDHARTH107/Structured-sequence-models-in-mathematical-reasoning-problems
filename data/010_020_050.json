    "message_1": "Suppose we have three knots in space, and we want to calculate the Floer homology of their connected sum. Let K1, K2, and K3 be the knots with knot energies E(K1) = 3, E(K2) = 4, and E(K3) = 5. Determine the knot energy E(K) of their connected sum K = (K1 # K2 # K3).",
    "message_2": "In knot theory, the connected sum of knots is an operation that combines two or more knots into a single knot. The knot energy of the connected sum of knots is not simply the sum of the individual knot energies. However, we can use the following property to determine the knot energy of the connected sum:\n\nProperty: If K1 and K2 are knots, then E(K1 # K2) ≤ E(K1) + E(K2).\n\nUsing this property, we can find an upper bound for the knot energy of the connected sum K = (K1 # K2 # K3):\n\nE(K) = E(K1 # K2 # K3) ≤ E(K1) + E(K2) + E(K3) = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.\n\nSo, the knot energy E(K) of the connected sum K = (K1 # K2 # K3) is at most 12. However, without more information about the specific knots K1, K2, and K3, we cannot determine the exact value of E(K)."
