    "message_2": "Let $f(z)$ be an entire function satisfying the given conditions. We will use the fact that an entire function can be represented by its Taylor series expansion around $z=0$. Let's write the Taylor series expansion of $f(z)$ as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$$\n\nwhere $a_n$ are complex coefficients. Since $f(0) = 1$, we have:\n\n$$1 = f(0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n \\cdot 0^n = a_0$$\n\nNow, we are given that $f(1) = i$. Substituting $z=1$ in the Taylor series expansion, we get:\n\n$$i = f(1) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n \\cdot 1^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n$$\n\nWe already know that $a_0 = 1$. So, we have:\n\n$$i = 1 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n$$\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(z) = f(z) - (1 - iz)$. This function is also entire, as it is the difference of two entire functions. Moreover, we have:\n\n$$g(0) = f(0) - (1 - i\\cdot 0) = 1 - 1 = 0$$\n$$g(1) = f(1) - (1 - i\\cdot 1) = i - (1 - i) = 0$$\n\nSince $g(z)$ is an entire function with at least two distinct zeros, by the Identity Theorem, $g(z)$ must be identically zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = 1 - iz$$\n\nThis is the unique entire function satisfying the given conditions."
