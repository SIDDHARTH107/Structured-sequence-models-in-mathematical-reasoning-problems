    "message_1": "Let X be a non-empty set and let τ = {∅, X} be the trivial topology on X. Determine whether the set S = {x} is open or closed in the topological space (X, τ), where x ∈ X.",
    "message_2": "In the trivial topology τ = {∅, X}, a set is considered open if it is either the empty set or the entire set X. The set S = {x} is neither the empty set nor the entire set X, so it is not open in the topological space (X, τ).\n\nA set is considered closed if its complement is open. The complement of S = {x} is X - {x}, which is the set of all elements in X except for x. If X has more than one element, then X - {x} is neither the empty set nor the entire set X, so it is not open, and therefore S = {x} is not closed.\n\nHowever, if X has exactly one element, i.e., X = {x}, then X - {x} = ∅, which is open in the trivial topology. In this case, S = {x} is closed.\n\nIn summary, the set S = {x} is neither open nor closed in the topological space (X, τ) when X has more than one element, but it is closed when X has exactly one element."
