    "message_2": "To determine the probability that at least one server fails within a month, we can first find the probability that none of the servers fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single server does not fail within a month is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nSince the servers' failures are independent events, the probability that all 10 servers do not fail within a month is (0.98)^10 ≈ 0.817.\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one server fails within a month, we subtract the probability that none of them fail from 1:\n\n1 - 0.817 ≈ 0.183.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one server fails within a month is approximately 18.3%."
