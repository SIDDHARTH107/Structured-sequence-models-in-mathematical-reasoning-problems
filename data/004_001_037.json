    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 9, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, 2x^3:\nn = 3, so the derivative is 3 * 2x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n\nFor the second term, -5x^2:\nn = 2, so the derivative is 2 * -5x^(2-1) = -10x.\n\nFor the third term, 4x:\nn = 1, so the derivative is 1 * 4x^(1-1) = 4.\n\nFor the fourth term, -9:\nSince it is a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we add up the derivatives of each term to get the derivative of the whole function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 4"
