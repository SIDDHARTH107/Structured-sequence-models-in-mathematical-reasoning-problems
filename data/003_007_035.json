    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C respectively. In this case, we have a = 12, b = 15, and c = 18. We want to find the smallest angle, which will be opposite the shortest side. Since a is the shortest side, we want to find angle A.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc * cos(A)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n12^2 = 15^2 + 18^2 - 2(15)(18) * cos(A)\n\n144 = 225 + 324 - 540 * cos(A)\n\nNow, let's solve for cos(A):\n\n144 - 225 - 324 = -540 * cos(A)\n\n-405 = -540 * cos(A)\n\ncos(A) = 405/540\n\nNow, to find the angle A, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nA = arccos(405/540)\n\nA ≈ 41.41°\n\nSo, the measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 41.41°."
