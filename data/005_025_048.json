    "message_1": "A company claims that their new product increases productivity by 25%. A sample of 50 employees were selected and their productivity was measured before and after using the new product. The data showed that the average productivity increased by 20%. \n\nUsing a significance level of 0.05, can the company's claim of a 25% increase in productivity be supported by the sample data?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the company's claim of a 25% increase in productivity can be supported by the sample data, we will perform a hypothesis test. \n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).\nH0: The average increase in productivity is 25% (μ = 0.25).\nH1: The average increase in productivity is not 25% (μ ≠ 0.25).\n\nStep 2: Determine the appropriate test statistic.\nSince we have a sample and we do not know the population standard deviation, we will use a t-test.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nWe are given the following information:\n- Sample size (n) = 50\n- Sample mean (x̄) = 0.20\n- Claimed population mean (μ) = 0.25\n\nWe need to calculate the sample standard deviation (s) from the data. However, since it is not provided, we will assume that it is given or can be calculated from the data.\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value.\nUsing a significance level (α) of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 49, we can find the critical value from the t-distribution table. For a two-tailed test, the critical values are -2.0096 and 2.0096.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value and make a decision.\nIf the calculated test statistic falls within the critical values, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If it falls outside the critical values, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nSince we do not have the sample standard deviation, we cannot calculate the exact test statistic. However, if it were calculated and fell within the critical values, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the company's claim of a 25% increase in productivity could not be disproven by the sample data. If the test statistic fell outside the critical values, we would reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the sample data does not support the company's claim of a 25% increase in productivity.\n\nIn conclusion, without the sample standard deviation, we cannot determine whether the company's claim of a 25% increase in productivity can be supported by the sample data."
