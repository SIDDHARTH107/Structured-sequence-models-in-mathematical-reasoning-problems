    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow of water that can be transported from the source to the destination, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find the augmenting paths and their bottleneck capacities, then update the residual capacities of the pipes accordingly.\n\n1. Start with an initial flow of 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path from the source to the destination.\n\n   One possible path is (1) -> (2) -> (4) -> (5). The bottleneck capacity of this path is the minimum capacity along the path, which is min(10, 6) = 6.\n\n3. Update the flow by the bottleneck capacity (6 liters per minute) and update the residual capacities of the pipes.\n\n   The updated capacities are:\n\n   ```\n                 4\n       (1)--------->(2)\n       / | \\         |\n      /  |  \\ 8      |\n    5/   2|   \\     |\n    /     |    \\    |\n  (3)     |3    \\(4) 0\n    \\     |     /    |\n    7\\   4|   /     |\n      \\  |  / 9     |\n       \\ | /        |\n        (5)<--------'\n               12\n   ```\n\n4.
