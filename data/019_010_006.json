    "message_2": "To solve the linear logic equation, we will use the properties of negation and tensor product.\n\nGiven the equation: !(x1 + x2) ⊗ x3 = x4\n\nFirst, we apply the negation to the sum of x1 and x2:\n\n!x1 ⊗ !x2\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\n(!x1 ⊗ !x2) ⊗ x3 = x4\n\nNext, we apply the associativity property of the tensor product:\n\n!x1 ⊗ (!x2 ⊗ x3) = x4\n\nThis is the simplified form of the given linear logic equation. However, without any specific values for the propositional variables x1, x2, x3, and x4, we cannot determine a unique solution."
