    "message_2": "Since H^1(X; Z) has order 3, it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_3. Recall that there is a correspondence between connected covering spaces of X and subgroups of the fundamental group π_1(X). Moreover, the first cohomology group H^1(X; Z) is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group, i.e., H^1(X; Z) ≅ π_1(X)/[π_1(X), π_1(X)], where [π_1(X), π_1(X)] is the commutator subgroup of π_1(X).\n\nNow, we want to find the number of connected covering spaces corresponding to subgroups of H^1(X; Z). Since H^1(X; Z) is isomorphic to Z_3, it has two non-trivial subgroups: the trivial subgroup {0} and the whole group Z_3 itself.\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {0} corresponds to the universal cover of X, which is a connected covering space.\n\n2. The whole group Z_3 corresponds to the regular 3-sheeted covering space of X, which is also connected.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 connected covering spaces of X, up to isomorphism, that correspond to subgroups of H^1(X; Z)."
