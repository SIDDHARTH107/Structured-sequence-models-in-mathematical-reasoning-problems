    "message_1": "Consider a wave that propagates through a medium with a speed of 30 m/s, with an initial displacement of 0.1 m at x = 0 and an initial velocity of 0 m/s. The wave equation is described as y(x,t) = 0.1 sin(4πt - 4πx). Find the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and period of this wave.",
    "message_2": "The given wave equation is y(x,t) = 0.1 sin(4πt - 4πx). This equation is in the form of a sinusoidal wave, which can be written as y(x,t) = A sin(ωt - kx), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, k is the wave number, and x and t are the position and time variables, respectively.\n\n1. Amplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. In the given equation, the amplitude is 0.1 m.\n\n2. Wavelength (λ):\nThe wave number (k) is related to the wavelength (λ) by the equation k = 2π/λ. From the given wave equation, we can see that k = 4π. Therefore, we can find the wavelength as follows:\n\nλ = 2π/k = 2π/(4π) = 1/2 m\n\nThe wavelength of the wave is 0.5 m.\n\n3. Frequency (f) and Angular Frequency (ω):\nThe angular frequency (ω) is related to the frequency (f) by the equation ω = 2πf. From the given wave equation, we can see that ω = 4π. Therefore, we can find the frequency as follows:\n\nf = ω/(2π) = (4π)/(2π) = 2 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the wave is 2 Hz.\n\n4. Period (T):\nThe period (T) is the time it takes for one complete cycle of the wave to pass a given point. It is the reciprocal of the frequency:\n\nT = 1/f = 1/2 = 0.5 s\n\nThe period of the wave is 0.5 seconds.\n\nIn summary, the wave has an amplitude of 0.1 m, a wavelength of 0.5 m, a frequency of 2 Hz, and a period of 0.5 seconds."
