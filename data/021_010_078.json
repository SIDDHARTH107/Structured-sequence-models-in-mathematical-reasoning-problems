    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 3 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nStep 1: Find the derivative of the function.\nf'(x) = 2x + 2\n\nStep 2: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n2x + 2 = 0\n2x = -2\nx = -1\n\nThere is only one critical point, x = -1. Since the function is a parabola with a positive leading coefficient, this critical point corresponds to a minimum value.\n\nStep 3: Use Newton's method to find the minimum value.\nNewton's method formula: x_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nIn this case, we need to find the second derivative of the function.\nf''(x) = 2 (since the second derivative is a constant, it will not change during the iterations)\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method. We will start with an initial guess, x_0. Let's choose x_0 = 0.\n\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0)\nx_1 = 0 - (2*0 + 2) / 2\nx_1 = -1\n\nSince x_1 = -1, which is the critical point we found earlier, there is no need to perform further iterations. Newton's method has converged to the minimum point.\n\nStep 4: Find the minimum value of the function.\nf(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 3\nf(-1) = 1 - 2 - 3\nf(-1) = -4\n\nThe minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 3 is -4, which occurs at x = -1."
