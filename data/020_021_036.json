    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: A and B. The production of product A requires 2 hours of assembly, 1 hour of finishing and 3 hours of packaging. The production of product B requires 3 hours of assembly, 2 hours of finishing, and 1 hour of packaging. The company has 10 hours of assembly, 6 hours of finishing, and 12 hours of packaging available per day. The profit from selling a unit of product A is $50 and the profit from selling a unit of product B is $60. How many units of each product should the company produce per day to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced per day.\n\nThe constraints for the available hours of assembly, finishing, and packaging are as follows:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 10 (assembly)\nx + 2y ≤ 6 (finishing)\n3x + y ≤ 12 (packaging)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 50x + 60y\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 10\ny ≤ (10 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 6\ny ≤ (6 - x) / 2\n\n3. 3x + y ≤ 12\ny ≤ 12 - 3x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 3), (2, 2), and (4, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 50(0) + 60(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 3) = 50(0) + 60(3) = $180\n3. P(2, 2) = 50(2) + 60(2) = $220\n4. P(4, 0) = 50(4) + 60(0) = $200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (2, 2), where the company produces 2 units of product A and 2 units of product B per day, resulting in a profit of $220."
