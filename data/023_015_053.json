    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform of the given signal f(t) = 5sin(2πt/6) + 2cos(2πt/3), we can use the following definitions:\n\nFourier Transform of sin(ωt) = (1/2j) [δ(ω - ω₀) - δ(ω + ω₀)]\nFourier Transform of cos(ωt) = (1/2) [δ(ω - ω₀) + δ(ω + ω₀)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function, ω is the angular frequency, and ω₀ is the angular frequency of the sinusoidal function.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier Transform of each term in the given signal:\n\n1. For the first term, 5sin(2πt/6):\nω₁ = 2π/6 = π/3\nFourier Transform of 5sin(π/3 t) = (5/2j) [δ(ω - π/3) - δ(ω + π/3)]\n\n2. For the second term, 2cos(2πt/3):\nω₂ = 2π/3\nFourier Transform of 2cos(2π/3 t) = (2/2) [δ(ω - 2π/3) + δ(ω + 2π/3)] = [δ(ω - 2π/3) + δ(ω + 2π/3)]\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier Transforms of both terms to find the Fourier Transform of the given signal:\n\nF(ω) = (5/2j) [δ(ω - π/3) - δ(ω + π/3)] + [δ(ω - 2π/3) + δ(ω + 2π/3)]\n\nThe frequencies present in the signal can be found by looking at the Dirac delta functions in the Fourier Transform:\n\n1. ω = π/3 (from the first term)\n2. ω = -π/3 (from the first term)\n3. ω = 2π/3 (from the second term)\n4. ω = -2π/3 (from the second term)\n\nSo, the frequencies present in the signal are π/3, -π/3, 2π/3, and -2π/3."
