    "message_1": "Suppose a math student collected data on the number of hours they studied for their last three exams, which came out to be 6 hours, 8 hours, and 10 hours. Find the outlier in the dataset using the interquartile range (IQR) method.",
    "message_2": "To find the outlier using the interquartile range (IQR) method, we first need to find the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2, also known as the median), and the third quartile (Q3). However, since there are only three data points in this dataset, it is not possible to calculate the IQR and use it to find an outlier.\n\nIn general, the IQR method is more suitable for larger datasets. For this small dataset, we can simply observe that there is no significant difference between the three data points (6, 8, and 10 hours), and therefore, there is no outlier."
