    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is independent of the initial interval length. The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each interval. At each step, the remaining intervals are scaled by a factor of 1/3, and the number of intervals increases by a factor of 2.\n\nTo find the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor set, N = 2 (since we have two intervals after the first step) and S = 3 (since each interval is 1/3 of the previous interval).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is approximately 0.6309, regardless of the initial interval length."
