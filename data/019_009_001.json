Assume Q (assumption for nested conditional proof)\n3. Reiterate P (from step 1)\n4. Discharge the assumption in step 2, concluding Q -> P (conditional proof)\n5. Discharge the assumption in step 1, concluding P -> (Q -> P) (conditional proof)\n\nSo, the proof of P -> (Q -> P) in intuitionistic logic is as follows:\n\n1. P (Assumption)\n2. |_ Q (Assumption)\n3. |  P (Reiteration, 1)\n4. Q -> P (Conditional Proof, 2-3)\n5. P -> (Q -> P) (Conditional Proof, 1-4)"
