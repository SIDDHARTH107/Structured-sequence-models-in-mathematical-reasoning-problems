    "message_2": "Since the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 1/4, the scalar curvature R, which is twice the Gaussian curvature in a two-dimensional surface, is also constant and equal to R = 2K = 1/2.\n\nTo compute the integral of the scalar curvature over S, we need to integrate R over the surface area A of S:\n\n∫∫_S R dA = ∫∫_S (1/2) dA = (1/2) ∫∫_S dA = (1/2)A.\n\nNow, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the total Gaussian curvature of a surface S is related to its Euler characteristic χ(S) by the following formula:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S).\n\nSince K = 1/4, we have:\n\n∫∫_S (1/4) dA = 2πχ(S).\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the integral of the scalar curvature over S:\n\n(1/2)A = 2πχ(S).\n\nFrom this equation, we can find the total Gaussian curvature of S:\n\nA = 4πχ(S).\n\nThus, the total Gaussian curvature of S is 4π times its Euler characteristic."
