Alice chooses the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the prime field F11, with generator point P(3,8). Alice's private key is 5, and Bob's private key is 7. Determine the shared secret point Q and its coordinates.",
    "message_2": "To determine the shared secret point Q and its coordinates, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key A = aP, where a is her private key and P is the generator point.\n2. Bob computes his public key B = bP, where b is his private key and P is the generator point.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret point Q = aB.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret point Q = bA.\n\nSince both Alice and Bob will arrive at the same point Q, we only need to compute one of these.\n\nFirst, let's compute Alice's public key A = 5P. We will use the double-and-add method for scalar multiplication.\n\n5P = 2P + 3P\n\nTo compute 2P, we need to find the tangent line at point P(3,8) and find the intersection with the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over F11.\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at P is given by the formula:\n\nm = (3 * x^2 + a) / (2 * y) mod p\n\nwhere a is the coefficient of the x term in the elliptic curve equation, and p is the prime number (11 in this case).\n\nm = (3 * (3^2) + 2) / (2 * 8) mod 11\nm = (27 + 2) / 16 mod 11\nm = 29 / 16 mod 11\nm = 29 * 16^(-1) mod 11\n\nWe need to find the modular inverse of 16 in F11. Since 11 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n16^(11-2) = 16^9 mod 11\n\n16^9 mod 11 = 2 (using a calculator or repeated squaring)\n\nNow, we can compute the slope:\n\nm = 29 * 2 mod 11\nm = 58 mod 11\nm = 3\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of 2P using the following formulas:\n\nx(2P) = (m^2 - 2 * x) mod p\ny(2P) = (m * (x - x(2P)) - y) mod p\n\nx(2P) = (3^2 - 2 * 3) mod 11\nx(2P) = (9 - 6) mod 11\nx(2P) = 3 mod 11\nx(2P) = 3\n\ny(2P) = (3 * (3 - 3) - 8) mod 11\ny(2P) = (-8) mod 11\ny(2P) = 3\n\nSo, 2P = (3, 3).\n\nNow, we need to compute 3P = P + 2P. The slope of the line through P and 2P is given by:\n\nm = (y(2P) - y) / (x(2P) - x) mod p\n\nm = (3 - 8) / (3 - 3) mod 11\nm = (-5) / 0 mod 11\n\nWe need to find the modular inverse of 0 in F11, which does not exist. This means that P and 2P are vertical, and their sum is the point at infinity, which is the identity element for the elliptic curve group. Therefore, 3P = P.\n\nNow, we can compute Alice's public key A = 5P = 2P + 3P = 2P + P = (3, 3) + (3, 8).\n\nFinally, we can compute the shared secret point Q = aB = 5(7P) = 35P.\n\nSince 35P = 2P + 33P = 2P + 3P = (3, 3) + (3, 8), we have already computed this sum, and the shared secret point Q is the point at infinity.\n\nSo, the shared secret point Q is the point at infinity, which does not have specific coordinates."
