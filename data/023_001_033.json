    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following equation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_0 = (1 / π) * [∫[-π, 0] 1 dx + ∫[0, π] 0 dx]\na_0 = (1 / π) * [x | -π to 0] = 1 / 2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\na_n = (1 / π) * [∫[-π, 0] 1 * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] 0 * cos(n * x) dx]\na_n = (1 / π) * [sin(n * x) / n | -π to 0] = 0\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\nb_n = (1 / π) * [∫[-π, 0] 1 * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] 0 * sin(n * x) dx]\nb_n = (1 / π) * [-cos(n * x) / n | -π to 0] = (1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π)\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ [(1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π) * sin(n * x)]\n\nNow, we want to extend the function to a period of 2L with L = 2π. Since the original function has a period of 2π, it is already periodic with a period of 2L.\n\nFinally, let's find the value of the function at x = π/3:\n\nf(π/3) = 1/2 + Σ [(1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π) * sin(n * π/3)]\n\nThis is an infinite series, but we can approximate the value by taking the first few terms:\n\nf(π/3) ≈ 1/2 + (1 / π) * [sin(π/3) + (1/3) * sin(3 * π/3) + (1/5) * sin(5 * π/3) + ...]\n\nf(π/3) ≈ 1/2 + (1 / π) * [sin(π/3)] ≈ 1/2 + (1 / π) * [√3 / 2] ≈ 0.8183\n\nSo, the approximate value of the function at x = π/3 is 0.8183."
