    "message_2": "To find out how many seats party C has, we need to subtract the total number of seats held by parties A and B from the total number of seats in the parliament.\n\nTotal seats in parliament = 40\nSeats held by party A = 12\nSeats held by party B = 15\n\nSeats held by party C = Total seats in parliament - (Seats held by party A + Seats held by party B)\nSeats held by party C = 40 - (12 + 15)\nSeats held by party C = 40 - 27\nSeats held by party C = 13\n\nParty C has 13 seats in the parliament."
