    "message_2": "To form a batting lineup with 9 players out of a team of 15 players, we can use the concept of permutations. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order.\n\nIn this case, we have 15 players to choose from for the first position in the lineup, 14 players left for the second position, 13 players for the third position, and so on, until we have 7 players left for the ninth position.\n\nThe number of different batting lineups can be calculated using the formula for permutations:\n\nn! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of players (15 in this case) and r is the number of players in the lineup (9 in this case).\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\n15! / (15 - 9)!\n\n15! / 6!\n\n= (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\n= (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / 1\n\n= 1,816,214,400 / 720\n\n= 2,520,300\n\nSo, there are 2,520,300 different batting lineups that can be formed with 9 players out of a team of 15 players."
