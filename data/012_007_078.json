    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the image you are referring to. However, I can help you solve the problem if you provide the capacities of the edges and their connections between the nodes. Please provide the information in the following format:\n\nEdge 1: Node A to Node B, Capacity X\nEdge 2: Node A to Node C, Capacity Y\n..."
