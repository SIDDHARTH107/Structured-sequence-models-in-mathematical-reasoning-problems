    "message_1": "Consider a type theory that has only three types: Bool, Nat, and List. Let T be the type (Bool -> Nat) -> List, and let t be a term of that type. Suppose that t evaluates to a list whose length is 10. How many possible terms of type Bool -> Nat could t contain?",
    "message_2": "The type T is a function type that takes a function of type Bool -> Nat as input and returns a List as output. Since t is a term of type T, it is a function that takes a function of type Bool -> Nat as input and returns a list of length 10.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of possible terms of type Bool -> Nat that t could contain. This is a bit ambiguous, as t itself is not of type Bool -> Nat, but rather takes a function of that type as input.\n\nIf we interpret the question as asking for the number of possible functions of type Bool -> Nat that can be used as input to t, we can proceed as follows:\n\nA function of type Bool -> Nat takes a boolean value (either True or False) as input and returns a natural number as output. There are two possible inputs (True and False), and each input can be mapped to any natural number. Since there are infinitely many natural numbers, there are infinitely many possible functions of type Bool -> Nat that can be used as input to t."
