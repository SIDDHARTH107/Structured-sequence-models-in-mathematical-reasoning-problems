    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order p^2, where p is prime, is either isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p^2 or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n2. A group of order 2n, where n is odd, has a normal subgroup of order n.\n\nLet G be a group with exactly 8 elements. Since 8 = 2^3, we know that G is a p-group, where p = 2. We will consider the cases based on the number of elements of order 2 in G.\n\nCase 1: G has exactly one element of order 2.\nIn this case, G must be a cyclic group of order 8, which is isomorphic to C8.\n\nCase 2: G has more than one element of order 2.\nLet x be an element of order 2 in G. Since the order of x is 2, the order of the subgroup generated by x, denoted by ⟨x⟩, is also 2. By fact 2, ⟨x⟩ is a normal subgroup of G. Let y be an element in G not in ⟨x⟩. We can form the set S = {e, x, y, xy, x^2y, x^3y, x^4y, x^5y}, where e is the identity element. Since G has 8 elements, S must be equal to G.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible orders of y.\n\nCase 2.1: The order of y is 2.\nIn this case, G has at least three elements of order 2: x, y, and xy. Since G is a group of order 8, it must have a subgroup of order 4. Let H be such a subgroup. Since H has order 4, it must have at least one element of order 4. Let z be an element of order 4 in H. Then, G is generated by x and z, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n\nCase 2.2: The order of y is 4.\nIn this case, G is generated by x and y. We can compute the product of x and y as follows:\n\n(xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = y^2, since x and y commute.\n(xy)^4 = (xy)^2(xy)^2 = y^2y^2 = y^4 = e, since y has order 4.\n\nThus, xy has order 4. Since G is generated by x and y, G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group has exactly 8 elements, then it is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, quaternion group Q8, or dihedral group D4."
