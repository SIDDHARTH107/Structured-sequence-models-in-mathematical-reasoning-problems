    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 ≤ 13, we need to isolate x:\n\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides:\n2x ≤ 10\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\nx ≤ 5\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x ≤ 5.\n\nTo graph the solution on the number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from -2 to 7 (or any range that includes 5).\n2. Place a closed circle on 5, since the inequality includes \"equal to\" (≤).\n3. Shade the line to the left of 5, indicating that all values less than or equal to 5 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph should look like this:\n\n```\n<----[5---->\n-2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7\n```\n\nThe closed circle on 5 and the shaded line to the left represent the solution x ≤ 5."
