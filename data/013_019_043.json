    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players, Player A and Player B, who want to split a sum of $100. They can communicate with each other through a messaging system, but their messages are not binding (i.e. they can lie). If they both agree on a split, the money will be divided accordingly. If they cannot agree, the money will be lost. However, if one player offers the other player a deal and the other player accepts it, the money will be split according to that deal. What is the optimal strategy for each player?",
    "message_2": "The optimal strategy for each player in this situation is to use a combination of negotiation and credible threats. Since the messages are not binding, players need to convince the other player that they will follow through with their proposed split, and that rejecting the offer would lead to a worse outcome for both.\n\n1. Player A should start by proposing a split that favors them, for example, $60 for Player A and $40 for Player B. This gives Player A an advantage, but still offers Player B a reasonable share of the money.\n\n2. Player A should then communicate their willingness to accept a smaller share if Player B refuses the initial offer, but also emphasize that they are willing to let the money be lost if an agreement cannot be reached. This creates a credible threat that incentivizes Player B to accept the offer.\n\n3. Player B should counter with a more favorable split for themselves, such as $50 for Player A and $50 for Player B. They should also emphasize their willingness to let the money be lost if an agreement cannot be reached, creating a credible threat of their own.\n\n4. Both players should continue negotiating, making small concessions while maintaining their credible threats. This will eventually lead to a mutually acceptable split, as both players have an incentive to avoid losing the money.\n\nThe key to this strategy is for both players to be convincing in their threats and to be willing to make concessions to reach an agreement. By doing so, they can maximize their share of the money while minimizing the risk of losing it all."
