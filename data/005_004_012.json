Use alpha level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform a one-way ANOVA, we first need to calculate the means and variances for each class, as well as the overall mean.\n\nClass 1: Mean (M1) = (80+85+75+90+95)/5 = 85\nClass 2: Mean (M2) = (90+75+70+80+85)/5 = 80\nClass 3: Mean (M3) = (95+90+85+80+75)/5 = 85\n\nOverall Mean (M) = (M1 + M2 + M3)/3 = (85+80+85)/3 = 83.33\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and total sum of squares (SST).\n\nSSB = Σ(n_i * (M_i - M)^2) = 5*((85-83.33)^2 + (80-83.33)^2 + (85-83.33)^2) = 166.67\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - M_i)^2 = (5+5+5)*[(80-85)^2 + (85-85)^2 + (75-85)^2 + (90-85)^2 + (95-85)^2 + (90-80)^2 + (75-80)^2 + (70-80)^2 + (80-80)^2 + (85-80)^2 + (95-85)^2 + (90-85)^2 + (85-85)^2 + (80-85)^2 + (75-85)^2] = 750\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 166.67 + 750 = 916.67\n\nNow we calculate the mean squares between groups (MSB) and mean squares within groups (MSW).\n\nMSB = SSB/(k-1) = 166.67/(3-1) = 83.33\nMSW = SSW/(N-k) = 750/(15-3) = 62.5\n\nNext, we calculate the F-statistic.\n\nF = MSB/MSW = 83.33/62.5 = 1.333\n\nNow we need to find the critical F-value for an alpha level of 0.05. We use the F-distribution table with degrees of freedom for between groups (k-1) = 2 and within groups (N-k) = 12. The critical F-value is 3.89.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (1.333) is less than the critical F-value (3.89), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no significant difference in the means of test scores among the three classes at an alpha level of 0.05."
