    "message_1": "Consider the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, where $p = 19$. Let $P = (5, 2)$ and $Q = (8,11)$ be points on $E$.\n\nWhat is the result of adding $P$ and $Q$ on the elliptic curve $E$?",
    "message_2": "To add points $P$ and $Q$ on the elliptic curve $E$, we need to find the point $R = P + Q$. We can do this by finding the slope of the line through $P$ and $Q$ and then using the formulas for adding points on an elliptic curve.\n\nThe slope $m$ of the line through $P$ and $Q$ is given by:\n\n$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, where $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$.\n\nHowever, since we are working in the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, we need to compute the inverse of $(x_2 - x_1)$ modulo $p$. \n\nSo, $m = \\frac{11 - 2}{8 - 5} \\pmod{19} = \\frac{9}{3} \\pmod{19} = 3$.\n\nNow we can find the coordinates of the point $R = (x_3, y_3)$ using the following formulas:\n\n$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\pmod{19} = 3^2 - 5 - 8 \\pmod{19} = 9 - 13 \\pmod{19} = -4 \\pmod{19} = 15$.\n\n$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{19} = 3(5 - 15) - 2 \\pmod{19} = 3(-10) - 2 \\pmod{19} = -32 \\pmod{19} = 6$.\n\nSo, the result of adding $P$ and $Q$ on the elliptic curve $E$ is the point $R = (15, 6)$."
