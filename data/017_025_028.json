    "message_2": "There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120. Their structures can be expressed in terms of their corresponding isomorphisms as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group: Z_120\nThis group is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 120, and it has the structure Z_120 ≅ Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_5.\n\n2. Dihedral group: D_60\nThis group is the group of symmetries of a regular 60-gon, including rotations and reflections. It has the structure D_60 ≅ Z_60 ⋊ Z_2.\n\n3. Alternating group: A_5\nThis group is the group of even permutations of 5 elements, and it is a simple group. It has the structure A_5 ≅ Z_2 × Z_3 ⋊ Z_5.\n\n4. Symmetric group: S_5\nThis group is the group of all permutations of 5 elements. It has the structure S_5 ≅ A_5 ⋊ Z_2.\n\n5. Direct product of groups: Z_4 × S_3\nThis group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 4 and the symmetric group of order 6. It has the structure Z_4 × S_3 ≅ (Z_2 × Z_2) × (Z_3 ⋊ Z_2).\n\nThese are the 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120, along with their structures expressed in terms of their corresponding isomorphisms."
