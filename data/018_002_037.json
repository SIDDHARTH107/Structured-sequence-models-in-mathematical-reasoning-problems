Therefore, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nC = {3, 5}\n\nNow, we need to show that C is a subset of A and B. A set C is a subset of set A if every element of C is also an element of A. Similarly, a set C is a subset of set B if every element of C is also an element of B.\n\nLet's check if every element of C is in A:\n\nC = {3, 5}\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\nBoth 3 and 5 are elements of A, so C is a subset of A.\n\nNow let's check if every element of C is in B:\n\nC = {3, 5}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nBoth 3 and 5 are elements of B, so C is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that C is a subset of both A and B."
