At time t=0, it is given an initial velocity of 2m/s and at the same time, a wave is propagated along the string by the motion of the ends. If the wave is described by the function y(x,t) = 0.05cos(5x - 20t), where x is in meters and t is in seconds, determine:\n\na) The wavelength and frequency of the wave\nb) The maximum speed of any element of the string\nc) The maximum amplitude of the wave\nd) The time taken for the wave to travel a distance of one wavelength.",
    "message_2": "a) To find the wavelength and frequency of the wave, we need to analyze the wave function y(x,t) = 0.05cos(5x - 20t). The general form of a wave function is y(x,t) = Acos(kx - ωt), where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nIn our case, k = 5 and ω = 20. The wavelength (λ) and wave number (k) are related by the equation k = 2π/λ. Solving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 2π/k = 2π/5 ≈ 1.256 meters\n\nThe angular frequency (ω) and frequency (f) are related by the equation ω = 2πf. Solving for f, we get:\n\nf = ω/2π = 20/2π ≈ 3.183 Hz\n\nSo, the wavelength is approximately 1.256 meters, and the frequency is approximately 3.183 Hz.\n\nb) The maximum speed of any element of the string can be found by taking the time derivative of the wave function:\n\ny(x,t) = 0.05cos(5x - 20t)\ndy/dt = -0.05 * 20 * sin(5x - 20t) = -sin(5x - 20t)\n\nThe maximum speed occurs when the sine function is at its maximum value of 1:\n\nMax speed = |-1 * 0.05 * 20| = 1 m/s\n\nc) The maximum amplitude of the wave is given by the coefficient of the cosine function in the wave equation:\n\nMax amplitude = 0.05 meters\n\nd) To find the time taken for the wave to travel a distance of one wavelength, we can use the formula:\n\nspeed = wavelength / time\n\nThe speed of the wave can be found using the formula v = ω/k:\n\nv = ω/k = 20/5 = 4 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the time taken for the wave to travel one wavelength:\n\ntime = wavelength / speed = 1.256 / 4 ≈ 0.314 seconds\n\nSo, the time taken for the wave to travel a distance of one wavelength is approximately 0.314 seconds."
