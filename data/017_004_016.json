    "message_2": "There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 25.\n\nThe order of a group is the number of its elements. A group of order 25 has 25 elements. Since 25 is a prime number squared (5^2), there are two possibilities for the structure of the group:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 25, denoted by C_25 or Z_25. This group has one element that generates the whole group, and its elements can be written as powers of the generator. It is abelian, meaning that the group operation is commutative.\n\n2. A non-cyclic group, which must be a direct product of two smaller cyclic groups. In this case, the only possibility is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted by C_5 Ã— C_5. This group is also abelian, but it is not cyclic because it does not have a single element that generates the whole group.\n\nThese are the only two non-isomorphic groups of order 25."
