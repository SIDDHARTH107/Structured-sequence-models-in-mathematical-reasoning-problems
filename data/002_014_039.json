    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, width of 4 cm, and height of 5 cm. What is the surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found using the formula for the area of a rectangle: length × width. In this case, the length is 6 cm and the width is 4 cm.\n\nArea of top and bottom faces = 6 cm × 4 cm = 24 cm²\n\nSince there are two faces (top and bottom), the total area for these faces is:\n\n2 × 24 cm² = 48 cm²\n\nNext, we find the area of the front and back faces. The dimensions of these faces are the width (4 cm) and the height (5 cm).\n\nArea of front and back faces = 4 cm × 5 cm = 20 cm²\n\nSince there are two faces (front and back), the total area for these faces is:\n\n2 × 20 cm² = 40 cm²\n\nFinally, we find the area of the left and right faces. The dimensions of these faces are the length (6 cm) and the height (5 cm).\n\nArea of left and right faces = 6 cm × 5 cm = 30 cm²\n\nSince there are two faces (left and right), the total area for these faces is:\n\n2 × 30 cm² = 60 cm²\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all the faces together to find the surface area of the rectangular prism:\n\n48 cm² (top and bottom) + 40 cm² (front and back) + 60 cm² (left and right) = 148 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 cm²."
