    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given periodic function f(x), we need to determine the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ, which are given by the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to L (L is half the period)\naₙ = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\nbₙ = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nIn this case, the period is 4, so L = 4/2 = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\na₀ = (1/2) * [∫(2 dx) from 0 to 2 + ∫(0 dx) from 2 to 4]\na₀ = (1/2) * [2x | from 0 to 2 + 0]\na₀ = (1/2) * [4 - 0]\na₀ = 2\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\naₙ = (2/2) * [∫(2 * cos(nπx/2) dx) from 0 to 2 + ∫(0 * cos(nπx/2) dx) from 2 to 4]\naₙ = ∫(cos(nπx/2) dx) from 0 to 2\naₙ = [(2/(nπ)) * sin(nπx/2)] from 0 to 2\naₙ = (2/(nπ)) * [sin(nπ) - sin(0)]\naₙ = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nFinally, let's find bₙ:\nbₙ = (2/2) * [∫(2 * sin(nπx/2) dx) from 0 to 2 + ∫(0 * sin(nπx/2) dx) from 2 to 4]\nbₙ = ∫(sin(nπx/2) dx) from 0 to 2\nbₙ = [(-2/(nπ)) * cos(nπx/2)] from 0 to 2\nbₙ = (-2/(nπ)) * [cos(nπ) - cos(0)]\n\nFor odd values of n, cos(nπ) = -1, and for even values of n, cos(nπ) = 1. Since the function is odd, we only need to consider odd values of n. So, we can rewrite bₙ as:\n\nbₙ = (-2/(nπ)) * [-2] for odd n\nbₙ = (4/(nπ)) for odd n\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ[(aₙ * cos(nπx/2)) + (bₙ * sin(nπx/2))] from n=1 to ∞\nf(x) = 2 + Σ[(0 * cos(nπx/2)) + ((4/(nπ)) * sin(nπx/2))] for odd n, from n=1 to ∞\nf(x) = 2 + Σ[(4/(nπ)) * sin(nπx/2)] for odd n, from n=1 to ∞\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given periodic function f(x)."
