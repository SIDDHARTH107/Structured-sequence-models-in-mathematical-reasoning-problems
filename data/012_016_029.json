    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial, T(x, y), of a graph G is a polynomial in two variables x and y that encodes various properties of the graph. It is defined as:\n\nT(G; x, y) = âˆ‘(r, k) a(r, k) * x^(r) * y^(k)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all subgraphs H of G, r is the number of connected components of H, k is the number of connected components of the complement of H, and a(r, k) is the number of subgraphs of G with r connected components and k connected components in the complement.\n\nFor a complete graph K_n, the Tutte polynomial can be computed using the following formula:\n\nT(K_n; x, y) = (x - 1)^(n-1) + (x - 1)^(n-2) * (y - 1)\n\nIn our case, we have a complete graph K_5, so n = 5. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nT(K_5; x, y) = (x - 1)^(5-1) + (x - 1)^(5-2) * (y - 1)\nT(K_5; x, y) = (x - 1)^4 + (x - 1)^3 * (y - 1)\n\nExpanding the polynomial, we get:\n\nT(K_5; x, y) = (x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) + (x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1) * (y - 1)\nT(K_5; x, y) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 + x^3y - 3x^2y + 3xy - y - x^3 + 3x^2 - 3x + 1\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nT(K_5; x, y) = x^4 - 3x^3y + 3xy - y + x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the complete graph K_5 is:\n\nT(K_5; x, y) = x^4 - 3x^3y + 3xy - y + x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x"
