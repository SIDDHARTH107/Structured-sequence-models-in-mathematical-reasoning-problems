    "message_2": "The union of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. \n\nGiven A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6}, we can find the union of set A and set B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the resulting set A ∪ B is a superset of both set A and set B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of A is also an element of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of B is also an element of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the resulting set A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is a superset of both set A and set B."
