    "message_2": "A generator of a group of prime order p (in this case, p = 17) is an element g in the group such that its powers generate all the other elements in the group. In other words, the set {g^1, g^2, ..., g^(p-1)} contains all the non-identity elements of the group.\n\nFor a group of prime order 17, we can consider the multiplicative group modulo 17, which consists of the integers {1, 2, ..., 16} under multiplication modulo 17. To find a generator, we need to find an element g such that g^k (mod 17) generates all the non-identity elements in the group.\n\nLet's test some elements:\n\n- For g = 2: 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 15, 2^6 = 13, 2^7 = 9, 2^8 = 1 (mod 17). Since 2^8 = 1 (mod 17), 2 is not a generator.\n\n- For g = 3: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 10, 3^4 = 13, 3^5 = 5, 3^6 = 15, 3^7 = 11, 3^8 = 16, 3^9 = 14, 3^10 = 8, 3^11 = 7, 3^12 = 4, 3^13 = 12, 3^14 = 2, 3^15 = 6, 3^16 = 1 (mod 17). Since 3^16 = 1 (mod 17) and all the powers of 3 generate all the non-identity elements in the group, 3 is a generator.\n\nSo, the generator of a group of prime order 17 is 3. Note that there can be other generators as well, but 3 is one of them."
