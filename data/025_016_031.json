    "message_2": "To find a rational map $\\phi: \\mathbb{P}^2 \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb{P}^2$ that sends $C_1$ to $C_2$, we need to find a map that transforms the equation of $C_1$ into the equation of $C_2$. Let's consider the following map:\n\n$$\\phi: [x:y:z] \\mapsto [x:y:z']$$\n\nwhere $z' = \\sqrt[3]{2}z$. This map is well-defined on the projective plane, since it only changes the third coordinate. Now let's see how this map transforms the equation of $C_1$:\n\n$$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^3 + y^3 + (\\sqrt[3]{2}z')^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^3 + y^3 + 2z'^3 = 0$$\n\nWe can see that the equation of $C_1$ is transformed into the equation of $C_2$ under this map. Therefore, the rational map $\\phi$ sends $C_1$ to $C_2$.\n\nNow we need to show that this map is birational, i.e., there exists an inverse rational map $\\phi^{-1}: \\mathbb{P}^2 \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb{P}^2$ that sends $C_2$ back to $C_1$. Consider the following map:\n\n$$\\phi^{-1}: [x:y:z'] \\mapsto [x:y:z]$$\n\nwhere $z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}z'$. This map is also well-defined on the projective plane. Let's see how it transforms the equation of $C_2$:\n\n$$x^3 + y^3 + 2z'^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^3 + y^3 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}z\\right)^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$$\n\nWe can see that the equation of $C_2$ is transformed into the equation of $C_1$ under this map. Therefore, the rational map $\\phi^{-1}$ sends $C_2$ back to $C_1$.\n\nSince we have found a rational map $\\phi$ that sends $C_1$ to $C_2$ and its inverse $\\phi^{-1}$ that sends $C_2$ back to $C_1$, we can conclude that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are birationally equivalent."
