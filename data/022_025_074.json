    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation with the given initial condition, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\nψ(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\niX(x)T'(t) = -1/2 X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\n(iT'(t))/T(t) = (-1/2 X''(x))/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -k^2:\n\n(iT'(t))/T(t) = -k^2 = (-1/2 X''(x))/X(x)\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) iT'(t) = -k^2 T(t)\n2) X''(x) = -2k^2 X(x)\n\nThe solution to equation (1) is:\n\nT(t) = e^(-ik^2t)\n\nThe solution to equation (2) is:\n\nX(x) = A e^(ikx) + B e^(-ikx)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for ψ(x, t) as:\n\nψ(x, t) = (A e^(ikx) + B e^(-ikx)) e^(-ik^2t)\n\nTo find A, B, and k, we need to use the initial condition ψ(x, 0) = e^(-x^2/2). Setting t = 0, we get:\n\ne^(-x^2/2) = (A e^(ikx) + B e^(-ikx))\n\nThis is a Gaussian function, and we can use the Fourier transform to find A and B. However, this is a complicated process, and the final result will be an integral representation of ψ(x, t). \n\nFor t = 1, the solution will be:\n\nψ(x, 1) = ∫(A(k) e^(ikx) + B(k) e^(-ikx)) e^(-ik^2) dk\n\nwhere A(k) and B(k) are the Fourier coefficients determined by the initial condition. The integral is taken over the entire range of k."
