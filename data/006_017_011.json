    "message_1": "A city has two main roads: A and B. The probability of a car accident occurring on road A is 0.03 and the probability of a car accident occurring on road B is 0.05. What is the probability of a car accident occurring on either road A or road B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a car accident occurring on either road A or road B, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nHowever, we are not given the probability of a car accident occurring on both roads (P(A ∩ B)). Since we don't have information about the dependence or independence of these events, we cannot determine the exact probability of a car accident occurring on either road A or road B."
