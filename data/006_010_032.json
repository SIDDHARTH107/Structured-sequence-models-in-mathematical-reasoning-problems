    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people affected by the disease) in n trials (in this case, 100 people selected)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence of the disease, which is 10% or 0.1)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 people)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 5 people affected by the disease)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(100, 5) * 0.1^5 * (1-0.1)^(100-5)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(100, 5), which is the number of ways to choose 5 people out of 100:\n\nC(100, 5) = 100! / (5! * (100-5)!)\nC(100, 5) = 100! / (5! * 95!)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorials, we get:\n\nC(100, 5) = 75,287,520\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = 75,287,520 * 0.1^5 * 0.9^95\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the powers and the product, we get:\n\nP(X = 5) â‰ˆ 0.010475\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 5 out of 100 people randomly selected from the demographic group will be affected by the disease is approximately 1.05%."
