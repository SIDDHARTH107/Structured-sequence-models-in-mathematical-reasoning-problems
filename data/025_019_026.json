    "message_2": "Let's first recall some basic facts about the Fano variety X of lines on a smooth cubic surface S in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The Fano variety X is a smooth surface of degree 6 in the dual projective space $(\\mathbb{P}^3)^*$. The Picard group of X is generated by the hyperplane class H, and we have $H^2 = 6$.\n\nNow, let L be a line on X, and let H be a hyperplane containing L. We want to find the degree of the intersection curve $H \\cap X$. Since the degree of X is 6, the degree of the intersection curve is given by the intersection number $(H \\cap X) \\cdot H = H^3$.\n\nUsing the fact that $H^2 = 6$, we can compute the intersection number as follows:\n\n$H^3 = (H^2) \\cdot H = 6 \\cdot H = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the intersection curve $H \\cap X$ is 6."
