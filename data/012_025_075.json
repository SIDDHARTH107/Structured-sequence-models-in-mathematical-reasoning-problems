    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, we need more information about the specific connections between the vertices. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n\nHowever, we can analyze the general properties of a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges to see if it is likely to contain a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nA graph with 6 vertices can have a maximum of 15 edges (when it is a complete graph). In this case, we have 8 edges, which is slightly more than half of the maximum possible edges. This means that the graph is not very sparse, increasing the likelihood of a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nAdditionally, we can use Dirac's theorem as a sufficient condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle. Dirac's theorem states that if a graph G has n vertices (n â‰¥ 3) and the degree of each vertex is at least n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nIn our case, n = 6, so n/2 = 3. If each vertex has a degree of at least 3, then according to Dirac's theorem, the graph G would have a Hamiltonian cycle. However, without more information about the specific connections between vertices, we cannot definitively determine whether G contains a Hamiltonian cycle or not.\n\nIf you provide the specific connections between the vertices, we can determine the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle and show it on the graph."
