Now, we can use the formula for the number of distinct groups of a given order, which is given by the product of the number of partitions of each of the prime powers in the factorization.\n\nFor 2^5, there are 7 partitions: (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), and (1,1,1,1,1).\n\nFor 3^1, there is only 1 partition: (1).\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible group structures for each partition of 2^5 and 3^1. We can eliminate the abelian groups, as we are only interested in non-abelian groups.\n\n1. (5) x (1): C_32 x C_3 = C_96 (abelian)\n2. (4,1) x (1): C_16 x C_2 x C_3 = C_32 x C_3 (abelian)\n3. (3,2) x (1): C_8 x C_4 x C_3 = C_24 x C_4 (non-abelian)\n4. (3,1,1) x (1): C_8 x C_2 x C_2 x C_3 = C_16 x C_6 (abelian)\n5. (2,2,1) x (1): C_4 x C_4 x C_2 x C_3 = C_16 x C_6 (abelian)\n6. (2,1,1,1) x (1): C_4 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_3 = C_8 x C_12 (abelian)\n7. (1,1,1,1,1) x (1): C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_3 = C_4 x C_24 (abelian)\n\nFrom the list above, there is only 1 distinct non-abelian group of order 96, which is the group with structure C_24 x C_4."
