    "message_1": "Auctions Inc. is selling a rare gemstone worth $10,000 through a sealed bid auction. There are two bidders, Alice and Bob, who each submit their bid in a sealed envelope. If Alice's bid is higher than Bob's bid, then Alice gets the gemstone and pays her bid amount. If Bob's bid is higher than Alice's bid, then Bob gets the gemstone and pays his bid amount.\n\nAssume that both Alice and Bob have independent private values for the gemstone, drawn uniformly from the interval [0, 20,000]. What bid should each person submit in order to maximize their expected utility (i.e. expected value of the gemstone minus the bid amount) in this auction?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote Alice's value for the gemstone as A and Bob's value as B. Both A and B are uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 20,000]. Let's also denote Alice's bid as a and Bob's bid as b.\n\nAlice's expected utility can be defined as the probability of her winning the auction (i.e., a > b) multiplied by the difference between her value for the gemstone and her bid (A - a). Similarly, Bob's expected utility can be defined as the probability of him winning the auction (i.e., b > a) multiplied by the difference between his value for the gemstone and his bid (B - b).\n\nTo maximize their expected utility, both Alice and Bob need to find the optimal bid that maximizes the probability of winning the auction while minimizing the bid amount.\n\nSince both A and B are uniformly distributed, the probability of Alice winning the auction is the probability of a > b, which is equal to the probability of a/B > b/B, or a/B > 1 - b/B. Integrating over the interval [0, 20,000], we get:\n\n∫(a/B) dA = ∫(1 - b/B) dB\n\nSolving this integral, we find that the optimal bid for Alice is a = A/2. Similarly, the optimal bid for Bob is b = B/2.\n\nSo, both Alice and Bob should submit a bid equal to half of their private value for the gemstone to maximize their expected utility in this sealed bid auction."
