    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line at a specific point on the curve, we need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe given equation is y = x^2 + 3x - 2.\n\nFirst, find the derivative dy/dx:\ndy/dx = d(x^2)/dx + d(3x)/dx - d(2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\ndy/dx = 2x + 3 - 0\ndy/dx = 2x + 3\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\ndy/dx(2) = 2(2) + 3\ndy/dx(2) = 4 + 3\ndy/dx(2) = 7\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at x = 2 is 7."
