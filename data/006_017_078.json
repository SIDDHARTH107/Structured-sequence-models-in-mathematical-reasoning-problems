    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one car accident occurring, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single car not having an accident is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 500 cars, the probability of no accidents occurring for all 500 cars is (0.95)^500.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one accident occurring by subtracting the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\nProbability of at least one accident = 1 - (0.95)^500 â‰ˆ 0.9941\n\nSo, the probability of at least one car accident occurring on this road in a day is approximately 0.9941 or 99.41%."
