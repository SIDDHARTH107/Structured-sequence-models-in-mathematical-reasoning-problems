    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 1, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 8x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule (d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)), we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 4x - 7\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 24x^2 + 4x - 7)\n\nUsing the power rule again:\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 4\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 1 is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 4."
