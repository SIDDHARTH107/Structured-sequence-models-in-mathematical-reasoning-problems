Let $[\\alpha]$ denote the cohomology class of a closed 1-form $\\alpha\\in\\Omega^1(M)$. Suppose that $[\\omega]=3[\\alpha]$. If $H^2(M;\\mathbb{Z})\\cong\\mathbb{Z}$, determine the value of $[\\omega]\\cdot[\\omega]$, where $\\cdot$ is the intersection product.",
    "message_2": "Since $[\\omega] = 3[\\alpha]$, we have that $[\\omega] \\cdot [\\omega] = (3[\\alpha]) \\cdot (3[\\alpha])$. Using the bilinearity of the intersection product, we get:\n\n$[\\omega] \\cdot [\\omega] = 3^2 [\\alpha] \\cdot [\\alpha] = 9 [\\alpha] \\cdot [\\alpha]$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the value of $[\\alpha] \\cdot [\\alpha]$. Since $M$ is a 2-dimensional surface, the intersection product is defined on $H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\times H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^2(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. We are given that $H^2(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $[\\beta]$ be a generator of $H^2(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. Then, for some integer $k$, we have $[\\alpha] \\cdot [\\alpha] = k[\\beta]$. Thus, $[\\omega] \\cdot [\\omega] = 9k[\\beta]$.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific surface $M$ and the closed 1-forms $\\alpha$ and $\\omega$, we cannot determine the exact value of $k$. So, the value of $[\\omega] \\cdot [\\omega]$ is $9k[\\beta]$ for some integer $k$."
