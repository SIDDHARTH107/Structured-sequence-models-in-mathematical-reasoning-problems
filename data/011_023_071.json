    "message_1": "Consider a planar graph G with 8 vertices. We want to assign colors to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. What is the minimum number of colors needed to accomplish this task?",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color a planar graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we can use the Four Color Theorem. The Four Color Theorem states that any planar graph can be colored using no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nTherefore, for a planar graph G with 8 vertices, the minimum number of colors needed to accomplish this task is 4."
