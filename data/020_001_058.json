    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and the profit per unit of product B is $15. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while each unit of product B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The company has total 1000 hours of labor and 900 hours of machine time available. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize the total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabor: 2x + y ≤ 1000\nMachine time: x + 3y ≤ 900\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. Solve for y in the labor constraint:\ny ≤ -2x + 1000\n\n2. Solve for y in the machine time constraint:\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 300\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersections of the constraint lines:\n\nIntersection 1: (0, 0)\nIntersection 2: (0, 300)\nIntersection 3: (450, 0)\nIntersection 4: (300, 200)\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function at each of the vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 300) = 10(0) + 15(300) = $4500\n3. Profit at (450, 0) = 10(450) + 15(0) = $4500\n4. Profit at (300, 200) = 10(300) + 15(200) = $6000\n\nThe maximum profit of $6000 is achieved when the company produces 300 units of product A and 200 units of product B."
