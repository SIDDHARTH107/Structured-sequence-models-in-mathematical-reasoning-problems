    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nPlugging this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = c^2X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $c^2X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n2. $T''(t) + c^2\\lambda T(t) = 0$\n\nWe first solve the ODE for $X(x)$. The boundary conditions are $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$. The general solution for this ODE is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $B = 0$ and $\\sqrt{\\lambda} = n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$. So, we have:\n\n$$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(nx)$$\n\nNow, we solve the ODE for $T(t)$. The general solution is:\n\n$$T_n(t) = C_n\\sin(nct) + D_n\\cos(nct)$$\n\nSince $u_t(x,0) = 0$, we have $D_n = 0$. So, we have:\n\n$$T_n(t) = C_n\\sin(nct)$$\n\nNow, the general solution of the wave equation is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(nx)\\sin(nct)$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(x)$:\n\n$$\\sin(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(nx)$$\n\nUsing the orthogonality of sine functions, we can find $A_n$:\n\n$$A_n = 2\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(x)\\sin(nx) dx$$\n\nFor $n = 1$, we have:\n\n$$A_1 = 2\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin^2(x) dx = 2\\left[\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{4}\\right]_0^{\\pi} = \\pi$$\n\nFor $n > 1$, we have:\n\n$$A_n = 0$$\n\nSo, the solution to the wave equation is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\pi\\sin(x)\\sin(ct)$$\n\nNow, we want to find the first non-zero time that the string would vibrate at the midpoint of the string, $x=\\pi/2$. We set $u(\\pi/2,t) \\neq 0$:\n\n$$\\pi\\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(ct) \\neq 0$$\n\n$$\\sin(ct) \\neq 0$$\n\nThe first non-zero time occurs when $ct = \\pi$, so:\n\n$$t = \\frac{\\pi}{c}$$"
