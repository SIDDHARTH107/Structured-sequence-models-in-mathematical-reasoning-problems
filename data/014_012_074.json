    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenere Cipher with the keyword \"CRYPTO\", we first need to repeat the keyword to match the length of the message. In this case, the repeated keyword is \"CRYPTOCRYPT\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square to find the encrypted message. The Vigenere square is a 26x26 table of letters, where each row is shifted one position to the left compared to the previous row. We find the intersection of the row corresponding to the letter in the message and the column corresponding to the letter in the keyword.\n\nM (message) + C (keyword) = W (encrypted)\nA + R = R\nT + Y = C\nH + P = U\nE + T = Z\nM + O = W\nA + C = C\nT + R = W\nI + Y = B\nC + P = Q\nS + T = G\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"WRCUZCWWBQG\"."
