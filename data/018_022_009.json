    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A⊕B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA⊕B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - { } = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A⊕B) and B, denoted as (A⊕B) × B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A⊕B) × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of B and (B⊕A), denoted as B × (B⊕A). Since the symmetric difference is commutative, we have B⊕A = A⊕B.\n\nB × (B⊕A) = B × (A⊕B) = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that (A⊕B) × B is not equal to B × (B⊕A). The ordered pairs are different, proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product."
