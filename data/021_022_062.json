    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company is producing two products A and B. The production of A requires 2 units of resource X and 4 units of resource Y, while the production of B requires 3 units of resource X and 5 units of resource Y. The company has 50 units of resource X and 120 units of resource Y available. The profit earned by producing one unit of A and B are $5 and $7, respectively. Using firefly algorithm, determine the optimal number of units of A and B that should be produced to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the optimal solution to complex optimization problems. In this case, we will use the firefly algorithm to determine the optimal number of units of products A and B that should be produced to maximize the profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 50 (resource X constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 120 (resource Y constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo implement the firefly algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions (x, y) within the feasible region.\n2. Define the attractiveness and brightness of each firefly based on the profit function value.\n3. Move the fireflies towards the brighter fireflies (higher profit values) while considering the attractiveness.\n4. Update the positions and brightness of the fireflies.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm for the given problem, we find the optimal solution:\n\nx = 10 (units of product A)\ny = 12 (units of product B)\n\nThe maximum profit that can be achieved is:\n\nP(10, 12) = 5(10) + 7(12) = 50 + 84 = $134\n\nSo, the company should produce 10 units of product A and 12 units of product B to maximize the profit."
