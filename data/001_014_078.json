    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(18), we need to find the prime factors of 18 and look for any perfect square factors.\n\n18 = 2 × 9\nSince 9 is a perfect square (3 × 3), we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\n√(18) = √(2 × 9) = √(2 × 3²)\n\nNow, we can use the property of radicals that states √(a × b) = √(a) × √(b) to separate the factors:\n\n√(18) = √(2) × √(3²)\n\nSince the square root of a perfect square is the base number, we have:\n\n√(18) = √(2) × 3\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n√(18) = 3√(2)"
