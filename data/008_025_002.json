    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n6x + 4y = 12\n(6x + 4y) / 2 = 12 / 2\n3x + 2y = 6\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n1) 3x + 2y = 8\n2) 3x + 2y = 6\n\nWe can see that the left sides of both equations are the same (3x + 2y), but the right sides are different (8 and 6). This means that there is no possible solution for x and y that would satisfy both equations simultaneously. Therefore, the system has no solution."
