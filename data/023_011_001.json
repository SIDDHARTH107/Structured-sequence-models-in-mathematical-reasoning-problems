    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of the given signal f(t) using the Fourier transform, we need to compute the continuous Fourier transform of the signal. The Fourier transform F(ω) of a continuous-time signal f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the entire time domain.\n\nIn our case, f(t) = 2sin(4πt) + 4cos(8πt) - 6sin(12πt). Let's compute the Fourier transform F(ω) for each term separately and then sum them up.\n\n1. For the first term, 2sin(4πt):\nF1(ω) = ∫[2sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nUsing the Euler's formula, sin(x) = (e^(jx) - e^(-jx)) / (2j), we can rewrite the integral as:\nF1(ω) = ∫[e^(j4πt) - e^(-j4πt)] * e^(-jωt) dt / j\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\nF1(ω) = (1/j) * [∫[e^(j(4π-ω)t) dt - ∫[e^(-j(4π+ω)t) dt]\n\nBoth integrals are of the form ∫[e^(jαt) dt], which evaluates to (1/jα) * [e^(jαt)]. So, we have:\nF1(ω) = (1/j) * [(1/j(4π-ω)) * [e^(j(4π-ω)t) - (1/j(4π+ω)) * e^(-j(4π+ω)t)]\n\n2. For the second term, 4cos(8πt):\nF2(ω) = ∫[4cos(8πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nUsing the Euler's formula, cos(x) = (e^(jx) + e^(-jx)) / 2, we can rewrite the integral as:\nF2(ω) = 2 * ∫[e^(j8πt) + e^(-j8πt)] * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\nF2(ω) = 2 * [∫[e^(j(8π-ω)t) dt + ∫[e^(-j(8π+ω)t) dt]\n\nBoth integrals are of the form ∫[e^(jαt) dt], which evaluates to (1/jα) * [e^(jαt)]. So, we have:\nF2(ω) = 2 * [(1/j(8π-ω)) * [e^(j(8π-ω)t) + (1/j(8π+ω)) * e^(-j(8π+ω)t)]\n\n3. For the third term, -6sin(12πt):\nF3(ω) = ∫[-6sin(12πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nUsing the Euler's formula, sin(x) = (e^(jx) - e^(-jx)) / (2j), we can rewrite the integral as:\nF3(ω) = -3 * ∫[e^(j12πt) - e^(-j12πt)] * e^(-jωt) dt / j\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\nF3(ω) = (-3/j) * [∫[e^(j(12π-ω)t) dt - ∫[e^(-j(12π+ω)t) dt]\n\nBoth integrals are of the form ∫[e^(jαt) dt], which evaluates to (1/jα) * [e^(jαt)]. So, we have:\nF3(ω) = (-3/j) * [(1/j(12π-ω)) * [e^(j(12π-ω)t) - (1/j(12π+ω)) * e^(-j(12π+ω)t)]\n\nNow, we can sum up the Fourier transforms of the individual terms to get the Fourier transform of the entire signal:\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) + F3(ω)\n\nF(ω) = (1/j) * [(1/j(4π-ω)) * [e^(j(4π-ω)t) - (1/j(4π+ω)) * e^(-j(4π+ω)t)] + 2 * [(1/j(8π-ω)) * [e^(j(8π-ω)t) + (1/j(8π+ω)) * e^(-j(8π+ω)t)] - (3/j) * [(1/j(12π-ω)) * [e^(j(12π-ω)t) - (1/j(12π+ω)) * e^(-j(12π+ω)t)]\n\nThis is the frequency domain representation of the given signal f(t) = 2sin(4πt) + 4cos(8πt) - 6sin(12πt)."
