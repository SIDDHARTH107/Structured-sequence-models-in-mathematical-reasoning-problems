    "message_1": "Consider a smooth, compact manifold M of dimension n and a Morse function f on M. Let x be a critical point of index k. Show that the number of critical points of f with index less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to the k-th Betti number of M. For example, if M is a sphere of dimension 2 and f is a Morse function, what is the minimum number of critical points of f?",
    "message_2": "To show that the number of critical points of f with index less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to the k-th Betti number of M, we will use Morse theory and the Morse inequalities.\n\nMorse theory relates the topology of a manifold M to the critical points of a Morse function f on M. The Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of f with a given index to the Betti numbers of M. The k-th Betti number, denoted b_k(M), is the rank of the k-th homology group of M.\n\nThe Morse inequalities state that for a Morse function f on a compact manifold M, and for each non-negative integer k,\n\nc_k - c_{k-1} + c_{k-2} - ... ≥ b_k(M),\n\nwhere c_k is the number of critical points of f with index k, and the signs alternate depending on the parity of k. In particular, we want to show that the number of critical points with index less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to b_k(M).\n\nSumming the Morse inequalities for k = 0, 1, ..., k, we get:\n\nc_0 - c_1 + c_2 - ... + (-1)^k c_k ≥ b_0(M) - b_1(M) + b_2(M) - ... + (-1)^k b_k(M).\n\nNow, we want to show that the left-hand side of this inequality is greater than or equal to b_k(M). Notice that the left-hand side is the sum of the critical points with index less than or equal to k. Since all the terms are non-negative, it is clear that the left-hand side is greater than or equal to b_k(M).\n\nFor the example of M being a sphere of dimension 2, we have b_0(M) = 1, b_1(M) = 0, and b_2(M) = 1. Using the Morse inequalities, we have:\n\nc_0 ≥ b_0(M) = 1,\nc_0 - c_1 ≥ b_1(M) = 0,\nc_0 - c_1 + c_2 ≥ b_2(M) = 1.\n\nFrom the first inequality, we have c_0 ≥ 1. From the second inequality, we have c_1 ≤ c_0. From the third inequality, we have c_2 ≥ 1. Thus, the minimum number of critical points of a Morse function on a 2-dimensional sphere is c_0 + c_1 + c_2 ≥ 1 + 0 + 1 = 2."
