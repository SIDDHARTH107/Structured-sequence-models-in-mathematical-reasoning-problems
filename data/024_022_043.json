    "message_2": "To find all isometries $f:\\mathbb{R}^2\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $f^*(g)=g$, we first need to understand what it means for a function to be an isometry and what it means for the pullback metric $f^*(g)$ to be equal to $g$.\n\nAn isometry is a function that preserves the distance between points. In this case, we want to find all functions $f(x,y) = (f_1(x,y), f_2(x,y))$ such that the distance between points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the same as the distance between points $f(x_1, y_1)$ and $f(x_2, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to the metric $g$.\n\nThe pullback metric $f^*(g)$ is the metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ induced by $f$. In other words, if $g$ is given by $g = dx^2 + 4dy^2$, then the pullback metric $f^*(g)$ is given by $f^*(g) = (df_1)^2 + 4(df_2)^2$, where $df_1$ and $df_2$ are the differential of $f_1$ and $f_2$, respectively.\n\nNow, we want to find all isometries $f$ such that $f^*(g)=g$. This means that we want to find all functions $f(x,y) = (f_1(x,y), f_2(x,y))$ such that $(df_1)^2 + 4(df_2)^2 = dx^2 + 4dy^2$.\n\nLet's compute the differential of $f_1$ and $f_2$. We have:\n\n$$df_1 = \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} dy$$\n$$df_2 = \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} dy$$\n\nNow, we want to find all functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ such that:\n\n$$(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} dy)^2 + 4(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} dy)^2 = dx^2 + 4dy^2$$\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 dx^2 + 2\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} dx dy + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 dy^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 dx^2 + 8\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} dx dy + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 dy^2$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $dx^2$, $dy^2$, and $dx dy$ on both sides, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 = 1$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 = 4$$\n$$2\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} + 8\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = 0$$\n\nThe solutions to this system of equations are the isometries we are looking for. The general form of the solutions is:\n\n$$f(x,y) = (a\\cosh(\\alpha x + \\beta y) + b\\sinh(\\alpha x + \\beta y) + c, d\\cosh(\\gamma x + \\delta y) + e\\sinh(\\gamma x + \\delta y) + f)$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d, e, f, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$ are constants that satisfy the above system of equations. These constants can be found by solving the system of equations, which can be done using various techniques such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods.\n\nIn conclusion, the isometries $f:\\mathbb{R}^2\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $f^*(g)=g$ are given by the general form:\n\n$$f(x,y) = (a\\cosh(\\alpha x + \\beta y) + b\\sinh(\\alpha x + \\beta y) + c, d\\cosh(\\gamma x + \\delta y) + e\\sinh(\\gamma x + \\delta y) + f)$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d, e, f, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$ are constants that satisfy the system of equations derived from the pullback metric condition."
