    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\" using a columnar transposition cipher with the key \"KEY\", we first need to arrange the key alphabetically and then fill the columns accordingly.\n\nThe key \"KEY\" can be arranged alphabetically as \"EKY\". Now, we can create a table with 3 columns and fill it with the message:\n\nE | K | Y\n-------\nM | A | T\nH | E | M\nA | T | I\nC | S | I\nS | F | U\nN |   |\n\nNow, we read the table by columns in the alphabetical order of the original key:\n\nE: MHAISN\nK: AETF\nY: TMIU\n\nThe encrypted message is \"MHAISNAETFTMIU\"."
