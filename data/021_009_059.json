    "message_1": "A manufacturing company can produce a maximum of 500 units of a product per day. The fixed cost of production is $2000 per day and the variable cost of production is $10 per unit. The selling price of each unit is $30. Formulate the cost function and revenue function for the company. Using the gradient descent method, find the number of units the company should produce per day to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "First, let's formulate the cost function and revenue function for the company.\n\nLet x be the number of units produced and sold per day.\n\nCost function, C(x) = Fixed cost + Variable cost * x\nC(x) = 2000 + 10x\n\nRevenue function, R(x) = Selling price * x\nR(x) = 30x\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function.\n\nProfit function, P(x) = R(x) - C(x)\nP(x) = 30x - (2000 + 10x)\nP(x) = 20x - 2000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We can do this by finding the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it to zero.\n\nP'(x) = d(20x - 2000)/dx\nP'(x) = 20\n\nSince the derivative is a constant, there are no critical points. However, we know that the company can produce a maximum of 500 units per day. So, we need to check the profit at the endpoints of the production range, which are 0 and 500 units.\n\nP(0) = 20(0) - 2000 = -2000\nP(500) = 20(500) - 2000 = 10000 - 2000 = 8000\n\nSince the profit is higher when producing 500 units per day, the company should produce 500 units per day to maximize profit."
