    "message_2": "A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn our case, V = 7. We want to find the maximum number of edges E that the graph can have while still being planar.\n\nSince the graph is planar, each face must be enclosed by at least 3 edges. Therefore, we have:\n\n3F ≤ 2E\n\nNow, we can substitute the Euler's formula into this inequality:\n\n3(2 + E - V) ≤ 2E\n6 + 3E - 3V ≤ 2E\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nFor V = 7, we have:\n\nE ≤ 3(7) - 6\nE ≤ 21 - 6\nE ≤ 15\n\nSo, a planar graph with 7 vertices can have at most 15 edges."
