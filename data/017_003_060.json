    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince G has order 17, which is a prime number, we know that |G| = 17. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. Since 17 is prime, the only divisors of 17 are 1 and 17. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and 17.\n\nNow, let g be an arbitrary non-identity element of G (i.e., g ≠ e, where e is the identity element of G). The subgroup H generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has order |H|, which must divide 17. Since g is not the identity element, |H| cannot be 1. Therefore, |H| must be 17.\n\nSince |H| = 17 and |G| = 17, we have that H = G. This means that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g, which is the definition of a cyclic group. Thus, G is cyclic."
