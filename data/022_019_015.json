If f(z) is analytic inside and on C, and \n\n∫C [f(z)/(z^2 - 1)] dz = πi/2, \n\nthen find the value of \n\n∫C [f(z)/(z - 1)] dz.",
    "message_2": "We are given that f(z) is analytic inside and on the circle C, which is defined by |z| = 2. We are also given that:\n\n∫C [f(z)/(z^2 - 1)] dz = πi/2\n\nWe want to find the value of:\n\n∫C [f(z)/(z - 1)] dz\n\nNotice that we can rewrite the given integral as:\n\n∫C [f(z)/((z - 1)(z + 1))] dz = πi/2\n\nNow, we can apply Cauchy's integral formula, which states that for a function g(z) analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, and a point a inside C:\n\n∫C [g(z)/(z - a)] dz = 2πi * g(a)\n\nLet g(z) = f(z) / (z + 1). Since f(z) is analytic inside and on C, and (z + 1) has no zeros inside C, g(z) is also analytic inside and on C.\n\nWe want to find the value of:\n\n∫C [g(z)/(z - 1)] dz\n\nBy applying Cauchy's integral formula with a = 1, we get:\n\n∫C [g(z)/(z - 1)] dz = 2πi * g(1)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of g(1):\n\ng(1) = f(1) / (1 + 1) = f(1) / 2\n\nSo, the integral we want to find is:\n\n∫C [g(z)/(z - 1)] dz = 2πi * (f(1) / 2)\n\nNow, we can use the given integral to find the value of f(1):\n\nπi/2 = ∫C [f(z)/((z - 1)(z + 1))] dz = 2πi * f(1) / 2\n\nSolving for f(1), we get:\n\nf(1) = 1/4\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the integral we want to find:\n\n∫C [g(z)/(z - 1)] dz = 2πi * (1/4) / 2 = πi/4\n\nSo, the value of the integral ∫C [f(z)/(z - 1)] dz is πi/4."
