    "message_2": "To find the point on the curve where the slope of the tangent line equals 4, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x. The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(x^2 - 3x)/dx = 2x - 3\n\nNow we need to find the value of x for which the slope of the tangent line (f'(x)) equals 4:\n\n4 = 2x - 3\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n7 = 2x\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 7/2 = 3.5\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can find the corresponding y-coordinate by plugging the value of x back into the original function:\n\nf(3.5) = (3.5)^2 - 3(3.5) = 12.25 - 10.5 = 1.75\n\nSo the point on the curve where the slope of the tangent line equals 4 is (3.5, 1.75)."
