Suppose $F$ is the subspace of $E$ defined by $F=\\{(x,y,z)|y=0\\}$. Prove that $F$ is a subbundle of $E$.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $F$ is a subbundle of $E$, we need to show that for each $x \\in X$, the fiber $F_x = p|_F^{-1}(x)$ is a linear subspace of the fiber $E_x = p^{-1}(x)$.\n\nLet $x \\in X$. Since $F$ is a subspace of $E$, we have $F_x \\subseteq E_x$. Now, we need to show that $F_x$ is a linear subspace of $E_x$. Let $v, w \\in F_x$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $F$ is a vector bundle over $X$, the fibers $F_x$ are vector spaces, and thus $cv + w \\in F_x$. Therefore, $F_x$ is a linear subspace of $E_x$.\n\nNow, let's consider the numerical example with $X = \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $E = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$. The continuous map $p: E \\rightarrow X$ is given by $p(x, y, z) = (x, y)$. The subspace $F$ is defined by $F = \\{(x, y, z) | y = 0\\}$, and the induced bundle map $p|_F: F \\rightarrow X$ is given by $p|_F(x, 0, z) = (x, 0)$.\n\nFor each $x \\in X$, the fiber $E_x$ is given by $E_x = \\{(x, y, z) | y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, and the fiber $F_x$ is given by $F_x = \\{(x, 0, z) | z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. Clearly, $F_x \\subseteq E_x$. Moreover, for any $v = (x, 0, z_1), w = (x, 0, z_2) \\in F_x$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $cv + w = (x, 0, cz_1 + z_2) \\in F_x$. Thus, $F_x$ is a linear subspace of $E_x$.\n\nTherefore, in this numerical example, $F$ is a subbundle of $E$. This confirms that if $F$ is a subspace of $E$ and a vector bundle over $X$ with the induced bundle map $p|_F: F \\rightarrow X$, then $F$ is a subbundle of $E$."
