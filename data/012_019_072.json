    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nTo find the chromatic index of this graph, we can use the greedy edge coloring algorithm. We will color the edges one by one, using the smallest available color that does not conflict with the colors of the adjacent edges.\n\n1. Color edge (1,2) with color 1.\n2. Color edge (1,4) with color 2.\n3. Color edge (1,5) with color 3.\n4. Color edge (2,3) with color 2.\n5. Color edge (2,4) with color 3.\n6. Color edge (3,4) with color 1.\n7. Color edge (3,6) with color 3.\n8. Color edge (4,5) with color 1.\n9. Color edge (4,6) with color 2.\n10. Color edge (5,6) with color 2.\n\nWe have successfully colored all the edges using 3 colors. Therefore, the chromatic index of this graph is 3."
