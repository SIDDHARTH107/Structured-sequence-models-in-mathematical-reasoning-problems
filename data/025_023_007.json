    "message_1": "A math student wants to calculate the dimension of the middle perversity intersection cohomology group $IH^{i}(X)$ of a complex projective variety $X$ given its Betti numbers. Let's suppose that $b_{0}(X)=1$, $b_{1}(X)=0$, $b_{2}(X)=50$, $b_{3}(X)=0$, $b_{4}(X)=1$, $b_{5}(X)=0$, $b_{6}(X)=0$, and $b_{7}(X)=1$. \n\nWhat is the dimension of the middle perversity intersection cohomology group $IH^{3}(X)$?",
    "message_2": "For a complex projective variety X, the middle perversity intersection cohomology groups are isomorphic to the ordinary cohomology groups, i.e., $IH^i(X) \\cong H^i(X)$. Therefore, the dimensions of the middle perversity intersection cohomology groups are equal to the Betti numbers of X.\n\nIn this case, we are asked to find the dimension of $IH^3(X)$. Since $IH^3(X) \\cong H^3(X)$, the dimension of $IH^3(X)$ is equal to the Betti number $b_3(X)$.\n\nGiven that $b_3(X) = 0$, the dimension of the middle perversity intersection cohomology group $IH^3(X)$ is 0."
