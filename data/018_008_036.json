    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a is in A and b is in B.\n\nGiven set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {4, 5}, let's calculate the Cartesian product A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian product B x A:\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. Therefore, the Cartesian product is not commutative."
