    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the connected graph G with 12 vertices and 20 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the minimum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 12 vertices. This can be done using the formula: minimum edges = vertices - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 edges.\n\n2. Calculate the maximum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 12 vertices and a diameter of 2. This can be done using the formula: maximum edges = vertices * (vertices - 1) / 2 = 12 * (12 - 1) / 2 = 66 edges.\n\nSince the graph has 20 edges, which is more than the minimum required (11) and less than the maximum required (66) for a diameter of 2, we can conclude that the diameter of the graph is at most 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when the diameter is 3:\n\n3. Calculate the maximum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 12 vertices and a diameter of 3. This can be done using the formula: maximum edges = (vertices - 1) + (vertices - 2) * (vertices - 3) / 2 = 11 + 10 * 9 / 2 = 11 + 45 = 56 edges.\n\nSince the graph has 20 edges, which is less than the maximum required (56) for a diameter of 3, it is possible to construct a connected graph with 12 vertices, 20 edges, and a diameter of 3.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the connected graph G with 12 vertices and 20 edges is 3."
