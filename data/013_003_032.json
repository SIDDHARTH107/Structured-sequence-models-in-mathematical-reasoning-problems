    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given 10 dollars and is asked to offer a share of the money to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, both players receive the amount offered to Player 2. If Player 2 rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. What is the largest share that Player 1 can offer to Player 2 that Player 2 is likely to accept?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the largest share that Player 1 can offer to Player 2 that Player 2 is likely to accept depends on the rationality and preferences of both players. \n\nIf both players are perfectly rational and want to maximize their own payoff, Player 1 can offer the smallest possible amount greater than zero (e.g., $0.01) to Player 2, as Player 2 would prefer to accept this offer rather than rejecting it and receiving nothing. However, this scenario assumes that both players are only concerned with their own payoff and do not care about fairness.\n\nIn reality, people often care about fairness, and experimental results have shown that offers around 50% are more likely to be accepted. So, if Player 1 wants to maximize the likelihood of their offer being accepted, they should offer around $5 to Player 2. This way, both players receive an equal share, and Player 2 is more likely to perceive the offer as fair and accept it."
