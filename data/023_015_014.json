    "message_2": "To determine the Fourier Transform of a square wave, we can use the Fourier series representation of the square wave and then find the coefficients of the series. The Fourier series representation of a square wave is given by:\n\nx(t) = A * Σ[ (1/n) * sin(2πnft) ], where the summation is over all odd n (n = 1, 3, 5, ...), A is the amplitude, and f is the frequency of the square wave.\n\nIn this case, A = 2 volts, f = 3 Hz, and the duration of the square wave is 0.2 seconds. The Fourier Transform of x(t) is given by:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[ x(t) * e^(-jωt) ] dt, where the integral is taken over one period of the square wave.\n\nSince x(t) is a periodic function, we can find the Fourier Transform by integrating over one period and then multiplying by a periodic delta function. The period of the square wave is T = 1/f = 1/3 seconds. So, we can integrate x(t) over one period and then multiply by the periodic delta function:\n\nX(ω) = (2/T) * Σ[ (1/n) * (1/(jω - 2πnf)) - (1/(jω + 2πnf)) ], where the summation is over all odd n.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for A, f, and T:\n\nX(ω) = (2/(1/3)) * Σ[ (1/n) * (1/(jω - 2πn(3)) - (1/(jω + 2πn(3))) ], where the summation is over all odd n.\n\nX(ω) = 6 * Σ[ (1/n) * (1/(jω - 6πn) - (1/(jω + 6πn)) ], where the summation is over all odd n.\n\nThis is the Fourier Transform of the given square wave. The student can now evaluate this expression for specific values of ω to find the value of the Fourier Transform at those frequencies."
