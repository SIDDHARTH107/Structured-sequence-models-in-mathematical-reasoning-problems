Historical data shows that stock A has an average annual return of 10% with a standard deviation of 12%, stock B has an average annual return of 12% with a standard deviation of 15%, and stock C has an average annual return of 8% with a standard deviation of 10%. \n\nWhat should be the optimal allocation of funds among the three stocks to maximize the expected return of the portfolio, while keeping the overall risk (measured in terms of standard deviation) below 10%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). According to MPT, the optimal allocation of funds among different assets is the one that maximizes the expected return for a given level of risk or minimizes the risk for a given level of expected return.\n\nLet x, y, and z be the proportions of the total investment in stocks A, B, and C, respectively. Then, x + y + z = 1.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as follows:\n\nRp = x * Ra + y * Rb + z * Rc\n\nwhere Ra, Rb, and Rc are the average annual returns of stocks A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nThe risk of the portfolio (measured in terms of standard deviation, σp) can be calculated as follows:\n\nσp^2 = x^2 * σa^2 + y^2 * σb^2 + z^2 * σc^2 + 2 * x * y * Cov(a, b) + 2 * x * z * Cov(a, c) + 2 * y * z * Cov(b, c)\n\nwhere σa, σb, and σc are the standard deviations of stocks A, B, and C, respectively, and Cov(a, b), Cov(a, c), and Cov(b, c) are the covariances between the returns of the respective stocks.\n\nSince we don't have information about the covariances between the stocks, we will assume that they are uncorrelated, which means that Cov(a, b) = Cov(a, c) = Cov(b, c) = 0. This simplifies the risk equation to:\n\nσp^2 = x^2 * σa^2 + y^2 * σb^2 + z^2 * σc^2\n\nWe want to maximize the expected return while keeping the overall risk below 10%. This can be formulated as an optimization problem:\n\nMaximize Rp = x * 10% + y * 12% + z * 8%\nSubject to:\nx^2 * 12%^2 + y^2 * 15%^2 + z^2 * 10%^2 <= 10%^2\nx + y + z = 1\nx, y, z >= 0\n\nThis is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. To solve this problem, we can use optimization techniques like the Lagrange multiplier method or quadratic programming. However, given the simplicity of the problem, we can also solve it using trial and error or by plotting the efficient frontier and finding the optimal allocation visually.\n\nBy trying different allocations and calculating the expected return and risk, we can find the optimal allocation that maximizes the expected return while keeping the risk below 10%. This will give us the optimal allocation of funds among the three stocks to achieve the desired investment objective."
