    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing each column with the constant terms (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we'll find the values of x, y, and z by dividing the respective determinants by D.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2  3  4 |\n| 5 -2  1 |\n| 1  1 -3 |\n\nD = | 2  3  4 | = 2((-2)(-3) - (1)(1)) - 3(5(-3) - (1)(1)) + 4(5(1) - (-2)(1)) \n    | 5 -2  1 | = 2(6 - 1) - 3(-15 - 1) + 4(5 + 2)\n    | 1  1 -3 | = 2(5) + 3(16) + 4(7) = 10 + 48 + 28 = 86\n\nNow, let's find Dx, Dy, and Dz.\n\nDx is obtained by replacing the first column of the coefficient matrix with the constant terms:\n| 25  3  4 |\n| 10 -2  1 |\n| -4  1 -3 |\n\nDx = | 25  3  4 | = 25((-2)(-3) - (1)(1)) - 3(10(-3) - (1)(-4)) + 4(10(1) - (-2)(-4))\n      | 10 -2  1 | = 25(6 - 1) - 3(-30 + 4) + 4(10 - 8)\n      | -4  1 -3 | = 25(5) + 3(26) + 4(2) = 125 + 78 + 8 = 211\n\nDy is obtained by replacing the second column of the coefficient matrix with the constant terms:\n| 2  25  4 |\n| 5  10  1 |\n| 1  -4 -3 |\n\nDy = | 2  25  4 | = 2(10(-3) - (1)(-4)) - 25(5(-3) - (1)(-4)) + 4(5(-4) - (10)(1))\n      | 5  10  1 | = 2(-30 + 4) - 25(-15 + 4) + 4(-20 - 10)\n      | 1  -4 -3 | = 2(-26) + 25(11) - 4(30) = -52 + 275 - 120 = 103\n\nDz is obtained by replacing the third column of the coefficient matrix with the constant terms:\n| 2  3  25 |\n| 5 -2  10 |\n| 1  1  -4 |\n\nDz = | 2  3  25 | = 2((-2)(-4) - (10)(1)) - 3(5(-4) - (10)(1)) + 25(5(1) - (-2)(1))\n      | 5 -2  10 | = 2(8 - 10) - 3(-20 - 10) + 25(5 + 2)\n      | 1  1  -4 | = 2(-2) + 3(30) + 25(7) = -4 + 90 + 175 = 261\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nx = Dx / D = 211 / 86\ny = Dy / D = 103 / 86\nz = Dz / D = 261 / 86\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 211/86\ny = 103/86\nz = 261/86"
