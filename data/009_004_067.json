    "message_1": "A simple harmonic oscillator is described by the differential equation $y''(t) + 16y(t) = 0$, where $y(t)$ is the displacement of the oscillator at time $t$. If the initial displacement is $y(0) = 1$ and the initial velocity is $y'(0) = 0$, what is the displacement at time $t = 3$?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation. The equation is:\n\n$y''(t) + 16y(t) = 0$\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\n$r^2 + 16 = 0$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n\n$r^2 = -16$\n\n$r = \\pm 4i$\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution for the differential equation is of the form:\n\n$y(t) = C_1 \\cos(4t) + C_2 \\sin(4t)$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ using the initial conditions.\n\n1) Initial displacement: $y(0) = 1$\n\n$1 = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0)$\n\n$1 = C_1$\n\n2) Initial velocity: $y'(0) = 0$\n\nFirst, we need to find the first derivative of $y(t)$:\n\n$y'(t) = -4C_1 \\sin(4t) + 4C_2 \\cos(4t)$\n\nNow, we use the initial velocity condition:\n\n$0 = -4C_1 \\sin(0) + 4C_2 \\cos(0)$\n\n$0 = 4C_2$\n\n$C_2 = 0$\n\nNow that we have the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$, we can write the particular solution:\n\n$y(t) = \\cos(4t)$\n\nFinally, we can find the displacement at time $t = 3$:\n\n$y(3) = \\cos(4 \\cdot 3)$\n\n$y(3) = \\cos(12)$\n\nSo, the displacement at time $t = 3$ is $\\cos(12)$."
