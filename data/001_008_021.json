    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 4 < 10, follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 4 from both sides of the inequality:\n   3x + 4 - 4 < 10 - 4\n   3x < 6\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\n   3x/3 < 6/3\n   x < 2\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x < 2.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from -3 to 3 (or any range that includes 2).\n2. Place an open circle (not filled in) at 2, since the inequality is strictly less than (not less than or equal to).\n3. Draw an arrow pointing to the left from the open circle at 2, indicating that all values less than 2 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph should look like this:\n\n<---(----)----)----)----)----)----)---->\n-3    -2    -1    0    1    2    3\n\nThe open circle is at 2, and the arrow points to the left, indicating that all values less than 2 are part of the solution."
