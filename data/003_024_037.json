The vector B has a magnitude of 5 and a direction of 120 degrees relative to the x-axis. What is the projection of vector A onto vector B?",
    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A • B) / ||B|| * B\n\nFirst, we need to find the dot product (A • B) and the magnitude of vector B (||B||).\n\nTo do this, we can convert the vectors A and B from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates:\n\nA_x = 8 * cos(35°) = 8 * 0.8192 = 6.5536\nA_y = 8 * sin(35°) = 8 * 0.5736 = 4.5888\n\nB_x = 5 * cos(120°) = 5 * (-0.5) = -2.5\nB_y = 5 * sin(120°) = 5 * 0.8660 = 4.330\n\nNow we can find the dot product (A • B):\n\nA • B = A_x * B_x + A_y * B_y = 6.5536 * (-2.5) + 4.5888 * 4.330 = -16.384 + 19.8592 = 3.4752\n\nNext, we find the magnitude of vector B (||B||):\n\n||B|| = sqrt(B_x^2 + B_y^2) = sqrt((-2.5)^2 + (4.330)^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 18.7489) = sqrt(24.9989) = 4.9998\n\nNow we can find the projection of A onto B:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A • B) / ||B|| * B = (3.4752 / 4.9998) * B\n\nProjection of A onto B = 0.6951 * B\n\nNow we need to multiply the scalar 0.6951 with vector B:\n\nProjection of A onto B_x = 0.6951 * (-2.5) = -1.7377\nProjection of A onto B_y = 0.6951 * 4.330 = 3.0065\n\nSo the projection of vector A onto vector B is:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (-1.7377, 3.0065)"
