    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components in M, we can use the following formula for the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ(M) = V - E + F\n\nwhere χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of M, V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. \n\nFor a compact 2-manifold without boundary, the Euler characteristic is related to the genus g and the number of connected components k by the formula:\n\nχ(M) = 2k - 2g\n\nGiven that the genus of M is 2, we have:\n\nχ(M) = 2k - 4\n\nWe are also given that the first Betti number (b1) is 4. The first Betti number is related to the Euler characteristic by the formula:\n\nb1 = 2g - 2 + k\n\nSince g = 2, we have:\n\n4 = 2(2) - 2 + k\n4 = 2 + k\nk = 2\n\nTherefore, the number of connected components in M is 2."
