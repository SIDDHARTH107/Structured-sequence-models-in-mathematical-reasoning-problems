(AMZN), $7,000 in Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and $8,000 in Facebook, Inc. (FB). Given the annualized mean returns and standard deviations for each stock as follows:\n\n| Stock | Mean Return | Standard Deviation |\n|-------|------------|--------------------|\n| GOOGL | 0.20       | 0.25               |\n| AMZN  | 0.25       | 0.35               |\n| MSFT  | 0.15       | 0.20               |\n| FB    | 0.18       | 0.30               |\n\nIf you want to minimize the portfolio risk while maintaining an expected annual return of at least 18%, formulate and solve the optimization problem to find the optimal weight allocation for each stock, assuming their weights must sum to 1.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem, we need to minimize the portfolio risk (standard deviation) while maintaining an expected annual return of at least 18%. We will use the following variables:\n\nw_GOOG: weight of GOOGL in the portfolio\nw_AMZN: weight of AMZN in the portfolio\nw_MSFT: weight of MSFT in the portfolio\nw_FB: weight of FB in the portfolio\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the portfolio standard deviation, which can be represented as:\n\nportfolio_std = sqrt(w_GOOG^2 * std_GOOG^2 + w_AMZN^2 * std_AMZN^2 + w_MSFT^2 * std_MSFT^2 + w_FB^2 * std_FB^2)\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. w_GOOG + w_AMZN + w_MSFT + w_FB = 1 (weights must sum to 1)\n2. w_GOOG * mean_GOOG + w_AMZN * mean_AMZN + w_MSFT * mean_MSFT + w_FB * mean_FB >= 0.18 (expected annual return of at least 18%)\n\nNow, we can solve this optimization problem using a quadratic programming solver or other optimization techniques. However, for this specific problem, we will use the scipy.optimize library in Python to solve it.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Objective function: portfolio standard deviation\ndef portfolio_std(weights):\n    std = np.array([0.25, 0.35, 0.20, 0.30])\n    return np.sqrt(np.sum(weights**2 * std**2))\n\n# Constraint functions\ndef constraint1(weights):\n    return np.sum(weights) - 1\n\ndef constraint2(weights):\n    mean = np.array([0.20, 0.25, 0.15, 0.18])\n    return np.sum(weights * mean) - 0.18\n\n# Initial guess for weights\ninitial_weights = np.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])\n\n# Constraints\nconstraints = [{'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint1},\n               {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint2}]\n\n# Bounds for weights (0 <= w_i <= 1)\nbounds = [(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Minimize the objective function\nresult = minimize(portfolio_std, initial_weights, bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)\n\n# Optimal weights\noptimal_weights = result.x\n```\n\nBy running this code, we will obtain the optimal weight allocation for each stock to minimize the portfolio risk while maintaining an expected annual return of at least 18%."
