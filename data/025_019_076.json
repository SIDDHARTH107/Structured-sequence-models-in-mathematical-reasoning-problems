    "message_2": "Let $X$ be the cubic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, and let $\\mathcal{F}$ be the Fano variety of lines in $X$. We want to compute the degree of $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nBy definition, the degree of $\\mathcal{F}$ is the number of lines meeting two general hyperplane sections $H_1$ and $H_2$ of $X$. Since the intersection numbers are $s_1 = 3$ and $s_2 = 7$, we know that a general line $L$ in $X$ meets $H_1$ in $3$ points and $H_2$ in $7$ points.\n\nNow, consider the intersection $X \\cap H_1 \\cap H_2$. This is a set of $3 \\times 7 = 21$ points. By the Cayley-Bacharach theorem, a line $L$ in $X$ that passes through $20$ of these points must also pass through the $21$st point. Therefore, there are exactly $21$ lines meeting both $H_1$ and $H_2$.\n\nThus, the degree of the Fano variety $\\mathcal{F}$ of lines in the cubic hypersurface $X$ is $\\boxed{21}$."
