    "message_1": "Consider the projective plane curve $C$ defined by the equation $y^2 z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$, where $\\lambda$ is a non-zero constant. Let $D$ be the divisor $(2,0,1)+(1,1,1)+(0,0,0)+(0,1,0)$ on $C$. Using the Riemann-Roch theorem, find the dimension of the linear system $|D|$.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Riemann-Roch theorem, we first need to compute the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. The curve is given by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3, so it is a smooth cubic curve. The genus of a smooth cubic curve is given by the formula $g = (d-1)(d-2)/2$, where $d$ is the degree of the curve. In this case, $d=3$, so the genus is $g = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 1$.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of the divisor $D$. The degree of a divisor is the sum of the coefficients of the points in the divisor. In this case, the degree of $D$ is $2+1+0+0 = 3$.\n\nThe Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have\n$$\nl(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g,\n$$\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the linear system $|D|$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$, and $l(K_C - D)$ is the dimension of the linear system $|K_C - D|$.\n\nIn our case, we have $g = 1$ and $\\deg(D) = 3$, so the Riemann-Roch theorem gives\n$$\nl(D) - l(K_C - D) = 3 + 1 - 1 = 3.\n$$\n\nTo compute $l(K_C - D)$, we first need to find the canonical divisor $K_C$. For a smooth cubic curve, the canonical divisor is given by $K_C = 3D$, where $D$ is any point on the curve. In this case, we can choose the point $(1,1,1)$, so $K_C = 3(1,1,1)$.\n\nNow, we compute $K_C - D = 3(1,1,1) - [(2,0,1)+(1,1,1)+(0,0,0)+(0,1,0)] = (1,1,1) - (0,1,0) = (1,0,1)$. Since this is a single point, we have $l(K_C - D) = 0$.\n\nFinally, we can solve for the dimension of the linear system $|D|$:\n$$\nl(D) = l(K_C - D) + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3.\n$$\n\nSo the dimension of the linear system $|D|$ is 3."
