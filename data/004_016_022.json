    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet f(t) represent the position of the car at time t, where t is measured in hours and f(t) is measured in miles. We are given that the car travels 120 miles in 3 hours, so we have:\n\nf(0) = 0 (starting position at city A)\nf(3) = 120 (ending position at city B)\n\nThe average rate of change of the function over the interval [0, 3] is:\n\n( f(3) - f(0) ) / (3 - 0) = (120 - 0) / 3 = 40 miles per hour\n\nSince the car's position function f(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 3] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 3) (as it represents the position of a moving car), we can apply the Mean Value Theorem. There exists a point c in the interval (0, 3) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [0, 3]:\n\nf'(c) = 40\n\nThe derivative of the position function, f'(t), represents the velocity of the car at time t. Therefore, at some point during the trip (at time c), the car was traveling at exactly 40 miles per hour."
