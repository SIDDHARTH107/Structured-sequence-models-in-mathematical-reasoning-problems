    "message_2": "To determine whether the set of zeros of f(z) is bounded or unbounded, we will use Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nLiouville's theorem states that every bounded entire function must be constant. In other words, if a function is analytic on the entire complex plane and its absolute value is bounded, then the function is constant.\n\nNow, let's assume that the set of zeros of f(z) is bounded. This means that there exists a positive number M such that all zeros of f(z) lie within the circle |z| < M in the complex plane.\n\nConsider the function g(z) = f(z)/z^n, where n is the number of zeros of f(z) within the circle |z| < M. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can write f(z) as a product of its zeros:\n\nf(z) = c(z - z_1)(z - z_2)...(z - z_n),\n\nwhere c is a non-zero constant and z_1, z_2, ..., z_n are the zeros of f(z) within the circle |z| < M.\n\nNow, g(z) is an entire function since it is the quotient of two entire functions, f(z) and z^n, and z^n has no zeros. Moreover, g(z) has no zeros within the circle |z| < M, because f(z) has zeros at z_1, z_2, ..., z_n, and these zeros are canceled by the zeros of z^n in the denominator.\n\nSince g(z) has no zeros within the circle |z| < M, there exists a minimum value of |g(z)| within this circle. Let's call this minimum value m. Then, |g(z)| ≥ m > 0 for all z with |z| < M.\n\nNow, let's consider the behavior of g(z) as |z| → ∞. Since f(z) is a non-constant entire function, its growth must be at least as fast as z^n for some positive integer n. Therefore, the growth of g(z) = f(z)/z^n is slower than that of f(z), and |g(z)| must be bounded as |z| → ∞.\n\nSince |g(z)| is bounded both within the circle |z| < M and as |z| → ∞, it follows that |g(z)| is bounded on the entire complex plane. By Liouville's theorem, this implies that g(z) must be a constant function. However, this contradicts our assumption that f(z) is a non-constant entire function.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the set of zeros of f(z) is bounded must be false. We conclude that the set of zeros of a non-constant entire function f(z) is unbounded."
