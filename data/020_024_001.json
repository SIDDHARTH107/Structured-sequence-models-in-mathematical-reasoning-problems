    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a product that has a fixed cost of 1000 dollars per unit. The company can sell up to 5000 units at a demand rate of 20 dollars per unit. However, for each increase in the unit price, the demand reduces by 50 units. Determine the optimal price that the company should sell the product to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the increase in the unit price. Then the new price per unit will be (20 + x) dollars. The demand will reduce by 50 units for each increase in the unit price, so the new demand will be (5000 - 50x) units.\n\nThe revenue function R(x) can be calculated as the product of the price per unit and the number of units sold: R(x) = (20 + x)(5000 - 50x).\n\nThe profit function P(x) is the difference between the revenue function and the total cost function: P(x) = R(x) - C(x), where C(x) is the total cost function. Since the fixed cost is 1000 dollars per unit, C(x) = 1000(5000 - 50x).\n\nNow we can write the profit function as: P(x) = (20 + x)(5000 - 50x) - 1000(5000 - 50x).\n\nTo find the optimal price, we need to find the maximum value of the profit function. We can do this by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = 0.\n\nFirst, let's expand the profit function:\n\nP(x) = 100000 - 1000x + 5000x - 50x^2 - 5000000 + 50000x = -50x^2 + 54000x - 4900000.\n\nNow let's find the derivative:\n\nP'(x) = -100x + 54000.\n\nSetting P'(x) equal to zero:\n\n0 = -100x + 54000.\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 54000 / 100 = 540.\n\nNow we have the optimal increase in the unit price. To find the optimal price, we add this value to the original price:\n\nOptimal price = 20 + 540 = 560 dollars per unit.\n\nSo, the company should sell the product at 560 dollars per unit to maximize its profit."
