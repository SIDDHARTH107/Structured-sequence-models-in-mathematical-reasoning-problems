    "message_2": "In the Euclidean plane with the metric g = dx^2 + dy^2, an isometry is a transformation that preserves distances between points. To preserve the orientation of the plane, the transformation must also preserve the handedness (i.e., not reflect the plane). There are two main types of orientation-preserving isometries in the Euclidean plane: translations and rotations.\n\n1. Translations:\n\nA translation is a transformation that moves every point in the plane by a fixed vector (a, b). The transformation can be represented as:\n\nT(x, y) = (x + a, y + b)\n\nTranslations preserve distances between points and the orientation of the plane.\n\n2. Rotations:\n\nA rotation is a transformation that rotates every point in the plane around a fixed point (called the center of rotation) by a fixed angle θ. The transformation can be represented as:\n\nR(x, y) = (x*cos(θ) - y*sin(θ), x*sin(θ) + y*cos(θ))\n\nRotations also preserve distances between points and the orientation of the plane.\n\nIn summary, the isometries that preserve the orientation of the Euclidean plane with the metric g = dx^2 + dy^2 are translations and rotations."
