    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12, 18, and 24, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the factorizations:\n2^3 and 3^2\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72\n\nThe LCM of 12, 18, and 24 is 72."
