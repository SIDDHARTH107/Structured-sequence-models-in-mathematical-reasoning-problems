    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with a 2x2 key matrix, we first need to represent the message as a set of numbers using A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, and so on. \n\nM = 12\nA = 0\nT = 19\nH = 7\n\nNow, we need to arrange the message into pairs of numbers and multiply them by the key matrix:\n\n| 5 8 |   | 12 |   | (5*12 + 8*0)  |   | 60 |\n| 17 3 | x | 0  | = | (17*12 + 3*0) | = | 204|\n\n| 5 8 |   | 19 |   | (5*19 + 8*7)  |   | 169 |\n| 17 3 | x | 7  | = | (17*19 + 3*7) | = | 346|\n\nNow, we need to take the results modulo 26:\n\n60 % 26 = 8\n204 % 26 = 4\n169 % 26 = 1\n346 % 26 = 0\n\nSo, the encrypted message is represented by the numbers 8, 4, 1, and 0. Converting these numbers back to letters using the same A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, and so on, we get:\n\n8 = I\n4 = E\n1 = B\n0 = A\n\nTherefore, the ciphertext result is \"IEBA\"."
