    "message_2": "To find the volume of the frustum using integration, we first need to find the equation of the radius of the cone as a function of its height. Since the cone is a right circular cone, we can use similar triangles to find this equation.\n\nLet r be the radius at height h, and R be the base radius (3 cm) and H be the height of the cone (10 cm). Then, we have:\n\nr/h = R/H\nr/h = 3/10\nr = (3/10)h\n\nNow, we can use integration to find the volume of the frustum. The frustum is formed between the heights 6 cm and 10 cm. The volume of the frustum can be found by integrating the area of the cross-sections of the frustum with respect to the height.\n\nThe area of a cross-section at height h is given by the formula A(h) = πr^2, where r is the radius at height h. Substituting the equation for r, we get:\n\nA(h) = π((3/10)h)^2\nA(h) = (9π/100)h^2\n\nNow, we can integrate A(h) with respect to h between the limits 6 cm and 10 cm to find the volume of the frustum:\n\nV = ∫[6, 10] (9π/100)h^2 dh\n\nTo integrate, we can use the power rule for integration:\n\n∫h^2 dh = (1/3)h^3 + C\n\nSo,\n\nV = (9π/100) * [(1/3)(10^3) - (1/3)(6^3)]\nV = (9π/100) * [(1/3)(1000 - 216)]\nV = (9π/100) * (784/3)\nV = 2352π/300\n\nThus, the volume of the frustum is (2352π/300) cm³."
