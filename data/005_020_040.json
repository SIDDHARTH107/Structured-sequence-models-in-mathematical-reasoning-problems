    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of rolling a three at least once in five rolls using Monte Carlo simulation, we will perform a large number of experiments and calculate the ratio of successful outcomes (rolling a three at least once) to the total number of experiments. Let's perform 1,000,000 experiments:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_die():\n    return random.randint(1, 6)\n\ndef experiment():\n    for _ in range(5):\n        if roll_die() == 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nnum_experiments = 1000000\nsuccesses = 0\n\nfor _ in range(num_experiments):\n    if experiment():\n        successes += 1\n\nprobability = successes / num_experiments\n```\n\nAfter running this simulation, we will get an estimated probability. Note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the simulation due to randomness. However, with a large number of experiments, the estimate should be close to the true probability.\n\nThe true probability can be calculated using the complementary probability: the probability of NOT rolling a three in five rolls. The probability of not rolling a three in a single roll is 5/6, so the probability of not rolling a three in five rolls is (5/6)^5. Therefore, the probability of rolling a three at least once in five rolls is 1 - (5/6)^5.\n\n```python\ntrue_probability = 1 - (5/6)**5\n```\n\nComparing the estimated probability from the Monte Carlo simulation to the true probability, we should see that they are close in value."
