    "message_2": "The divisibility rule of 7 states that to check if a number is divisible by 7, you can double the last digit, subtract it from the remaining leading digits, and continue this process until you get a smaller number. If the final result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7.\n\nLet's apply this rule to 9874:\n\nStep 1: Double the last digit (4) and subtract it from the remaining leading digits (98):\n98 - (2 * 4) = 98 - 8 = 90\n\nStep 2: Double the last digit (0) and subtract it from the remaining leading digits (9):\n9 - (2 * 0) = 9\n\nNow we have a single-digit number, 9, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 9874 is not divisible by 7.\n\nTo find the remainder, we can now simply divide 9874 by 7:\n9874 รท 7 = 1410 with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, the remainder when 9874 is divided by 7 is 4."
