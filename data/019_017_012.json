    "message_1": "Consider the language L = {+, . , 0, 1} and let F be the field of complex numbers. Define a model A = (F, +, . , 0, 1) of L where the interpretations of '+' and '.' are the usual ones for complex numbers. \n\nNow, write down a formula in L which is true in the model A if and only if -1 does not have a square root in F.",
    "message_2": "Let x be a variable in the language L. We can write the formula φ(x) as:\n\nφ(x) = (x . x) ≠ (-1)\n\nThis formula states that the square of x is not equal to -1. The formula is true in the model A if and only if -1 does not have a square root in F. Since F is the field of complex numbers, -1 does have a square root (i and -i), so the formula φ(x) is not true in the model A."
