    "message_2": "To calculate the moving average for a window of 3 months, we will take the average of each consecutive 3-month period. Here are the calculations:\n\n1. (January + February + March) / 3 = (23 + 28 + 30) / 3 = 81 / 3 = 27\n2. (February + March + April) / 3 = (28 + 30 + 33) / 3 = 91 / 3 = 30.33\n3. (March + April + May) / 3 = (30 + 33 + 36) / 3 = 99 / 3 = 33\n4. (April + May + June) / 3 = (33 + 36 + 38) / 3 = 107 / 3 = 35.67\n5. (May + June + July) / 3 = (36 + 38 + 40) / 3 = 114 / 3 = 38\n6. (June + July + August) / 3 = (38 + 40 + 45) / 3 = 123 / 3 = 41\n7. (July + August + September) / 3 = (40 + 45 + 48) / 3 = 133 / 3 = 44.33\n8. (August + September + October) / 3 = (45 + 48 + 52) / 3 = 145 / 3 = 48.33\n9. (September + October + November) / 3 = (48 + 52 + 55) / 3 = 155 / 3 = 51.67\n10. (October + November + December) / 3 = (52 + 55 + 58) / 3 = 165 / 3 = 55\n\nThe moving averages for the 3-month windows are as follows:\n\n1. 27\n2. 30.33\n3. 33\n4. 35.67\n5. 38\n6. 41\n7. 44.33\n8. 48.33\n9. 51.67\n10. 55\n\nInterpretation:\nThe moving average shows an increasing trend in the company's sales over the 12-month period. This indicates that the company's sales have been growing consistently throughout the year. The moving average helps to smooth out the fluctuations in the data and provides a clearer picture of the overall trend."
