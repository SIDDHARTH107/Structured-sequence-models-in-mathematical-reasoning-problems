    "message_2": "The Gosper Curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that grows with each iteration. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Segment Length) * (Scaling Factor)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations, and the scaling factor for the Gosper Curve is approximately 2.10457.\n\nFor this problem, the initial segment length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 5 iterations.\n\nLength = 1 * (2.10457)^5\nLength ≈ 1 * 55.6543\nLength ≈ 55.6543 units\n\nSo, the length of the Gosper Curve after 5 iterations is approximately 55.6543 units."
