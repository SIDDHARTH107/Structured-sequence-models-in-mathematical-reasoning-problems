Determine whether there exists a birational map between X and Y. If it exists, find the birational map explicitly by giving equations for the inverse and direct maps.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether there exists a birational map between X and Y, we will first try to find a rational parametrization for both curves. If we can find such parametrizations, we can then construct the birational map between them.\n\nFor the curve X, we can use the standard parametrization of a conic:\n\nx = 2st, y = s^2 - t^2, z = s^2 + t^2\n\nwith s and t being rational parameters. This parametrization works since:\n\n(2st)^2 + (s^2 - t^2)^2 - (s^2 + t^2)^2 = 4s^2t^2 + (s^4 - 2s^2t^2 + t^4) - (s^4 + 2s^2t^2 + t^4) = 0\n\nFor the curve Y, we can also find a rational parametrization:\n\nx = 2uv, y = u^2 + v^2, z = u^2 - v^2\n\nThis parametrization works since:\n\n(2uv)^2 - (u^2 + v^2)^2 + (u^2 - v^2)^2 = 4u^2v^2 - (u^4 + 2u^2v^2 + v^4) + (u^4 - 2u^2v^2 + v^4) = 0\n\nNow that we have parametrizations for both curves, we can construct a birational map between them. Let's define the direct map φ: X → Y by sending a point (x, y, z) on X with parameters (s, t) to a point (x', y', z') on Y with parameters (u, v) such that:\n\nu = s, v = t\n\nThen the direct map φ is given by:\n\nx' = 2uv = 2st = x\ny' = u^2 + v^2 = s^2 + t^2 = z\nz' = u^2 - v^2 = s^2 - t^2 = y\n\nSo φ(x, y, z) = (x, z, y).\n\nNow let's define the inverse map ψ: Y → X by sending a point (x', y', z') on Y with parameters (u, v) to a point (x, y, z) on X with parameters (s, t) such that:\n\ns = u, t = v\n\nThen the inverse map ψ is given by:\n\nx = 2st = 2uv = x'\ny = s^2 - t^2 = u^2 - v^2 = z'\nz = s^2 + t^2 = u^2 + v^2 = y'\n\nSo ψ(x', y', z') = (x', z', y').\n\nThus, there exists a birational map between X and Y, with the direct map φ(x, y, z) = (x, z, y) and the inverse map ψ(x', y', z') = (x', z', y')."
