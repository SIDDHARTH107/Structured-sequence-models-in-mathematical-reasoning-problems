    "message_2": "To disconnect a connected graph, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate connected components.\n\nA connected graph with `n` vertices has at least `n-1` edges. Therefore, in order to create two connected components, we need to have at least `(n1 - 1) + (n2 - 1)` edges, where `n1` and `n2` are the number of vertices in each connected component and `n1 + n2 = 12`.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario, which is when the two connected components have the maximum possible number of edges. This occurs when the number of vertices in each connected component is as balanced as possible, i.e., `n1 = 6` and `n2 = 6`. In this case, the minimum number of edges required for each connected component is `(6 - 1) = 5`, so the total minimum number of edges required is `5 + 5 = 10`.\n\nSince the original graph has `18` edges, we need to remove at least `18 - 10 = 8` edges to disconnect the graph."
