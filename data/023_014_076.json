    "message_2": "To find the wave function of the harmonic oscillator in momentum basis, we need to use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a wave function in position basis, ψ(x), is given by:\n\nΦ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) * ∫[ψ(x) * exp(-ipx/ħ)] dx\n\nHere, Φ(p) is the wave function in momentum basis, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and the integral is taken over all x from -∞ to ∞.\n\nGiven the wave function in position basis:\n\nψ(x) = (1/π)^(1/4) * exp(-x^2/2)\n\nWe can now plug this into the Fourier transform formula:\n\nΦ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) * ∫[((1/π)^(1/4) * exp(-x^2/2)) * exp(-ipx/ħ)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫[exp(-ax^2 + bx)] dx = √(π/a) * exp(b^2/(4a))\n\nIn our case, a = 1/2 and b = -ip/ħ. Thus, we have:\n\nΦ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) * √(π/(1/2)) * exp((-ip)^2/(4(1/2)) * (1/π)^(1/4)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nΦ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) * √(2π) * (1/π)^(1/4) * exp(-p^2ħ^2/(4ħ^2))\n\nFinally, we can simplify further:\n\nΦ(p) = (1/π)^(1/4) * exp(-p^2/2)\n\nSo, the wave function of the harmonic oscillator in momentum basis is:\n\nΦ(p) = (1/π)^(1/4) * exp(-p^2/2)"
