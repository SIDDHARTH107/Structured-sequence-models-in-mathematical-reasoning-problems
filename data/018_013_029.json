    "message_2": "(a) First, we need to find B ∪ C. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. So, B ∪ C = {2, 3, 4}. \n\nNow, we can find A × (B ∪ C). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is from the first set and b is from the second set. So, A × (B ∪ C) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\n(b) Now, we need to find (A × B) and (A × C). \n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nA × C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, we can find the union of these two sets: (A × B) ∪ (A × C) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nComparing the results from (a) and (b), we can see that they are equal:\n\nA × (B ∪ C) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n(A × B) ∪ (A × C) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nSince the results are equal, it does not prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union. However, it is important to note that this is just one example, and it does not prove that the Cartesian product is associative with respect to union in general."
