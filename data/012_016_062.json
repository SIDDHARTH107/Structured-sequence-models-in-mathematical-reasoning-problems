    "message_2": "The matrix-tree theorem is used to count the number of spanning trees in a graph. However, the Tutte polynomial is a more general graph invariant that contains information about not only spanning trees but also other substructures of the graph. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compute the Tutte polynomial using the matrix-tree theorem. \n\nInstead, we can compute the Tutte polynomial using the recursive deletion-contraction formula. The Tutte polynomial T(G; x, y) of a graph G can be computed as follows:\n\n1. If G is the empty graph, then T(G; x, y) = 1.\n2. If G has no edges, then T(G; x, y) = x^n, where n is the number of vertices in G.\n3. If G has an edge e that is neither a loop nor a bridge, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n4. If G has a loop e, then T(G; x, y) = y * T(G - e; x, y).\n5. If G has a bridge e, then T(G; x, y) = x * T(G / e; x, y).\n\nNow, let's compute the Tutte polynomial of the given graph:\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/Kz8YJjb.png)\n\n1. The graph has no loops or bridges, so we can apply the deletion-contraction formula on edge e = {1, 2}. We get T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y).\n\n2. The graph G - e has 5 vertices and 4 edges, and it is a tree. Therefore, T(G - e; x, y) = x^5.\n\n3. The graph G / e has 4 vertices and 3 edges, and it is also a tree. Therefore, T(G / e; x, y) = x^4.\n\n4. Combining the results, we get T(G; x, y) = x^5 + x^4.\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is T(G; x, y) = x^5 + x^4."
