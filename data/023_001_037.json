    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = |sin x| on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π, we first need to extend the function to be periodic on the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π. Since |sin x| is an even function, we can write:\n\nf(x) = |sin x|, -π ≤ x ≤ π\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series representation of f(x) using the Fourier coefficients. For an even function, the Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients, which can be calculated as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)] dx from -π to π\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nLet's calculate a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[|sin x|] dx from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[sin x] dx from 0 to π + ∫[-sin x] dx from -π to 0]\na_0 = (1/π) * [-cos x | from 0 to π + cos x | from -π to 0]\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-cos π + cos 0) + (cos 0 - cos(-π))]\na_0 = (1/π) * [2 + 2]\na_0 = 4/π\n\nNow, let's calculate a_n:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[|sin x| * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π\na_n = (2/π) * [∫[sin x * cos(n * x)] dx from 0 to π + ∫[-sin x * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to 0]\n\nWe can use integration by parts to solve these integrals:\n\nLet u = sin x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\nThen, du = cos x dx, v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[sin x * cos(n * x)] dx = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n= sin x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - ∫[(1/n) * sin(n * x) * cos x dx]\n\nNow, let's use integration by parts again for the remaining integral:\n\nLet u = cos x, dv = (1/n) * sin(n * x) dx\nThen, du = -sin x dx, v = (-1/n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\n∫[(1/n) * sin(n * x) * cos x dx] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n= cos x * (-1/n^2) * cos(n * x) + ∫[(-1/n^2) * cos(n * x) * sin x dx]\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the original equation:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [∫[sin x * cos(n * x)] dx from 0 to π + ∫[-sin x * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to 0]\na_n = (2/π) * [(sin x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - cos x * (-1/n^2) * cos(n * x) + ∫[(-1/n^2) * cos(n * x) * sin x dx]) from 0 to π - (sin x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - cos x * (-1/n^2) * cos(n * x) + ∫[(-1/n^2) * cos(n * x) * sin x dx]) from -π to 0]\n\nAfter evaluating the integrals and simplifying, we get:\n\na_n = (2/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x) = |sin x|:\n\nf(x) = (4/π) + Σ[((2/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)) * cos(n * x)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) = |sin x| on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π."
