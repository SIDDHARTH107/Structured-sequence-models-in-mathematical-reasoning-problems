    "message_2": "Since $E$ is a rank 2 vector bundle over $X$ with a trivial determinant line bundle, we have $\\det(E) = L \\otimes L^{-1}$ for some line bundle $L$. Let $e(E)$ denote the Euler class of $E$. We know that the Euler class of a vector bundle is related to its determinant by the formula:\n\n$e(E) = e(\\det(E))$.\n\nNow, we can use the properties of the Euler class and tensor products:\n\n$e(E) = e(L \\otimes L^{-1}) = e(L) \\cup e(L^{-1})$.\n\nSince $L^{-1}$ is the dual line bundle of $L$, we have $e(L^{-1}) = e(L)^{-1}$. Therefore,\n\n$e(E) = e(L) \\cup e(L)^{-1}$.\n\nNow, recall that the cup product is bilinear, so\n\n$e(E) = e(L) \\cup e(L)^{-1} = e(L) \\cup (e(L)^{-1}) = 1$.\n\nThus, the Euler class of $E$ is trivial, i.e., $e(E) = 1$."
