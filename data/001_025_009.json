    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we first need to distribute the x term to both the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers:\n\n$(3x + 2ix) - (2 - 3i) = (5x - 4ix) + (6 + 7i)$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation by grouping the real and imaginary parts together:\n\n$(3x - 2) + (2ix + 3i) = (5x + 6) + (-4ix + 7i)$\n\nNow, we can equate the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\nReal parts: $3x - 2 = 5x + 6$\nImaginary parts: $2ix + 3i = -4ix + 7i$\n\nNow, we can solve for x in each equation:\n\nReal parts: $3x - 2 = 5x + 6$\n$-2x = 8$\n$x = -4$\n\nImaginary parts: $2ix + 3i = -4ix + 7i$\n$6ix = 4i$\n$x = \\frac{2}{3}i$\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is:\n\n$x = -4 + \\frac{2}{3}i$"
