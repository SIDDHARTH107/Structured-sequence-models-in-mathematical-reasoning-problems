    "message_1": "A communication network has a signal with a frequency of 500 Hz that is being transmitted through a wire. The signal is corrupted by noise with a frequency range between 100 Hz and 400 Hz. What is the frequency spectrum of the corrupted signal after using the Fourier transform, and what is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)?",
    "message_2": "After using the Fourier transform, the frequency spectrum of the corrupted signal will show a peak at the signal frequency (500 Hz) and additional peaks within the noise frequency range (100 Hz to 400 Hz).\n\nTo calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we need to know the power levels of the signal and the noise. Assuming the power levels are given in decibels (dB), the SNR can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nSNR (dB) = Signal Power (dB) - Noise Power (dB)\n\nHowever, without the power levels of the signal and noise, we cannot calculate the exact SNR value. If the power levels are given in watts or any other unit, you can convert them to decibels using the formula:\n\nPower (dB) = 10 * log10(Power in watts)\n\nOnce you have the power levels in decibels, you can use the SNR formula to find the signal-to-noise ratio."
