    "message_2": "To prove that a specific group G has order 60, we first need to know the elements and the operation of the group. However, since this information is not provided, we will assume that we have already proven that G has order 60.\n\nNow, we need to identify which isomorphic group G is from the list given. To do this, we will analyze the properties of each group and compare them with the properties of G.\n\n1. Cyclic group C60:\nA cyclic group of order 60 is generated by a single element, say g, and all its powers: {1, g, g^2, ..., g^59}. If G is isomorphic to C60, then G must be abelian, as all cyclic groups are abelian. If G is not abelian, we can rule out C60.\n\n2. Alternating group A5 × C2:\nThe alternating group A5 is the group of even permutations of 5 elements and has order 5!/2 = 60/2 = 30. The cyclic group C2 has order 2. The direct product A5 × C2 has order 30 × 2 = 60. If G is isomorphic to A5 × C2, then G must be non-abelian, as A5 is non-abelian. Additionally, G must have a normal subgroup of order 30 (isomorphic to A5) and a subgroup of order 2 (isomorphic to C2).\n\n3. One of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60:\nIf G is not isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2, then it must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. These groups have various properties, and identifying which specific group G is would require more information about G.\n\nIn conclusion, to identify which isomorphic group G is from the list given, we need to analyze the properties of G, such as whether it is abelian or non-abelian, and the structure of its subgroups. Without more information about G, we cannot definitively determine which group it is isomorphic to."
