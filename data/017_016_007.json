    "message_2": "To prove that H is a normal subgroup of G, we will use the fact that the index of H in G is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G. Since the order of G is 27 and the order of H is 9, the index of H in G is [G:H] = 27/9 = 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of 27.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 27, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is either 1 or 3. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be normal, and we are done. If there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, then the normalizer of each Sylow 3-subgroup has index 3 in G. Since the index of H in G is also 3, H must be the normalizer of one of the Sylow 3-subgroups, and thus H is normal in G.\n\nNow we will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27. If G is cyclic, then it is isomorphic to C27. If G is not cyclic, then it must have an element of order 9, which generates a subgroup H of order 9. Since H is normal in G, we can form the quotient group G/H, which has order 3. Let K be a subgroup of G with order 3, so that G/H is isomorphic to K.\n\nLet x be a generator of H and y be a generator of K. Since the orders of x and y are 9 and 3, respectively, we have x^9 = e and y^3 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Also, since G has order 27, any element of G can be written as a product of powers of x and y. Thus, G is generated by the set {x, y}.\n\nNow we need to determine the product xy. Since H is normal in G, we have yx = x^i * y for some integer i. Then, (yx)^3 = x^(3i) * y^3 = x^(3i) * e = x^(3i). Since y^3 = e, we have (xy)^3 = x^3 * y^3 = x^3 * e = x^3. Thus, x^(3i) = x^3, which implies that 3i ≡ 3 (mod 9). The only solution for i in the range 0 ≤ i < 9 is i = 1. Therefore, yx = xy, and G is an abelian group.\n\nSince G is abelian and has an element of order 9 (namely, x), G must be isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups C9 and C3. However, since G has order 27, it cannot be the direct product of C9 and C3, as their direct product has order 9 * 3 = 27. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, H is a normal subgroup of G, and G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27."
