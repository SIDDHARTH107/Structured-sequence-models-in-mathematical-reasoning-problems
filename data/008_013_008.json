    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n\nx + 2y + z = 9\n2x + 8y + z = 23\n3x + 4y + 2z = 16\n\nThe coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix B are:\n\nA = | 1  2  1 |\n    | 2  8  1 |\n    | 3  4  2 |\n\nB = | 9  |\n    | 23 |\n    | 16 |\n\nNow, we perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 3 -2  1 |\n\nU = | 1  2  1 |\n    | 0  4 -1 |\n    | 0  0  1 |\n\nNow, we solve the equation LY = B for Y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | Y1 |   |  9  |\n| 2  1  0 | | Y2 | = | 23  |\n| 3 -2  1 | | Y3 |   | 16  |\n\nY1 = 9\nY2 = 23 - 2 * Y1 = 23 - 2 * 9 = 5\nY3 = 16 - 3 * Y1 + 2 * Y2 = 16 - 3 * 9 + 2 * 5 = 2\n\nSo, Y = | 9 |\n        | 5 |\n        | 2 |\n\nNow, we solve the equation UX = Y for X:\n\n| 1  2  1 | | X1 |   |  9  |\n| 0  4 -1 | | X2 | = |  5  |\n| 0  0  1 | | X3 |   |  2  |\n\nX3 = 2\nX2 = (5 + X3) / 4 = (5 + 2) / 4 = 7 / 4\nX1 = 9 - 2 * X2 - X3 = 9 - 2 * (7 / 4) - 2 = (9 - 7 - 2) = 0\n\nSo, X = | 0  |\n        | 7/4 |\n        | 2  |\n\nTherefore, the values of x, y, and z are:\n\nx = 0\ny = 7/4\nz = 2"
