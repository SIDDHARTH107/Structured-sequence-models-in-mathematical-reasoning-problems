    "message_2": "To find the inverse of the matrix A, we first need to find its determinant. The determinant of A is:\n\ndet(A) = 2(2*0 - (-1)*(-1)) - (-3)((-1)*0 - 1*(-1)) + 1((-1)*(-1) - 2*1)\n       = 2(0 - 1) - (-3)(0 - 1) + 1(1 - 2)\n       = 2(-1) + 3 + (-1)\n       = -2 + 3 - 1\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the matrix A is singular and does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot find the inverse of the matrix A."
