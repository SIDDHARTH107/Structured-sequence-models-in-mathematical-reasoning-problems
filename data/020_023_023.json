    "message_1": "Given a portfolio with $100,000 to be invested in stocks A, B, and C. The expected returns for stocks A, B, and C are 7%, 10%, and 12% respectively. The volatility for stocks A, B, and C are 8%, 12%, and 15% respectively. If the investor wants a portfolio with an expected return of at least 9% and a volatility of no more than 10%, what should be the allocation of funds for each stock in the portfolio?",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z be the allocation of funds for stocks A, B, and C, respectively. The total investment is $100,000, so x + y + z = 100,000.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by the weighted average of the individual stock returns: 0.07x + 0.10y + 0.12z. The investor wants an expected return of at least 9%, so 0.07x + 0.10y + 0.12z ≥ 0.09 * 100,000.\n\nThe volatility of the portfolio is given by the weighted average of the individual stock volatilities: 0.08x + 0.12y + 0.15z. The investor wants a volatility of no more than 10%, so 0.08x + 0.12y + 0.15z ≤ 0.10 * 100,000.\n\nNow we have a system of three inequalities:\n\n1. x + y + z = 100,000\n2. 0.07x + 0.10y + 0.12z ≥ 9,000\n3. 0.08x + 0.12y + 0.15z ≤ 10,000\n\nTo find the optimal allocation, we can use linear programming techniques. However, for simplicity, we can also try to solve this system of inequalities using substitution or elimination methods.\n\nFirst, let's solve equation 1 for z: z = 100,000 - x - y.\n\nNow substitute this expression for z into equations 2 and 3:\n\n2. 0.07x + 0.10y + 0.12(100,000 - x - y) ≥ 9,000\n3. 0.08x + 0.12y + 0.15(100,000 - x - y) ≤ 10,000\n\nSimplify equations 2 and 3:\n\n2. -0.05x - 0.02y ≥ -3,000\n3. 0.07x + 0.03y ≤ 5,000\n\nNow we can graph these inequalities to find the feasible region. The feasible region will be a polygon, and the optimal solution will occur at one of the vertices. To find the vertices, we can solve the system of equations formed by the intersection of the boundary lines:\n\n1. -0.05x - 0.02y = -3,000\n2. 0.07x + 0.03y = 5,000\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 40,000 and y = 50,000. Now we can find z using the expression we found earlier: z = 100,000 - x - y = 100,000 - 40,000 - 50,000 = 10,000.\n\nSo the optimal allocation of funds for the portfolio is $40,000 in stock A, $50,000 in stock B, and $10,000 in stock C."
