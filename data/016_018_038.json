    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust can be found using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/R)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and R is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor dust, at each iteration, the remaining line segments are divided into 2 equal parts, and one-third of the line segment is removed. So, N = 2 and R = 3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.6309."
