A complete subgraph is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nIn the given graph, we can observe the following cliques:\n\n1. {1, 2, 3} - a triangle (3 vertices)\n2. {2, 3, 4} - a triangle (3 vertices)\n3. {3, 4, 6} - a triangle (3 vertices)\n4. {3, 6} - an edge (2 vertices)\n5. {4, 5} - an edge (2 vertices)\n6. {1, 3} - an edge (2 vertices)\n7. {2, 4} - an edge (2 vertices)\n\nThe largest clique in this graph has 3 vertices, so the clique number is 3."
