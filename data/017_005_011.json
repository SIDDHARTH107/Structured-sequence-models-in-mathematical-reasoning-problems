    "message_2": "Since G has order 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides |G|, so n_3 divides 27.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal. Let P be this 3-Sylow subgroup. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. By the classification of groups of order p^2 (where p is prime), P is either isomorphic to Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. In either case, P is abelian, so G is also abelian.\n\nNow, consider the case where n_3 = 3. Let P_1, P_2, and P_3 be the distinct 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Since the intersection of any two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups is trivial, we have:\n\n|P_1 ∩ P_2| = |P_1 ∩ P_3| = |P_2 ∩ P_3| = 1.\n\nNow, consider the element g ∈ G such that g ∉ P_1. Since G is the union of its 3-Sylow subgroups, g must belong to either P_2 or P_3. Without loss of generality, assume g ∈ P_2. Then, the order of g is 3, and the subgroup generated by g, denoted by ⟨g⟩, has order 3. Since ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of P_2, we have:\n\n|P_1 ∩ ⟨g⟩| = 1.\n\nNow, consider the set H = P_1 ∪ ⟨g⟩. Since |P_1| = 9 and |⟨g⟩| = 3, we have |H| = 12. We claim that H is a subgroup of G. To prove this, we need to show that H is closed under the group operation and that it contains the inverses of its elements.\n\nLet x, y ∈ H. If x, y ∈ P_1, then xy ∈ P_1 ⊆ H. If x ∈ P_1 and y ∈ ⟨g⟩, then xy ∈ P_1g ⊆ H, since P_1g is a left coset of P_1 in G. Similarly, if x ∈ ⟨g⟩ and y ∈ P_1, then xy ∈ gP_1 ⊆ H. Finally, if x, y ∈ ⟨g⟩, then xy ∈ ⟨g⟩ ⊆ H. Thus, H is closed under the group operation.\n\nSince P_1 and ⟨g⟩ are both subgroups, they contain the inverses of their elements. Thus, H contains the inverses of its elements. Therefore, H is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we have a subgroup H of order 12. By the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have:\n\nG / H ≅ P_1 / (P_1 ∩ ⟨g⟩) ≅ P_1.\n\nSince P_1 is a group of order 9, G / H is also a group of order 9. Thus, G is an extension of a group of order 9 by a group of order 3. By the classification of groups of order 9, G / H is either isomorphic to Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. In either case, G / H is abelian, so G is also abelian.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that G is abelian in both cases (n_3 = 1 and n_3 = 3). Since G is a group of order 27, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z_27, Z_9 × Z_3, or Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3. However, the last group has an order of 3^3 but is non-abelian, which contradicts our finding that G is abelian. Therefore, G must be either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_27) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (isomorphic to Z_9 × Z_3)."
