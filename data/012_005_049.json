    "message_1": "What is the diameter of a graph with 7 vertices, where the vertex degrees are {2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4} and the edges are: \n\n{1,2}, {1,3}, {2,4}, {3,5}, {3,6}, {4,7}, {5,7}, {6,7}?",
    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the length of the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. To find the diameter, we can first represent the graph using the given edges:\n\n```\n1 - 2 - 4 - 7\n  \\\n   3 - 5\n    \\\n     6\n```\n\nNow, we can find the shortest path between each pair of vertices:\n\n1. 1-2: 1\n2. 1-3: 1\n3. 1-4: 2\n4. 1-5: 2\n5. 1-6: 2\n6. 1-7: 3\n7. 2-3: 2\n8. 2-4: 1\n9. 2-5: 3\n10. 2-6: 3\n11. 2-7: 2\n12. 3-4: 3\n13. 3-5: 1\n14. 3-6: 1\n15. 3-7: 2\n16. 4-5: 4\n17. 4-6: 4\n18. 4-7: 1\n19. 5-6: 2\n20. 5-7: 1\n21. 6-7: 1\n\nThe longest shortest path is between vertices 4 and 5, with a length of 4. Therefore, the diameter of the graph is 4."
