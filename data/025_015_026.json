    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (-1, 1, 1), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe surface equation is: F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3xyz = 0\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x - 3yz\n∂F/∂y = 2y - 3xz\n∂F/∂z = 2z - 3xy\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (-1, 1, 1):\n\n∂F/∂x(-1, 1, 1) = 2(-1) - 3(1)(1) = -2 - 3 = -5\n∂F/∂y(-1, 1, 1) = 2(1) - 3(-1)(1) = 2 + 3 = 5\n∂F/∂z(-1, 1, 1) = 2(1) - 3(-1)(1) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the gradient of the surface at the point (-1, 1, 1) is given by the vector <-5, 5, 5>.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector to the plane (which is the gradient vector), and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point on the plane.\n\nUsing the gradient vector <-5, 5, 5> and the point (-1, 1, 1), we get:\n\n-5(x - (-1)) + 5(y - 1) + 5(z - 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-5(x + 1) + 5(y - 1) + 5(z - 1) = 0\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (-1, 1, 1) is:\n\n-5x - 5 + 5y - 5 + 5z - 5 = 0\n\nor\n\n-5x + 5y + 5z = 5"
