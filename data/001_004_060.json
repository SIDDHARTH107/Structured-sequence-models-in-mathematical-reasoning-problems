    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 3x^3 - 15x^2 - 12x, we first look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. The GCF of 3x^3, -15x^2, and -12x is 3x. We factor out the GCF:\n\n3x(x^2 - 5x - 4)\n\nNow we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 5x - 4\n\nTo factor this quadratic, we look for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to -5. Those numbers are -4 and 1. So we can rewrite the quadratic as:\n\n(x - 4)(x + 1)\n\nNow, we put it all together:\n\n3x(x^2 - 5x - 4) = 3x(x - 4)(x + 1)\n\nSo the factored form of the polynomial 3x^3 - 15x^2 - 12x is 3x(x - 4)(x + 1)."
