    "message_1": "A fly hovering 2 meters away from a lamp is trying to reach a piece of food sitting on the lamp. The angle of elevation from the fly to the food is 60 degrees. What is the distance the fly needs to travel to reach the food? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a meter.",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using trigonometry. We have the angle of elevation (60 degrees) and the horizontal distance (2 meters) from the fly to the lamp. We can use the tangent function to find the vertical distance from the fly to the food.\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\n\ntan(60) = vertical distance/2\n\nTo find the vertical distance, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nvertical distance = 2 * tan(60)\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is √3, so:\n\nvertical distance = 2 * √3 ≈ 3.46 meters\n\nNow we have a right triangle with a horizontal distance of 2 meters and a vertical distance of approximately 3.46 meters. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, which represents the distance the fly needs to travel to reach the food.\n\na² + b² = c²\n\n2² + 3.46² = c²\n\n4 + 11.9716 = c²\n\n15.9716 = c²\n\nc = √15.9716 ≈ 3.997\n\nThe distance the fly needs to travel to reach the food is approximately 4.0 meters, rounded to the nearest tenth of a meter."
