    "message_2": "Let g be a generator of G. Since G is a cyclic group of order 15, we have g^15 = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H of order 5. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H divides the order of the group G. In this case, |H| = 5 divides |G| = 15. \n\nTo find a generator of H, we need to find an element h in H such that the order of h is 5. Since H is a subgroup of G, we can express the elements of H in terms of the generator g of G.\n\nWe know that the order of g^k, where k is a positive integer, is given by the formula:\n\norder(g^k) = |G| / gcd(|G|, k)\n\nIn our case, we want to find a k such that the order of g^k is 5. So, we have:\n\n5 = 15 / gcd(15, k)\n\nMultiplying both sides by gcd(15, k), we get:\n\n5 * gcd(15, k) = 15\n\nNow, we need to find a k that satisfies this equation. We can start by testing different values of k:\n\n1. If k = 1, gcd(15, 1) = 1, and 5 * 1 = 5, which is not equal to 15.\n2. If k = 2, gcd(15, 2) = 1, and 5 * 1 = 5, which is not equal to 15.\n3. If k = 3, gcd(15, 3) = 3, and 5 * 3 = 15, which is equal to 15.\n\nSo, k = 3 satisfies the equation. Therefore, a generator of the subgroup H is given by:\n\nh = g^3\n\nThis element h has order 5, and it generates the subgroup H of G with order 5."
