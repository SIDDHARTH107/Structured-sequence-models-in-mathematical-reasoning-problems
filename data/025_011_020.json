    "message_2": "To find the order of the group of rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$, we can use the Lutz-Nagell theorem, which states that for an elliptic curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ with integer coefficients $A$ and $B$, the order of the group of rational points is finite.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the given equation as $y^2 = x(x^2 - 1) = x(x - 1)(x + 1)$. Now, we consider the possible values of $x$:\n\n1. If $x = 0$, then $y^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$. This gives us the point $(0, 0)$.\n\n2. If $x = 1$, then $y^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$. This gives us the point $(1, 0)$.\n\n3. If $x = -1$, then $y^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$. This gives us the point $(-1, 0)$.\n\n4. If $x \\neq 0, \\pm 1$, then $x(x - 1)(x + 1)$ must be a square. Since $x$, $x - 1$, and $x + 1$ are pairwise coprime, each of them must be a square. However, this is impossible since two consecutive integers cannot both be squares.\n\nThus, there are only three rational points on the elliptic curve: $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(-1, 0)$. Therefore, the order of the group of rational points on this elliptic curve is 3."
