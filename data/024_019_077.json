    "message_2": "To calculate the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1,f(1,1)), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface S.\n\nGiven the surface S: z = f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2, we can define the position vector r(x,y) = (x, y, x^2 + y^2).\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\nr_x = (∂r/∂x) = (1, 0, 2x)\nr_y = (∂r/∂y) = (0, 1, 2y)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nI = [ (r_x • r_x)  (r_x • r_y) ]\n      [ (r_y • r_x)  (r_y • r_y) ]\n\nI = [ (1 + 4x^2)  (4xy) ]\n      [ (4xy)  (1 + 4y^2) ]\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\nr_xx = (∂²r/∂x²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_yy = (∂²r/∂y²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_xy = (∂²r/∂x∂y) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nII = [ (r_xx • N)  (r_xy • N) ]\n       [ (r_xy • N)  (r_yy • N) ]\n\nFirst, we need to find the normal vector N. We can find it by taking the cross product of r_x and r_y:\nN = r_x × r_y = (2x, 2y, -1)\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form:\nII = [ (2)  (0) ]\n       [ (0)  (2) ]\n\nFinally, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\nK = (det(II)) / (det(I))\n\nAt the point (1,1,f(1,1)), we have:\nI = [ (1 + 4)  (4) ]\n      [ (4)  (1 + 4) ]\n\nI = [ (5)  (4) ]\n      [ (4)  (5) ]\n\nK = (2 * 2) / (5^2 - 4^2)\nK = 4 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1,f(1,1)) is 4/9."
