    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of the function $f(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 3z + 2$ in the region $|z| < 2$, we can apply Rouche's theorem. Rouche's theorem states that if two analytic functions $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ satisfy $|f(z) - g(z)| < |g(z)|$ on a closed contour, then $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have the same number of zeros inside the contour.\n\nLet's choose $g(z) = z^3$. We want to show that $|f(z) - g(z)| < |g(z)|$ on the circle $|z| = 2$. \n\nFirst, let's compute $f(z) - g(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 3z + 2 - z^3 = -4z^2 + 3z + 2$. Now, let's find the maximum value of $|-4z^2 + 3z + 2|$ on the circle $|z| = 2$.\n\nWe can rewrite $z = re^{i\\theta}$, where $r = 2$ and $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, $|-4z^2 + 3z + 2| = |-4(2e^{i\\theta})^2 + 3(2e^{i\\theta}) + 2| = |-32e^{2i\\theta} + 6e^{i\\theta} + 2|$.\n\nNow, we can use the triangle inequality: $|-32e^{2i\\theta} + 6e^{i\\theta} + 2| \\leq |-32e^{2i\\theta}| + |6e^{i\\theta}| + |2| = 32 + 6 + 2 = 40$.\n\nOn the other hand, $|g(z)| = |z^3| = |(2e^{i\\theta})^3| = 8$. Since $40 > 8$, we cannot directly apply Rouche's theorem.\n\nHowever, we can try another approach. Let's factor the polynomial $f(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 3z + 2$. Using the rational root theorem, we can find that $f(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 - 3z - 2)$. Now, let's find the zeros of the quadratic factor: $z^2 - 3z - 2 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$z = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's check if these zeros are inside the region $|z| < 2$:\n\n1. $z = 1$ is inside the region since $|1| < 2$.\n2. $z = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\approx 2.30$ is outside the region since $|2.30| > 2$.\n3. $z = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\approx -0.30$ is inside the region since $|-0.30| < 2$.\n\nThus, there are 2 zeros of the function $f(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 3z + 2$ in the region $|z| < 2$."
