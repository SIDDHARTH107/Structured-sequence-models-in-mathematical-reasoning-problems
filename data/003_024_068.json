    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector a onto vector b using trigonometry, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can do this using the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of a and b is:\na · b = (5 * -3) + (2 * 4) = -15 + 8 = -7\n\nThe magnitudes of a and b are:\n|a| = √(5^2 + 2^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n|b| = √((-3)^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNow we can find the angle θ between the two vectors using the dot product formula:\na · b = |a| * |b| * cos(θ)\n-7 = √29 * 5 * cos(θ)\n\nSolving for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = -7 / (√29 * 5)\ncos(θ) ≈ -0.2582\n\nNow we can find the angle θ:\nθ ≈ arccos(-0.2582) ≈ 1.831 radians (or 104.92 degrees)\n\nTo find the projection of vector a onto vector b, we can use the formula:\nproj_ab = |a| * cos(θ)\n\nproj_ab = √29 * (-0.2582)\nproj_ab ≈ -1.498\n\nThe magnitude of the projection of vector a onto vector b is approximately 1.498."
