    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given partial differential equation in terms of the complex variable $z = x + iy$, we first rewrite the equation using the Wirtinger derivatives with respect to $z$ and $\\bar{z}$.\n\nRecall that the Wirtinger derivatives are defined as:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we can express the second-order derivatives in terms of the Wirtinger derivatives:\n\n$u_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\bar{z} \\partial z}$\n\n$u_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(-i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}}\\right) = -i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} + i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\bar{z} \\partial z}$\n\n$u_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}}\\right) = -i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} + i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\bar{z} \\partial z}$\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$u_{xx} - 2u_{xy} + u_{yy} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\bar{z} \\partial z}\\right) - 2\\left(-i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} + i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\bar{z} \\partial z}\\right) + \\left(-i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} + i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\bar{z} \\partial z}\\right) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$4i\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} = 0$\n\nThis implies that $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} = 0$. Integrating with respect to $z$ and $\\bar{z}$, we obtain the general solution:\n\n$u(z, \\bar{z}) = f(z) + g(\\bar{z})$\n\nwhere $f(z)$ and $g(\\bar{z})$ are arbitrary analytic functions of $z$ and $\\bar{z}$, respectively."
