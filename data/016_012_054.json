    "message_2": "The problem you described is not the Peano curve but the Koch curve (also known as the Koch snowflake). The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, while the Koch curve is a fractal curve. I will solve the problem for the Koch curve.\n\nLet's denote the length of the initial segment as L. After the first iteration, the length of the curve will be 4/3 times the length of the initial segment, since we replace the middle third with two segments of equal length (forming an equilateral triangle).\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, we apply the same process to each of the segments, so the length of the curve will be multiplied by 4/3 again. After n iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\nL_n = L * (4/3)^n\n\nFor the first five iterations (n=5), the length of the Koch curve will be:\n\nL_5 = L * (4/3)^5\n\nL_5 â‰ˆ L * 6.497\n\nSo, the length of the Koch curve after the first five iterations will be approximately 6.497 times the length of the initial segment."
