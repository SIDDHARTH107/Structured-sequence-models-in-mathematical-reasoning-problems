    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 7 cm and a height of 12 cm. Find its volume in cubic centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * (7²) * 12\n\nFirst, we square the radius (7² = 49):\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 49 * 12\n\nNext, we multiply 49 by 12:\n\n49 * 12 = 588\n\nNow, we have:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 588\n\nThen, we multiply 3.14159 by 588:\n\n3.14159 * 588 ≈ 1846.35532\n\nFinally, we multiply this result by (1/3):\n\n1846.35532 * (1/3) ≈ 615.45177\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 615.45 cubic centimeters."
