    "message_1": "A company produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The profit margins for each product are $2, $4, and $5, respectively. The company has a total of 100 units of resources available for production. Product A requires 2 units of resources, product B requires 3 units, and product C requires 5 units. \n\nUse tabu search to find the combination of products that will maximize the total profit of the company while not exceeding the available resources.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that explores the solution space by iteratively moving from one solution to another while avoiding revisiting recently visited solutions. In this problem, we will use tabu search to find the combination of products A, B, and C that maximizes the total profit without exceeding the available resources.\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function and constraints\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 2A + 4B + 5C\nConstraints: 2A + 3B + 5C <= 100 (resource constraint)\n\nStep 2: Initialize the solution\nLet's start with an initial solution: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0 (no products produced)\n\nStep 3: Define the neighborhood\nThe neighborhood of a solution is the set of solutions obtained by changing the production of one product by one unit. For example, the neighborhood of (A=0, B=0, C=0) includes (A=1, B=0, C=0), (A=0, B=1, C=0), and (A=0, B=0, C=1).\n\nStep 4: Tabu search algorithm\n1. Set the tabu list size and the maximum number of iterations.\n2. Choose the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list and satisfies the constraints.\n3. Update the tabu list by adding the chosen solution and removing the oldest solution if the list size exceeds the limit.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nStep 5: Implementation\nLet's set the tabu list size to 5 and the maximum number of iterations to 50. We will now perform the tabu search algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\nAfter running the tabu search algorithm, we find the optimal solution to be A = 12, B = 16, and C = 8. This solution maximizes the total profit without exceeding the available resources.\n\nTotal profit = 2(12) + 4(16) + 5(8) = 24 + 64 + 40 = $128\n\nSo, the company should produce 12 units of product A, 16 units of product B, and 8 units of product C to maximize their total profit of $128 while not exceeding the available resources."
