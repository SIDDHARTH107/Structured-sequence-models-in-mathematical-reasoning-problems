    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 7, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nStep 1: Find the derivative of f(x)\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 7)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nStep 2: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x\n0 = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first simplify by dividing the entire equation by 3:\n0 = x^2 - 6x + 8\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n0 = (x - 4)(x - 2)\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get two critical points:\nx - 4 = 0 => x = 4\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 7 are x = 2 and x = 4."
