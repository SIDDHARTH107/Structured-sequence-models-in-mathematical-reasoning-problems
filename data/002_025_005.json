    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has two equal sides each measuring 7 cm and the base is 12 cm. What is the length of the altitude to the base?",
    "message_2": "Let's call the isosceles triangle ABC, where A is the vertex between the two equal sides, and B and C are the endpoints of the base. Let D be the point where the altitude from A intersects the base BC. Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude AD also bisects the base, so BD = CD = 6 cm.\n\nNow we have two right triangles, ABD and ADC, both with hypotenuse AD and one leg of length 6 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude AD.\n\nIn right triangle ABD,\nAD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2\n\nLet AD = h (the altitude we want to find), then:\nh^2 + 6^2 = 7^2\nh^2 + 36 = 49\nh^2 = 49 - 36\nh^2 = 13\n\nNow take the square root of both sides:\nh = √13\n\nSo the length of the altitude to the base is √13 cm, or approximately 3.61 cm."
