    "message_1": "Let's say we have two algebraic equations: \n\nx^3 + y^3 - 3xy = 0 \n\nand \n\n2x^3 - 2y^3 - 5x + 5y = 0 \n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, find the number of intersection points between these two curves in the plane.",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points between two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are counted with their multiplicities.\n\nThe first equation, x^3 + y^3 - 3xy = 0, is a curve of degree 3 because the highest degree term is x^3 or y^3.\n\nThe second equation, 2x^3 - 2y^3 - 5x + 5y = 0, is also a curve of degree 3 because the highest degree term is 2x^3 or -2y^3.\n\nSince both curves have degree 3, Bezout's theorem tells us that the number of intersection points between these two curves in the plane is 3 * 3 = 9, assuming that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are counted with their multiplicities."
