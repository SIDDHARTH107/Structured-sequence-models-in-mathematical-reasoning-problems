The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = 4cos(3x)\ndy/dx = d(4cos(3x))/dx\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the outer function (4cos(u)) with respect to u, where u = 3x:\n\nd(4cos(u))/du = -4sin(u)\n\nNow, find the derivative of the inner function (3x) with respect to x:\n\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, apply the chain rule by multiplying the derivatives of the outer and inner functions:\n\ndy/dx = (-4sin(u)) * (3)\ndy/dx = -12sin(3x)\n\nNow, we want to find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx = -12sin(3(π/6))\ndy/dx = -12sin(π/2)\n\nSince sin(π/2) = 1, the derivative at x = π/6 is:\n\ndy/dx = -12(1)\ndy/dx = -12"
