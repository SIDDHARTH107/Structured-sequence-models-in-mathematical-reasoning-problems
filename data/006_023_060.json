    "message_1": "A market research study found that in a given population, 60% of consumers prefer to buy product A over product B. If a sample of 200 consumers is taken from this population, what is the probability that 120 or more would prefer product A over product B?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, consumers preferring product A) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the preference for product A, which is 60% or 0.6)\n- n is the sample size (200 consumers)\n- k is the number of successes we're interested in (120 or more)\n\nSince we want the probability of 120 or more consumers preferring product A, we need to calculate the cumulative probability for k = 120, 121, ..., 200. Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\nP(X ≥ 120) = P(X = 120) + P(X = 121) + ... + P(X = 200)\n\nCalculating this by hand would be tedious, so we can use a cumulative binomial probability calculator or statistical software to find the answer.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nP(X ≥ 120) ≈ 0.5584\n\nSo, the probability that 120 or more consumers in the sample of 200 would prefer product A over product B is approximately 55.84%."
