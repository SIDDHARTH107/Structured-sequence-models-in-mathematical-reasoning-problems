    "message_1": "Two prisoners A and B are held in separate cells, unable to communicate with each other. They are each given the option to confess or remain silent. If both prisoners remain silent, they will each serve a shorter sentence of 1 year. If both confess, they will each serve a longer sentence of 3 years. If one confesses and the other remains silent, the one who confesses will go free and the other will serve a longer sentence of 5 years. \n\nWhat is the best strategy for prisoner A if they know that prisoner B will remain silent?",
