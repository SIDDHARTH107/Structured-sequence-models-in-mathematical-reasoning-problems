    "message_2": "To find the exact value of cos(225°), we can first convert the angle to radians. \n\n225° × (π/180) = (5π/4) radians\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle to find the cosine value. The angle 5π/4 radians is in the third quadrant, where both cosine and sine are negative. We can find the reference angle (the angle between the terminal side of the angle and the negative x-axis) by subtracting π from 5π/4:\n\nReference angle = 5π/4 - π = π/4\n\nNow, we can find the cosine value for the reference angle π/4:\n\ncos(π/4) = √2 / 2\n\nSince the angle 5π/4 is in the third quadrant, where cosine is negative, the exact value of cos(225°) is:\n\ncos(225°) = -√2 / 2"
