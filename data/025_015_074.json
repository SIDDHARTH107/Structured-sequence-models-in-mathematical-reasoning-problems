    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane passing through the intersection of the two surfaces, we can first solve for one of the variables in the linear equation and substitute it into the quadratic equation.\n\nFrom the linear equation x + y + z = 0, we can solve for z:\n\nz = -x - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z into the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + (-x - y)^2 = 4\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy = 4\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + xy = 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in the form ax + by + cz + d = 0 by moving the constant term to the other side:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + xy - 2 = 0\n\nThis equation represents the plane passing through the intersection of the two surfaces."
