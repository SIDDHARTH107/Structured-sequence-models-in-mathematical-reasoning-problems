The perimeter increases with each iteration, and the formula for finding the perimeter after n iterations is given by P = 4(3^(n-1))s, where s is the initial side length.)",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration, we can use the formula P = 4(3^(n-1))s, where n is the number of iterations and s is the initial side length.\n\nIn this case, n = 4 and s = 10 cm.\n\nP = 4(3^(4-1)) * 10\nP = 4(3^3) * 10\nP = 4(27) * 10\nP = 108 * 10\nP = 1080 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration is 1080 cm."
