    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides with lengths of 3 and 5 units, and an included angle of 60 degrees. Find the perimeter of the triangle using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have a = 3, b = 5, and C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n60 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 3² + 5² - 2 * 3 * 5 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 9 + 25 - 30 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 34 - 30 * (1/2) (since cos(π / 3) = 1/2)\nc² = 34 - 15\nc² = 19\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √19\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter by adding the lengths together:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 3 + 5 + √19\nPerimeter ≈ 3 + 5 + 4.36\nPerimeter ≈ 12.36 units"
