    "message_1": "A math student is given the moduli space $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{4,1}$ that consists of stable curves of genus $4$ with one marked point. They are asked to compute the dimension of this moduli space using the formula $d=3g-3+n$, where $g$ is the genus and $n$ is the number of marked points.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the moduli space $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{4,1}$, we can use the formula $d=3g-3+n$. In this case, the genus $g=4$ and the number of marked points $n=1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$d = 3(4) - 3 + 1$\n\n$d = 12 - 3 + 1$\n\n$d = 9 + 1$\n\n$d = 10$\n\nSo, the dimension of the moduli space $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{4,1}$ is $10$."
