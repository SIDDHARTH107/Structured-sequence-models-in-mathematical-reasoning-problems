A sample of 40 bulbs was taken, and the mean lifespan was found to be 9900 hours. Use the central limit theorem to calculate the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 9900 hours or less, given that the manufacturer's claim is true.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 9900 hours or less, we will use the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the manufacturer's claim, the population mean (μ) is 10,000 hours, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 500 hours. The sample size (n) is 40 bulbs, and the sample mean (x̄) is 9900 hours.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The standard error is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 500 / √40 ≈ 79.06\n\nNext, we will calculate the z-score, which represents how many standard errors away from the population mean our sample mean is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nz = (9900 - 10000) / 79.06 ≈ -1.27\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability of obtaining a z-score of -1.27 or less:\n\nP(Z ≤ -1.27) ≈ 0.102\n\nSo, the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 9900 hours or less, given that the manufacturer's claim is true, is approximately 10.2%."
