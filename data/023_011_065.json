    "message_1": "A signal y(t) can be expressed as the sum of two sinusoidal signals with frequencies of 2π and 4π respectively. Using the Fourier transform, determine the amplitude and phase angle of each sinusoidal component if the peak value of y(t) is 6 and the signal starts at t=0.",
    "message_2": "Let the two sinusoidal signals be represented as:\n\ny1(t) = A1 * sin(2πt + φ1)\ny2(t) = A2 * sin(4πt + φ2)\n\nThe given signal y(t) is the sum of these two signals:\n\ny(t) = y1(t) + y2(t) = A1 * sin(2πt + φ1) + A2 * sin(4πt + φ2)\n\nWe are given that the peak value of y(t) is 6 and the signal starts at t=0. Let's use this information to find the amplitudes and phase angles of the sinusoidal components.\n\nAt t=0, we have:\n\ny(0) = A1 * sin(φ1) + A2 * sin(φ2)\n\nSince y(t) has a peak value of 6, we can write:\n\n6 = A1 * sin(φ1) + A2 * sin(φ2)  (1)\n\nNow, we need another equation to solve for the unknowns A1, A2, φ1, and φ2. We can differentiate y(t) with respect to t and find the value at t=0:\n\ndy/dt = 2πA1 * cos(2πt + φ1) + 4πA2 * cos(4πt + φ2)\n\nAt t=0, we have:\n\ndy/dt(0) = 2πA1 * cos(φ1) + 4πA2 * cos(φ2)\n\nSince y(t) has a peak value at t=0, the derivative at that point should be 0:\n\n0 = 2πA1 * cos(φ1) + 4πA2 * cos(φ2)  (2)\n\nNow we have two equations (1) and (2) with four unknowns A1, A2, φ1, and φ2. Unfortunately, we cannot uniquely determine the amplitude and phase angle of each sinusoidal component with the given information. We need more information or constraints to solve for the unknowns."
