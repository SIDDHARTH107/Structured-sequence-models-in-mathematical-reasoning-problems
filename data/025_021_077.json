The Euler characteristic is given by the formula:\n\nχ = Σ(-1)^(p+q) * h^(p,q)\n\nFor Mirror manifold 1:\n\nχ₁ = 1 - 0 + 1 - 1 + 2 - 1 + 1 - 0 + 1 - 0 + 0 - 0 + 1\nχ₁ = 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nFor Mirror manifold 2:\n\nχ₂ = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 2 - 1 + 1 - 3 + 3 - 1 + 4 - 6 + 4 - 1\nχ₂ = 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 + 4 = -2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of Mirror manifold 1 is 3, and the Euler characteristic of Mirror manifold 2 is -2."
