    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a 2-dimensional manifold with metric $ds^{2}= dx^{2}+dy^{2}$. Determine the Ricci curvature of $M$ if the sectional curvature of any two-dimensional plane in $M$ is equal to $k$, where $k$ is a constant.",
    "message_2": "To determine the Ricci curvature of the 2-dimensional manifold $M$, we first need to compute the Riemann curvature tensor. In 2-dimensional manifolds, the Riemann curvature tensor has only one independent component, which can be expressed in terms of the Gaussian curvature $K$. The Gaussian curvature is equal to the sectional curvature in 2-dimensional manifolds, so we have $K = k$.\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor in 2-dimensional manifolds can be written as:\n\n$R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$\n\nwhere $g_{ij}$ is the metric tensor, and in our case, it is given by:\n\n$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we can compute the Ricci curvature tensor $R_{ij}$ by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor:\n\n$R_{ij} = R^k_{ikj} = g^{kl}R_{iklj}$\n\nUsing the expression for the Riemann curvature tensor and the metric tensor, we get:\n\n$R_{ij} = K(g^{kl}(g_{ik}g_{lj} - g_{il}g_{jk}))$\n\nSince the metric tensor is the identity matrix, its inverse is also the identity matrix:\n\n$g^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThus, we can compute the Ricci curvature tensor components:\n\n$R_{11} = K(g^{22}(g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21})) = K(1(1 - 0)) = K$\n\n$R_{12} = K(g^{21}(g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21})) = K(0(1 - 0)) = 0$\n\n$R_{21} = K(g^{12}(g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21})) = K(0(1 - 0)) = 0$\n\n$R_{22} = K(g^{11}(g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21})) = K(1(1 - 0)) = K$\n\nSo, the Ricci curvature tensor is given by:\n\n$R_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} K & 0 \\\\ 0 & K \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSince the sectional curvature is constant, the Ricci curvature tensor is proportional to the metric tensor with the proportionality constant equal to the sectional curvature $k$."
