    "message_2": "To determine if the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x+1}{x-3}$ is continuous at $x=3$, we need to check if the limit exists at that point.\n\nThe limit of a function as $x$ approaches a point $a$ is defined as:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)$$\n\nIn this case, we want to find the limit as $x$ approaches $3$:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 3} \\frac{2x+1}{x-3}$$\n\nHowever, when we plug in $x=3$ into the function, we get:\n\n$$f(3) = \\frac{2(3)+1}{3-3} = \\frac{7}{0}$$\n\nSince division by zero is undefined, the limit does not exist at $x=3$. Therefore, the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x+1}{x-3}$ is not continuous at $x=3$."
