    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a network that had previously experienced 2 DDoS attacks within the past week, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (DDoS attacks) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (a DDoS attack) on any given day (0.4)\n- n is the number of trials (days in a week, which is 7)\n- k is the number of successes (DDoS attacks, which is 2)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(7, 2), which is the number of combinations of 7 items taken 2 at a time:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!)\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!)\nC(7, 2) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\nC(7, 2) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(7, 2) * p^2 * (1-p)^(7-2)\nP(X = 2) = 21 * (0.4)^2 * (1-0.4)^(7-2)\nP(X = 2) = 21 * (0.16) * (0.6)^5\nP(X = 2) = 21 * (0.16) * (0.07776)\nP(X = 2) = 21 * 0.0124416\nP(X = 2) â‰ˆ 0.261\n\nSo, the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a network that had previously experienced 2 DDoS attacks within the past week is approximately 0.26 or 26%."
