    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x(2-x) over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, we first need to extend the function to be periodic over the entire real line. Since the given interval has a length of 2, we will consider a periodic extension with period 2. Let's denote the extended function as g(x).\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series of g(x) using the Fourier coefficients. For a function with period 2L (in our case, L=1), the Fourier series is given by:\n\ng(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/2L) * ∫[g(x) dx] over the interval [-L, L]\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[g(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] over the interval [-L, L]\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[g(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] over the interval [-L, L]\n\nFor our function g(x) and interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[x(2-x) dx] from 0 to 2\na_n = (1/1) * ∫[x(2-x) * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[x(2-x) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nLet's compute the coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[x(2-x) dx] from 0 to 2\na_0 = (1/2) * [(2x^2/2 - x^3/3) evaluated from 0 to 2]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(4 - 8/3) - (0)]\na_0 = (1/2) * (4/3)\na_0 = 2/3\n\nNow, let's compute a_n:\n\na_n = ∫[x(2-x) * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice.\n\nLet u = x(2-x) and dv = cos(nπx) dx\nThen, du = (2 - 2x) dx and v = (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\na_n = [(1/nπ) * x(2-x) * sin(nπx)] from 0 to 2 - (1/nπ) * ∫[(2 - 2x) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nNow, let's compute the remaining integral using integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = (2 - 2x) and dv = sin(nπx) dx\nThen, du = -2 dx and v = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n∫[(2 - 2x) * sin(nπx) dx] = -(2 - 2x) * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx) - ∫[-2 * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx) dx]\n= -(2 - 2x) * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx) + (2/nπ) * ∫[cos(nπx) dx]\n\nNow, integrate the remaining integral:\n∫[cos(nπx) dx] = (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)\n\nSo, the remaining integral becomes:\n(2/nπ) * ∫[cos(nπx) dx] = (2/n²π²) * sin(nπx)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for a_n:\na_n = [(1/nπ) * x(2-x) * sin(nπx)] from 0 to 2 - (1/nπ) * [(2 - 2x) * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx) + (2/n²π²) * sin(nπx)] from 0 to 2\n\nEvaluate the expression at the limits:\na_n = 0 - (1/nπ) * [0 + 0]\na_n = 0\n\nNow, let's compute b_n:\n\nb_n = ∫[x(2-x) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice, similar to the process for a_n.\n\nLet u = x(2-x) and dv = sin(nπx) dx\nThen, du = (2 - 2x) dx and v = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\nb_n = [-(1/nπ) * x(2-x) * cos(nπx)] from 0 to 2 + (1/nπ) * ∫[(2 - 2x) * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nNow, let's compute the remaining integral using integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = (2 - 2x) and dv = cos(nπx) dx\nThen, du = -2 dx and v = (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n∫[(2 - 2x) * cos(nπx) dx] = (2 - 2x) * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - ∫[-2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) dx]\n= (2 - 2x) * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) + (2/nπ) * ∫[sin(nπx) dx]\n\nNow, integrate the remaining integral:\n∫[sin(nπx) dx] = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nSo, the remaining integral becomes:\n(2/nπ) * ∫[sin(nπx) dx] = -(2/n²π²) * cos(nπx)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for b_n:\nb_n = [-(1/nπ) * x(2-x) * cos(nπx)] from 0 to 2 + (1/nπ) * [(2 - 2x) * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - (2/n²π²) * cos(nπx)] from 0 to 2\n\nEvaluate the expression at the limits:\nb_n = [-(1/nπ) * 2 * (0) * cos(2nπ) + (1/nπ) * (2/n²π²) * cos(2nπ)] - [-(1/nπ) * 0 * cos(0) + (1/nπ) * (2/n²π²) * cos(0)]\nb_n = (1/nπ) * (2/n²π²) * (cos(2nπ) - 1)\n\nSince a_n = 0 for all n, the Fourier series of g(x) is given by:\n\ng(x) = a_0 + Σ[b_n * sin(nπx)]\ng(x) = 2/3 + Σ[((1/nπ) * (2/n²π²) * (cos(2nπ) - 1)) * sin(nπx)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x(2-x) over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2."
