    "message_1": "A company has 100 employees, and the probability of an employee committing financial fraud is 0.1. What is the probability that at least 10 employees will commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 10 employees committing financial fraud, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, we want to find the probability of at least 10 employees committing fraud, so we will find the probability of 9 or fewer employees committing fraud and subtract that from 1.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of exactly k employees committing fraud:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of employees (100), k is the number of employees committing fraud, p is the probability of an employee committing fraud (0.1), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe will calculate the probability of 0 to 9 employees committing fraud and sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ [C(100, k) * 0.1^k * (1-0.1)^(100-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability of at least 10 employees committing fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum and subtract it from 1, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) ≈ 0.7496\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 employees will commit financial fraud is approximately 74.96%."
