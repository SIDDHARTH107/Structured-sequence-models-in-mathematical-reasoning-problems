    "message_2": "To find the boat's true speed and direction, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry. Let's represent the boat's speed due east as vector A and the current of water flowing due north as vector B.\n\nVector A = 25 km/h (due east)\nVector B = 8 km/h (due north)\n\nThe boat's true speed (vector C) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nC^2 = A^2 + B^2\nC^2 = (25 km/h)^2 + (8 km/h)^2\nC^2 = 625 + 64\nC^2 = 689\nC = √689\nC ≈ 26.25 km/h\n\nNow, let's find the boat's true direction. We can use the tangent function to find the angle θ between the boat's true velocity vector and the due east direction:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(θ) = B / A\ntan(θ) = 8 km/h / 25 km/h\nθ = arctan(8/25)\nθ ≈ 17.46° (north of east)\n\nSo, the boat's true speed is approximately 26.25 km/h, and its true direction is approximately 17.46° north of east.\n\nNow, let's find the projection of the boat's velocity vector onto the due north direction. We can use the dot product formula for this:\n\nProjection = |C| * cos(θ)\n\nSince we already have the angle θ, we can find the projection:\n\nProjection = 26.25 km/h * cos(17.46°)\nProjection ≈ 26.25 km/h * 0.955\nProjection ≈ 25.07 km/h\n\nThe projection of the boat's velocity vector onto the due north direction is approximately 25.07 km/h."
