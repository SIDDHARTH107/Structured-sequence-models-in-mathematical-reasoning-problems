    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products A and B. A single unit of A requires 2 units of labor and 3 units of raw material, whereas a single unit of B requires 4 units of labor and 1 unit of raw material. The company has 10 units of labor and 12 units of raw material available. The profit for each unit of A is $300 and for each unit of B is $250. The company wants to know how many units of A and B they should produce to maximize their profit given the available resources.\n\nPlease write out the linear programming problem and find the optimal production plan (number of units of A and B to be produced).",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 300x + 250y\n\nConstraints (based on available resources):\n2x + 4y ≤ 10 (labor constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 12 (raw material constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then find the vertices of the feasible region to determine the optimal production plan.\n\nGraphing the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 10\nDivide by 2: x + 2y ≤ 5\ny ≤ (5 - x) / 2\n\n2. Raw material constraint: 3x + y ≤ 12\ny ≤ 12 - 3x\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 5), (2, 3), and (4, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 300x + 250y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 300(0) + 250(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 5) = 300(0) + 250(5) = $1,250\n3. P(2, 3) = 300(2) + 250(3) = $1,350\n4. P(4, 0) = 300(4) + 250(0) = $1,200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (2, 3), with a profit of $1,350.\n\nSo, the optimal production plan is to produce 2 units of product A and 3 units of product B to maximize the profit."
