    "message_2": "To find the expected number of defective phone cases produced per day, you can multiply the total number of cases produced per day by the probability of a case being defective:\n\nExpected number of defective cases = (Total number of cases produced per day) × (Probability of a case being defective)\n\nExpected number of defective cases = 9,000 × 0.03\n\nExpected number of defective cases = 270\n\nSo, the expected number of defective phone cases produced per day is 270."
