    "message_1": "Consider a projective algebraic curve $C$ defined by the equation $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$, with $\\lambda \\neq 0,1$. Let $\\mathcal{O}_C(1)$ denote the line bundle on $C$ associated to the divisor class of a hyperplane section. Compute the dimension $H^1(C,\\mathcal{O}_C(1))$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(1))$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have\n\n$$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g,$$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ denotes the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of $D$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nIn our case, we are interested in the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(1)$, which corresponds to the divisor $D = H \\cap C$, where $H$ is a hyperplane. Since $C$ is a plane curve of degree 3, we have $\\deg(D) = 3$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. The genus can be computed using the formula\n\n$$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2},$$\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, $d = 3$, so we have\n\n$$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1.$$\n\nNext, we need to compute the canonical divisor $K_C$. For a plane curve of degree $d$, the canonical divisor is given by\n\n$$K_C = (d-3)H.$$\n\nIn our case, we have\n\n$$K_C = (3-3)H = 0H.$$\n\nNow, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g.$$\n\nSince $K_C = 0H$, we have $K_C - D = -D$, and thus\n\n$$l(D) - l(-D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g.$$\n\nSince $D$ has degree 3, the divisor $-D$ has degree $-3$, and thus $l(-D) = 0$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$l(D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g = 3 + 1 - 1 = 3.$$\n\nFinally, we have\n\n$$H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(1)) = l(D) = 3.$$"
