    "message_2": "To find the probability of an employee getting injured in a workplace accident in a year, we need to first find the average number of accidents per year and then divide that by the number of employees.\n\nThe workplace has a history of 10 accidents in the past 5 years. To find the average number of accidents per year, we can divide the total number of accidents by the number of years:\n\n10 accidents / 5 years = 2 accidents per year\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of an employee getting injured in a workplace accident in a year. There are currently 40 employees working in the workplace. To find the probability, we can divide the average number of accidents per year by the number of employees:\n\n2 accidents per year / 40 employees = 0.05\n\nSo, the probability of an employee getting injured in a workplace accident in a year is 0.05 or 5%."
