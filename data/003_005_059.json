    "message_2": "Let's call the non-right angle adjacent to the adjacent side θ. We are given the adjacent side (4) and the hypotenuse (6) of the right triangle. We can use the cosine function to find the angle θ.\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(θ) = 4 / 6\ncos(θ) = 2/3\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ whose cosine is 2/3. We can use the inverse cosine function (also known as arccos) to find this angle.\n\nθ = arccos(2/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 48.19°\n\nSo, the non-right angle adjacent to the adjacent side is approximately 48.19°."
