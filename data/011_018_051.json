    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve based on block designs:\n\nSuppose you are designing a survey that includes questions on 3 different topics: sports, music, and art. You want to randomly assign each question to a specific topic to ensure that each topic has an equal number of questions. If you have 9 questions in total, how many different ways are there to assign the questions to the topics using a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) with 3 blocks and 3 items per block?",
    "message_2": "A balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is a combinatorial design with the following properties:\n\n1. There are v distinct items.\n2. There are b blocks (subsets) of items.\n3. Each block contains k items.\n4. Each item appears in r different blocks.\n5. Every pair of distinct items appears together in λ blocks.\n\nIn this problem, we have v = 9 questions, b = 3 blocks, and k = 3 items per block. We want to find the number of ways to assign the questions to the topics using a BIBD.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of r. Since each topic has an equal number of questions, we can divide the total number of questions by the number of topics:\n\nr = v / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3\n\nSo, each question appears in 3 different blocks.\n\nNext, we need to find the value of λ. We can use the following formula for BIBD:\n\nλ(v - 1) = r(k - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nλ(9 - 1) = 3(3 - 1)\nλ(8) = 6\nλ = 6 / 8 = 3 / 4\n\nSince λ must be an integer, there is no balanced incomplete block design for this problem. Therefore, there are 0 ways to assign the questions to the topics using a BIBD with 3 blocks and 3 items per block."
