    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean for a large enough sample size (n) will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 70 inches, the population standard deviation (σ) is 3 inches, and the sample size (n) is 36.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is:\nμ_sample_mean = μ = 70 inches\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is:\nσ_sample_mean = σ / sqrt(n) = 3 / sqrt(36) = 3 / 6 = 0.5 inches\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 69 inches. To do this, we will use the z-score formula to standardize the value of 69 inches:\n\nz = (X - μ_sample_mean) / σ_sample_mean = (69 - 70) / 0.5 = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -1. We can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find this probability. Looking up the value for a z-score of -1, we find that the probability is approximately 0.1587.\n\nSo, the probability that the mean height of a random sample of 36 male students is less than 69 inches is approximately 15.87%."
