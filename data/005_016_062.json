    "message_1": "Suppose a high school math teacher wants to predict which of their students will pass the final exam based on their performance on two midterm exams. They have data for 50 students, with 25 students who passed the final exam and 25 who failed. The teacher wants to perform a discriminant analysis to determine whether the two midterm exam scores can accurately predict which students will pass the final exam. Using the given data, what is the overall percent of correctly classified students if the teacher uses the discriminant function to predict the final exam outcomes?",
    "message_2": "To determine the overall percent of correctly classified students using the discriminant function, we would need the actual data for the two midterm exam scores and the final exam outcomes. However, since the data is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact percentage of correctly classified students.\n\nIf you can provide the data for the two midterm exam scores and the final exam outcomes, I would be happy to help you perform the discriminant analysis and calculate the overall percent of correctly classified students."
