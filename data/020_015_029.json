    "message_2": "To maximize the enclosed area of the rectangular garden, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and the concept of optimization.\n\nLet the length of the garden be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter P of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 300 meters of fencing material, the perimeter is 300 meters:\n\n300 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to express either L or W in terms of the other variable. Let's solve for W:\n\nW = (300 - 2L) / 2\nW = 150 - L\n\nThe area A of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nA = L * W\n\nSubstitute the expression for W in terms of L:\n\nA = L * (150 - L)\n\nNow, we have the area A in terms of L:\n\nA = 150L - L^2\n\nTo maximize the area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to L and setting it to zero:\n\ndA/dL = 150 - 2L\n\nSetting dA/dL to zero:\n\n0 = 150 - 2L\n2L = 150\nL = 75\n\nNow, we can find the width W using the expression we derived earlier:\n\nW = 150 - L\nW = 150 - 75\nW = 75\n\nSo, to maximize the enclosed area, the length and width of the garden should both be 75 meters. The maximum enclosed area is:\n\nA = L * W\nA = 75 * 75\nA = 5625 square meters"
