The fixed cost to produce the product is $50, and the variable cost is $5 per unit. The demand function for the product is given by Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the quantity sold and P is the price in dollars. What is the optimal price that will maximize the retailer's revenue on this product, and what is the maximum revenue that the retailer can earn?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize the retailer's revenue, we first need to find the revenue function. Revenue (R) is the product of the price (P) and the quantity sold (Q). Using the demand function, we can express the revenue function as:\n\nR(P) = P * Q = P * (100 - 2P)\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum point of this function. To do this, we can find the first derivative of the revenue function with respect to P and set it equal to 0:\n\ndR/dP = d(P * (100 - 2P))/dP\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\ndR/dP = (100 - 2P) + P * (-2) = 100 - 4P\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for P:\n\n0 = 100 - 4P\n4P = 100\nP = 25\n\nThe optimal price to maximize the retailer's revenue is $25. Now, we need to find the maximum revenue. We can do this by plugging the optimal price back into the revenue function:\n\nR(25) = 25 * (100 - 2 * 25) = 25 * 50 = 1250\n\nThe maximum revenue that the retailer can earn is $1,250.\n\nHowever, this is the maximum revenue, not the maximum profit. To find the maximum profit, we need to consider the fixed and variable costs. The total cost function is given by:\n\nC(Q) = 50 + 5Q\n\nUsing the demand function, we can express the total cost function in terms of P:\n\nC(P) = 50 + 5(100 - 2P) = 50 + 500 - 10P\n\nNow, we can find the profit function by subtracting the total cost function from the revenue function:\n\nProfit(P) = R(P) - C(P) = (P * (100 - 2P)) - (50 + 500 - 10P)\n\nNow, plug in the optimal price P = 25:\n\nProfit(25) = (25 * (100 - 2 * 25)) - (50 + 500 - 10 * 25) = 1250 - (550 - 250) = 1250 - 300 = 950\n\nThe maximum profit that the retailer can earn is $950."
