On the other hand, if G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3, then there is an element in G of order 2. Prove that every group of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3 by showing that every group of order 6 has an element of order 6 or an element of order 2.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 6. By Cauchy's theorem, there must be an element of order 2 or order 3 in G since 2 and 3 are prime divisors of 6. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 3.\nLet a be an element of order 3 in G, so a^3 = e (identity element). Now, consider the subgroup H generated by a, H = {e, a, a^2}. Since the order of H is 3, and 3 is prime, H is a cyclic group. Moreover, H is a normal subgroup of G since the index of H in G is 2 (|G|/|H| = 6/3 = 2). \n\nNow, let b be an element in G that is not in H. Since G has order 6, the order of b must be either 2 or 6. If the order of b is 6, then G is a cyclic group generated by b and isomorphic to C6. If the order of b is 2, then b^2 = e. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, we can consider the product of cosets bH = {b, ba, ba^2}. Notice that (ba)^2 = baba = (ba)^(-1) since b^2 = a^3 = e, so ba has order 2. Similarly, (ba^2)^2 = ba^2ba^2 = (ba^2)^(-1), so ba^2 also has order 2. Thus, G is generated by elements of order 2 and 3, and it is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nCase 2: G has an element of order 2.\nLet x be an element of order 2 in G, so x^2 = e. If G does not have an element of order 3, then all non-identity elements in G must have order 2. However, this would imply that G is an abelian group of order 6 with all non-identity elements having order 2, which is not possible since there is no such group. Therefore, G must have an element of order 3, and we are back to Case 1.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
