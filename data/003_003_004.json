    "message_2": "To find the value of sine of 60 degrees using the unit circle, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nOn the unit circle, the hypotenuse is always 1. So, we can scale down the 30-60-90 triangle to fit the unit circle by dividing each side by 2. This gives us the following side lengths:\n\n- Side opposite the 30-degree angle: 1/2\n- Side opposite the 60-degree angle: √3/2\n- Hypotenuse: 1\n\nNow, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the sine of 60 degrees is:\n\nsin(60°) = (√3/2) / 1 = √3/2\n\nSo, the value of sine of 60 degrees using the unit circle is √3/2."
