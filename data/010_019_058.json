    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology of X, we first need to find the critical points of the Morse function f and their indices. Then, we will compute the Morse complex and the boundary maps, and finally, we will compute the homology groups.\n\n1. Critical points and their indices:\n\nThe Morse function f(x) = (x1)^2 + ... + (xn)^2 has a unique critical point at x = (0, ..., 0), which is a global minimum. The Hessian matrix of f is given by:\n\nH(f) = 2 * diag(1, ..., 1) = 2 * I_n,\n\nwhere I_n is the identity matrix of size n. Since the Hessian is positive definite, the critical point is a non-degenerate minimum. The index of this critical point is 0, as there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\n2. Morse complex:\n\nSince there is only one critical point, the Morse complex is very simple:\n\nC_k = { Z if k = 0, 0 if k ≠ 0 },\n\nwhere Z denotes the integers.\n\n3. Boundary maps:\n\nThe boundary maps are given by:\n\n∂_k: C_k → C_(k-1).\n\nSince C_k = 0 for k ≠ 0, the only non-trivial boundary map is ∂_0: C_0 → C_(-1). However, C_(-1) = 0, so ∂_0 is the zero map.\n\n4. Homology groups:\n\nThe Morse homology groups are given by:\n\nH_k = ker(∂_k) / im(∂_(k+1)).\n\nFor k ≠ 0, we have:\n\nH_k = ker(∂_k) / im(∂_(k+1)) = 0 / 0 = 0.\n\nFor k = 0, we have:\n\nH_0 = ker(∂_0) / im(∂_1) = C_0 / 0 = Z.\n\nTherefore, the Morse homology of X is given by:\n\nH_k(X) = { Z if k = 0, 0 if k ≠ 0 }.\n\nThis result is consistent with the fact that X is a compact manifold of dimension n, and the Morse function f has a unique minimum with index 0. The homology groups indicate that X has a single connected component and no higher-dimensional holes."
