    "message_2": "To find the expected number of patients with the rare medical condition, we can multiply the probability of a person having the condition by the total number of patients in the hospital.\n\nExpected number of patients with the condition = Probability of having the condition × Total number of patients\nExpected number of patients with the condition = 0.05 × 300\nExpected number of patients with the condition = 15\n\nSo, the expected number of patients with the rare medical condition in the hospital is 15."
