    "message_2": "To determine if the statement is true or false, we will analyze it using the given conditions and the properties of integers and their squares.\n\nStatement: \"If x is an integer and x > 0, then x squared is also greater than 0.\"\n\nGiven: x is an integer and x > 0\n\nWe need to prove: x^2 > 0\n\nSince x is an integer and x > 0, x belongs to the set of positive integers (also known as natural numbers). Let's consider the properties of the square of a positive integer.\n\nProperty: The square of a positive integer is always positive.\n\nProof: Let x be a positive integer. Then, x^2 = x * x. Since x > 0, and the product of two positive numbers is always positive, x^2 is also positive.\n\nTherefore, if x is an integer and x > 0, then x^2 is also greater than 0. The statement is true."
