    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 17cm and one leg of length 8cm. What is the length of the other leg, rounded to two decimal places, using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we have the hypotenuse (c) as 17cm and one leg (a) as 8cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe can plug in the given values and solve for b:\n\n8^2 + b^2 = 17^2\n64 + b^2 = 289\n\nNow, we can subtract 64 from both sides of the equation:\n\nb^2 = 225\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), we take the square root of 225:\n\nb = √225\nb ≈ 15\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is approximately 15cm, rounded to two decimal places."
