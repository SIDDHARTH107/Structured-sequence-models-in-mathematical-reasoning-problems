Show that every group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. Find all of the non-abelian groups of order 32 and give an example of two non-isomorphic groups in this class.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 32, we will use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 32 = 2^5, we are looking for groups with a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of a group of order 32 must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. Let P be this normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nNow, we will use the fact that a group of order p^n, where p is prime, is a p-group, and the structure of p-groups is determined by their lower central series. The lower central series of a group G is defined as follows:\n\n1. G_1 = G\n2. G_i = [G, G_(i-1)] for i > 1\n\nThe lower central series eventually terminates at the trivial subgroup, and the length of the series determines the structure of the group. For a group of order 2^5, the longest possible lower central series is of length 6 (including the trivial subgroup).\n\nNow, we will consider the different possibilities for the lower central series of a group of order 32:\n\n1. Length 2: This corresponds to the cyclic group C32, which is abelian.\n2. Length 3: This corresponds to the dihedral group D16, which is non-abelian.\n3. Length 4, 5, or 6: These correspond to non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nWe have already found two isomorphism classes (C32 and D16). To find the remaining non-abelian groups, we will use the fact that the structure of a p-group is determined by its exponent-p central series. The exponent-p central series of a group G is defined as follows:\n\n1. G_1 = G\n2. G_i = G_(i-1)^p for i > 1\n\nFor a group of order 2^5, the longest possible exponent-2 central series is of length 6 (including the trivial subgroup). We will consider the different possibilities for the exponent-2 central series of a group of order 32:\n\n1. Length 2: This corresponds to the cyclic group C32, which is abelian.\n2. Length 3: This corresponds to the dihedral group D16, which is non-abelian.\n3. Length 4, 5, or 6: These correspond to non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nThus, there are six non-abelian groups of order 32, in addition to the cyclic group C32 and the dihedral group D16.\n\nTwo examples of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 32 are the quaternion group Q32 and the generalized quaternion group QD32. The quaternion group Q32 has presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩, while the generalized quaternion group QD32 has presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩. These groups are not isomorphic because they have different presentations and different orders of their generators."
