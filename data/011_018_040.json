    "message_1": "A company wants to carry out a survey of their employees, but they have limited resources to conduct the survey. They want to use a block design to survey their employees. If they have 80 employees, and want to use blocks of size 4, how many blocks are needed to conduct the survey?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of blocks needed to conduct the survey, we need to divide the total number of employees by the size of each block.\n\nNumber of blocks = Total number of employees / Size of each block\n\nNumber of blocks = 80 employees / 4 employees per block\n\nNumber of blocks = 20\n\nSo, the company needs 20 blocks to conduct the survey."
