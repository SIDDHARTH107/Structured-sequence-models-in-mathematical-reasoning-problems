    "message_2": "First, let's clarify that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over union. However, since you are asked to find (A x B) ∪ (A x B), we can still solve this problem.\n\nGiven sets A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}, let's find the Cartesian product A x B:\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A x B) and (A x B):\n\n(A x B) ∪ (A x B) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nThe union of (A x B) and (A x B) is simply the same set as (A x B) since both sets have the same elements:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (A x B) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}"
