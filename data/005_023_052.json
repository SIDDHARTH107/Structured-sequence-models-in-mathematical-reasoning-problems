    "message_2": "To identify the outlier(s), we can calculate the mean and standard deviation of the given weights and then check if any weight is more than two standard deviations away from the mean.\n\nMean = (80 + 82 + 83 + 86 + 87 + 88 + 90 + 91 + 92 + 200) / 10 = 979 / 10 = 97.9\n\nNow, let's calculate the variance and standard deviation:\n\nVariance = [(80 - 97.9)^2 + (82 - 97.9)^2 + (83 - 97.9)^2 + (86 - 97.9)^2 + (87 - 97.9)^2 + (88 - 97.9)^2 + (90 - 97.9)^2 + (91 - 97.9)^2 + (92 - 97.9)^2 + (200 - 97.9)^2] / 10\n\nVariance ≈ 1118.69\n\nStandard Deviation = √1118.69 ≈ 33.44\n\nNow, let's check for outliers (values more than two standard deviations away from the mean):\n\n80 is within two standard deviations: 97.9 - 2 * 33.44 = 31.02\n82 is within two standard deviations\n83 is within two standard deviations\n86 is within two standard deviations\n87 is within two standard deviations\n88 is within two standard deviations\n90 is within two standard deviations\n91 is within two standard deviations\n92 is within two standard deviations\n200 is outside two standard deviations: 97.9 + 2 * 33.44 = 164.78\n\nSo, the outlier is 200.\n\nNow, let's find the new mean weight after removing the outlier:\n\nNew Mean = (80 + 82 + 83 + 86 + 87 + 88 + 90 + 91 + 92) / 9 = 779 / 9 ≈ 86.56\n\nThe new mean weight of the apples after removing the outlier is approximately 86.56 grams."
