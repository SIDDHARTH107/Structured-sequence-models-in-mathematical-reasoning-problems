    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle is given by the formula P = 2πr, where P is the perimeter and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the garden is 10 meters, the radius is half of that, which is 5 meters.\n\nP = 2πr\nP = 2π(5)\nP = 10π\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is 10π meters, which is approximately 31.42 meters."
