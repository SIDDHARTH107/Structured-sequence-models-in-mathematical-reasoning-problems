Let $C$ be the set of all points in $X$ that lie in a connected subset containing at least one point of both $A$ and $B$. If $A$ has 4 connected components and $B$ has 3 connected components, what is the maximum possible number of connected components of $C$?",
    "message_2": "Let $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ be the connected components of $A$, and $B_1, B_2, B_3$ be the connected components of $B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, each connected component of $A$ is disjoint from each connected component of $B$. \n\nNow, consider the connected components of $C$. For each connected component of $C$, there must be at least one point from $A$ and one point from $B$. Let's try to maximize the number of connected components of $C$ by connecting each connected component of $A$ to a connected component of $B$.\n\nWe can connect $A_1$ to $B_1$, $A_2$ to $B_2$, $A_3$ to $B_3$, and $A_4$ to $B_1$ (or any other connected component of $B$). In this way, we have created 4 connected components of $C$, each containing at least one point from $A$ and one point from $B$. \n\nNow, let's see if we can create more connected components of $C$. Suppose there is another connected component of $C$, say $C_5$. Since $C_5$ must contain at least one point from $A$ and one point from $B$, without loss of generality, let's say it contains a point from $A_1$ and a point from $B_1$. But this would mean that $A_1$ and $B_1$ are connected through both $C_1$ and $C_5$, which contradicts the fact that $C_1$ and $C_5$ are distinct connected components. Therefore, we cannot create more connected components of $C$.\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of connected components of $C$ is 4."
