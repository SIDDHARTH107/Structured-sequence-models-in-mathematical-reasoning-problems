    "message_1": "Consider a Morse-Smale complex with 6 critical points, where 2 are local minima and 1 is a local maximum. If the Morse-Smale complex has exactly 3 index-1 critical points, how many index-2 critical points does it have?",
    "message_2": "A Morse-Smale complex with 6 critical points can be represented by the sum of the number of critical points of each index. Let's denote the number of index-0 (local minima), index-1, index-2, and index-3 (local maxima) critical points as n0, n1, n2, and n3, respectively.\n\nWe are given that n0 = 2 (local minima), n1 = 3 (index-1 critical points), and n3 = 1 (local maximum). We want to find the number of index-2 critical points, n2.\n\nSince there are a total of 6 critical points, we can write the equation:\n\nn0 + n1 + n2 + n3 = 6\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n2 + 3 + n2 + 1 = 6\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n6 + n2 = 6\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides:\n\nn2 = 0\n\nSo, there are 0 index-2 critical points in the Morse-Smale complex."
