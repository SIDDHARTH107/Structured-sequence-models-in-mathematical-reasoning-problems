Therefore, the first term of the integral will be zero. The second term, however, will not be zero:\n\na_n = (1/(2π)) * [(1/(n^2ω^2)) * cos(nωt)] from -π to π\na_n = (1/(2π)) * [(1/(n^2ω^2)) * (cos(nπ) - cos(-nπ))]\na_n = (1/(2π)) * [(1/(n^2ω^2)) * 2 * cos(nπ)]\na_n = (1/(n^2ω^2)) * cos(nπ)\n\nSince ω = 2π/T and T = 2π, ω = 1:\n\na_n = (1/(n^2)) * cos(nπ)\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt) * dt] from -π to π\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * ∫[t * sin(nωt) * dt] from -π to π\n\nUsing the same integration by parts method as before:\n\n∫[t * sin(nωt) * dt] = -t * (1/(nω)) * cos(nωt) - (1/(n^2ω^2)) * sin(nωt)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral from -π to π:\n\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * [-t * (1/(nω)) * cos(nωt) - (1/(n^2ω^2)) * sin(nωt)] from -π to π\n\nThe second term of the integral will be zero since sin(nωt) is an odd function. The first term will not be zero:\n\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * [-t * (1/(nω)) * cos(nωt)] from -π to π\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * [(-π/(nω)) * cos(nπ) - (-π/(nω)) * cos(-nπ)]\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * [(-π/(nω)) * 2 * cos(nπ)]\nb_n = (-π/(nω)) * cos(nπ)\n\nSince ω = 1:\n\nb_n = (-π/n) * cos(nπ)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(t) = t:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nωt) + b_n * sin(nωt)]\nf(t) = 0 + Σ[((1/(n^2)) * cos(nπ)) * cos(nωt) + ((-π/n) * cos(nπ)) * sin(nωt)]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n:\n\nf(t) = Σ[((1/(n^2)) * (-1)^n) * cos(nωt) - ((π/n) * (-1)^n) * sin(nωt)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(t) = t over the interval -π to π."
