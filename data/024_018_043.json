    "message_2": "To calculate the sectional curvature at the point P(1, 2, √2) on the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet the surface be parametrized by the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) as follows:\nx = r * sin(θ) * cos(φ)\ny = r * sin(θ) * sin(φ)\nz = r * cos(θ)\n\nSince the surface is given by x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9, we have r = 3.\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form:\nE = <ru, ru> = 9 * (sin^2(θ) * cos^2(φ) + sin^2(θ) * sin^2(φ) + cos^2(θ)) = 9\nF = <ru, rv> = 0 (since u and v are orthogonal in spherical coordinates)\nG = <rv, rv> = 9 * sin^2(θ)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the second derivatives of the surface with respect to the parameters u and v. We have:\nL = <ruu, N> = -3 * cos(θ)\nM = <ruv, N> = 0\nN = <rvv, N> = -3 * sin(θ) * cos(θ)\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface. At the point P(1, 2, √2), we have θ = arccos(√2/3) and φ = arctan(2).\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H using the formulas:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (-3 * cos(θ) * (-3 * sin(θ) * cos(θ))) / (9 * sin^2(θ)) = 1/3\nH = (LE + NG - 2MF) / (2(EG - F^2)) = (9 - 6 * cos(θ) * sin(θ)) / (18 * sin^2(θ))\n\nThe sectional curvature is given by the formula:\nK = 3H^2 - 3K\n\nPlugging in the values for K and H, we get:\nK = 3(1/3)^2 - 3(1/3) = 1/3 - 1 = -2/3\n\nTherefore, the sectional curvature at the point P(1, 2, √2) on the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 is -2/3."
