    "message_1": "A company hired a market research firm to conduct a survey to identify the shopping habits of their customers. The survey collected data on the amount of money each customer spent on different product categories (grocery, electronics, clothing, etc.) over the past year. The company wants to use cluster analysis to identify different groups of customers based on their spending habits.\n\nThe data collected by the market research firm can be represented as a matrix with 50 rows (representing customers) and 5 columns (representing product categories), where each entry represents the amount of money the corresponding customer spent on the corresponding product category.\n\nThe company wants to use k-means clustering to identify 3 groups of customers based on their spending habits. What is the means (rounded to the nearest cent) of the spending on electronics for the customers in the group that has the highest mean spending on electronics?",
    "message_2": "To provide the mean spending on electronics for the group with the highest mean spending on electronics, we would need the actual data matrix with the 50 rows and 5 columns. Without the data, it is impossible to perform the k-means clustering and calculate the mean spending for each group. Please provide the data matrix to proceed with the analysis."
