    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = [[3, 2, 4],\n     [2, 8, 2],\n     [4, 2, 6]]\n\nx = [[x],\n     [y],\n     [z]]\n\nb = [[14],\n     [28],\n     [20]]\n\nNow, let's perform the Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. We want to find a lower triangular matrix L such that A = LL^T, where L^T is the transpose of L.\n\nL = [[l11,  0,  0],\n     [l21, l22,  0],\n     [l31, l32, l33]]\n\nWe can find the elements of L using the following formulas:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1.732 ≈ 1.155\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 4 / 1.732 ≈ 2.309\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(8 - 1.155^2) ≈ 2.684\nl32 = (a32 - l21*l31) / l22 = (2 - 1.155*2.309) / 2.684 ≈ 0.258\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(6 - 2.309^2 - 0.258^2) ≈ 1.140\n\nSo, L ≈ [[1.732,  0,    0],\n          [1.155, 2.684,  0],\n          [2.309, 0.258, 1.140]]\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations using forward and backward substitution. First, let's solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\ny1 = b1 / l11 = 14 / 1.732 ≈ 8.082\ny2 = (b2 - l21*y1) / l22 = (28 - 1.155*8.082) / 2.684 ≈ 3.732\ny3 = (b3 - l31*y1 - l32*y2) / l33 = (20 - 2.309*8.082 - 0.258*3.732) / 1.140 ≈ -1.000\n\nSo, y ≈ [[8.082],\n          [3.732],\n          [-1.000]]\n\nNow, let's solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\nx3 = y3 / l33 = -1.000 / 1.140 ≈ -0.877\nx2 = (y2 - l32*x3) / l22 = (3.732 - 0.258*(-0.877)) / 2.684 ≈ 1.392\nx1 = (y1 - l21*x2 - l31*x3) / l11 = (8.082 - 1.155*1.392 - 2.309*(-0.877)) / 1.732 ≈ 2.000\n\nSo, x ≈ [[2.000],\n          [1.392],\n          [-0.877]]\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x = 2, y = 1.392, and z = -0.877."
