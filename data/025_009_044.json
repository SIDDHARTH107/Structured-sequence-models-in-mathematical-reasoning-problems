    "message_2": "The dimension of the moduli space M_g of algebraic curves of genus g can be found using the formula:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3\n\nwhere g is the genus of the algebraic curve. In this case, g = 3. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\ndim(M_3) = 3(3) - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the moduli space M_3 of algebraic curves of genus 3 is 6."
