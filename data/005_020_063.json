    "message_1": "A company claims that their dice rolls are fair and result in each number (1 through 6) being rolled with an equal probability of 1/6. To test this claim, a math student decides to run a Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 dice rolls using a computer program. How many times would they expect to see each number rolled if the company's claim is true?",
    "message_2": "If the company's claim is true and each number has an equal probability of 1/6, then in 10,000 dice rolls, we would expect each number to appear approximately 1/6 of the time.\n\nTo find the expected number of times each number would be rolled, we can multiply the total number of rolls (10,000) by the probability of rolling each number (1/6):\n\nExpected rolls for each number = (10,000) * (1/6) = 1,666.67\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a roll, we can round this to the nearest whole number:\n\nExpected rolls for each number â‰ˆ 1,667\n\nSo, if the company's claim is true, the math student would expect to see each number rolled approximately 1,667 times in their 10,000-roll Monte Carlo simulation."
