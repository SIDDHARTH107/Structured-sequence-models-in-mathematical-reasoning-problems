    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 35, we have |G| = 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are distinct prime numbers. By the Sylow Theorems, there exist Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G.\n\nLet n_5 and n_7 denote the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G, respectively. By the Sylow Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_7 divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFrom condition 1, the possible values for n_5 are 1 and 7. However, since n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5), we must have n_5 = 1. Similarly, from condition 2, we have n_7 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be the unique Sylow 7-subgroup of G. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7. Since P and Q are both cyclic (as they have prime order), we can write P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩ for some elements a and b in G.\n\nNow, since n_5 = n_7 = 1, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G (by Sylow's Theorem). Thus, we can consider the product PQ, which is a subgroup of G. Notice that |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have prime orders, their intersection can only be the identity element, so |P ∩ Q| = 1. Therefore, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nSince |PQ| = |G|, we have PQ = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively. In other words, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nAlternatively, if there exists an element c in G such that its order is 35, then G is a cyclic group generated by c, i.e., G = ⟨c⟩. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 35.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
