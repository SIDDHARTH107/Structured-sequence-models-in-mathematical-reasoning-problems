    "message_1": "Suppose that in a market, the probability of a consumer purchasing a product is 0.6, and the probability of a consumer recommending that product to a friend is 0.8. What is the probability that a consumer purchased the product and recommended it to a friend?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a consumer purchased the product and recommended it to a friend, we need to assume that these two events are independent. If they are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to find the probability of both events occurring.\n\nProbability of purchasing the product (P(A)) = 0.6\nProbability of recommending the product (P(B)) = 0.8\n\nProbability of purchasing and recommending the product (P(A and B)) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48\n\nSo, the probability that a consumer purchased the product and recommended it to a friend is 0.48 or 48%."
