Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the approximate solution of the system, we can use the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the variable vector, and b is the constant vector.\n\nFirst, let's write the system in matrix form:\n\nA = | 1  3 -1 |\n    | 2 -4  1 |\n    | 3  1  2 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  6.2  |\n    | -3.6  |\n    |  7.8  |\n\nNow, we can use the inverse of the coefficient matrix (A) to find the solution vector (x). The formula is x = A^(-1) * b.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of A. We can use the adjugate method to find the inverse:\n\n1. Find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 1(-8 - 2) - 3(4 - 3) + (-1)(-4 - 6) = -10 - 3(-1) + 10 = -10 + 3 + 10 = 3\n\n2. Find the matrix of minors:\n\nM = | -8 -2 |\n    |  4 -3 |\n    | -4  6 |\n\n3. Find the matrix of cofactors:\n\nC = | -8  2 |\n    | -4 -3 |\n    |  4  6 |\n\n4. Find the adjugate matrix:\n\nadj(A) = | -8 -4  4 |\n         |  2 -3  6 |\n         |  0  0  0 |\n\n5. Find the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A) = (1/3) * | -8 -4  4 |\n                                   |  2 -3  6 |\n                                   |  0  0  0 |\n\nNow, we can multiply A^(-1) by b to find the solution vector x:\n\nx = A^(-1) * b = (1/3) * | -8 -4  4 | * |  6.2  |\n                          |  2 -3  6 |   | -3.6  |\n                          |  0  0  0 |   |  7.8  |\n\nx = | (-8 * 6.2 + 2 * -3.6) / 3 |\n    | (-4 * 6.2 - 3 * -3.6 + 6 * 7.8) / 3 |\n    | 0 |\n\nx ≈ | 1.07 |\n    | 2.93 |\n    | 0    |\n\nSo, the approximate solution of the system is x ≈ 1.07, y ≈ 2.93, and z ≈ 0, rounded to two decimal places."
