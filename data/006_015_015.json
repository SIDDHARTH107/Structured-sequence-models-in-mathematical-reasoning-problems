    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, k computers being infected)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of computers, which is 30)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of computers being infected)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a single computer being infected, which is 0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a single computer not being infected, which is 0.95)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least one computer being infected, so we can find the probability of no computers being infected and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = C(30, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (0.95)^30\n\nC(30, 0) is 1 (since there's only one way to choose zero items from a set of 30), and any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, we have:\n\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^30 ≈ 0.2146\n\nNow, we find the probability of at least one computer being infected:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.2146 ≈ 0.7854\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network with 30 computers is approximately 0.7854 or 78.54%."
