    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal that is created through an iterative process. In each iteration, the number of cubes increases according to a specific pattern. \n\nIn the first iteration (n=1), the Menger sponge consists of 20 cubes. In each subsequent iteration, the number of cubes is multiplied by 20, since each existing cube is replaced by a smaller Menger sponge with 20 cubes.\n\nSo, for the 4th iteration (n=4), the total number of cubes can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^n\nTotal cubes = 20^4\nTotal cubes = 160,000\n\nThere are 160,000 cubes in the 4th iteration of the Menger sponge."
