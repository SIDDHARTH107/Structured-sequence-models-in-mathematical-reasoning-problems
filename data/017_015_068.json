    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information and the possible groups of order 24.\n\n1. C24: The cyclic group of order 24 is abelian, and the product of any two distinct non-identity elements can be the identity element. For example, let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3, then ab has order 6, and (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = e, where e is the identity element. So, G cannot be isomorphic to C24.\n\n2. A5: The alternating group A5 has order 60, not 24. So, G cannot be isomorphic to A5.\n\nNow, let's consider the five non-abelian groups of order 24:\n\n3. S3 × Z4: This group is a direct product of the symmetric group S3 and the cyclic group Z4. In this group, there are elements of order 2 and 4, and their product can be the identity element. For example, let a = (1, 2) ∈ S3 and b = (0, 2) ∈ Z4, then ab = (1, 0), and (ab)^2 = (1, 0)^2 = (1, 2)^2 = e. So, G cannot be isomorphic to S3 × Z4.\n\n4. Z2 × S3: This group is a direct product of the cyclic group Z2 and the symmetric group S3. Similar to the previous case, there are elements of order 2 and 3, and their product can be the identity element. So, G cannot be isomorphic to Z2 × S3.\n\n5. Z3 ⋊ Z8: This group is a semidirect product of the cyclic groups Z3 and Z8. In this group, there are elements of order 3 and 8, and their product can be the identity element. For example, let a = (1, 0) ∈ Z3 and b = (0, 2) ∈ Z8, then ab = (1, 2), and (ab)^6 = (1, 0)^6 = (1, 2)^6 = e. So, G cannot be isomorphic to Z3 ⋊ Z8.\n\n6. Z4 ⋊ Z6: This group is a semidirect product of the cyclic groups Z4 and Z6. In this group, there are elements of order 4 and 6, and their product can be the identity element. For example, let a = (1, 0) ∈ Z4 and b = (0, 2) ∈ Z6, then ab = (1, 2), and (ab)^4 = (1, 0)^4 = (1, 2)^4 = e. So, G cannot be isomorphic to Z4 ⋊ Z6.\n\n7. SL(2, 3): This group is the special linear group of 2x2 matrices with entries in the finite field of order 3. It is a non-abelian group of order 24. In this group, the product of any two distinct non-identity elements is also non-identity. Therefore, G is isomorphic to SL(2, 3).\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 24, where the product of any two distinct non-identity elements is also non-identity, is isomorphic to the special linear group SL(2, 3)."
