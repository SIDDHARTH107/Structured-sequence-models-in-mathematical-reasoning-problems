    "message_1": "A company has hired a software developer (agent) to develop a new piece of software. The company (principal) wants the software developer to work efficiently and complete the task quickly. However, the software developer may have an incentive to work slowly and charge the company more hours. The developer's hourly wage is $50, and the company values the software at $10,000. Based on the company's estimation, it should take the software developer 200 hours to complete the task. The company wants to offer a bonus to the software developer if the task is completed in fewer than 200 hours. What is the maximum bonus the company should offer to the software developer to make it in their interest to complete the task as quickly as possible?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of hours the software developer actually takes to complete the task as x. The company's total cost for the software development will be the developer's hourly wage multiplied by the number of hours worked, plus the bonus.\n\nTotal cost = (hourly wage * x) + bonus\n\nThe company wants to make sure that the total cost of the software development does not exceed the value of the software, which is $10,000.\n\n10,000 >= (50 * x) + bonus\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum bonus that the company can offer to the software developer to incentivize them to complete the task in fewer than 200 hours.\n\nIf the developer completes the task in exactly 200 hours, the company's total cost without the bonus would be:\n\nTotal cost without bonus = 50 * 200 = $10,000\n\nTo incentivize the developer to complete the task in fewer than 200 hours, the company should offer a bonus that makes the total cost less than $10,000 when the developer finishes the task in less than 200 hours.\n\nLet's assume the developer completes the task in 199 hours. In this case, the total cost without the bonus would be:\n\nTotal cost without bonus = 50 * 199 = $9,950\n\nTo make it in the developer's interest to complete the task in 199 hours, the company should offer a bonus that makes the total cost equal to $10,000.\n\n10,000 = (50 * 199) + bonus\n10,000 = 9,950 + bonus\nbonus = $50\n\nThus, the maximum bonus the company should offer to the software developer to make it in their interest to complete the task as quickly as possible is $50."
