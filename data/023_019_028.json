    "message_2": "To determine the stability of a system using its transfer function H(s), we need to analyze the poles of the function. The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero. A system is stable if all the poles have negative real parts, and unstable if any pole has a positive real part.\n\nGiven the transfer function H(s) = (s+2)/(s^2+4s+5), let's find the poles by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots (the poles) using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4*1*5)) / 2*1\ns = (-4 ± √(16 - 20)) / 2\ns = (-4 ± √(-4)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the roots of the equation are complex conjugates:\n\ns = -2 ± j\n\nBoth poles have a real part of -2, which is negative. Therefore, the system is stable."
