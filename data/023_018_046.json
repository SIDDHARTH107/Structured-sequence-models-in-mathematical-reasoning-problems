Evaluate the gain and phase margins of the closed-loop system.",
    "message_2": "To determine the closed-loop transfer function with unity negative feedback, we first need to find the open-loop transfer function, which is given by G(s). The closed-loop transfer function, T(s), can be found using the following formula:\n\nT(s) = G(s) / (1 + G(s))\n\nNow, substitute the given G(s) into the formula:\n\nT(s) = (2s + 1) / (s^2 + 3s + 2) / (1 + (2s + 1) / (s^2 + 3s + 2))\n\nTo simplify the expression, multiply the numerator and denominator by (s^2 + 3s + 2):\n\nT(s) = (2s + 1) / ((s^2 + 3s + 2) + (2s + 1))\n\nT(s) = (2s + 1) / (s^2 + 5s + 3)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the gain and phase margins of the closed-loop system. To do this, we will replace s with jω (j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency) to convert the transfer function into the frequency domain:\n\nT(jω) = (2jω + 1) / (ω^2 + 5jω + 3)\n\nNext, we will find the magnitude and phase of T(jω):\n\n|T(jω)| = |(2jω + 1) / (ω^2 + 5jω + 3)|\n\n∠T(jω) = ∠(2jω + 1) - ∠(ω^2 + 5jω + 3)\n\nThe gain margin is the amount of gain increase or decrease required to make the system unstable. To find the gain margin, we need to find the frequency at which the phase shift is -180° (or 180°) and then calculate the difference in gain from 0 dB at that frequency.\n\nThe phase margin is the difference between the phase angle of the system and -180° (or 180°) at the frequency where the gain is 0 dB (or 1 in magnitude). To find the phase margin, we need to find the frequency at which the magnitude is 1 and then calculate the difference in phase from -180° (or 180°) at that frequency.\n\nTo find the gain and phase margins, we need to solve the equations for |T(jω)| and ∠T(jω) at the respective frequencies. However, these equations are complex and require numerical methods to solve. You can use tools like MATLAB or Python to find the gain and phase margins of the closed-loop system."
