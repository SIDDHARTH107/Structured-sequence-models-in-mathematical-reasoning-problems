    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier transform of the given function f(t) = 3t + 4sin(2t) over the interval -π to π, we will use the following formula for the continuous Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the interval -π to π.\n\nFor f(t) = 3t + 4sin(2t), we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[-π to π] [(3t + 4sin(2t)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we'll break the integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[-π to π] (3t * e^(-jωt)) dt + ∫[-π to π] (4sin(2t) * e^(-jωt)) dt\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n\n∫[-π to π] (3t * e^(-jωt)) dt\n\nIntegration by parts:\nu = 3t, dv = e^(-jωt) dt\ndu = 3 dt, v = (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\n(3t * (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)) | -π to π - ∫[-π to π] ((-1/jω) * e^(-jωt) * 3) dt\n\nNow, evaluate the limits:\n\n[(-3π/jω) * e^(-jωπ) - (-3π/jω) * e^(jωπ)] - (-3/jω) * ∫[-π to π] (e^(-jωt)) dt\n\nThe integral of e^(-jωt) over -π to π is zero, so the expression becomes:\n\n(-3π/jω) * (e^(-jωπ) - e^(jωπ))\n\nNow, let's solve the second integral:\n\n∫[-π to π] (4sin(2t) * e^(-jωt)) dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula for sine: sin(x) = (e^(jx) - e^(-jx)) / (2j)\n\n∫[-π to π] (4 * (e^(j2t) - e^(-j2t)) / (2j) * e^(-jωt)) dt\n\nSimplify:\n\n∫[-π to π] (2 * (e^(j(2t - ωt)) - e^(-j(2t + ωt)))) dt\n\nNow, break the integral into two parts:\n\n2 * [∫[-π to π] (e^(j(2t - ωt))) dt - ∫[-π to π] (e^(-j(2t + ωt))) dt]\n\nBoth integrals are similar, and their solutions are:\n\n(2/j(2 - ω)) * (e^(j(2t - ωt)) | -π to π) - (2/j(-2 - ω)) * (e^(-j(2t + ωt)) | -π to π)\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\n(2/j(2 - ω)) * (e^(j(2π - ωπ)) - e^(-j(2π - ωπ))) - (2/j(-2 - ω)) * (e^(-j(2π + ωπ)) - e^(j(2π + ωπ)))\n\nNow, combine the results of both integrals:\n\nF(ω) = (-3π/jω) * (e^(-jωπ) - e^(jωπ)) + (2/j(2 - ω)) * (e^(j(2π - ωπ)) - e^(-j(2π - ωπ))) - (2/j(-2 - ω)) * (e^(-j(2π + ωπ)) - e^(j(2π + ωπ)))\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = 3t + 4sin(2t) over the interval -π to π.\n\nIn the context of finance and economics, the Fourier transform can be used to analyze time series data, such as stock prices or economic indicators, by decomposing the data into its frequency components. This can help identify underlying trends, cycles, or patterns in the data that may not be apparent from the raw time series."
