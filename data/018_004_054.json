    "message_2": "To find the complement of a set A, we first need to define a universal set U that contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nLet's assume that the universal set U is the set of integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now, we can find the complement of A with respect to U.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's prove that the complement of A is unique. Suppose there are two complements of A, A' and B', such that A' ≠ B'. This means that there exists an element x that is in A' but not in B', or in B' but not in A'. Without loss of generality, let's assume x ∈ A' and x ∉ B'.\n\nSince x ∈ A', x ∉ A (by definition of complement). Also, since x ∉ B', x must be in B (by definition of complement). But this contradicts the fact that A and B are complements, as x is now in both A and B. Therefore, our assumption that A' ≠ B' must be false, and the complement of A is unique."
