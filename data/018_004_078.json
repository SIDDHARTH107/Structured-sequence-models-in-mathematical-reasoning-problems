    "message_1": "Let A = {3, 5, 7, 9, 11} be a set, and let B and C be sets such that B complement = A complement and C complement = A complement. Find the intersection between B and C.",
    "message_2": "Since B complement = A complement and C complement = A complement, it means that both B and C have the same elements not in A. To find the intersection between B and C, we need to find the elements that are common to both B and C.\n\nSince both B and C have the same complement (A complement), their intersection will be the same as their complement. Therefore, the intersection between B and C is A complement.\n\nTo find A complement, we need to know the universal set U. However, the universal set is not provided in the problem. If we assume the universal set U contains all integers, then A complement would be the set of all integers except {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}. In this case, the intersection between B and C would be the set of all integers except {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}."
