The student has 5 items to choose from, each with its own weight and value:\n\nItem 1: 3 pounds, $10 value\nItem 2: 5 pounds, $8 value\nItem 3: 7 pounds, $5 value\nItem 4: 9 pounds, $3 value\nItem 5: 12 pounds, $2 value\n\nWhat is the optimal combination of items the student should pack in the backpack to maximize the total value while staying within the weight limit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal combination of items, we can calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item and then try different combinations within the weight limit.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\nItem 1: $10 / 3 lbs = $3.33/lb\nItem 2: $8 / 5 lbs = $1.60/lb\nItem 3: $5 / 7 lbs = $0.71/lb\nItem 4: $3 / 9 lbs = $0.33/lb\nItem 5: $2 / 12 lbs = $0.17/lb\n\nWe should prioritize items with higher value-to-weight ratios. Let's start with Item 1 and try different combinations:\n\n1. Item 1 (3 lbs) + Item 2 (5 lbs) = 8 lbs, $18 value\n2. Item 1 (3 lbs) + Item 3 (7 lbs) = 10 lbs, $15 value\n3. Item 1 (3 lbs) + Item 4 (9 lbs) = 12 lbs, $13 value\n4. Item 1 (3 lbs) + Item 5 (12 lbs) = 15 lbs, $12 value\n5. Item 1 (3 lbs) + Item 2 (5 lbs) + Item 3 (7 lbs) = 15 lbs, $23 value\n\nThe optimal combination is Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3, which has a total weight of 15 pounds and a total value of $23."
