    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Determine the possible group structures using the prime factors: \n   For 2^3, we have the following possibilities: C_8, C_4 x C_2, and C_2 x C_2 x C_2\n   For 3^2, we have the following possibilities: C_9 and C_3 x C_3\n3. Combine the possibilities using the direct product: \n   a. C_8 x C_9\n   b. C_8 x (C_3 x C_3)\n   c. (C_4 x C_2) x C_9\n   d. (C_4 x C_2) x (C_3 x C_3)\n   e. (C_2 x C_2 x C_2) x C_9\n   f. (C_2 x C_2 x C_2) x (C_3 x C_3)\n4. Determine the number of non-isomorphic groups for each combination:\n   a. C_8 x C_9: 1 group (C_72)\n   b. C_8 x (C_3 x C_3): 1 group (C_8 x C_9)\n   c. (C_4 x C_2) x C_9: 2 groups (C_4 x C_18 and C_36 x C_2)\n   d. (C_4 x C_2) x (C_3 x C_3): 1 group (C_4 x C_6 x C_3)\n   e. (C_2 x C_2 x C_2) x C_9: 1 group (C_2 x C_2 x C_18)\n   f. (C_2 x C_2 x C_2) x (C_3 x C_3): 1 group (C_2 x C_2 x C_6 x C_3)\n\nAdding up the number of non-isomorphic groups for each combination, we get:\n\n1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
