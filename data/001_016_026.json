    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $2^5 \\cdot 2^3$, we use the rule for multiplying exponential expressions with the same base: $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$. In this case, the base is 2, and the exponents are 5 and 3. \n\nSo, we have:\n\n$2^5 \\cdot 2^3 = 2^{5+3} = 2^8$\n\nTherefore, the simplified exponential expression is $2^8$."
