    "message_1": "Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ defined over a field $K$. Suppose there exists a birational morphism $f:X\\rightarrow Y$ where $Y$ is a smooth projective curve such that the degree of the canonical divisor $K_Y$ is $d$.\n\nFind the degree of the canonical divisor $K_X$ in terms of $g$ and $d$.",
    "message_2": "Since $f:X\\rightarrow Y$ is a birational morphism, there exists an integer $r$ such that the ramification divisor $R$ of $f$ satisfies $f^*(K_Y) = K_X + R$ and $deg(R) = r$. We want to find the degree of the canonical divisor $K_X$ in terms of $g$ and $d$.\n\nRecall the Riemann-Hurwitz formula for a morphism of curves:\n$$2g_X - 2 = deg(f)(2g_Y - 2) + r$$\n\nWe know that $deg(f^*(K_Y)) = deg(K_X) + r$ and $deg(K_Y) = d$. Since $f^*$ is linear, we have $deg(f^*(K_Y)) = deg(f) \\cdot d$. Therefore, $deg(K_X) + r = deg(f) \\cdot d$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Riemann-Hurwitz formula as:\n$$2g - 2 = deg(f)(2g_Y - 2) + (deg(f) \\cdot d - deg(K_X))$$\n\nWe want to find $deg(K_X)$, so let's solve for it:\n$$deg(K_X) = deg(f) \\cdot d - (2g - 2 - deg(f)(2g_Y - 2))$$\n\nSince $g_Y$ is not given, we cannot simplify this expression further. However, we have expressed the degree of the canonical divisor $K_X$ in terms of $g$, $d$, and the degree of the morphism $f$."
