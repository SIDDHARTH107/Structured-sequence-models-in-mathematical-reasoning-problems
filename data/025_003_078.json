    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the projective variety V, we first compute the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x, y, and z. Let F(x, y, z) = x^2z - y^2z - 4x^2. Then, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2xz - 8x\n∂F/∂y = -2yz\n∂F/∂z = x^2 - y^2\n\nA point (x, y, z) is singular if all the partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, i.e., ∂F/∂x = ∂F/∂y = ∂F/∂z = 0. Let's analyze these equations:\n\n1) 2xz - 8x = 0\n2) -2yz = 0\n3) x^2 - y^2 = 0\n\nFrom equation (2), we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: y = 0\nIn this case, equation (3) becomes x^2 = 0, which implies x = 0. However, in projective space, the point (0, 0, z) is not well-defined, so there are no singular points in this case.\n\nCase 2: z = 0\nIn this case, equation (1) becomes 2x(0) - 8x = 0, which simplifies to -8x = 0, so x = 0. Now, equation (3) becomes 0 - y^2 = 0, which implies y^2 = 0, so y = 0. However, as mentioned before, the point (0, 0, z) is not well-defined in projective space, so there are no singular points in this case either.\n\nThus, there are no singular points for the projective variety V defined by the equation x^2z - y^2z - 4x^2 = 0 in P^2. Since there are no singular points, there are no multiplicities to compute."
