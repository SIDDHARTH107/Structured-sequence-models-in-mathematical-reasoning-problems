    "message_1": "A right circular cylinder has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 10 cm. Calculate the volume of the solid obtained when this cylinder is sliced from top to bottom by a plane perpendicular to its base, and the resulting shape is a frustum with a height of 6 cm.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the frustum, we first need to find the volume of the larger cylinder and the smaller cylinder that was removed when the frustum was created.\n\n1. The volume of the larger cylinder (V1):\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\nIn this case, the radius is 4 cm and the height is 10 cm.\nV1 = π(4^2)(10) = π(16)(10) = 160π cubic centimeters.\n\n2. The volume of the smaller cylinder (V2):\nSince the frustum has a height of 6 cm, the height of the smaller cylinder is the difference between the height of the larger cylinder and the height of the frustum, which is 10 - 6 = 4 cm.\nWe need to find the radius of the smaller cylinder. Since the frustum and the cylinders are similar, we can set up a proportion using the heights and radii:\n(height of frustum) / (height of smaller cylinder) = (radius of frustum) / (radius of smaller cylinder)\n6 / 4 = 4 / r\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n6r = 16\nr = 16 / 6 = 8 / 3 cm\n\nNow we can find the volume of the smaller cylinder:\nV2 = π(8/3)^2(4) = π(64/9)(4) = 256π/9 cubic centimeters.\n\n3. The volume of the frustum (Vf):\nTo find the volume of the frustum, we subtract the volume of the smaller cylinder from the volume of the larger cylinder:\nVf = V1 - V2 = 160π - 256π/9\n\nTo subtract these, we need a common denominator, which is 9:\nVf = (1440π - 256π) / 9 = 1184π / 9 cubic centimeters.\n\nSo, the volume of the frustum is 1184π/9 cubic centimeters."
