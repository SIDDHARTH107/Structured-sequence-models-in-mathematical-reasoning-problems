    "message_1": "Consider the following system of two linear equations: \n\n2x + y = 5 \n\n4.01x + 2.01y = 10.02 \n\nFind the solution for this system of equations using Gaussian elimination. Check whether the matrix of the coefficients is ill-conditioned or not. If it is ill-conditioned, explain why.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n|  2   1  |  5  |\n|  4.01  2.01  |  10.02  |\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to find the solution.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n|  1  0.5  |  2.5  |\n|  4.01  2.01  |  10.02  |\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4.01 times the first row from the second row to eliminate the leading 4.01 in the second row:\n\nSecond row - 4.01 * First row:\n\n|  1  0.5  |  2.5  |\n|  0  0.005  |  0.02  |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 0.005 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n|  1  0.5  |  2.5  |\n|  0  1  |  4  |\n\nStep 4: Subtract 0.5 times the second row from the first row to eliminate the 0.5 in the first row:\n\nFirst row - 0.5 * Second row:\n\n|  1  0  |  0.5  |\n|  0  1  |  4  |\n\nNow we have the matrix in reduced row echelon form, and we can read off the solution: x = 0.5 and y = 4.\n\nNow let's check if the matrix of coefficients is ill-conditioned. A matrix is considered ill-conditioned if its condition number is large. The condition number is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. In this case, we'll use the infinity norm, which is the maximum absolute row sum of a matrix.\n\nThe matrix of coefficients is:\n\n|  2  1  |\n|  4.01  2.01  |\n\nThe infinity norm of this matrix is max(2 + 1, 4.01 + 2.01) = max(3, 6.02) = 6.02.\n\nNow we need to find the inverse of the matrix:\n\n|  a  b  |\n|  c  d  |\n\nThe inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\n(1 / determinant) * |  d  -b  |\n                                |  -c  a  |\n\nThe determinant of the matrix is (2 * 2.01) - (1 * 4.01) = 4.02 - 4.01 = 0.01.\n\nThe inverse of the matrix is:\n\n(1 / 0.01) * |  2.01  -1  |\n                      |  -4.01  2  |\n\n|  201  -100  |\n|  -401  200  |\n\nThe infinity norm of the inverse matrix is max(201 + 100, 401 + 200) = max(301, 601) = 601.\n\nNow we can calculate the condition number:\n\nCondition number = (infinity norm of matrix) * (infinity norm of inverse matrix) = 6.02 * 601 â‰ˆ 3618.02.\n\nSince the condition number is large, the matrix of coefficients is ill-conditioned. This means that the system of equations is sensitive to small changes in the coefficients, and small errors in the coefficients can lead to large errors in the solution. In this case, the coefficients are very close to being multiples of each other, which makes the matrix nearly singular and contributes to the ill-conditioning."
