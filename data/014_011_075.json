    "message_2": "To find the number of unique ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" using a transposition cipher, we need to find the number of permutations of the letters in the word.\n\nThe word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" has 12 letters, with the following frequency of each letter:\nC - 1\nR - 2\nY - 1\nP - 1\nT - 1\nO - 1\nG - 1\nA - 1\nH - 1\n\nTo find the number of unique permutations, we can use the formula for permutations of a set with duplicate items:\n\nn! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of each unique item.\n\nIn this case, n = 12, n1 = 2 (for R), and all other frequencies are 1.\n\nSo, the number of unique permutations is:\n\n12! / (2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!)\n\n12! / (2!) = 479001600 / 2 = 239500800\n\nThere are 239,500,800 unique ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" using a transposition cipher."
