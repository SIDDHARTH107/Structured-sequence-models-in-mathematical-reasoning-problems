    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2/x) + (5/(x+2)) = 1, we will first find a common denominator and then solve for x.\n\nStep 1: Find a common denominator\nThe common denominator for x and (x+2) is x(x+2).\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the equation with the common denominator\n(2/x) * (x+2)/(x+2) + (5/(x+2)) * x/x = 1\n(2(x+2) + 5x) / (x(x+2)) = 1\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation\n(2x + 4 + 5x) / (x^2 + 2x) = 1\n(7x + 4) / (x^2 + 2x) = 1\n\nStep 4: Cross-multiply\n7x + 4 = x^2 + 2x\n\nStep 5: Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation\nx^2 + 2x - 7x - 4 = 0\nx^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\n\nStep 6: Factor the quadratic equation\n(x - 4)(x - 1) = 0\n\nStep 7: Solve for x\nx - 4 = 0 or x - 1 = 0\nx = 4 or x = 1\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 1 and 4."
