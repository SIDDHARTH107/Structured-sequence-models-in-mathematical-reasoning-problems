    "message_2": "To prove or disprove that H is a normal subgroup of G, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a subgroup divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem).\n2. A subgroup of index 2 is always normal.\n3. If a group has a unique subgroup of a certain order, that subgroup is normal.\n\nSince |G| = 27 and |H| = 3, we know that the index of H in G is [G:H] = |G|/|H| = 27/3 = 9. This means that there are 9 distinct cosets of H in G. Since the index is not 2, we cannot directly conclude that H is normal using fact 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow theorems. Since 27 = 3^3, G has a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3^3 = 27. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for n_3 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 27 in G. This Sylow 3-subgroup is normal in G, as it is unique.\n\nHowever, H is a subgroup of order 3, not 27. To determine if H is normal, we need to find the number of subgroups of order 3 in G. Since G has a unique subgroup of order 27, and 27 = 3^3, G must be a group of exponent 3. This means that every element in G has an order that divides 3.\n\nNow, let's count the number of elements of order 3 in G. There are 27 - 1 = 26 non-identity elements in G. Since every element has an order that divides 3, the non-identity elements must have order 3. Each subgroup of order 3 contains two non-identity elements of order 3, and these two elements uniquely determine the subgroup. Therefore, there are 26/2 = 13 subgroups of order 3 in G.\n\nSince there are multiple subgroups of order 3 in G, H is not unique, and we cannot conclude that H is normal using fact 3.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot prove that H is a normal subgroup of G just based on the given information. It is possible for H to be normal in some cases, but it is not guaranteed."
