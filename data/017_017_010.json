Show that HK is a subgroup of G and has order 15 or 30, and hence G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30.",
    "message_2": "First, we note that the orders of H and K are both prime (5 and 3, respectively). By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since the orders of H and K are prime and divide the order of G, H and K are both cyclic and are generated by elements of order 5 and 3, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the set HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. We want to show that HK is a subgroup of G. To do this, we will use the following criterion: if for any two elements x, y ∈ HK, their product xy^(-1) is also in HK, then HK is a subgroup of G.\n\nLet x = h1k1 and y = h2k2 be two elements in HK, where h1, h2 ∈ H and k1, k2 ∈ K. Then, we have:\n\nxy^(-1) = h1k1(h2k2)^(-1) = h1k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) (since G is a group, inverses exist)\n\nNow, since H and K are subgroups, h2^(-1) ∈ H and k2^(-1) ∈ K. We want to show that there exist h3 ∈ H and k3 ∈ K such that h1k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) = h3k3.\n\nNotice that H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element. This is because the orders of H and K are prime and do not share any common divisors other than 1. Therefore, H and K are disjoint except for the identity element.\n\nNow, consider the element k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) ∈ G. Since the orders of H and K are 5 and 3, respectively, the order of this element must be a divisor of the least common multiple of 5 and 3, which is 15. Thus, the order of k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) is either 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n\nIf the order of k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) is 1, then k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) = e, and we have h1k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) = h1e = h1 ∈ H, so HK is a subgroup of G in this case.\n\nIf the order of k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) is 3, then k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) ∈ K, and we have h1k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) = h1(k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1)) ∈ HK, so HK is a subgroup of G in this case.\n\nIf the order of k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) is 5, then k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) ∈ H, and we have h1k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) = (h1k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1)) ∈ HK, so HK is a subgroup of G in this case.\n\nIf the order of k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) is 15, then k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) ∈ HK, and we have h1k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1) = h1(k1k2^(-1)h2^(-1)) ∈ HK, so HK is a subgroup of G in this case.\n\nIn all cases, we have shown that HK is a subgroup of G. Now, we want to determine the order of HK. By the double coset formula, we have:\n\n|HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 5 * 3 / 1 = 15\n\nSince HK is a subgroup of G and has order 15, G must have a normal subgroup of order 15 (by the correspondence theorem). Thus, G is either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, as desired."
