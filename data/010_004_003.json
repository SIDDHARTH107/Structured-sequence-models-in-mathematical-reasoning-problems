    "message_2": "To prove that any closed ball in X is a compact set, we need to show that every open cover of the closed ball has a finite subcover. Let B(x0, r) be a closed ball in X, where x0 is the center, r is the radius, and d is the metric.\n\nLet {U_i} be an open cover of B(x0, r). We need to show that there exists a finite subcover {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n} such that B(x0, r) ⊆ U_1 ∪ U_2 ∪ ... ∪ U_n.\n\nSince x0 is in B(x0, r), there exists an open set U_0 ∈ {U_i} such that x0 ∈ U_0. Let ε > 0 be such that B(x0, ε) ⊆ U_0. Now, consider any point x ∈ B(x0, r). We have d(x, x0) ≤ r. We will show that there exists a finite subcover for x.\n\nLet δ = min{ε, r - d(x, x0)}. Then, B(x, δ) is contained in B(x0, r), because for any point y ∈ B(x, δ), we have d(y, x0) ≤ d(y, x) + d(x, x0) < δ + d(x, x0) ≤ r.\n\nSince {U_i} is an open cover of B(x0, r), there exists an open set U_x ∈ {U_i} such that x ∈ U_x. Let ε_x > 0 be such that B(x, ε_x) ⊆ U_x. Let δ_x = min{δ, ε_x}. Then, B(x, δ_x) ⊆ U_x.\n\nNow, consider the collection of open balls {B(x, δ_x/2) : x ∈ B(x0, r)}. This collection is an open cover of B(x0, r). By the Lebesgue number lemma, there exists a positive number λ > 0 such that every subset of B(x0, r) with diameter less than λ is contained in some B(x, δ_x/2).\n\nChoose a finite set of points {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n} ⊆ B(x0, r) such that B(x0, r) ⊆ B(x_1, λ/2) ∪ B(x_2, λ/2) ∪ ... ∪ B(x_n, λ/2). Then, for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, there exists an open set U_i ∈ {U_i} such that B(x_i, δ_i/2) ⊆ U_i. Therefore, B(x0, r) ⊆ U_1 ∪ U_2 ∪ ... ∪ U_n, which is a finite subcover of {U_i}.\n\nNow, let's consider the numerical example. Let X = R^n with the Euclidean metric d(x, y) = sqrt((x_1 - y_1)^2 + ... + (x_n - y_n)^2). We want to show that the closed ball B(0, 1) = {x ∈ R^n : d(x, 0) ≤ 1} is compact.\n\nBy the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of R^n is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The closed ball B(0, 1) is clearly bounded, as all its points are at a distance of at most 1 from the origin. To show that it is closed, let x be a limit point of B(0, 1). Then, there exists a sequence {x_k} in B(0, 1) such that x_k → x as k → ∞. Since d(x_k, 0) ≤ 1 for all k, by the triangle inequality, we have d(x, 0) ≤ d(x, x_k) + d(x_k, 0) ≤ d(x, x_k) + 1. As x_k → x, we have d(x, x_k) → 0, so d(x, 0) ≤ 1. Therefore, x ∈ B(0, 1), and B(0, 1) is closed.\n\nSince B(0, 1) is closed and bounded, it is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem."
