    "message_2": "To show that there exist exactly two non-isomorphic groups of order 4, we will first show that any group of order 4 must be either cyclic or a Klein four-group. Then, we will show that these two groups are not isomorphic to each other.\n\nLet G be a group of order 4. Since the order of any element in G must divide the order of G (by Lagrange's theorem), the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. There must be at least one element of order 1, which is the identity element e.\n\nIf G has an element of order 4, say a, then G is generated by a and is therefore a cyclic group of order 4, which is isomorphic to C4. So, let's assume that G has no element of order 4.\n\nNow, G must have at least one element of order 2, say b. Since G has 4 elements and we already have e and b, there are two more elements left. Let's call them c and d. Since G has no element of order 4, both c and d must have order 2 as well. Now, we have:\n\n1. e has order 1\n2. b has order 2\n3. c has order 2\n4. d has order 2\n\nSince G is a group, it must be closed under its operation. We know that b * b = e and c * c = e. Let's consider the product b * c. It cannot be equal to b or c since b and c have order 2. It also cannot be equal to e, because that would imply that b and c are inverses of each other, and then d would be missing from the group. Therefore, b * c = d.\n\nNow, we have the following relations in G:\n\n1. e * x = x * e = x for all x in G\n2. b * b = e\n3. c * c = e\n4. d * d = e\n5. b * c = d\n6. c * b = d (since b and c have order 2, they are their own inverses, and thus b * c = c * b)\n\nThese relations uniquely define the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn summary, any group of order 4 must be either isomorphic to C4 or V4. Now, we need to show that C4 and V4 are not isomorphic to each other. This can be done by observing that C4 has an element of order 4 (its generator), while all non-identity elements in V4 have order 2. Since isomorphic groups must have the same number of elements of each order, C4 and V4 are not isomorphic.\n\nNow, let's find all possible isomorphisms from G to either C4 or V4. If G is isomorphic to C4, there is only one isomorphism, which maps the generator of G to the generator of C4. This is because the cyclic structure of the group is uniquely determined by its generator.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to V4, we have more possibilities. Let φ: G → V4 be an isomorphism. We must have φ(e) = e. There are 3 non-identity elements in V4, and φ must map the 3 non-identity elements of G to these 3 elements. There are 3! = 6 ways to assign these elements, but since V4 is an abelian group, the order of the elements does not matter. Therefore, there are 3! / 3 = 2 possible isomorphisms from G to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, there exist exactly two non-isomorphic groups of order 4, namely the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4. There is one possible isomorphism from G to C4 and two possible isomorphisms from G to V4."
