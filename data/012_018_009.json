    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G, denoted by Î»(G), is the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. According to Menger's theorem, the edge connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimum degree of the graph, which is the smallest degree of all its vertices.\n\nIn this case, the graph G has 7 vertices, and the minimum degree of each vertex is 3. Therefore, the edge connectivity of the graph G is 3."
