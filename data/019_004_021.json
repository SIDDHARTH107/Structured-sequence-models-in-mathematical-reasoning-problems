Using temporal logic, calculate the probability that the system will successfully perform the task within a time frame of 10 minutes.",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the given information and calculate the probability of successfully performing the task within 10 minutes.\n\nThe system can perform the task in 5 minutes, so within a 10-minute time frame, it can attempt the task twice.\n\nLet P(S) be the probability of success in one attempt, and P(F) be the probability of failure in one attempt.\n\nP(S) = 0.95 (95% success rate)\nP(F) = 0.05 (5% failure rate)\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios within the 10-minute time frame:\n\n1. The system succeeds on the first attempt.\n2. The system fails on the first attempt but succeeds on the second attempt.\n\nWe can calculate the probability of each scenario and then sum them up to find the overall probability of success within 10 minutes.\n\nScenario 1: The probability of success on the first attempt is P(S).\n\nScenario 2: The probability of failure on the first attempt and success on the second attempt is P(F) * P(S).\n\nSo, the overall probability of success within 10 minutes is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n\nP(success within 10 minutes) = P(S) + P(F) * P(S)\nP(success within 10 minutes) = 0.95 + 0.05 * 0.95\nP(success within 10 minutes) = 0.95 + 0.0475\nP(success within 10 minutes) = 0.9975\n\nTherefore, the probability that the system will successfully perform the task within a time frame of 10 minutes is 99.75%."
