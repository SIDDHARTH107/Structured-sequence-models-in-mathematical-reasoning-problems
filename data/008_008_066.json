    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time. Each unit of Product B requires 4 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. If only 24 hours of labor time and 15 hours of machine time are available during the current period, how many units of each product should be produced in order to maximize profit, given the following profit per unit: $20 profit for each unit of Product A and $30 profit for each unit of Product B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time can be represented as follows:\n\nLabor constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 24\nMachine constraint: 3x + y ≤ 15\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. Solve the labor constraint for y:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 24\ny ≤ (24 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ 6 - 0.5x\n\n2. Solve the machine constraint for y:\n\n3x + y ≤ 15\ny ≤ 15 - 3x\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the intersection points of the constraint equations:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n\ny = 6 - 0.5x\n0 = 6 - 0.5x\nx = 12\n\nSo, the intersection point is (12, 0).\n\n2. Intersection of machine constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n\ny = 15 - 3x\n0 = 15 - 3x\nx = 5\n\nSo, the intersection point is (5, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n\ny = 6 - 0.5x\ny = 6 - 0.5(0)\ny = 6\n\nSo, the intersection point is (0, 6).\n\n4. Intersection of labor constraint and machine constraint:\n\n6 - 0.5x = 15 - 3x\n2.5x = 9\nx = 3.6\n\ny = 15 - 3x\ny = 15 - 3(3.6)\ny = 4.2\n\nSo, the intersection point is (3.6, 4.2).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (12, 0):\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y = 20(12) + 30(0) = $240\n\n2. Profit at (5, 0):\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y = 20(5) + 30(0) = $100\n\n3. Profit at (0, 6):\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y = 20(0) + 30(6) = $180\n\n4. Profit at (3.6, 4.2):\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y = 20(3.6) + 30(4.2) ≈ $246.00\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the point (3.6, 4.2) with a profit of approximately $246. However, since we cannot produce a fraction of a product, we need to round the values of x and y to the nearest integers. The closest integer values are (4, 4), which will result in a slightly lower profit:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y = 20(4) + 30(4) = $200\n\nSo, to maximize profit, the company should produce 4 units of Product A and 4 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $200."
