    "message_2": "Let $\\alpha$ be a 1-form on $M$ that is co-closed and orthogonal to $\\omega$. We want to find the dimension of the space of such 1-forms.\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions:\n\n1. A 1-form $\\alpha$ is co-closed if $d\\alpha^* = 0$, where $\\alpha^*$ is the Hodge dual of $\\alpha$.\n2. Two forms are orthogonal if their wedge product is zero, i.e., $\\alpha \\wedge \\omega = 0$.\n\nNow, let's use the Hodge decomposition theorem, which states that any $k$-form $\\beta$ on a compact Riemannian manifold can be decomposed uniquely as $\\beta = d\\gamma + \\delta\\eta + \\zeta$, where $\\gamma$ is a $(k-1)$-form, $\\eta$ is a $(k+1)$-form, and $\\zeta$ is a harmonic $k$-form (i.e., $d\\zeta = \\delta\\zeta = 0$).\n\nApplying the Hodge decomposition theorem to the 1-form $\\alpha$, we get $\\alpha = d\\gamma + \\delta\\eta + \\zeta$, where $\\gamma$ is a 0-form (i.e., a function), $\\eta$ is a 2-form, and $\\zeta$ is a harmonic 1-form.\n\nSince $\\alpha$ is co-closed, we have $d\\alpha^* = 0$. Taking the Hodge dual of the decomposition, we get $\\alpha^* = d\\gamma^* + \\delta\\eta^* + \\zeta^*$. Since $d\\alpha^* = 0$, we have $\\delta\\eta^* = -d\\gamma^* - \\zeta^*$.\n\nNow, let's consider the orthogonality condition $\\alpha \\wedge \\omega = 0$. Using the decomposition of $\\alpha$, we have $(d\\gamma + \\delta\\eta + \\zeta) \\wedge \\omega = 0$. Since $\\omega$ is a closed 2-form, we have $d\\omega = 0$. Therefore, the wedge product with $d\\gamma$ vanishes, and we get $(\\delta\\eta + \\zeta) \\wedge \\omega = 0$.\n\nSince $\\delta\\eta^* = -d\\gamma^* - \\zeta^*$, we have $\\eta^* \\wedge \\omega = -\\zeta^* \\wedge \\omega$. Thus, the orthogonality condition reduces to $\\zeta^* \\wedge \\omega = 0$. This implies that the harmonic 1-form $\\zeta$ is orthogonal to the closed 2-form $\\omega$.\n\nNow, we know that the space of harmonic 1-forms on a compact, connected 2-dimensional manifold without boundary is isomorphic to the first cohomology group $H^1(M)$. By the Poincar√©-Hopf theorem, we have $b_1(M) = \\dim H^1(M)$, where $b_1(M)$ is the first Betti number of $M$. Since $M$ is a smooth, compact, connected 2-dimensional manifold without boundary, we have $b_1(M) = 2g(M)$, where $g(M)$ is the genus of $M$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the space of 1-forms on $M$ that are co-closed and orthogonal to $\\omega$ is equal to the dimension of the space of harmonic 1-forms on $M$ that are orthogonal to $\\omega$, which is equal to $2g(M)$."
