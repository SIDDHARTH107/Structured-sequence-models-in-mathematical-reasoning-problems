    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, player A is given $10 and proposes a division of the money with player B. If player B accepts the proposal, they both receive the proposed amounts. If player B rejects the proposal, both players receive $0. What is the most rational proposal for player A, and how can player B maximize their expected earnings?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the most rational proposal for player A depends on their understanding of player B's preferences and rationality. However, a common approach is for player A to propose a split that is slightly in their favor, such as $6 for player A and $4 for player B. This is because player B is likely to accept this proposal, as they would still receive a positive amount of money, and rejecting the proposal would result in both players receiving $0.\n\nTo maximize their expected earnings, player B should be willing to accept any proposal that gives them a positive amount of money, even if it is less than half of the total amount. This is because rejecting a proposal that gives them a positive amount would result in a guaranteed $0, which is worse than accepting a smaller amount. By being willing to accept any positive amount, player B increases the likelihood that player A will propose a division that is more favorable to player B, as player A would want to ensure that their proposal is accepted."
