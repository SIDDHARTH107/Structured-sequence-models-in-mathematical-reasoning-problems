    "message_2": "A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. In the context of geometry, a manifold typically refers to a surface or a higher-dimensional analogue. However, a triangle is a 2-dimensional object in the Euclidean plane, not a surface or higher-dimensional object.\n\nThe triangle with vertices at (-1, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 2) is a simple, non-degenerate triangle in the Euclidean plane. It does not have the properties of a manifold, as it is not a surface or higher-dimensional object. Instead, it is a 2-dimensional geometric shape in the plane."
