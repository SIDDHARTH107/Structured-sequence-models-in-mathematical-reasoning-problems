    "message_2": "A group of order 9 has either a prime order (p^2) or is a product of two prime orders (p * q). Since 9 = 3^2, there are two possible cases to consider: a group of order 3^2 or a group of order 3 * 3. \n\nCase 1: A group of order 3^2\nBy the Sylow theorems, there must be a normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal. Therefore, the group is a semi-direct product of the normal Sylow 3-subgroup and the other Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, there is only one possible semi-direct product, which is the direct product. This gives us the group C_9 (cyclic group of order 9).\n\nCase 2: A group of order 3 * 3\nIn this case, the group is a product of two cyclic groups of order 3. The only possible group is C_3 × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3).\n\nThus, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 9: C_9 and C_3 × C_3."
