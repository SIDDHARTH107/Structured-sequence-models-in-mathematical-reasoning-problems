    "message_1": "A tomato is considered \"ripe\" if its firmness rating is between 30-50 Newtons. If a tomato has a firmness reading of 40 Newtons, and the fuzzy set \"ripe\" has a membership function of:\n\n- μ(ripe)(x) = 0.6 for 30 ≤ x ≤ 40\n- μ(ripe)(x) = 0.4 for 40 < x ≤ 50\n- μ(ripe)(x) = 0 for x < 30 or x > 50\n\n What is the degree of membership of the tomato to the fuzzy set \"ripe\"?",
    "message_2": "Since the tomato has a firmness reading of 40 Newtons, we can use the first membership function:\n\nμ(ripe)(x) = 0.6 for 30 ≤ x ≤ 40\n\nSo, the degree of membership of the tomato to the fuzzy set \"ripe\" is 0.6."
