    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The given system can be represented as:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\\\n5 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nWe will use Doolittle's method for LU decomposition. We have:\n\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\nl_{21} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nU = \\begin{bmatrix}\nu_{11} & u_{12} \\\\\n0 & u_{22}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we can find L and U as follows:\n\n1. u_{11} = a_{11} = 2\n2. u_{12} = a_{12} = 3\n3. l_{21} = a_{21} / u_{11} = 5 / 2\n4. u_{22} = a_{22} - l_{21} * u_{12} = 4 - (5/2) * 3\n\nSo, we have:\n\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n2.5 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nU = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -0.5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will solve the system LY = B, where B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n8 \\\\\n17\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n1. y_1 = b_1 / l_{11} = 8 / 1 = 8\n2. y_2 = (b_2 - l_{21} * y_1) / l_{22} = (17 - 2.5 * 8) / 1 = -1\n\nSo, Y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n8 \\\\\n-1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nFinally, we will solve the system UX = Y:\n\n1. x_2 = y_2 / u_{22} = -1 / (-0.5) = 2\n2. x_1 = (y_1 - u_{12} * x_2) / u_{11} = (8 - 3 * 2) / 2 = 1\n\nSo, X = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x_1 = 1 and x_2 = 2."
