    "message_1": "In a basketball game, the probability of a player making a free throw is 0.75. If the player takes 4 free throws in a row, what is the probability that they make all of them?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the player making all 4 free throws in a row, we need to multiply the probability of making each individual free throw together since they are independent events. \n\nThe probability of making each free throw is 0.75. So, the probability of making all 4 free throws in a row is:\n\n0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.31640625\n\nTherefore, the probability of the player making all 4 free throws in a row is approximately 0.3164 or 31.64%."
