    "message_1": "Consider the following heat diffusion equation: \n\n∂u/∂t = k(∂²u/∂x²)\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, k is the thermal diffusivity, and the initial condition is u(x,0) = sin(πx/L) and the boundary conditions are u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0 for all time t. \n\nCalculate the temperature distribution u(x,t) at time t = 0.1 for a rod of length L = 1 meter with thermal diffusivity k = 0.05 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat diffusion equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the heat equation:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by kX(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t)/kT(t) = X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT'(t)/kT(t) = -λ²\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow, we solve the two ordinary differential equations separately:\n\n1. X''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\n2. T'(t) + kλ²T(t) = 0\n\nFor equation 1, the general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0:\n\nX(0) = A = 0\nX(L) = B*sin(λL) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(λL) = 0. This implies that λL = nπ for some integer n. Thus, λ = nπ/L, and the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = B*sin(nπx/L)\n\nFor equation 2, the general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-kλ²t)\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(πx/L):\n\nu(x,0) = X(x)T(0) = B*sin(nπx/L)*C\n\nComparing this with sin(πx/L), we see that n = 1, B*C = 1. Thus, the solution for the temperature distribution u(x,t) is:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(πx/L)*exp(-k(π/L)²t)\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature distribution at time t = 0.1 for a rod of length L = 1 meter with thermal diffusivity k = 0.05 m²/s:\n\nu(x,0.1) = sin(πx)*exp(-0.05*(π)²*0.1)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution u(x,t) at time t = 0.1 for the given rod."
