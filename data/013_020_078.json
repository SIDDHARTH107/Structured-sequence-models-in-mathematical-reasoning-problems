    "message_1": "In a beauty contest game, there are 10 players who are asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 times the average of all the chosen numbers. What number should you choose to have the best chance of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that all the players are rational and will choose a number that maximizes their chance of winning. Let x be the average of all the chosen numbers. Then, the target number to win the game is (2/3)x.\n\nSince all players are rational, they will also assume that the other players will choose a number between 0 and 100. Therefore, the average x will be at most 100, and the target number will be at most (2/3)(100) = 200/3 ≈ 66.67.\n\nNow, if all players think this way, they will choose a number between 0 and 66.67. In this case, the average x will be at most 66.67, and the target number will be at most (2/3)(66.67) ≈ 44.44.\n\nThis process can be repeated iteratively, and the range of numbers that players will choose will keep getting smaller. However, this process will never converge to a single number, as the players will always have to choose a number within a range.\n\nTo have the best chance of winning, you should choose a number that is close to 2/3 times the expected average of the chosen numbers. Since the range of numbers chosen by the players will keep getting smaller, it is reasonable to choose a number close to the lower end of the range. In this case, choosing a number close to (2/3)(44.44) ≈ 29.63 would give you a good chance of winning the game.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there is no guarantee that this number will always win, as the actual numbers chosen by the players can vary and affect the average and target number."
