    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the control system using the Fourier transform method, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function G(s) = 1/(s^2 + 6s + 8). A system is stable if all poles have negative real parts.\n\nFirst, let's find the poles of the transfer function by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\ns^2 + 6s + 8 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots (the poles) using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 8. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4 * 1 * 8)) / (2 * 1)\ns = (-6 ± √(36 - 32)) / 2\ns = (-6 ± √4) / 2\ns = (-6 ± 2) / 2\n\nNow we have two possible values for s:\n\ns1 = (-6 + 2) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2\ns2 = (-6 - 2) / 2 = -8 / 2 = -4\n\nBoth poles, s1 and s2, have negative real parts (-2 and -4, respectively). Therefore, the control system described by the transfer function G(s) = 1/(s^2 + 6s + 8) is stable according to the Fourier transform method."
