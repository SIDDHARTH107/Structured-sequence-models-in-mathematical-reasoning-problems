    "message_1": "Suppose there are 20 students participating in a science project competition. The competition consists of 4 different activities: experiment, presentation, report writing, and quiz. Each student is required to participate in exactly 3 activities. What is the minimum number of judges needed to evaluate the students in such a way that each student's work is evaluated by at least one judge per activity?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the activities as A (experiment), B (presentation), C (report writing), and D (quiz). Since each student participates in exactly 3 activities, we can have the following combinations of activities for the students:\n\n1. ABC\n2. ABD\n3. ACD\n4. BCD\n\nNow, let's find the minimum number of judges needed for each combination of activities:\n\n1. For the ABC combination, we need at least 1 judge who can evaluate activities A, B, and C.\n2. For the ABD combination, we need at least 1 judge who can evaluate activities A, B, and D.\n3. For the ACD combination, we need at least 1 judge who can evaluate activities A, C, and D.\n4. For the BCD combination, we need at least 1 judge who can evaluate activities B, C, and D.\n\nSo, we need a minimum of 4 judges to evaluate the students in such a way that each student's work is evaluated by at least one judge per activity."
