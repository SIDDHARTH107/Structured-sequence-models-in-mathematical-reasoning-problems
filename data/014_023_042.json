    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail Fence Cipher with a rail number of 3, we need to arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows and then read the message horizontally. The given message has 18 characters, so we can arrange it as follows:\n\nT _ _ _ O _ _ _ G _ _ _ N _ _ _ I _ _ _\n_ S _ D _ L _ I _ M _ A _ L _ H _ E _ O _\n_ _ T _ _ _ D _ _ _ O _ _ _ E _ _ _ _\n\nNow, we can read the message horizontally:\n\nT O G N I S D L I M A L H E O T D O E\n\nThe decrypted message is \"TOGNISDLIMALHEOTDOE\"."
