    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nAccording to Brooks' theorem, for any connected graph G with maximum degree Δ(G), the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G), except for complete graphs or odd cycles, where χ(G) = Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn this case, the graph G has 7 vertices and the maximum degree of any vertex is 3 (Δ(G) = 3). Since we don't have information about whether the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle, we can only determine the upper bound for the chromatic number.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of the graph G is at most 3."
