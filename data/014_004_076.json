    "message_1": "Suppose you are using Elliptic Curve Cryptography over the field $F_{23}$, and have the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$, and the base point $P=(7, 12)$. \n\nGiven a private key $d_A = 5$, Compute the corresponding public key $Q_A = d_A P$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the public key $Q_A = d_A P$, we need to perform scalar multiplication of the base point $P$ by the private key $d_A$. In this case, we have $Q_A = 5P$. We will use the double-and-add method for scalar multiplication on elliptic curves.\n\nFirst, let's compute $2P$:\n1. Find the slope of the tangent line at point $P$: $m = (3x^2 + a) / 2y \\pmod{23}$, where $a = 2$ (from the elliptic curve equation).\n2. Plug in the coordinates of $P$: $m = (3(7)^2 + 2) / 2(12) \\pmod{23} = (3(49) + 2) / 24 \\pmod{23} = (147 + 2) / 24 \\pmod{23} = 149 / 24 \\pmod{23} = 6 / 1 \\pmod{23} = 6$.\n3. Compute the new x-coordinate: $x_{2P} = m^2 - x - x' \\pmod{23} = 6^2 - 7 - 7 \\pmod{23} = 36 - 14 \\pmod{23} = 22$.\n4. Compute the new y-coordinate: $y_{2P} = m(x - x_{2P}) - y \\pmod{23} = 6(7 - 22) - 12 \\pmod{23} = 6(-15) - 12 \\pmod{23} = -90 - 12 \\pmod{23} = -102 \\pmod{23} = 10$.\nSo, $2P = (22, 10)$.\n\nNow, let's compute $Q_A = 5P = 2P + 3P$:\n1. Find the slope of the line through $P$ and $2P$: $m = (y - y') / (x - x') \\pmod{23}$.\n2. Plug in the coordinates of $P$ and $2P$: $m = (12 - 10) / (7 - 22) \\pmod{23} = 2 / (-15) \\pmod{23} = 2(-15)^{-1} \\pmod{23} = 2(8) \\pmod{23} = 16$.\n3. Compute the new x-coordinate: $x_{Q_A} = m^2 - x - x' \\pmod{23} = 16^2 - 7 - 22 \\pmod{23} = 256 - 29 \\pmod{23} = 227 \\pmod{23} = 10$.\n4. Compute the new y-coordinate: $y_{Q_A} = m(x - x_{Q_A}) - y \\pmod{23} = 16(7 - 10) - 12 \\pmod{23} = 16(-3) - 12 \\pmod{23} = -48 - 12 \\pmod{23} = -60 \\pmod{23} = 2$.\n\nThus, the public key $Q_A = 5P = (10, 2)$."
