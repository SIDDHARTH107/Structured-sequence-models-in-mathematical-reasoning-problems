    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 7x^2 - 5x + 3 using the power rule of differentiation, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 2x^3, n = 3, so the derivative is (3 * 2) * x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n2. For the term 7x^2, n = 2, so the derivative is (2 * 7) * x^(2-1) = 14x.\n3. For the term -5x, n = 1, so the derivative is (1 * -5) * x^(1-1) = -5.\n4. For the constant term 3, the derivative is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we can combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 14x - 5"
