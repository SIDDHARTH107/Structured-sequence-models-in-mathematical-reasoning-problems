    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one person in the party, say person A. There are 4 other people in the party, so person A must have either at least 3 friends or at least 3 strangers among the other 4 people.\n\nCase 1: Person A has at least 3 friends.\nIf any of these 3 friends are friends with each other, then we have a group of 3 mutual friends (A and the two friends). If none of these 3 friends are friends with each other, then they form a group of 3 mutual strangers.\n\nCase 2: Person A has at least 3 strangers.\nIf any of these 3 strangers are strangers to each other, then we have a group of 3 mutual strangers. If none of these 3 strangers are strangers to each other, then they form a group of 3 mutual friends.\n\nIn either case, we are guaranteed to have a group of 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers. Now let's find the minimum number of friendships required.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, person A has 3 friends and 1 stranger. The 3 friends are all strangers to each other, and the stranger is friends with all of the other 3 people. In this case, we have the following friendships:\n\n1. A - Friend 1\n2. A - Friend 2\n3. A - Friend 3\n4. Stranger - Friend 1\n5. Stranger - Friend 2\n6. Stranger - Friend 3\n\nSo, the minimum number of friendships that must exist in the party such that there are at least 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers is 6."
