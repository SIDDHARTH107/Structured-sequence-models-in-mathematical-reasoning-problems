    "message_1": "A flagpole casts a shadow of 10 meters long. At the same time, the angle of elevation from the tip of the shadow to the top of the flagpole is 60 degrees. Calculate the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the length of the shadow (10 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the flagpole (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 10\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3 (approximately 1.732).\n\n1.732 = height / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the flagpole:\n\nheight = 1.732 * 10\nheight ≈ 17.32 meters\n\nThe height of the flagpole is approximately 17.32 meters."
