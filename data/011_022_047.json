    "message_1": "A student has a backpack with a maximum weight limit of 10kg. They need to pack either apples or bananas for a school trip. The apples weigh 1kg each and the bananas weigh 2kg each. The student wants to pack as many pieces of fruit as possible without exceeding the weight limit. If each apple costs $0.50 and each banana costs $1.00, what combination of fruits should the student pack to have the most pieces of fruit and spend the least amount of money possible?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the number of fruits and minimize the cost, the student should pack only apples. Since apples weigh 1kg each and the backpack has a 10kg limit, the student can pack 10 apples. This will cost 10 * $0.50 = $5.00. Packing only apples allows the student to have the most pieces of fruit (10) and spend the least amount of money ($5.00)."
