Find the smallest positive integer that leaves the remainders specified by the two sets when divided by 5 and 3, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we need to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n\nFirst, let's find the modular inverses. We need to find integers y and z such that:\n\ny * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nz * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nTrying out values for y and z, we find that:\n\ny = 2, since 2 * 5 = 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nz = 2, since 2 * 3 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we can use the Chinese remainder theorem formula:\n\nx = (a1 * M1 * y1) + (a2 * M2 * y2)\n\nwhere a1 and a2 are the remainders, M1 and M2 are the moduli, and y1 and y2 are the modular inverses.\n\nIn our case, a1 = 1, a2 = 2, M1 = 5, M2 = 3, y1 = 2, and y2 = 2.\n\nx = (1 * 5 * 2) + (2 * 3 * 2)\nx = (10) + (12)\nx = 22\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that leaves the remainders specified by the two sets when divided by 5 and 3, respectively, is 22."
