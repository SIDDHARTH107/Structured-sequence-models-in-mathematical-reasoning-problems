    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of tables: rectangular and circular. The company has 120 square feet of wood, 36 hours of production time, and ten employees. A rectangular table requires 20 square feet of wood, 4 hours of production time, and needs two employees to assemble it. A circular table requires 15 square feet of wood, 3 hours of production time, and needs three employees to assemble it. The profit of each rectangular table is $500, and the profit of each circular table is $300. What is the maximum profit the company can make given the available resources?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of rectangular tables and y be the number of circular tables.\n\nThe constraints for the available resources are as follows:\n\n1. Wood: 20x + 15y ≤ 120\n2. Production time: 4x + 3y ≤ 36\n3. Employees: 2x + 3y ≤ 10\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 500x + 300y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. 20x + 15y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (120 - 20x) / 15\n\n2. 4x + 3y ≤ 36\ny ≤ (36 - 4x) / 3\n\n3. 2x + 3y ≤ 10\ny ≤ (10 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersections of the constraint lines:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\n20x + 15y = 120\n4x + 3y = 36\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 3 and y = 4.\n\nIntersection of (1) and (3):\n20x + 15y = 120\n2x + 3y = 10\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 2 and y = 2.\n\nIntersection of (2) and (3):\n4x + 3y = 36\n2x + 3y = 10\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 0 and y = 2.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(3, 4) = 500(3) + 300(4) = 1500 + 1200 = $2700\nP(2, 2) = 500(2) + 300(2) = 1000 + 600 = $1600\nP(0, 2) = 500(0) + 300(2) = 0 + 600 = $600\n\nThe maximum profit is $2700 when the company produces 3 rectangular tables and 4 circular tables."
