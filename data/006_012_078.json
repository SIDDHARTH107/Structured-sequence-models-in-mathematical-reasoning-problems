    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least two burglaries occurring, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, burglaries) occurring in a fixed interval (in this case, the neighborhood with 10,000 households).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (burglaries), k is the desired number of events, λ (lambda) is the average number of events, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nGiven that the average incidence rate of burglary is 0.02 per household, the expected number of burglaries in the neighborhood (λ) is:\n\nλ = 0.02 * 10,000 = 200\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least two burglaries occurring. To do this, we can find the probability of zero or one burglary occurring and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-200) * 200^0) / 0! = e^(-200)\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-200) * 200^1) / 1! = 200 * e^(-200)\n\nSo, the probability of at least two burglaries occurring is:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) = 1 - e^(-200) - 200 * e^(-200) ≈ 1\n\nThe probability of at least two burglaries occurring in the neighborhood is approximately 1, or almost certain."
