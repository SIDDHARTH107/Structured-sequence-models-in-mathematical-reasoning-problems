    "message_1": "Consider the Calabiâ€“Yau variety defined by the following equation in $\\mathbb{C}^3$:\n$$x^3+y^3+z^3+3axyz=0$$\nwhere $a$ is a real parameter. Find the value of $a$ such that this Calabi-Yau variety has a singular point at the origin $(0,0,0)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of $a$ such that the Calabi-Yau variety has a singular point at the origin, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$, and then find the value of $a$ for which these partial derivatives vanish at the origin.\n\nLet $f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3axyz$. Then the partial derivatives are:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3ayz$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 + 3axz$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 3z^2 + 3axy$$\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $a$ such that these partial derivatives vanish at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$. Plugging in the origin, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(0, 0, 0) = 3(0)^2 + 3a(0)(0) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(0, 0, 0) = 3(0)^2 + 3a(0)(0) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}(0, 0, 0) = 3(0)^2 + 3a(0)(0) = 0$$\n\nSince all three partial derivatives vanish at the origin for any value of $a$, we need to check the second-order partial derivatives to determine if the origin is a singular point. The second-order partial derivatives are:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} = 6z$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 3z$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial z} = 3y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial z} = 3x$$\n\nNow, we evaluate these second-order partial derivatives at the origin:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(0, 0, 0) = 6(0) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}(0, 0, 0) = 6(0) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2}(0, 0, 0) = 6(0) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(0, 0, 0) = 3(0) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial z}(0, 0, 0) = 3(0) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial z}(0, 0, 0) = 3(0) = 0$$\n\nSince all second-order partial derivatives also vanish at the origin, the origin is a singular point of the Calabi-Yau variety for any value of $a$. Therefore, there is no specific value of $a$ required for the Calabi-Yau variety to have a singular point at the origin."
