    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is an entire function, it can be represented by a power series converging for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. By Liouville's theorem, any bounded entire function must be constant. Therefore, $f(z) = c$ for some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nSince $|f(z)| \\leq 5$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we have $|c| \\leq 5$. Thus, the maximum and minimum values of $|f(\\pi)| = |c|$ are 5 and 0, respectively."
