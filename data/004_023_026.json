    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 over the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - 3\n\nRearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 3:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 12)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (4 - 12) is negative, there are no real roots for this equation. This means that the two curves do not intersect over the interval [0, 2]. Therefore, we can find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 3 - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we can integrate the function:\n\nArea = [x^2 - (1/3)x^3] evaluated from 0 to 2\n\nPlug in the limits of integration:\n\nArea = [(2)^2 - (1/3)(2)^3] - [(0)^2 - (1/3)(0)^3]\nArea = [4 - (8/3)] - [0]\nArea = (4/3)\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 over the interval [0, 2] is 4/3 square units."
