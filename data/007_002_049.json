    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 123456789 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45\n\nSince 45 is divisible by 9 (45 = 9 * 5), the number 123456789 is also divisible by 9. Therefore, the remainder when 123456789 is divided by 9 is 0."
