    "message_1": "A cube has a volume of 64 cubic units. What is the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube? (Answer: 25.13 cubic units, rounded to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find the diameter of the sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube. Since the volume of the cube is 64 cubic units, we can find the side length by taking the cube root of the volume:\n\nSide length = ∛(64) = 4 units\n\nNow that we have the side length of the cube, we know that the diameter of the inscribed sphere is also 4 units. The radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so:\n\nRadius = Diameter / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 units\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr³\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(2³)\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(8)\n\nVolume = 32π/3 ≈ 33.51 cubic units\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 33.51 cubic units, rounded to two decimal places."
