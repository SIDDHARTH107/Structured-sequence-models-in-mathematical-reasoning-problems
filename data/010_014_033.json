    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group of the compact, connected, orientable 2-dimensional surface $M$ of genus $g$, we can use the fact that $M$ is a closed, orientable surface. We know that the homology groups of such a surface are given by:\n\n$H_0(M) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(M) = \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$, and $H_2(M) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, which states that for any space $X$ and any abelian group $G$, there is a short exact sequence:\n\n$0 \\to \\text{Ext}(H_{n-1}(X), G) \\to H^n(X; G) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_n(X), G) \\to 0$.\n\nIn our case, we want to compute $H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. Applying the Universal Coefficient Theorem with $n = 1$ and $G = \\mathbb{Z}$, we get:\n\n$0 \\to \\text{Ext}(H_0(M), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_1(M), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\n\nSince $H_0(M) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_1(M) = \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$, we can compute the Ext and Hom terms:\n\n$\\text{Ext}(H_0(M), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ (because $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a projective $\\mathbb{Z}$-module),\n\n$\\text{Hom}(H_1(M), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}^{2g}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$ (by the standard properties of the Hom functor).\n\nNow our short exact sequence becomes:\n\n$0 \\to 0 \\to H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}^{2g} \\to 0$.\n\nThis implies that $H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$.\n\nSo, the first cohomology group of the compact, connected, orientable 2-dimensional surface $M$ of genus $g$ with integer coefficients is $\\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$."
