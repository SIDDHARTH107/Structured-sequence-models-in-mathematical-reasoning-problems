    "message_2": "There are five distinct groups of order 8 up to isomorphism. These groups are:\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8. This group is generated by a single element, say a, with the property that a^8 = e (identity element). It has the following elements: {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}. C8 is isomorphic to itself.\n\n2. Q8: The quaternion group of order 8. This group has the following elements: {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, with the relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. Q8 is isomorphic to itself.\n\n3. D4: The dihedral group of order 8. This group represents the symmetries of a square and can be generated by two elements, say r (rotation) and s (reflection), with the properties that r^4 = s^2 = e and sr = r^(-1)s. D4 has the following elements: {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}. D4 is isomorphic to itself.\n\n4. C4 x C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2. This group can be generated by two elements, say a (order 4) and b (order 2), with the property that a^4 = b^2 = e and ab = ba. It has the following elements: {e, a, a^2, a^3, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b}. C4 x C2 is not isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4.\n\n5. C2 x C2 x C2: The direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2. This group can be generated by three elements, say a, b, and c, each of order 2, with the properties that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e and ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb. It has the following elements: {e, a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc}. C2 x C2 x C2 is not isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4."
