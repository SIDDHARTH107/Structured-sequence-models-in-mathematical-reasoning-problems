    "message_2": "To find the image of the unit disk under the mapping w = f(z), we first need to parameterize the unit disk. The unit disk is defined as the set of all complex numbers z such that |z| <= 1. We can parameterize the unit disk using polar coordinates: z = re^(iθ), where r is the radius (0 <= r <= 1) and θ is the angle (0 <= θ < 2π).\n\nNow, let's find the image of the unit disk under the mapping w = f(z):\n\nw = f(z) = f(re^(iθ)) = (re^(iθ))^2 - 2(re^(iθ)) + 2\nw = r^2e^(2iθ) - 2re^(iθ) + 2\n\nNow, let's convert w back to rectangular coordinates:\n\nw = r^2(cos(2θ) + i*sin(2θ)) - 2r(cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)) + 2\nw = (r^2cos(2θ) - 2rcos(θ) + 2) + i(r^2sin(2θ) - 2rsin(θ))\n\nNow, let's find the boundary of the image of the unit disk. The boundary of the unit disk is the circle |z| = 1, so we set r = 1:\n\nw = (cos(2θ) - 2cos(θ) + 2) + i(sin(2θ) - 2sin(θ))\n\nThe boundary of the image of the unit disk is a curve parameterized by θ. To find the image of the entire unit disk, we can consider the behavior of the function f(z) inside the unit disk. Since f(z) is a continuous function, the image of the unit disk will be the region enclosed by the boundary curve.\n\nIn conclusion, the image of the unit disk under the mapping w = f(z) is the region enclosed by the curve w(θ) = (cos(2θ) - 2cos(θ) + 2) + i(sin(2θ) - 2sin(θ)), where 0 <= θ < 2π."
