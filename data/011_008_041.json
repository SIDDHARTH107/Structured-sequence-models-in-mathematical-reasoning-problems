    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. We have 5 balls (stars) and we need to divide them into 3 boxes (using 2 bars). \n\nConsider the following representation:\n- Balls: *\n- Bars: |\n\nFor example, one possible arrangement is **|*|***, which represents 2 balls in the first box, 1 ball in the second box, and 2 balls in the third box.\n\nWe have a total of 5 stars and 2 bars, so we need to arrange these 7 elements. The number of ways to arrange them is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(n + k - 1, k - 1) = C(5 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(7, 2)\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!) = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21\n\nSo there are 21 ways to arrange 5 different colored balls into 3 identical boxes."
