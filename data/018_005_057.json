    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B' = ∅, we need to show that there are no elements in common between set A and the complement of set B (B').\n\nFirst, let's define the sets A and B:\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} (all even numbers between 1 and 10)\nB = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (all odd numbers between 1 and 10)\n\nNow, let's find the complement of set B, denoted as B'. The complement of set B consists of all elements that are not in set B. Since we are considering numbers between 1 and 10, B' will include all numbers between 1 and 10 that are not in B:\n\nB' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B', denoted as A ∩ B'. The intersection of two sets consists of all elements that are common to both sets. Comparing sets A and B', we can see that they have the same elements:\n\nA ∩ B' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nThus, the original statement is incorrect. The correct statement should be A ∩ B' = A, as the intersection of set A and the complement of set B is equal to set A itself."
