The company sells the product at a price function of $P(x) = 60 - 0.1x$, where $x$ is the number of units sold. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can earn and how many units should be produced and sold to achieve this maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we first need to find the revenue function, which is the price function multiplied by the number of units sold: $R(x) = P(x) \\cdot x = (60 - 0.1x) \\cdot x = 60x - 0.1x^2$.\n\nNext, we find the profit function by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function: $\\text{Profit}(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (60x - 0.1x^2) - (0.02x^3 - 1.5x^2 + 50x + 1000) = -0.02x^3 + 1.4x^2 + 10x - 1000$.\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking its first derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(\\text{Profit}(x)) = -0.06x^2 + 2.8x + 10$.\n\nNow, we set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$-0.06x^2 + 2.8x + 10 = 0$.\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = -0.06$, $b = 2.8$, and $c = 10$.\n\n$x = \\frac{-2.8 \\pm \\sqrt{2.8^2 - 4(-0.06)(10)}}{2(-0.06)} = \\frac{-2.8 \\pm \\sqrt{7.84 + 2.4}}{-0.12}$.\n\n$x = \\frac{-2.8 \\pm \\sqrt{10.24}}{-0.12} = \\frac{-2.8 \\pm 3.2}{-0.12}$.\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$: $x_1 = \\frac{-2.8 + 3.2}{-0.12} = \\frac{0.4}{-0.12} \\approx -3.33$ and $x_2 = \\frac{-2.8 - 3.2}{-0.12} = \\frac{-6}{-0.12} = 50$.\n\nSince we cannot produce a negative number of units, we discard the first solution and consider $x = 50$ units. To ensure that this value of $x$ yields a maximum profit, we can check the second derivative of the profit function:\n\n$\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(\\text{Profit}(x)) = -0.12x + 2.8$.\n\nPlugging in $x = 50$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(\\text{Profit}(50)) = -0.12(50) + 2.8 = -6 + 2.8 = -3.2$.\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, this confirms that $x = 50$ units yields a maximum profit.\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum profit by plugging $x = 50$ into the profit function:\n\n$\\text{Max Profit} = \\text{Profit}(50) = -0.02(50)^3 + 1.4(50)^2 + 10(50) - 1000 = -0.02(125000) + 1.4(2500) + 500 - 1000 = -2500 + 3500 + 500 - 1000 = 1500$.\n\nThus, the maximum profit the company can earn is $1500, and they should produce and sell 50 units to achieve this maximum profit."
