    "message_1": "A surface has Gaussian curvature of 5 at each point. If the surface is a closed disk with radius of 3, what is the total curvature of the surface according to Gauss-Bonnet theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total curvature of a closed surface to its Euler characteristic. For a closed disk, the Euler characteristic (χ) is 1. The theorem states:\n\nK_total = ∫∫ K dA = 2πχ\n\nwhere K_total is the total curvature, K is the Gaussian curvature, and dA is the area element.\n\nSince the Gaussian curvature is constant (K = 5) at each point on the surface, we can simplify the integral:\n\nK_total = 5 ∫∫ dA = 5 * Area\n\nThe area of the closed disk with radius 3 is given by:\n\nArea = πr^2 = π(3^2) = 9π\n\nNow, we can find the total curvature:\n\nK_total = 5 * Area = 5 * 9π = 45π\n\nSo, the total curvature of the surface is 45π."
