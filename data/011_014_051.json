    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in graph G, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 vertices, each with a degree of 4. So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 10 * 4 = 40. According to the Handshaking Lemma, this sum is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\n40 = 2 * (number of edges)\n\nTo find the number of edges, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n(number of edges) = 40 / 2\n\n(number of edges) = 20\n\nSo, graph G has 20 edges."
