    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be L and the width be W. The perimeter of the garden is given by the equation:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 120 feet of fencing material, the perimeter is 120 feet:\n\n120 = 2L + 2W\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n60 = L + W\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area of the garden, which is given by the equation:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can express the width W in terms of the length L using the simplified perimeter equation:\n\nW = 60 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W in the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (60 - L)\n\nArea = 60L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 60 - 2L = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n2L = 60\nL = 30\n\nNow, substitute this value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 60 - 30\nW = 30\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden with the maximum area are 30 feet by 30 feet."
