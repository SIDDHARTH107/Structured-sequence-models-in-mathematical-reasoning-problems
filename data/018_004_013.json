    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 5 elements, and let B and C be its complements. If B has 3 elements, what is the cardinality of C?",
    "message_2": "Since A has 5 elements and B is its complement, that means B contains all the elements that are not in A. Given that B has 3 elements, there must be a total of 5 + 3 = 8 elements in the universal set.\n\nNow, C is also a complement of A, which means it contains all the elements that are not in A. Since the universal set has 8 elements and A has 5 elements, the cardinality of C is 8 - 5 = 3."
