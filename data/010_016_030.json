Compute the intersection pairing H_1(A) x H_1(B) -> H_0(A ∩ B) under the assumption that this pairing is nondegenerate.",
    "message_2": "To compute the intersection pairing, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The intersection pairing is bilinear, meaning it is linear in both arguments.\n2. The intersection pairing is nondegenerate, meaning that for any nonzero element in H_1(A), there exists an element in H_1(B) such that their pairing is nonzero, and vice versa.\n\nLet's denote the generators of H_1(A) and H_1(B) as [a] and [b], respectively. Since H_1(A) is isomorphic to Z, we can write any element in H_1(A) as n[a] for some integer n. Similarly, any element in H_1(B) can be written as m[b] for some integer m, where m = 0 or 1 because H_1(B) is isomorphic to Z/2Z.\n\nNow, we want to compute the intersection pairing:\n\nH_1(A) x H_1(B) -> H_0(A ∩ B)\n\nWe can do this by considering the pairing of the generators [a] and [b]:\n\n⟨[a], [b]⟩\n\nSince the pairing is nondegenerate, there must exist some nonzero integer k such that:\n\n⟨[a], [b]⟩ = k\n\nNow, let's consider the pairing of [a] with 2[b]:\n\n⟨[a], 2[b]⟩ = 2⟨[a], [b]⟩ = 2k\n\nHowever, since H_1(B) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, we know that 2[b] = 0 in H_1(B). Therefore, the pairing ⟨[a], 2[b]⟩ must be zero:\n\n⟨[a], 2[b]⟩ = 0\n\nThis implies that 2k = 0. Since k is nonzero, we must be working in a group where 2 is equivalent to 0, which means that the intersection pairing takes values in Z/2Z. Thus, the intersection pairing can be described as:\n\nH_1(A) x H_1(B) -> H_0(A ∩ B) = Z/2Z\n\nwith the property that ⟨[a], [b]⟩ = 1 in Z/2Z."
