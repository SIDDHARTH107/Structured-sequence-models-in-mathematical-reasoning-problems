    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5. The derivative f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is: x1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe start with an initial guess of x0 = 2. We will iterate the process until the difference between consecutive approximations is less than 0.0001 (to ensure accuracy up to 4 decimal places).\n\nIteration 1:\nx0 = 2\nf(x0) = 2^3 - 2*2 - 5 = 8 - 4 - 5 = -1\nf'(x0) = 3*(2^2) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) = 2 - (-1) / 10 = 2 + 0.1 = 2.1\n\nIteration 2:\nx0 = 2.1\nf(x0) = (2.1)^3 - 2*2.1 - 5 ≈ -0.289\nf'(x0) ≈ 3*(2.1)^2 - 2 ≈ 12.93\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) ≈ 2.1 - (-0.289) / 12.93 ≈ 2.1223\n\nIteration 3:\nx0 = 2.1223\nf(x0) ≈ (2.1223)^3 - 2*2.1223 - 5 ≈ -0.0206\nf'(x0) ≈ 3*(2.1223)^2 - 2 ≈ 13.4946\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) ≈ 2.1223 - (-0.0206) / 13.4946 ≈ 2.1235\n\nIteration 4:\nx0 = 2.1235\nf(x0) ≈ (2.1235)^3 - 2*2.1235 - 5 ≈ -0.0015\nf'(x0) ≈ 3*(2.1235)^2 - 2 ≈ 13.5238\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) ≈ 2.1235 - (-0.0015) / 13.5238 ≈ 2.1236\n\nThe difference between the last two approximations is less than 0.0001, so we can stop here. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5, accurate to 4 decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 2.1236."
