    "message_2": "To solve for `x`, we'll first isolate the variable by moving all the terms with `x` to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side.\n\nStep 1: Subtract `4x` from both sides of the equation:\n`4x - 7 - 4x = 5x + 8 - 4x`\nThis simplifies to:\n`-7 = x + 8`\n\nStep 2: Subtract `8` from both sides of the equation:\n`-7 - 8 = x + 8 - 8`\nThis simplifies to:\n`-15 = x`\n\nSo, the solution is `x = -15`."
