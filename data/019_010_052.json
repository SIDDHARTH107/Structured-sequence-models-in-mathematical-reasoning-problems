    "message_2": "In linear logic, the tensor product is a way to combine two objects, often represented as A ⊗ B. In this case, the two objects have categories of ℕ (natural numbers) and ℤ (integers).\n\nTo find the category of the tensor product of these two objects, we can consider the Cartesian product of the two sets, which represents all possible ordered pairs of elements from the two sets. The Cartesian product of ℕ and ℤ is denoted as ℕ × ℤ.\n\nSo, the category of the tensor product of two objects with categories of ℕ and ℤ is ℕ × ℤ."
