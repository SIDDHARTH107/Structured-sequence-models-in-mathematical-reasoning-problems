    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16 and H be a subgroup of G with order 2. Since the order of G is a power of a prime (16 = 2^4), G is a p-group. In a p-group, the center Z(G) is nontrivial, i.e., it contains more than just the identity element.\n\nNow, consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: H is a subgroup of Z(G).\nIn this case, H is normal in G because every subgroup of the center of a group is normal. Thus, we have shown that H is normal in G for this case.\n\nCase 2: H is not a subgroup of Z(G).\nSince H is not a subgroup of Z(G), there must be an element h in H such that h is not in Z(G). Let g be an element in G such that gh â‰  hg. Now, consider the subgroup generated by g and H, denoted by <g, H>.\n\nLet K = gHg^(-1). We claim that K is a subgroup of G with order 4. First, we show that K is a subgroup of G. Since gHg^(-1) = {ghg^(-1) : h in H}, it is closed under the group operation. The identity element e is in K because ge^(-1)g^(-1) = g^(-1)g^(-1) = e. Finally, K is closed under inverses because (ghg^(-1))^(-1) = g^(-1)h^(-1)g = g^(-1)hg, and since h^2 = e (because H has order 2), we have g^(-1)hg = g^(-1)g = e. Thus, K is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we show that the order of K is 4. Since H has order 2, there are two distinct elements in H: e and h. Then, K = {e, g^(-1)hg, g^(-1)g = e, g^(-1)h^2g = g^(-1)eg = g^(-1)g = e}. Thus, K has 4 distinct elements, and its order is 4.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that either H is normal in G (Case 1) or there exists an element g in G such that gHg^(-1) is a subgroup of G with order 4 (Case 2)."
