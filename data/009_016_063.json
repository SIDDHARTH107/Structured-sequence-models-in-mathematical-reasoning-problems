    "message_1": "Consider a two-dimensional rectangular region with dimensions 2 meters by 3 meters. The potential at the four corners of the region is given by: \n\nV1 = 10 volts, V2 = 5 volts, V3 = 0 volts and V4 = -5 volts. \n\nFind the electric potential at all internal points of the region using Laplace's equation.",
    "message_2": "To find the electric potential at all internal points of the region using Laplace's equation, we first need to set up the equation. Laplace's equation for a two-dimensional region is given by:\n\n∇²V(x, y) = ∂²V/∂x² + ∂²V/∂y² = 0\n\nWe can solve this equation using separation of variables. Let V(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). Substituting this into Laplace's equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -k²:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -k²\nY''(y)/Y(y) = k²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) X''(x) + k²X(x) = 0\n2) Y''(y) - k²Y(y) = 0\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx)\nY(y) = C*cosh(ky) + D*sinh(ky)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the constants A, B, C, and D:\n\nV(0, y) = Y(y) = 10 - 15y/3\nV(2, y) = Y(y) = 5 - 10y/3\nV(x, 0) = X(x) = 10 - 5x/2\nV(x, 3) = X(x) = -5 + 5x/2\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we can find the coefficients for the Fourier series:\n\nV(x, y) = 10 - 5x/2 - (15y/3) + (5x/2)y/3\n\nSo, the electric potential at all internal points of the region is given by:\n\nV(x, y) = 10 - (5/2)x - 5y + (5/6)xy"
