    "message_1": "A beverage company wants to ensure that the amount of volume filled in each can of their drink is 355 ml. They take a sample of 50 cans and measure their volumes. The sample mean is 353 ml with a standard deviation of 3 ml. Can we conclude that the mean volume is significantly different from the targeted value of 355 ml? Use a 5% level of significance in your hypothesis test.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the mean volume is significantly different from the targeted value of 355 ml, we will perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 355 ml (The mean volume is equal to the targeted value)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 355 ml (The mean volume is significantly different from the targeted value)\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance.\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the targeted value, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nt = (353 - 355) / (3 / √50)\nt = -2 / (3 / √50)\nt = -2 / (3 / 7.071)\nt = -2 / 0.424\nt ≈ -4.717\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value.\nSince this is a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49, we can look up the critical value in a t-distribution table or use a calculator. The critical values are approximately ±2.009.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value and make a decision.\nThe test statistic t ≈ -4.717 is less than the lower critical value of -2.009. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nAt a 5% level of significance, we can conclude that the mean volume of the cans is significantly different from the targeted value of 355 ml."
