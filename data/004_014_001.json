    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inverted cone-shaped water tank, we can use the method of integration. First, we need to find the equation of the line that represents the cone's slant height. Since the cone is inverted, we can consider the vertex of the cone to be at the origin (0,0) of the coordinate system.\n\nLet's denote the height of the cone as h and the radius as r. We are given that h = 8 meters and r = 4 meters at the widest point. We can use similar triangles to find the equation of the line representing the slant height of the cone.\n\nThe similar triangles are formed by the height and radius of the cone, and the height and radius of a cross-sectional disk at a certain height y. Let's denote the radius of the cross-sectional disk at height y as x. Then, we have:\n\nx / y = r / h\nx / y = 4 / 8\nx / y = 1 / 2\n\nThus, the equation of the line representing the slant height of the cone is:\n\nx = (1/2) * y\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the cone using integration. We will integrate the cross-sectional area of the cone (A) with respect to the height (y) from 0 to 8:\n\nV = ∫[A(y) dy] from 0 to 8\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the cone at height y is given by the area of a circle with radius x:\n\nA(y) = π * x^2\n\nSubstitute the equation of the line (x = (1/2) * y) into the area equation:\n\nA(y) = π * ((1/2) * y)^2\nA(y) = π * (1/4) * y^2\n\nNow, integrate A(y) with respect to y from 0 to 8:\n\nV = ∫[π * (1/4) * y^2 dy] from 0 to 8\n\nV = (π * (1/4)) * ∫[y^2 dy] from 0 to 8\n\nNow, integrate y^2 with respect to y:\n\n∫[y^2 dy] = (1/3) * y^3 + C\n\nEvaluate the integral from 0 to 8:\n\nV = (π * (1/4)) * [(1/3) * (8^3) - (1/3) * (0^3)]\nV = (π * (1/4)) * (1/3) * 512\nV = (π * 128) / 3\n\nSo, the volume of the inverted cone-shaped water tank is:\n\nV ≈ (128π) / 3 cubic meters"
