    "message_1": "Suppose a company is looking to maximize their profit from selling two products A and B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B per day. The profit per unit of A is $5 and the profit per unit of B is $8. However, due to market uncertainty, the demand for each product varies daily and is given by the following probability distributions:\n\n- Product A: Uniform distribution between 30 and 50 units with a mean of 40 units and standard deviation of 5 units.\n- Product B: Normal distribution with a mean of 80 units and a standard deviation of 10 units.\n\nWhat is the optimal production plan for the company to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the expected profit, the company should produce the number of units that matches the expected demand for each product. Since the demand for product A follows a uniform distribution with a mean of 40 units, the company should produce 40 units of product A per day.\n\nFor product B, the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 80 units and a standard deviation of 10 units. Since the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, the company should produce 80 units of product B per day to match the expected demand.\n\nHowever, the company can produce a maximum of 150 units of product B per day. If the company decides to produce more than 80 units of product B, they should consider the additional profit from selling extra units of product B and the risk of not selling them. In this case, the company should analyze the demand distribution and the potential profit to decide whether producing more than 80 units of product B is beneficial.\n\nIn summary, the optimal production plan for the company to maximize their expected profit is to produce 40 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day."
