    "message_1": "Suppose two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a centipede game where they can take turns choosing between \"Cooperate\" and \"Defect.\" If both players choose \"Cooperate,\" Alice earns 4 points and Bob earns 3 points. If one player chooses \"Defect\" while the other chooses \"Cooperate,\" the defector earns 6 points and the cooperator earns 1 point. If both players choose \"Defect,\" Alice earns 2 points and Bob earns 1 point. If the game gets to the 10th round and both players have always chosen \"Cooperate,\" how many points will they have earned up to that point?",
    "message_2": "In each round, if both players choose \"Cooperate,\" Alice earns 4 points and Bob earns 3 points. After 10 rounds of both players choosing \"Cooperate,\" the total points earned by each player will be:\n\nAlice: 4 points/round * 10 rounds = 40 points\nBob: 3 points/round * 10 rounds = 30 points\n\nSo, up to the 10th round, Alice will have earned 40 points and Bob will have earned 30 points."
