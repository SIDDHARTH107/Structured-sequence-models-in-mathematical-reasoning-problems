    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given graph G. The edges are:\n(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,6), (3,4), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (5,7), (6,7)\n\nWe can represent the graph G as follows:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 5\n|         |         |\n5 -- 6 -- 7 -- 4 -- 6\n\nNow, let's try to color the graph using the minimum number of colors.\n\nWe can start by coloring vertex 1 with color A. Since vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1, we need to color it with a different color, say color B. Similarly, vertex 3 is connected to vertex 2, so we need to color it with a different color than vertex 2, so we can use color A again. Continuing this process, we can color the vertices as follows:\n\n1(A) -- 2(B) -- 3(A) -- 4(B) -- 5(C)\n|         |         |         |\n5(C) -- 6(A) -- 7(B) -- 4(B) -- 6(A)\n\nAs we can see, we have used 3 colors (A, B, and C) to color the graph G such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is 3."
