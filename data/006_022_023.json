    "message_1": "In a school of 100 students, 60 are enrolled in a math course, and 40 are enrolled in a science course. If the probability of a student passing the math course is 0.75, and the probability of a student passing the science course is 0.60, what is the probability that a randomly selected student from the school is enrolled in a math course and passes it?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student is enrolled in a math course and passes it, we can multiply the probability of a student being enrolled in a math course by the probability of a student passing the math course.\n\nThere are 60 students enrolled in the math course out of a total of 100 students, so the probability of a student being enrolled in a math course is 60/100 = 0.6.\n\nThe probability of a student passing the math course is given as 0.75.\n\nNow, we can multiply these probabilities together:\n\n0.6 (probability of being enrolled in a math course) * 0.75 (probability of passing the math course) = 0.45\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from the school is enrolled in a math course and passes it is 0.45 or 45%."
