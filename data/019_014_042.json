    "message_2": "To prove that there exist two irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational, we can use a proof by contradiction. Let's consider the irrational number √2.\n\nNow, let's consider the number a = √2 and b = √2. We have two cases:\n\nCase 1: (√2)^(√2) is rational.\nIn this case, we have found two irrational numbers a and b (both equal to √2) such that a^b is rational. This proves the statement.\n\nCase 2: (√2)^(√2) is irrational.\nIn this case, let's consider the number c = (√2)^(√2). Since c is irrational, we can consider the numbers a = c and b = √2. Now, let's compute (a^b):\n\na^b = c^√2 = ((√2)^(√2))^√2 = (√2)^(√2 * √2) = (√2)^2 = 2.\n\nIn this case, we have found two irrational numbers a and b (a = (√2)^(√2) and b = √2) such that a^b is rational (2 is a rational number). This also proves the statement.\n\nIn both cases, we have found two irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational. Therefore, the statement is proven."
