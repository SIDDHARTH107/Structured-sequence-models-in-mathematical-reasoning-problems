    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: chairs and tables. The company has 600 hours of labor available each week and 900 square feet of wood available. It takes 2 hours of labor and 4 square feet of wood to produce a chair, and 5 hours of labor and 8 square feet of wood to produce a table. If the company makes a profit of $\\$10$ on each chair and $\\$20$ on each table, how many chairs and tables should the company produce each week to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced each week. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 20y, subject to the constraints of labor and wood availability.\n\nThe labor constraint is given by:\n2x + 5y ≤ 600\n\nThe wood constraint is given by:\n4x + 8y ≤ 900\n\nFirst, we can simplify the wood constraint by dividing both sides by 4:\nx + 2y ≤ 225\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints. The feasible region is the set of points (x, y) that satisfy both constraints. We will find the corner points of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each corner point to determine which point maximizes the profit.\n\nThe corner points are the points where the constraints intersect. We can find these points by solving the constraint equations simultaneously:\n\n1. (0, 0) - The origin, where no chairs or tables are produced.\n2. (0, 120) - The point where the labor constraint intersects the y-axis (2x + 5y = 600, x = 0, y = 120).\n3. (225, 0) - The point where the wood constraint intersects the x-axis (x + 2y = 225, y = 0, x = 225).\n4. (150, 37.5) - The point where the labor and wood constraints intersect (2x + 5y = 600, x + 2y = 225).\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 20y at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 0\n2. P(0, 120) = 10(0) + 20(120) = 2400\n3. P(225, 0) = 10(225) + 20(0) = 2250\n4. P(150, 37.5) = 10(150) + 20(37.5) = 2250\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 120), with a profit of $2400. Therefore, the company should produce 0 chairs and 120 tables each week to maximize its profit."
