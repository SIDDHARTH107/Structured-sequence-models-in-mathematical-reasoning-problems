    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error of the sample mean. The standard error (SE) is calculated as:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = $10,000 and n = 50. So,\n\nSE = $10,000 / √50 ≈ $1,414.21\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of $72,000. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SE\n\nwhere X is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SE is the standard error.\n\nIn this case, X = $72,000, μ = $75,000, and SE ≈ $1,414.21. So,\n\nz = ($72,000 - $75,000) / $1,414.21 ≈ -2.12\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.12. We can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the probability. \n\nUsing a z-table or an online calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score less than -2.12 is approximately 0.017.\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean annual household income is less than $72,000 is approximately 0.017 or 1.7%."
