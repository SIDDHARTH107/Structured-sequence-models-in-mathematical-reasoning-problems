    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the zero of the function f(z) = (z+1)^3(z-2)/(z-1) at z = -1, we first need to determine if the function is analytic at z = -1.\n\nSince the function is a rational function, it is analytic everywhere except at the points where the denominator is zero. In this case, the function is not analytic at z = 1, but it is analytic at z = -1.\n\nNow, let's look at the zeros of the function. A zero of a function is a point where the function takes the value 0. In this case, we can see that f(-1) = (-1+1)^3(-1-2)/(-1-1) = 0, so z = -1 is a zero of the function.\n\nTo determine the order of the zero, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that the n-th derivative of the function is non-zero at z = -1. Let's compute the first few derivatives of f(z):\n\nf'(z) = d/dz [(z+1)^3(z-2)/(z-1)]\n      = [(z+1)^3(z-2)/(z-1)]' = ((z+1)^3)'(z-2)/(z-1) + (z+1)^3((z-2)/(z-1))'\n      = 3(z+1)^2(z-2)/(z-1) - (z+1)^3/(z-1)^2\n\nNow, let's evaluate f'(z) at z = -1:\n\nf'(-1) = 3(-1+1)^2(-1-2)/(-1-1) - (-1+1)^3/(-1-1)^2 = 0\n\nSince f'(-1) = 0, we need to compute the second derivative:\n\nf''(z) = d^2/dz^2 [(z+1)^3(z-2)/(z-1)]\n       = [3(z+1)^2(z-2)/(z-1) - (z+1)^3/(z-1)^2]'\n\nUsing the quotient rule and product rule, we get:\n\nf''(z) = 6(z+1)(z-2)/(z-1)^2 - 6(z+1)^2/(z-1)^3\n\nNow, let's evaluate f''(z) at z = -1:\n\nf''(-1) = 6(-1+1)(-1-2)/(-1-1)^2 - 6(-1+1)^2/(-1-1)^3 = 0\n\nSince f''(-1) = 0, we need to compute the third derivative:\n\nf'''(z) = d^3/dz^3 [(z+1)^3(z-2)/(z-1)]\n       = [6(z+1)(z-2)/(z-1)^2 - 6(z+1)^2/(z-1)^3]'\n\nUsing the quotient rule and product rule, we get:\n\nf'''(z) = 6(z-2)/(z-1)^3 - 18(z+1)/(z-1)^4\n\nNow, let's evaluate f'''(z) at z = -1:\n\nf'''(-1) = 6(-1-2)/(-1-1)^3 - 18(-1+1)/(-1-1)^4 = -6/8 = -3/4 ≠ 0\n\nSince f'''(-1) ≠ 0, the order of the zero at z = -1 is 3.\n\nNow, let's determine the type of the zero. Since the function is analytic at z = -1 and the order of the zero is finite, the zero is a removable zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the zero of the complex function f(z) = (z+1)^3(z-2)/(z-1) at z = -1 is of order 3 and is a removable zero."
