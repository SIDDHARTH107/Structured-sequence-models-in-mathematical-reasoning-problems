    "message_1": "A researcher wants to investigate the effect of different light wavelengths on the growth of plants. They chose three different wavelengths, 450nm, 550nm, and 650nm. They randomly assigned 20 identical plant seedlings to each of the three groups and exposed each group to a different wavelength of light for 8 hours per day over a period of 30 days. At the end of the 30 days, they measured the height of each plant. Use the data below to conduct a one-way ANOVA test at 5% level of significance to determine whether there are any significant differences in the mean plant heights between the three groups.\n\nGroup 1 (450nm): Mean height = 17.5cm, variance = 1.2\nGroup 2 (550nm): Mean height = 21.4cm, variance = 1.3\nGroup 3 (650nm): Mean height = 16.8cm, variance = 1.1",
    "message_2": "To conduct a one-way ANOVA test, we need to calculate the F-statistic and compare it to the critical value from the F-distribution table. The F-statistic is calculated using the following formula:\n\nF = (MSB / MSW)\n\nwhere MSB is the mean square between groups and MSW is the mean square within groups.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total mean height (M_total):\n\nM_total = (sum of all heights) / (total number of plants)\nM_total = (17.5 * 20 + 21.4 * 20 + 16.8 * 20) / (20 + 20 + 20)\nM_total = (350 + 428 + 336) / 60\nM_total = 1114 / 60\nM_total ≈ 18.57 cm\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB):\n\nSSB = Σn_i * (M_i - M_total)^2\nSSB = 20 * (17.5 - 18.57)^2 + 20 * (21.4 - 18.57)^2 + 20 * (16.8 - 18.57)^2\nSSB ≈ 20 * (1.07)^2 + 20 * (2.83)^2 + 20 * (1.77)^2\nSSB ≈ 20 * 1.1449 + 20 * 8.0089 + 20 * 3.1329\nSSB ≈ 22.898 + 160.178 + 62.658\nSSB ≈ 245.734\n\nNext, let's calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW):\n\nSSW = Σ(n_i - 1) * s_i^2\nSSW = (20 - 1) * 1.2 + (20 - 1) * 1.3 + (20 - 1) * 1.1\nSSW = 19 * 1.2 + 19 * 1.3 + 19 * 1.1\nSSW = 22.8 + 24.7 + 20.9\nSSW = 68.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean square between groups (MSB) and the mean square within groups (MSW):\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1)\nMSB = 245.734 / (3 - 1)\nMSB = 245.734 / 2\nMSB ≈ 122.867\n\nMSW = SSW / (N - k)\nMSW = 68.4 / (60 - 3)\nMSW = 68.4 / 57\nMSW ≈ 1.2\n\nNow, we can calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW\nF = 122.867 / 1.2\nF ≈ 102.389\n\nNow, we need to find the critical value from the F-distribution table. We will use the degrees of freedom for between groups (k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2) and the degrees of freedom for within groups (N - k = 60 - 3 = 57). At a 5% level of significance, the critical value for F(2, 57) is approximately 3.15.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (102.389) is greater than the critical value (3.15), we reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in the mean plant heights between the three groups at a 5% level of significance."
