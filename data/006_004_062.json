    "message_1": "A student plays a carnival game where they have to roll a fair 6-sided die and guess if the number rolled is even or odd. If they guess correctly, they win $10. What is the probability that the student will win if they play the game one time?",
    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair 6-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these outcomes, 3 are even (2, 4, and 6) and 3 are odd (1, 3, and 5). If the student guesses either even or odd, they have a 50% chance of being correct since there are an equal number of even and odd outcomes. Therefore, the probability that the student will win if they play the game one time is 1/2 or 50%."
