    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability method. We will first find the probability that no group of 10 or more people shares the same birthday and then subtract this from 1 to find the probability that at least one group of 10 or more people shares the same birthday.\n\nLet's assume that there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years). We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the probability that no group of 10 or more people shares the same birthday.\n\n1. The total number of ways to distribute the 150 birthdays among the 365 days is 365^150.\n\n2. Now, we will find the number of ways to distribute the 150 birthdays such that at least one day has 10 or more people celebrating their birthday. We will do this by considering the complementary case: distributing the birthdays such that no day has 10 or more people celebrating their birthday.\n\n3. We can distribute the 150 birthdays among the 365 days such that no day has more than 9 people celebrating their birthday. This can be done using the stars and bars method. We will divide the 150 people into groups of 9, and then distribute the remaining people (150 - 9 * 16 = 6) among the 365 days. This can be done in C(365 + 6 - 1, 6) ways, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\n4. The probability of the complementary case (no day has 10 or more people celebrating their birthday) is given by:\n\nP(complementary) = C(365 + 6 - 1, 6) / 365^150\n\n5. The probability that at least one group of 10 or more people shares the same birthday is given by:\n\nP(at least 10 people share the same birthday) = 1 - P(complementary)\n\nCalculating the exact probability is computationally intensive and may require specialized software. However, this method provides a framework for finding the probability that at least 10 people out of a community of 150 individuals celebrate their birthday on the same day/month."
