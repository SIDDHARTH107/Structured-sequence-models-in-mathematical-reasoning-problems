    "message_1": "Two players, A and B, will each select either \"heads\" or \"tails\" by simultaneously showing one penny. If the outcomes match, player A gets one point. If they don't match, player B gets one point. If both players choose randomly, what is the probability that player A will win the game?",
    "message_2": "There are four possible outcomes when both players choose randomly:\n\n1. Player A chooses heads, and player B chooses heads.\n2. Player A chooses heads, and player B chooses tails.\n3. Player A chooses tails, and player B chooses heads.\n4. Player A chooses tails, and player B chooses tails.\n\nIn two of these outcomes (1 and 4), the choices match, and player A wins. In the other two outcomes (2 and 3), the choices don't match, and player B wins. Therefore, the probability that player A will win the game is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%."
