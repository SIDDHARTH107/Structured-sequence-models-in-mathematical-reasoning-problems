    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 * (side length)^2\n\nIn this case, the side length is 4 centimeters. So, the surface area of the cube is:\n\nSurface area = 6 * (4 cm)^2\nSurface area = 6 * 16 cm^2\nSurface area = 96 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 96 square centimeters."
