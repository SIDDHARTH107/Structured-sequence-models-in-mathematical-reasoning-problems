    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series for the function f(z) = 1/(z+3) centered at z = -1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z+1) since the center is at z = -1. Let w = z + 1, then z = w - 1. So, we have:\n\nf(z) = 1/((w-1)+3) = 1/(w+2)\n\nNow, we want to find the Laurent series for 1/(w+2). We can use the geometric series formula for this:\n\n1/(1-x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nIn our case, x = -w/2. So, we have:\n\n1/(w+2) = 1/(1 - (-w/2)) = 1 + (-w/2) + (-w/2)^2 + (-w/2)^3 + ...\n\nNow, we substitute back z + 1 for w:\n\nf(z) = 1 + (-(z+1)/2) + (-(z+1)/2)^2 + (-(z+1)/2)^3 + ...\n\nf(z) = 1 - (z+1)/2 + (z+1)^2/4 - (z+1)^3/8 + ...\n\nThis is the Laurent series for f(z) = 1/(z+3) centered at z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to determine the largest open disk on which the series converges. The geometric series converges when |x| < 1. In our case, x = -w/2, so we have:\n\n|-w/2| < 1\n\nSubstituting w = z + 1:\n\n|-(z+1)/2| < 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n|-(z+1)| < 2\n\nSince the function has a singularity at z = -3, the largest open disk on which the series converges is the disk centered at z = -1 with radius 2, which is:\n\nD = {z : |z - (-1)| < 2}"
