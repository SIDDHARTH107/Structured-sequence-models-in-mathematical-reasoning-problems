    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In this case, the modulus is 11, which is a prime number. Therefore, we need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the equation:\n\n(p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 11)\n\nSince the modulus is 11, we have:\n\n(11-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 11)\n\n10! ≡ -1 (mod 11)\n\nCalculating 10!:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n\nNow, we need to check if 10! ≡ -1 (mod 11):\n\n3,628,800 ≡ -1 (mod 11)\n\nTo check this, we can find the remainder when 3,628,800 is divided by 11:\n\n3,628,800 ÷ 11 = 329,890 with a remainder of 10\n\nSince the remainder is 10, which is equivalent to -1 (mod 11), the smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem when the modulus is 11 is 10."
