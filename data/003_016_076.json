    "message_2": "The general equation for a sine wave is:\n\ny(t) = A * sin(B(t - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, we have:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 5\nPeriod = 2π => Angular frequency (B) = 2π / Period = 2π / 2π = 1\nPhase shift (C) = π/3\nVertical shift (D) = 0 (since it's not mentioned)\n\nSo, the equation of the function is:\n\ny(t) = 5 * sin(1(t - π/3))"
