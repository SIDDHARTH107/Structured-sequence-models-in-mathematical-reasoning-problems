    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the denominator of the first two fractions is the same as the denominator of the third fraction, which is $(x-5)(x+2)$. This will make our calculations easier. \n\nNow, let's multiply both sides of the equation by $(x-5)(x+2)$ to eliminate the denominators:\n\n$(x+2)(x-5)(x+2) + (x-5)(x+2)(x-5) = 10$\n\nNow, let's expand the expressions:\n\n$(x+2)^2(x-5) + (x-5)^2(x+2) = 10$\n\n$(x^2+4x+4)(x-5) + (x^2-10x+25)(x+2) = 10$\n\nNow, let's expand and simplify the equation:\n\n$x^3 - x^2 - 20x + 20 + x^3 + 2x^2 - 10x^2 - 20x = 10$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$2x^3 - 9x^2 - 40x + 20 = 10$\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n$2x^3 - 9x^2 - 40x + 10 = 0$\n\nNow, we have a cubic equation. Unfortunately, there is no general formula to solve cubic equations like the quadratic formula. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In our case, the constant term is 10 and the leading coefficient is 2. The possible rational roots are:\n\n±1, ±2, ±5, ±10, ±1/2, ±5/2\n\nWe can test these values to see if any of them are roots of the equation. After testing, we find that x = 2 is a root:\n\n$2(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 - 40(2) + 10 = 0$\n\nNow that we have found a root, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor. We will divide the polynomial $2x^3 - 9x^2 - 40x + 10$ by $(x-2)$:\n\n$2x^3 - 9x^2 - 40x + 10 = (x-2)(2x^2 - 5x - 5)$\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\n$2x^2 - 5x - 5 = 0$\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = -5:\n\n$x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(2)(-5)}}{2(2)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 40}}{4}$\n\n$x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{65}}{4}$\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\n$x = 2, \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{65}}{4}, \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{65}}{4}$"
