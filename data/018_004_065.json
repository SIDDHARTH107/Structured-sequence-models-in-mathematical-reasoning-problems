    "message_2": "To find the complement of a set A, we need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since the universal set is not provided, I will assume that the universal set U is the set of integers from 1 to 9, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. \n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nBy comparing the elements of U and A, we can find the elements that are not in A:\n\nA' = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, to prove that the complement of A is unique, we need to show that there cannot be another set B' that is also the complement of A.\n\nAssume that there exists another set B' that is also the complement of A. This means that B' also contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since A' and B' both contain the same elements (all elements in U that are not in A), it follows that A' = B'. Therefore, the complement of A is unique, and it is the set A' = {2, 4, 6, 8}."
