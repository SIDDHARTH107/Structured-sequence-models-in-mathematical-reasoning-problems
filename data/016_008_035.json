    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, there are N = 4 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of s = 1/3.\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(4) / log(1/3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.26."
