    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Apply the Fourier transform to the image.\n2. Calculate the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients.\n3. Determine the maximum magnitude value and its corresponding frequency component.\n\nStep 1: Apply the Fourier transform to the image\n\nThe Fourier transform of an image is a representation of the image in the frequency domain. It is used to analyze the frequency components present in the image. For a 2D image, we use the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The DFT of an image f(x, y) of size MxN is given by:\n\nF(u, v) = sum_{x=0}^{M-1} sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x, y) * exp(-j * 2 * pi * (ux/M + vy/N))\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the Fourier coefficient at frequency (u, v), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients\n\nThe magnitude of a complex number a + bj is given by:\n\n|a + bj| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)\n\nSo, we can calculate the magnitude of each Fourier coefficient F(u, v) as:\n\n|F(u, v)| = sqrt(Re(F(u, v))^2 + Im(F(u, v))^2)\n\nwhere Re(F(u, v)) and Im(F(u, v)) are the real and imaginary parts of F(u, v), respectively.\n\nStep 3: Determine the maximum magnitude value and its corresponding frequency component\n\nTo find the maximum magnitude value and its corresponding frequency component, we can iterate through all the Fourier coefficients and keep track of the maximum magnitude and its corresponding (u, v) values:\n\nmax_magnitude = 0\nmax_u = 0\nmax_v = 0\n\nfor u in range(0, M):\n    for v in range(0, N):\n        magnitude = |F(u, v)|\n        if magnitude > max_magnitude:\n            max_magnitude = magnitude\n            max_u = u\n            max_v = v\n\nThe maximum magnitude value is max_magnitude, and its corresponding frequency component is (max_u, max_v).\n\nNote: In practice, you would use a library like NumPy or OpenCV to compute the 2D DFT and the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients. The above explanation is a conceptual overview of the process."
