    "message_1": "Consider a smooth function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with critical points $x_1=0, x_2=-3, x_3=2$ and assume that $f$ has Morse index 1 at $x_1$ and $x_3$ and Morse index 2 at $x_2$. Determine the number of critical points of $f$ that are less than or equal to 4.",
    "message_2": "A critical point of a smooth function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a point $x$ in the domain of $f$ where the derivative $f'(x) = 0$. The Morse index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second partial derivatives) at that point. In simpler terms, the Morse index tells us the number of directions in which the function is concave down at the critical point.\n\nWe are given that $f$ has critical points at $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = -3$, and $x_3 = 2$, with Morse indices 1, 2, and 1, respectively. This means that at $x_1$ and $x_3$, the function has one direction in which it is concave down, and at $x_2$, it has two directions in which it is concave down.\n\nSince $f$ is a function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, it has only one input variable, and thus, the Hessian matrix has only one entry, which is the second derivative $f''(x)$. The Morse index being 1 at $x_1$ and $x_3$ means that $f''(x_1) < 0$ and $f''(x_3) < 0$. Similarly, the Morse index being 2 at $x_2$ means that $f''(x_2) < 0$.\n\nNow, we want to determine the number of critical points of $f$ that are less than or equal to 4. Since we are given three critical points, and all of them are less than or equal to 4, we can conclude that there are at least 3 critical points of $f$ that are less than or equal to 4.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any additional critical points in the interval $(-\\infty, 4]$. To do this, we can analyze the behavior of the second derivative $f''(x)$.\n\nSince $f''(x_1) < 0$, $f''(x_2) < 0$, and $f''(x_3) < 0$, we know that the function is concave down at all three critical points. Between the critical points, the concavity must change for the function to have a critical point. However, since the function is concave down at both $x_1$ and $x_3$, there must be another critical point between them where the concavity changes. Similarly, since the function is concave down at both $x_2$ and $x_1$, there must be another critical point between them where the concavity changes.\n\nThus, there are at least two additional critical points between $x_1$ and $x_3$, and between $x_2$ and $x_1$. Since all these critical points are less than or equal to 4, we can conclude that there are at least 5 critical points of $f$ that are less than or equal to 4."
