    "message_1": "A company's network has 2000 computers. The probability of a ransomware attack occurring on any individual computer in one year is 0.02. What is the probability that at least 50 computers will experience a ransomware attack during the year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (ransomware attacks) in n trials (computers), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.02), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (0.98).\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability that at least 50 computers will experience a ransomware attack, so we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 50 to k = 2000.\n\nP(X ≥ 50) = 1 - P(X < 50) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 49\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 49 using the binomial probability formula:\n\nΣ P(X = k) = Σ [C(2000, k) * (0.02)^k * (0.98)^(2000-k)] for k = 0 to 49\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use a statistical software or calculator to find the result.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nΣ P(X = k) ≈ 0.0334\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 50 computers experiencing a ransomware attack:\n\nP(X ≥ 50) = 1 - 0.0334 ≈ 0.9666\n\nSo, the probability that at least 50 computers will experience a ransomware attack during the year is approximately 0.9666 or 96.66%."
