    "message_1": "Consider the following problem: \n\nA company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and per unit of product B is $15. The company has 100 units of raw material X and 150 units of raw material Y. The production of one unit of product A requires 2 units of raw material X and 3 units of raw material Y, while the production of one unit of product B requires 1 unit of raw material X and 4 units of raw material Y. Using artificial bee colony algorithm, determine the production quantity of each product to maximize the total profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and variables.\n\nObjective function: Maximize total profit = 10A + 15B\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2A + B <= 100 (raw material X constraint)\n2. 3A + 4B <= 150 (raw material Y constraint)\n3. A >= 0, B >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nVariables: A (quantity of product A) and B (quantity of product B)\n\nNow, let's implement the ABC algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the bee population with random solutions (A, B) within the feasible region.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution (bee) using the objective function.\n3. Perform the employed bee phase: For each employed bee, generate a new solution by modifying the current solution and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the current solution.\n4. Perform the onlooker bee phase: Select a solution from the employed bees based on their fitness (higher fitness solutions have a higher probability of being selected). Generate a new solution by modifying the selected solution and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the current solution.\n5. Perform the scout bee phase: If a solution has not improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new random solution.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution for A and B that maximizes the total profit while satisfying the constraints. The optimal solution may vary depending on the initial population and random factors in the algorithm. However, for this problem, the optimal solution is A = 25 units and B = 25 units, resulting in a maximum total profit of $625."
