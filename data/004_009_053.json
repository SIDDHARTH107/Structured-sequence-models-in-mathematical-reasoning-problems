    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x² cos(x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x²\nv(x) = cos(x)\n\nNow we need to find the derivatives of these individual functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x\nv'(x) = -sin(x)\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is given by:\n\n(f(x) = u(x)v(x))' = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow we can plug in our functions and their derivatives:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(cos(x)) + (x²)(-sin(x))\nf'(x) = 2x cos(x) - x² sin(x)\n\nSo the derivative of the function f(x) = x² cos(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x cos(x) - x² sin(x)"
