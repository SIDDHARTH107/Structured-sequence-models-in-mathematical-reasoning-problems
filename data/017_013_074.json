    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. We want to determine the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 18 = 2 * 3^2, the possible values for n_3 are 1 and 6.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let P be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the order of P is 9, it must be isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. However, since 9 is a prime power, P must be cyclic, so P ≅ C9. \n\nNow, consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of G. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup Q with order 2, and G is the internal direct product of P and Q. Since P ≅ C9 and Q ≅ C2, G ≅ C9 × C2 ≅ C18, which is a cyclic group of order 18.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 6\nIf there are six Sylow 3-subgroups, none of them are normal in G. In this case, we can use the semidirect product to construct a non-abelian group of order 18. Let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G with order 9, and let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G with order 2. Since P is not normal in G, there exists a non-trivial homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(P). Since Q ≅ C2 and P ≅ C9, we have Aut(P) ≅ C6. \n\nThere is a non-trivial homomorphism φ: C2 → C6, given by φ(1) = 1 and φ(x) = 3, where x is a generator of C2. This homomorphism defines a semidirect product G = P ⋊_φ Q, which is a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18 constructed above, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
