    "message_2": "To find the volume of the sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the diameter is 12 centimeters, the radius is half of that, which is 6 centimeters.\n\nNow we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr^3\n\nPlugging in the radius (r = 6 cm), we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(6)^3\nV = (4/3)π(216)\nV = 288π\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately 288π cubic centimeters, or approximately 904.78 cubic centimeters."
