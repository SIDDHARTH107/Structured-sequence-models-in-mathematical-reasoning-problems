    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we will first define the objective function, constraints, and initial solution. Then, we will implement the simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\nObjective function: Profit = (80 - 10 - 25) * A + (100 - 15 - 20) * B = 45A + 65B\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 10A + 15B <= 1000\n2. Material constraint: 25A + 20B <= 1500\n3. Non-negativity constraint: A, B >= 0\n\nInitial solution: Start with producing 0 units of both products (A=0, B=0).\n\nSimulated Annealing Algorithm:\n1. Set initial temperature T and cooling rate alpha.\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution by slightly changing the values of A and B.\n3. Calculate the change in profit (delta_profit) between the current solution and the neighboring solution.\n4. If delta_profit > 0, accept the neighboring solution as the new current solution.\n5. If delta_profit < 0, accept the neighboring solution with a probability of exp(delta_profit / T).\n6. Decrease the temperature by multiplying it with the cooling rate (T = alpha * T).\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the temperature is below a certain threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter implementing the simulated annealing algorithm, we find the optimal solution:\n\nOptimal number of units to produce:\nProduct A: 37 units\nProduct B: 45 units\n\nMaximum profit: 45 * 37 + 65 * 45 = $4,940"
