Each can must have a surface area of 100 square centimeters. What should be the dimensions (radius and height) of each can to achieve maximum volume? Round your answer to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "Let r be the radius and h be the height of the cylindrical can. The surface area (A) and volume (V) of the cylinder are given by the following formulas:\n\nA = 2πr^2 + 2πrh\nV = πr^2h\n\nWe are given that the surface area must be 100 square centimeters:\n\n100 = 2πr^2 + 2πrh\n\nWe want to find the dimensions that maximize the volume. To do this, we can first solve the surface area equation for h:\n\nh = (100 - 2πr^2) / 2πr\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the volume equation:\n\nV(r) = πr^2((100 - 2πr^2) / 2πr)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nV(r) = (100r - 2πr^3) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of this function by taking the derivative with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndV/dr = (100 - 6πr^2) / 2\n\nSet the derivative equal to 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = 100 - 6πr^2\n6πr^2 = 100\nr^2 = 100 / 6π\nr ≈ 1.534\n\nNow, substitute this value of r back into the equation for h:\n\nh ≈ (100 - 2π(1.534)^2) / 2π(1.534)\nh ≈ 3.068\n\nSo, the dimensions of the can that maximize the volume are approximately r = 1.534 cm and h = 3.068 cm."
