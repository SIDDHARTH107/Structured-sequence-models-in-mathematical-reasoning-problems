    "message_1": "A ferris wheel with a radius of 25 meters rotates at a constant speed of 2 revolutions per minute. Find the maximum height above the ground level that a passenger reaches.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height above the ground level that a passenger reaches, we need to consider the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which is twice the radius.\n\nDiameter = 2 * Radius = 2 * 25 meters = 50 meters\n\nThe maximum height above the ground level that a passenger reaches is when they are at the top of the Ferris wheel. This is equal to the diameter of the wheel, as the bottom of the wheel is at ground level.\n\nSo, the maximum height above the ground level is 50 meters."
