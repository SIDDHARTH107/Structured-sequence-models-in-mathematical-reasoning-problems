    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is defined as:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nFor the given function f(x) = sin(2πx) + cos(4πx), we can compute the Fourier transform over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 as follows:\n\nF(k) = ∫[sin(2πx) * e^(-2πikx) + cos(4πx) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken from 0 to 1.\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(k) = ∫[sin(2πx) * e^(-2πikx)] dx + ∫[cos(4πx) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where both integrals are taken from 0 to 1.\n\nLet's compute each integral separately:\n\n∫[sin(2πx) * e^(-2πikx)] dx = [-1/(4π²(k²-1)) * (e^(-2πikx) * (2πik - 2πi(k²-1)x))]\n\n∫[cos(4πx) * e^(-2πikx)] dx = [1/(4π²(k²+4)) * (e^(-2πikx) * (2πik + 8πi(k²+4)x))]\n\nNow, we can substitute the limits of integration (0 and 1) and simplify:\n\nF(k) = [-1/(4π²(k²-1)) * (e^(-2πik) * (2πik - 2πi(k²-1)) - (2πik))] + [1/(4π²(k²+4)) * (e^(-2πik) * (2πik + 8πi(k²+4)) - (2πik))]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = sin(2πx) + cos(4πx) over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nIn the context of electromagnetic problems, the Fourier transform is often used to analyze the frequency components of a time-varying electromagnetic field. By transforming the spatial or temporal domain into the frequency domain, we can study the behavior of the field at different frequencies and gain insights into the propagation of waves through a medium. For example, the Fourier transform can be used to analyze the dispersion and attenuation of waves in a medium, as well as to solve problems related to waveguides, antennas, and scattering."
