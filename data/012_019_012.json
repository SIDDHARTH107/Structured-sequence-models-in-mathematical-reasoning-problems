    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a simple graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges. To determine the chromatic index, we can use Vizing's theorem, which states that for any simple graph G, the chromatic index χ'(G) satisfies:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nwhere Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the vertices in G.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in G. Since G has 12 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 12 = 24. The average degree of a vertex in G is 24 / 8 = 3. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 4 (since the graph is simple, it cannot have loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices).\n\nNow, we can apply Vizing's theorem:\n\n4 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 5\n\nWe need to check if it's possible to properly color the edges of G with 4 colors. Since the graph is not given explicitly, we cannot determine this directly. However, if we assume that G is a simple graph with the maximum possible number of edges that can be colored with 4 colors, then we can use the following inequality:\n\nm ≤ (k - 1) * n\n\nwhere m is the number of edges, k is the number of colors, and n is the number of vertices. In this case, we have:\n\n12 ≤ (4 - 1) * 8\n\n12 ≤ 3 * 8\n\n12 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible to properly color the edges of G with 4 colors. Therefore, the chromatic index of G is χ'(G) = 4."
