    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in the graph G, we can use the Handshaking Lemma. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, the degree sequence is 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, and 1. Let's sum up the degrees:\n\n3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13\n\nNow, according to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees (13) is equal to twice the number of edges. Therefore, we can find the number of edges by dividing the sum by 2:\n\n13 / 2 = 6.5\n\nHowever, the number of edges must be an integer, so there is an error in the given degree sequence. It is not possible to have a simple graph with the given degree sequence."
