    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the algebraic curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$ and $y$. Let $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x - 1$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $P = (0, 1)$. \n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(0, 1) = -3(0)^2 - 2 = -2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(0, 1) = 2(1) = 2$\n\nFinally, we can write the Jacobian matrix of the algebraic curve at the point $P = (0, 1)$ as:\n\n$$\nJ_F(0, 1) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(0, 1) & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(0, 1) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-2 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$"
