A line in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ can be parametrized by linear polynomials, i.e., $F_i(s,t) = a_is + b_it$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are constants. The degree of this map is 1, as the maximum degree of the polynomials is 1.\n\nIn general, for a rational curve in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ passing through $n-2$ generic points, the simplest case is a linear space of dimension $n-1$. The degree of this map is 1, as the maximum degree of the polynomials defining the map is 1. Therefore, the degree of a rational curve in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ passing through $n-2$ generic points is 1."
