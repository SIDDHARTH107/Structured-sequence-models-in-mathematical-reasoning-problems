    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces 3 types of products: A, B, and C. The daily production is 10000 units of product A, 8000 units of product B, and 7000 units of product C. The probability that product A is produced tomorrow given that it was produced today is 0.9, the probability that product B is produced tomorrow given that it was produced today is 0.8, and the probability that product C is produced tomorrow given that it was produced today is 0.7. What will be the production of each type of product after 3 days?",
    "message_2": "To find the production of each type of product after 3 days, we need to consider the probabilities of each product being produced on each day. We will use the given conditional probabilities to calculate the probability of each product being produced on each day.\n\nFor product A:\nDay 1: 10000 units (given)\nDay 2: 0.9 * 10000 = 9000 units (probability of being produced given it was produced on Day 1)\nDay 3: 0.9 * 9000 = 8100 units (probability of being produced given it was produced on Day 2)\n\nTotal production of product A after 3 days: 10000 + 9000 + 8100 = 27100 units\n\nFor product B:\nDay 1: 8000 units (given)\nDay 2: 0.8 * 8000 = 6400 units (probability of being produced given it was produced on Day 1)\nDay 3: 0.8 * 6400 = 5120 units (probability of being produced given it was produced on Day 2)\n\nTotal production of product B after 3 days: 8000 + 6400 + 5120 = 19520 units\n\nFor product C:\nDay 1: 7000 units (given)\nDay 2: 0.7 * 7000 = 4900 units (probability of being produced given it was produced on Day 1)\nDay 3: 0.7 * 4900 = 3430 units (probability of being produced given it was produced on Day 2)\n\nTotal production of product C after 3 days: 7000 + 4900 + 3430 = 15330 units\n\nSo, after 3 days, the production of each type of product will be:\nProduct A: 27100 units\nProduct B: 19520 units\nProduct C: 15330 units"
