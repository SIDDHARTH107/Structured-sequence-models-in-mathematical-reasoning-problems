    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to non-monotonic logic:\n\nAssume that you're planning to take two courses, MATH101 and MATH102, both of which have a pass mark of 70%. However, there is some uncertainty about whether you should take MATH102, since you are not sure if you will be able to pass it. Further, you know that if you don't take MATH102, you will not be able to take some of the advanced math courses. Using non-monotonic reasoning, what is the minimum grade you should aim for in MATH102?",
    "message_2": "Using non-monotonic reasoning, we can consider the following:\n\n1. You should aim to pass MATH102 to be able to take advanced math courses.\n2. The pass mark for MATH102 is 70%.\n\nGiven the uncertainty about whether you can pass MATH102, you should aim for a grade that maximizes your chances of passing the course. In this case, the minimum grade you should aim for in MATH102 is the pass mark, which is 70%. However, it's always better to aim higher to increase the likelihood of passing and to account for any unexpected difficulties or errors."
