    "message_2": "A Latin square of order 3 is a 3x3 grid filled with 3 distinct symbols (usually numbers) such that each symbol appears exactly once in each row and column. Let's consider the first row and first column.\n\n1. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the symbols in the first row (3 choices for the first position, 2 choices for the second position, and 1 choice for the third position).\n\n2. Since the first column must also have all 3 symbols, there are only 2 possible ways to arrange the remaining symbols in the first column (the second symbol can be in the second or third position, and the third symbol will be in the remaining position).\n\nNow, the remaining 2x2 grid (bottom-right corner) must also contain all 3 symbols, but one of the symbols is already used in both the second row and the second column. Therefore, there is only 1 way to fill in the remaining 2x2 grid.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct Latin squares of order 3 is:\n\n3! × 2 × 1 = 6 × 2 × 1 = 12"
