    "message_2": "To find the tangent and normal planes to the projective variety at the point [1:0:1], we first need to compute the gradient of the homogeneous polynomial f(x, y, z).\n\nThe gradient of f is given by the vector (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z). Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 9x^2\n∂f/∂y = 6y^2\n∂f/∂z = -15z^2\n\nNow, let's evaluate the gradient at the point [1:0:1]:\n\n∇f(1, 0, 1) = (9, 0, -15)\n\nThe tangent plane to the projective variety at the point [1:0:1] is given by the equation:\n\n9(x - 1) + 0(y - 0) - 15(z - 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n9x - 15z + 6 = 0\n\nThe normal plane to the projective variety at the point [1:0:1] is given by the equation:\n\n9(x - 1) + 0(y - 0) + 15(z - 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n9x + 15z - 24 = 0\n\nSo, the tangent plane to the projective variety at the point [1:0:1] is given by the equation:\n\n9x - 15z + 6 = 0\n\nAnd the normal plane to the projective variety at the point [1:0:1] is given by the equation:\n\n9x + 15z - 24 = 0"
