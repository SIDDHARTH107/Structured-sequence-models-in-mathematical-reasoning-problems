    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is given by the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, there are N = 3 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of s = 2. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2) â‰ˆ 1.58496"
