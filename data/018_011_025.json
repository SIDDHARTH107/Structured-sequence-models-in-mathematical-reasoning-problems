    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {a, b}. Find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) x C where C = {0, 1}. Then find the Cartesian product of A x C and B x C. Show that the first result holds true for the second as well, thereby proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of sets A and B.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {a, b}\n\nA ∩ B = {} (since there are no common elements between A and B)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) x C.\n\n(A ∩ B) x C = {} x {0, 1} = {} (since the Cartesian product with an empty set is an empty set)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products of A x C and B x C.\n\nA x C = {(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}\nB x C = {(a, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0), (b, 1)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A x C and B x C.\n\nA x C ∩ B x C = {} (since there are no common ordered pairs between A x C and B x C)\n\nWe can see that the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) x C is equal to the intersection of A x C and B x C, which are both empty sets. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection."
