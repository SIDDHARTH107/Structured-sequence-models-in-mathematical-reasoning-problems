    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of the reaction (r) using the given rate equation and the provided initial concentrations and rate constant. Since the problem does not mention any change in the concentrations of the reactants over time, we can assume that the concentrations remain constant at t = 20 seconds.\n\nThe rate equation is: r = k[A]^2[B]\n\nWe are given:\n[A]₀ = 0.1 mol/L\n[B]₀ = 0.2 mol/L\nk = 0.005 L/mol·s\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the rate equation:\n\nr = (0.005 L/mol·s) * (0.1 mol/L)^2 * (0.2 mol/L)\n\nr = (0.005 L/mol·s) * (0.01 mol²/L²) * (0.2 mol/L)\n\nr = 0.0001 L²/mol²·s * mol\n\nr = 0.0001 L²/mol·s\n\nThe rate of the reaction at t = 20 seconds is 0.0001 L²/mol·s."
