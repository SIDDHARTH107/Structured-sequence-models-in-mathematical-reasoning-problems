    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 48, we first need to consider the prime factorization of 48, which is 2^4 * 3^1. Now, we will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n1. One 2-Sylow subgroup of order 16 (2^4)\n2. Three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 (2^3)\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n1. One 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3 (3^1)\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of these Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow subgroup of order 16 and one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3:\n   In this case, we have a semi-direct product of the two subgroups. There are 5 groups of order 16 (4 abelian and 1 non-abelian, the dihedral group D_8) and 1 group of order 3 (the cyclic group Z_3). The semi-direct product of the abelian groups will result in abelian groups, so we only need to consider the non-abelian group D_8. There are two possible actions of Z_3 on D_8, resulting in two non-abelian groups of order 48 in this case.\n\n2. Three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 and one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3:\n   In this case, we have a semi-direct product of the direct product of the 2-Sylow subgroups and the 3-Sylow subgroup. There are 3 groups of order 8 (2 abelian and 1 non-abelian, the dihedral group D_4). The semi-direct product of the abelian groups will result in abelian groups, so we only need to consider the non-abelian group D_4. There are two possible actions of Z_3 on D_4, resulting in two non-abelian groups of order 48 in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 2 + 2 = 4 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nAn example of a non-abelian group of order 48 is the semi-direct product of D_8 and Z_3, denoted as D_8 ⋊ Z_3."
