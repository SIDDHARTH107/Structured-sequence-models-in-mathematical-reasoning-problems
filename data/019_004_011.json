At time t=2, the system switches back to state A. Using temporal logic, write a formula that represents the condition 'the system is in state B at time t=1'. Show the truth value of the formula using a truth table.\"",
    "message_2": "To represent the condition 'the system is in state B at time t=1' using temporal logic, we can use the \"next\" operator (denoted by \"X\"). Let's use the propositional variable p to represent the system being in state B. Then, the formula can be written as:\n\nX(p)\n\nNow, let's create a truth table to show the truth value of the formula. Since there are two states (A and B), we will have two rows in the truth table. We will use \"T\" to represent true (state B) and \"F\" to represent false (state A).\n\n| Time (t) | State | p | X(p) |\n|----------|-------|---|------|\n|    0     |   A   | F |  T   |\n|    1     |   B   | T |  F   |\n|    2     |   A   | F |  -   |\n\nAt time t=0, the system is in state A, so p is false (F). The next state (t=1) is state B, so X(p) is true (T).\n\nAt time t=1, the system is in state B, so p is true (T). The next state (t=2) is state A, so X(p) is false (F).\n\nAt time t=2, the system is in state A, so p is false (F). There is no next state specified, so X(p) is undefined (-).\n\nThe formula X(p) correctly represents the condition 'the system is in state B at time t=1', as it is true at time t=0 and false at time t=1."
