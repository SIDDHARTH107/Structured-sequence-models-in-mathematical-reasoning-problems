    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges, we need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges. Without knowing the connections between the vertices, it is impossible to determine the girth of the graph."
