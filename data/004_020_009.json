    "message_1": "A 15-kg box is being pulled up to the top of a building by a rope that weighs 3 kg/m. If the box is lifted 20 meters in the air and the force pulling the rope is 250 N, how much work is done in pulling the box to the rooftop? Use integration to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using integration, we need to consider the work done in lifting the box and the work done in lifting the rope. Let's denote the height of the box as y, with y = 0 at the bottom and y = 20 at the top.\n\n1. Work done in lifting the box:\nThe force required to lift the box is equal to its weight, which is F_box = m_box * g, where m_box = 15 kg and g = 9.81 m/s² (acceleration due to gravity). So, F_box = 15 * 9.81 = 147.15 N.\n\nThe work done in lifting the box is the integral of the force with respect to the height y. Since the force is constant, the integral is straightforward:\n\nW_box = ∫(F_box dy) from 0 to 20 = F_box * (20 - 0) = 147.15 * 20 = 2943 J (joules)\n\n2. Work done in lifting the rope:\nAs the rope is lifted, its weight decreases. Let's denote the mass of the rope per unit length as λ = 3 kg/m. The mass of the rope at a height y is m_rope(y) = λ * y, and the force required to lift the rope at height y is F_rope(y) = m_rope(y) * g = λ * y * g.\n\nThe work done in lifting the rope is the integral of the force with respect to the height y:\n\nW_rope = ∫(F_rope(y) dy) from 0 to 20 = ∫(λ * y * g dy) from 0 to 20\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we first find the antiderivative of λ * y * g:\n\n∫(λ * y * g dy) = λ * g * ∫(y dy) = λ * g * (1/2 * y^2) + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nW_rope = (λ * g * (1/2 * 20^2)) - (λ * g * (1/2 * 0^2)) = 3 * 9.81 * (1/2 * 400) = 5886 J\n\n3. Total work done:\nThe total work done in pulling the box to the rooftop is the sum of the work done in lifting the box and the work done in lifting the rope:\n\nW_total = W_box + W_rope = 2943 J + 5886 J = 8829 J\n\nSo, the total work done in pulling the box to the rooftop is 8829 joules."
