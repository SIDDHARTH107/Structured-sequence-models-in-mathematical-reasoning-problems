Firm 1 is the leader and Firm 2 is the follower. If the demand function in the market is Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price of the product, what will be the price and quantity of the product that each firm produces and sells?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction functions for both firms, and then find the equilibrium quantities and prices.\n\nStep 1: Find the inverse demand function\nThe demand function is given as Q = 100 - 2P. To find the inverse demand function, we need to solve for P in terms of Q:\n2P = 100 - Q\nP = 50 - 0.5Q\n\nStep 2: Find the reaction functions for both firms\nLet q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by Firm 1 and Firm 2, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2.\n\nFirm 1's profit function is given by:\nπ1 = (P - MC1)q1 = [(50 - 0.5(q1 + q2)) - 5]q1 = (45 - 0.5q1 - 0.5q2)q1\n\nFirm 2's profit function is given by:\nπ2 = (P - MC2)q2 = [(50 - 0.5(q1 + q2)) - 8]q2 = (42 - 0.5q1 - 0.5q2)q2\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize each firm's profit function with respect to their own quantity produced. We do this by taking the first-order derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n\nFor Firm 1:\ndπ1/dq1 = 45 - q1 - 0.5q2 = 0\n\nFor Firm 2:\ndπ2/dq2 = 42 - 0.5q1 - q2 = 0\n\nNow we have the reaction functions for both firms:\nq1 = 45 - 0.5q2\nq2 = 42 - 0.5q1\n\nStep 3: Find the equilibrium quantities\nSince Firm 1 is the leader, we will substitute Firm 1's reaction function into Firm 2's reaction function to find the equilibrium quantity for Firm 2:\nq2 = 42 - 0.5(45 - 0.5q2)\nq2 = 42 - 22.5 + 0.25q2\n0.75q2 = 19.5\nq2 = 26\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium quantity for Firm 1 by substituting q2 back into Firm 1's reaction function:\nq1 = 45 - 0.5(26)\nq1 = 45 - 13\nq1 = 32\n\nStep 4: Find the equilibrium price\nNow that we have the equilibrium quantities for both firms, we can find the equilibrium price using the inverse demand function:\nP = 50 - 0.5(Q)\nP = 50 - 0.5(q1 + q2)\nP = 50 - 0.5(32 + 26)\nP = 50 - 0.5(58)\nP = 50 - 29\nP = 21\n\nSo, the equilibrium price is $21, Firm 1 produces and sells 32 units, and Firm 2 produces and sells 26 units."
