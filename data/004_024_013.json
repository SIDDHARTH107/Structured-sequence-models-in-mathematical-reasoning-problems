    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose we have an implicit function given by the equation x^2 + y^2 - xy - 6 = 0. If y is a function of x and y(3) = 2, find the value of y'(3) using the chain rule to differentiate the implicit function.",
    "message_2": "To find y'(3), we first need to differentiate the given equation with respect to x. We have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - xy - 6 = 0\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\n2x + 2yy' - (x*y' + y) = 0 (using the chain rule for the product xy)\n\nNow, we know that y(3) = 2. We will substitute x = 3 and y = 2 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(3) + 2(2)(y') - (3*y' + 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6 + 4y' - 3y' - 2 = 0\n\nCombining the terms, we have:\n\ny' = 2\n\nSo, the value of y'(3) is 2."
