    "message_1": "A company has a manufacturing facility with 350 employees. On any given day, the probability of an accident occurring in the facility is 0.06. \n\nWhat is the probability that there will be at least 20 accidents in the facility in a week (assuming a 5-day work week)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k accidents in n days\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of an accident occurring on any given day (0.06)\n- n is the number of days (5 days in this case)\n- k is the number of accidents (we want to find the probability of at least 20 accidents)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of having exactly 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 accidents in 5 days, and then sum these probabilities to get the probability of having at least 20 accidents.\n\nHowever, it is not possible to have more than 5 accidents in a 5-day work week if the probability of an accident occurring in the facility is 0.06 on any given day. Therefore, the probability of having at least 20 accidents in the facility in a week is 0."
