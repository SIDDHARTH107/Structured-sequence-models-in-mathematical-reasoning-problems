    "message_1": "A ball is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 30 meters per second. Suppose the height of the ball at any time is given by the function h(t) = 30t - 5t^2, where h is measured in meters and t is measured in seconds. What is the maximum height of the ball and at what time does it reach its maximum height?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height of the ball, we need to find the vertex of the parabolic function h(t) = 30t - 5t^2. The vertex of a parabola in the form of y = ax^2 + bx + c can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a), where x is the time at which the maximum height is reached.\n\nIn our case, a = -5 and b = 30. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nt = -30 / (2 * -5)\nt = 30 / 10\nt = 3 seconds\n\nSo, the ball reaches its maximum height at t = 3 seconds. Now, we need to find the height at this time. Plug t = 3 into the function h(t):\n\nh(3) = 30(3) - 5(3^2)\nh(3) = 90 - 5(9)\nh(3) = 90 - 45\nh(3) = 45 meters\n\nThus, the maximum height of the ball is 45 meters, and it reaches this height at 3 seconds."
