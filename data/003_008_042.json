    "message_2": "To find the area of a right triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 15 cm and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 15 * 8\n\nArea = 7.5 * 8\n\nArea = 60 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the right triangle is 60 square centimeters."
