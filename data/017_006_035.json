    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let the order of G be 77, which can be factored as 7 * 11. According to the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p of the order of G.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 7-subgroup of G and Q be a Sylow 11-subgroup of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility for n_7 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup of G. Similarly, the number of Sylow 11-subgroups, n_11, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 11. The only possibility for n_11 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 11-subgroup of G.\n\nSince there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 11-subgroup Q, they are both normal subgroups of G. Now, we will show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q.\n\nConsider the product of elements from P and Q, denoted by PQ. Since P and Q are normal subgroups, PQ is a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is |P||Q| / |P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have prime orders 7 and 11, their intersection can only be the identity element. Therefore, |P ∩ Q| = 1, and the order of PQ is |P||Q| = 7 * 11 = 77.\n\nSince the order of PQ is equal to the order of G, we have G = PQ. Furthermore, since P and Q have relatively prime orders, their intersection is trivial, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic (if there exists an element of order 77) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11."
