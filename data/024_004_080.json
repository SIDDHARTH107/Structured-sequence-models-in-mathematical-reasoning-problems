    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\nS_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nS_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\nS_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nS_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nS_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = <S_u, S_u> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <S_u, S_v> = 2uv\nG = <S_v, S_v> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\nE = 5\nF = 2\nG = 5\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\nL = <S_uu, N> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = <S_uv, N> = 0\nN = <S_vv, N> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\nL = 2 / sqrt(9) = 2 / 3\nM = 0\nN = 2 / sqrt(9) = 2 / 3\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature H:\nH = (1/2) * ( (E * N + G * L - 2 * F * M) / (E * G - F^2) )\n\nH = (1/2) * ( (5 * (2/3) + 5 * (2/3) - 2 * 2 * 0) / (5 * 5 - 2^2) )\nH = (1/2) * ( (10/3) / 21 )\nH = 5 / 6\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1, 2) is 5/6."
