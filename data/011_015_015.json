    "message_2": "Yes, it is guaranteed that in a group of six people, there are either three mutual strangers or three mutual acquaintances. This is known as the Friendship Theorem or Ramsey's Theorem (R(3,3) = 6).\n\nTo understand why this is true, let's consider one person in the group, say person A. There are five other people in the group, and person A is either acquainted with or a stranger to each of them. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least three of these relationships must be the same (either acquaintances or strangers).\n\nLet's assume that A has three acquaintances: B, C, and D. If any of B, C, or D are acquainted with each other, then we have a group of three mutual acquaintances (A, and the two who are acquainted). If none of B, C, or D are acquainted with each other, then they form a group of three mutual strangers.\n\nIn either case, we have found a group of three mutual strangers or three mutual acquaintances, proving that it is guaranteed in a group of six people."
