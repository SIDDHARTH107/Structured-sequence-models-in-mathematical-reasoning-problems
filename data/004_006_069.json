    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x + 2, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 24x + 36\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as critical points occur where the derivative is either 0 or undefined. In this case, the derivative is a polynomial, so it is never undefined. We just need to solve for f'(x) = 0:\n\n3x^2 - 24x + 36 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3 to simplify:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 12 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 6)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two solutions for x:\n\nx = 6 and x = 2\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x + 2 are x = 2 and x = 6."
