    "message_1": "A teacher wants to create a test with 10 questions. Each question has to be multiple-choice with 4 answer choices. However, the teacher wants to make sure that no two questions have the same answer choices. How many possible sets of answer choices can the teacher use for the test?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the first question. There are no restrictions on the answer choices for this question, so the teacher can choose any 4 answer choices. Let's assume there are N distinct answer choices available in total. So, for the first question, there are C(N, 4) ways to choose 4 answer choices, where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second question. Since the teacher doesn't want any two questions to have the same answer choices, the second question cannot have the same set of 4 answer choices as the first question. However, it can share up to 3 answer choices with the first question. So, the teacher can choose 1 new answer choice and 3 from the previous question or 2 new answer choices and 2 from the previous question or 3 new answer choices and 1 from the previous question.\n\nLet's calculate the number of ways for each case:\n\n1. One new answer choice and 3 from the previous question: C(N-4, 1) * C(4, 3) = (N-4) * 4\n2. Two new answer choices and 2 from the previous question: C(N-4, 2) * C(4, 2) = (N-4)(N-3)/2 * 6\n3. Three new answer choices and 1 from the previous question: C(N-4, 3) * C(4, 1) = (N-4)(N-3)(N-2)/6 * 4\n\nNow, let's sum up the number of ways for the second question: (N-4) * 4 + (N-4)(N-3)/2 * 6 + (N-4)(N-3)(N-2)/6 * 4\n\nFor the third question, we will have similar cases, but with different numbers of shared answer choices with the first two questions. We can continue this process for all 10 questions.\n\nHowever, this problem quickly becomes very complex and difficult to solve analytically. A more practical approach would be to use a computer program to calculate the number of possible sets of answer choices for the test, given a specific value of N (the total number of distinct answer choices available)."
