    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method to find the roots of a function. The formula for the method is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nwhere x0 is the initial guess, x1 is the updated guess, f(x0) is the value of the function at x0, and f'(x0) is the value of the derivative of the function at x0.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5, we first find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method with the initial guess x0 = 2:\n\n1st iteration:\nx1 = 2 - ( (2^3 - 2(2^2) - 5) / (3(2^2) - 4(2)) )\nx1 = 2 - ( (8 - 8 - 5) / (12 - 8) )\nx1 = 2 - ( -5 / 4 )\nx1 = 2 + 1.25\nx1 = 3.25\n\n2nd iteration:\nx2 = 3.25 - ( (3.25^3 - 2(3.25^2) - 5) / (3(3.25^2) - 4(3.25)) )\nx2 ≈ 3.25 - ( (34.328125 - 2(10.5625) - 5) / (33.15625 - 13) )\nx2 ≈ 3.25 - ( (34.328125 - 21.125 - 5) / (20.15625) )\nx2 ≈ 3.25 - ( 8.203125 / 20.15625 )\nx2 ≈ 3.25 - 0.407\nx2 ≈ 2.843\n\n3rd iteration:\nx3 = 2.843 - ( (2.843^3 - 2(2.843^2) - 5) / (3(2.843^2) - 4(2.843)) )\nx3 ≈ 2.843 - ( (22.961 - 2(8.087) - 5) / (24.261 - 11.372) )\nx3 ≈ 2.843 - ( (22.961 - 16.174 - 5) / (12.889) )\nx3 ≈ 2.843 - ( 1.787 / 12.889 )\nx3 ≈ 2.843 - 0.139\nx3 ≈ 2.704\n\nSince the difference between x2 and x3 is less than 0.01, we can stop the iterations here. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5, accurate to two decimal places, is approximately x = 2.70."
