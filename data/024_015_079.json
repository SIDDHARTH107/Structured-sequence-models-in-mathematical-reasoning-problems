    "message_1": "Let $f(x,y,z) = 2x^2y + 4xz^3$ be a differential form on a 3-dimensional manifold. Calculate the exterior derivative of $f$.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of the given function $f(x, y, z) = 2x^2y + 4xz^3$, we first need to express it as a differential form. Since $f$ is a scalar function, it is a 0-form. The exterior derivative of a 0-form is a 1-form, which is a linear combination of the differentials of the coordinates, $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$. \n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to each coordinate:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 4xy + 12x^2z^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 12x^2z^2$\n\nNow, we can express the exterior derivative $df$ as a 1-form:\n\n$df = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right) dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) dy + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right) dz$\n\n$df = (4xy + 12x^2z^3) dx + (2x^2) dy + (12x^2z^2) dz$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $f(x, y, z) = 2x^2y + 4xz^3$ is:\n\n$df = (4xy + 12x^2z^3) dx + (2x^2) dy + (12x^2z^2) dz$"
