    "message_1": "Consider a set of 50 students that participated in a mathematics exam. The data shows that the students' exam score (out of 100) is positively correlated with their attendance rate (out of 10) in the class. Using discriminant analysis, determine the attendance rate cutoff that distinguishes the top 25% of students from the remaining 75%.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to perform a discriminant analysis to find the attendance rate cutoff that distinguishes the top 25% of students from the remaining 75%. However, we don't have the actual data of students' exam scores and attendance rates. Therefore, we can only provide a general approach to solving this problem.\n\n1. Collect the data: Gather the exam scores and attendance rates for all 50 students.\n\n2. Calculate the correlation: Find the correlation between exam scores and attendance rates to confirm the positive correlation.\n\n3. Rank the students: Rank the students based on their exam scores from highest to lowest.\n\n4. Find the top 25%: Determine the cutoff score that separates the top 25% of students (12 or 13 students) from the remaining 75% (37 or 38 students).\n\n5. Perform discriminant analysis: Using the exam scores and attendance rates, perform a discriminant analysis to find the linear function that best separates the top 25% from the remaining 75%. This can be done using statistical software or programming languages like R or Python.\n\n6. Find the attendance rate cutoff: Determine the attendance rate value that corresponds to the cutoff score found in step 4 using the linear function obtained from the discriminant analysis.\n\nOnce you have the actual data, you can follow these steps to find the attendance rate cutoff that distinguishes the top 25% of students from the remaining 75%."
