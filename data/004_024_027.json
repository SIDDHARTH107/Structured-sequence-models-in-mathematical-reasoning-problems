    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the implicit function x^2 + y^2 = 25, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nDifferentiating x^2 with respect to x gives 2x. Now, to differentiate y^2 with respect to x, we use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is y^2 and the inner function is y. \n\nSo, we have:\nd(y^2)/dx = 2y * dy/dx\n\nNow, differentiate both sides of the equation:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we want to solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\ndy/dx = -2x / 2y\ndy/dx = -x / y\n\nNow, we can find the derivative at the point (3, 4):\n\ndy/dx = -3 / 4\n\nSo, the derivative of the implicit function x^2 + y^2 = 25 at the point (3, 4) is -3/4."
