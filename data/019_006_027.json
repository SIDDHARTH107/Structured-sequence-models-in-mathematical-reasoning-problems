    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but deontic logic is a branch of philosophical logic that deals with the concepts of obligation, permission, and prohibition. It is not directly related to numerical problems or calculations. However, here is an example question related to deontic logic:\n\nIf \"X ought to do Y\" means \"It is morally obligatory for X to do Y,\" and \"X is permitted to do Y\" means \"It is not morally impermissible for X to do Y,\" what is the meaning of \"X is prohibited from doing Y\"?",
    "message_2": "In the context of deontic logic, if \"X is prohibited from doing Y,\" it means that it is morally impermissible for X to do Y. In other words, X is not allowed to do Y due to moral reasons or rules."
