    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can represent it in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  1  |\n    | 2  4  2  |\n    | 3  6 3.01|\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | 14  |\n    |21.03|\n\nHowever, this matrix A is ill-conditioned, which means that it is close to being singular (having no inverse). This can lead to large errors in the solution when using numerical methods. To check the condition of the matrix, we can calculate its determinant.\n\ndet(A) = 1*(4*3.01 - 2*6) - 2*(2*3.01 - 2*3) + 1*(2*6 - 4*3)\ndet(A) = 1*(12.04 - 12) - 2*(6.02 - 6) + 1*(12 - 12)\ndet(A) = 1*(0.04) - 2*(0.02) + 1*(0)\ndet(A) = 0.04 - 0.04\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe determinant of matrix A is 0, which means it is singular and does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot use the inverse matrix method to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nHowever, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination or row reduction to find the solution, if it exists. Let's use Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Subtract the first equation from the second and third equations to eliminate x:\n\nSecond equation: (2x + 4y + 2z) - 2*(x + 2y + z) = 14 - 2*7\nThird equation: (3x + 6y + 3.01z) - 3*(x + 2y + z) = 21.03 - 3*7\n\nSecond equation: 0x + 0y + 0z = 0\nThird equation: 0x + 0y + 0.01z = 0.03\n\n2. Divide the third equation by 0.01:\n\nThird equation: 0x + 0y + z = 3\n\nNow we have the simplified system of equations:\n\nx + 2y + z = 7\n0x + 0y + z = 3\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that z = 3. Substitute this value into the first equation:\n\nx + 2y + 3 = 7\nx + 2y = 4\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the unique values of x and y from this single equation. This system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, as there is a free variable (either x or y). The solution can be expressed in parametric form:\n\nx = 4 - 2y\ny = y\nz = 3\n\nwhere y can be any real number."
