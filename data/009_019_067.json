    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The given SDE is a geometric Brownian motion:\n\ndX(t) = aX(t) dt + bX(t) dW(t)\n\nApplying Ito's lemma, we can find the solution to this SDE. Let Y(t) = ln(X(t)). Then, using Ito's lemma, we have:\n\ndY(t) = (a - (b^2)/2) dt + b dW(t)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides from 0 to t:\n\nY(t) - Y(0) = (a - (b^2)/2) * t + b * W(t)\n\nSince X(0) = 1, we have Y(0) = ln(1) = 0. Therefore,\n\nY(t) = (a - (b^2)/2) * t + b * W(t)\n\nNow, we can find X(t) by taking the exponential of both sides:\n\nX(t) = exp((a - (b^2)/2) * t + b * W(t))\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that X(t) < 0.5 at time t = 1. We can rewrite this inequality in terms of Y(t):\n\nY(1) = ln(X(1)) < ln(0.5)\n\nSubstitute the expression for Y(t):\n\n(a - (b^2)/2) * 1 + b * W(1) < ln(0.5)\n\nNow, we know that W(1) is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance 1. Let Z = b * W(1), then Z is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance b^2 = 1^2 = 1. The inequality becomes:\n\n(2 - 0.5) + Z < ln(0.5)\n\nZ < ln(0.5) - 1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that Z is less than ln(0.5) - 1.5. Since Z is a standard normal random variable, we can use the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find this probability:\n\nP(Z < ln(0.5) - 1.5) = Φ(ln(0.5) - 1.5)\n\nUsing a standard normal table or a calculator, we can find the value of Φ(ln(0.5) - 1.5):\n\nΦ(ln(0.5) - 1.5) ≈ 0.0668\n\nTherefore, the probability that X(t) < 0.5 at time t = 1 is approximately 0.0668 or 6.68%."
