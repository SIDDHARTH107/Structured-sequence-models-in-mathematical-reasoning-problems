    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 4 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nIn this case, the length is 4 cm, the width is 6 cm, and the height is 3 cm. Plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 4 * 6 * 3\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 72\n\nVolume = 24 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 24 cubic centimeters."
