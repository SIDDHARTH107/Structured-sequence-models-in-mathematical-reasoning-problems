    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node F using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we will iteratively find augmenting paths and update the residual graph until no more augmenting paths can be found. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize the flow in each edge to 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph. An augmenting path is a path from the source (A) to the sink (F) where the residual capacity of each edge is greater than 0.\n\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path by the minimum residual capacity found in the path.\n\n4. Update the residual capacities of the edges and their reverse edges.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's go through the algorithm:\n\nIteration 1:\nAugmenting path: A -> C -> E -> F\nMinimum residual capacity: min(5, 4, 3) = 3\nUpdate flow: AC: 3, CE: 3, EF: 3\nUpdate residual capacities: AC: 2, CE: 1, EF: 0, CA: 3, EC: 3, FE: 3\n\nIteration 2:\nAugmenting path: A -> B -> D -> E -> F\nMinimum residual capacity: min(4, 4, 5, 3) = 3\nUpdate flow: AB: 3, BD: 3, DE: 3, EF: 3+3=6\nUpdate residual capacities: AB: 1, BD: 1, DE: 2, EF: -3, BA: 3, DB: 3, ED: 3, FE: 6\n\nIteration 3:\nAugmenting path: A -> C -> D -> E -> F\nMinimum residual capacity: min(2, 4, 2, 6) = 2\nUpdate flow: AC: 3+2=5, CD: 2, DE: 3+2=5, EF: 6-2=4\nUpdate residual capacities: AC: 0, CD: 2, DE: 0, EF: 2, CA: 5, DC: 2, ED: 5, FE: 4\n\nNo more augmenting paths can be found. The maximum flow from node A to node F is the flow through the sink node F, which is 4."
