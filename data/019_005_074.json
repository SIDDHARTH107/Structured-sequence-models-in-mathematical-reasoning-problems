    "message_1": "Consider the following problem based on epistemic logic:\n\nSuppose there are three mathematicians, A, B, and C. Each of them knows that at least two out of the three of them are wearing glasses, but none of them knows whether they themselves are wearing glasses. They communicate with each other and make the following statements:\n\nA: \"I don't know whether I am wearing glasses or not, but I know that B is wearing glasses.\"\nB: \"I don't know whether I am wearing glasses or not, but I know that C is not wearing glasses.\"\nC: \"I don't know whether I am wearing glasses or not, but I know that A is not wearing glasses.\"\n\nAssuming that each statement made is true and that each mathematician uses perfect logic, can you determine who among A, B, and C are wearing glasses? If so, who is wearing glasses and who is not?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the statements made by each mathematician:\n\n1. A: \"I don't know whether I am wearing glasses or not, but I know that B is wearing glasses.\"\nSince A knows that at least two of them are wearing glasses and A is sure that B is wearing glasses, it means that either A and B are wearing glasses or B and C are wearing glasses. A cannot be sure about their own glasses.\n\n2. B: \"I don't know whether I am wearing glasses or not, but I know that C is not wearing glasses.\"\nSince B knows that at least two of them are wearing glasses and B is sure that C is not wearing glasses, it means that either A and B are wearing glasses or A and C are wearing glasses. B cannot be sure about their own glasses.\n\n3. C: \"I don't know whether I am wearing glasses or not, but I know that A is not wearing glasses.\"\nSince C knows that at least two of them are wearing glasses and C is sure that A is not wearing glasses, it means that either B and C are wearing glasses or A and B are wearing glasses. C cannot be sure about their own glasses.\n\nNow, let's combine the information:\n\n- A and B are wearing glasses or B and C are wearing glasses (from A's statement)\n- A and B are wearing glasses or A and C are wearing glasses (from B's statement)\n- A and B are wearing glasses or B and C are wearing glasses (from C's statement)\n\nFrom the above information, the only common possibility is that A and B are wearing glasses, and C is not wearing glasses. So, A and B are wearing glasses, and C is not wearing glasses."
