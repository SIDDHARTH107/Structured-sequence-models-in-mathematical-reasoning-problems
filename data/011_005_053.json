    "message_2": "To find the value of 7C3, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nnCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n! represents the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nSo, 7C3 = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n(7-3)! = 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\n7C3 = 5040 / (6 × 24) = 5040 / 144 = 35\n\nTherefore, the value of 7C3 is 35."
