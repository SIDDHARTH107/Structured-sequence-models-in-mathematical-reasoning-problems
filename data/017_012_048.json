    "message_2": "To find all groups of order 16 up to isomorphism, we can use the classification of finite abelian groups and the Sylow theorems. Since 16 = 2^4, we know that any group of order 16 must be a p-group for the prime p = 2.\n\n1. Abelian groups of order 16:\n\nUsing the classification of finite abelian groups, we know that there are five abelian groups of order 16 up to isomorphism:\n\na) C16: The cyclic group of order 16.\nb) C8 × C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2.\nc) C4 × C4: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4.\nd) C4 × C2 × C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and two cyclic groups of order 2.\ne) C2 × C2 × C2 × C2: The direct product of four cyclic groups of order 2.\n\n2. Non-abelian groups of order 16:\n\na) D8: The dihedral group of order 16, which is the group of symmetries of a regular octagon. This group is non-abelian.\n\nb) Q16: The quaternion group of order 16, which is a non-abelian group generated by two elements i and j such that i^4 = j^4 = 1 and ij = -ji.\n\nc) The semidirect product of C8 and C2: This is a non-abelian group that can be constructed as a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nd) The semidirect product of C4 × C2 and C2: This is a non-abelian group that can be constructed as a semidirect product of a direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2, and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nIn total, there are 9 groups of order 16 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. C16 (cyclic group)\n2. C8 × C2\n3. C4 × C4\n4. C4 × C2 × C2\n5. C2 × C2 × C2 × C2\n6. D8 (dihedral group)\n7. Q16 (quaternion group)\n8. The semidirect product of C8 and C2\n9. The semidirect product of C4 × C2 and C2"
