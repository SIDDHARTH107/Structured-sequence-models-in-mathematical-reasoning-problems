    "message_2": "To find out how many students do not like either coffee nor tea, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal students = Students who prefer coffee + Students who prefer tea - Students who like both coffee and tea + Students who do not like either\n\nLet's plug in the given numbers:\n\n50 = 25 (coffee) + 30 (tea) - 12 (both) + x (neither)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n50 = 43 + x\nx = 50 - 43\nx = 7\n\nSo, 7 students do not like either coffee nor tea."
