Using Fourier analysis, find the frequencies and amplitudes of the sine and cosine waves that make up the function, and interpret the results in terms of the stock's behavior over time. Also, use the Fourier transform to determine the continuous spectrum of the stock's value function, and calculate the power of the function in the frequency range of 0 to 10 cycles per month.",
    "message_2": "The given function is already in the form of a sum of sine and cosine waves:\n\nf(t) = 5sin(2πt) + 7cos(4πt)\n\nThe frequencies and amplitudes of the sine and cosine waves are as follows:\n\n1. Sine wave:\n   Amplitude: 5\n   Frequency: 2πt => 1 cycle per month (since 2π represents one full cycle)\n\n2. Cosine wave:\n   Amplitude: 7\n   Frequency: 4πt => 2 cycles per month (since 4π represents two full cycles)\n\nInterpretation of the stock's behavior over time:\n\nThe stock's value oscillates with a combination of two periodic components. The first component has an amplitude of 5 and completes one cycle per month, while the second component has an amplitude of 7 and completes two cycles per month. The overall behavior of the stock is a combination of these two oscillations.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the function to determine the continuous spectrum of the stock's value function. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nFor our function f(t) = 5sin(2πt) + 7cos(4πt), the Fourier transform is:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[(5sin(2πt) + 7cos(4πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nCalculating the Fourier transform for this function is not trivial, but we can use the linearity property of the Fourier transform to break it down into two separate transforms:\n\nF(ω) = 5 * ∫[sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt + 7 * ∫[cos(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nThe Fourier transforms of sine and cosine functions are well-known and can be found in tables:\n\nFourier transform of sin(2πt) is (j/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)]\nFourier transform of cos(4πt) is (1/2) * [δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nSubstituting these transforms back into our equation:\n\nF(ω) = 5 * (j/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)] + 7 * (1/2) * [δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nNow, let's calculate the power of the function in the frequency range of 0 to 10 cycles per month (0 to 20π rad/s). The power of a function is given by the squared magnitude of its Fourier transform:\n\nP(ω) = |F(ω)|^2\n\nIn our case, the power is non-zero only at the frequencies ω = 2π and ω = 4π:\n\nP(2π) = |5 * (j/2)|^2 = 25/4\nP(4π) = |7 * (1/2)|^2 = 49/4\n\nThe power at all other frequencies in the range of 0 to 20π rad/s is zero. So, the total power of the function in the frequency range of 0 to 10 cycles per month is:\n\nP_total = P(2π) + P(4π) = 25/4 + 49/4 = 74/4 = 18.5"
