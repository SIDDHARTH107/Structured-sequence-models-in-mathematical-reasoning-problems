    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log(5x + 1) = log(3x + 7) + 1, we can use the properties of logarithms to simplify and solve for x.\n\nStep 1: Use the properties of logarithms to combine the terms on the right side of the equation.\nlog(5x + 1) = log((3x + 7) * 10^1)\n\nStep 2: Since the logarithms are equal, their arguments must also be equal.\n5x + 1 = (3x + 7) * 10\n\nStep 3: Expand the right side of the equation.\n5x + 1 = 30x + 70\n\nStep 4: Move all terms with x to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side.\n5x - 30x = 70 - 1\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation.\n-25x = 69\n\nStep 6: Divide both sides by -25 to solve for x.\nx = 69 / -25\nx = -69/25\n\nSo, the solution to the logarithmic equation log(5x + 1) = log(3x + 7) + 1 is x = -69/25."
