Show that if a group of order 24 has exactly one Sylow-3 subgroup, then it's isomorphic to the cyclic group C24. If a group of order 24 has more than one Sylow-3 subgroup, then prove that it's isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 24. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow-3 subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 24\n\nThe divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. The only divisors that satisfy the first condition (n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)) are 1 and 4. Therefore, there are either 1 or 4 Sylow-3 subgroups in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G has exactly one Sylow-3 subgroup, say P. Since P is the only Sylow-3 subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let Q be a Sylow-2 subgroup of G. Since the order of Q is 8, it is either isomorphic to C8 (cyclic group of order 8) or D4 (dihedral group of order 8). In either case, Q is normal in G as well, because the number of Sylow-2 subgroups n_2 must satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) and n_2 divides 24, which implies n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 3. But n_2 = 3 is not possible, as it would imply there are 18 elements of order 2 in G, leaving no room for elements of order 3. So, n_2 = 1, and Q is normal in G.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G, their direct product P × Q is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, |P × Q| = |P| × |Q| = 3 × 8 = 24, which is the order of G. Thus, G is isomorphic to P × Q, which is isomorphic to C3 × C8 (since P is isomorphic to C3 and Q is isomorphic to C8). Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C24.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G has more than one Sylow-3 subgroup, which means there are 4 Sylow-3 subgroups. In this case, G cannot be abelian, as an abelian group of order 24 would have a unique Sylow-3 subgroup (as shown above). Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nIn summary, if a group of order 24 has exactly one Sylow-3 subgroup, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C24. If it has more than one Sylow-3 subgroup, it is isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24."
