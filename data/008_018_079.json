    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using block matrices, we first write the system in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  5 |\n    | 4  5  7 |\n    | 6  7  9 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 20 |\n    | 30 |\n\nNow, we can use Gaussian elimination to solve for X. First, we augment matrix A with matrix B:\n\n| 2  3  5 | 10 |\n| 4  5  7 | 20 |\n| 6  7  9 | 30 |\n\nNext, we perform row operations to get an upper triangular matrix:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 2  3   5 | 10  |\n| 0 -1  -3 | -0  |\n| 0 -2  -6 | 0   |\n\n2. Multiply the second row by -1:\n\n| 2  3   5 | 10  |\n| 0  1   3 | 0   |\n| 0 -2  -6 | 0   |\n\n3. Add 2 times the second row to the third row:\n\n| 2  3  5 | 10 |\n| 0  1  3 | 0  |\n| 0  0  0 | 0  |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix, but the last row indicates that 0 = 0, which means there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations. To find a general solution, we can use back-substitution:\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\ny + 3z = 0\ny = -3z\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the first row:\n\n2x + 3(-3z) + 5z = 10\n2x - 9z + 5z = 10\n2x - 4z = 10\nx = 5 + 2z\n\nSo the general solution for this system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 5 + 2z\ny = -3z\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
