    "message_2": "To find the intersection of sets A and B, we look for the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 5}\n\nNow, we need to prove that this resulting set is a subset of both sets A and B. To do this, we will show that every element in the intersection is also an element of both A and B.\n\nLet x be an element of A ∩ B. This means that x is an element of both A and B by definition of intersection. Since x is an element of A and x is an element of B, we can say that A ∩ B is a subset of A and A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the intersection of sets A and B, A ∩ B = {2, 3, 5}, is a subset of both sets A and B."
