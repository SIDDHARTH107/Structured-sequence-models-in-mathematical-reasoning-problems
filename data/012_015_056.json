    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges. Determine whether G is connected or not.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 8, so the minimum number of edges required for a connected graph is 8 - 1 = 7.\n\nSince G has 12 edges, which is greater than the minimum required number of edges (7), it is possible for G to be connected. However, just because it has enough edges doesn't guarantee that G is connected.\n\nTo prove that G is connected, we need more information about the distribution of the edges among the vertices. Without that information, we cannot definitively determine whether G is connected or not."
