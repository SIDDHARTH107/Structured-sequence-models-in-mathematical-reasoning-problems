    "message_1": "Consider a Latin square of order n, where each row and column contains the numbers 1 through n exactly once. What is the maximum number of entries that can be removed from the Latin square so that no two removed entries lie in the same row or column, and the resulting square is still a Latin square? \n\nFor example, in a Latin square of order 3, we can remove at most 3 entries in this way.",
    "message_2": "Let's consider a Latin square of order n. To maximize the number of removed entries without having two removed entries in the same row or column, we can remove exactly one entry from each row and each column. This means we can remove n entries in total.\n\nNow, let's prove that the resulting square is still a Latin square. After removing n entries, there are n(n-1) entries left in the square. Each row and column still contains n-1 distinct numbers, and no number appears twice in the same row or column.\n\nSince there are n rows and n columns, there are n(n-1) possible positions for the remaining entries. Since each of the n numbers appears exactly n-1 times in the remaining entries, there are n(n-1) remaining entries in total. Therefore, the remaining entries form a Latin square.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of entries that can be removed from a Latin square of order n so that no two removed entries lie in the same row or column, and the resulting square is still a Latin square, is n."
