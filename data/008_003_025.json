    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to get it into row-echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n    1  2  3\n    4  5  6\n    7  8  9\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 7 times the first row from the third row:\n\n    1  2  3\n    0 -3 -6\n    0 -6 -12\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3:\n\n    1  2   3\n    0  1   2\n    0 -6 -12\n\nStep 3: Add 6 times the second row to the third row:\n\n    1  2  3\n    0  1  2\n    0  0  0\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form:\n\n    1  2  3\n    0  1  2\n    0  0  0\n\nThere are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of matrix A is 2."
