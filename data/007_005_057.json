    "message_2": "To find the smallest number that is divisible by 12, 18, and 24, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of each number:\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:\n2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, the smallest number that is divisible by 12, 18, and 24 is 72."
