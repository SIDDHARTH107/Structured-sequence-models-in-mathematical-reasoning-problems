    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a right circular cone, we need to find the lateral surface area and the base area, and then add them together.\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cone can be found using the formula: LSA = πr * l, where r is the radius and l is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l). Since the cone is a right circular cone, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height: l^2 = r^2 + h^2, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone.\n\nGiven radius (r) = 5 cm and height (h) = 12 cm, we can find the slant height (l):\n\nl^2 = (5^2) + (12^2)\nl^2 = 25 + 144\nl^2 = 169\nl = √169\nl = 13 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area (LSA):\n\nLSA = π * 5 * 13\nLSA = 65π cm²\n\nNext, we need to find the base area of the cone. The base is a circle, so we can use the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr^2.\n\nBase Area = π * (5^2)\nBase Area = 25π cm²\n\nNow we can find the total surface area by adding the lateral surface area and the base area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = LSA + Base Area\nTotal Surface Area = 65π + 25π\nTotal Surface Area = 90π cm²\n\nTo get the answer rounded to two decimal places, we can multiply 90π by the value of π (approximately 3.14):\n\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 90 * 3.14\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 282.6 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the right circular cone is approximately 282.6 cm², rounded to two decimal places."
