    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, n! is the factorial of n, and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 6 (the total number of people) and k = 3 (the number of people in the committee).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(6, 3) = (720) / (6 × 6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 different committees that can be formed."
