How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall? (Assume the floor is horizontal)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the floor. We are given that dx/dt = 2 ft/s (the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall).\n\nWe know that the length of the ladder is constant, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\nx^2 + y^2 = 100\n\nNow we need to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 6 ft. To do this, we can differentiate the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe know that dx/dt = 2 ft/s and x = 6 ft. We can find y when x = 6 ft using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 100\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n16(dy/dt) = -24\ndy/dt = -24/16\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 ft/s (negative sign indicates the downward direction) when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall."
