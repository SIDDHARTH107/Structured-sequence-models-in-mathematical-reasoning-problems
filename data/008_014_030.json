    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |\n    | 2  3  1 |\n    | 3  5  2 |\n\nb = | 6  |\n    | 14 |\n    | 22 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process where A is factored into the product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (e.g., Python, MATLAB), we obtain:\n\nQ = | -0.27  0.82  0.50 |\n    | -0.53 -0.41  0.74 |\n    | -0.80 -0.41 -0.44 |\n\nR = | -3.74 -6.07 -2.16 |\n    |  0   -1.64 -0.82 |\n    |  0    0    0.41  |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^T * b, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nQ^T * b = | -0.27  0.82  0.50 |   |  6  |   | -14.00 |\n          | -0.53 -0.41  0.74 | * | 14 | = |   2.00 |\n          | -0.80 -0.41 -0.44 |   | 22 |   |   8.00 |\n\nNow, we solve the upper triangular system Rx = | -14.00 |\n                                               |   2.00 |\n                                               |   8.00 |\n\nUsing back-substitution, we find:\n\nz = 8.00 / 0.41 ≈ 19.51\ny = (2.00 + 0.82 * 19.51) / -1.64 ≈ -10.00\nx = (-14.00 + 6.07 * -10.00 + 2.16 * 19.51) / -3.74 ≈ 1.00\n\nRounding off the solution values to 2 decimal places, we get:\n\nx ≈ 1.00\ny ≈ -10.00\nz ≈ 19.51"
