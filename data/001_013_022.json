    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation sqrt(x-7) + 2 = 5, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the radical term.\nSubtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\nsqrt(x-7) = 5 - 2\nsqrt(x-7) = 3\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n(sqrt(x-7))^2 = 3^2\nx - 7 = 9\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nAdd 7 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 9 + 7\nx = 16\n\nSo, the solution to the radical equation sqrt(x-7) + 2 = 5 is x = 16."
