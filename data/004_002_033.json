    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x - 2) / (x^2 - 1) as x approaches 1, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe numerator can be factored as follows:\n2x^2 + 3x - 2 = (2x - 1)(x + 2)\n\nThe denominator can be factored as a difference of squares:\nx^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\nf(x) = [(2x - 1)(x + 2)] / [(x - 1)(x + 1)]\n\nNow, we can see that there is a common factor of (x - 1) in both the numerator and the denominator. However, we cannot cancel out this factor directly, as it would lead to division by zero when x = 1. Instead, we can find the limit as x approaches 1.\n\nlim (x -> 1) [(2x - 1)(x + 2)] / [(x - 1)(x + 1)]\n\nSince the function is continuous everywhere except x = 1, we can evaluate the limit by plugging in x = 1:\n\n[(2(1) - 1)(1 + 2)] / [(1 - 1)(1 + 1)] = [(1)(3)] / [(0)(2)] = 3/0\n\nHowever, division by zero is undefined. Therefore, the limit does not exist as x approaches 1."
