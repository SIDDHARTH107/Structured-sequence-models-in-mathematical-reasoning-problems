    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x + 3)/(x - 1) using the quotient rule, we need to apply the formula:\n\nf'(x) = (g(x) * h'(x) - g'(x) * h(x)) / [h(x)]^2\n\nwhere f(x) = g(x) / h(x). In this case, g(x) = 2x + 3 and h(x) = x - 1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d(2x + 3)/dx = 2\nh'(x) = d(x - 1)/dx = 1\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule formula:\n\nf'(x) = [(2x + 3) * 1 - 2 * (x - 1)] / (x - 1)^2\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 3 - 2x + 2) / (x - 1)^2\n\nf'(x) = (5) / (x - 1)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 5 / (2 - 1)^2\n\nf'(2) = 5 / 1^2\n\nf'(2) = 5\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x + 3)/(x - 1) at the point x = 2 is 5."
