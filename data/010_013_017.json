    "message_1": "Consider a vector bundle over a topological space $X$ where the fiber over each point in $X$ is $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Suppose that this vector bundle is trivial, i.e., there exists a homeomorphism between $X\\times\\mathbb{R}^3$ and the vector bundle. If the rank of the vector bundle is $2$, find the Chern class of this vector bundle.",
    "message_2": "Since the given vector bundle is trivial, it is isomorphic to the product bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. However, the rank of the vector bundle is given to be $2$, which means that we should consider a rank-$2$ subbundle of the trivial bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. Let's denote this rank-$2$ subbundle as $E$.\n\nNow, we want to find the Chern class of the vector bundle $E$. Since $E$ is a real vector bundle, we should consider its complexification, which is a complex vector bundle of rank $2$. Let's denote this complexification as $E_\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe Chern classes are defined for complex vector bundles, so we will compute the Chern class of $E_\\mathbb{C}$. Since $E_\\mathbb{C}$ is the complexification of a real vector bundle, its Chern classes will be even. In particular, the first Chern class $c_1(E_\\mathbb{C})$ will be zero.\n\nNow, let's consider the second Chern class $c_2(E_\\mathbb{C})$. Since $E_\\mathbb{C}$ is a rank-$2$ complex vector bundle, the total Chern class of $E_\\mathbb{C}$ is given by $c(E_\\mathbb{C}) = 1 + c_1(E_\\mathbb{C}) + c_2(E_\\mathbb{C})$. As we already know that $c_1(E_\\mathbb{C}) = 0$, we have $c(E_\\mathbb{C}) = 1 + c_2(E_\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nHowever, we also know that the total Chern class of a trivial complex vector bundle is $1$. Since $E_\\mathbb{C}$ is the complexification of a subbundle of the trivial bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$, we can conclude that $c(E_\\mathbb{C}) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, we have $1 + c_2(E_\\mathbb{C}) = 1$, which implies that $c_2(E_\\mathbb{C}) = 0$. So, the Chern class of the given rank-$2$ vector bundle $E$ is $(0, 0)$."
