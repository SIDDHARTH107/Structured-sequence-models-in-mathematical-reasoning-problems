    "message_1": "In a two-player ultimatum game, player 1 is given $10 to share between themselves and player 2. Player 1 proposes a division of the money, and player 2 can either accept the proposal or reject it. If player 2 accepts, the money is divided according to the proposal. If player 2 rejects, neither player gets any money. What is the mathematical optimal proposal for player 1 if they want to maximize their own payoff, and what is the lowest possible amount that player 1 can offer without player 2 rejecting it?",
    "message_2": "In the ultimatum game, the optimal proposal for player 1 depends on the rationality and preferences of player 2. If player 2 is perfectly rational and only cares about maximizing their own payoff, then player 1 can offer the smallest possible amount greater than $0, say $0.01, and player 2 will accept it. This is because player 2 would prefer to get $0.01 rather than nothing at all. In this case, the optimal proposal for player 1 would be $9.99 for themselves and $0.01 for player 2.\n\nHowever, in reality, people often exhibit fairness preferences and may reject offers that they perceive as unfair, even if it means getting nothing. In this case, the optimal proposal for player 1 would be to offer a more equitable split, such as $5 for each player, to maximize the likelihood that player 2 will accept the offer.\n\nIn summary, the mathematical optimal proposal for player 1 depends on the assumptions made about player 2's preferences and rationality. If player 2 is perfectly rational and only cares about maximizing their own payoff, the lowest possible amount that player 1 can offer without player 2 rejecting it is $0.01. However, if player 2 has fairness preferences, the optimal proposal for player 1 would be a more equitable split, such as $5 for each player."
