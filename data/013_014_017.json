    "message_1": "Consider a mechanism design problem with three agents, A, B and C, and one item for sale. Each agent has a private valuation for the item as follows:\n\nAgent A: 10\nAgent B: 15\nAgent C: 20\n\nThe mechanism designer wants to design a mechanism that maximizes social welfare. Determine the optimal mechanism and the resulting social welfare.",
    "message_2": "To maximize social welfare, the mechanism designer should allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation. In this case, Agent C has the highest valuation for the item at 20. Therefore, the optimal mechanism would be to allocate the item to Agent C.\n\nThe resulting social welfare would be the sum of the valuations of all agents who receive the item, which in this case is just Agent C. So, the social welfare is 20."
