The distances between the facilities are provided in the table below:\n\n|   | A | B | C | D | E |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 0 | 4 | 9 | 7 | 5 |\n| B | 4 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 1 |\n| C | 9 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 8 |\n| D | 7 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 3 |\n| E | 5 | 1 | 8 | 3 | 0 |\n\nThe company wants to determine the minimum cost of building highways to connect their facilities. The cost of building a highway between two facilities is proportional to the distance between the two facilities. Assuming that every facility will be connected to every other facility, formulate this as an optimization problem and find the minimum cost.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the minimum spanning tree algorithm, which will help us find the minimum cost to connect all facilities without forming any cycles. One such algorithm is Kruskal's algorithm.\n\nFirst, let's list all the edges (highways) and their distances (costs):\n\n1. A-B: 4\n2. A-C: 9\n3. A-D: 7\n4. A-E: 5\n5. B-C: 2\n6. B-D: 3\n7. B-E: 1\n8. C-D: 4\n9. C-E: 8\n10. D-E: 3\n\nNow, sort the edges by their distances:\n\n1. B-E: 1\n2. B-C: 2\n3. B-D: 3\n4. D-E: 3\n5. A-B: 4\n6. C-D: 4\n7. A-E: 5\n8. A-D: 7\n9. C-E: 8\n10. A-C: 9\n\nNext, apply Kruskal's algorithm:\n\n1. Add the shortest edge (B-E) to the solution.\n2. Add the next shortest edge (B-C) to the solution.\n3. Add the next shortest edge (B-D) to the solution.\n4. The next shortest edge (D-E) would form a cycle, so skip it.\n5. Add the next shortest edge (A-B) to the solution.\n6. The next shortest edge (C-D) would form a cycle, so skip it.\n7. All facilities are now connected, so the algorithm is complete.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree consists of the edges B-E, B-C, B-D, and A-B. The minimum cost is the sum of the distances of these edges:\n\n1 (B-E) + 2 (B-C) + 3 (B-D) + 4 (A-B) = 10\n\nSo, the minimum cost of building highways to connect all facilities is 10."
