    "message_2": "The three-point backward difference formula for estimating the derivative of a function is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x-2h) - 4f(x-h) + 3f(x)) / (2h)\n\nIn this case, we have f(x) = x^2, x = 1, and h = 0.1. We can plug these values into the formula to estimate f'(1):\n\nf'(1) ≈ (f(1 - 2(0.1)) - 4f(1 - 0.1) + 3f(1)) / (2(0.1))\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the function values:\n\nf(0.8) = (0.8)^2 = 0.64\nf(0.9) = (0.9)^2 = 0.81\nf(1) = (1)^2 = 1\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (0.64 - 4(0.81) + 3(1)) / (2(0.1))\n\nf'(1) ≈ (0.64 - 3.24 + 3) / 0.2\n\nf'(1) ≈ (0.4) / 0.2\n\nf'(1) ≈ 2\n\nSo, using the three-point backward difference formula with a step size of 0.1, the numerical value of f'(1) for the function f(x) = x^2 is approximately 2."
