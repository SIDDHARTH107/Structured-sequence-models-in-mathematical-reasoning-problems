    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we don't have the angle given in the problem. So, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then use the inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle.\n\nLet's denote the base as 'a', the height as 'b', and the hypotenuse as 'c'. We have:\n\na = 12 cm\nb = 8 cm\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = (12)^2 + (8)^2\nc^2 = 144 + 64\nc^2 = 208\nc = √208\nc ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nNow, we can use the inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle. Let's find angle A (opposite to side a):\n\nsin(A) = opposite/hypotenuse\nsin(A) = a/c\nsin(A) = 12/14.42\nA = arcsin(12/14.42)\nA ≈ 56.44°\n\nNow we can use the formula for the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 8 * sin(56.44°)\nArea ≈ 48 * 0.834\nArea ≈ 40.03 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 40.03 cm²."
