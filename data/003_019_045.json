    "message_2": "To find the integral of the trigonometric function f(x) = sin(x)cos(x) from 0 to π/4, we can use integration by substitution. Let's use the substitution:\n\nu = sin(x)\ndu/dx = cos(x)\ndx = du/cos(x)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral:\n\n∫sin(x)cos(x) dx = ∫u du\n\nNow we need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nx = 0 => u = sin(0) = 0\nx = π/4 => u = sin(π/4) = √2/2\n\nSo, the new integral becomes:\n\n∫[0 to √2/2] u du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n∫u du = (1/2)u^2 + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n\n[(1/2)(√2/2)^2] - [(1/2)(0)^2] = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nSo, the integral of the trigonometric function f(x) = sin(x)cos(x) from 0 to π/4 is 1/4."
