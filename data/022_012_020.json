    "message_2": "To find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z = -3$, we first need to know if $f(z)$ has a pole at $z = -3$. Unfortunately, the information given is not enough to determine the complete form of the meromorphic function $f(z)$. We only know that it has a simple pole at $z = 2$ with residue $4$, and the values of $f(0)$ and $f(1)$.\n\nWithout more information about the function $f(z)$, we cannot determine the residue of $f(z)$ at $z = -3$."
