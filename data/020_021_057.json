    "message_1": "A factory is producing two types of products, A and B. To produce one unit of A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while to produce one unit of B requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. The factory has 150 labor hours and 100 machine-hours available per week. The profit per unit for A is $90 and for B is $60. How many units of A and B should the factory produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 150 (labor hours constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 100 (machine hours constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\n\nP = 90x + 60y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints for y:\n\ny ≤ (150 - 3x)/2\ny ≤ 100 - 2x\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by setting the constraints equal to each other:\n\n(150 - 3x)/2 = 100 - 2x\n150 - 3x = 200 - 4x\nx = 50\n\nNow, substitute x back into one of the constraints to find y:\n\ny = 100 - 2(50)\ny = 0\n\nSo, one vertex is (50, 0).\n\nNow, we will find the other vertex by setting y = 0 in the labor constraint:\n\n3x + 2(0) = 150\nx = 50\n\nNow, substitute x back into the machine constraint to find y:\n\n2(50) + y = 100\ny = 0\n\nSo, the other vertex is also (50, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at the vertex (50, 0):\n\nP = 90(50) + 60(0)\nP = 4500\n\nThus, the factory should produce 50 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize its profit, which will be $4500 per week."
