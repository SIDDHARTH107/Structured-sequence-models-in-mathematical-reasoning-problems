    "message_1": "A company sells its product for $30 per unit. The production cost of each unit is $15 plus a fixed cost of $500. The company wants to maximize its profit. What is the optimal number of units the company should produce and sell to earn maximum profit and what will be the maximum profit earned?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units produced and sold. The revenue function is R(x) = 30x, and the cost function is C(x) = 15x + 500. The profit function, P(x), is the difference between the revenue and cost functions: P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 30x - (15x + 500) = 15x - 500.\n\nTo find the optimal number of units to produce and sell to maximize profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. Since P(x) is a linear function, it does not have any critical points (i.e., points where the derivative is zero or undefined). However, we can still analyze the behavior of the profit function.\n\nAs x increases, the profit function P(x) = 15x - 500 increases linearly. This means that the more units the company produces and sells, the higher the profit will be. However, there is likely a practical limit to the number of units the company can produce and sell, which would depend on factors such as market demand, production capacity, and competition.\n\nWithout information on these factors, we cannot determine the exact optimal number of units to produce and sell to maximize profit. However, we can conclude that the company should aim to produce and sell as many units as possible within the constraints of their market and production capabilities.\n\nTo find the maximum profit earned, we would need to know the maximum number of units the company can produce and sell. Once we have that value, we can plug it into the profit function P(x) = 15x - 500 to calculate the maximum profit."
