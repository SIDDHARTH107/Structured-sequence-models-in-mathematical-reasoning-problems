Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to solving ordinary differential equations using Runge-Kutta methods:\n\nConsider the first-order ordinary differential equation: \n\ndy/dx = -x^2 + x - 1\n\nwith initial condition y(0) = 0. Using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method and a step size of 0.1, approximate the value of y(0.4) to three decimal places.",
