    "message_2": "To find the intersection points, we need to substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the curve.\n\nSince x = y = -z, we can substitute these values into the curve equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0\n(-z)^2 + (-z)^2 + z^2 = 0\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\nz^2 + z^2 + z^2 = 0\n3z^2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\nz^2 = 0\nz = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can find the values of x and y using the line equation:\n\nx = y = -z\nx = y = 0\n\nSo, the intersection point of the curve and the line is (0, 0, 0)."
