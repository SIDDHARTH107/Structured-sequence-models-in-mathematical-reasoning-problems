    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose we have an image of size 256x256 pixels. If we apply the Fourier transform to the image, how many complex-valued Fourier coefficients will we obtain?",
    "message_2": "When we apply the Fourier transform to an image of size 256x256 pixels, we obtain the same number of complex-valued Fourier coefficients as there are pixels in the image. This is because the Fourier transform decomposes the image into its frequency components, and each pixel contributes to these components.\n\nSo, for a 256x256 image, there will be 256 x 256 = 65,536 complex-valued Fourier coefficients."
