    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the polynomial function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 8, we need to find the values of x for which f(x) = 0.\n\nWe can try factoring the polynomial or using synthetic division to find the zeros. In this case, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational zeros. The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational zero of a polynomial with integer coefficients can be written as p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term (8) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (1).\n\nThe factors of 8 are ±1, ±2, ±4, and ±8. Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational zeros are ±1, ±2, ±4, and ±8. We can test these values to see if any of them are zeros of the polynomial:\n\nf(1) = 1 - 5 + 6 - 8 = -6 (not a zero)\nf(-1) = -1 - 5 - 6 - 8 = -20 (not a zero)\nf(2) = 8 - 20 + 12 - 8 = -8 (not a zero)\nf(-2) = -8 - 20 - 12 - 8 = -48 (not a zero)\nf(4) = 64 - 80 + 24 - 8 = 0 (a zero)\nf(-4) = -64 - 80 - 24 - 8 = -176 (not a zero)\nf(8) = 512 - 320 + 48 - 8 = 232 (not a zero)\nf(-8) = -512 - 320 - 48 - 8 = -888 (not a zero)\n\nSo, we found one rational zero: x = 4. Now, we can use synthetic division to find the remaining zeros:\n\n4 | 1 -5  6 -8\n    |   4 -4  8\n    1 -1  2  0\n\nThe quotient is x^2 - x + 2. To find the remaining zeros, we need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 - x + 2 = 0. Since this equation does not factor easily, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (1 ± √(1 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(-7)) / 2\n\nThe remaining zeros are complex: x = (1 + √(-7))/2 and x = (1 - √(-7))/2.\n\nNow, let's graph the function on a coordinate plane. Since the zeros are x = 4, x = (1 + √(-7))/2, and x = (1 - √(-7))/2, we can plot the points (4, 0), ((1 + √(-7))/2, 0), and ((1 - √(-7))/2, 0) on the graph. The function is a cubic polynomial, so it will have a smooth curve with one local maximum and one local minimum. The graph will pass through the zeros and have the general shape of a cubic function.\n\nHere's a link to the graph of the function: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3mzqyqgqzr"
