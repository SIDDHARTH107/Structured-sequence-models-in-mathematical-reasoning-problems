    "message_1": "Consider a linear system with a transfer function given as H(s) = (s+3)/(s^2 + 4s + 13). Determine if the system is stable or unstable using Fourier analysis.",
    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using Fourier analysis, we first need to find the poles of the transfer function H(s). The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator of H(s) is given by:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 13\n\nTo find the poles, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 13 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(13))) / 2(1)\ns = (-4 ± √(-32)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\ns = -2 ± j√32\n\nNow, we need to analyze the real part of the poles. If the real part of all poles is negative, the system is stable. If the real part of any pole is positive, the system is unstable. If the real part of any pole is zero, the system is marginally stable.\n\nIn this case, the real part of both poles is -2, which is negative. Therefore, the system is stable according to Fourier analysis."
