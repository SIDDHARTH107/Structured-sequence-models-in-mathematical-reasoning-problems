    "message_2": "To minimize the surface area of a cylindrical can with a given volume, we will use calculus. Let the radius of the base of the cylinder be r centimeters and the height be h centimeters. The volume V and surface area A of the cylinder are given by the following formulas:\n\nV = πr^2h\nA = 2πrh + 2πr^2\n\nWe are given that the volume is 500 cubic centimeters, so we have:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of r:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow we will substitute this expression for h into the surface area formula:\n\nA(r) = 2πr(500 / (πr^2)) + 2πr^2\nA(r) = (1000 / r) + 2πr^2\n\nTo find the minimum surface area, we will find the critical points of A(r) by taking the derivative with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\nA'(r) = -1000 / r^2 + 4πr\n\nNow we set A'(r) = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = -1000 / r^2 + 4πr\n1000 / r^2 = 4πr\n1000 = 4πr^3\nr^3 = 1000 / (4π)\nr^3 = 250 / π\nr = (250 / π)^(1/3)\n\nNow we will find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\nh = 500 / (π(250 / π)^(2/3))\nh = 500 / (250^(2/3))\nh = 2(250^(1/3))\n\nSo, the dimensions of the can with minimum surface area are:\n\nr ≈ (250 / π)^(1/3) ≈ 3.02 cm\nh ≈ 2(250^(1/3)) ≈ 6.04 cm\n\nTo the nearest hundredth of a centimeter, the dimensions of the can with minimum surface area are approximately 3.02 cm for the radius and 6.04 cm for the height."
