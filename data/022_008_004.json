    "message_2": "An entire function is a function that is holomorphic (i.e., complex differentiable) at every point in the complex plane. We are given that $f(z) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$ for all $z \\neq 0$ and $f(0) = 0$. \n\nLet's consider the Taylor series expansion of $f(z)$ around $z = 0$. Since $f(z)$ is entire, it can be represented by its Taylor series:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$$\n\nwhere $a_n = \\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}$ are the coefficients of the Taylor series. We know that $f(0) = 0$, so $a_0 = 0$. Now let's find the Taylor series expansion of $f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$ around $z = 0$:\n\n$$f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n \\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^{-n}$$\n\nSince $f(z) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$, we have:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^{-n}$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of $z$ on both sides, we get:\n\n$$a_n = a_{-n} \\quad \\text{for all } n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\n\nHowever, this is only possible if $a_n = 0$ for all $n \\neq 0$. Therefore, the only entire function that satisfies the given conditions is the constant function $f(z) = 0$."
