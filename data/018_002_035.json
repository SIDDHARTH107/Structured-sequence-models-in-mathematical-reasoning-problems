    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of sets A and B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B, we first need to find the intersection of sets A and B.\n\nThe intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. So, let's find the common elements in sets A and B.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {4, 8, 12, 16}\n\nThe common elements in sets A and B are 4 and 8. Therefore, the intersection of sets A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∩ B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if all elements of set X are also elements of set Y, then set X is a subset of set Y.\n\nLet's check if A ∩ B is a subset of set A:\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nAll elements of A ∩ B (4 and 8) are also elements of set A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of set A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of set B:\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\nB = {4, 8, 12, 16}\n\nAll elements of A ∩ B (4 and 8) are also elements of set B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of set B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proven that the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B) is a subset of set A and a subset of set B."
