    "message_2": "Since f(z) is an entire function, it can be represented by its Taylor series expansion about z = 0:\n\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + ...\n\nwhere a_n are the coefficients of the Taylor series. We are given that |f(z)| ≤ 7|z|^3 for all z ∈ ℂ. Let's consider the function g(z) = f(z)/z^3. Then, we have:\n\ng(z) = a_0/z^3 + a_1/z^2 + a_2/z + a_3 + ...\n\nNow, we can see that |g(z)| ≤ 7 for all z ∈ ℂ. Since g(z) is also an entire function, we can apply the Cauchy's estimate for the derivatives of g(z). For any positive integer k and any circle |z| = R, we have:\n\n|g^(k)(0)| ≤ (k! * M) / R^k\n\nwhere M is the maximum value of |g(z)| on the circle |z| = R, and g^(k)(0) is the k-th derivative of g(z) evaluated at z = 0.\n\nSince |g(z)| ≤ 7 for all z ∈ ℂ, we can choose M = 7. Now, let's consider the limit as R goes to infinity:\n\nlim (R→∞) (k! * 7) / R^k = 0\n\nThis limit holds for all k ≥ 4. Therefore, the k-th derivative of g(z) at z = 0 is zero for all k ≥ 4. This implies that the Taylor series expansion of g(z) has only a finite number of non-zero terms, which means g(z) is a polynomial.\n\nNow, recall that g(z) = f(z)/z^3. Since g(z) is a polynomial, f(z) must also be a polynomial. Furthermore, since the k-th derivative of g(z) at z = 0 is zero for all k ≥ 4, the highest degree term in f(z) is z^3. Therefore, f(z) is a polynomial of degree 3."
