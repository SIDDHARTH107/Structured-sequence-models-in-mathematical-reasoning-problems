    "message_1": "A certain carnival game costs $5 to play. If you win, you get a prize worth $10. The probability of winning the game is 1/10. What is the expected value of playing this game?",
    "message_2": "The expected value of playing this game can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected Value (EV) = (Probability of Winning × Value of Winning) - (Probability of Losing × Cost of Playing)\n\nThe probability of winning is 1/10, and the value of winning is $10. The probability of losing is 9/10 (since there are only two outcomes: winning or losing), and the cost of playing is $5.\n\nEV = (1/10 × $10) - (9/10 × $5)\nEV = ($1) - ($4.50)\nEV = -$3.50\n\nThe expected value of playing this game is -$3.50, which means that on average, a player will lose $3.50 each time they play the game."
