    "message_1": "How many tetrahedrons are there in the fourth iteration of the Sierpinski tetrahedron construction process?\n\nHint: In each iteration, each face of the previous iteration's tetrahedrons is divided into four smaller equilateral triangles, and then the middle triangle is removed. In the first iteration, you begin with one large tetrahedron. In the second iteration, each face of the large tetrahedron is divided into four smaller tetrahedrons. In the third iteration, each face of the second iteration's tetrahedrons is divided into four even smaller tetrahedrons.",
    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski tetrahedron construction process, the number of tetrahedrons at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of Tetrahedrons = 4^(n-1)\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the fourth iteration, we can plug in n = 4 into the formula:\n\nNumber of Tetrahedrons = 4^(4-1) = 4^3 = 64\n\nSo, there are 64 tetrahedrons in the fourth iteration of the Sierpinski tetrahedron construction process."
