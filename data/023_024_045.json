    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x - 1 on the interval [-1, 1] with a period of 2, we first need to determine the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function (in this case, L = 1), and the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)] dx from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)] dx from -L to L\n\nLet's compute the coefficients a_n and b_n for f(x) = x - 1:\n\na_0 = (1/1) * ∫[(x - 1) * cos(0)] dx from -1 to 1\na_0 = ∫(x - 1) dx from -1 to 1\na_0 = [x^2/2 - x] from -1 to 1\na_0 = (1/2 - 1) - ((-1)^2/2 - (-1))\na_0 = -1/2\n\na_n = (1/1) * ∫[(x - 1) * cos(nπx)] dx from -1 to 1\na_n = ∫(x * cos(nπx) - cos(nπx)) dx from -1 to 1\na_n = [x/(nπ) * sin(nπx) + cos(nπx)/(n^2π^2)] from -1 to 1\na_n = (1/(nπ) * sin(nπ) + cos(nπ)/(n^2π^2)) - (-1/(nπ) * sin(-nπ) + cos(-nπ)/(n^2π^2))\na_n = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(nπ) = cos(-nπ))\n\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[(x - 1) * sin(nπx)] dx from -1 to 1\nb_n = ∫(x * sin(nπx) - sin(nπx)) dx from -1 to 1\nb_n = [-x/(nπ) * cos(nπx) - sin(nπx)/(n^2π^2)] from -1 to 1\nb_n = (-1/(nπ) * cos(nπ) - sin(nπ)/(n^2π^2)) - (1/(nπ) * cos(-nπ) - sin(-nπ)/(n^2π^2))\nb_n = 2/(nπ) * cos(nπ) (since sin(nπ) = sin(-nπ) = 0 and cos(-nπ) = cos(nπ))\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x - 1:\n\nf(x) = -1/4 + Σ(0 * cos(nπx) + (2/(nπ)) * cos(nπ) * sin(nπx))\nf(x) = -1/4 + Σ((2/(nπ)) * cos(nπ) * sin(nπx))\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x - 1 on the interval [-1, 1] with a period of 2."
