    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Let G be a group of order 49 = 7^2. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups of G, denoted by n_7, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2. n_7 divides 49\n\nThe only possibilities for n_7 are 1 and 49. However, since n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we must have n_7 = 1. Let P be the unique Sylow 7-subgroup of G. By the Sylow Theorems, P is normal in G. Since the order of P is 7, P is a cyclic group generated by some element a, i.e., P = ⟨a⟩.\n\nNow, let b be any element in G that is not in P. Since the order of G is 49, the order of the subgroup generated by b, denoted by ⟨b⟩, must be 1, 7, or 49. If the order of ⟨b⟩ is 1, then b is the identity element, which is a contradiction since the identity element is in P. If the order of ⟨b⟩ is 49, then G is cyclic, generated by b, and we are done.\n\nSo, we assume that the order of ⟨b⟩ is 7. Then, we have two cyclic subgroups of G: P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, both of order 7. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, their intersection must be trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, consider the set H = {ab : a ∈ P, b ∈ Q}. We claim that H is a subgroup of G. To show this, we need to verify the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: Let x = a_1b_1 and y = a_2b_2 be elements in H, where a_1, a_2 ∈ P and b_1, b_2 ∈ Q. Then, xy = a_1b_1a_2b_2. Since P is normal in G, we have b_1a_2 = a_3b_3 for some a_3 ∈ P and b_3 ∈ Q. Thus, xy = a_1a_3b_3b_2, which is an element in H since a_1a_3 ∈ P and b_3b_2 ∈ Q.\n\n2. Identity: Since e ∈ P and e ∈ Q, we have ee ∈ H, which means that the identity element is in H.\n\n3. Inverses: Let x = ab be an element in H, where a ∈ P and b ∈ Q. Since P and Q are cyclic groups, a^(-1) ∈ P and b^(-1) ∈ Q. Now, consider the element x^(-1) = (ab)^(-1) = b^(-1)a^(-1). Since P is normal in G, we have b^(-1)a^(-1) = a_1b_1 for some a_1 ∈ P and b_1 ∈ Q. Thus, x^(-1) = a_1b_1 ∈ H.\n\nSince H satisfies all the properties of a subgroup, H is a subgroup of G. Moreover, the order of H is |P||Q| = 7 * 7 = 49, which means H = G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7."
