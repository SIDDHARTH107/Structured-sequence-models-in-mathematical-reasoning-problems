    "message_1": "Suppose a university claims that the average GPA of its students is 3.2. A sample of 50 students was taken and the average GPA of the sample was found to be 3.5 with a standard deviation of 0.6. Is there significant evidence to support the university's claim at a 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is significant evidence to support the university's claim at a 5% significance level, we will conduct a hypothesis test using a one-sample t-test.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 3.2 (The average GPA of the university's students is 3.2)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 3.2 (The average GPA of the university's students is not 3.2)\n\nStep 2: Determine the test statistic.\nSince we are given the sample mean (x̄ = 3.5), sample standard deviation (s = 0.6), and sample size (n = 50), we can calculate the t-score using the following formula:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (3.5 - 3.2) / (0.6 / √50)\nt ≈ 3.54\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value.\nFor a two-tailed test with a 5% significance level (α = 0.05), we need to find the critical t-value that corresponds to the 2.5% in each tail. With 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49), we can use a t-distribution table or calculator to find the critical t-value.\n\nt_critical ≈ ± 2.01\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value.\nSince the calculated t-score (3.54) is greater than the critical t-value (2.01), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is significant evidence at the 5% significance level to reject the university's claim that the average GPA of its students is 3.2."
