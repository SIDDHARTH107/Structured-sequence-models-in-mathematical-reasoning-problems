    "message_1": "In a group of 5 volunteers, each person has the option to either donate $10 towards a charity or keep the money for themselves. If at least 3 people decide to donate, the entire group will receive a bonus of $50. However, if only 1 or 2 people donate, there is no bonus. What would be the optimal strategy for each individual volunteer in order to maximize their own outcome? What is the group's overall outcome?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their own outcome, each volunteer should consider the possible scenarios and their outcomes. Let's analyze the possible outcomes for an individual volunteer:\n\n1. If the volunteer donates and at least 2 other people donate, they will have $10 (from the $50 bonus) - $10 (donation) = $0, but they will have contributed to the charity.\n2. If the volunteer donates and less than 2 other people donate, they will have -$10 (donation) and no bonus.\n3. If the volunteer doesn't donate and at least 3 other people donate, they will have $10 (from the $50 bonus) + $10 (kept money) = $20.\n4. If the volunteer doesn't donate and less than 3 other people donate, they will have $10 (kept money) and no bonus.\n\nThe optimal strategy for each individual volunteer to maximize their own outcome would be to not donate and hope that at least 3 other people donate. However, if all volunteers follow this strategy, no one will donate, and no bonus will be received.\n\nA better approach would be for the group to coordinate and agree that 3 volunteers will donate, while the other 2 will not. This way, the 3 donating volunteers will have a net outcome of $0, the 2 non-donating volunteers will have a net outcome of $20 each, and the charity will receive $30. The group's overall outcome would be $40 ($20 + $20) and a $30 donation to the charity."
