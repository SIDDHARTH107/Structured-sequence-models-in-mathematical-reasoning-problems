The percentage of defective products for each type are as follows: \n\n- Product A: 5%\n- Product B: 10%\n- Product C: 15%\n\nEach day, the factory produces 1000 products, with the production of each type distributed as follows:\n\n- Product A: 400 units\n- Product B: 300 units\n- Product C: 300 units\n\nAssuming that the production of each product is independent of the others, what is the probability that at least 50 defective products will be produced on a given day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of having x defective products, n is the total number of products, x is the number of defective products, p is the probability of a product being defective, and C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time.\n\nFirst, let's find the expected number of defective products for each type:\n\n- Product A: 400 units * 5% = 20 defective products\n- Product B: 300 units * 10% = 30 defective products\n- Product C: 300 units * 15% = 45 defective products\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of having at least 50 defective products in total. To do this, we can find the probability of having less than 50 defective products and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of having 49 or fewer defective products:\n\nP(0 to 49) = Σ P(x) for x = 0 to 49\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the binomial probability formula for each product type and then multiply the probabilities together:\n\nP_A(x) = C(400, x) * (0.05)^x * (0.95)^(400-x)\nP_B(y) = C(300, y) * (0.1)^y * (0.9)^(300-y)\nP_C(z) = C(300, z) * (0.15)^z * (0.85)^(300-z)\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for all possible combinations of x, y, and z such that x + y + z ≤ 49. This can be done using a triple nested loop or a more efficient algorithm. However, this calculation can be quite complex and time-consuming.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the total number of defective products can be calculated as follows:\n\nμ = μ_A + μ_B + μ_C = 20 + 30 + 45 = 95\nσ = sqrt(σ_A^2 + σ_B^2 + σ_C^2) = sqrt((400 * 0.05 * 0.95) + (300 * 0.1 * 0.9) + (300 * 0.15 * 0.85)) ≈ 7.07\n\nNow, we can use the normal distribution to approximate the probability of having at least 50 defective products:\n\nP(x ≥ 50) = 1 - P(x ≤ 49)\n\nTo find P(x ≤ 49), we can use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ = (49 - 95) / 7.07 ≈ -6.51\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that P(z ≤ -6.51) is very close to 0. Therefore, the probability of having at least 50 defective products is approximately:\n\nP(x ≥ 50) = 1 - P(x ≤ 49) ≈ 1 - 0 ≈ 1\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 50 defective products on a given day is approximately 1, or almost certain."
