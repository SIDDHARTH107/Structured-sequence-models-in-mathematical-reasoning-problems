    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2x-5)/3 + 1/2x = 7/6, we will first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6x. Then, we will rewrite the equation with the fractions having the same denominator:\n\n[(2x-5)(2x) + 1(3)]/6x = 7/6\n\nNow, we will multiply both sides of the equation by 6x to eliminate the denominators:\n\n(2x-5)(2x) + 1(3) = 7x\n\nNext, we will distribute the terms and simplify the equation:\n\n4x^2 - 10x + 3 = 7x\n\nNow, we will move all the terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\n4x^2 - 17x + 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = -17, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = [17 ± sqrt((-17)^2 - 4(4)(3))] / (2*4)\n\nx = [17 ± sqrt(289 - 48)] / 8\n\nx = [17 ± sqrt(241)] / 8\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (17 + sqrt(241)) / 8 and x = (17 - sqrt(241)) / 8"
