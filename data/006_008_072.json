    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on any given day (0.3 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (5 days in this case)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we're interested in\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 2 rainy days, so we need to find the probabilities for 2, 3, 4, and 5 rainy days and add them together.\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\n\nLet's calculate each probability using the binomial formula:\n\n1. P(X = 2):\nC(5, 2) = 10\nP(X = 2) = 10 * (0.3)^2 * (1-0.3)^(5-2) = 10 * 0.09 * 0.7^3 = 10 * 0.09 * 0.343 = 0.3087\n\n2. P(X = 3):\nC(5, 3) = 10\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.3)^3 * (1-0.3)^(5-3) = 10 * 0.027 * 0.7^2 = 10 * 0.027 * 0.49 = 0.1323\n\n3. P(X = 4):\nC(5, 4) = 5\nP(X = 4) = 5 * (0.3)^4 * (1-0.3)^(5-4) = 5 * 0.0081 * 0.7 = 0.02835\n\n4. P(X = 5):\nC(5, 5) = 1\nP(X = 5) = 1 * (0.3)^5 * (1-0.3)^(5-5) = 1 * 0.00243 * 1 = 0.00243\n\nNow, let's add these probabilities together:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 0.3087 + 0.1323 + 0.02835 + 0.00243 = 0.47175\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on at least 2 out of the next 5 days in that city is approximately 0.47175 or 47.175%."
