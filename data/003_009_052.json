    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the length of the third side, BC. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and an angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, let side AB be a, side AC be b, and side BC be c. We are given that a = 8 cm, b = 10 cm, and angle C = 60 degrees. We can now plug these values into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nc² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(60)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 60 degrees. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the cosine of 60 degrees is equal to 1/2. So, cos(60) = 1/2.\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\nc² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * (1/2)\n\nc² = 64 + 100 - 80\n\nc² = 164 - 80\n\nc² = 84\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √84 ≈ 9.165\n\nNow that we have the length of side BC, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = AB + AC + BC\n\nPerimeter = 8 + 10 + 9.165 ≈ 27.165 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 27.165 cm."
