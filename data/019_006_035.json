    "message_1": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a precise numerical problem for Deontic Logic since it is a branch of logic concerned with obligations, permissions, and related concepts, and does not involve numerical calculations. However, here is a sample question related to Deontic Logic: \n\nGiven the sentence \"It is morally permissible to tell a lie in order to save a life\", identify whether it is a deontically permissible or impermissible action according to the deontic logic system.",
    "message_2": "In the given sentence, \"It is morally permissible to tell a lie in order to save a life,\" the action of telling a lie to save a life is considered morally permissible. According to the deontic logic system, this action would be classified as deontically permissible, as it is allowed within the moral framework presented."
