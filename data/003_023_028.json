    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(4^2 + (-2)^2 + 3^2) = √(16 + 4 + 9) = √29\n|B| = √(6^2 + 8^2 + (-5)^2) = √(36 + 64 + 25) = √125\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between the two vectors using the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\n4 * 6 + (-2) * 8 + 3 * (-5) = 24 - 16 - 15 = -7\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\ncos(θ) = -7 / (√29 * √125)\n\nNow, we can find sin(θ) using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - cos^2(θ)\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (-7 / (√29 * √125))^2)\n\nNow, let's find the unit vector n perpendicular to both A and B. We can use the cross product formula for this:\n\nn = (A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y, A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z, A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x) / |A x B|\n\nn = ((-2) * (-5) - 3 * 8, 3 * 6 - 4 * (-5), 4 * 8 - (-2) * 6) / |A x B|\n\nn = (10 - 24, 18 + 20, 32 + 12) / |A x B|\nn = (-14, 38, 44) / |A x B|\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n\nA x B = (√29 * √125) * √(1 - (-7 / (√29 * √125))^2) * (-14, 38, 44)\n\nA x B = (|A| |B| sin(θ)) * (-14, 38, 44)\n\nSince the cross product is a vector, we can't simplify it further without knowing the exact value of sin(θ). However, the cross product A x B is proportional to the vector (-14, 38, 44) with the magnitude |A| |B| sin(θ)."
