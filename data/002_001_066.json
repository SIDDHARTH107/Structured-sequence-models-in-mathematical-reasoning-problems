    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 9 cm and the height is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (9 * 12) / 2\nArea = 108 / 2\nArea = 54 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 54 square centimeters."
