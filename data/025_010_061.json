    "message_2": "The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a curve C of genus g and a line bundle L on C, we have:\n\nh^0(C, L) - h^0(C, K_C - L) = deg(L) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere h^0(C, L) is the dimension of the space H^0(C, L), K_C is the canonical bundle on C, and deg(L) is the degree of the line bundle L.\n\nIn our case, we have a curve C of genus g = 3 and a line bundle L with deg(L) = 4. We want to calculate h^0(C, L).\n\nFirst, we need to find the degree of the canonical bundle K_C. For a curve of genus g, we have deg(K_C) = 2g - 2. So in our case, deg(K_C) = 2(3) - 2 = 4.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh^0(C, L) - h^0(C, K_C - L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\nh^0(C, L) - h^0(C, 4 - 4) = 4 + 1 - 3\nh^0(C, L) - h^0(C, 0) = 2\n\nSince K_C - L is a trivial bundle (degree 0), we have h^0(C, K_C - L) = h^0(C, 0) = 1. This is because the space of global sections of the trivial bundle is just the constant functions.\n\nNow we can solve for h^0(C, L):\n\nh^0(C, L) - 1 = 2\nh^0(C, L) = 3\n\nSo the dimension of the space H^0(C, L) is 3."
