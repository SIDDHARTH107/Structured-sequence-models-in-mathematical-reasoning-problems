    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. First, let's analyze the graph properties.\n\nA connected undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges is guaranteed to be connected, as the minimum number of edges required to connect 10 vertices is 10 - 1 = 9 edges (forming a tree). Since we have 15 edges, the graph is more connected than a tree.\n\nNow, let's consider the best-case scenario for the diameter, which is when the graph is a complete graph (every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the diameter would be 1, as every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex. However, a complete graph with 10 vertices would have C(10, 2) = 45 edges, which is more than the 15 edges we have.\n\nSo, the diameter must be greater than 1. Let's consider the next best-case scenario, which is when the graph is almost complete, but with some missing edges. In this case, the diameter would be 2, as every vertex would be connected to every other vertex through at most one intermediate vertex.\n\nTo achieve a diameter of 2, we need to ensure that for every pair of vertices (u, v), there exists a vertex w such that both (u, w) and (w, v) are edges in the graph. In other words, we need to ensure that every vertex has a degree of at least n/2, where n is the number of vertices (10 in this case).\n\nLet's check if it's possible to have a graph with 10 vertices, 15 edges, and every vertex having a degree of at least 5:\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. So, if every vertex has a degree of at least 5, the sum of the degrees would be at least 5 * 10 = 50. However, the sum of the degrees in our graph is 2 * 15 = 30, which is less than 50.\n\nThus, it's not possible to have a graph with 10 vertices, 15 edges, and every vertex having a degree of at least 5. Therefore, the diameter of the graph G must be greater than 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the next possible diameter value, which is 3. We can construct a graph with 10 vertices, 15 edges, and a diameter of 3 as follows:\n\n1. Create a central vertex (A) connected to 6 other vertices (B, C, D, E, F, G).\n2. Connect each of the 6 vertices (B, C, D, E, F, G) to a unique vertex (B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1), forming 6 \"spokes\" around the central vertex (A).\n\nThis graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges, and the longest shortest path between any two vertices is 3 (e.g., from B1 to G1, the shortest path is B1 -> B -> A -> G -> G1). Therefore, the diameter of the graph G is 3."
