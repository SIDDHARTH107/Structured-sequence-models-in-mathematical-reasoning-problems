    "message_2": "First, we need to find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 12x + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d(6x^2 - 12x + 4)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 12x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of f(x) at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 12(2) - 12\n\nf''(2) = 24 - 12\n\nf''(2) = 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) at x = 2 is 12."
