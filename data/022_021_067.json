    "message_2": "To evaluate the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 5e^(2t)sin(3t), we will use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st)f(t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nIn this case, f(t) = 5e^(2t)sin(3t). So, we have:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * 5e^(2t)sin(3t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we can combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(s) = 5∫(e^((2-s)t)sin(3t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let:\n\nu = e^((2-s)t)\ndv = sin(3t)dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = (2-s)e^((2-s)t)dt\nv = -1/3 cos(3t)\n\nNow, applying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = 5[-1/3 e^((2-s)t)cos(3t) | from 0 to infinity] - 5∫(-1/3 cos(3t)(2-s)e^((2-s)t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nThe first term in the brackets will be zero when evaluated from 0 to infinity (assuming s > 2 for convergence). So, we are left with:\n\nF(s) = (5/3)∫((2-s)e^((2-s)t)cos(3t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we need to apply integration by parts again. Let:\n\nu = e^((2-s)t)\ndv = cos(3t)dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = (2-s)e^((2-s)t)dt\nv = 1/3 sin(3t)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = (5/3)[1/3 e^((2-s)t)sin(3t) | from 0 to infinity] - (5/3)∫(1/3 sin(3t)(2-s)e^((2-s)t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nThe first term in the brackets will be zero when evaluated from 0 to infinity (assuming s > 2 for convergence). So, we are left with:\n\nF(s) = (5/9)∫((2-s)e^((2-s)t)sin(3t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we have the original integral again, but with a factor of 5/9:\n\nF(s) = (5/9)F(s)\n\nThus, we can solve for F(s):\n\nF(s) = 5/(9-5) * ∫(e^((2-s)t)sin(3t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nF(s) = 5/4 * ∫(e^((2-s)t)sin(3t)dt) from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we can use the Laplace transform formula for the product of an exponential and a sine function:\n\nL{e^(at)sin(bt)} = b/((s-a)^2 + b^2)\n\nIn our case, a = 2 and b = 3:\n\nF(s) = 5/4 * (3/((s-2)^2 + 3^2))\n\nF(s) = 15/(((s-2)^2) + 9)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 5e^(2t)sin(3t) is:\n\nF(s) = 15/((s-2)^2 + 9)"
