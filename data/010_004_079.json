    "message_2": "Yes, the set A = {1/n : n ∈ ℕ} has a limit point in ℝ. The limit point is 0.\n\nProof:\n\nA limit point x of a set A is a point such that for any ε > 0, there exists an element a ∈ A with 0 < |a - x| < ε. In other words, there are elements of A arbitrarily close to x.\n\nLet ε > 0 be given. We need to show that there exists an element a ∈ A such that 0 < |a - 0| < ε, which simplifies to 0 < a < ε.\n\nSince 1/n ∈ A for all n ∈ ℕ, we can choose an integer N such that 1/N < ε. This is possible due to the Archimedean property of the real numbers, which states that for any real number x, there exists a natural number n such that n > x.\n\nNow, let a = 1/N. Then a ∈ A, and 0 < a < ε, as required. Therefore, 0 is a limit point of the set A."
