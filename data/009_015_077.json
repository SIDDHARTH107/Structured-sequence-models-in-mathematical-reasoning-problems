    "message_1": "A particular radioactive substance decays at a rate of 0.05 per day. If the initial dosage was 500 milligrams, what will be the mass of the substance after 30 days, assuming the half-life is 10 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 500 milligrams, the time elapsed is 30 days, and the half-life is 10 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^(30/10)\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^3\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/8)\nFinal mass = 62.5 milligrams\n\nSo after 30 days, the mass of the radioactive substance will be 62.5 milligrams."
