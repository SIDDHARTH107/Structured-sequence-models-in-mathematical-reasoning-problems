    "message_1": "A game is played on a 5x5 grid of squares. Two players take turns marking a square on the grid with their respective symbol (X or O). The game is won by the player who places three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. If all squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw. \n\nWhat is the total number of possible game outcomes for this scenario without any wins or losses after all squares have been filled?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of possible game outcomes without any wins or losses after all squares have been filled, we need to consider the number of ways to place X's and O's on the grid such that no three of them are in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nLet's start by counting the number of ways to place X's and O's on the grid without any horizontal or vertical wins. We can divide the 5x5 grid into five horizontal strips, each containing a row of 5 squares. In each strip, there must be at least one X and one O, so there are no horizontal wins. There are 5 ways to choose the position of the X in the first strip, 4 ways in the second strip, 3 ways in the third strip, 2 ways in the fourth strip, and 1 way in the fifth strip. This gives us a total of 5! = 120 ways to place X's and O's in the strips without any horizontal wins.\n\nNow, we need to consider the diagonal wins. There are two main diagonals, each containing 5 squares. If there is a diagonal win, there must be at least three X's or three O's in one of the main diagonals. We can count the number of ways to place X's and O's on the grid such that there is a diagonal win and subtract this from the total number of ways without any horizontal or vertical wins.\n\nThere are 5 ways to choose the position of the third X in the main diagonal, and for each of these choices, there are 4 ways to choose the position of the third O in the other main diagonal. This gives us a total of 5 x 4 = 20 ways to place X's and O's on the grid such that there is a diagonal win.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible game outcomes without any wins or losses after all squares have been filled is 120 - 20 = 100."
