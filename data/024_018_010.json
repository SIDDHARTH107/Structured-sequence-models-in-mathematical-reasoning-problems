    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1, 0, 1) in the direction of the unit vector (1, 1, 0), we first need to find the tangent plane to the surface at the given point.\n\nThe surface is given by the equation z = x^2 + y^2 / 4. We can find the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = y/2\n\nAt the point (1, 0, 1), the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2\n∂z/∂y = 0\n\nThe normal vector to the tangent plane is given by the gradient of the surface at the point (1, 0, 1):\n\nN = (2, 0, -1)\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vector in the direction of the unit vector (1, 1, 0). We can project the unit vector onto the tangent plane:\n\nT = (1, 1, 0) - ((1, 1, 0) • N) * N\nT = (1, 1, 0) - (2) * (2, 0, -1)\nT = (1, 1, 0) - (4, 0, -2)\nT = (-3, 1, 2)\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form of the surface. We need to find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = 1/2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nThe second fundamental form matrix is:\n\n| 2   0 |\n| 0  1/2 |\n\nNow, we can find the sectional curvature K in the direction of the tangent vector T:\n\nK = (T • (second fundamental form) • T) / (T • T)^2\nK = ((-3, 1, 2) • | 2   0 | • (-3, 1, 2)) / ((-3, 1, 2) • (-3, 1, 2))^2\n      | 0  1/2 |\n\nK = (18 + 1/2) / (9 + 1 + 4)^2\nK = (37/2) / 196\nK = 37/392\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1, 0, 1) in the direction of the unit vector (1, 1, 0) is 37/392."
