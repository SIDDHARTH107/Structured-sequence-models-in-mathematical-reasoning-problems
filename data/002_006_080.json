    "message_1": "A circular race track has a radius of 120 meters. What is the circumference of the race track?",
    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the circular race track is 120 meters. So, we can find the circumference by plugging the radius into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(120)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 120\nC ≈ 753.98 meters\n\nThe circumference of the race track is approximately 753.98 meters."
