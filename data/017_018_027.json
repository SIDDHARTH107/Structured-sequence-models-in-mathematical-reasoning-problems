    "message_2": "To find the possible number of subgroups of order 2 in a group of order 32, we can use the fact that a subgroup of order 2 must be generated by an element of order 2. In other words, we are looking for the number of elements of order 2 in the group.\n\nLet G be a group of order 32. Since 32 = 2^5, by Sylow's Theorem, there must be a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 in G. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. By the structure of p-groups, the center Z(P) of P is non-trivial. Thus, Z(P) has order 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32.\n\n1. If |Z(P)| = 2, then there is exactly one element of order 2 in Z(P), and hence in G.\n2. If |Z(P)| = 4, then there are three elements of order 2 in Z(P), and hence in G.\n3. If |Z(P)| = 8, then there are seven elements of order 2 in Z(P), and hence in G.\n4. If |Z(P)| = 16, then there are fifteen elements of order 2 in Z(P), and hence in G.\n5. If |Z(P)| = 32, then G is abelian, and every non-identity element has order 2, so there are 31 elements of order 2 in G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group C32: There is only one element of order 2 in C32, so it corresponds to case 1.\n\n2. Dihedral group D16: There are 8 elements of order 2 in D16 (the reflections), so it corresponds to case 3.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 32: There are six non-abelian groups of order 32, and they have different numbers of subgroups of order 2. However, since they are non-abelian, their center cannot have order 32, so they cannot correspond to case 5.\n\nIn conclusion, if the given group has 1, 3, 7, 15, or 31 subgroups of order 2, it can be isomorphic to C32, D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32, respectively."
