Calculate the order $|E(\\mathbb{F}_5)|$ of the group of points of $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\"\n\nTo solve this problem, the student would need to determine all the points that satisfy the equation of the elliptic curve over the field $\\mathbb{F}_5$ and count them. The order of a group is the number of elements in that group, so the answer to the question would be a numerical value.",
    "message_2": "To find the order of the group of points of the elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_5$, we need to find all the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 4$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_5$. In this field, the elements are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nWe can start by iterating through all possible values of $x$ and $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ and checking if they satisfy the equation:\n\nFor $x = 0$:\n$y^2 = 0^3 - 4(0) + 4 = 4$\nThe possible values of $y$ that satisfy this equation are $y = 2$ and $y = 3$.\n\nFor $x = 1$:\n$y^2 = 1^3 - 4(1) + 4 = 1$\nThe possible values of $y$ that satisfy this equation are $y = 1$ and $y = 4$.\n\nFor $x = 2$:\n$y^2 = 2^3 - 4(2) + 4 = 3$\nThere are no values of $y$ that satisfy this equation.\n\nFor $x = 3$:\n$y^2 = 3^3 - 4(3) + 4 = 1$\nThe possible values of $y$ that satisfy this equation are $y = 1$ and $y = 4$.\n\nFor $x = 4$:\n$y^2 = 4^3 - 4(4) + 4 = 0$\nThe only value of $y$ that satisfies this equation is $y = 0$.\n\nSo, the points on the elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_5$ are:\n$(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0)$\n\nAdditionally, we need to include the point at infinity, denoted as $\\mathcal{O}$, which is the identity element in the group of points of the elliptic curve.\n\nTherefore, the order $|E(\\mathbb{F}_5)|$ of the group of points of $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_5$ is 8, as there are 8 elements in the group."
