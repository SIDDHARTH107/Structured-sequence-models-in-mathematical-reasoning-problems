The elements in the sets have different structures. In (A × B) × {6}, the elements are ordered pairs with the first element being an ordered pair from A × B and the second element being 6. In A × (B × {6}), the elements are ordered pairs with the first element being an element from A and the second element being an ordered pair from B × {6}.\n\nTherefore, (A × B) × {6} ≠ A × (B × {6})."
