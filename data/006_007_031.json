    "message_1": "What is the probability that a particular stock price will increase by at least $2 in the next trading day, given that the historical standard deviation of its daily price changes is $4 and the average daily price change is $1?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Z-score formula to find the probability. The Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean. In this case, the observation is a $2 increase in stock price, the mean is a $1 average daily price change, and the standard deviation is $4.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere:\nZ = Z-score\nX = observation (in this case, a $2 increase)\nμ = mean (in this case, a $1 average daily price change)\nσ = standard deviation (in this case, $4)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nZ = (2 - 1) / 4\nZ = 1 / 4\nZ = 0.25\n\nNow that we have the Z-score, we can use a Z-table (also known as a standard normal table) to find the probability that the stock price will increase by at least $2. A Z-table provides the probability that a random variable from a standard normal distribution (with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1) will be less than or equal to a given Z-score.\n\nLooking up a Z-score of 0.25 in a Z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.5987. However, this is the probability that the stock price will be less than or equal to a $2 increase. Since we want the probability of at least a $2 increase, we need to find the complement of this probability.\n\nThe complement of a probability is given by:\n\nP(at least $2 increase) = 1 - P(less than or equal to $2 increase)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(at least $2 increase) = 1 - 0.5987\nP(at least $2 increase) ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will increase by at least $2 in the next trading day is approximately 40.13%."
