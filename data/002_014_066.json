    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm and a height of 4 cm. Find its surface area.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nl = 5 cm\nw = 3 cm\nh = 4 cm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSA = 2(5)(3) + 2(5)(4) + 2(3)(4)\nSA = 30 + 40 + 24\nSA = 94 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the surface area of the rectangular prism is 94 square centimeters."
