    "message_2": "To find the possible orders of the subgroups generated by a^4, we need to determine the order of the element a^4 in the cyclic group G of order 20.\n\nRecall that the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer k such that (a^4)^k = e, where e is the identity element in the group.\n\nSince G is a cyclic group of order 20, we know that a^20 = e. Now, we want to find the smallest positive integer k such that (a^4)^k = a^(4k) = e.\n\nUsing the fact that a^20 = e, we can write a^(4k) = (a^20)^m for some integer m. Thus, 4k = 20m, or k = 5m. The smallest positive integer k that satisfies this equation is when m = 1, so k = 5.\n\nTherefore, the order of the element a^4 in the cyclic group G is 5. The subgroup generated by a^4 will also be cyclic, and its order will be equal to the order of the element a^4, which is 5.\n\nSo, the possible order of the subgroups generated by a^4 is 5."
