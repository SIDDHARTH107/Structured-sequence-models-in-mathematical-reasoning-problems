    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a manifold with coordinate chart $\\{(U_i, \\phi_i)\\}_{i\\in I}$, where $U_i$ is an open subset of $M$ and $\\phi_i$ is a coordinate map. Let $f: M\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function and $X$ be a smooth vector field on $M$. Consider the tensor field $T$ on $M$ defined as $T = fX\\otimes X$. Find the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the standard Levi-Civita connection on $M$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T = fX \\otimes X$, we will use the Leibniz rule for tensor products. Let $\\nabla$ be the Levi-Civita connection on $M$. Then for any smooth vector field $Y$ on $M$, we have:\n\n$\\nabla_Y T = \\nabla_Y (fX \\otimes X) = (\\nabla_Y f) X \\otimes X + f (\\nabla_Y X) \\otimes X + fX \\otimes (\\nabla_Y X)$.\n\nNow, we will compute each term separately:\n\n1. $(\\nabla_Y f) X \\otimes X$: Since $f$ is a smooth function, we have $\\nabla_Y f = Y(f)$, which is the directional derivative of $f$ along $Y$. Therefore, $(\\nabla_Y f) X \\otimes X = Y(f) X \\otimes X$.\n\n2. $f (\\nabla_Y X) \\otimes X$: This term is straightforward, as we just apply the connection $\\nabla$ to the vector field $X$ along $Y$ and then multiply by the function $f$.\n\n3. $fX \\otimes (\\nabla_Y X)$: Similar to the second term, we apply the connection $\\nabla$ to the vector field $X$ along $Y$ and then take the tensor product with the vector field $fX$.\n\nPutting all the terms together, we get:\n\n$\\nabla_Y T = Y(f) X \\otimes X + f (\\nabla_Y X) \\otimes X + fX \\otimes (\\nabla_Y X)$.\n\nThis is the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T = fX \\otimes X$ with respect to the standard Levi-Civita connection on $M$."
