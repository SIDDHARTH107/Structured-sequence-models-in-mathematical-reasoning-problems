    "message_2": "To find the maximum area of a rectangle with a given perimeter, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and the formula for the area of a rectangle.\n\nPerimeter (P) = 2(Length (L) + Width (W))\nArea (A) = Length (L) * Width (W)\n\nWe are given the perimeter as 100 units, so:\n\n100 = 2(L + W)\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that give the maximum area. To do this, we can use calculus or simply recognize that a rectangle with the maximum area for a given perimeter is a square. This is because, for a fixed perimeter, the area is maximized when the length and width are equal.\n\nSo, we can set L = W and solve for L and W:\n\n100 = 2(L + L)\n100 = 4L\nL = 25\n\nSince L = W, the width is also 25 units.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the rectangle that give the maximum area are 25 units by 25 units."
