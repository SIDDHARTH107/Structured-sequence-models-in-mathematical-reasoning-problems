    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 40, which can be factored as 2^3 * 5. Therefore, we will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and the Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which we will call P_5, and it is normal in G since it is unique.\n\nNow let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which we will call P_2, and it is normal in G.\n\nIf both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G, then their product P_2P_5 is also normal in G. Since their intersection is trivial (only the identity element), the order of P_2P_5 is |P_2| * |P_5| = 8 * 5 = 40, which is the order of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which are both cyclic groups of orders 8 and 5, respectively. This means that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40.\n\nIf n_2 = 5, then there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, and they are not necessarily normal in G. In this case, we can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups of order 40. However, there are only five such non-abelian groups, not eight as stated in the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C40, the dihedral group D20 (which is one of the non-abelian groups of order 40), or one of the other four non-abelian groups of order 40. The problem statement is incorrect in saying that there are eight non-abelian groups of order 40."
