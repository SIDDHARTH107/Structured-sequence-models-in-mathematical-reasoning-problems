    "message_1": "A manufacturer of tennis balls claims that the average bounce of its tennis balls is 100 cm. A sample of 36 tennis balls is tested and the average bounce is found to be 97 cm with a standard deviation of 5.5 cm. Using central limit theorem, what is the probability that the true mean bounce is between 98.5 cm and 101.5 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the true mean bounce is between 98.5 cm and 101.5 cm, we will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). According to the CLT, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 100 cm, the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown, the sample mean (x̄) is 97 cm, the sample standard deviation (s) is 5.5 cm, and the sample size (n) is 36.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Since we don't know the population standard deviation (σ), we will use the sample standard deviation (s) as an estimate.\n\nSE = s / √n\nSE = 5.5 / √36\nSE = 5.5 / 6\nSE ≈ 0.917\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the interval (98.5 cm and 101.5 cm) using the following formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower bound (98.5 cm):\n\nz_lower = (98.5 - 100) / 0.917\nz_lower ≈ -1.64\n\nFor the upper bound (101.5 cm):\n\nz_upper = (101.5 - 100) / 0.917\nz_upper ≈ 1.64\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The probability for z = -1.64 is approximately 0.0505, and the probability for z = 1.64 is approximately 0.9495.\n\nTo find the probability that the true mean bounce is between 98.5 cm and 101.5 cm, we need to find the area between these two z-scores:\n\nP(-1.64 < z < 1.64) = P(z < 1.64) - P(z < -1.64)\nP(-1.64 < z < 1.64) = 0.9495 - 0.0505\nP(-1.64 < z < 1.64) ≈ 0.899\n\nTherefore, there is approximately an 89.9% probability that the true mean bounce is between 98.5 cm and 101.5 cm."
