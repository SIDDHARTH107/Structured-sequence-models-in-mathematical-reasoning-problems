    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at x = 4, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 4.\n\nThe function is f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1.\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2)/dx - d(3x)/dx + d(1)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 2 * 2x^(2-1) - 3 * 1x^(1-1)\n\nf'(x) = 4x - 3\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 4(4) - 3\n\nf'(4) = 16 - 3\n\nf'(4) = 13\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at x = 4 is 13."
