    "message_2": "To find the poles of the function f(z) = (z - 1) / (z^2 - 3z + 2), we first need to find the zeros of the denominator, since poles occur when the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic function: z^2 - 3z + 2. We can factor this quadratic function as follows:\n\nz^2 - 3z + 2 = (z - 1)(z - 2)\n\nNow, we can see that the zeros of the denominator are z = 1 and z = 2. These are the points where the function f(z) will have poles.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether these poles are simple or of higher order. A pole is simple if the multiplicity of the zero in the denominator is 1, and it is of higher order if the multiplicity is greater than 1.\n\nIn this case, both zeros (z = 1 and z = 2) have a multiplicity of 1, as they each appear once in the factored form of the denominator. Therefore, both poles are simple poles.\n\nSo, the function f(z) has two simple poles at z = 1 and z = 2."
