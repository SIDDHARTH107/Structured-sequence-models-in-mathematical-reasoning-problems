    "message_2": "To find the number of intersection points between the two curves using Bezout's theorem, we first need to determine the degrees of the two curves.\n\nThe first curve is defined by the equation x^3 + y^2 = 4. The highest power of x or y in this equation is 3 (from the x^3 term), so the degree of the first curve is 3.\n\nThe second curve is defined by the equation 2x^2 + 3y^2 = 12. The highest power of x or y in this equation is 2 (from both the 2x^2 and 3y^2 terms), so the degree of the second curve is 2.\n\nNow, we can apply Bezout's theorem, which states that the number of intersection points between two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the curves intersect at a finite number of points and have no common components.\n\nIn this case, the product of the degrees is 3 * 2 = 6. Therefore, according to Bezout's theorem, the two curves have 6 intersection points. However, this number may be reduced if some of the intersection points are complex or if the curves have common components."
