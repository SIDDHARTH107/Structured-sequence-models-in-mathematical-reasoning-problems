They want to maximize the total observation time subject to the following constraints:\n\n- The total time allocated to A and B should be at least 120 hours.\n- The total time allocated to B and C should be at least 160 hours.\n- The total time allocated to A, B and C should be at least 220 hours.\n\nThe observation times of each celestial body are modeled as a vector: t = [tA, tB, tC], in hours. The time spent to observe A and B is modeled as a semi-definite matrix:\n\nM = [mA+tA,   mB,\n     mB,      mB+tB],\n\nwhere mB = 20 and mA = 50. The time spent to observe B and C is modeled by a semi-definite matrix:\n\nN = [mB+tB,   mC,\n     mC,      mC+tC],\n\nwhere mC = 30. The maximum observation time is 500 hours. Find the optimal observation time and give the resulting allocation for each celestial body.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can set up a linear programming problem with the given constraints and then solve for the optimal observation time.\n\nLet tA, tB, and tC be the observation times for celestial bodies A, B, and C, respectively. We want to maximize the total observation time, which is given by the objective function:\n\nObjective: Maximize T = tA + tB + tC\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. tA + tB ≥ 120\n2. tB + tC ≥ 160\n3. tA + tB + tC ≥ 220\n4. tA + tB + tC ≤ 500\n\nNow we can solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method or any other optimization technique. The optimal solution is:\n\ntA = 70 hours\ntB = 50 hours\ntC = 80 hours\n\nThe total observation time is T = 70 + 50 + 80 = 200 hours. This allocation satisfies all the constraints and maximizes the total observation time."
