    "message_1": "What is the probability that at least 2 out of 5 performances of a certain type will result in a standing ovation, given that the probability of a standing ovation in each performance is 0.4?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success in each trial, and (1-p) is the probability of failure in each trial.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least 2 standing ovations out of 5 performances. So, we can find the probabilities for 2, 3, 4, and 5 standing ovations and then add them together.\n\nLet n = 5 (number of performances), p = 0.4 (probability of a standing ovation), and (1-p) = 0.6 (probability of no standing ovation).\n\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * 0.4^2 * 0.6^3\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.4^3 * 0.6^2\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.4^4 * 0.6^1\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * 0.4^5 * 0.6^0\n\nNow, we can calculate the combinations and probabilities:\n\nC(5, 2) = 10\nP(X = 2) = 10 * 0.4^2 * 0.6^3 = 10 * 0.16 * 0.216 = 0.3456\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.4^3 * 0.6^2 = 10 * 0.064 * 0.36 = 0.2304\n\nC(5, 4) = 5\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.4^4 * 0.6^1 = 5 * 0.0256 * 0.6 = 0.0768\n\nC(5, 5) = 1\nP(X = 5) = 1 * 0.4^5 * 0.6^0 = 1 * 0.01024 * 1 = 0.01024\n\nNow, we can add the probabilities together to find the probability of at least 2 standing ovations:\n\nP(X â‰¥ 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) = 0.3456 + 0.2304 + 0.0768 + 0.01024 = 0.66304\n\nSo, the probability of at least 2 out of 5 performances resulting in a standing ovation is approximately 0.663 or 66.3%."
