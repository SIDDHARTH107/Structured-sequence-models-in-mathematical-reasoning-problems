    "message_1": "A region has historically experienced an earthquake every 5 years on average. What is the probability of this region experiencing at least one earthquake in the next 2 years? Assume earthquakes occur independently of one another.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, earthquakes) happening in a fixed interval of time. The formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events, k is the number of events we want to find the probability for, λ (lambda) is the average number of events in the given time period, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, the region experiences an earthquake every 5 years on average, so λ = 2 years / 5 years = 0.4 earthquakes in 2 years.\n\nWe want to find the probability of experiencing at least one earthquake in the next 2 years, which is the complement of experiencing no earthquakes in the next 2 years. So, we will first find the probability of experiencing no earthquakes (k = 0) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.4) * 0.4^0) / 0! = e^(-0.4) * 1 / 1 = e^(-0.4)\n\nNow, we find the complement:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-0.4)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 0.67032 ≈ 0.32968\n\nSo, the probability of this region experiencing at least one earthquake in the next 2 years is approximately 32.97%."
