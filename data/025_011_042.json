    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve E(𝔽_11), we need to check all possible combinations of x and y values in the finite field 𝔽_11 and see if they satisfy the equation y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 8. We also need to include the point at infinity, which is always a part of an elliptic curve.\n\nThe finite field 𝔽_11 has 11 elements: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. We will check all combinations of x and y values and count the number of points that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe can create a table to keep track of the points:\n\nx  | y^2 | x^3 + 7x + 8 (mod 11)\n--------------------------------\n0  |  8  |       8\n1  |  3  |       3\n2  |  9  |       9\n3  |  5  |       5\n4  |  1  |       1\n5  |  0  |       0\n6  |  4  |       4\n7  |  2  |       2\n8  | 10  |      10\n9  |  6  |       6\n10 |  7  |       7\n\nFor each x value, there are either 1 or 2 corresponding y values that satisfy the equation. Counting the points, we have:\n\n(0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 8), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 10), (5, 0), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 10), (9, 3), (9, 8), (10, 4), (10, 7)\n\nThere are 20 points in the above list. Including the point at infinity, there are a total of 21 points on the elliptic curve E(𝔽_11)."
