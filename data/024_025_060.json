    "message_2": "To compute the first and second Chern classes of M, we first need to find the tangent bundle of M. Since M is a hypersurface in P^3, we can use the adjunction formula to find the tangent bundle of M. The adjunction formula states that:\n\nTM = TP^3|M - N_M,\n\nwhere TM is the tangent bundle of M, TP^3|M is the restriction of the tangent bundle of P^3 to M, and N_M is the normal bundle of M in P^3.\n\nIn our case, M is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1, so the normal bundle N_M is given by the line bundle O(2) (since the degree of the defining equation is 2). The tangent bundle of P^3 is given by TP^3 = O(1)^4 (since P^3 has four homogeneous coordinates). Therefore, the tangent bundle of M is given by:\n\nTM = O(1)^4 - O(2) = O(1)^3.\n\nNow we can compute the first Chern class c_1(TM) using the formula:\n\nc_1(TM) = c_1(O(1)^3) = 3 * c_1(O(1)).\n\nThe first Chern class of the line bundle O(1) is the generator of the Picard group of M, so we have:\n\nc_1(TM) = 3 * [O(1)].\n\nFor the second Chern class, we use the formula:\n\nc_2(TM) = (1/2) * (c_1(TM)^2 - c_1(TP^3|M) * c_1(TM)).\n\nSince c_1(TP^3|M) = 4 * [O(1)], we have:\n\nc_2(TM) = (1/2) * (9 * [O(1)]^2 - 4 * [O(1)] * 3 * [O(1)]) = (1/2) * (9 * [O(1)]^2 - 12 * [O(1)]^2) = -(3/2) * [O(1)]^2.\n\nSo the first and second Chern classes of M are:\n\nc_1(TM) = 3 * [O(1)],\nc_2(TM) = -(3/2) * [O(1)]^2."
