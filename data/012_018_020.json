    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 6 vertices and the following edges: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}, {5,6}. Determine the edge connectivity of this graph.",
    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. To find the edge connectivity, we can look for the minimum cut in the graph.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that by removing the edges {2,4} and {3,4}, the graph will be disconnected into two components: {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6}. There is no other way to disconnect the graph by removing only one edge. Therefore, the edge connectivity of this graph is 2."
