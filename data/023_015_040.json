    "message_1": "A cable of length 100 meters is used to transmit data signals between two points. The cable has a speed of propagation of 2x10^8 m/s. If a signal with a frequency of 20 kHz is transmitted through the cable, how long will it take for the signal to reach the other end? Use Fourier transform to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we don't actually need to use Fourier transform. We can simply use the speed, distance, and time relationship.\n\nThe speed of propagation (v) is given as 2x10^8 m/s, and the distance (d) is 100 meters. We need to find the time (t) it takes for the signal to travel this distance. We can use the formula:\n\nv = d/t\n\nRearranging the formula to find t:\n\nt = d/v\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nt = (100 m) / (2x10^8 m/s)\n\nt = 100 / 2x10^8 s\n\nt = 1 / 2x10^6 s\n\nt = 0.5x10^-6 s\n\nt = 0.5 Âµs\n\nSo, it will take 0.5 microseconds for the signal to reach the other end of the cable."
