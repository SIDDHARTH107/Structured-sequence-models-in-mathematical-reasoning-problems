A sample of 50 apples was taken and their weights (in grams) were recorded as follows: \n\n82, 78, 70, 95, 100, 72, 85, 88, 91, 96, 77, 75, 80, 81, 92, 89, 71, 86, 83, 82, 94, 87, 90, 73, 79, 84, 99, 98, 76, 72, 87, 81, 74, 77, 84, 85, 92, 93, 89, 82, 96, 81, 72, 75, 97, 88, 76, 92, 83, 85\n\nUsing bootstrap method, estimate the population average weight of the apples with 95% confidence interval.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the population average weight of the apples using the bootstrap method with a 95% confidence interval, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the sample mean.\n2. Resample the data with replacement (bootstrap) a large number of times (e.g., 1000 times) and calculate the mean of each resampled dataset.\n3. Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap means to form the 95% confidence interval.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the sample mean\n\nThe sum of the weights is 4298 grams. Divide this by the number of apples (50) to get the sample mean:\n\nSample mean = 4298 / 50 = 85.96 grams\n\nStep 2: Resample the data with replacement and calculate the mean of each resampled dataset\n\nWe will perform this step 1000 times. For each iteration, we will randomly select 50 apples with replacement from the original dataset and calculate the mean weight of the resampled dataset. Store these means in a list.\n\nStep 3: Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap means\n\nSort the list of bootstrap means and find the values at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. These values will form the 95% confidence interval for the population average weight of the apples.\n\nAssuming you have performed the bootstrap resampling and calculated the means, let's say the 2.5th percentile value is 83.5 grams and the 97.5th percentile value is 88.4 grams.\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the population average weight of the apples is (83.5, 88.4) grams."
