    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. If we use 16 rounds of encryption, how many total keys are involved in the encryption process?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, each round uses a subkey derived from the main key. Since there are 16 rounds of encryption, there will be 16 subkeys involved in the encryption process. The main key itself is not directly used in the encryption process, so the total number of keys involved is 16 subkeys."
