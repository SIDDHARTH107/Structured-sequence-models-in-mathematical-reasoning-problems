    "message_2": "To maximize the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 subject to the constraint g(x) = x - 2 <= 0, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nFirst, let's define the Lagrangian function L(x, λ) = f(x) - λg(x), where λ is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nL(x, λ) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 - λ(x - 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x and λ and set them equal to zero.\n\n∂L/∂x = 4x - 5 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x - 2 = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we find that x = 2. Plugging this value into the first equation:\n\n4(2) - 5 - λ = 0\n8 - 5 - λ = 0\nλ = 3\n\nNow that we have the values of x and λ, we can find the maximum value of the function f(x) by plugging the value of x back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = 2(2)^2 - 5(2) + 3\nf(2) = 8 - 10 + 3\nf(2) = 1\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 subject to the constraint g(x) = x - 2 <= 0 is 1, which occurs at x = 2."
