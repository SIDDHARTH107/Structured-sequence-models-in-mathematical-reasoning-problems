    "message_2": "The given boundary value problem is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The Fourier transform method is not the most suitable method to solve this problem. Instead, we can solve it using the method of characteristic equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation for the given ODE is:\n\n$r^2 + 4 = 0$\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n$r = \\pm 2i$\n\nSince the roots are complex conjugates, the general solution of the homogeneous ODE is:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x)$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\n1) $y(0) = 1$\n\n$1 = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0)$\n\n$1 = C_1$\n\n2) $y(\\pi) = 2$\n\n$2 = C_1 \\cos(2\\pi) + C_2 \\sin(2\\pi)$\n\n$2 = C_1$\n\nSince $C_1 = 1$, there is no solution that satisfies both boundary conditions. This indicates that the given boundary value problem has no solution."
