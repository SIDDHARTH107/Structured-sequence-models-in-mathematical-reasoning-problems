    "message_2": "To conduct a hierarchical clustering analysis using the single-linkage method, we first need to calculate the distance between each pair of data points. Then, we'll merge the closest points into a cluster and repeat the process until all points are in a single cluster. The single-linkage method uses the minimum distance between points in two clusters as the distance between the clusters.\n\nHere are the distances between each pair of data points:\n\n(2,5) = 3\n(5,9) = 4\n(9,12) = 3\n(12,16) = 4\n(16,19) = 3\n(19,22) = 3\n(22,25) = 3\n(25,29) = 4\n(29,31) = 2\n\nFirst merge:\nThe smallest distance is between 29 and 31, so we merge them into a cluster: {29, 31}.\n\nSecond merge:\nNow we need to find the smallest distance between the remaining individual points and the newly formed cluster {29, 31}. We'll compare the distances between the individual points and the closest point in the cluster.\n\n(25, {29, 31}) = min(25,29) = 4\n(22, {29, 31}) = min(22,29) = 7\n(19, {29, 31}) = min(19,29) = 10\n(16, {29, 31}) = min(16,29) = 13\n(12, {29, 31}) = min(12,29) = 17\n(9, {29, 31}) = min(9,29) = 20\n(5, {29, 31}) = min(5,29) = 24\n(2, {29, 31}) = min(2,29) = 27\n\nThe smallest distance is 4, between 25 and the cluster {29, 31}. So, the second merge will be {25, 29, 31}.\n\nThe distance between the clusters at the second merge is 4."
