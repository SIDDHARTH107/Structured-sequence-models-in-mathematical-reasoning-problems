    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the topic of Relevance Logic:\n\nLet's say you're given the following statements:\nStatement A: 2 + 2 = 5.\nStatement B: If 2 + 2 = 5, then 3 + 3 = 7.\n\nUsing the principles of relevance logic, is statement B relevant in determining the truth value of statement A?",
    "message_2": "In relevance logic, a statement is considered relevant if the truth of the statement depends on the truth of another statement. In this case, statement B is an implication (if-then statement) that depends on the truth of statement A.\n\nStatement A: 2 + 2 = 5 is false because 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nStatement B: If 2 + 2 = 5, then 3 + 3 = 7. This statement is an implication, and in classical logic, an implication is considered true if the antecedent (the part before \"then\") is false or if both the antecedent and consequent (the part after \"then\") are true.\n\nSince statement A is false, statement B is considered true in classical logic. However, in relevance logic, statement B is not relevant in determining the truth value of statement A because statement A is false independently of statement B. The truth value of statement A does not depend on the truth value of statement B."
