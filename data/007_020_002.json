    "message_2": "To encrypt the message M=23 using the RSA algorithm with the public key (n=77, e=7), Alice needs to compute the ciphertext C using the following formula:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nC ≡ 23^7 (mod 77)\n\nFirst, calculate 23^7:\n\n23^7 = 3404825447\n\nNow, find the remainder when dividing by 77:\n\nC = 3404825447 (mod 77) = 58\n\nSo, the ciphertext C that Alice should send to Bob is 58."
