    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors u and v, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product formula is:\nu · v = |u| * |v| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors, |u| is the magnitude of vector u, and |v| is the magnitude of vector v.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of u and v:\nu · v = (3 * -1) + (4 * 2) = -3 + 8 = 5\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n|u| = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5\n|v| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5)\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for cos(θ):\n5 = 5 * sqrt(5) * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 * sqrt(5):\ncos(θ) = 5 / (5 * sqrt(5))\n\nSimplify:\ncos(θ) = 1 / sqrt(5)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\nθ = arccos(1 / sqrt(5))\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\nθ ≈ 0.927 radians or ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors u and v is approximately 0.927 radians or 53.13 degrees."
