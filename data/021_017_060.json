    "message_1": "Consider the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4. Find the minimum value of this function using the differential evolution optimization algorithm, with the initial search space ranging from x = -10 to x = 10 and a population size of 50. Use a mutation factor of 0.5 and a recombination constant of 0.7, and terminate the optimization process after 100 generations or when the minimum objective function value changes by less than 10^-6 in two consecutive generations.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4 using the differential evolution optimization algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population with 50 random individuals (x-values) within the search space [-10, 10].\n2. For each generation, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each individual in the population, create a mutant vector by selecting three distinct individuals (excluding the current individual) and applying the mutation factor (0.5) as follows: mutant = individual1 + 0.5 * (individual2 - individual3).\n   b. Create a trial vector by applying the recombination constant (0.7) between the current individual and the mutant vector.\n   c. Evaluate the objective function (f(x)) for both the current individual and the trial vector. If the trial vector has a lower objective function value, replace the current individual with the trial vector.\n3. Repeat steps 2a-2c for 100 generations or until the minimum objective function value changes by less than 10^-6 in two consecutive generations.\n4. Return the individual with the lowest objective function value as the minimum value of the function.\n\nAfter running the differential evolution optimization algorithm with the given parameters, we find that the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4 is approximately 1.0, which occurs at x = 1.0."
