    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 60, which has prime factorization 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 12 (the index of 5 in the factorization) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so the possible values for n_3 are 1 and 10.\n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, they are both normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P and Q are both normal, their direct product PQ is also normal in G. Moreover, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 5 * 3 = 15, so PQ is a normal subgroup of G of order 15. By the factor group theorem, G/PQ is a group of order 4. Since there is only one group of order 4 up to isomorphism (the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4), G must be isomorphic to either C15 × C4 or C15 × V4. In either case, G is not isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or any of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 6 and n_3 = 10\nIf there are six Sylow 5-subgroups and ten Sylow 3-subgroups, then G cannot be abelian, as there is no abelian group with this property. Therefore, G must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, G can either be isomorphic to C15 × C4 or C15 × V4 in the first case, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60 in the second case. It is not possible for G to be isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2."
