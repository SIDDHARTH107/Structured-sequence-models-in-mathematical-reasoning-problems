    "message_1": "In a manufacturing plant, there is a 0.05 probability that any given worker will have a workplace accident within a year. If there are 100 workers in the plant, what is the probability that at least 5 of them will have a workplace accident within a year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, workplace accidents) in n trials (number of workers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, having a workplace accident) = 0.05\n- n is the number of trials (number of workers) = 100\n- k is the number of successes (number of workers having accidents) we are interested in\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 5 workers will have a workplace accident within a year. To do this, we can find the probability that fewer than 5 workers have accidents and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(at least 5 accidents) = 1 - P(0 accidents) - P(1 accident) - P(2 accidents) - P(3 accidents) - P(4 accidents)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 accidents using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(0 accidents) = C(100, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0)\nP(1 accident) = C(100, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1)\nP(2 accidents) = C(100, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2)\nP(3 accidents) = C(100, 3) * (0.05)^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3)\nP(4 accidents) = C(100, 4) * (0.05)^4 * (1-0.05)^(100-4)\n\nCalculating these probabilities, we get:\n\nP(0 accidents) ≈ 0.00592\nP(1 accident) ≈ 0.03116\nP(2 accidents) ≈ 0.08118\nP(3 accidents) ≈ 0.13956\nP(4 accidents) ≈ 0.17814\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 5 accidents:\n\nP(at least 5 accidents) = 1 - P(0 accidents) - P(1 accident) - P(2 accidents) - P(3 accidents) - P(4 accidents)\nP(at least 5 accidents) ≈ 1 - 0.00592 - 0.03116 - 0.08118 - 0.13956 - 0.17814\nP(at least 5 accidents) ≈ 0.56404\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 workers will have a workplace accident within a year is approximately 0.564 or 56.4%."
