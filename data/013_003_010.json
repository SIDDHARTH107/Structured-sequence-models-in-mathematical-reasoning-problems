    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A has $10 to split with Player B. Player A proposes a split of x dollars for themselves and (10-x) dollars for Player B. Player B can either accept or reject the offer. If Player B accepts, both players receive their proposed shares of the money. If Player B rejects, both players receive nothing. \n\nBased on this scenario, what is the smallest value of x that Player A should offer to ensure that Player B will accept the offer instead of rejecting it?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the smallest value of x that Player A should offer to ensure that Player B will accept the offer instead of rejecting it depends on the rationality and preferences of Player B. If Player B is completely rational and prefers any amount of money over nothing, then the smallest value of x that Player A can offer is $0.01, giving Player B $9.99. This is because even though the split is highly unfair, Player B would still prefer to have $9.99 rather than nothing. However, in real-life situations, people may not always act rationally and may reject unfair offers. Therefore, the smallest value of x that guarantees acceptance may be higher and depend on the specific preferences of Player B."
