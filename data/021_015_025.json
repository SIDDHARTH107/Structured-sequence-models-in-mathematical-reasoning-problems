    "message_2": "To solve this problem using particle swarm optimization (PSO), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm with 20 particles.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle.\n3. Update the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) positions.\n4. Update the velocity and position of each particle.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence.\n\nSince this is a mathematical problem, we will provide a general outline of the algorithm rather than a specific numerical solution.\n\n1. Initialization:\n- Create 20 particles with random positions within the range x = [-10, 10].\n- Set the initial velocities to random values within a reasonable range (e.g., [-1, 1]).\n\n2. Fitness evaluation:\n- Calculate the fitness of each particle using the function f(x) = -x^2.\n\n3. Update pbest and gbest:\n- For each particle, compare its current fitness to its personal best fitness. If the current fitness is better, update the pbest position.\n- Compare the fitness of each particle to the global best fitness. If a particle's fitness is better than the current gbest, update the gbest position.\n\n4. Update velocity and position:\n- For each particle, update its velocity using the following formula:\n  new_velocity = w * current_velocity + c1 * rand1 * (pbest_position - current_position) + c2 * rand2 * (gbest_position - current_position)\n  where w is the inertia weight, c1 and c2 are acceleration constants, and rand1 and rand2 are random numbers between 0 and 1.\n- Update the position of each particle using the formula:\n  new_position = current_position + new_velocity\n\n5. Convergence:\n- Repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of iterations or until the change in gbest position is below a certain threshold.\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm until convergence, the maximum value of the function f(x) = -x^2 within the range x = [-10, 10] will be found at the gbest position. Since the function is a simple parabola, we can expect the maximum value to be 0, which occurs at x = 0. However, due to the stochastic nature of the PSO algorithm, the result may not be exactly 0, but it should be very close."
