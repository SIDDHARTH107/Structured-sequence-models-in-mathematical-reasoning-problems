    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, we first need to calculate the public keys for Alice and Bob.\n\nAlice's public key (A) can be calculated as follows:\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 5^6 mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 10\n\nBob's public key (B) can be calculated as follows:\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 5^15 mod 23\nB = 30517578125 mod 23\nB = 14\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using each other's public keys.\n\nShared secret key for Alice (S_A) can be calculated as follows:\nS_A = B^a mod p\nS_A = 14^6 mod 23\nS_A = 7529536 mod 23\nS_A = 18\n\nShared secret key for Bob (S_B) can be calculated as follows:\nS_B = A^b mod p\nS_B = 10^15 mod 23\nS_B = 1000000000000000 mod 23\nS_B = 18\n\nSince S_A and S_B are equal, the shared secret key they will use for their communication is 18."
