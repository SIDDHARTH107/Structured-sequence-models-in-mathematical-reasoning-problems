    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph, we need to determine the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 10 vertices. This can be achieved by forming a tree, where each vertex has exactly one parent, except for the root. In this case, the graph would have 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\nNow, our graph has 15 edges, which is 6 more than the minimum required for a connected graph with 10 vertices. We can use these additional edges to reduce the diameter of the graph.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario for the diameter of a tree with 10 vertices. This would be a straight line, where each vertex is connected to exactly two other vertices, except for the endpoints which are connected to only one other vertex. In this case, the diameter would be 9, as it would take 9 steps to traverse from one end to the other.\n\nNow, let's try to reduce the diameter by adding the 6 additional edges. We can connect vertices that are far apart in the tree to create shortcuts. For example, we can connect the vertices at distance 2, 4, 6, and 8 from the starting vertex to the starting vertex itself. This would reduce the diameter to 5, as the maximum distance between any two vertices would now be 5.\n\nWe can further reduce the diameter by adding the remaining 2 edges. For example, we can connect the vertices at distance 3 and 7 from the starting vertex to the starting vertex. This would reduce the diameter to 3, as the maximum distance between any two vertices would now be 3.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the connected undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges is 3."
