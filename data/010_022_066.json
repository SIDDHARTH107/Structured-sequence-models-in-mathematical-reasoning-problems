    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius of the cylinder is 2 cm, the area of one circular base is:\n\nA_base = π(2)^2 = 4π square centimeters\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n\n2 * A_base = 2 * 4π = 8π square centimeters\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is the area of the rectangle that wraps around the cylinder, which can be found using the formula A_lateral = 2πrh, where r is the radius, h is the height, and A_lateral is the lateral surface area.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 2 cm and the height (h) is 6 cm, the lateral surface area is:\n\nA_lateral = 2π(2)(6) = 24π square centimeters\n\nFinally, we add the area of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = 8π + 24π = 32π square centimeters"
