    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve or the flowsnake, is a space-filling curve that increases in length with each iteration. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength of curve after n iterations = (side length) * (7^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 1. We want to find the total length of the first six iterations, so we'll calculate the length of the curve for each iteration and then sum them up.\n\nLength after 1st iteration = 1 * (7^1) = 7\nLength after 2nd iteration = 1 * (7^2) = 49\nLength after 3rd iteration = 1 * (7^3) = 343\nLength after 4th iteration = 1 * (7^4) = 2401\nLength after 5th iteration = 1 * (7^5) = 16807\nLength after 6th iteration = 1 * (7^6) = 117649\n\nTotal length of the first six iterations = 7 + 49 + 343 + 2401 + 16807 + 117649 = 137256"
