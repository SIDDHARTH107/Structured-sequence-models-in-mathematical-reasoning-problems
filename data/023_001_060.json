    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n for the series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\n\nTo compute the integral, we use the power rule:\n\n∫ x^2 dx = (1/3) * x^3\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral from -π to π:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3) * π^3 - (1/3) * (-π)^3] = (1/π) * (2/3) * π^3 = (2/3) * π^2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\n\nIntegration by parts is needed here:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx\nThen, du = 2x dx, v = (1/n) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we compute the integral:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du = x^2 * (1/n) * sin(nx) - ∫ (1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x dx\n\nLet's do integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = 2x, dv = sin(nx) dx\nThen, du = 2 dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nNow, we compute the integral:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du = 2x * (-1/n) * cos(nx) - ∫ (-1/n) * cos(nx) * 2 dx\n\n= -2x * (1/n) * cos(nx) + (2/n) * ∫ cos(nx) dx\n\n= -2x * (1/n) * cos(nx) + (2/n^2) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we plug this back into our expression for a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [x^2 * (1/n) * sin(nx) - (-2x * (1/n) * cos(nx) + (2/n^2) * sin(nx))]|[-π, π]\n\nAfter evaluating the expression at the limits, we find that the sin terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\na_n = (4/πn^2) * (-1)^n\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince the function x^2 is even and sin(nx) is odd, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x^2:\n\nf(x) = (2/3) * π^2 + Σ [(4/πn^2) * (-1)^n * cos(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity."
