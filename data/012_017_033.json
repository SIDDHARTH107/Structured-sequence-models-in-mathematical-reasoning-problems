    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices in the graph such that each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex. In other words, it's a pairing of the vertices.\n\nFor a graph with 10 vertices, we can think of this as pairing up the vertices in sets of 2. The first vertex can be paired with any of the remaining 9 vertices. Once that pair is formed, the next vertex can be paired with any of the remaining 7 vertices, and so on. \n\nSo, the number of perfect matchings can be calculated as:\n\n(9 choices for the first vertex) * (7 choices for the second vertex) * (5 choices for the third vertex) * (3 choices for the fourth vertex) * (1 choice for the fifth vertex)\n\n9 * 7 * 5 * 3 * 1 = 945\n\nTherefore, there are 945 perfect matchings in a graph with 10 vertices."
