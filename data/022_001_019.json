    "message_2": "To find the Laurent expansion of f(z) around the point z = 0, we will first rewrite the function in a more convenient form. We can do this by performing a partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = (1 - z)/(z - 3) = A/(z - 3) + B\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can multiply both sides by (z - 3) and then solve for A and B:\n\n1 - z = A + B(z - 3)\n\nNow, let's find A and B:\n\nFor z = 3, we have 1 - 3 = A, so A = -2.\n\nFor z = 0, we have 1 - 0 = -2 + 3B, so B = 1/3.\n\nNow we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = -2/(z - 3) + (1/3)\n\nNow, we want to find the Laurent expansion of f(z) around z = 0. To do this, we will rewrite the first term in the form of a geometric series:\n\n-2/(z - 3) = -2/(1 - (z - 1)) = -2 * (1/(1 - (z - 1)))\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n1/(1 - x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nSo, we have:\n\n-2 * (1/(1 - (z - 1))) = -2 * (1 + (z - 1) + (z - 1)^2 + (z - 1)^3 + ...)\n\nNow, we can expand this series:\n\n-2 * (1 + (z - 1) + (z - 1)^2 + (z - 1)^3 + ...) = -2 - 2(z - 1) - 2(z - 1)^2 - 2(z - 1)^3 - ...\n\nNow, we can combine this series with the second term of f(z):\n\nf(z) = -2 - 2(z - 1) - 2(z - 1)^2 - 2(z - 1)^3 - ... + (1/3)\n\nFinally, we have the Laurent expansion of f(z) around z = 0:\n\nf(z) = (1/3) - 2z + z^2 - 2z^3 + ..."
