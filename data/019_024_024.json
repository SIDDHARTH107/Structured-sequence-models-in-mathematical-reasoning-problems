    "message_1": "A bag contains 4 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 9 green balls. If a ball is drawn randomly from the bag, what is the probability that it is a red ball, given that it is not a blue ball?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the ball is red given that it is not blue, we can use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where A is the event of drawing a red ball and B is the event of not drawing a blue ball.\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of not drawing a blue ball (P(B)). There are a total of 20 balls in the bag (4 red + 7 blue + 9 green), so the probability of not drawing a blue ball is:\n\nP(B) = (Total number of balls - Number of blue balls) / Total number of balls\nP(B) = (20 - 7) / 20\nP(B) = 13 / 20\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of drawing a red ball and not drawing a blue ball (P(A and B)). Since not drawing a blue ball means either drawing a red or green ball, we can simply find the probability of drawing a red ball:\n\nP(A and B) = Number of red balls / Total number of balls (excluding blue balls)\nP(A and B) = 4 / 13\n\nNow, we can find the conditional probability P(A|B):\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\nP(A|B) = (4 / 13) / (13 / 20)\nP(A|B) = (4 / 13) * (20 / 13)\nP(A|B) = 4 / 13\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball given that it is not a blue ball is 4/13."
