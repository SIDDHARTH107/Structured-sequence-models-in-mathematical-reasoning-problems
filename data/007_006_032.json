    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 84 and 132 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform a series of divisions with remainder, replacing the dividend with the divisor and the divisor with the remainder, until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nStep 1:\nDivide 132 by 84:\n132 = 84 * 1 + 48\n\nStep 2:\nReplace the dividend (132) with the divisor (84) and the divisor (84) with the remainder (48):\n84 = 48 * 1 + 36\n\nStep 3:\nReplace the dividend (84) with the divisor (48) and the divisor (48) with the remainder (36):\n48 = 36 * 1 + 12\n\nStep 4:\nReplace the dividend (48) with the divisor (36) and the divisor (36) with the remainder (12):\n36 = 12 * 3 + 0\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is 12, so the GCD of 84 and 132 is 12."
