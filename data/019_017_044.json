    "message_2": "This sentence is true.\n\nThe sentence ∀x ∃y (x < y × y) can be translated to: \"For all x, there exists a y such that x is less than the product of y and y.\"\n\nProof:\n\nLet's consider any arbitrary x. We want to show that there exists a y such that x < y × y.\n\nLet y = x + 1. Then, we have:\n\ny × y = (x + 1) × (x + 1) = x^2 + 2x + 1\n\nNow, we want to show that x < x^2 + 2x + 1.\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n0 < x^2 + x + 1\n\nSince x^2 is always non-negative, and x^2 + x + 1 is strictly positive for all x, the inequality holds true.\n\nThus, for any arbitrary x, we have found a y (specifically, y = x + 1) such that x < y × y. Therefore, the sentence ∀x ∃y (x < y × y) is true."
