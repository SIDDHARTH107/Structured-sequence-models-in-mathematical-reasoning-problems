    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nThe given equation is: $y^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x$\n\nLet $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 4x + 5$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0 \\Rightarrow -3x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0 \\Rightarrow 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nFor the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now we need to find the x values that satisfy the first equation:\n\n$-3x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = -3$, $b = -4$, and $c = 5$\n\n$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(-3)(5)}}{2(-3)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{76}}{-6}$\n\nSo, we have two x values:\n\n$x_1 = \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{76}}{-6}$\n\n$x_2 = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{76}}{-6}$\n\nThus, the singular points of the curve are:\n\n$(x_1, y) = \\left(\\frac{4 + \\sqrt{76}}{-6}, 0\\right)$\n\n$(x_2, y) = \\left(\\frac{4 - \\sqrt{76}}{-6}, 0\\right)$"
