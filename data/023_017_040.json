    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Fourier analysis method to find the flow rate at a distance of 10 km from the input. We will use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to determine the pressure drop along the pipeline and then apply Fourier analysis to find the flow rate at the given distance.\n\nThe Hagen-Poiseuille equation for pressure drop (ΔP) in a circular pipe is given by:\n\nΔP = (8 * μ * L * Q) / (π * R^4)\n\nwhere:\nμ = viscosity = 0.01 Pa.s\nL = length of the pipe = 10,000 m (10 km)\nQ = flow rate = 100 m³/s\nR = radius of the pipe = 2 m\n\nFirst, let's find the pressure drop (ΔP):\n\nΔP = (8 * 0.01 * 10000 * 100) / (π * 2^4)\nΔP = (80000) / (50.27)\nΔP ≈ 1591.5 Pa\n\nNow, we will use Fourier analysis to find the flow rate at a distance of 10 km from the input. The Fourier series representation of the flow rate (Q) as a function of distance (x) along the pipe can be written as:\n\nQ(x) = Q₀ + Σ [Qₙ * cos(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere:\nQ₀ = average flow rate\nQₙ = amplitude of the nth harmonic\nn = harmonic number\nx = distance along the pipe\n\nSince the flow rate is constant along the pipe, the Fourier series will only have the constant term (Q₀) and no harmonics. Therefore, the flow rate at any distance (x) along the pipe will be equal to the input flow rate:\n\nQ(x) = Q₀ = 100 m³/s\n\nSo, the flow rate at a distance of 10 km from the input is 100 m³/s."
