    "message_2": "In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 13 cards of each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Since we want to find the probability of drawing a heart or a diamond, we need to consider the total number of heart and diamond cards, which is 13 + 13 = 26.\n\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes (heart or diamond cards) by the total number of possible outcomes (total cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 26 (heart or diamond cards) / 52 (total cards in the deck)\n\nProbability = 1/2 or 50%\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a heart or a diamond from a standard deck of 52 cards is 50%."
