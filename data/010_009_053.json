    "message_1": "Consider the 3-dimensional cube with side length 1. It has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces. \n\nConstruct a triangulation and subdivision of this cube such that each face is split into four triangles, each edge is split into two line segments, and all resulting vertices lie on the original cube's vertices, edges, or faces.\n\nHow many triangles are in this triangulation, and how many vertices are there in total?",
    "message_2": "To construct the triangulation and subdivision, we can start by adding a new vertex at the midpoint of each edge of the cube. Since there are 12 edges, we will add 12 new vertices. Now, we can connect these new vertices to form triangles within each face of the cube.\n\nEach face of the cube will be split into four triangles, as follows: connect the midpoints of the four edges of the face, forming a smaller square inside the face. Then, connect the diagonals of this smaller square, which will split the face into four triangles.\n\nSince there are 6 faces, and each face is split into 4 triangles, there will be a total of 6 * 4 = 24 triangles in the triangulation.\n\nFor the total number of vertices, we have the original 8 vertices of the cube, plus the 12 new vertices we added at the midpoints of the edges, for a total of 8 + 12 = 20 vertices."
