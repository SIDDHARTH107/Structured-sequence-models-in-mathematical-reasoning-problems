If the region contains the points $z_1 = 1+i$ and $z_2 = 2-i$, show that there exists a biholomorphic map from the unit disk to the region that sends $0$ to $z_1$ and $1$ to $z_2$. \n\nFind the explicit form of this biholomorphic map.",
    "message_2": "To find a biholomorphic map from the unit disk to the given region, we will use the Riemann mapping theorem, which states that there exists a biholomorphic map between any simply connected region (excluding the whole complex plane) and the unit disk.\n\nFirst, we need to find a biholomorphic map from the unit disk to the upper half-plane. The standard map for this is the Cayley transform:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - i}{z + i}$$\n\nNow, we want to find a Möbius transformation that maps the upper half-plane to the region containing $z_1 = 1 + i$ and $z_2 = 2 - i$. Let's call this transformation $g(z)$. We want $g(z)$ to satisfy the following conditions:\n\n$$g(0) = 1 + i$$\n$$g(1) = 2 - i$$\n\nA Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nWe can use the conditions above to find the coefficients $a, b, c, d$. Plugging in $z = 0$, we get:\n\n$$g(0) = \\frac{b}{d} = 1 + i \\implies b = d(1 + i)$$\n\nPlugging in $z = 1$, we get:\n\n$$g(1) = \\frac{a + b}{c + d} = 2 - i$$\n\nSubstituting $b = d(1 + i)$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{a + d(1 + i)}{c + d} = 2 - i$$\n\nNow, let's set $d = 1$ (we can do this since Möbius transformations are determined up to a constant factor). Then, $b = 1 + i$ and we have:\n\n$$\\frac{a + 1 + i}{c + 1} = 2 - i$$\n\nSolving for $a$ and $c$, we get $a = 1 - i$ and $c = -i$. Thus, the Möbius transformation $g(z)$ is given by:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{(1 - i)z + (1 + i)}{-iz + 1}$$\n\nFinally, the biholomorphic map from the unit disk to the region containing $z_1$ and $z_2$ is the composition of the Cayley transform and the Möbius transformation:\n\n$$h(z) = g(f(z)) = g\\left(\\frac{z - i}{z + i}\\right) = \\frac{(1 - i)\\left(\\frac{z - i}{z + i}\\right) + (1 + i)}{-i\\left(\\frac{z - i}{z + i}\\right) + 1}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$h(z) = \\frac{(1 - i)(z - i) + (1 + i)(z + i)}{-i(z - i) + (z + i)} = \\frac{(2z + 2i)}{(1 - i)z + (1 + i)}$$\n\nSo the explicit form of the biholomorphic map is:\n\n$$h(z) = \\frac{2z + 2i}{(1 - i)z + (1 + i)}$$"
