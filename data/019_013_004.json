    "message_2": "To find the elements related to 5 in R, we need to find all integers y such that x + y = 10, where x = 5. \n\n5 + y = 10\ny = 10 - 5\ny = 5\n\nSo, the only element related to 5 in R is 5 itself. Therefore, the smallest subset of integers that contains all elements related to 5 in R (including 5 itself) is {5}. The cardinality of this subset is 1."
