    "message_2": "To find the possible number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we first analyze the prime factorization of 60. We have 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. Now, we will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the prime factor 2:\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 * 5 = 15, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15. If n_2 = 1, there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. If n_2 = 3 or 15, the Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal.\n\nFor the prime factor 3:\nThe number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 * 5 = 20, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10. If n_3 = 1, there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. If n_3 = 10, the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal.\n\nFor the prime factor 5:\nThe number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^2 * 3 = 12, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, there is a normal Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. If n_5 = 6, the Sylow 5-subgroups are not normal.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of normal and non-normal Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If all the Sylow subgroups are normal (n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1), then the group is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which gives us an abelian group Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_5 ≅ Z_60. This is not a non-abelian group, so we discard this case.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 6, then the group has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, and non-normal Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_3 × Z_5) ⋊ Z_4. Since Z_4 has two possible automorphisms (identity and inversion), there are two possible non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n3. If n_2 = 3 or 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 6, then the group has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and non-normal Sylow 2 and 5-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_2^2 × Z_5) ⋊ Z_3. Since Z_3 has only one non-trivial automorphism (cyclic permutation), there is only one possible non-abelian group in this case.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 or 15, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 1, then the group has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, and non-normal Sylow 2 and 3-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_2^2 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_5. Since Z_5 has four non-trivial automorphisms (cyclic permutations), there are four possible non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 possible non-abelian groups of order 60. Each of these groups has a unique structure up to isomorphism, as they are determined by the semi-direct product structure and the choice of automorphisms for the respective normal subgroups."
