    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector v onto vector u using trigonometry, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can do this using the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\n1. Find the dot product of vectors u and v:\nu · v = (4 * 2) + (-3 * 5) = 8 - 15 = -7\n\n2. Find the magnitudes of vectors u and v:\n||u|| = √(4^2 + (-3)^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n||v|| = √(2^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\n3. Find the cosine of the angle between vectors u and v:\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| ||v||) = (-7) / (5 * √29) = -7 / (5√29)\n\n4. Find the length of the projection of vector v onto vector u:\nproj_length = ||v|| * cos(θ) = √29 * (-7 / (5√29)) = -7/5\n\n5. Find the unit vector in the direction of vector u:\nunit_u = u / ||u|| = [4/5, -3/5]\n\n6. Find the projection of vector v onto vector u:\nproj_v = proj_length * unit_u = (-7/5) * [4/5, -3/5] = [(-7/5)*(4/5), (-7/5)*(-3/5)] = [-28/25, 21/25]\n\nSo, the projection of vector v onto vector u is [-28/25, 21/25]."
