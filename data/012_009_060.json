    "message_2": "To determine the possible values for x, we need to consider the Handshaking Lemma and the properties of a graph.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In other words, the sum of the degree sequence must be an even number.\n\nLet's first calculate the sum of the given degree sequence without x:\n\n2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 16\n\nNow, we need to add x to this sum and make sure it's an even number:\n\n16 + x = even number\n\nSince 16 is already an even number, x must also be even to maintain the even sum. Therefore, the possible values for x are even numbers. However, we also need to consider the properties of a graph with 7 vertices.\n\nThe maximum degree of a vertex in a simple graph with 7 vertices is 6 (it can connect to all other 6 vertices). So, x can be any even number between 0 and 6, inclusive. However, x cannot be 0, because that would mean one vertex is isolated, and the other vertices with degree 2 would not be able to satisfy their degree requirements.\n\nThus, the possible values for x are 2, 4, and 6."
