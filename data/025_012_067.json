    "message_2": "To double a point P = (x1, y1) on an elliptic curve, we need to find the tangent line at P and then find its intersection with the curve. The result will be the point -R, and we need to reflect it over the x-axis to get the final result, R.\n\nThe equation of the elliptic curve is y² = x³ + 3x + 5. We can differentiate this equation with respect to x to find the slope of the tangent line at P:\n\ndy/dx = (d/dx)(x³ + 3x + 5)\ndy²/dx = 3x² + 3\n\nNow, we can plug in the coordinates of P (x1 = 2, y1 = -1) to find the slope of the tangent line at P:\n\n(dy/dx) = 3(2)² + 3 = 15\n\nNow, we have the slope of the tangent line, m = 15. We can use the point-slope form to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\ny + 1 = 15(x - 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this tangent line with the elliptic curve. We can substitute the equation of the tangent line into the equation of the curve:\n\n(y + 1)² = x³ + 3x + 5\n\nNow, we can substitute the x-coordinate of P (x1 = 2) into the equation of the tangent line to find the x-coordinate of -R:\n\nx³ + 3x + 5 = (15(x - 2) - 1)²\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx³ - 15x² + 90x - 121 = 0\n\nWe know that x = 2 is a solution to this equation (corresponding to the point P), so we can factor it out:\n\n(x - 2)(x² - 13x + 61) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the other root of the quadratic factor. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (13 ± √(13² - 4 * 61)) / 2\nx = (13 ± √(169 - 244)) / 2\nx = (13 ± √(-75)) / 2\n\nSince we are working over a field with characteristic different from 2 and 3, the square root of -75 exists in the field. Let's denote it as a, so the x-coordinate of -R is x = (13 + a) / 2.\n\nNow, we can plug this x-coordinate back into the equation of the tangent line to find the y-coordinate of -R:\n\ny + 1 = 15((13 + a) / 2 - 2)\ny = 15((13 + a) / 2 - 2) - 1\n\nNow, we can reflect -R over the x-axis to find the final result, R:\n\nR = ((13 + a) / 2, -15((13 + a) / 2 - 2) + 1)\n\nSo, the result of doubling P is R = ((13 + a) / 2, -15((13 + a) / 2 - 2) + 1), where a is the square root of -75 in the field F."
