    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that as the number of levels increases, the curve becomes more complex and fills more space. To find the total length of the Peano curve up to level 5, we need to calculate the length of the curve at each level and then sum them up.\n\nAt level 0, the curve is a straight line of length 1.\n\nAt level 1, the curve is made up of 8 smaller copies of the previous level (level 0). So, the length of the curve at level 1 is 8 times the length of the curve at level 0:\n\nLength at level 1 = 8 * Length at level 0 = 8 * 1 = 8\n\nAt level 2, the curve is made up of 8 smaller copies of the previous level (level 1). So, the length of the curve at level 2 is 8 times the length of the curve at level 1:\n\nLength at level 2 = 8 * Length at level 1 = 8 * 8 = 64\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the length of the curve at levels 3, 4, and 5:\n\nLength at level 3 = 8 * Length at level 2 = 8 * 64 = 512\nLength at level 4 = 8 * Length at level 3 = 8 * 512 = 4096\nLength at level 5 = 8 * Length at level 4 = 8 * 4096 = 32768\n\nNow, we can sum up the lengths of the curve at all levels up to level 5:\n\nTotal length = Length at level 0 + Length at level 1 + Length at level 2 + Length at level 3 + Length at level 4 + Length at level 5\nTotal length = 1 + 8 + 64 + 512 + 4096 + 32768\nTotal length = 36449\n\nSo, the total length of the Peano curve up to level 5 is 36,449."
