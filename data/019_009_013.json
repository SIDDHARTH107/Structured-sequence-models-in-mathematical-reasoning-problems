    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to intuitionistic logic:\n\nMary and Tom are playing a game. Mary says, \"If I win three games in a row, then I will win the whole competition.\" However, Tom is good at breaking the rules. He believes that Mary will not win the next game. If we assume that intuitionistic logic applies to this situation, and we know that Mary has won the previous two games, what is the probability that Mary will win the competition? \n\nPlease note that intuitionistic logic is a specific type of logic that departs from classical logic in certain respects. It is an important field of study within mathematical logic.",
    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, we cannot determine the probability of an event occurring without more information about the event. Intuitionistic logic does not adhere to the law of excluded middle, which states that a proposition is either true or false. In this case, we cannot simply assume that Mary will either win or lose the next game.\n\nTo determine the probability of Mary winning the competition, we would need more information about the game, such as the probability of Mary winning a single game or any other factors that could influence the outcome.\n\nWithout this additional information, we cannot provide a precise numerical probability for Mary winning the competition under intuitionistic logic."
