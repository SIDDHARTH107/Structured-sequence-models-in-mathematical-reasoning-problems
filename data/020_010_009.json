    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The production process is subject to uncertainty, and the demand for each product also varies. The company wants to optimize its production plan by minimizing the maximum possible cost deviation. The manufacturing cost of product A is $50 per unit and for product B is $70 per unit. The demand for product A is uncertain and can vary between 1000 and 3000 units with equal probability distribution while the demand for product B is uncertain and can vary between 500 and 2000 units with equal probability distribution. The company can produce a maximum of 4000 units of both products combined. The company wants to determine the optimal production plan for each product to minimize the worst-case cost deviation with 95% certainty. Find the optimal production plan for both products.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production plan, we will use the minimax regret criterion. This criterion aims to minimize the maximum possible regret (cost deviation) in the worst-case scenario. We will consider the 95% certainty level for demand, which means we will focus on the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the demand distribution.\n\nFirst, let's find the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles for the demand of each product:\n\nFor product A:\nRange = 3000 - 1000 = 2000\n2.5% percentile = 1000 + 0.025 * 2000 = 1050\n97.5% percentile = 1000 + 0.975 * 2000 = 2950\n\nFor product B:\nRange = 2000 - 500 = 1500\n2.5% percentile = 500 + 0.025 * 1500 = 537.5 ≈ 538\n97.5% percentile = 500 + 0.975 * 1500 = 1962.5 ≈ 1963\n\nNow, let's create a table with the possible production plans and their corresponding regrets (cost deviations) for each demand percentile:\n\nProduction Plan | Regret (2.5% percentile) | Regret (97.5% percentile)\n----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------\n(1050, 2950)    | 0                        | 0\n(2950, 1050)    | (2950-1050)*50 + (1050-538)*70 | (2950-2950)*50 + (1050-1963)*70\n(4000, 0)       | (4000-1050)*50           | (4000-2950)*50\n(0, 4000)       | 0                        | (0-2950)*50 + (4000-1963)*70\n\nCalculating the regrets:\n\nProduction Plan | Regret (2.5% percentile) | Regret (97.5% percentile)\n----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------\n(1050, 2950)    | 0                        | 0\n(2950, 1050)    | 1900*50 + 512*70          | 0 + 913*70\n(4000, 0)       | 2950*50                  | 1050*50\n(0, 4000)       | 0                        | 2950*50 + 2037*70\n\nProduction Plan | Regret (2.5% percentile) | Regret (97.5% percentile)\n----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------\n(1050, 2950)    | 0                        | 0\n(2950, 1050)    | 95,000 + 35,840          | 0 + 63,910\n(4000, 0)       | 147,500                  | 52,500\n(0, 4000)       | 0                        | 147,500 + 142,590\n\nNow, we will find the maximum regret for each production plan:\n\nProduction Plan | Maximum Regret\n----------------|---------------\n(1050, 2950)    | 0\n(2950, 1050)    | 130,840\n(4000, 0)       | 147,500\n(0, 4000)       | 290,090\n\nThe optimal production plan is the one with the minimum maximum regret, which is (1050, 2950). The company should produce 1050 units of product A and 2950 units of product B to minimize the worst-case cost deviation with 95% certainty."
