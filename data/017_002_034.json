    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we need to find all the divisors of the order of G, which is 20. The divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. For each divisor d, there is a unique subgroup of order d, generated by the element a^(20/d). Let's find these subgroups and their generators:\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1 (trivial subgroup):\nH = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. The generator of this subgroup is h = e.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2:\nH = {e, a^10}. The generator of this subgroup is h = a^10.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 4:\nH = {e, a^5, a^10, a^15}. The generator of this subgroup is h = a^5.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 5:\nH = {e, a^4, a^8, a^12, a^16}. The generator of this subgroup is h = a^4.\n\n5. Subgroup of order 10:\nH = {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10, a^12, a^14, a^16, a^18}. The generator of this subgroup is h = a^2.\n\n6. Subgroup of order 20 (the whole group G):\nH = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11, a^12, a^13, a^14, a^15, a^16, a^17, a^18, a^19}. The generator of this subgroup is h = a.\n\nIn summary, the subgroups of G and their generators are:\n\n1. {e}, generated by e.\n2. {e, a^10}, generated by a^10.\n3. {e, a^5, a^10, a^15}, generated by a^5.\n4. {e, a^4, a^8, a^12, a^16}, generated by a^4.\n5. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10, a^12, a^14, a^16, a^18}, generated by a^2.\n6. {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11, a^12, a^13, a^14, a^15, a^16, a^17, a^18, a^19}, generated by a."
