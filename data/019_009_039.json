    "message_2": "Let's examine the given formula and the statements A and B.\n\nFormula: If A implies B and A implies not B, then not A.\n\nA: x is a rational number\nB: x^2 is rational\n\nFirst, we need to check if A implies B. If x is a rational number, then x can be expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers and q â‰  0. Then x^2 = (p/q)^2 = p^2/q^2, which is also a fraction and thus a rational number. So, A implies B.\n\nNow, we need to check if A implies not B. In this case, not B would mean that x^2 is not rational. However, we have already shown that if x is a rational number, then x^2 is also rational. So, A does not imply not B.\n\nSince A implies B but A does not imply not B, the given formula does not hold in this case. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the statement \"not A\" (x is not a rational number) is true or false based on the given formula and statements A and B."
