    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 60 heads in 100 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (coin flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (heads), p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin), q is the probability of failure (1-p, also 0.5 for a fair coin), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!)).\n\nWe want to find the probability of getting at least 60 heads, so we need to calculate the probabilities for getting 60, 61, 62, ..., 100 heads and then sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 60) = P(X = 60) + P(X = 61) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula and then sum them up:\n\nP(X ≥ 60) = Σ [(100Ck) * (0.5^k) * (0.5^(100-k))] for k = 60 to 100\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 60) ≈ 0.0284\n\nSo the probability of getting at least 60 heads in 100 coin flips is approximately 2.84%."
