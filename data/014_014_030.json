    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"I LOVE MATH\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 Playfair grid using the keyword \"MATHS\":\n   M A T H S\n   B C D E F\n   G I K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n   Note that I and J are combined into a single cell.\n\n2. Split the plaintext message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end:\n   IL OV EM AT HX\n\n3. Encrypt each digraph using the Playfair grid:\n   - For IL: I and L are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if needed): K and N. Encrypted digraph: KN\n   - For OV: O and V are in the same column, so replace them with the letters below them (wrap around if needed): P and M. Encrypted digraph: PM\n   - For EM: E and M are in different rows and columns, so replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other letter's column: F and A. Encrypted digraph: FA\n   - For AT: A and T are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if needed): T and H. Encrypted digraph: TH\n   - For HX: H and X are in different rows and columns, so replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other letter's column: S and Y. Encrypted digraph: SY\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message:\n   KNPMFATHSY"
