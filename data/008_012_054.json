    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the inverse matrices method, we first write the given system in matrix form:\n\nAX = B\n\nWhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the matrix of variables, and B is the matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  4 |\n    | 3  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 6 |\n    | 7 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 5) - (4 * 3) = 10 - 12 = -2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nWhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A. The adjugate of A is found by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = |  5 -4 |\n         | -3  2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-2) * |  5 -4 |\n                  | -3  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -5/2  2 |\n          |  3/2 -1 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution matrix X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -5/2  2 | * | 6 |\n    |  3/2 -1 |   | 7 |\n\nX = | (-5/2)*6 + 2*7  |\n    | (3/2)*6 - 1*7    |\n\nX = | -15 + 14 |\n    |  9 - 7   |\n\nX = | -1 |\n    |  2  |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1 and y = 2."
