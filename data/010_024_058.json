    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the formula for the circumference of a circle with radius r in a hyperbolic plane with Gaussian curvature K is given by:\n\nC = 2π sinh(r * sqrt(-K))\n\nGiven that the Gaussian curvature K is -1 and the radius r is 2 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nC = 2π sinh(2 * sqrt(-(-1)))\nC = 2π sinh(2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of sinh(2):\n\nsinh(2) ≈ 3.6269\n\nFinally, we can find the circumference:\n\nC = 2π * 3.6269 ≈ 22.8098 meters\n\nSo, the circumference of a circle with a radius of 2 meters in hyperbolic space is approximately 22.8098 meters."
