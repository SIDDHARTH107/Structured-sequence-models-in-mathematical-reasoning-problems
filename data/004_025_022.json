    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the particle, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time (t). The velocity function is given by v(t) = 2t^2 + 5t - 5.\n\nThe derivative of the velocity function with respect to time is:\n\na(t) = dv(t)/dt = d(2t^2 + 5t - 5)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 4t + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration of the particle after 2 seconds. We can do this by plugging t = 2 into the acceleration function:\n\na(2) = 4(2) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle after 2 seconds is 13 m/sÂ².\n\nTo determine whether the particle is speeding up or slowing down at t = 2 seconds, we need to check the sign of the velocity and acceleration at that moment. If the signs are the same, the particle is speeding up, and if the signs are different, the particle is slowing down.\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity at t = 2 seconds:\n\nv(2) = 2(2)^2 + 5(2) - 5 = 2(4) + 10 - 5 = 8 + 10 - 5 = 13\n\nThe velocity at t = 2 seconds is 13 m/s.\n\nNow, we compare the signs of the velocity and acceleration at t = 2 seconds:\n\nv(2) = 13 (positive)\na(2) = 13 (positive)\n\nSince both the velocity and acceleration are positive at t = 2 seconds, the particle is speeding up at that moment."
