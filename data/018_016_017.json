    "message_2": "To find (A x B) ∪ (B x A), we first need to find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow we find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. Commutativity means that the order of the sets does not matter, so we need to check if (A x B) ∪ (B x A) = (B x A) ∪ (A x B).\n\nSince the union operation is commutative, we can see that:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n(B x A) ∪ (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nBoth sets are equal, so the Cartesian product of two sets is commutative with respect to union."
