    "message_2": "Let's use the formula for the union of two sets: \n\nn(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere n(A ∪ B) represents the total number of students who like either football or cricket or both, n(A) represents the number of students who like only football, n(B) represents the number of students who like only cricket, and n(A ∩ B) represents the number of students who like both football and cricket.\n\nWe are given that 5 students like neither football nor cricket. So, there are 35 - 5 = 30 students who like either football or cricket or both.\n\nWe are also given that 10 students like only football and 15 students like only cricket. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n30 = 10 + 15 - n(A ∩ B)\n\nNow, we can solve for n(A ∩ B):\n\n30 - 25 = n(A ∩ B)\n5 = n(A ∩ B)\n\nSo, 5 students like both football and cricket."
