    "message_2": "To find the equation of an absolute value function that passes through the points (-2, 6) and (4, 2), we will use the general form of an absolute value function:\n\ny = a|x - h| + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the function, and a is a constant that determines the slope of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the vertex (h, k). The vertex is the midpoint of the two given points, so we can find it by averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points:\n\nh = (-2 + 4) / 2 = 1\nk = (6 + 2) / 2 = 4\n\nNow we have the vertex (1, 4), so the equation becomes:\n\ny = a|x - 1| + 4\n\nNext, we need to find the value of a. We can use either of the given points to do this. Let's use the point (-2, 6):\n\n6 = a|-2 - 1| + 4\n6 = a|-3| + 4\n6 = 3a + 4\n\nNow, solve for a:\n\n2 = 3a\na = 2/3\n\nNow we have the value of a, so the equation of the absolute value function is:\n\ny = (2/3)|x - 1| + 4"
