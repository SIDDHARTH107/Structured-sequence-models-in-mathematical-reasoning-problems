    "message_1": "A company needs to select between two investment options. Option A has a 90% chance of earning a profit of £50,000 and a 10% chance of earning a profit of £100,000. Option B has a 60% chance of earning a profit of £80,000 and a 40% chance of earning no profit. What is the expected value of each option and which option should the company choose based on decision theory?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of each option, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then sum the results.\n\nOption A:\nExpected value = (0.9 * £50,000) + (0.1 * £100,000)\nExpected value = (£45,000) + (£10,000)\nExpected value = £55,000\n\nOption B:\nExpected value = (0.6 * £80,000) + (0.4 * £0)\nExpected value = (£48,000) + (£0)\nExpected value = £48,000\n\nBased on decision theory, the company should choose the option with the highest expected value. In this case, Option A has an expected value of £55,000, which is higher than Option B's expected value of £48,000. Therefore, the company should choose Option A."
