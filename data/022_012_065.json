    "message_2": "To find the order of f(z) at z = 1 and z = -3, we need to determine the order of the poles at these points. The order of a pole is the number of times a function can be differentiated before the singularity is removed.\n\nFirst, let's find the order of the pole at z = 1. We can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = $\\frac{e^z}{(z - 1)(z + 3)}$\n\nTo find the order of the pole at z = 1, we can perform a partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = $\\frac{A}{z - 1} + \\frac{B}{z + 3}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z - 1)(z + 3) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n$e^z = A(z + 3) + B(z - 1)$\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in the values of z that make each term zero:\n\nFor z = 1:\n\n$e^1 = A(1 + 3)$\n\n$A = \\frac{e}{4}$\n\nFor z = -3:\n\n$e^{-3} = B(-3 - 1)$\n\n$B = -\\frac{e^{-3}}{4}$\n\nNow, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = $\\frac{\\frac{e}{4}}{z - 1} - \\frac{\\frac{e^{-3}}{4}}{z + 3}$\n\nSince there is a simple pole at z = 1, the order of f(z) at z = 1 is 1.\n\nNext, let's find the order of the pole at z = -3. We already have the partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = $\\frac{\\frac{e}{4}}{z - 1} - \\frac{\\frac{e^{-3}}{4}}{z + 3}$\n\nSince there is a simple pole at z = -3, the order of f(z) at z = -3 is also 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the order of f(z) at z = 1 is 1 and the order of f(z) at z = -3 is 1."
