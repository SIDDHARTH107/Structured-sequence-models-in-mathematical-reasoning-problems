    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the first cohomology group H¹(X, L), we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on X, we have:\n\nh^0(X, D) - h^1(X, D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere h^0(X, D) and h^1(X, D) denote the dimensions of the global sections and first cohomology group of the line bundle associated to D, respectively, deg(D) is the degree of D, and g is the genus of X.\n\nIn our case, D is the divisor associated to the line bundle L, and we are given that deg(D) = d > 2g - 2. We want to compute h^1(X, L) = h^1(X, D).\n\nFirst, we can compute h^0(X, D) using the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh^0(X, D) - h^1(X, D) = d + 1 - g.\n\nNow, we consider the Serre duality theorem, which states that for a smooth projective curve X of genus g and a line bundle L on X,\n\nh^i(X, L) = h^{1-i}(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1)),\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical bundle on X, and ⊗ denotes the tensor product of line bundles.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nh^1(X, L) = h^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1)).\n\nSince deg(K_X) = 2g - 2, we have deg(K_X ⊗ L^(-1)) = (2g - 2) - d < 0.\n\nWhen the degree of a line bundle is negative, it has no global sections. Therefore, h^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1)) = 0, and so h^1(X, L) = 0.\n\nThus, the dimension of the first cohomology group H¹(X, L) is 0."
