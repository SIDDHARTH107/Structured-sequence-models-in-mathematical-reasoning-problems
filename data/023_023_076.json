    "message_2": "Let's denote the original signal as x(t) and the delayed signal as y(t). The delayed signal y(t) can be represented as:\n\ny(t) = x(t - 2)\n\nwhere 2 is the 2-second delay introduced by the device.\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier Transform of y(t). The Fourier Transform of a function x(t) is given by:\n\nX(f) = ∫ x(t) * e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nwhere X(f) is the Fourier Transform of x(t), and f is the frequency variable.\n\nUsing the time-shift property of the Fourier Transform, we know that if x(t) has a Fourier Transform X(f), then the Fourier Transform of x(t - 2) is given by:\n\nY(f) = e^(-j2πf * 2) * X(f)\n\nSince the original signal has a frequency of 100 Hz, it can be represented as:\n\nx(t) = cos(2π * 100 * t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier Transform of x(t):\n\nX(f) = ∫ cos(2π * 100 * t) * e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nThe Fourier Transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nX(f) = π[δ(f - f₀) + δ(f + f₀)]\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function, and f₀ is the frequency of the cosine function (100 Hz in this case).\n\nSo, the Fourier Transform of x(t) is:\n\nX(f) = π[δ(f - 100) + δ(f + 100)]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier Transform of the delayed signal y(t):\n\nY(f) = e^(-j2πf * 2) * X(f)\n\nY(f) = e^(-j4πf) * π[δ(f - 100) + δ(f + 100)]\n\nThis is the Fourier Transform of the signal after passing through the device that introduces a 2-second delay."
