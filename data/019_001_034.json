    "message_2": "Let T represent the proposition \"a customer has tried the product\" and R represent the proposition \"a customer would recommend the product to their friends\". The given statement can be written in propositional logic as:\n\nT → R\n\nwhere → represents the \"implies\" operator.\n\nNow, we are given that 60% of customers who have tried the product would recommend it to their friends. This means that 40% of customers who have tried the product would not recommend it to their friends. In propositional logic, this can be represented as:\n\nT → ¬R\n\nwhere ¬ represents the \"not\" operator.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of customers who have tried the product but would not recommend it to their friends is 40%."
