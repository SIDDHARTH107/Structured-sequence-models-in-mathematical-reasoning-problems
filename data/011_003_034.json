    "message_2": "Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which the first and last number in each row is 1, and each of the other numbers is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It is used to find the coefficients in the binomial expansion and can also be used to find combinations.\n\nTo find the number of different 7-card poker hands that can be formed from a standard deck of 52 cards, we need to find the number of combinations of choosing 7 cards from 52. This can be represented as C(52, 7) or 52 choose 7.\n\nUsing Pascal's Triangle, we can find the value of C(52, 7) by looking at the 53rd row (since the first row is considered the 0th row) and the 7th entry (counting from 0).\n\nHowever, Pascal's Triangle becomes quite large and difficult to work with as we go down the rows. Instead, we can use the formula for combinations derived from Pascal's Triangle:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 52 and k = 7:\n\nC(52, 7) = 52! / (7!(52-7)!)\nC(52, 7) = 52! / (7!45!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials and simplify:\n\n52! = 52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n45! = 45 × 44 × 43 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nC(52, 7) = (52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48 × 47 × 46) / (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\nC(52, 7) = (52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48 × 47 × 46) / (5040)\nC(52, 7) = 133,784,560\n\nSo, there are 133,784,560 different 7-card poker hands that can be formed from a standard deck of 52 cards."
