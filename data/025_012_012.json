    "message_2": "To find the point of order 3 on the elliptic curve E defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 - x over the finite field F_7, we first need to find all the points on the curve.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible x and y values in F_7 and checking if they satisfy the equation. The finite field F_7 has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nHere are the points on the curve E:\n\n(0,0)\n(1,0)\n(2,1), (2,6)\n(3,2), (3,5)\n(4,2), (4,5)\n(5,1), (5,6)\n(6,0)\n\nNow we need to find a point of order 3. This means that when we add the point to itself twice, we should get the point at infinity (the identity element in the group of points on the elliptic curve).\n\nLet's use the following formulas for point addition on elliptic curves:\n\nIf P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2), then the sum R = P + Q = (x3, y3) is given by:\n\nx3 = (λ^2 - x1 - x2) mod 7\ny3 = (λ(x1 - x3) - y1) mod 7\n\nwhere λ = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod 7.\n\nWe can now check each point to see if it has order 3:\n\n- (0,0) is the point at infinity, so it has order 1.\n- (1,0) and (6,0) are points of order 2 since adding them to themselves results in the point at infinity.\n- (2,1) + (2,1) = (5,6) and (2,1) + (5,6) = (2,6), so (2,1) has order 3.\n\nThus, the point of order 3 on the elliptic curve E is (2,1)."
