    "message_2": "To find the probability that exactly 600 students will pass the math exam, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, students passing the exam)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of students who took the exam, which is 800)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of students who passed the exam, which is 600)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a student passing the exam, which is 0.75)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a student not passing the exam, which is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 600) = C(800, 600) * 0.75^600 * 0.25^200\n\nFirst, let's calculate the combinations:\n\nC(800, 600) = 800! / (600! * (800-600)!)\nC(800, 600) = 800! / (600! * 200!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 600) = (800! / (600! * 200!)) * 0.75^600 * 0.25^200\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 600) â‰ˆ 0.0298\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 600 students will pass the math exam is approximately 0.0298 or 2.98%."
