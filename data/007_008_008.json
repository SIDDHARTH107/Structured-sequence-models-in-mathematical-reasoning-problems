    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a such that a is not divisible by p, we have a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nIn this case, p = 7 (which is a prime number) and a = 3 (which is not divisible by 7).\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n3^(7-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n3^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 3^21 is divided by 7. We can rewrite 3^21 as (3^6)^3 * 3^3. Since we know that 3^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can substitute this into the expression:\n\n(1)^3 * 3^3 ≡ 3^3 (mod 7)\n\nNow we just need to find the remainder when 3^3 is divided by 7:\n\n3^3 = 27\n\nAnd the remainder when 27 is divided by 7 is:\n\n27 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the remainder when 3^21 is divided by 7 is 6."
