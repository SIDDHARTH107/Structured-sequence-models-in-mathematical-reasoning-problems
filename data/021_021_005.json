    "message_1": "A company has three factories to produce a certain product. The daily production costs for each of the factories are as follows: Factory 1 costs $3000, Factory 2 costs $2500 and Factory 3 costs $2800. The company requires a daily production of 500 units of the product. Factory 1 can produce a maximum of 250 units, Factory 2 can produce a maximum of 150 units, and Factory 3 can produce a maximum of 200 units. How many units of the product should be produced at each factory to minimize the total production cost? Solve this problem using cuckoo search algorithm.",
    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute code or algorithms directly. However, I can help you understand how to implement the cuckoo search algorithm to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Define the objective function: In this case, the objective function is the total production cost, which needs to be minimized. The function can be represented as:\n\nf(x) = 3000 * x1 + 2500 * x2 + 2800 * x3\n\nwhere x1, x2, and x3 are the number of units produced by Factory 1, Factory 2, and Factory 3, respectively.\n\n2. Define the constraints: The constraints are the maximum production capacities of each factory and the required daily production:\n\nx1 <= 250\nx2 <= 150\nx3 <= 200\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 500\n\n3. Initialize the cuckoo search algorithm: Set the parameters for the algorithm, such as the number of nests (population size), the probability of discovering an alien egg (pa), and the step size (alpha). Initialize the population randomly within the feasible search space.\n\n4. Evaluate the fitness of each nest: Calculate the objective function value for each nest (solution) and rank them based on their fitness.\n\n5. Perform the Levy flight: Update the position of each cuckoo by performing a random walk with Levy flight distribution. Make sure the new positions satisfy the constraints.\n\n6. Replace the worst nest: If the new position of a cuckoo has better fitness than the worst nest, replace the worst nest with the new position.\n\n7. Perform the local search: With probability pa, choose a random nest and replace it with a new solution generated by local search within the feasible search space.\n\n8. Check the termination criteria: Repeat steps 4-7 until a predefined number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy is reached.\n\n9. Return the best solution: The best nest represents the optimal number of units to be produced at each factory to minimize the total production cost.\n\nAfter implementing the cuckoo search algorithm, you will obtain the optimal number of units to be produced at each factory to minimize the total production cost."
