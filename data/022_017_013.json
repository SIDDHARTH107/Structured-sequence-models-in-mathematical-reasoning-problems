    "message_2": "To solve the given complex differential equation, we first find the characteristic equation associated with the homogeneous differential equation:\n\n$$r^2 + 3r + 2 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for r:\n\n$$r = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 2}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2}$$\n\nSo we have two distinct real roots:\n\n$$r_1 = -1, \\quad r_2 = -2$$\n\nThe general solution for the homogeneous differential equation is given by:\n\n$$z(t) = c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-2t}$$\n\nNow we need to find the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ using the initial conditions:\n\n1) $z(0) = 1$\n\n$$1 = c_1 e^{0} + c_2 e^{0} \\Rightarrow 1 = c_1 + c_2$$\n\n2) $z'(0) = -2$\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of $z(t)$:\n\n$$z'(t) = -c_1 e^{-t} - 2c_2 e^{-2t}$$\n\nNow we use the initial condition:\n\n$$-2 = -c_1 e^{0} - 2c_2 e^{0} \\Rightarrow -2 = -c_1 - 2c_2$$\n\nWe have a system of linear equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nc_1 + c_2 = 1 \\\\\n-c_1 - 2c_2 = -2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSolving this system, we find:\n\n$$c_1 = 2, \\quad c_2 = -1$$\n\nSo the particular solution for the given initial conditions is:\n\n$$z(t) = 2e^{-t} - e^{-2t}$$\n\nThis is the solution for $z(t)$ in the interval $t \\in [0, 2]$."
