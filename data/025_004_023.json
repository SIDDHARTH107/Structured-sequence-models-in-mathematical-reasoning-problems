    "message_2": "To find the degree of the rational curve parameterized by $C(t) = (\\frac{t^2+1}{t^3-t},\\frac{t^3+t}{t^3-t})$, we first need to homogenize the curve. To do this, we introduce a new variable $z$ and multiply the numerators and denominators of the rational functions by the appropriate powers of $z$ to make them homogeneous polynomials of the same degree.\n\nThe homogeneous version of $C(t)$ is given by $C(t, z) = (\\frac{(t^2+1)z}{t^3-tz^2},\\frac{(t^3+t)z^2}{t^3-tz^2}, z)$. Now, we want to eliminate the parameter $t$ to obtain an equation in $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\nLet $x = \\frac{(t^2+1)z}{t^3-tz^2}$, $y = \\frac{(t^3+t)z^2}{t^3-tz^2}$, and $w = z$. Then we have:\n\n1) $x(t^3-tz^2) = (t^2+1)z$\n2) $y(t^3-tz^2) = (t^3+t)z^2$\n\nNow, we can eliminate $z$ by dividing equation 2 by equation 1:\n\n$\\frac{y(t^3-tz^2)}{x(t^3-tz^2)} = \\frac{(t^3+t)z^2}{(t^2+1)z}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$y(t^2+1) = x(t^3+t)$\n\nExpanding and rearranging, we obtain the equation:\n\n$yt^2 + y = xt^3 + xt$\n\nNow, we can eliminate $t$ by computing the resultant of the polynomials with respect to $t$. The resultant of two polynomials is an algebraic expression that is zero if and only if the polynomials have a common root. In our case, the resultant will be a polynomial in $x$, $y$, and $z$ that defines the curve in the projective plane.\n\nLet $f(t) = yt^2 + y - xt^3 - xt$ and $g(t) = t^3 - tz^2$. The resultant of $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ with respect to $t$ is given by:\n\n$R(f, g) = \\begin{vmatrix}\ny & 0 & -x & 0 \\\\\n0 & y & -x & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & y & -x \\\\\n1 & -z^2 & 0 & 0\n\\end{vmatrix}$\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n$R(f, g) = y^3 - x^3z^2$\n\nThis is the equation of the curve in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$. The degree of the curve is the highest total degree of its terms, which in this case is 3. Therefore, the degree of the rational curve parameterized by $C(t) = (\\frac{t^2+1}{t^3-t},\\frac{t^3+t}{t^3-t})$ in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is 3."
