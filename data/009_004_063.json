    "message_1": "A spring-mass system has a mass of 2 kg and a spring constant of 100 N/m. It is initially at rest and is displaced 4 cm from its equilibrium position. If there is no damping, find the frequency of vibration and the amplitude of motion.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of vibration, we can use the formula for the angular frequency (ω) of a spring-mass system:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (100 N/m) and m is the mass (2 kg).\n\nω = √(100/2) = √50 = 5√2 rad/s\n\nNow, we can find the frequency of vibration (f) using the relation between angular frequency and frequency:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\n\nf = (5√2) / (2π) ≈ 1.118 Hz\n\nThe amplitude of motion is simply the initial displacement from the equilibrium position, which is given as 4 cm. To express this in meters, we can convert it as follows:\n\nAmplitude = 4 cm * (1 m / 100 cm) = 0.04 m\n\nSo, the frequency of vibration is approximately 1.118 Hz, and the amplitude of motion is 0.04 m."
