Suppose we want to design a control u(t) to minimize the following cost function:\n\nJ(u) = ∫[0,1] (y(t) - r(t))^2 dt\n\nwhere r(t) is the reference signal we want the system to track. Assume that the initial conditions are y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0, and the reference signal is given by r(t) = sin(2πt).\n\nDetermine the optimal control u*(t) that minimizes the cost function J(u), and the corresponding minimum value of the cost function.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we need to form the Hamiltonian function H, which is given by:\n\nH = L + λ'(t) * f\n\nwhere L is the Lagrangian, λ(t) is the costate variable, and f is the system dynamics. In our case, L = (y(t) - r(t))^2 and f = y'' + 2y' + 5y - u(t).\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations:\n\nλ'(t) = -∂H/∂y\nλ''(t) = -∂H/∂y'\n\nFrom the given system dynamics, we have:\n\ny'' = u(t) - 2y' - 5y\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives of H:\n\n∂H/∂y = 2(y(t) - r(t))\n∂H/∂y' = 0\n\nUsing the costate equations, we get:\n\nλ'(t) = -2(y(t) - r(t))\nλ''(t) = 0\n\nSince λ''(t) = 0, we have λ'(t) = c1, where c1 is a constant. Integrating λ'(t) with respect to t, we get:\n\nλ(t) = c1*t + c2\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal control u*(t) that minimizes the Hamiltonian H. To do this, we take the partial derivative of H with respect to u and set it equal to 0:\n\n∂H/∂u = -λ'(t) + u(t) - 2y' - 5y = 0\n\nSubstituting λ'(t) = -2(y(t) - r(t)), we get:\n\nu*(t) = 2(y(t) - r(t)) + 2y' + 5y\n\nNow, we have a second-order differential equation for y(t):\n\ny'' = 2(y(t) - r(t)) + 2y' + 5y - 2y' - 5y\ny'' = 2(y(t) - sin(2πt))\n\nwith initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0.\n\nSolving this differential equation, we get:\n\ny(t) = (1/2π^2) * (sin(2πt) - 2πt*cos(2πt) - 2πt)\n\nNow, we can find the optimal control u*(t):\n\nu*(t) = 2((1/2π^2) * (sin(2πt) - 2πt*cos(2πt) - 2πt) - sin(2πt)) + 2(1/2π) * (cos(2πt) - 1) + 5(1/2π^2) * (sin(2πt) - 2πt*cos(2πt) - 2πt)\n\nFinally, we can find the minimum value of the cost function J(u*) by substituting y(t) and u*(t) into the cost function and integrating over the interval [0, 1]:\n\nJ(u*) = ∫[0,1] ((1/2π^2) * (sin(2πt) - 2πt*cos(2πt) - 2πt) - sin(2πt))^2 dt\n\nEvaluating this integral, we get:\n\nJ(u*) ≈ 0.0197\n\nSo, the optimal control u*(t) that minimizes the cost function J(u) is:\n\nu*(t) = 2((1/2π^2) * (sin(2πt) - 2πt*cos(2πt) - 2πt) - sin(2πt)) + 2(1/2π) * (cos(2πt) - 1) + 5(1/2π^2) * (sin(2πt) - 2πt*cos(2πt) - 2πt)\n\nand the corresponding minimum value of the cost function is J(u*) ≈ 0.0197."
