    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In the given graph, we can see that the maximum degree (Δ) of any vertex is 3.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index (χ') of a graph G is either equal to the maximum degree (Δ) or Δ + 1. So, the chromatic index of this graph will be either 3 or 4.\n\nBy trying to color the edges of the graph, we can find a valid edge coloring using 3 colors:\n\n1. Color the top horizontal edge with color 1.\n2. Color the left diagonal edge with color 2.\n3. Color the right diagonal edge with color 3.\n4. Color the bottom horizontal edge with color 1.\n5. Color the left vertical edge with color 3.\n6. Color the right vertical edge with color 2.\n\nSince we found a valid edge coloring using 3 colors, the chromatic index of this graph is 3."
