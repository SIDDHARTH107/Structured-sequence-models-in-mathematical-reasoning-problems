    "message_2": "To find the expected number of employees who will commit financial fraud, we can multiply the total number of employees by the probability of an employee committing financial fraud.\n\nExpected number of employees committing financial fraud = Total number of employees × Probability of committing financial fraud\n\nExpected number of employees committing financial fraud = 200 × 0.08\n\nExpected number of employees committing financial fraud = 16\n\nSo, the expected number of employees who will commit financial fraud is 16."
