    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length of 12 cm each and a base of 9 cm. Find the length of the altitude from the vertex to the base.",
    "message_2": "Let's call the isosceles triangle ABC, with A being the vertex, and B and C being the base angles. Let D be the point on the base BC where the altitude AD is drawn. Since AD is perpendicular to BC, triangle ABD is a right triangle.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude AD. In right triangle ABD, we have:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles, the altitude bisects the base, so BD = BC/2 = 9/2 = 4.5 cm.\n\nNow we can plug in the values and solve for AD:\n\n(12)^2 = AD^2 + (4.5)^2\n144 = AD^2 + 20.25\nAD^2 = 123.75\nAD = √123.75\nAD ≈ 11.12 cm\n\nSo, the length of the altitude from the vertex to the base is approximately 11.12 cm."
