    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)Y(y)\\frac{dT}{dt} = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $$\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda^2 T(t)$$\n2. $$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\n3. $$Y''(y) + \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for the second and third equations are:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n$$Y(y) = C\\cos(\\lambda y) + D\\sin(\\lambda y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(x,0,t) = u(x,1,t) = u(0,y,t) = u(1,y,t) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$X(0) = A = 0$$\n$$X(1) = B\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$$\n$$Y(0) = C = 0$$\n$$Y(1) = D\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$$\n\nSince $B$ and $D$ are nonzero, we must have $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, the solution takes the form:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} A_{nm}\\sin(n\\pi x)\\sin(m\\pi y)T_{nm}(t)$$\n\nNow we need to find the coefficients $A_{nm}$ and the function $T_{nm}(t)$. From the initial condition, we have:\n\n$$u(x,y,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} A_{nm}\\sin(n\\pi x)\\sin(m\\pi y)$$\n\nComparing the two sides, we can see that $A_{11} = 1$ and all other $A_{nm} = 0$. Thus, the solution simplifies to:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)T_{11}(t)$$\n\nNow we need to find $T_{11}(t)$. From the first ordinary differential equation, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{dT_{11}}{dt} = -\\lambda^2 T_{11}(t) = -\\pi^2 T_{11}(t)$$\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\n$$T_{11}(t) = Ce^{-\\pi^2 t}$$\n\nSince $T_{11}(0) = 1$, we have $C = 1$. Thus, the solution for $u(x,y,t)$ is:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)e^{-\\pi^2 t}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the solution at $t = 1$:\n\n$$u(x,y,1) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)e^{-\\pi^2}$$"
