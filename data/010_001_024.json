    "message_2": "To show that there exist two open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅, we will use the fact that A and B are closed subsets of X.\n\nSince A and B are closed subsets of X, their complements, X \\ A and X \\ B, are open subsets of X. Now, let's define the open sets U and V as follows:\n\nU = X \\ B\nV = X \\ A\n\nClearly, A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V, because A is contained in the complement of B, and B is contained in the complement of A.\n\nNow, we need to show that U ∩ V = ∅. Suppose there exists an element x ∈ U ∩ V. Then, x ∈ U and x ∈ V. Since x ∈ U, x ∉ B. Similarly, since x ∈ V, x ∉ A. But this contradicts the fact that A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X, because x should belong to either A or B. Therefore, U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nNow, let's use this result to prove that the one-point sets {x} and {y} are closed in X if and only if x ≠ y.\n\n(⇒) Suppose {x} and {y} are closed in X. Then, by the result we just proved, there exist open sets U and V such that {x} ⊆ U, {y} ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. Since x ∈ U and y ∈ V, x cannot be equal to y, because if x = y, then U ∩ V would be non-empty, which contradicts the fact that U ∩ V = ∅. Therefore, x ≠ y.\n\n(⇐) Suppose x ≠ y. Then, {x} and {y} are disjoint closed subsets of X. By the result we just proved, there exist open sets U and V such that {x} ⊆ U, {y} ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. Since {x} ⊆ U and {y} ⊆ V, the complements X \\ {x} and X \\ {y} are closed in X. Therefore, the one-point sets {x} and {y} are closed in X.\n\nThus, we have shown that the one-point sets {x} and {y} are closed in X if and only if x ≠ y."
