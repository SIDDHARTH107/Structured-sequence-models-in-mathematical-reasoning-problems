    "message_2": "Given that the volume of the cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t to find the rate at which the water level is rising.\n\ndV/dt = πr²(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that the radius r = 10 cm, and the rate at which the volume is increasing is dV/dt = 5 cm³/s. We want to find the rate at which the height is increasing (dh/dt) when the height h = 2 cm.\n\n5 = π(10)²(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = 5 / (π(10)²)\ndh/dt = 5 / (100π)\ndh/dt ≈ 0.0159 cm/s\n\nSo, when the water level is 2 cm high, it is rising at a rate of approximately 0.0159 cm/s."
