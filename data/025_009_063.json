    "message_2": "The dimension of the moduli space $M_g$ of smooth projective curves of genus $g$ can be computed using the formula:\n\ndim($M_g$) = 3g - 3\n\nIn this case, we have $g = 5$, so the dimension of $M_5$ is:\n\ndim($M_5$) = 3(5) - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12\n\nThus, the dimension of $M_5$ is 12."
