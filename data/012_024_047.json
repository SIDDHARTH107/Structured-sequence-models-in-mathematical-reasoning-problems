    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required on a surface to embed the graph without any edge crossings. To determine the genus of the complete bipartite graph K(3,5), we can use the formula for the genus of a bipartite graph:\n\ng = (|E| - (|V| - n + 1))/2n,\n\nwhere g is the genus, |E| is the number of edges, |V| is the number of vertices, and n is the maximum of the two parts in the bipartition.\n\nFor K(3,5), we have 3 vertices in one part and 5 vertices in the other part. Thus, n = max(3,5) = 5. The number of edges in a complete bipartite graph K(a,b) is given by |E| = a * b. In this case, |E| = 3 * 5 = 15. The number of vertices is |V| = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ng = (15 - (8 - 5 + 1))/(2*5)\ng = (15 - 4)/10\ng = 11/10\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer:\n\ng = 2\n\nTherefore, the genus of the complete bipartite graph K(3,5) is 2."
