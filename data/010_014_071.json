    "message_2": "To calculate the cohomology groups of a closed orientable surface of genus 2, we can use the fact that it is a connected sum of two tori. Let's denote this surface as M. Then, M can be represented as the connected sum of two tori, T_1 and T_2, i.e., M = T_1 # T_2.\n\nNow, let's recall the cohomology groups of a torus T. Using the universal coefficient theorem, we have:\n\nH^0(T; Z) = Z\nH^1(T; Z) = Z^2\nH^2(T; Z) = Z\n\nNow, we can use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the cohomology groups of the connected sum M = T_1 # T_2. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence for cohomology groups is:\n\n... -> H^k(M; Z) -> H^k(T_1; Z) ⊕ H^k(T_2; Z) -> H^k(S^1; Z) -> H^{k+1}(M; Z) -> ...\n\nWe will compute the cohomology groups H^1(M; Z) and H^2(M; Z) using this sequence.\n\nFor k = 0, the sequence becomes:\n\n... -> H^0(M; Z) -> H^0(T_1; Z) ⊕ H^0(T_2; Z) -> H^0(S^1; Z) -> H^1(M; Z) -> ...\n\nSince H^0(T_1; Z) = H^0(T_2; Z) = H^0(S^1; Z) = Z, we have:\n\nZ -> H^0(M; Z) -> Z ⊕ Z -> Z -> H^1(M; Z) -> ...\n\nFrom this sequence, we can deduce that H^0(M; Z) = Z and H^1(M; Z) = Z^4.\n\nFor k = 1, the sequence becomes:\n\n... -> H^1(M; Z) -> H^1(T_1; Z) ⊕ H^1(T_2; Z) -> H^1(S^1; Z) -> H^2(M; Z) -> ...\n\nSince H^1(T_1; Z) = H^1(T_2; Z) = Z^2 and H^1(S^1; Z) = Z, we have:\n\nZ^4 -> H^1(M; Z) -> Z^2 ⊕ Z^2 -> Z -> H^2(M; Z) -> ...\n\nFrom this sequence, we can deduce that H^2(M; Z) = Z.\n\nThus, the cohomology groups of a closed orientable surface of genus 2 with coefficients in the integers are:\n\nH^0(M; Z) = Z\nH^1(M; Z) = Z^4\nH^2(M; Z) = Z"
