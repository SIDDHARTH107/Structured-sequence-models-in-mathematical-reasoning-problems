    "message_1": "Suppose a driver has to choose between two car insurance policies - Policy A and Policy B. Policy A costs $500 per year and covers all damages from accidents. Policy B costs $200 per year but has a $1000 deductible, meaning the driver must pay the first $1000 of any damages before the insurance kicks in. However, Policy B also provides a 10% discount on yearly premiums for drivers who do not make any claims that year. \nAssuming the driver's expected annual loss from accidents is $700, which policy should they choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which policy the driver should choose, we need to compare the expected annual costs of both policies.\n\nFor Policy A, the cost is straightforward: $500 per year.\n\nFor Policy B, we need to consider two scenarios: when the driver makes a claim and when the driver does not make a claim.\n\nLet's assume the probability of having an accident in a year is p, and the probability of not having an accident is (1-p). Since the expected annual loss from accidents is $700, we can set up the following equation:\n\np * $1000 + (1-p) * $0 = $700\n\nSolving for p, we get:\n\np = 0.7\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected annual cost of Policy B:\n\n1. When the driver makes a claim (probability = 0.7):\n   - The driver pays the $1000 deductible.\n   - The driver pays the full premium of $200.\n   - Total cost in this scenario: $1000 + $200 = $1200\n\n2. When the driver does not make a claim (probability = 0.3):\n   - The driver pays $0 for damages.\n   - The driver gets a 10% discount on the premium, so they pay $200 * 0.9 = $180.\n   - Total cost in this scenario: $0 + $180 = $180\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected annual cost of Policy B:\n\nExpected cost of Policy B = (0.7 * $1200) + (0.3 * $180) = $840 + $54 = $894\n\nComparing the expected annual costs of both policies:\n\nPolicy A: $500\nPolicy B: $894\n\nThe driver should choose Policy A, as it has a lower expected annual cost."
