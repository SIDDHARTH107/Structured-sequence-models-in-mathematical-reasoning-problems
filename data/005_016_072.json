The mean and standard deviation of each variable for both groups are given in the following table:\n\nVariable | Mean (Group A) | SD (Group A) | Mean (Group B) | SD (Group B)\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nX1 | 10 | 2 | 12 | 3\nX2 | 7 | 1.5 | 7.5 | 2\nX3 | 20 | 5 | 22 | 6\nX4 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 1.2\nX5 | 12 | 2.5 | 10 | 2\nX6 | 8 | 2 | 6 | 1.5\nX7 | 16 | 3 | 14 | 4\n\nAssuming that you want to predict which group a new student belongs to based on the values of these seven variables, use discriminant analysis to classify a new student with the following measurements:\n\nX1 = 8, X2 = 6, X3 = 19, X4 = 3, X5 = 14, X6 = 10, X7 = 15\n\nWhich group is the new student likely to belong to?",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we first need to calculate the discriminant function for each group. The discriminant function is given by:\n\nD = (X - M)' * Σ^(-1) * (X - M)\n\nwhere X is the vector of the new student's measurements, M is the vector of the group means, and Σ^(-1) is the inverse of the covariance matrix. Since we don't have the covariance matrix, we will assume that the variables are uncorrelated, and the covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix with the standard deviations squared on the diagonal.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the inverse of the covariance matrix. Since the variables are uncorrelated, the inverse of the covariance matrix is also a diagonal matrix with the reciprocals of the standard deviations squared on the diagonal.\n\nΣ^(-1) (Group A) = diag(1/4, 1/2.25, 1/25, 1, 1/6.25, 1/4, 1/9)\nΣ^(-1) (Group B) = diag(1/9, 1/4, 1/36, 1/1.44, 1/4, 1/2.25, 1/16)\n\nNext, let's calculate the difference between the new student's measurements and the group means:\n\nX - M (Group A) = (8 - 10, 6 - 7, 19 - 20, 3 - 4, 14 - 12, 10 - 8, 15 - 16) = (-2, -1, -1, -1, 2, 2, -1)\nX - M (Group B) = (8 - 12, 6 - 7.5, 19 - 22, 3 - 4, 14 - 10, 10 - 6, 15 - 14) = (-4, -1.5, -3, -1, 4, 4, 1)\n\nNow, let's calculate the discriminant function for each group:\n\nD (Group A) = (-2, -1, -1, -1, 2, 2, -1) * Σ^(-1) (Group A) * (-2, -1, -1, -1, 2, 2, -1)'\nD (Group A) = (-1, -0.444, -0.04, -1, 0.32, 1, -0.111) * (-2, -1, -1, -1, 2, 2, -1)'\nD (Group A) = -1*(-2) - 0.444*(-1) - 0.04*(-1) - 1*(-1) + 0.32*2 + 1*2 - 0.111*(-1)\nD (Group A) = 2 + 0.444 + 0.04 + 1 + 0.64 + 2 + 0.111\nD (Group A) = 6.235\n\nD (Group B) = (-4, -1.5, -3, -1, 4, 4, 1) * Σ^(-1) (Group B) * (-4, -1.5, -3, -1, 4, 4, 1)'\nD (Group B) = (-1.778, -0.375, -0.333, -0.694, 1, 1.778, 0.0625) * (-4, -1.5, -3, -1, 4, 4, 1)'\nD (Group B) = -1.778*(-4) - 0.375*(-1.5) - 0.333*(-3) - 0.694*(-1) + 1*4 + 1.778*4 + 0.0625*1\nD (Group B) = 7.112 + 0.5625 + 0.999 + 0.694 + 4 + 7.112 + 0.0625\nD (Group B) = 20.542\n\nSince D (Group A) < D (Group B), the new student is more likely to belong to Group B."
