    "message_2": "To find the year when the company experienced a change in its profit trend, we need to find the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1. The inflection point is the point on the curve where the concavity changes. To find this, we need to find the second derivative of the function and set it equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection point, set the second derivative equal to zero:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, the company experienced a change in its profit trend at the end of the second year since its inception."
