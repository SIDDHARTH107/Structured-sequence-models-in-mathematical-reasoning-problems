    "message_2": "To find the key matrix, we first need to convert the plaintext and ciphertext into numerical form using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n\nPlaintext (CAT):\nC = 2\nA = 0\nT = 19\n\nCiphertext (OQN):\nO = 14\nQ = 16\nN = 13\n\nNow, we arrange the plaintext and ciphertext into 2x1 column matrices:\n\nP = |  2  |\n    |  0  |\n\nC = | 19  |\n\nE = | 14  |\n    | 16  |\n\nNow, we know that the Hill cipher encryption process is given by the formula:\n\nE = K * P (mod 26)\n\nWhere K is the 2x2 key matrix. To find K, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse of P (mod 26):\n\nK = E * P^(-1) (mod 26)\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of P (mod 26). The 2x2 matrix P has the form:\n\nP = |  2  0 |\n    | 19  1 |\n\nThe determinant of P is:\n\ndet(P) = (2 * 1) - (0 * 19) = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of the determinant (mod 26). In this case, the modular inverse of 2 (mod 26) is 13, since (2 * 13) % 26 = 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the adjugate of P:\n\nadj(P) = |  1 -19 |\n         |  0   2 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of P (mod 26) by multiplying the adjugate of P by the modular inverse of the determinant:\n\nP^(-1) = 13 * adj(P) (mod 26)\n\nP^(-1) = | 13 -1 |\n         |  0 26 |\n\nP^(-1) = | 13 25 |\n         |  0  0 |\n\nNow, we can find the key matrix K:\n\nK = E * P^(-1) (mod 26)\n\nK = | 14 16 | * | 13 25 | (mod 26)\n    | 13  0 |\n\nK = | (14*13 + 16*0) % 26  (14*25 + 16*0) % 26 |\n    | (13*13 + 0*0) % 26    (13*25 + 0*0) % 26 |\n\nK = | 4  6 |\n    | 3  7 |\n\nSo, the key matrix used for encryption is:\n\nK = | 4  6 |\n    | 3  7 |"
