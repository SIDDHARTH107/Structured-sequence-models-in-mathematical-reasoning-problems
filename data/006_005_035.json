    "message_1": "A math student is conducting a study on the probability of a certain event occurring during a 10-day period. Based on past data, the student knows that the probability of the event occurring on any given day is 0.4. What is the probability that the event will occur at least once during the 10-day period?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the event occurring at least once during the 10-day period, we can first find the probability of the event not occurring at all during the 10 days and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of the event not occurring on any given day is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nThe probability of the event not occurring for all 10 days is (0.6)^10.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of the event occurring at least once by subtracting the probability of it not occurring at all from 1:\n\nP(at least one occurrence) = 1 - P(no occurrences) = 1 - (0.6)^10 ≈ 1 - 0.0060466176 ≈ 0.9939533824.\n\nSo, the probability of the event occurring at least once during the 10-day period is approximately 0.9939533824 or 99.4%."
