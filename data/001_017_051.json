    "message_2": "To solve the equation log5(x-3) + log5(x+3) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation using the product rule of logarithms, which states that logb(m) + logb(n) = logb(mn):\n\nlog5((x-3)(x+3)) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n5^2 = (x-3)(x+3)\n\n25 = x^2 - 3x + 3x - 9\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 9 = 25\n\nx^2 = 34\n\nTo solve for x, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nx = ±√34\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = √34 and x = -√34."
