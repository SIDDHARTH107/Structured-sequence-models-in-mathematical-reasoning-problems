    "message_2": "To solve the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation using the spectral method with the first 128 Fourier modes, we first need to express the initial condition $u(x,0)$ in terms of its Fourier series representation. \n\nLet $u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=-128}^{128} c_n \\mathrm{e}^{ik_nx}$, where $k_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{L}$ and $L$ is the period of the function. Since the initial condition is an even function, we only need to consider the cosine terms in the Fourier series. Thus, we have:\n\n$u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{128} c_n \\cos(k_nx)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients $c_n$. Using the definition of the Fourier cosine series, we have:\n\n$c_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} u(x,0) \\cos(k_nx) dx$.\n\nFor the given initial condition, $u(x,0) = 2\\text{ sech}(2x)$, we can compute the coefficients $c_n$ numerically using integration techniques such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.\n\nOnce we have the coefficients $c_n$, we can express the solution $u(x,t)$ as:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{128} c_n \\cos(k_nx) \\mathrm{e}^{-ik_n^2t}$.\n\nThis is the solution to the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation for $t \\geq 0$ using the spectral method with the first 128 Fourier modes. Note that this solution is an approximation, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the number of Fourier modes used."
