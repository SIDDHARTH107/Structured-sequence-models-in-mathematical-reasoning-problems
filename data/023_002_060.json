    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the given periodic function, we first need to determine the period of the function. Since the function is defined over the interval -1 < x < 3, the period is T = 4.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(n * ω * x) + bn * sin(n * ω * x)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π / T, an and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients an and bn, we use the following formulas:\n\nan = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * ω * x) dx] over one period\nbn = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * ω * x) dx] over one period\n\nFor a0, we have:\n\na0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) dx] over one period\n\nLet's calculate the coefficients:\n\na0 = (1/4) * [∫[-1, 1] 1 dx + ∫[1, 3] -3 dx]\na0 = (1/4) * [2 - 6] = -1\n\nan = (2/4) * [∫[-1, 1] 1 * cos(n * ω * x) dx + ∫[1, 3] -3 * cos(n * ω * x) dx]\nan = (1/2) * [∫[-1, 1] cos(n * ω * x) dx - 3 * ∫[1, 3] cos(n * ω * x) dx]\n\nIntegrating and simplifying, we get:\n\nan = (1/2) * [(2/nπ) * sin(n * ω * x) |[-1, 1] - (6/nπ) * sin(n * ω * x) |[1, 3]]\nan = (1/nπ) * [sin(n * ω) - sin(-n * ω) - 3 * (sin(3 * n * ω) - sin(n * ω))]\nan = (2/nπ) * [1 - cos(n * π) - 3 * (cos(3 * n * π) - 1)]\n\nbn = (2/4) * [∫[-1, 1] 1 * sin(n * ω * x) dx + ∫[1, 3] -3 * sin(n * ω * x) dx]\nbn = (1/2) * [∫[-1, 1] sin(n * ω * x) dx - 3 * ∫[1, 3] sin(n * ω * x) dx]\n\nIntegrating and simplifying, we get:\n\nbn = (1/2) * [(-2/nπ) * cos(n * ω * x) |[-1, 1] + (6/nπ) * cos(n * ω * x) |[1, 3]]\nbn = (-1/nπ) * [cos(n * ω) - cos(-n * ω) + 3 * (cos(3 * n * ω) - cos(n * ω))]\nbn = (-2/nπ) * [cos(n * π) - 1 + 3 * (cos(3 * n * π) - cos(n * π))]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = -1 + Σ[((2/nπ) * [1 - cos(n * π) - 3 * (cos(3 * n * π) - 1)] * cos(n * ω * x) - (2/nπ) * [cos(n * π) - 1 + 3 * (cos(3 * n * π) - cos(n * π))] * sin(n * ω * x)]\n\nTo determine whether the series converges at x = 1 and x = 3, we need to check the continuity and differentiability of the function at these points.\n\nAt x = 1, the function is continuous but not differentiable, as there is a jump in the derivative. At x = 3, the function is continuous and differentiable, as it is periodic and the derivative is continuous at x = -1.\n\nAccording to the Dirichlet's conditions for the convergence of a Fourier series, the series converges at a point if the function is continuous and has a finite number of discontinuities in its derivatives within one period. \n\nTherefore, the Fourier series converges at x = 3 but not at x = 1."
