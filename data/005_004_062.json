In order to determine if there is a significant difference in the lifespan of the batteries, a random sample of each brand is taken and their lifespans are recorded. The data is shown below:\n\nBrand A: 1200, 1400, 1300, 1500, 1250\nBrand B: 1150, 1400, 1350, 1200, 1300\nBrand C: 1300, 1100, 1350, 1400, 1200\n\nDetermine whether there is a significant difference in the lifespan of the three battery brands at a significance level of 0.05 using ANOVA.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the lifespan of the three battery brands, we will perform a one-way ANOVA test. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the means of each group and the overall mean.\n\nBrand A mean (M_A) = (1200 + 1400 + 1300 + 1500 + 1250) / 5 = 6650 / 5 = 1330\nBrand B mean (M_B) = (1150 + 1400 + 1350 + 1200 + 1300) / 5 = 6400 / 5 = 1280\nBrand C mean (M_C) = (1300 + 1100 + 1350 + 1400 + 1200) / 5 = 6350 / 5 = 1270\n\nOverall mean (M_T) = (6650 + 6400 + 6350) / 15 = 19400 / 15 = 1293.33\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and total sum of squares (SST).\n\nSSB = Σn_i(M_i - M_T)^2\nSSB = 5(1330 - 1293.33)^2 + 5(1280 - 1293.33)^2 + 5(1270 - 1293.33)^2\nSSB = 5(36.67^2) + 5(-13.33^2) + 5(-23.33^2) = 5(1344.44) + 5(177.77) + 5(543.44) = 6722.22 + 888.85 + 2717.22 = 10328.29\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - M_i)^2\nSSW = (1200-1330)^2 + (1400-1330)^2 + ... + (1200-1270)^2\nSSW = 16900 + 4900 + 900 + 28900 + 6400 + 16900 + 4900 + 900 + 16900 + 4900\nSSW = 16900 + 4900 + 900 + 28900 + 6400 + 16900 + 4900 + 900 + 16900 + 4900 = 68400\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 10328.29 + 68400 = 78728.29\n\nStep 3: Calculate the degrees of freedom for each sum of squares.\n\ndf_SSB = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\ndf_SSW = N - k = 15 - 3 = 12\ndf_SST = N - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14\n\nStep 4: Calculate the mean squares for each sum of squares.\n\nMSB = SSB / df_SSB = 10328.29 / 2 = 5164.14\nMSW = SSW / df_SSW = 68400 / 12 = 5700\n\nStep 5: Calculate the F-statistic.\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 5164.14 / 5700 = 0.906\n\nStep 6: Determine the critical F-value at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nUsing an F-distribution table, we find the critical F-value for df_SSB = 2 and df_SSW = 12 at a significance level of 0.05 is approximately 3.89.\n\nStep 7: Compare the F-statistic to the critical F-value.\n\nSince the F-statistic (0.906) is less than the critical F-value (3.89), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. \n\nConclusion:\nAt a significance level of 0.05, there is no significant difference in the lifespan of the three battery brands."
