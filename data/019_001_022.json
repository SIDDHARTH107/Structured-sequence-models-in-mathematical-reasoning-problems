    "message_2": "The compound statement \"I will get an A on the exam if and only if I study for three hours every day\" can be written as a logical expression using the biconditional operator, which is represented by the symbol \"↔\". The biconditional operator means that both p → q (if p, then q) and q → p (if q, then p) are true. So, the logical expression for the given compound statement is:\n\np ↔ q"
