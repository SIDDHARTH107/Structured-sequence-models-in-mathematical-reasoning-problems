    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. We are looking for the smallest Sophie Germain prime that can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares.\n\nLet's start by listing the first few Sophie Germain primes: 2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, 41, ...\n\nNow, let's check if any of these can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares:\n\n2 = 1^2 + 1^2\n3 = Not possible\n5 = Not possible\n11 = Not possible\n23 = Not possible\n29 = 2^2 + 5^2 (4 + 25 = 29)\n\nSo, the smallest Sophie Germain prime that can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares is 29."
