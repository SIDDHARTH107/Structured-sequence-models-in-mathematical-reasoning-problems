    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 > 7, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality:\n   2x + 3 - 3 > 7 - 3\n   2x > 4\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n   2x/2 > 4/2\n   x > 2\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x > 2.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from -2 to 4 (or any range that includes 2).\n2. Place an open circle at 2 (since x > 2, not x â‰¥ 2).\n3. Shade the region to the right of the open circle, indicating that all values greater than 2 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n----(2)---->\n"
