    "message_1": "A factory has to produce 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B. They have two machines M1 and M2 for production. M1 produces 3 units of A and 1 unit of B per hour, while M2 produces 1 unit of A and 2 units of B per hour. The factory has 500 hours of production time on M1 and 400 hours on M2. What is the maximum number of units of A and B that the factory can produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of hours M1 is used and y be the number of hours M2 is used.\n\nWe have two constraints based on the available production time for each machine:\n\n1) x ≤ 500 (M1 has 500 hours of production time)\n2) y ≤ 400 (M2 has 400 hours of production time)\n\nNow, let's find the production of A and B in terms of x and y:\n\nA = 3x + 1y\nB = 1x + 2y\n\nWe need to produce at least 100 units of A and 150 units of B:\n\n3) 3x + 1y ≥ 100\n4) 1x + 2y ≥ 150\n\nNow we need to find the maximum number of units of A and B that can be produced within these constraints.\n\nFirst, let's solve the system of inequalities:\n\nFrom inequality 3:\ny ≥ 100 - 3x\n\nFrom inequality 4:\nx ≥ (150 - 2y)/1\n\nNow, we will use the constraints 1 and 2:\n\nIf x = 500 (maximum hours for M1):\ny ≥ 100 - 3(500) = -1400\nSince y cannot be negative, we will use the constraint y ≤ 400:\ny = 400\n\nSo, in this case:\nA = 3(500) + 1(400) = 1900\nB = 1(500) + 2(400) = 1300\n\nIf y = 400 (maximum hours for M2):\nx ≥ (150 - 2(400))/1 = -650\nSince x cannot be negative, we will use the constraint x ≤ 500:\nx = 500\n\nSo, in this case:\nA = 3(500) + 1(400) = 1900\nB = 1(500) + 2(400) = 1300\n\nBoth cases give the same result, so the maximum number of units of A and B that the factory can produce is 1900 units of A and 1300 units of B."
