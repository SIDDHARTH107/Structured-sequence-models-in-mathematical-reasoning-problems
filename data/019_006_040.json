    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is a subfield of philosophy that deals with obligations, permissions, and prohibitions rather than a branch of mathematics. It is not feasible to provide a specific numerical problem for a math student to solve in this context. Can I assist you with anything else?",
    "message_2": "Of course! If you have any other mathematical problems or questions you'd like help with, please feel free to ask."
