    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective variety over a field K. Suppose H^1(X, O_X) = 0, and let L be an ample line bundle on X. Show that for any positive integer m, the multiplication map H^0(X, L^m) ⊗ H^0(X, L^(-m)) → H^0(X, O_X) is surjective.",
    "message_2": "To show that the multiplication map is surjective, we need to show that for any global section s ∈ H^0(X, O_X), there exist global sections t ∈ H^0(X, L^m) and u ∈ H^0(X, L^(-m)) such that s = t * u.\n\nSince L is an ample line bundle, there exists some positive integer n such that L^n is very ample. Consider the tensor product of L^m and L^(-m), which is isomorphic to L^(m-m) = L^0 = O_X. By the projection formula, we have:\n\nH^0(X, L^m) ⊗ H^0(X, L^(-m)) → H^0(X, O_X)\n\nNow, consider the short exact sequence of sheaves:\n\n0 → L^(-m) → O_X → O_X(L^m) → 0\n\nApplying the global sections functor, we get the following long exact sequence:\n\n0 → H^0(X, L^(-m)) → H^0(X, O_X) → H^0(X, O_X(L^m)) → H^1(X, L^(-m))\n\nSince H^1(X, O_X) = 0, we have H^1(X, L^(-m)) = 0 as well. Thus, the map H^0(X, O_X) → H^0(X, O_X(L^m)) is surjective. This implies that for any global section s ∈ H^0(X, O_X), there exists a global section s' ∈ H^0(X, O_X(L^m)) such that s = s'|_X.\n\nNow, we have the following commutative diagram:\n\nH^0(X, L^m) ⊗ H^0(X, L^(-m)) → H^0(X, O_X)\n      |                          |\n      v                          v\nH^0(X, O_X(L^m)) ⊗ H^0(X, L^(-m)) → H^0(X, O_X(L^m))\n\nThe vertical maps are the natural inclusions, and the horizontal maps are the multiplication maps. Since the bottom horizontal map is surjective, there exist global sections t ∈ H^0(X, L^m) and u ∈ H^0(X, L^(-m)) such that s' = t * u. Restricting to X, we have s = s'|_X = (t * u)|_X, which shows that the multiplication map H^0(X, L^m) ⊗ H^0(X, L^(-m)) → H^0(X, O_X) is surjective."
