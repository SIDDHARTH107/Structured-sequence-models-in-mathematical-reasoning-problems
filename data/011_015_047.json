    "message_2": "Yes, in a group of 6 people, there must always exist either a group of 3 people who all know each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other. This statement is known as the \"Friendship Theorem\" or \"Ramsey's Theorem for R(3, 3).\"\n\nTo prove this, let's consider one person in the group, say person A. There are 5 other people in the group, and each of them is either a friend (knows A) or a stranger (doesn't know A) to person A. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least 3 people who are either all friends or all strangers to person A.\n\nCase 1: There are 3 friends of person A.\nIf any of these 3 friends know each other, then we have a group of 3 people who all know each other (the two friends and person A). If none of these 3 friends know each other, then we have a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other.\n\nCase 2: There are 3 strangers of person A.\nIf any of these 3 strangers know each other, then we have a group of 3 people who all know each other. If none of these 3 strangers know each other, then we have a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other.\n\nIn both cases, we find that there must always exist either a group of 3 people who all know each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other."
