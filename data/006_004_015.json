    "message_1": "A game involves rolling a fair 6-sided dice. If you get a 3 or a 4, you win $10. If you get a 1, 2, 5, or 6, you lose $5. What is the probability that you will win money if you play this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning money in this game, we need to determine the probability of rolling a 3 or a 4.\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair 6-sided dice: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these outcomes, 2 of them (3 and 4) result in winning money.\n\nSo, the probability of winning money is the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 3 or 4) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nProbability of winning money = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2/6\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability of winning money = 1/3 or approximately 0.3333, which is about 33.33% chance of winning money if you play this game."
