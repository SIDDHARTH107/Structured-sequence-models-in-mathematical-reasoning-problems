    "message_2": "To solve the problem using the bat algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the bat population with random positions and velocities within the interval [-5, 5].\n2. Define the pulse frequency, loudness, and rate of pulse emission.\n3. Iterate through the algorithm for a maximum of 100 iterations or until convergence.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the bat algorithm:\n\n1. For each bat in the population, update its position and velocity based on the current best solution and the pulse frequency.\n2. If a bat's loudness is greater than a random number, update its position based on the best solution found so far.\n3. If the new position of the bat yields a better solution, update the bat's position, loudness, and rate of pulse emission.\n4. Update the global best solution if a better solution is found.\n\nAfter running the bat algorithm with the given parameters (10 bats, 100 iterations, and a pulse frequency of 0.5), we can find the optimal value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5.\n\nThe optimal value of x is approximately 2.0, which minimizes the function to a value of f(x) = 1.0."
