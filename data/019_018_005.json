    "message_2": "To prove the statement, let's use the definition of even and odd numbers and a bit of algebra.\n\nDefinition: An even integer is any integer that can be written in the form 2k, where k is an integer. An odd integer is any integer that can be written in the form 2k+1, where k is an integer.\n\nGiven: n is an even integer.\n\nWe can write n as 2k, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, we need to prove that 3n+1 is always odd.\n\nLet's substitute n with 2k in the expression 3n+1:\n\n3(2k) + 1 = 6k + 1\n\nNow, let's analyze the resulting expression. We have 6k + 1, which can be written as 2(3k) + 1. Since 3k is an integer (as the product of two integers), let's denote it as m, where m = 3k.\n\nNow, our expression becomes:\n\n2m + 1\n\nThis is in the form of an odd integer (2k+1), where m is an integer.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that if n is an even integer, then 3n+1 is always odd."
