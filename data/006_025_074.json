    "message_1": "A magician is performing a card trick where a spectator chooses a card from a deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that the selected card is either a spade or a face card (King, Queen, or Jack)?",
    "message_2": "There are 13 spades in a deck of 52 cards. There are 12 face cards in total (3 face cards per suit, and there are 4 suits). However, there are 3 face cards that are also spades (King, Queen, and Jack of Spades), which we should not count twice.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (spades) + 12 (face cards) - 3 (spade face cards) = 22.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 52 (total cards in the deck).\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a card that is either a spade or a face card is:\n\nP(spade or face card) = (favorable outcomes) / (total outcomes) = 22 / 52 = 11 / 26."
