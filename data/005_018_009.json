    "message_2": "To find the 5-year survival rate, we need to determine the number of patients who survived after 5 years and then calculate the percentage of the total patients.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many patients survived after 5 years:\n\nTotal patients = 1000\nPatients who died within 5 years = 350\n\nPatients who survived after 5 years = Total patients - Patients who died within 5 years\nPatients who survived after 5 years = 1000 - 350 = 650\n\nNow, let's calculate the 5-year survival rate:\n\n5-year survival rate = (Patients who survived after 5 years / Total patients) * 100\n5-year survival rate = (650 / 1000) * 100 = 65%\n\nThe 5-year survival rate of the patients with this illness is 65%."
