    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the first iteration, the length is 1 unit. With each subsequent iteration, the length doubles. To find the length of the eighth iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * 2^(n-1)\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nLength = 1 * 2^(8-1) = 1 * 2^7 = 1 * 128 = 128 cm\n\nThe length of the eighth iteration of the Dragon curve is 128 cm.\n\nSince the Dragon curve is a continuous curve without any closed loops, the perimeter is the same as the length. Therefore, the perimeter of the eighth iteration of the Dragon curve is also 128 cm."
