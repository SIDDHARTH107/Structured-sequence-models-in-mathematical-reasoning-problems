    "message_2": "To evaluate the contour integral $\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-2}dz$, we first rewrite the integrand as follows:\n\n$$\\frac{f(z)}{z-2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{z-1}}{z-2} = \\frac{1}{(z-1)(z-2)}.$$\n\nNow, we notice that the function has singularities at $z=1$ and $z=2$. However, since the contour $C$ is given by $|z|=2$, only the singularity at $z=1$ is inside the contour.\n\nWe can use the residue theorem to evaluate the contour integral. The residue theorem states that for a function $f(z)$ with isolated singularities inside a closed contour $C$,\n\n$$\\oint_C f(z)dz = 2\\pi i \\sum_{k=1}^n \\text{Res}(f, a_k),$$\n\nwhere $\\text{Res}(f, a_k)$ is the residue of $f(z)$ at the singularity $a_k$.\n\nIn our case, we have only one singularity inside the contour $C$, which is at $z=1$. To find the residue at $z=1$, we can use the following formula for simple poles:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f, a) = \\lim_{z \\to a} (z-a) f(z).$$\n\nApplying this formula to our function, we get:\n\n$$\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{(z-1)(z-2)}, 1\\right) = \\lim_{z \\to 1} (z-1) \\frac{1}{(z-1)(z-2)} = \\lim_{z \\to 1} \\frac{1}{z-2} = 1.$$\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the contour integral:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-2}dz = 2\\pi i \\sum_{k=1}^n \\text{Res}(f, a_k) = 2\\pi i (1) = 2\\pi i.$$\n\nTherefore, the value of the contour integral is $2\\pi i$."
