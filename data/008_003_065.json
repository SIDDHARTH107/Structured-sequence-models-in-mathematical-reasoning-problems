    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the row echelon form of the matrix. Let's perform the following row operations:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row: R2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n2. Subtract 3 times the first row from the third row: R3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\nThe matrix A becomes:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nNow, the row echelon form of the matrix A is obtained. The rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row echelon form. In this case, there is only 1 non-zero row.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the matrix A is 1."
