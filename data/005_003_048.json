The data collected is as follows:\n\nHours Studied (x): 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18\nExam Score (y): 60, 64, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92\n\nFind the regression equation for predicting the exam score of a student who studies 13 hours per week, using the linear regression model.",
    "message_2": "To find the regression equation, we need to calculate the slope (b1) and the y-intercept (b0) of the line of best fit using the given data. The formulas for b1 and b0 are:\n\nb1 = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\nb0 = ȳ - b1 * x̄\n\nwhere xi and yi are the individual data points, x̄ is the mean of the x values, and ȳ is the mean of the y values.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the x values (x̄) and the mean of the y values (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18) / 8 = 89 / 8 = 11.125\nȳ = (60 + 64 + 72 + 76 + 80 + 84 + 88 + 92) / 8 = 616 / 8 = 77\n\nNow, let's calculate b1:\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)^2 = (5-11.125)^2 + (6-11.125)^2 + (8-11.125)^2 + (10-11.125)^2 + (12-11.125)^2 + (14-11.125)^2 + (16-11.125)^2 + (18-11.125)^2 = 186.875\n\nΣ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = (5-11.125)(60-77) + (6-11.125)(64-77) + (8-11.125)(72-77) + (10-11.125)(76-77) + (12-11.125)(80-77) + (14-11.125)(84-77) + (16-11.125)(88-77) + (18-11.125)(92-77) = 372.5\n\nb1 = 372.5 / 186.875 = 1.992\n\nNow, let's calculate b0:\n\nb0 = ȳ - b1 * x̄ = 77 - 1.992 * 11.125 = 77 - 22.151 = 54.849\n\nThe regression equation is:\n\ny = b0 + b1 * x\ny = 54.849 + 1.992 * x\n\nNow, we can use this equation to predict the exam score of a student who studies 13 hours per week:\n\ny = 54.849 + 1.992 * 13 = 54.849 + 25.896 = 80.745\n\nSo, the predicted exam score for a student who studies 13 hours per week is approximately 80.745."
