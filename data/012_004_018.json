    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding the edge doesn't form a cycle in the tree.\n4. Repeat step 3 until we have V-1 edges in the minimum spanning tree, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nLet's follow these steps for the given graph G:\n\n1. Sort the edges:\n\n   (E,A,5), (B,C,6), (A,C,6), (A,B,8), (C,D,7), (D,E,9), (B,E,10)\n\n2. Start with an empty graph:\n\n   Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) = {}\n\n3. Add edges one by one:\n\n   - Add (E,A,5) to MST: MST = {(E,A,5)}\n   - Add (B,C,6) to MST: MST = {(E,A,5), (B,C,6)}\n   - Add (A,C,6) to MST: MST = {(E,A,5), (B,C,6), (A,C,6)}\n   - Adding (A,B,8) would form a cycle, so skip it.\n   - Add (C,D,7) to MST: MST = {(E,A,5), (B,C,6), (A,C,6), (C,D,7)}\n   - Adding (D,E,9) would form a cycle, so skip it.\n   - Adding (B,E,10) would form a cycle, so skip it.\n\n4. We now have V-1 = 5-1 = 4 edges in the minimum spanning tree:\n\n   Minimum Spanning Tree: {(E,A,5), (B,C,6), (A,C,6), (C,D,7)}\n\nSo, the minimum spanning tree of G using Kruskal's algorithm is:\n\n   {(E,A,5), (B,C,6), (A,C,6), (C,D,7)}"
