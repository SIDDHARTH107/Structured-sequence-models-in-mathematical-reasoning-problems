    "message_2": "To see why this is true, consider the following:\n\nThe fundamental group of a topological space, denoted as $\\pi_1(X)$, is a group that captures the essential information about the loops in the space $X$. In the case of the circle $S^1$, we can think of loops as continuous maps from the interval $[0, 1]$ to the circle, with the endpoints of the interval being identified (i.e., $f(0) = f(1)$).\n\nNow, consider the winding number of a loop around the circle. The winding number is an integer that counts how many times the loop winds around the circle, with positive values for counterclockwise winding and negative values for clockwise winding. We can define a homomorphism $\\phi: \\pi_1(S^1) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ that sends each loop to its winding number.\n\nThis homomorphism is surjective, as for any integer $n$, we can find a loop that winds around the circle $n$ times. It is also injective, as two loops with different winding numbers cannot be continuously deformed into each other without breaking the loop. Therefore, $\\phi$ is an isomorphism, and we have $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
