    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, by the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G divides 1 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, there must be exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup in G, say H. Since H is the only 5-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. \n\nNow, let's consider the structure of H. Since H has order 5, which is prime, H must be cyclic, generated by some element a with order 5, i.e., H = ⟨a⟩.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G/H| = |G|/|H| = 25/5 = 5, G/H is a cyclic group of order 5. Let bH be a generator of G/H, where b is an element in G. Then the order of bH in G/H is 5, which means that (bH)^5 = b^5H = H, so b^5 ∈ H. Since H is generated by a, we can write b^5 = a^k for some integer k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 4.\n\nNow, we claim that G is generated by the elements a and b. To see this, let g be an arbitrary element in G. Since G/H is generated by bH, we can write gH = (bH)^n for some integer n, which means g ∈ b^nH. Thus, there exists an element h ∈ H such that g = b^n * h. Since H is generated by a, we can write h = a^m for some integer m. Therefore, g = b^n * a^m, which shows that G is generated by a and b.\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: k = 1\nIn this case, b^5 = a, and since a and b generate G, we have that G is cyclic, generated by the element ab, because (ab)^5 = a^5 * b^5 = a^5 * a = a^6 = (a^5)^2 * a = e^2 * a = a, and (ab)^{25} = (a^5 * b^5)^5 = a^{25} * b^{25} = e * e = e.\n\nCase 2: k ≠ 1\nIn this case, 1 < k < 5, and gcd(k, 5) = 1, since 5 is prime. Now, we claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, i.e., G ≅ ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩. To show this, we need to show that G is the internal direct product of ⟨a⟩ and ⟨b⟩. \n\nFirst, note that |⟨a⟩| * |⟨b⟩| = 5 * 5 = 25 = |G|. Next, we need to show that ⟨a⟩ ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e}. Suppose there exists an element g ≠ e in both ⟨a⟩ and ⟨b⟩. Then g = a^x = b^y for some integers x and y. But then, g^5 = (a^x)^5 = (b^y)^5 = b^{5y} = a^{5x} = e, which implies that g has order 5 in both ⟨a⟩ and ⟨b⟩. However, this contradicts the fact that a and b have unique orders in their respective cyclic groups. Thus, ⟨a⟩ ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e}.\n\nSince |G| = |⟨a⟩| * |⟨b⟩| and ⟨a⟩ ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e}, we can conclude that G is the internal direct product of ⟨a⟩ and ⟨b⟩, and therefore G ≅ ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩, which are both cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
