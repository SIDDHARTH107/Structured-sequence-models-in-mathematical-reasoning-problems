This means that one vertex has a degree of 5 (connected to all other vertices), one vertex has a degree of 4 (connected to four other vertices), one vertex has a degree of 3 (connected to three other vertices), one vertex has a degree of 2 (connected to two other vertices), one vertex has a degree of 1 (connected to one other vertex), and one vertex has a degree of 0 (not connected to any other vertices)."
