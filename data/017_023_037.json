    "message_2": "To prove that there are no other possible groups of order 72, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Let G be a group of order 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2, so by the Sylow Theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) of G divides 3^2 = 9 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 ∈ {1, 3}.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) of G divides 2^3 = 8 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 ∈ {1, 4}.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible cases for n_2 and n_3:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3, which is a cyclic group of order 72 (C72).\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be any Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, the action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_3. The kernel of φ, denoted by K, is the largest normal 2-subgroup of G contained in P_2. Since |S_3| = 6, we have |K| ∈ {1, 2, 4}. If |K| = 4, then G/K is isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2. If |K| = 2, then G is one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and we can apply the same reasoning to conclude that G is either isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that any group of order 72 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72. There are no other possibilities."
