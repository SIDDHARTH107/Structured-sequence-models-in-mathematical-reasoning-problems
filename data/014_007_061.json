    "message_1": "Bob wants to secure a message that is 20 characters long using a stream cipher. He knows that the key stream generated by the cipher is a sequence of random binary digits with a period of 63. If Bob uses the same key stream to encrypt two different messages, an attacker could easily recover both messages. Therefore, Bob generates a new key stream for each message he sends. How many bits does Bob need to randomly generate in order to have enough key streams for a million encrypted messages?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt a 20-character message, Bob needs a key stream of 20 * 8 = 160 bits (since each character is typically represented by 8 bits). \n\nNow, we need to find out how many unique key streams of 160 bits are required to have enough key streams for a million encrypted messages. \n\nSince the key stream is a sequence of random binary digits, there are 2^160 possible unique key streams of 160 bits. To find out how many bits are needed to represent a million unique key streams, we need to solve the equation:\n\n2^x = 1,000,000\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\nx = log2(1,000,000) â‰ˆ 19.93\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bit, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nx = 20 bits\n\nSo, Bob needs to randomly generate 20 bits for each key stream to have enough key streams for a million encrypted messages."
