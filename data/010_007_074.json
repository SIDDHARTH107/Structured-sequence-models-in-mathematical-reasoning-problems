    "message_2": "Let's denote the three points in p⁻¹(x₀) as y₀, y₁, and y₂. Since p: Y → X is a covering space, we know that the fundamental group of X, π₁(X,x₀), acts on the fiber p⁻¹(x₀) by deck transformations. In this case, the action is a permutation of the three points y₀, y₁, and y₂.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H of π₁(X,x₀) that stabilizes y₀, i.e., the subgroup of deck transformations that fix y₀. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the index of H in π₁(X,x₀) is equal to the size of the orbit of y₀, which is the number of points in p⁻¹(x₀). In this case, the index of H in π₁(X,x₀) is 3.\n\nSince π₁(X,x₀) = ℤ₄, we know that |π₁(X,x₀)| = 4. The only subgroup of ℤ₄ with index 3 is the trivial subgroup {0}. Therefore, H = {0}.\n\nNow, we can use the covering space theory to relate the fundamental groups of X and Y. By the Galois correspondence, there is a bijection between the subgroups of π₁(X,x₀) and the connected covering spaces of X. In particular, the fundamental group of Y, π₁(Y,y₀), corresponds to the subgroup H of π₁(X,x₀).\n\nSince H = {0}, we have that π₁(Y,y₀) is isomorphic to the quotient group π₁(X,x₀)/H, which is just ℤ₄/{0} ≅ ℤ₄. Therefore, the fundamental group of Y is ℤ₄."
