    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 4y$, we first need to find the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 6\n$$\nSetting this equal to zero, we get:\n$$\n2x - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 3\n$$\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y + 4\n$$\nSetting this equal to zero, we get:\n$$\n2y + 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = -2\n$$\n\nSo, the critical point is $(3, -2)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify the critical point using Morse Theory. To do this, we need to find the second partial derivatives and compute the Hessian matrix.\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0\n$$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n$$\nH = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The characteristic equation is:\n$$\n\\det(H - \\lambda I) = (2 - \\lambda)^2 = 0\n$$\n\nThis equation has a double root at $\\lambda = 2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the Hessian matrix is positive definite, and the critical point $(3, -2)$ is a local minimum according to Morse Theory."
