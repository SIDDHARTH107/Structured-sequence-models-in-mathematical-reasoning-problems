    "message_1": "A delivery company needs to transport a total of 500 kg of packages from its depot to various locations in the city. The company has 3 available trucks with different carrying capacities: 200 kg, 250 kg, and 300 kg. Each truck can make up to 10 deliveries per day. The company wants to optimize its routes for the day by minimizing the total distance traveled by the trucks. \n\nCalculate the optimal routing plan for the three trucks to transport all the packages, while also meeting the delivery limit of up to 10 deliveries per day per truck.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the optimal routing plan for the three trucks, we need to determine how to distribute the 500 kg of packages among the trucks while minimizing the total distance traveled. Since each truck can make up to 10 deliveries per day, we can assume that the number of deliveries is not a limiting factor in this problem.\n\nFirst, let's consider the capacities of the trucks: 200 kg, 250 kg, and 300 kg. We need to find a combination of these capacities that can carry the 500 kg of packages.\n\nOne possible combination is to use the 200 kg truck and the 300 kg truck. The 200 kg truck can carry 200 kg, and the 300 kg truck can carry the remaining 300 kg. This way, both trucks are fully utilized, and the total capacity is exactly 500 kg.\n\nNow, let's consider the routes for the two trucks. Since we want to minimize the total distance traveled, we should aim to assign packages to the trucks based on their proximity to the depot and the delivery locations. The optimal routing plan would involve the 200 kg truck delivering packages to the closest locations, while the 300 kg truck delivers packages to the farther locations.\n\nTo determine the specific routes for each truck, we would need more information about the locations of the delivery destinations and the distances between them. However, the general strategy would be to minimize the total distance traveled by both trucks by assigning packages based on proximity and truck capacity.\n\nIn summary, the optimal routing plan would involve using the 200 kg truck and the 300 kg truck, with each truck delivering packages based on their proximity to the depot and the delivery locations. This would minimize the total distance traveled by the trucks while ensuring that all 500 kg of packages are delivered."
