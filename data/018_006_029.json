    "message_1": "Let A be a subset of a universal set U such that U contains 30 elements and A contains 18 elements. How many elements are in the complement of set A? Use this information to prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in the complement of set A, we need to subtract the number of elements in set A from the total number of elements in the universal set U.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since U has 30 elements and A has 18 elements, the number of elements in A' is:\n\n|A'| = |U| - |A| = 30 - 18 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 elements in the complement of set A.\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to U. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements that are in either of the sets. In this case, the union of A and A' is the set containing all the elements that are in A or in A'.\n\nSince A contains 18 elements and A' contains 12 elements, and there are no overlapping elements between A and A' (by definition of the complement), the union of A and A' contains 18 + 12 = 30 elements.\n\nSince the union of A and A' contains all 30 elements of the universal set U, we can conclude that the union of A and its complement is equal to U:\n\nA âˆª A' = U"
