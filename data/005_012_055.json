They randomly selected 50 customers and recorded the time taken in minutes as follows: \n\n1.3, 1.5, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 2.2, 1.6, 2.0, 1.4, 1.1, 1.8, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9, 1.8, 1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 1.1, 1.3, \n2.7, 1.9, 1.3, 1.5, 1.8, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.7, 1.5, 2.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 2.4, 1.6, 1.9, 1.7, 1.5, \n1.6, 1.3, 1.9, 1.8, 1.1, 1.5\n\nIf the population standard deviation is known to be 0.4 minutes, what is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean time taken to order a drink at the store?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean time taken to order a drink at the store, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence interval = Sample mean ± (Z-score * (Population standard deviation / √Sample size))\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the sample mean:\n\nSample mean = (Sum of all recorded times) / Sample size\n\nSample mean = (1.3 + 1.5 + 1.2 + 1.4 + 1.6 + 2.2 + 1.6 + 2.0 + 1.4 + 1.1 + 1.8 + 1.5 + 1.7 + 1.9 + 1.8 + 1.2 + 1.4 + 1.7 + 1.1 + 1.3 + 2.7 + 1.9 + 1.3 + 1.5 + 1.8 + 1.5 + 1.6 + 1.8 + 1.7 + 1.5 + 2.1 + 1.2 + 1.4 + 1.4 + 1.6 + 1.5 + 1.7 + 1.8 + 2.4 + 1.6 + 1.9 + 1.7 + 1.5 + 1.6 + 1.3 + 1.9 + 1.8 + 1.1 + 1.5) / 50\n\nSample mean = 81.3 / 50\n\nSample mean = 1.626\n\nNext, we need to find the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval. The Z-score for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96.\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence interval = 1.626 ± (1.96 * (0.4 / √50))\n\nConfidence interval = 1.626 ± (1.96 * (0.4 / 7.071))\n\nConfidence interval = 1.626 ± (1.96 * 0.0566)\n\nConfidence interval = 1.626 ± 0.111\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the population mean time taken to order a drink at the store is (1.515, 1.737) minutes."
