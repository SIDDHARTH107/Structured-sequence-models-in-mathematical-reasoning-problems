    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition method, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented in matrix form as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A = | 1  1  1 |, X = | x |, and B = |  5  |\n          | 2  3  1 |      | y |      | 11  |\n          | 4  7  4 |      | z |      | 23  |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\n\nPerforming LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |, U = | 1  1  1 |\n    | 2  1  0 |      | 0  1 -1 |\n    | 4  3  1 |      | 0  0  1 |\n\nStep 2: Forward substitution\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation L * Y = B for Y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   |  5  |\n| 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 11  |\n| 4  3  1 | | y3 |   | 23  |\n\nSolving for y1, y2, and y3:\n\ny1 = 5\ny2 = 11 - 2*y1 = 1\ny3 = 23 - 4*y1 - 3*y2 = 2\n\nSo, Y = | 5 |\n          | 1 |\n          | 2 |\n\nStep 3: Backward substitution\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation U * X = Y for X:\n\n| 1  1  1 | | x |   |  5  |\n| 0  1 -1 | | y | = |  1  |\n| 0  0  1 | | z |   |  2  |\n\nSolving for x, y, and z:\n\nz = 2\ny = 1 + z = 3\nx = 5 - y - z = 0\n\nSo, X = | 0 |\n          | 3 |\n          | 2 |\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 3, and z = 2."
