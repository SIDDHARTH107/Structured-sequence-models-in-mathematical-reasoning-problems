    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order: n(G) = (p^(k-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(l-1) * (q-1)) * (r^(m-1) * (r-1)), where p, q, and r are distinct prime factors, and k, l, and m are their respective powers in the factorization.\n\nApplying the formula:\nn(G) = (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1)) * (5^(1-1) * (5-1))\nn(G) = (2^2 * 1) * (3^0 * 2) * (5^0 * 4)\nn(G) = (4 * 1) * (1 * 2) * (1 * 4)\nn(G) = 4 * 2 * 4\nn(G) = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\nTo find the number of abelian groups, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization: For 2^3, there are 3 partitions: (3), (2,1), and (1,1,1). For 3^1 and 5^1, there is only 1 partition each: (1).\n2. Multiply the number of partitions for each prime factor: 3 * 1 * 1 = 3\n\nSo, there are 3 abelian groups of order 120."
