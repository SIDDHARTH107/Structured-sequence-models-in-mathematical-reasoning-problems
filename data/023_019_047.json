    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system, we need to find the poles of the transfer function H(s). Poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero. \n\nThe transfer function H(s) is given by:\n\nH(s) = (7s^2 + 2s + 5) / (s^3 + 6s^2 + 11s + 6)\n\nFirst, let's find the poles by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\ns^3 + 6s^2 + 11s + 6 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try factoring the equation to see if it simplifies:\n\n(s + 1)(s^2 + 5s + 6) = 0\n\nNow, we can see that one of the poles is s = -1. The remaining quadratic equation can be factored further:\n\n(s + 1)(s + 2)(s + 3) = 0\n\nSo, the poles of the transfer function are s = -1, s = -2, and s = -3.\n\nNow, let's find the zeros of the transfer function by setting the numerator equal to zero:\n\n7s^2 + 2s + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find its roots:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\ns = (-2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(7)(5))) / (2 * 7)\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the zeros are complex conjugates:\n\ns = -1/7 ± (2/7)i\n\nNow that we have the poles and zeros of the transfer function, we can determine the stability of the system. A system is stable if all the poles have negative real parts. In this case, all the poles are negative (-1, -2, and -3), so the system is stable."
