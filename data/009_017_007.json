    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire's center, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nIn this case, we can consider a circular loop with a radius of 2 cm centered around the wire. The magnetic field will be tangential to the loop at every point, and its magnitude will be the same at every point on the loop due to the symmetry of the problem.\n\nMathematically, Ampere's Law can be written as:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, dl is an infinitesimal segment of the loop, and I is the enclosed current.\n\nSince the magnetic field is tangential to the loop and has the same magnitude at every point, we can simplify the equation as:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀I\n\nThe closed line integral of dl around the loop is just the circumference of the loop:\n\n∮dl = 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the loop (2 cm in this case).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnitude of the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A. The current (I) is 5 A, and the radius (r) is 2 cm or 0.02 m. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 0.02 m)\n\nB ≈ 5 × 10⁻⁶ T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire's center is approximately 5 × 10⁻⁶ T (tesla).\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current (along the wire), your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In this case, the magnetic field will be circulating around the wire in a clockwise direction when looking at the wire from above."
