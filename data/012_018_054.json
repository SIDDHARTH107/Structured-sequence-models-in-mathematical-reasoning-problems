    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In a graph with 9 vertices where each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices, the graph is a 3-regular graph.\n\nIn a 3-regular graph, the edge connectivity is equal to the minimum degree of the vertices, which in this case is 3. Therefore, the edge connectivity of this graph is 3."
