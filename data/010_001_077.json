    "message_2": "Let A = {2} and B = X \\ A be the complement of A. We want to find the interior of B.\n\nSince the closure of {1} is {1, 2, 3}, we know that {1, 2, 3} contains all the limit points of {1}. This means that there are no limit points of {1} outside of {1, 2, 3}. \n\nNow, let's consider the set B = X \\ {2}. Since 2 is not a limit point of {1}, removing 2 from X does not affect the limit points of {1}. Therefore, the closure of {1} in B is still {1, 3}. \n\nNow, let's find the interior of B. The interior of a set is the union of all open sets contained in it. Since {1} is not closed in B (its closure is {1, 3}), its complement in B, which is B \\ {1} = X \\ {1, 2}, must be open in B. Similarly, since {3} is not closed in B (its closure is {1, 3}), its complement in B, which is B \\ {3} = X \\ {2, 3}, must be open in B.\n\nTherefore, the interior of B is the union of these two open sets, which is (X \\ {1, 2}) âˆª (X \\ {2, 3}) = X \\ {2}."
