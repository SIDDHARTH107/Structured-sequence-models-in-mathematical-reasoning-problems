    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product X and Product Y. Both products require machines X and Y to manufacture. Machine X can operate for a maximum of 60 hours per week and machine Y for a maximum of 80 hours per week. Each unit of Product X requires 5 hours on machine X and 3 hours on machine Y, while each unit of Product Y requires 2 hours on machine X and 6 hours on machine Y. If the profit per unit of Product X is $10 and the profit per unit of Product Y is $15, how many units of each product should the company produce in a week to maximize their profit (assuming all products produced are sold)?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product X and y be the number of units of Product Y.\n\nThe constraints for the machines are:\n5x + 2y ≤ 60 (Machine X constraint)\n3x + 6y ≤ 80 (Machine Y constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n5x + 2y ≤ 60\n2y ≤ -5x + 60\ny ≤ -5/2x + 30\n\n3x + 6y ≤ 80\n6y ≤ -3x + 80\ny ≤ -1/2x + 40/3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. We will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the equality of the constraints:\n\n1) Intersection of the two lines:\n5x + 2y = 60\n3x + 6y = 80\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3 to match the coefficients of y:\n15x + 6y = 180\n3x + 6y = 80\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n12x = 100\nx = 100/12 = 25/3\n\nNow, substituting x back into one of the equations to find y:\n3(25/3) + 6y = 80\n25 + 6y = 80\n6y = 55\ny = 55/6\n\nSo, the intersection point is (25/3, 55/6).\n\n2) Intersection with the x-axis (y = 0):\n5x + 2(0) = 60\nx = 12\n\n3) Intersection with the y-axis (x = 0):\n3(0) + 6y = 80\ny = 40/3\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (12, 0), (0, 40/3), and (25/3, 55/6).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0\nP(12, 0) = 10(12) + 15(0) = 120\nP(0, 40/3) = 10(0) + 15(40/3) = 200\nP(25/3, 55/6) = 10(25/3) + 15(55/6) = 250/3 + 825/6 = 750/6 = 125\n\nThe maximum profit is $125, which occurs when the company produces 25/3 units of Product X and 55/6 units of Product Y. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a product, they should produce 8 units of Product X and 9 units of Product Y to achieve a profit close to the maximum."
