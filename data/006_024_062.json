    "message_1": "A student is planning to travel from New York to Los Angeles. The probability that their flight will be on-time is 0.85. Given that their flight is on-time, the probability of their luggage arriving at the same time is 0.95. What is the probability that the student's flight will be on-time and their luggage will arrive at the same time?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both the student's flight will be on-time and their luggage will arrive at the same time, we can multiply the probabilities of these two events occurring together.\n\nProbability of flight being on-time = 0.85\nProbability of luggage arriving at the same time given the flight is on-time = 0.95\n\nProbability of both events occurring together = 0.85 * 0.95 = 0.8075\n\nSo, the probability that the student's flight will be on-time and their luggage will arrive at the same time is 0.8075 or 80.75%."
