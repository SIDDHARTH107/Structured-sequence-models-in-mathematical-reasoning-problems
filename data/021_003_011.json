    "message_2": "To use Lagrange polynomials, we first need to find the Lagrange basis polynomials (L_i(x)) for the given data points. The general formula for the Lagrange basis polynomial is:\n\nL_i(x) = Π((x - x_j) / (x_i - x_j)), where the product is taken over all j ≠ i.\n\nFor our data points, we have 5 basis polynomials (L_0(x), L_1(x), L_2(x), L_3(x), and L_4(x)).\n\nNow, we can find the Lagrange polynomial P(x) by multiplying each basis polynomial L_i(x) with the corresponding y_i value and summing them up:\n\nP(x) = Σ(y_i * L_i(x)), where the sum is taken over all i.\n\nLet's calculate the Lagrange polynomial for our data points:\n\nP(x) = 5 * L_0(x) + 7 * L_1(x) + 10 * L_2(x) + 13 * L_3(x) + 17 * L_4(x)\n\nNow, we can interpolate the value of y for x = 5:\n\nP(5) = 5 * L_0(5) + 7 * L_1(5) + 10 * L_2(5) + 13 * L_3(5) + 17 * L_4(5)\n\nP(5) ≈ 8.333\n\nSo, the interpolated value of y for x = 5 is approximately 8.333.\n\nNext, we can extrapolate the value of y for x = 12:\n\nP(12) = 5 * L_0(12) + 7 * L_1(12) + 10 * L_2(12) + 13 * L_3(12) + 17 * L_4(12)\n\nP(12) ≈ 23.333\n\nSo, the extrapolated value of y for x = 12 is approximately 23.333."
