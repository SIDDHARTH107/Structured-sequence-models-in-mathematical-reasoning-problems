If a force of 120 N is acting on the object, find the work done to move the object from x = 2 m to x = 8 m. Use integration to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done to move the object from x = 2 m to x = 8 m, we will use the formula:\n\nW = ∫(F * dx) from x = 2 to x = 8\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force acting on the object, and dx is the change in displacement.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between force and displacement. We know that force is related to acceleration, and acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. We are given the velocity squared function, v² = 4x + 16. To find the velocity function, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nv = √(4x + 16)\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration function, a(x), by taking the derivative of the velocity function with respect to x:\n\nv = √(4x + 16)\ndv/dx = a(x)\n\nTo find the derivative, we can use the chain rule:\n\ndv/dx = (1/2) * (4x + 16)^(-1/2) * 4\n\nNow, we know that force F = m * a(x), where m is the mass of the object (100 kg). So, we can write the force function as:\n\nF(x) = 100 * (1/2) * (4x + 16)^(-1/2) * 4\n\nNow, we can integrate the force function with respect to x from 2 to 8 to find the work done:\n\nW = ∫(F * dx) from x = 2 to x = 8\nW = ∫(100 * (1/2) * (4x + 16)^(-1/2) * 4 * dx) from x = 2 to x = 8\n\nW = 200 * ∫((4x + 16)^(-1/2) * dx) from x = 2 to x = 8\n\nNow, we can use substitution to solve the integral:\n\nLet u = 4x + 16\ndu/dx = 4\ndx = du/4\n\nW = 200 * ∫(u^(-1/2) * (du/4)) from u = 24 to u = 48\n\nW = 50 * ∫(u^(-1/2) * du) from u = 24 to u = 48\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nW = 50 * [2 * u^(1/2)] from u = 24 to u = 48\n\nW = 100 * [√48 - √24]\n\nW = 100 * (6.928 - 4.899)\n\nW = 100 * 2.029\n\nW ≈ 202.9 J\n\nTherefore, the work done to move the object from x = 2 m to x = 8 m is approximately 202.9 Joules."
