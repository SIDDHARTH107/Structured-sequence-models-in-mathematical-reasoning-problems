    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the differential equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function y(t) is given by:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[y(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t) and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides of the given differential equation, we have:\n\nFourier{y''(t)} + 4 * Fourier{y(t)} = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transforms of y(t) and y''(t). Using the properties of the Fourier transform, we know that:\n\nFourier{y'(t)} = iω * Y(ω)\nFourier{y''(t)} = (iω)^2 * Y(ω) = -ω^2 * Y(ω)\n\nSubstituting these into the transformed differential equation, we get:\n\n-ω^2 * Y(ω) + 4 * Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) * (-ω^2 + 4) = 0\n\nSince Y(ω) is not zero, we have:\n\n-ω^2 + 4 = 0\nω^2 = 4\nω = ±2\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get y(t):\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) * ∫[Y(ω) * e^(iωt)] dω\n\nSince we know the initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 0, we can use them to find the constants in the solution. The general solution of the given differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = A * cos(2t) + B * sin(2t)\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 2 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) => A = 2\ny'(t) = -2A * sin(2t) + 2B * cos(2t)\ny'(0) = 0 = -2A * sin(0) + 2B * cos(0) => B = 0\n\nSo, the solution of the initial value problem is:\n\ny(t) = 2 * cos(2t) for t > 0"
