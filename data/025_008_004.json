    "message_2": "The Hodge diamond is a way to display the Hodge numbers of a complex projective variety in a diamond-shaped grid. For a complex projective variety of dimension 3, the Hodge diamond has the following structure:\n\n```\n          h^{0,0}\n      h^{1,0}   h^{0,1}\n  h^{2,0}   h^{1,1}   h^{0,2}\nh^{3,0}   h^{2,1}   h^{1,2}   h^{0,3}\n  h^{3,1}   h^{2,2}   h^{1,3}\n      h^{3,2}   h^{2,3}\n          h^{3,3}\n```\n\nWe are given that h^{1,1} = 5 and h^{2,1} = 21. We can fill in the Hodge diamond with these values:\n\n```\n          h^{0,0}\n      h^{1,0}   h^{0,1}\n  h^{2,0}     5     h^{0,2}\nh^{3,0}    21    h^{1,2}   h^{0,3}\n  h^{3,1}   h^{2,2}   h^{1,3}\n      h^{3,2}   h^{2,3}\n          h^{3,3}\n```\n\nNow, we can use the properties of the Hodge diamond to fill in the remaining values. The Hodge diamond has the following symmetries:\n\n1. Horizontal symmetry: h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}\n2. Diagonal symmetry: h^{p,q} = h^{3-p,3-q} (since the dimension is 3)\n\nUsing these symmetries, we can fill in the remaining values:\n\n```\n          1\n      h^{1,0}   h^{0,1}\n  h^{2,0}     5     h^{0,2}\nh^{3,0}    21    21    h^{0,3}\n  h^{3,1}   h^{2,2}   h^{1,3}\n      h^{3,2}   h^{2,3}\n          1\n```\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic of a complex projective variety is given by the alternating sum of its Hodge numbers:\n\nχ(X) = ∑(-1)^(p+q) h^{p,q}\n\nFor a complex projective variety of dimension 3, the Euler characteristic is 0. Using the values we have filled in so far, we can solve for the remaining Hodge numbers:\n\n0 = 1 - h^{1,0} - h^{0,1} + 5 + h^{2,0} + h^{0,2} - h^{3,0} - h^{0,3} + 1\n\nWe can simplify this equation to:\n\nh^{1,0} + h^{0,1} - h^{2,0} - h^{0,2} + h^{3,0} + h^{0,3} = 6\n\nSince h^{1,0} = h^{0,1}, h^{2,0} = h^{0,2}, and h^{3,0} = h^{0,3}, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2h^{1,0} - 2h^{2,0} + 2h^{3,0} = 6\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\nh^{1,0} - h^{2,0} + h^{3,0} = 3\n\nWe can now choose values for h^{1,0}, h^{2,0}, and h^{3,0} that satisfy this equation. One possible solution is h^{1,0} = 1, h^{2,0} = 0, and h^{3,0} = 2. Using the symmetries of the Hodge diamond, we can fill in the remaining values:\n\n```\n          1\n        1       1\n    0       5       0\n  2      21      21      2\n    0       h^{2,2}     1\n        1       0\n          1\n```\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that the sum of the Hodge numbers along the diagonal is equal to the Betti numbers:\n\nb_0 = h^{0,0} + h^{3,3} = 1 + 1 = 2\nb_1 = h^{1,0} + h^{2,3} = 1 + 0 = 1\nb_2 = h^{2,0} + h^{1,1} + h^{0,2} = 0 + 5 + 0 = 5\nb_3 = h^{3,0} + h^{0,3} = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSince b_2 = b_0 + b_1 + b_3, we can find the value of h^{2,2}:\n\n5 = 2 + 1 + 4 - h^{2,2}\n\nh^{2,2} = 2\n\nNow, we can fill in the final value of the Hodge diamond:\n\n```\n          1\n        1       1\n    0       5       0\n  2      21      21      2\n    0       2       1\n        1       0\n          1\n```\n\nSo, the Hodge diamond of the complex projective variety X is:\n\n```\n          1\n        1       1\n    0       5       0\n  2      21      21      2\n    0       2       1\n        1       0\n          1\n```"
