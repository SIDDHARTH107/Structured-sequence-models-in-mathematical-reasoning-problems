    "message_1": "A landscape architect wants to design a rectangular garden bed that has a perimeter of 36 feet. The garden bed needs to have the largest possible area. What should be the dimensions of the garden bed?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the area of a rectangle with a given perimeter, the rectangle should be a square. This is because, for a fixed perimeter, the area of a rectangle is maximized when its length and width are equal.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width. We are given that the perimeter is 36 feet, so:\n\n36 = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we want to maximize the area, we'll make the rectangle a square, so L = W. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n36 = 2L + 2L\n36 = 4L\nL = 9 feet\n\nSince L = W, the width is also 9 feet. Therefore, the dimensions of the garden bed should be 9 feet by 9 feet to have the largest possible area."
