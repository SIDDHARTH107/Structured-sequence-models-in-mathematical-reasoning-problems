    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n2. Determine the possible combinations of cyclic groups: (Z_2, Z_2, Z_2, Z_3), (Z_4, Z_2, Z_3), (Z_8, Z_3)\n3. Determine the number of non-isomorphic groups for each combination using the formula:\n\n   G(p^a, q^b) = (p^(ab) - 1)/(p - 1)\n\n   For (Z_2, Z_2, Z_2, Z_3): G(2^3, 3^1) = (2^(3*1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = (8 - 1)/1 = 7\n   For (Z_4, Z_2, Z_3): G(2^2, 3^1) = (2^(2*1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = (4 - 1)/1 = 3\n   For (Z_8, Z_3): G(2^3, 3^1) = (2^(3*1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = (8 - 1)/1 = 7\n\n4. Add the number of non-isomorphic groups for each combination: 7 + 3 + 7 = 17\n\nTherefore, there are 17 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
