    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of 8 centimeters and a height of 10 centimeters. What is its area in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a right triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 centimeters and the height is 10 centimeters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 × 10) / 2\n\nArea = 80 / 2\n\nArea = 40 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the right triangle is 40 square centimeters."
