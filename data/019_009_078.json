    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, the material implication (→) is defined as follows:\n\np → q is true if and only if either p is false or q is true.\n\nGiven p = 0 (false) and q = 1 (true), let's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. (p → q) is true, since p is false.\n2. (q → p) is false, since q is true and p is false.\n3. (p ∧ q) is false, since p is false and q is true.\n4. ((p → q) ∧ (q → p)) is false, since (p → q) is true and (q → p) is false.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the whole expression:\n\n((p → q) ∧ (q → p)) → (p ∧ q)\n\nSince ((p → q) ∧ (q → p)) is false, and (p ∧ q) is false, the whole expression is true. In intuitionistic logic, if the antecedent of a material implication is false, the implication is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n\nSo, the value of the expression is 1 (true)."
