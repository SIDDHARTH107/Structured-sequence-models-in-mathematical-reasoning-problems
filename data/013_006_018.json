    "message_1": "In a game of Stag Hunt, two hunters must decide whether to hunt Stag or Rabbit. If both hunters choose to hunt Stag, they will earn a reward of 20 points each. If one hunter chooses Stag and the other chooses Rabbit, the hunter who chose Stag gets nothing and the other gets 10 points. If both hunters choose Rabbit, they will each earn a reward of 5 points. \n\nSuppose one hunter always hunts Stag while the other hunter switches between Stag and Rabbit. If they play this game 10 times, what is the minimum number of times the second hunter needs to choose Stag in order to ensure a total of at least 50 points for themselves?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of times the second hunter chooses Stag as x and the number of times they choose Rabbit as y. Since they play the game 10 times, we have x + y = 10.\n\nWhen the second hunter chooses Stag, they earn 20 points, and when they choose Rabbit, they earn 10 points. To ensure a total of at least 50 points, we need to find the minimum value of x such that:\n\n20x + 10y ≥ 50\n\nSince x + y = 10, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n20x + 10(10 - x) ≥ 50\n20x + 100 - 10x ≥ 50\n10x ≥ -50\nx ≥ -5\n\nSince x must be a non-negative integer (as it represents the number of times the second hunter chooses Stag), the minimum value of x is 0. However, if x = 0, the second hunter would only choose Rabbit, and their total points would be 10 * 10 = 100, which is not possible because the first hunter always chooses Stag.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the next smallest integer value of x that satisfies the inequality:\n\nx = 1\n\nIf the second hunter chooses Stag once (x = 1) and Rabbit nine times (y = 9), their total points would be:\n\n20(1) + 10(9) = 20 + 90 = 110\n\nSince 110 is greater than or equal to 50, the minimum number of times the second hunter needs to choose Stag to ensure a total of at least 50 points for themselves is 1."
