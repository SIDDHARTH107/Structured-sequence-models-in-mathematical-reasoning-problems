    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial condition, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (X(x)Y(y)T(t))}{\\partial t} = \\Delta (X(x)Y(y)T(t))$\n\nDividing both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$, we obtain:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{X(x)Y(y)}\\Delta (X(x)Y(y))$\n\nNow, let's compute the Laplacian of the product $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\Delta (X(x)Y(y)) = \\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2}Y(y) + \\frac{\\partial^2 Y(y)}{\\partial y^2}X(x)$\n\nDividing by $X(x)Y(y)$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{\\partial^2 Y(y)}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t}$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $x$ and $y$, and the right-hand side depends only on $t$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will denote by $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{\\partial^2 Y(y)}{\\partial y^2} = -k^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2} = -k^2X(x)$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 Y(y)}{\\partial y^2} = -k^2Y(y)$\n\nThe solutions to these equations are:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cos(ky) + D\\sin(ky)$\n\nNow, we can write the solution for $u(x, y, t)$ as:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = (A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx))(C\\cos(ky) + D\\sin(ky))T(t)$\n\nTo satisfy the initial condition $u(x, y, 0) = e^{-x^2 - y^2}$, we need to choose the coefficients $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ appropriately. In this case, we can choose $A = C = 1$, $B = D = 0$, and $k = 0$. This gives us:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = T(t)$\n\nNow we need to find the function $T(t)$. We have the following ordinary differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t} = -k^2T(t)$\n\nSince $k = 0$, this equation becomes:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t} = 0$\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\n$T(t) = E$, where $E$ is a constant.\n\nTo satisfy the initial condition, we need $T(0) = e^{-x^2 - y^2}$, so we choose $E = 1$. Thus, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = e^{-x^2 - y^2}$\n\nThis solution is independent of time, so the plot of $|u(x, y, t)|$ vs. $x$ and $y$ at $t = 1$ will be the same as the plot at $t = 0$. The plot will be a Gaussian function centered at the origin with a maximum value of 1."
