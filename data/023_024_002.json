    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for f(x), we need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following equation:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nTo find b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * x)) dx, integrated over one period.\n\nFor our function, we have two intervals to consider: -π ≤ x < 0 and 0 ≤ x < π. We'll break the integral into two parts and then sum them up:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(-π to 0)(0 * sin(n * x) dx) + ∫(0 to π)(x * sin(n * x) dx)]\n\nThe first integral is zero since the function is zero in that interval. So we only need to compute the second integral:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(0 to π)(x * sin(n * x) dx)\n\nTo solve this integral, we'll use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\nThen, du = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nNow, using integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = u*v - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x * (1/n) * cos(n * x))|_0^π + (1/n) * ∫(0 to π)(cos(n * x) dx)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π * (1/n) * cos(n * π) + 0) + (1/n) * [(1/n) * sin(n * x)|_0^π]]\n\nSince cos(n * π) is 1 for even n and -1 for odd n, and sin(n * x) is 0 at x = 0 and x = π:\n\nb_n = {0, for even n; (2/n), for odd n}\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ[((2/n) * sin(n * x))], where the summation is over odd n values.\n\nTo find the value of f(π/2), we plug x = π/2 into the Fourier series:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ[((2/n) * sin(n * π/2))], where the summation is over odd n values.\n\nFor odd n, sin(n * π/2) is 1 for n = 1, 3, 5, ... and -1 for n = 2, 4, 6, ...\n\nf(π/2) = 2 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...)\n\nThis is the Leibniz formula for π/4:\n\nπ/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...\n\nSo, f(π/2) = 2 * (π/4) = π/2."
