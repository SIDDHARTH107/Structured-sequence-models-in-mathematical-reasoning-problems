So, B ∩ B = B = {0, 1}.\n\nNow, let's find A × (B ∩ B) = A × B, since B ∩ B = B.\n\nA × B = {(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∩ (A × B). Intersection of a set with itself is the set itself. So, (A × B) ∩ (A × B) = A × B = {(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)}\n\nSince A × (B ∩ B) = (A × B) ∩ (A × B), the result does not show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection. However, it is important to note that this example does not prove that the Cartesian product is associative with respect to intersection either. It just shows that in this particular case, the two expressions are equal."
