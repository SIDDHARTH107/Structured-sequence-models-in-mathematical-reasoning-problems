    "message_1": "Assume that John has two bags of marbles. Bag A contains 10 red marbles and 5 blue marbles. Bag B contains 8 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. John randomly selects one marble from Bag A and puts it in Bag B, and then he randomly selects one marble from Bag B. What is the probability that the marble John selects from Bag B is red, given that he selected a blue marble from Bag A?",
    "message_2": "We are given that John selected a blue marble from Bag A. After transferring the blue marble to Bag B, Bag B now contains 8 red marbles and 5 blue marbles, for a total of 13 marbles.\n\nThe probability of selecting a red marble from Bag B is the number of red marbles in Bag B divided by the total number of marbles in Bag B:\n\nProbability = (Number of red marbles in Bag B) / (Total number of marbles in Bag B)\n\nProbability = 8 red marbles / 13 total marbles\n\nProbability = 8/13\n\nSo, the probability that John selects a red marble from Bag B, given that he selected a blue marble from Bag A, is 8/13."
