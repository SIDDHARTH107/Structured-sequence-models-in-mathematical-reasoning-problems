    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping that maps the region |z| < 1 onto the upper half of the complex plane, we need to find a function g(z) such that g(f(z)) maps the unit disk onto the upper half-plane.\n\nFirst, let's consider the function h(z) = z^2. This function maps the unit disk onto itself, but it doubles the angles. To see this, let z = r * e^(iθ), where r < 1 and θ is the angle of z. Then h(z) = r^2 * e^(2iθ). The magnitude of h(z) is r^2, which is less than 1, and the angle of h(z) is 2θ.\n\nNow, let's consider the function f(z) = z^2 + 2iz. This function is a composition of h(z) and the translation function t(z) = z + 2i. The function t(z) maps the unit disk onto itself, and it translates the angles by a constant amount.\n\nTo map the unit disk onto the upper half-plane, we can use the Möbius transformation g(z) = (z - i) / (z + i). This function maps the unit disk onto the upper half-plane, and it preserves angles. To see this, let z = r * e^(iθ), where r < 1 and θ is the angle of z. Then g(z) = (r * e^(iθ) - i) / (r * e^(iθ) + i). The magnitude of g(z) is (r^2 + 1) / (r^2 + 2r * cos(θ) + 1), which is greater than 0, and the angle of g(z) is θ - π/2.\n\nNow, let's find the conformal mapping G(z) = g(f(z)). We have:\n\nG(z) = g(z^2 + 2iz) = ((z^2 + 2iz) - i) / ((z^2 + 2iz) + i)\n\nThis function maps the region |z| < 1 onto the upper half of the complex plane, and it preserves angles."
