    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is a fractal that increases the length of a line segment by a factor of 4/3 at each iteration.\n\nAfter five iterations, the length of each side of the Koch island will be:\n\nInitial side length × (4/3)^5\n10 × (4/3)^5 = 10 × (1024/243) ≈ 42.1227 units\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, it has three equal sides. Therefore, the perimeter of the Koch island after five iterations is:\n\nPerimeter = 3 × Length of one side\nPerimeter ≈ 3 × 42.1227 ≈ 126.3681 units"
