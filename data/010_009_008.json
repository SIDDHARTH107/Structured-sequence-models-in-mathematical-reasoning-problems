    "message_1": "A triangle has a perimeter of 24 units. If it is divided into two smaller triangles by connecting the midpoints of two sides, what is the perimeter of the smaller triangles?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c. The perimeter of the triangle is given as a + b + c = 24 units.\n\nWhen we connect the midpoints of two sides, we create two smaller triangles, both of which are similar to the original triangle. The ratio of the sides of the smaller triangles to the original triangle is 1:2, as the midpoints divide the sides in half.\n\nLet's consider one of the smaller triangles. Its sides will be a/2, b/2, and c/2. The perimeter of this smaller triangle will be:\n\n(a/2) + (b/2) + (c/2)\n\nSince a + b + c = 24, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n(24/2) = 12 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of each smaller triangle is 12 units."
