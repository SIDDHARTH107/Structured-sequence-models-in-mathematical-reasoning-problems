    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5} (subtracting the intersection from the union)\n\nNow we need to find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and A:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A = ({1, 5} ∪ A) - ({1, 5} ∩ A)\n\n{1, 5} ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (union of {1, 5} and A)\n{1, 5} ∩ A = {1} (intersection of {1, 5} and A)\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A = {2, 3, 4, 5} (subtracting the intersection from the union)\n\nSo the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) ∆ A is {2, 3, 4, 5}."
