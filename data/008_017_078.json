    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first represent the given system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  5  0 |\n    | 0  4  7 |\n    | 0  6  3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    |  8 |\n    |  6 |\n\nNow, we can represent the matrix A as a sparse matrix by storing only the non-zero elements along with their row and column indices:\n\nSparse matrix representation of A:\n(0, 0, 2), (0, 1, 5), (1, 1, 4), (1, 2, 7), (2, 1, 6), (2, 2, 3)\n\nSince the matrix A is small and not very sparse, solving the system using sparse matrices does not provide significant computational advantages. However, we can still solve the system using Gaussian elimination or other standard methods.\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination, we can perform the following operations:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2 to make the leading coefficient 1:\n   R1 = R1 / 2\n\nA = | 1  2.5  0 |\n    | 0  4    7 |\n    | 0  6    3 |\n\n2. Eliminate the second and third row's second column by subtracting appropriate multiples of the first row:\n   R2 = R2 - 1.6 * R1\n   R3 = R3 - 2.4 * R1\n\nA = | 1  2.5  0   |\n    | 0  1    1.75|\n    | 0  0   -3   |\n\n3. Divide the third row by -3 to make the leading coefficient 1:\n   R3 = R3 / -3\n\nA = | 1  2.5  0   |\n    | 0  1    1.75|\n    | 0  0    1   |\n\n4. Eliminate the second row's third column by subtracting 1.75 times the third row:\n   R2 = R2 - 1.75 * R3\n\nA = | 1  2.5  0 |\n    | 0  1    0 |\n    | 0  0    1 |\n\n5. Eliminate the first row's second column by subtracting 2.5 times the second row:\n   R1 = R1 - 2.5 * R2\n\nA = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 0  1  0 |\n    | 0  0  1 |\n\nNow, we have the identity matrix, and we can find the solution by performing the same operations on the matrix B:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2:\n   R1 = R1 / 2\n\nB = | 5  |\n    | 8  |\n    | 6  |\n\n2. Eliminate the second and third row's second column:\n   R2 = R2 - 1.6 * R1\n   R3 = R3 - 2.4 * R1\n\nB = | 5  |\n    | -2 |\n    | -6 |\n\n3. Divide the third row by -3:\n   R3 = R3 / -3\n\nB = | 5  |\n    | -2 |\n    |  2 |\n\n4. Eliminate the second row's third column:\n   R2 = R2 - 1.75 * R3\n\nB = | 5  |\n    | -2 |\n    |  2 |\n\n5. Eliminate the first row's second column:\n   R1 = R1 - 2.5 * R2\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | -2 |\n    |  2 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 10\ny = -2\nz = 2"
