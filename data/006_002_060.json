    "message_1": "A fair six-sided dice is rolled once. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 3?",
    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided dice: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. To roll a number greater than 3, you can roll a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of the 6 possible outcomes. \n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2 or 50%."
