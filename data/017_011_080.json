    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p, if p^k is the highest power of p dividing the order of G (|G|), then G has a subgroup of order p^k, called a Sylow p-subgroup.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted n_p, divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let's apply these theorems to G, which has order 12. The prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3, so we will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have p = 2 and k = 2, so we are looking for subgroups of order 2^2 = 4. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 12/4 = 3, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 3.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have p = 3 and k = 1, so we are looking for subgroups of order 3^1 = 3. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 12/3 = 4, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G based on the values of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. Moreover, P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. By the direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is a cyclic group of order 12. In this case, G is isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Then, |G| = |P_2||P_3|/|P_2 ∩ P_3|, and G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. This case cannot occur, as it would imply that G has at least 1 + 4(2) = 9 distinct non-identity elements from the Sylow subgroups, which is not possible since |G| = 12.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. This case corresponds to the alternating group A4.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to C12, D6, or A4, depending on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the specific group G."
