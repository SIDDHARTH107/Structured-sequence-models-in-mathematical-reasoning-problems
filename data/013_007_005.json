    "message_1": "A group of 10 farmers share a plot of land to graze their cows. Each farmer has 5 cows. The plot of land can support a total of 40 cows. If any farmer exceeds their allotted 5 cows, the plot of land will be overgrazed, resulting in a loss of profit for everyone. Therefore, they must decide how many cows to graze on the plot of land. If each farmer adds one additional cow, they will earn an extra $1000 profit each. However, if all 10 farmers add an additional cow, the plot of land will be overgrazed and they will each lose $500. What should the farmers do to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation. Currently, there are 10 farmers with 5 cows each, which means there are 50 cows in total. The plot of land can support only 40 cows. So, they need to reduce the number of cows by 10 to avoid overgrazing.\n\nNow, let's consider the profit. If each farmer adds one additional cow, they will earn an extra $1000 profit each. However, if all 10 farmers add an additional cow, the plot of land will be overgrazed, and they will each lose $500.\n\nTo maximize their profit, the farmers should work together to decide which 10 cows to remove from the plot of land. Once they have reduced the number of cows to 40, they can then each add one additional cow, earning an extra $1000 profit each without overgrazing the land.\n\nIn this scenario, each farmer would have 6 cows on the plot of land, and the total number of cows would be 40. The farmers would maximize their profit by earning an extra $1000 each, for a total additional profit of $10,000."
