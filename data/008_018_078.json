    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the block matrix method, we first represent the system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 4  2  3 |\n    | 1  5 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n    | 3 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A_inv. Then, we can find the solution matrix X by multiplying A_inv with B: X = A_inv * B.\n\nTo find the inverse of A, we use the formula A_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nFirst, we find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 2(2(-2) - 3(3)) - 3(4(-2) - 1(3)) - 1(4(5) - 2(1))\n       = 2(-4 - 9) - 3(-8 - 3) - 1(20 - 2)\n       = 2(-13) + 3(11) - 18\n       = -26 + 33 - 18\n       = 7\n\nNow, we find the adjugate of A:\n\nadj(A) = | (2(-2) - 3(3))  -(4(-2) - 1(3))  (4(5) - 2(1))  |\n         | -(4(2) - 3(3))  (2(2) - 1(-1)) -(2(5) - 1(-2)) |\n         | (1(2) - 3(3))  -(1(-1) - 4(3))  (1(5) - 4(2))  |\n\nadj(A) = | -13  11  18 |\n         |  -2   5  -8 |\n         |  -7  -11  1 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of A:\n\nA_inv = (1/7) * adj(A)\n\nA_inv = | -13/7  11/7  18/7  |\n        | -2/7   5/7  -8/7  |\n        | -1    -11/7  1/7  |\n\nFinally, we find the solution matrix X:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = | -13/7  11/7  18/7  |  | 1 |\n    | -2/7   5/7  -8/7  |  | 2 |\n    | -1    -11/7  1/7  |  | 3 |\n\nX = | (1)(-13/7) + (2)(11/7) + (3)(18/7)  |\n    | (1)(-2/7) + (2)(5/7) + (3)(-8/7)    |\n    | (1)(-1) + (2)(-11/7) + (3)(1/7)     |\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | 0 |\n    | 1 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 0, and z = 1."
