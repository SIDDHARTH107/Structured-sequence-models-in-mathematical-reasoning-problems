However, they notice that one student has a height that is significantly different from the other measurements. Using robust statistics, they want to find the median height of the remaining 9 students. \n\nHere are the 10 height measurements (in inches): \n\n{63, 61, 64, 65, 61, 63, 62, 61, 68, 58} \n\nWhat is the median height of the remaining 9 students after removing the outlier?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to identify the outlier. In this case, the outlier is the height that is significantly different from the other measurements. Looking at the data, we can see that the height 58 inches is significantly lower than the rest of the measurements. So, we will remove this value from the dataset.\n\nThe remaining 9 height measurements are:\n\n{63, 61, 64, 65, 61, 63, 62, 61, 68}\n\nNow, we need to find the median of these 9 values. To do this, we first arrange the values in ascending order:\n\n{61, 61, 61, 62, 63, 63, 64, 65, 68}\n\nSince there are 9 values, the median will be the middle value, which is the 5th value in the ordered list. In this case, the median height is 63 inches."
