    "message_2": "To find the union of A and its complement, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since the problem does not specify the universal set, we will assume that U contains all the integers from 1 to 10 for simplicity. So, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A, denoted as A'. A' contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. So, A' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNext, we find the union of A and A', denoted as A ∪ A'. The union of two sets contains all the elements that are in either of the sets. In this case, A ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∪ A' is the universal set U. By definition, the universal set contains all the elements under consideration. Since A ∪ A' contains all the elements from 1 to 10, it is equal to the universal set U.\n\nTherefore, A ∪ A' = U, and we have proved that the union of A and its complement is the universal set."
