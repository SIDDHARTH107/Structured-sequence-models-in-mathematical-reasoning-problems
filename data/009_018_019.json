    "message_2": "To solve this nonlinear differential equation, we can first rewrite it as a separable equation:\n\n$y' = -\\sin(y)$\n\nNow, separate the variables:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\sin(y)$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{\\sin(y)} = -dx$\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n$\\int \\frac{dy}{\\sin(y)} = -\\int dx$\n\nTo evaluate the integral on the left side, we can use the substitution method. Let $u = \\cos(y)$, so $du = -\\sin(y) dy$. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n$\\int \\frac{-du}{u} = -\\int dx$\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n$-\\ln|u| = -x + C$\n\n$-\\ln|\\cos(y)| = -x + C$\n\nNow, we can solve for the initial condition $y(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$:\n\n$-\\ln|\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4})| = -0 + C$\n\n$-\\ln|\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}| = C$\n\n$C = \\ln(2) - \\ln(\\sqrt{2})$\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\n$-\\ln|\\cos(y)| = -x + \\ln(2) - \\ln(\\sqrt{2})$\n\nTo find the value of $y$ at $x = 4\\pi$, we can plug in the value of $x$:\n\n$-\\ln|\\cos(y)| = -4\\pi + \\ln(2) - \\ln(\\sqrt{2})$\n\nUnfortunately, this equation cannot be solved analytically for $y$. However, we can use numerical methods (such as Newton's method or Runge-Kutta methods) to approximate the value of $y$ at $x = 4\\pi$."
