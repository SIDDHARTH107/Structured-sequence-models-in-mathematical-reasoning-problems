    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to provide a numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic as it is a non-classical logic that deals with contradictions and allows for the existence of conflicting propositions. The questions related to paraconsistent logic are mostly philosophical or conceptual in nature and don't involve numerical calculations. Could you please provide more details about the topic or provide a different subtopic so that I can assist you better?",
    "message_2": "If you have a different mathematical problem or topic you'd like me to help with, please feel free to provide the details, and I'll be more than happy to assist you."
