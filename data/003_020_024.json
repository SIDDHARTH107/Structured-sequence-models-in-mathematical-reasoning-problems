    "message_1": "A plane is flying at a height of 5,000 feet above the ground. At a certain moment, the pilot sees a landmark on the ground at an angle of depression of 30 degrees. How far away is the landmark from the plane? Round your answer to the nearest foot.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We will consider a right triangle formed by the plane, the landmark, and the point on the ground directly below the plane. The angle of depression is the angle between the line of sight from the plane to the landmark and the horizontal line parallel to the ground.\n\nIn this case, the angle of depression is 30 degrees. Since the angle of depression is equal to the angle of elevation from the ground to the plane, we can use the tangent function to find the distance between the plane and the landmark.\n\nLet's denote the distance from the plane to the landmark as x and the distance from the point on the ground directly below the plane to the landmark as y. We have:\n\ntan(30°) = (5,000 feet) / y\n\nSince tan(30°) = 1 / √3, we can write:\n\n1 / √3 = 5,000 / y\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 5,000 * √3\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the plane and the landmark (x):\n\nx^2 = (5,000 feet)^2 + y^2\n\nx^2 = 25,000,000 + (5,000 * √3)^2\n\nx^2 = 25,000,000 + 75,000,000\n\nx^2 = 100,000,000\n\nx = √100,000,000\n\nx ≈ 10,000 feet\n\nSo, the landmark is approximately 10,000 feet away from the plane."
