    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly removing triangles from an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the number of triangles removed is equal to the number of triangles in the previous iteration. \n\nIn the first iteration, there is 1 triangle (the original equilateral triangle). In the second iteration, 3 triangles are formed by removing the central triangle from the original triangle. In the third iteration, 3 triangles are removed from each of the 3 triangles in the second iteration, resulting in 9 triangles.\n\nIn general, the number of triangles in the nth iteration of the Sierpinski sieve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^(n-1)\n\nFor the 8th iteration, the number of triangles is:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^(8-1) = 3^7 = 2187 triangles."
