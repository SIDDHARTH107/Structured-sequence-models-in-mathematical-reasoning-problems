    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between any pair of vertices. We can achieve this by removing edges in such a way that at least one vertex becomes isolated (i.e., it has no edges connecting it to any other vertex).\n\nIn this graph, we can disconnect it by removing the following edges: AB, AC, and CE. After removing these edges, vertex A and vertex E will be isolated, and the graph will be disconnected.\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 3."
