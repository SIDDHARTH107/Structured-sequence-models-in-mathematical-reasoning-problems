    "message_2": "Let U be the universal set such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. \n\nLet A be a subset of U such that A = {2, 4, 6, 8}. \n\nTo find the complement of A (A'), we need to find all the elements in U that are not in A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nA ∪ A' = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A or x ∈ A'}\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can see that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U\n\nThis is true because, by definition, the complement of a set contains all elements that are not in the original set. Therefore, when we take the union of a set and its complement, we are essentially combining all the elements in the universal set. In set theory notation, for any set A and its complement A':\n\nA ∪ A' = U"
