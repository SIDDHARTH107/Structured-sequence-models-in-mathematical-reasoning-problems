    "message_1": "A company wants to analyze customer preferences for their products based on age, income and education level. The company collected data from a survey of 500 customers. The dataset includes 3 variables (age, income and education level) with 500 observations. Using principal component analysis, determine the number of principal components that accurately captures the majority of the variation in the data.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of principal components that accurately capture the majority of the variation in the data, we need to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset and analyze the explained variance ratio of each component.\n\nSince we have 3 variables (age, income, and education level), PCA will generate 3 principal components. The explained variance ratio tells us the proportion of the total variance in the dataset that is explained by each principal component.\n\nAfter performing PCA on the dataset, we will look at the explained variance ratios for each component. A common rule of thumb is to select the number of components that together explain at least 70-80% of the total variance in the dataset.\n\nFor example, let's say the explained variance ratios for the 3 principal components are as follows:\n\n1. Principal Component 1: 0.55 (55%)\n2. Principal Component 2: 0.30 (30%)\n3. Principal Component 3: 0.15 (15%)\n\nIn this case, the first two principal components together explain 85% (55% + 30%) of the total variance in the dataset. Therefore, we can conclude that 2 principal components accurately capture the majority of the variation in the data.\n\nPlease note that this example is hypothetical, and you would need to perform PCA on the actual dataset to determine the number of principal components that accurately capture the majority of the variation in your specific data."
