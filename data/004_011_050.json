    "message_1": "A hot air balloon is rising vertically and its height above the ground at time t is given by h(t) = 50 + 30t^(2), where t is measured in minutes and h is measured in meters. At what rate is the balloon rising after 4 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To find the rate at which the balloon is rising after 4 minutes, we need to find the derivative of the height function h(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the rate of change of height with respect to time, which is the speed at which the balloon is rising.\n\nThe height function is h(t) = 50 + 30t^2. To find its derivative, we'll use the power rule for differentiation:\n\ndh/dt = d(50 + 30t^2)/dt = 0 + 60t\n\nNow, we want to find the rate at which the balloon is rising after 4 minutes, so we'll plug t = 4 into the derivative:\n\ndh/dt = 60(4) = 240\n\nSo, after 4 minutes, the balloon is rising at a rate of 240 meters per minute."
