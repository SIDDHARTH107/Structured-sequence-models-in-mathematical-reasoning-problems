    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given group G. Since the operation is defined as a^i * a^j = a^(i+j), it is clear that G is a cyclic group of order 36, generated by the element a. In a cyclic group, every element can be expressed as a power of the generator, and the group is abelian.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to determine which of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36 is isomorphic to G. Since G is an abelian group, it cannot be isomorphic to any non-abelian group. Therefore, there is no non-abelian group of order 36 that is isomorphic to the given group G."
