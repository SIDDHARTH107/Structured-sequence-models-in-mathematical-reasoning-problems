    "message_2": "To prove that X is a Hausdorff space, we need to show that for every distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nLet x and y be two distinct points in X. Since x ≠ y, the set {x, y} is a closed set in X (as it is a finite set). By the given property, {x, y} can be expressed as a finite union of compact sets. Let's denote these compact sets as K1, K2, ..., Kn.\n\nNow, we claim that at least one of these compact sets, say K1, does not contain both x and y. If all the compact sets contained both x and y, then their intersection would also contain both x and y. However, the intersection of all these compact sets is equal to the closed set {x, y}, which is a contradiction since x and y are distinct points.\n\nSo, without loss of generality, let's assume that x ∈ K1 and y ∉ K1. Since K1 is compact, it is also closed. Therefore, its complement, X \\ K1, is an open set containing y.\n\nNow, we have two disjoint closed sets: {x} and X \\ (K1 ∪ {x}). Since X has the property that every closed set is a finite union of compact sets, there exist compact sets C1, C2, ..., Cm such that X \\ (K1 ∪ {x}) = C1 ∪ C2 ∪ ... ∪ Cm.\n\nSince K1 and the Ci's are compact, and x ∈ K1, there exist open sets U and V1, V2, ..., Vm such that x ∈ U, K1 ⊆ U, and Ci ⊆ Vi for all i = 1, 2, ..., m. Let V = V1 ∩ V2 ∩ ... ∩ Vm. Then, V is an open set containing y, as y ∈ X \\ K1.\n\nNow, we show that U ∩ V = ∅. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a point z ∈ U ∩ V. Then, z ∈ U and z ∈ Vi for all i = 1, 2, ..., m. Since K1 ⊆ U and Ci ⊆ Vi, it follows that z ∈ K1 ∪ C1 ∪ C2 ∪ ... ∪ Cm. But this contradicts the fact that z ∈ X \\ (K1 ∪ {x}), as X \\ (K1 ∪ {x}) = C1 ∪ C2 ∪ ... ∪ Cm.\n\nTherefore, U ∩ V = ∅, and we have found open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. This proves that X is a Hausdorff space."
