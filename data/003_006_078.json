    "message_1": "A triangle has one angle of 60 degrees and a side opposite to it measures 4 units. The angle opposite to a second side measures 45 degrees and the third angle is 75 degrees. Find the lengths of the other two sides using the law of sines.",
    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, where angle A is 60 degrees, angle B is 45 degrees, and angle C is 75 degrees. Let side a be opposite angle A, side b be opposite angle B, and side c be opposite angle C. We are given that side a = 4 units.\n\nUsing the law of sines, we have:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe want to find the lengths of sides b and c. We can use the given information and the law of sines to set up two equations:\n\nb/sin(45) = 4/sin(60)\nc/sin(75) = 4/sin(60)\n\nNow, we can solve for b and c:\n\nb = (4 * sin(45))/sin(60)\nc = (4 * sin(75))/sin(60)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values:\n\nb = (4 * 0.7071)/0.8660 ≈ 3.25\nc = (4 * 0.9659)/0.8660 ≈ 4.47\n\nSo, the lengths of the other two sides are approximately 3.25 units and 4.47 units."
