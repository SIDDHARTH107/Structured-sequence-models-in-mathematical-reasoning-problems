Determine the number of possible permutations of the blocks of size 3 that could have been used in the encryption process.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible permutations of the blocks of size 3 that could have been used in the encryption process, we first need to understand how the transposition cipher works.\n\nIn a transposition cipher with a fixed-length block of size 3, the plaintext message is divided into blocks of 3 characters each. Then, the characters within each block are rearranged according to a specific permutation. In this case, the plaintext message \"HELLOWORLD\" is divided into the following blocks:\n\n1. HEL\n2. LOW\n3. ORL\n4. D (with two padding characters added, e.g., DD)\n\nThe ciphertext \"HOEOLLRDLW\" is obtained by applying a permutation to each block. We can see that the blocks have been rearranged as follows:\n\n1. HOE (from HEL)\n2. OLL (from LOW)\n3. RDL (from ORL)\n4. W (from D, with padding characters removed)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of possible permutations of the blocks of size 3. Since there are 3 characters in each block, there are 3! (3 factorial) possible permutations for each block. 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 possible permutations of the blocks of size 3 that could have been used in the encryption process."
