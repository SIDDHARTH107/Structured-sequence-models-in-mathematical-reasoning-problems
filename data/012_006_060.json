    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once, and an Eulerian circuit is an Eulerian path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has an even degree (number of edges incident to it), and it has an Eulerian path if and only if exactly 0 or 2 vertices have an odd degree.\n\nLet's label the vertices of the given graph as A, B, C, D, and E, clockwise starting from the top vertex. The degrees of the vertices are as follows:\n\nA: degree 3 (odd)\nB: degree 3 (odd)\nC: degree 2 (even)\nD: degree 4 (even)\nE: degree 2 (even)\n\nSince there are exactly 2 vertices with odd degrees (A and B), the graph has an Eulerian path. However, it does not have an Eulerian circuit since not all vertices have even degrees.\n\nOne possible Eulerian path is: A-B-C-D-E-A-D-B.\n\nA Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once, and a Hamiltonian circuit is a Hamiltonian path that starts and ends at the same vertex.\n\nThe given graph has a Hamiltonian circuit. One possible Hamiltonian circuit is: A-B-C-D-E-A.\n\nIn summary, the graph has an Eulerian path (A-B-C-D-E-A-D-B) and a Hamiltonian circuit (A-B-C-D-E-A)."
