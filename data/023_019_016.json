    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nLet's denote the Fourier transform of y(t) as Y(ω), y'(t) as Y'(ω), and y''(t) as Y''(ω). Then, the Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\nY''(ω) + 2Y'(ω) + 2Y(ω) = F_cos(3t)\n\nwhere F_cos(3t) is the Fourier transform of cos(3t).\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of cos(3t):\n\nF_cos(3t) = ∫[cos(3t) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n          = ∫[cos(3t) * (cos(-ωt) + i*sin(-ωt))] dt\n          = ∫[cos(3t) * cos(ωt)] dt - i∫[cos(3t) * sin(ωt)] dt\n\nUsing integration by parts and simplifying, we get:\n\nF_cos(3t) = (π/2) * [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we have the transformed differential equation:\n\nY''(ω) + 2Y'(ω) + 2Y(ω) = (π/2) * [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]\n\nTo solve for Y(ω), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nY(ω) = -Y''(ω)/2 - Y'(ω) + (π/4) * [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get the general solution y(t):\n\ny(t) = F^(-1)[Y(ω)]\n\ny(t) = F^(-1)[-Y''(ω)/2 - Y'(ω) + (π/4) * [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]]\n\nUsing the inverse Fourier transform properties and linearity, we can write:\n\ny(t) = -F^(-1)[Y''(ω)/2] - F^(-1)[Y'(ω)] + (π/4) * [F^(-1)[δ(ω - 3)] + F^(-1)[δ(ω + 3)]]\n\nSince the inverse Fourier transform of a Dirac delta function is a complex exponential, we have:\n\ny(t) = -F^(-1)[Y''(ω)/2] - F^(-1)[Y'(ω)] + (π/4) * [e^(3it) + e^(-3it)]\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transforms of -Y''(ω)/2 and -Y'(ω) using the initial conditions. However, since we don't have any initial conditions given, we will leave the general solution in this form:\n\ny(t) = -F^(-1)[Y''(ω)/2] - F^(-1)[Y'(ω)] + (π/4) * [e^(3it) + e^(-3it)]\n\nTo determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the characteristic equation of the homogeneous part of the differential equation:\n\nr^2 + 2r + 2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots:\n\nr = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4*2))/2 = -1 ± i\n\nSince the real part of the roots is negative, the system is stable."
