Show that there exists some real number $c$ and a vector field $v: M \\rightarrow TM$ such that $\\|\\text{d}s(x)(v(x))\\| = c$ for all $x \\in M$.",
    "message_2": "Since $s$ is a nowhere vanishing section, we can normalize it to obtain a unit section $\\tilde{s} = \\frac{s}{\\|s\\|}$. Now, consider the map $f: M \\rightarrow E$ defined by $f(x) = \\|\\text{d}\\tilde{s}(x)\\|$. Since $M$ is compact, $f$ attains its maximum at some point $x_0 \\in M$. Let $c = f(x_0)$. We will show that there exists a vector field $v: M \\rightarrow TM$ such that $\\|\\text{d}s(x)(v(x))\\| = c$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nAt each point $x \\in M$, the differential $\\text{d}\\tilde{s}(x)$ is a linear map from $T_xM$ to $E_x$. Since $E$ has rank $r > 0$, the image of $\\text{d}\\tilde{s}(x)$ is nontrivial. Therefore, there exists a nonzero vector $v(x) \\in T_xM$ such that $\\|\\text{d}\\tilde{s}(x)(v(x))\\| = f(x)$. Define the vector field $v: M \\rightarrow TM$ by $v(x) = \\frac{v(x)}{\\|v(x)\\|}$.\n\nNow, we will show that $\\|\\text{d}s(x)(v(x))\\| = c$ for all $x \\in M$. Since $f(x) \\leq c$ for all $x \\in M$, we have $\\|\\text{d}\\tilde{s}(x)(v(x))\\| \\leq c$. On the other hand, at the point $x_0$ where $f$ attains its maximum, we have $\\|\\text{d}\\tilde{s}(x_0)(v(x_0))\\| = c$. Therefore, $\\|\\text{d}s(x)(v(x))\\| = \\|\\text{d}\\tilde{s}(x)(v(x))\\| \\cdot \\|s(x)\\| \\geq c$ for all $x \\in M$. Combining these inequalities, we conclude that $\\|\\text{d}s(x)(v(x))\\| = c$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nThus, we have constructed a vector field $v: M \\rightarrow TM$ such that $\\|\\text{d}s(x)(v(x))\\| = c$ for all $x \\in M$."
