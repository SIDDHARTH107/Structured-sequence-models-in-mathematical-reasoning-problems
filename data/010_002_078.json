    "message_2": "Proof that the limit function f is continuous on X:\n\nLet ε > 0 be given. Since fn(x) converges to f(x) for all x in X, we know that for each x in X, there exists N_x such that for all n ≥ N_x, |fn(x) - f(x)| < ε/3. Since fn are continuous, there exists δ_x > 0 such that for all y in X with d(x, y) < δ_x, |fn(y) - fn(x)| < ε/3.\n\nNow, let x, y be in X with d(x, y) < δ_x. Then, for all n ≥ N_x, we have:\n\n|f(y) - f(x)| ≤ |f(y) - fn(y)| + |fn(y) - fn(x)| + |fn(x) - f(x)| < ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε.\n\nThus, f is continuous on X.\n\nNow, let's consider the numerical example:\n\nLet X be the interval [0,1] with the usual Euclidean metric and fn(x) = sin(nπx). We want to show that fn(x) converges uniformly to the zero function, and hence, the limit function f(x) = 0 is continuous on [0,1].\n\nFirst, we observe that |fn(x)| = |sin(nπx)| ≤ 1 for all n and x in X, so the sequence {fn} is uniformly bounded by M = 1.\n\nNow, let ε > 0 be given. We want to show that there exists N such that for all n ≥ N and all x in X, |fn(x) - 0| < ε. Since ε > 0, we can choose N = ⌈1/(ε/π)⌉, where ⌈x⌉ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.\n\nNow, let n ≥ N and x in X. We have:\n\n|fn(x) - 0| = |sin(nπx)| = |sin(π(n - k)/x)|, where k = ⌊nπx⌋ is the largest integer less than or equal to nπx.\n\nSince 0 ≤ (n - k)/x < 1/(ε/π), we have:\n\n|sin(π(n - k)/x)| ≤ π(n - k)/x < ε.\n\nThus, fn(x) converges uniformly to the zero function on X. Since we have already shown that the limit function f is continuous on X, we conclude that the limit function f(x) = 0 is continuous on [0,1]."
