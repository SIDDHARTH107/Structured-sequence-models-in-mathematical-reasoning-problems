    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given partial differential equation, we first need to express the derivative with respect to the complex conjugate $\\bar{z}$ in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$. Recall that:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given partial differential equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + i \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0$$\n\nThis equation can be separated into its real and imaginary parts:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$$\n\nThese equations tell us that the function $u(x, y)$ is constant with respect to both $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the general solution of the partial differential equation is:\n\n$$u(x, y) = C$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a complex constant."
