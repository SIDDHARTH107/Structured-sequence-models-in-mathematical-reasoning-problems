    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot competition between two firms. Firm 1 has a cost function of C1 = 200 + 2Q1, where Q1 is the quantity produced by firm 1, and Firm 2 has a cost function of C2 = 150 + 3Q2, where Q2 is the quantity produced by firm 2. The market demand function is P = 100 - Q, where P is the product price and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. \n\nWhat will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm, and what will be the market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm and the market price, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nFirst, let's find the profit functions for both firms:\n\nπ1 = P * Q1 - C1 = (100 - Q) * Q1 - (200 + 2Q1)\nπ2 = P * Q2 - C2 = (100 - Q) * Q2 - (150 + 3Q2)\n\nSince Q = Q1 + Q2, we can rewrite the profit functions as:\n\nπ1 = (100 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q1 - (200 + 2Q1)\nπ2 = (100 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2 - (150 + 3Q2)\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order conditions (FOC) by taking the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to each firm's quantity:\n\n∂π1/∂Q1 = 100 - 2Q1 - Q2 - 2 = 0\n∂π2/∂Q2 = 100 - Q1 - 2Q2 - 3 = 0\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (Q1 and Q2):\n\n98 - 2Q1 - Q2 = 0\n97 - Q1 - 2Q2 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find the equilibrium quantities for both firms:\n\nQ1 = 34\nQ2 = 31.5\n\nNow, we can find the total quantity produced (Q) and the market price (P):\n\nQ = Q1 + Q2 = 34 + 31.5 = 65.5\nP = 100 - Q = 100 - 65.5 = 34.5\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity produced by Firm 1 is 34, the equilibrium quantity produced by Firm 2 is 31.5, and the market price is 34.5."
