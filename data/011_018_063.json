    "message_1": "In a block design, there are 10 different treatments and 6 blocks, each of which contains exactly 3 treatments. How many blocks are needed if each pair of treatments appears together in exactly one block?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the formula for the number of blocks needed in a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD):\n\nv(v - 1) = b * k(k - 1)\n\nwhere v is the number of treatments, b is the number of blocks, and k is the number of treatments per block.\n\nIn this problem, we have v = 10 treatments, and k = 3 treatments per block. We want to find the value of b (the number of blocks needed) such that each pair of treatments appears together in exactly one block.\n\n10(10 - 1) = b * 3(3 - 1)\n\n90 = b * 6\n\nb = 90 / 6\n\nb = 15\n\nSo, 15 blocks are needed if each pair of treatments appears together in exactly one block."
