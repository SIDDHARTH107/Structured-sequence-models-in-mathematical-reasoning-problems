    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (5x² - 4x + 1)/(3x - 2) using the quotient rule, we first identify the numerator function as u(x) = 5x² - 4x + 1 and the denominator function as v(x) = 3x - 2.\n\nThe quotient rule states that the derivative of a quotient of two functions is given by:\n\n(f(x))' = (u(x)/v(x))' = (v(x) * u'(x) - u(x) * v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nNow, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(5x² - 4x + 1)/dx = 10x - 4\nv'(x) = d(3x - 2)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = ((3x - 2) * (10x - 4) - (5x² - 4x + 1) * 3) / (3x - 2)^2\n\nf'(x) = (30x² - 20x - 8x + 4 - 15x² + 12x - 3) / (9x² - 12x + 4)\n\nf'(x) = (15x² - 16x + 1) / (9x² - 12x + 4)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (5x² - 4x + 1)/(3x - 2) is f'(x) = (15x² - 16x + 1) / (9x² - 12x + 4)."
