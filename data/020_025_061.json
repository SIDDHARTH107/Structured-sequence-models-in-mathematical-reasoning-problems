    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance the truck can travel to deliver all packages to the customers, we can use the traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithm. However, since the truck can carry a maximum of 3 packages at a time, we need to modify the TSP algorithm to account for this constraint. We can do this by dividing the customers into groups of 3 and then finding the shortest route for each group.\n\nHere's one way to divide the customers into groups of 3 and find the shortest route for each group:\n\nGroup 1: Customers 1, 2, and 3\nGroup 2: Customers 4, 5, and 6\nGroup 3: Customer 7 (since there are only 7 customers, the last group will have only 1 customer)\n\nNow, let's find the shortest route for each group:\n\nGroup 1: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 (8 + 7 + 10 = 25 km)\nGroup 2: 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 1 (12 + 8 + 18 + 5 = 43 km)\nGroup 3: 1 -> 7 -> 1 (20 + 20 = 40 km)\n\nThe total shortest distance for the truck to travel to deliver all packages to the customers is 25 + 43 + 40 = 108 km."
