    "message_2": "To find the value of arccos(0.5), we need to determine the angle whose cosine is 0.5. \n\nRecall that the cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In this case, we are looking for an angle whose cosine is 0.5, or:\n\ncos(angle) = 0.5\n\nOne such angle is 60 degrees or π/3 radians. This is because in an equilateral triangle, if we draw an altitude, it bisects the base and creates two 30-60-90 right triangles. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the adjacent side (half the base) to the hypotenuse (one side of the equilateral triangle) is 0.5.\n\nTherefore, arccos(0.5) = 60 degrees or π/3 radians."
