    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the given information: the historical data shows that financial fraud occurs in 5% of all companies annually. We are not given any specific information about the company with 100 employees, so we will assume that it is a typical company.\n\nSince financial fraud occurs in 5% of all companies annually, the probability of a financial fraud occurrence in a company with 100 employees is also 5% or 0.05."
