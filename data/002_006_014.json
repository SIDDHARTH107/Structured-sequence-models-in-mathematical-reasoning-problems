    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius of the circular pond is 8 meters.\n\nC = 2π(8)\nC = 16π\n\nThe circumference of the circular pond is 16π meters, which is approximately 50.27 meters."
