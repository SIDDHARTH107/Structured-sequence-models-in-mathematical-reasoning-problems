    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector 𝑣 onto vector 𝑢 using trigonometry, we'll first find the angle between the two vectors, and then use the dot product formula to find the projection.\n\nStep 1: Find the angle between vectors 𝑣 and 𝑢.\nWe can use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (𝑣 • 𝑢) / (||𝑣|| ||𝑢||)\n\nwhere 𝑣 • 𝑢 is the dot product of 𝑣 and 𝑢, and ||𝑣|| and ||𝑢|| are the magnitudes of 𝑣 and 𝑢, respectively.\n\nFirst, find the dot product of 𝑣 and 𝑢:\n𝑣 • 𝑢 = (3 * 1) + (4 * 2) = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nNext, find the magnitudes of 𝑣 and 𝑢:\n||𝑣|| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n||𝑢|| = √(1² + 2²) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n\nNow, find the cosine of the angle between 𝑣 and 𝑢:\ncos(θ) = (11) / (5 * √5)\n\nStep 2: Find the projection of 𝑣 onto 𝑢.\nThe projection of 𝑣 onto 𝑢, denoted as proj_𝑢(𝑣), can be found using the following formula:\n\nproj_𝑢(𝑣) = (𝑣 • 𝑢) / ||𝑢||² * 𝑢\n\nWe already found 𝑣 • 𝑢 = 11 and ||𝑢|| = √5. Now, find ||𝑢||²:\n||𝑢||² = (√5)² = 5\n\nNow, find the projection of 𝑣 onto 𝑢:\nproj_𝑢(𝑣) = (11) / (5) * 𝑢 = (11/5) * (1, 2) = (11/5, 22/5)\n\nSo, the projection of vector 𝑣=(3,4) onto vector 𝑢=(1,2) is proj_𝑢(𝑣) = (11/5, 22/5)."
