    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| on the boundary of C, we will first parametrize the unit circle using the complex exponential function. Let z = e^(it), where t is a real parameter and 0 ≤ t < 2π. Then, we can rewrite f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = f(e^(it)) = (e^(it))^3 + 2(e^(it))^2 + 3(e^(it)) - 2\n= e^(3it) + 2e^(2it) + 3e^(it) - 2\n\nNow, we will find the magnitude of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |e^(3it) + 2e^(2it) + 3e^(it) - 2|\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|, we can consider the real and imaginary parts of f(z) separately. Let f(z) = u(t) + iv(t), where u(t) and v(t) are the real and imaginary parts of f(z), respectively. Then,\n\nu(t) = Re(f(z)) = cos(3t) + 2cos(2t) + 3cos(t) - 2\nv(t) = Im(f(z)) = sin(3t) + 2sin(2t) + 3sin(t)\n\nNow, we will find the derivatives of u(t) and v(t) with respect to t:\n\nu'(t) = -3sin(3t) - 4sin(2t) - 3sin(t)\nv'(t) = 3cos(3t) + 4cos(2t) + 3cos(t)\n\nTo find the critical points of |f(z)|, we will look for the points where both u'(t) and v'(t) are zero:\n\n-3sin(3t) - 4sin(2t) - 3sin(t) = 0\n3cos(3t) + 4cos(2t) + 3cos(t) = 0\n\nWe can solve this system of equations numerically to find the values of t that correspond to the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|. Using a numerical solver, we find that the critical points occur at approximately t = 0.388, 2.753, and 4.961.\n\nNow, we can evaluate |f(z)| at these critical points:\n\n|f(0.388)| ≈ 3.243\n|f(2.753)| ≈ 0.757\n|f(4.961)| ≈ 3.243\n\nThus, the maximum value of |f(z)| on the boundary of C is approximately 3.243, and the minimum value is approximately 0.757."
