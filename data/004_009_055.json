    "message_2": "To find the derivative of $h(x) = f(x)g(x)$, we will use the product rule, which states that $(fg)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$. First, we need to find the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x) = x^2 + 3x$ is $f'(x) = 2x + 3$.\n\nThe derivative of $g(x) = \\sin x$ is $g'(x) = \\cos x$.\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\n$h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) = (2x + 3)\\sin x + (x^2 + 3x)\\cos x$.\n\nTo find the derivative of $h(x)$ at $x = 0$, we substitute $x = 0$ into the expression for $h'(x)$:\n\n$h'(0) = (2(0) + 3)\\sin(0) + (0^2 + 3(0))\\cos(0) = 3\\cdot 0 + 0\\cdot 1 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the derivative of $h(x) = f(x)g(x)$ at $x = 0$ is $0$."
