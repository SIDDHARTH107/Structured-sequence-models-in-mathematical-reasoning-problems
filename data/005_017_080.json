    "message_1": "A company produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The company's sales data for the last quarter shows that product A sold 800 units, product B sold 600 units, and product C sold 400 units. Using principal component analysis, calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the sales data matrix.",
    "message_2": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction and is typically applied to a dataset with multiple variables. In this case, we only have one variable (sales data) for each product type. Therefore, PCA is not applicable to this problem.\n\nHowever, if you have more variables (e.g., sales data for multiple quarters or additional features like price, production cost, etc.), you can create a dataset matrix and then apply PCA to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nIf you provide more data or clarify the problem, I'd be happy to help you with the calculations."
