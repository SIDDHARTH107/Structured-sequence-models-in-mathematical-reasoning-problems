    "message_2": "To find the value of Euler's totient function φ(n) for the number 21, we first need to find the prime factors of 21. \n\n21 = 3 × 7 (both 3 and 7 are prime numbers)\n\nNow, we will use the formula for Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n × (1 - 1/p1) × (1 - 1/p2) × ... × (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn our case, n = 21, p1 = 3, and p2 = 7.\n\nφ(21) = 21 × (1 - 1/3) × (1 - 1/7)\nφ(21) = 21 × (2/3) × (6/7)\nφ(21) = 21 × (2 × 6) / (3 × 7)\nφ(21) = 21 × 12 / 21\nφ(21) = 12\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function φ(21) is 12."
