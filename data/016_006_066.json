    "message_2": "To find the probability of a randomly selected point in the Barnsley fern falling within the smallest bounding box that contains the stem of the fern, we need to analyze the given affine transformations and their probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's identify which transformation corresponds to the stem of the fern. The stem is the vertical part of the fern, and it is generated by the transformation with the smallest scaling factor in the x-direction. In this case, that transformation is f1(x, y) = (0, 0.16y) with a probability of P1 = 0.01.\n\nNow, let's find the smallest bounding box that contains the stem of the fern. Since the stem is generated by the transformation f1(x, y), we can find the bounding box by applying this transformation to the entire fern. The transformation f1(x, y) scales the x-coordinate by 0 and the y-coordinate by 0.16, so the bounding box will have a width of 0 and a height that is 0.16 times the height of the entire fern.\n\nHowever, since the width of the bounding box is 0, the probability of a randomly selected point falling within this bounding box is also 0. This is because the area of the bounding box is 0 (area = width × height), and the probability of a point falling within a region is proportional to the area of that region.\n\nTherefore, the probability of a randomly selected point in the Barnsley fern falling within the smallest bounding box that contains the stem of the fern is 0.00."
