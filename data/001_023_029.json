    "message_2": "To solve the given equation, we can use the double angle formula for sine, which is sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So, the equation becomes:\n\n2(2sin(x)cos(x)) + √3cos(x) = 2\n\nNow, we can factor out cos(x):\n\ncos(x)(4sin(x) + √3) = 2\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: cos(x) = 0\nThis occurs when x = π/2 or x = 3π/2.\n\nCase 2: 4sin(x) + √3 = 2\nIn this case, we have:\n\n4sin(x) = 2 - √3\nsin(x) = (2 - √3)/4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the range 0 ≤ x < 2π that satisfy this equation. Using the arcsin function:\n\nx = arcsin((2 - √3)/4)\n\nHowever, since the range of arcsin is -π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2, we need to find the other angle in the range 0 ≤ x < 2π that has the same sine value. This can be done by using the formula:\n\nx = π - arcsin((2 - √3)/4)\n\nNow, we have the two solutions for x in the range 0 ≤ x < 2π:\n\nx = arcsin((2 - √3)/4)\nx = π - arcsin((2 - √3)/4)\n\nIn conclusion, the solutions for x in the given equation are:\n\nx = π/2, 3π/2, arcsin((2 - √3)/4), and π - arcsin((2 - √3)/4)."
