    "message_2": "Yes, a perfect matching exists in this graph. A perfect matching is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex.\n\nThe set of edges forming the perfect matching in this graph is:\n\n{(A, D), (B, E), (C, F)}\n\nThis set of edges connects every vertex exactly once, and no two edges share a vertex."
