    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the curves y = 2x - x^2 and y = x about the y-axis, we will use the method of cylindrical shells. The formula for the volume of a cylindrical shell is V = ∫[2π * radius * height] dx, where we integrate with respect to x over the interval [a, b].\n\nFirst, we need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n2x - x^2 = x\n\nx^2 = x\n\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nx = 0 or x = 1\n\nSo, the points of intersection are (0, 0) and (1, 1). These points will be our limits of integration.\n\nNext, we need to find the expressions for the radius and height of the cylindrical shells. The radius is the distance from the y-axis to the curve, which is simply x. The height of the shell is the difference between the two curves:\n\nheight = (2x - x^2) - x\n\nNow we can set up the integral:\n\nV = ∫[2π * x * ((2x - x^2) - x)] dx from 0 to 1\n\nV = 2π * ∫[x(2x - x^2 - x)] dx from 0 to 1\n\nV = 2π * ∫[x(2x - x^2 - x)] dx from 0 to 1\n\nV = 2π * ∫[x(x^2 - 2x)] dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow we integrate:\n\nV = 2π * [(-1/4)x^4 + (x^3)/3] from 0 to 1\n\nNow we evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nV = 2π * [((-1/4)(1)^4 + (1^3)/3) - ((-1/4)(0)^4 + (0^3)/3)]\n\nV = 2π * [((-1/4) + 1/3)]\n\nV = 2π * [(3 - 4)/12]\n\nV = 2π * (-1/12)\n\nV = -π/6\n\nSince the volume cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nV = π/6\n\nSo, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the curves y = 2x - x^2 and y = x about the y-axis is π/6 cubic units."
