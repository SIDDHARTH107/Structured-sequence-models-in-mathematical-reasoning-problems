    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n4x - 5y = 3\n\nMatrix A is the matrix of coefficients:\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nMatrix X is the column matrix of variables:\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nMatrix B is the column matrix of constants:\n\nB = | 7 |\n    | 3 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)). To do this, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nadj(A) is the adjugate of A, which is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors:\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -3 |\n         | -4  2 |\n\nNow, multiply adj(A) by (1/det(A)):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                   | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/22  3/22 |\n         | 4/22 -2/22 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution matrix X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/22  3/22 | * | 7 |\n    |  4/22 -2/22 |   | 3 |\n\nX = | (5/22)*7 + (3/22)*3 |\n    | (4/22)*7 + (-2/22)*3 |\n\nX = | 35/22 + 9/22 |\n    | 28/22 - 6/22 |\n\nX = | 44/22 |\n    | 22/22 |\n\nX = | 2 |\n    | 1 |\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2 and y = 1."
