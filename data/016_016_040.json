    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve or the flowsnake, is a space-filling curve with a fractal dimension that can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFractal Dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces in each iteration, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Gosper curve, N = 7 (each iteration consists of 7 smaller copies of the previous curve), and S = 3 (each side of the curve is scaled down by a factor of 3).\n\nSo, the fractal dimension of the Gosper curve is:\n\nD = log(7) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.77124\n\nThis fractal dimension remains the same regardless of the number of iterations since it is a property of the curve itself. Therefore, the fractal dimension of the Gosper curve after four iterations is still approximately 1.77124."
