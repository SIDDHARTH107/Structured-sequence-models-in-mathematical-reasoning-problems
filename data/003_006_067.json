    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side of the triangle. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite the side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 5 meters, b = 7 meters, and angle C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nC = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 25 + 49 - 70 * (1/2)\nc² = 74 - 35\nc² = 39\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\n\nc = √39 ≈ 6.24 meters\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the triangle is approximately 6.24 meters."
