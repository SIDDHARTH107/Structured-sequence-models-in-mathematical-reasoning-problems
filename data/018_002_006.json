    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of both sets, we need to show that every element in the intersection of A and B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nLet's first find the intersection of set A and set B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x from the intersection A ∩ B. We need to show that x is an element of both A and B.\n\nSince x is an element of A ∩ B, it must be an element that is common to both A and B. Therefore, x must be an element of A and x must be an element of B.\n\nFor example, let's take the element 3 from A ∩ B. We can see that 3 is an element of A and 3 is also an element of B. Similarly, for the other elements in A ∩ B, they are also elements of A and B.\n\nThus, we can conclude that every element in the intersection of set A and set B is an element of both set A and set B. Therefore, the intersection of set A and set B (A ∩ B) is a subset of both sets A and B."
