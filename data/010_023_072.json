    "message_1": "Consider the trefoil knot, a knot in 3-dimensional space that looks like a simple overhand knot but with two additional loops. What is the minimum number of times the knot must be twisted in order for the two extra loops to be removed and the knot to become the unknot?",
    "message_2": "The trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, and it cannot be untangled into the unknot without cutting and rejoining the rope. This is because the trefoil knot has a knot invariant known as the Jones polynomial, which is different from that of the unknot. Since the Jones polynomial is unchanged under any continuous deformation of the knot, it is impossible to untwist the trefoil knot into the unknot without cutting the rope."
