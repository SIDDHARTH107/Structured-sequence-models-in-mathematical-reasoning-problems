    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we will first eliminate one variable from two of the equations, and then eliminate the same variable from the other two equations. Finally, we will solve the resulting system of two equations with two variables.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from equations (2) and (3).\n\nTo do this, we will multiply equation (2) by 3 and equation (3) by -1, and then add the two equations.\n\n(3)(x - 2y + z) = (3)(6 + 7i)\n(-1)(3x + 5y - 2z) = (-1)(-8 - 3i)\n\n3x - 6y + 3z = 18 + 21i\n-3x - 5y + 2z = 8 + 3i\n--------------------------\n-11y + 5z = 26 + 24i\n\nNow we have a new equation:\n\nEquation (4): -11y + 5z = 26 + 24i\n\nStep 2: Eliminate x from equations (1) and (3).\n\nTo do this, we will multiply equation (1) by -3/2 and equation (3) by 1, and then add the two equations.\n\n(-3/2)(2x + 3y + 4z) = (-3/2)(5i)\n(3x + 5y - 2z) = -8 - 3i\n\n-3x - 9/2y - 6z = -15/2i\n3x + 5y - 2z = -8 - 3i\n--------------------------\n(-1/2)y - 8z = -8 - 3i - 15/2i\n\nNow we have a new equation:\n\nEquation (5): (-1/2)y - 8z = -8 - 19/2i\n\nStep 3: Solve the system of equations (4) and (5) for y and z.\n\nTo eliminate y, we will multiply equation (4) by 1/2 and equation (5) by 11, and then add the two equations.\n\n(1/2)(-11y + 5z) = (1/2)(26 + 24i)\n(11)(-1/2y - 8z) = (11)(-8 - 19/2i)\n\n-5.5y + 2.5z = 13 + 12i\n-5.5y - 88z = -88 - 209/2i\n--------------------------\n90.5z = -75 - 197/2i\n\nNow, divide by 90.5:\n\nz = (-75 - 197/2i) / 90.5\nz = (-75/90.5) - (197/2*90.5)i\nz = -5/6 - (197/181)i\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into equation (4) or (5) to find y. We'll use equation (4):\n\n-11y + 5z = 26 + 24i\n-11y + 5(-5/6 - 197/181i) = 26 + 24i\n\nNow, distribute the 5:\n\n-11y - 25/6 - 985/181i = 26 + 24i\n\nAdd 25/6 to both sides:\n\n-11y = 131/6 + 1009/181i\n\nNow, divide by -11:\n\ny = (-131/66) - (1009/1991)i\n\nNow that we have y and z, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find x. We'll use equation (1):\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 5i\n2x + 3((-131/66) - (1009/1991)i) + 4(-5/6 - 197/181i) = 5i\n\nNow, distribute the 3 and 4:\n\n2x - 131/22 - 3027/1991i - 20/6 - 788/181i = 5i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x = 151/22 + 4815/1991i\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\nx = 151/44 + 4815/3982i\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 151/44 + 4815/3982i\ny = -131/66 - 1009/1991i\nz = -5/6 - 197/181i"
