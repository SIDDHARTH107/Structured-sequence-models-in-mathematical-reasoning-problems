    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartan connection of M at the point (1, 1), we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols, which are given by the following formula:\n\n$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} + \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l})$\n\nHere, $g^{kl}$ is the inverse of the metric tensor g. Let's first compute the inverse of g:\n\n$g^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(1)(5) - (2)(2)} \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & -2 \\\\ -2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.25 & -0.5 \\\\ -0.5 & 0.25 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the metric tensor components with respect to the coordinates $x^i$ and $x^j$. Since the metric tensor g is constant, all of its partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} = \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} = 0$\n\nThus, the Christoffel symbols are also zero:\n\n$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0$\n\nThe Cartan connection is given by the Christoffel symbols, so the Cartan connection of M at the point (1, 1) is also zero."
