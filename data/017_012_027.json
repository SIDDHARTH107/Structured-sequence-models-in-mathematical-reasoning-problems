    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, we can analyze the properties of these groups and compare them to G.\n\n1. Cyclic group C16: A group of order 16 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 16. If G has an element of order 16, then G is isomorphic to C16.\n\n2. Dihedral group D8: The dihedral group D8 has order 16 and is non-abelian. It is the group of symmetries of a regular octagon, including rotations and reflections. If G is non-abelian and has the same structure as the symmetries of a regular octagon, then G is isomorphic to D8.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 16: If G is not cyclic and does not have the structure of the dihedral group D8, then it must be a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nTo determine which of these possibilities applies to G, we would need more information about the structure and properties of G. Without further information, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16."
