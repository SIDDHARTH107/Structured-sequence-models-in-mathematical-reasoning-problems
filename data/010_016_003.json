    "message_2": "Let's compute the self-intersection of the fundamental class [X] under the Poincaré duality isomorphism.\n\nSince X is a compact connected orientable 2-dimensional manifold with boundary, we know that its Euler characteristic χ(X) can be computed using the formula:\n\nχ(X) = χ(∂X) - χ(X - ∂X),\n\nwhere ∂X denotes the boundary of X, and X - ∂X denotes the manifold X with its boundary removed.\n\nNow, let's consider the homology groups of X. We are given that H_1(X) is isomorphic to ℤ/2ℤ. Since X is a 2-dimensional manifold, we know that H_2(X) is generated by the fundamental class [X]. Moreover, since X is orientable, we have that H_2(X) is isomorphic to ℤ.\n\nNow, let's compute the self-intersection of [X] under the Poincaré duality isomorphism. This is given by the intersection product:\n\n[X] · [X] = ⟨[X] ∪ [X], [X]⟩,\n\nwhere ⟨ , ⟩ denotes the Kronecker pairing, and ∪ denotes the cup product.\n\nSince H_1(X) is isomorphic to ℤ/2ℤ, we know that the cup product on H^1(X) is trivial. Therefore, we have:\n\n[X] ∪ [X] = 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the self-intersection:\n\n[X] · [X] = ⟨0, [X]⟩ = 0.\n\nSo, the self-intersection of the fundamental class [X] under the Poincaré duality isomorphism is 0."
