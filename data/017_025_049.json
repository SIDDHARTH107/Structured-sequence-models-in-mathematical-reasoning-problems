    "message_1": "What is the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, and which of the 3 categories (cyclic group C120, alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or non-abelian group) does each belong to?",
    "message_2": "There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120. They can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group C120: This group is abelian and consists of a single element of order 120. It is generated by a single element, and all its elements are powers of the generator.\n\n2. Alternating group A5 × C2 × C2: This group is non-abelian and is a direct product of the alternating group A5 (which has order 60) and two cyclic groups of order 2. The group A5 is the group of even permutations of 5 elements, and it is non-abelian.\n\n3. Dihedral group D60: This group is non-abelian and has order 120. It is the group of symmetries of a regular 60-gon, including rotations and reflections. It can be thought of as a semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 60 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\n4. S3 × D20: This group is non-abelian and is a direct product of the symmetric group S3 (which has order 6) and the dihedral group D20 (which has order 20). The symmetric group S3 is the group of all permutations of 3 elements, and it is non-abelian.\n\n5. SL(2,5): This group is non-abelian and has order 120. It is the special linear group of 2x2 matrices with determinant 1 over the finite field with 5 elements. This group is a subgroup of the general linear group GL(2,5), which has order 600.\n\nIn summary, there is 1 cyclic group, 1 alternating group, and 3 non-abelian groups of order 120."
