    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we need to find the angle opposite the longest side, which is 10 meters. We will use the Law of Cosines to find this angle. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c. In this case, a = 7 meters, b = 9 meters, and c = 10 meters. We want to find angle C.\n\n10² = 7² + 9² - 2 * 7 * 9 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 49 + 81 - 126 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 130 - 126 * cos(C)\n\nSubtract 130 from both sides:\n\n-30 = -126 * cos(C)\n\nDivide both sides by -126:\n\ncos(C) = 30/126\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(30/126)\n\nC ≈ 106.26°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 106.26°."
