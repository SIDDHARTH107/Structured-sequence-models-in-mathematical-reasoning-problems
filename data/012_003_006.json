    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices is a set of vertices in which no two vertices are adjacent. To find the maximum number of independent vertices that can be chosen from this graph, we need to select the vertices in such a way that no two of them are connected by an edge.\n\nOne possible maximum independent set of vertices is {1, 6, 7, 8}. There are 4 vertices in this set, and none of them are connected by an edge. There is no way to add more vertices to this set without violating the independence condition.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of independent vertices that can be chosen from this graph is 4."
