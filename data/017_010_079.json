    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10, we will first analyze the Sylow theorems and then consider the possible structures of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide the order of G, which is 10, and n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 5. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide the order of G, and n_5 must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possible value for n_5 is 1.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be of order 2. Let P_2 be this Sylow 2-subgroup. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be of order 5. Let P_5 be this Sylow 5-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G. Since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_2 ∩ P_5 = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the product of P_2 and P_5. Since the intersection is trivial, the product of their orders is equal to the order of G, i.e., |P_2||P_5| = |G|. Thus, |G| = 2 * 5 = 10. Since P_2 and P_5 are both normal in G, their product, P_2P_5, is a subgroup of G. Since the order of P_2P_5 is equal to the order of G, we have that P_2P_5 = G.\n\nNow, let a be an element of order 2 in P_2 and b be an element of order 5 in P_5. Since P_2 and P_5 are normal in G, we have that ab = ba. Thus, G is generated by a and b, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is isomorphic to C2 × C5 ≅ C10.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5\nIf there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, each must be of order 2. Let P_2 be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups, and let a be an element of order 2 in P_2. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be of order 5 and normal in G. Let P_5 be this Sylow 5-subgroup, and let b be an element of order 5 in P_5.\n\nNow, consider the semidirect product of P_2 and P_5. Since the intersection of P_2 and P_5 is trivial, we have that G is generated by a and b. The group operation can be described as follows: a^2 = e, b^5 = e, and bab^(-1) = a^(-1). This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10. Since we have shown that G satisfies the necessary conditions for each of these groups, the proof is complete."
