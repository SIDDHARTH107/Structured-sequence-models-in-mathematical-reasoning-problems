    "message_2": "There are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. These groups can be classified into the following structures:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_32\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_2 × C_16, C_4 × C_8, and C_2 × C_2 × C_8\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_4 and C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n4. Semidirect product of two cyclic groups: There are 7 distinct semidirect products of C_2 and C_16, and 7 distinct semidirect products of C_4 and C_8.\n5. Semidirect product of three cyclic groups: There are 14 distinct semidirect products of C_2 × C_2 and C_8, and 6 distinct semidirect products of C_2 × C_4 and C_4.\n6. Semidirect product of four cyclic groups: There are 3 distinct semidirect products of C_2 × C_2 × C_2 and C_4.\n7. Quaternion group: Q_32\n8. Dihedral group: D_32\n\nThese structures account for all 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
