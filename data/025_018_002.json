    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line at the point (3,0), we first need to find the slope of the tangent line. To do this, we can differentiate the equation of the ellipse implicitly with respect to x.\n\nGiven equation of ellipse: x²/9 + y²/4 = 1\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n(d/dx)(x²/9) + (d/dx)(y²/4) = (d/dx)(1)\n\n(2x/9) + (2y/4)(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the slope of the tangent line (dy/dx) at the point (3,0):\n\n(2(3)/9) + (2(0)/4)(dy/dx) = 0\n\n(2/3) + 0 = dy/dx\n\ndy/dx = -2/3\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere m is the slope, and (x1, y1) is the point (3,0):\n\ny - 0 = (-2/3)(x - 3)\n\ny = (-2/3)(x - 3)\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent line at the point (3,0) on the ellipse."
