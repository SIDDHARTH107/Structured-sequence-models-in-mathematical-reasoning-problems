    "message_1": "A game involves rolling a fair six-sided die. If you roll an even number (2, 4 or 6), you win $10. If you roll an odd number (1, 3 or 5), you lose $5. What is the probability of winning money if you play this game once?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning money, we need to determine the probability of rolling an even number. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) and 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die.\n\nThe probability of winning money is the number of successful outcomes (rolling an even number) divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nProbability of winning money = (Number of even numbers) / (Total number of outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of winning money if you play this game once is 1/2 or 50%."
