    "message_1": "A school wants to organize a field trip for 30 students. The school has 4 buses with a capacity of 15, 16, 18, and 19 seats respectively. Assuming that all students are equally likely to go on any bus, how many ways can the school assign the students to the buses if at least 1 student must go on each bus? Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's use the inclusion-exclusion principle to solve this problem. Let A_i be the set of arrangements where the i-th bus is empty. We want to find the size of the complement of the union of these sets, which is given by:\n\n|A_1^c ∩ A_2^c ∩ A_3^c ∩ A_4^c| = |U| - |A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ A_3 ∪ A_4|\n\nwhere U is the set of all possible arrangements without any restrictions.\n\nFirst, let's find |U|. We can think of this as distributing 30 students into 4 buses, which can be done in C(30+4-1, 4-1) ways, using the stars and bars method. So, |U| = C(33, 3) = 5456.\n\nNow, let's find the size of the union of the A_i sets:\n\n|A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ A_3 ∪ A_4| = Σ|A_i| - Σ|A_i ∩ A_j| + Σ|A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| - |A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4|\n\n1. Calculate Σ|A_i|:\n\n|A_1| = C(30+3-1, 3-1) = C(32, 2) = 496 (since we're distributing 30 students into 3 buses)\nSimilarly, |A_2| = 465, |A_3| = 435, and |A_4| = 406.\n\nΣ|A_i| = 496 + 465 + 435 + 406 = 1802\n\n2. Calculate Σ|A_i ∩ A_j|:\n\nThere are 6 possible intersections (A_1 ∩ A_2, A_1 ∩ A_3, A_1 ∩ A_4, A_2 ∩ A_3, A_2 ∩ A_4, A_3 ∩ A_4). In each case, we're distributing 30 students into 2 buses.\n\n|A_1 ∩ A_2| = C(30+2-1, 2-1) = C(31, 1) = 31\nAll other intersections are symmetric, so Σ|A_i ∩ A_j| = 6 * 31 = 186\n\n3. Calculate Σ|A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k|:\n\nThere are 4 possible intersections (A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3, A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_4, A_1 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4, A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4). In each case, we're distributing 30 students into 1 bus, which can only be done in 1 way (all students in the remaining bus).\n\nΣ|A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| = 4 * 1 = 4\n\n4. Calculate |A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4|:\n\nThis is an impossible situation, as it would mean all buses are empty. So, |A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4| = 0\n\nNow, we can calculate |A_1^c ∩ A_2^c ∩ A_3^c ∩ A_4^c|:\n\n|A_1^c ∩ A_2^c ∩ A_3^c ∩ A_4^c| = |U| - |A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ A_3 ∪ A_4|\n= 5456 - (1802 - 186 + 4)\n= 5456 - 1616\n= 3840\n\nSo, there are 3840 ways to assign the students to the buses with at least 1 student on each bus."
