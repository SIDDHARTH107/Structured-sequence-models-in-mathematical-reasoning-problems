    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure, specifically its maximum degree (the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex).\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, you have a complete graph with 7 vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, you would need 7 colors to ensure that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not complete and has a lower maximum degree, you may need fewer colors. For example, if the maximum degree is 3 (each vertex is connected to at most 3 other vertices), you would need at most 4 colors, according to the Four Color Theorem.\n\nSo, the minimum number of colors needed can range from 4 to 7, depending on the graph's structure and maximum degree."
