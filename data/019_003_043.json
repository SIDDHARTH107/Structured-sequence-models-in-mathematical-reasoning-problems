    "message_1": "Here's an example question based on modal logic:\n\nConsider a modal language with only two possible atomic propositions, p and q. Let K be a knowledge operator, so that Kp denotes \"it is known that p.\" Write down a formula to express the following sentence: \n\n\"It is not the case that p is known and q is not known.\"\n\nSolution: \n\n¬(Kp ∧ ¬Kq)",
    "message_2": "You have correctly written the formula to express the given sentence in modal logic. The formula ¬(Kp ∧ ¬Kq) represents \"It is not the case that p is known and q is not known.\""
