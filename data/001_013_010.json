    "message_2": "To solve the equation sqrt(3x + 7) = 5, follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n(sqrt(3x + 7))^2 = 5^2\n\n2. Simplify:\n3x + 7 = 25\n\n3. Subtract 7 from both sides:\n3x = 18\n\n4. Divide by 3:\nx = 6\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = 6."
