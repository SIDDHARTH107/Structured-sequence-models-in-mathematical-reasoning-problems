    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 96 and their isomorphism types, we first need to find the prime factorization of 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is based on the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. For 96, we have the partitions:\n\n5 = 5\n  = 4 + 1\n  = 3 + 2\n  = 3 + 1 + 1\n  = 2 + 2 + 1\n  = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n  = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n1 = 1\n\nUsing these partitions, we can find the number of abelian groups of order 96:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 96: Z_96\n2. Z_2 x Z_48\n3. Z_3 x Z_32\n4. Z_3 x Z_2 x Z_16\n5. Z_3 x Z_2 x Z_8 x Z_4\n6. Z_3 x Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2\n7. Z_3 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n\nThere are 7 abelian groups of order 96. Now, we need to find the total number of groups of order 96. According to the formula, there are 15 groups of order 96. Therefore, there are 15 - 7 = 8 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nThe isomorphism types of these 8 non-abelian groups are:\n\n1. (Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_24\n2. (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_12\n3. (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_6\n4. (Z_2 x Z_4) ⋊ Z_12\n5. (Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_6\n6. (Z_2 x Z_8) ⋊ Z_3\n7. (Z_4 x Z_4) ⋊ Z_3\n8. (Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_3\n\nThese are the 8 non-abelian groups of order 96 and their isomorphism types."
