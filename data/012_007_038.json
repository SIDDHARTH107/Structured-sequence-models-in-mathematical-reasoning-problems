    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will start by initializing the flow in each edge to 0 and iteratively find augmenting paths to increase the flow.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from A to D. One possible path is A -> B -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is min(5, 2, 3) = 2. We update the flow along this path by adding the minimum capacity to the current flow.\n\n   Updated capacities:\n   AB: 5 - 2 = 3\n   AD: 3\n   AC: 2 - 2 = 0\n   BC: 2 - 2 = 0\n   BD: 1\n   CD: 3 - 2 = 1\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path from A to D. One possible path is A -> B -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is min(3, 1) = 1. We update the flow along this path by adding the minimum capacity to the current flow.\n\n   Updated capacities:\n   AB: 3 - 1 = 2\n   AD: 3\n   AC: 0\n   BC: 0\n   BD: 1 - 1 = 0\n   CD: 1\n\n3. We try to find another augmenting path from A to D. However, there are no more paths available, as the path A -> B -> C -> D is blocked by the edge BC with 0 capacity, and the path A -> B -> D is blocked by the edge BD with 0 capacity.\n\nSince there are no more augmenting paths, we have found the maximum flow from node A to node D. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows along the paths we found:\n\nMaximum flow = 2 (from the first path) + 1 (from the second path) = 3."
