    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization method inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this case, we will use it to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x + 2 in the range [-1, 5]. Here's a simplified version of the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the Harmony Memory (HM) with random solutions (x values) within the given range.\n2. Improvise a new harmony (solution) based on the HM.\n3. Evaluate the new harmony (calculate f(x) for the new solution).\n4. If the new harmony is better than the worst harmony in the HM, replace the worst harmony with the new one.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n6. Select the best harmony (solution) from the HM as the final solution.\n\nLet's apply the HS algorithm with a simplified example:\n\n1. Initialize HM with 5 random solutions: [-0.5, 1, 3, 4.5, 2.5]\n2. Improvise a new harmony, e.g., x_new = 2.8\n3. Evaluate f(x_new) = 3(2.8)^3 - 5(2.8)^2 + 7(2.8) + 2 = 30.656\n4. Compare f(x_new) with the worst harmony in HM (e.g., f(4.5) = 103.875). Since f(x_new) is better, replace the worst harmony with the new one: [-0.5, 1, 3, 2.8, 2.5]\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n6. Select the best harmony from the HM (e.g., f(-0.5) = -0.875).\n\nIn this simplified example, the minimum value of the function f(x) in the range [-1, 5] is approximately -0.875, which occurs at x = -0.5. Note that the actual minimum value may be different, as the HS algorithm is a heuristic method and may not always find the global optimum. To improve the accuracy of the solution, you can increase the size of the HM, the number of iterations, or fine-tune the algorithm's parameters."
