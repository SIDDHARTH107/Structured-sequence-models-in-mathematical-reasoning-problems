    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a math student to solve in the Network optimization subtopic:\n\nA manufacturing company has a network of five factories (A, B, C, D, E) that produce a total of 900 units of a product daily. The product is then distributed to three warehouses (X, Y, Z) through a network of transportation routes. The maximum daily transportation capacity of each route is given in the table below. The company wants to determine the optimal transportation plan to minimize the total transportation cost, given that the cost per unit transported on each route is also given in the table below.\n\nTransportation Route  | Maximum Daily Capacity (units) | Cost per unit transported ($)\n------------- | ------------- | -------------\nA → X | 200 | 4\nA → Y | 300 | 3\nB → X | 150 | 6\nB → Y | 150 | 4\nB → Z | 100 | 5\nC → X | 200 | 2\nC → Z | 150 | 4\nD → Y | 200 | 7\nE → Z | 200 | 6\n\nWhat is the optimal transportation plan to minimize the total transportation cost? How much will this plan cost the company?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the transportation algorithm. First, let's define the decision variables:\n\nx1 = units transported from A to X\nx2 = units transported from A to Y\nx3 = units transported from B to X\nx4 = units transported from B to Y\nx5 = units transported from B to Z\nx6 = units transported from C to X\nx7 = units transported from C to Z\nx8 = units transported from D to Y\nx9 = units transported from E to Z\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the total transportation cost:\n\nCost = 4x1 + 3x2 + 6x3 + 4x4 + 5x5 + 2x6 + 4x7 + 7x8 + 6x9\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Supply constraints (factories' production):\nx1 + x2 = 300 (Factory A)\nx3 + x4 + x5 = 300 (Factory B)\nx6 + x7 = 200 (Factory C)\nx8 = 100 (Factory D)\nx9 = 100 (Factory E)\n\n2. Demand constraints (warehouses' capacity):\nx1 + x3 + x6 = 400 (Warehouse X)\nx2 + x4 + x8 = 300 (Warehouse Y)\nx5 + x7 + x9 = 200 (Warehouse Z)\n\n3. Maximum daily capacity constraints:\n0 ≤ x1 ≤ 200\n0 ≤ x2 ≤ 300\n0 ≤ x3 ≤ 150\n0 ≤ x4 ≤ 150\n0 ≤ x5 ≤ 100\n0 ≤ x6 ≤ 200\n0 ≤ x7 ≤ 150\n0 ≤ x8 ≤ 200\n0 ≤ x9 ≤ 200\n\nSolving this linear programming problem, we get the optimal transportation plan:\n\nx1 = 200\nx2 = 100\nx3 = 0\nx4 = 150\nx5 = 100\nx6 = 200\nx7 = 0\nx8 = 100\nx9 = 100\n\nThe optimal transportation plan is:\nA → X: 200 units\nA → Y: 100 units\nB → Y: 150 units\nB → Z: 100 units\nC → X: 200 units\nD → Y: 100 units\nE → Z: 100 units\n\nThe total cost of this plan is:\n\nCost = 4(200) + 3(100) + 6(0) + 4(150) + 5(100) + 2(200) + 4(0) + 7(100) + 6(100) = 800 + 300 + 0 + 600 + 500 + 400 + 0 + 700 + 600 = 3900\n\nThe optimal transportation plan will cost the company $3,900."
