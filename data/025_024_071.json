    "message_2": "In a projective plane, any two distinct points determine a unique line. Since we have 5 points, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 points from these 5 points. This can be done using combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 points from 5 points is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!)\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!)\n\nC(5, 2) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(5, 2) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)\n\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 lines passing through exactly two points of a given set of five points in the projective plane ùîΩ¬≤."
