    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has to produce an item in batches of 10,000 units. The cost per batch is $3000. The selling price per unit is $5. The production cost per unit decreases by 1% for every 2 degrees Celsius decrease in temperature during production. The company wants to determine the optimal production temperature that will maximize their profit. Use simulated annealing method with an initial temperature of 200°C and a cooling rate of 0.01. What is the optimal production temperature for maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we need to define the objective function, the initial solution, and the cooling schedule.\n\nObjective function: Profit = (Selling price per unit - Production cost per unit) * Number of units - Fixed cost per batch\n\nInitial solution: Initial production temperature = 200°C\n\nCooling schedule: Cooling rate = 0.01\n\nNow, we will perform the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Set the initial temperature T = 200°C.\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution by decreasing the temperature by a small random value.\n3. Calculate the profit for the current solution and the neighboring solution.\n4. If the neighboring solution has a higher profit, accept it as the new current solution.\n5. If the neighboring solution has a lower profit, accept it with a probability of exp((neighboring_profit - current_profit) / T).\n6. Decrease the temperature by the cooling rate: T = T * (1 - cooling_rate).\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the temperature is close to zero or the profit has converged.\n\nAfter performing the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain the optimal production temperature that maximizes the profit. Note that the actual optimal temperature may vary depending on the random nature of the simulated annealing algorithm. To obtain a more accurate result, you can run the algorithm multiple times and take the average of the optimal temperatures obtained."
