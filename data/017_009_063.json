    "message_2": "We are given that G is a group of order 9, and there are two possible isomorphic groups: C9 (the cyclic group of order 9) and G. We need to show that G has at least one non-commutative element.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that G is a commutative group. This means that for all elements a, b in G, we have ab = ba. If G is commutative, then it must be isomorphic to C9, as C9 is the only commutative group of order 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the group G. Since the order of G is 9, by Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element g in G such that the order of g is 3 (since 3 is a prime divisor of 9). Let H be the subgroup of G generated by g, i.e., H = {e, g, g^2}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nSince G is commutative, for any element h in H and any element x in G, we have hx = xh. This implies that H is a normal subgroup of G. Now, let's consider the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 9/3 = 3, which is a prime number.\n\nBy the fact that a group of prime order is cyclic, G/H must be a cyclic group. Let's denote the generator of G/H as gH, where g is an element of G. Then, G/H = {H, gH, (g^2)H}.\n\nNow, let's consider the element g^3 in G. Since G is isomorphic to C9, g^3 must be a non-identity element of G. However, we have (g^3)H = (gH)^3 = H, which implies that g^3 is in H. But this contradicts the fact that G is isomorphic to C9, as g^3 should not be in H.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that G is commutative must be false. Hence, G has at least one non-commutative element."
