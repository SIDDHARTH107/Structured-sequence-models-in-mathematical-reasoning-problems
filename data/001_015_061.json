    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a form that allows us to isolate x. Since 81 is a power of 3 (3^4 = 81), we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n3^(x+2) = 3^4\n\nNow, we can use the property of equality of exponential functions, which states that if a^x = a^y, then x = y. In this case, we have:\n\nx + 2 = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 4 - 2\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution for x is 2."
