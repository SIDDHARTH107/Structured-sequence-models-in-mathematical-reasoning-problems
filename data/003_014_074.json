    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4), we can analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function, which is:\n\nf(x) = A * sin(B * (x - C))\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our given function, f(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4), we can identify the following:\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the coefficient of the sine function, which is 3 in this case. The amplitude represents the maximum value of the function, so the function oscillates between -3 and 3.\n\nPeriod: The period is determined by the coefficient of x inside the sine function, which is 2 in this case. The period of a sine function is 2π divided by the coefficient of x, so the period of this function is 2π / 2 = π. This means that the function completes one full cycle over an interval of length π.\n\nPhase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value that is added or subtracted inside the sine function. In this case, it is π/4. To find the actual phase shift, we need to divide this value by the coefficient of x (which is 2) and then change the sign. So, the phase shift is (-π/4) / 2 = -π/8. This means that the function is shifted to the right by π/8 units.\n\nNow, let's graph one complete cycle of the function:\n\n1. Start by drawing the x-axis and y-axis.\n2. Mark the amplitude on the y-axis (3 and -3).\n3. Mark the period on the x-axis (π).\n4. Mark the phase shift on the x-axis (-π/8).\n5. Draw the sine curve starting from the phase shift, reaching the maximum amplitude at π/4 - π/8 (which is π/8), reaching the minimum amplitude at 3π/4 - π/8 (which is 5π/8), and completing one cycle at π.\n\nThe graph of one complete cycle of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4) will show a sine curve with an amplitude of 3, a period of π, and a phase shift of -π/8."
