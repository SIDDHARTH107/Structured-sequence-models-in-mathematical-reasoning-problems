    "message_1": "In a small town, there are 20 farmers who share a common grazing land. Each farmer has a herd of 8 cows. The maximum number of cows that the land can sustain is 100, but if more than 100 cows graze, the land will become overgrazed and the pasture will be ruined. Each farmer can choose how many cows to graze on the land. If a farmer does not graze any cows on the land, he will not receive any profit. If a farmer grazes cows on the land, he will receive a profit of $400 per cow at the end of the year. However, if the farmers collectively graze more than 100 cows, the overgrazing will cause the land to be ruined, and each farmer will lose $1000 per cow.\n\nIf each farmer chooses the number of cows to graze independently and plans to maximize his own profit, how many cows will graze on the land in total and what will be the total profit of all farmers at the end of the year?",
    "message_2": "Each farmer will try to maximize their profit by grazing as many cows as possible without causing overgrazing. Since there are 20 farmers and the land can sustain 100 cows, each farmer can graze 100/20 = 5 cows without causing overgrazing.\n\nIf each farmer grazes 5 cows, there will be a total of 20 * 5 = 100 cows grazing on the land. This is the maximum number of cows the land can sustain without being ruined.\n\nThe total profit for each farmer will be 5 cows * $400 per cow = $2000. Since there are 20 farmers, the total profit for all farmers at the end of the year will be 20 * $2000 = $40,000."
