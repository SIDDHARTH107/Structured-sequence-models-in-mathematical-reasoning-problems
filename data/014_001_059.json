    "message_2": "To find the private key d, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)), which is the value of d\n\nStep 1: Compute n = p * q\nn = 11 * 17 = 187\n\nStep 2: Compute φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nφ(n) = (11-1) * (17-1) = 10 * 16 = 160\n\nStep 3: Find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n))\nWe need to find a value for d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1\ne = 7, φ(n) = 160\n7 * d ≡ 1 (mod 160)\n\nBy trying different values or using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 23 satisfies this condition:\n(7 * 23) % 160 = 161 % 160 = 1\n\nNow that we have the private key d = 23, we can decrypt the ciphertext c = 2.\n\nDecryption formula: m = c^d % n\nm = 2^23 % 187\n\n2^23 = 8,388,608\nm = 8,388,608 % 187 = 88\n\nSo, the decrypted message (plaintext) is m = 88."
