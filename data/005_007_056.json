They collect data from 10 students and obtain the following results:\n\n- Hours of study: {4, 6, 3, 7, 5, 2, 8, 3, 9, 6}\n- Midterm exam scores: {75, 83, 65, 88, 79, 60, 91, 70, 93, 81}\n\nUsing correlation analysis, what is the correlation coefficient between the number of hours students spend studying and their midterm exam scores? Round your result to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient, we will use the Pearson correlation formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / sqrt[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of both sets of data:\n\nx̄ = (4 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 9 + 6) / 10 = 53 / 10 = 5.3\nȳ = (75 + 83 + 65 + 88 + 79 + 60 + 91 + 70 + 93 + 81) / 10 = 785 / 10 = 78.5\n\nNext, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator: Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)]\nDenominator: sqrt[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nNumerator:\n(4-5.3)(75-78.5) + (6-5.3)(83-78.5) + (3-5.3)(65-78.5) + (7-5.3)(88-78.5) + (5-5.3)(79-78.5) + (2-5.3)(60-78.5) + (8-5.3)(91-78.5) + (3-5.3)(70-78.5) + (9-5.3)(93-78.5) + (6-5.3)(81-78.5) = -4.5 + 12.6 - 7.8 + 29.4 + 1.4 - 13.65 + 22.05 - 4.5 + 40.95 + 7.35 = 83.4\n\nDenominator:\nsqrt[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²] = sqrt[(4-5.3)² + (6-5.3)² + (3-5.3)² + (7-5.3)² + (5-5.3)² + (2-5.3)² + (8-5.3)² + (3-5.3)² + (9-5.3)² + (6-5.3)²] * sqrt[(75-78.5)² + (83-78.5)² + (65-78.5)² + (88-78.5)² + (79-78.5)² + (60-78.5)² + (91-78.5)² + (70-78.5)² + (93-78.5)² + (81-78.5)²] = sqrt[1.69 + 0.49 + 5.29 + 2.89 + 0.09 + 10.89 + 7.29 + 6.25 + 13.69 + 0.49] * sqrt[12.25 + 20.25 + 182.25 + 90.25 + 0.25 + 342.25 + 156.25 + 72.25 + 210.25 + 6.25] = sqrt[48.97] * sqrt[1092.5] = 6.9991 * 33.04542\n\nNow, we can find the correlation coefficient:\n\nr = 83.4 / (6.9991 * 33.04542) = 83.4 / 231.227 = 0.3607\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the correlation coefficient is 0.36."
