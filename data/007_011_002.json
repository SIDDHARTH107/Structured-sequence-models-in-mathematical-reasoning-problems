We are looking for the smallest positive integer that is a quadratic residue modulo 3 and 5, but not modulo 7.\n\nFirst, let's find the quadratic residues modulo 3, 5, and 7.\n\nModulo 3:\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 3)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2² ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nQuadratic residues modulo 3 are {0, 1}.\n\nModulo 5:\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n3² ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n4² ≡ 1 (mod 5)\nQuadratic residues modulo 5 are {0, 1, 4}.\n\nModulo 7:\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3² ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n4² ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n5² ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n6² ≡ 1 (mod 7)\nQuadratic residues modulo 7 are {0, 1, 2, 4}.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer that is a quadratic residue modulo 3 and 5, but not modulo 7. From the sets above, we can see that the number 4 is a quadratic residue modulo 3 and 5, but not modulo 7.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that is a quadratic residue modulo both 3 and 5, but not modulo 7, is 4."
