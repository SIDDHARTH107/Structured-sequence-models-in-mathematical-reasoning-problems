    "message_2": "In a simple undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have 7 vertices and 9 edges.\n\nLet the degrees of the vertices be d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7. According to the Handshaking Lemma:\n\nd1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 2 * 9 = 18\n\nSince the graph has 9 edges, the maximum degree of a vertex is 6 (as it can be connected to all other vertices). However, we cannot determine a unique degree sequence for this graph, as there are multiple possibilities that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nFor example, the following degree sequences all satisfy the conditions:\n\n1. (3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2)\n2. (4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n3. (5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2)\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there may be other valid degree sequences as well."
