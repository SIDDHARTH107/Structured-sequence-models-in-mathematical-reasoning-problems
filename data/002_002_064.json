    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nV = (4/3)π(5 cm)³\nV = (4/3)π(125 cm³)\nV ≈ 4.19 * 125 cm³\nV ≈ 523.6 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
