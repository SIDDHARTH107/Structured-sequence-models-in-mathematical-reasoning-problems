    "message_2": "A Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern formed by recursively removing squares from an initial square. In each iteration, the square is divided into 9 smaller squares (3x3), and the central square is removed, leaving 8 smaller squares. This process is repeated for each of the remaining squares.\n\nLet's calculate the area of the remaining squares after 5 iterations:\n\nInitial square side length: 27 cm\nInitial square area: 27 * 27 = 729 cm²\n\nIn the first iteration, we remove 1/9 of the area:\nRemaining area after 1st iteration: 729 * (8/9) = 648 cm²\n\nIn the second iteration, we remove 1/9 of the area from each of the 8 smaller squares:\nRemaining area after 2nd iteration: 648 * (8/9) = 576 cm²\n\nIn the third iteration, we remove 1/9 of the area from each of the 8² = 64 smaller squares:\nRemaining area after 3rd iteration: 576 * (8/9) = 512 cm²\n\nIn the fourth iteration, we remove 1/9 of the area from each of the 8³ = 512 smaller squares:\nRemaining area after 4th iteration: 512 * (8/9) = 455.111 cm²\n\nIn the fifth iteration, we remove 1/9 of the area from each of the 8⁴ = 4096 smaller squares:\nRemaining area after 5th iteration: 455.111 * (8/9) ≈ 404.098 cm²\n\nSo, after 5 iterations, the total area of the remaining squares is approximately 404.098 cm²."
