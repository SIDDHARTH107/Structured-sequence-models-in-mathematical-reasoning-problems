    "message_1": "In a music festival, there are 20 performers scheduled to play. 5 of the performers are rock bands, 8 of the performers are solo artists, and 7 of the performers are DJs. If a randomly selected performer is chosen, what is the probability that the selected performer will be a rock band or a DJ?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a rock band or a DJ, we first need to determine the total number of favorable outcomes (rock bands and DJs) and the total number of possible outcomes (all performers).\n\nThere are 5 rock bands and 7 DJs, so there are a total of 5 + 7 = 12 favorable outcomes.\n\nThere are 20 performers in total, so there are 20 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 12/20\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n\n12 รท 4 = 3\n20 รท 4 = 5\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a rock band or a DJ is 3/5 or 0.6 (60%)."
