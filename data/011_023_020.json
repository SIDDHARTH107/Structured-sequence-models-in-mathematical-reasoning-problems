    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph with 6 vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to consider the maximum degree of the graph. The maximum degree of a graph is the highest number of edges connected to any single vertex.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In a complete graph with 6 vertices, each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices, so the maximum degree is 5.\n\nAccording to the graph coloring theorem, the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph is at most one more than the maximum degree of the graph. In this case, the maximum degree is 5, so the minimum number of colors needed is 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nHowever, we can also use the greedy coloring algorithm to check if we can color the graph with fewer colors. In a complete graph with 6 vertices, we can color the first vertex with color 1, the second vertex with color 2, the third vertex with color 3, the fourth vertex with color 4, the fifth vertex with color 5, and the sixth vertex with color 1 (since it is only adjacent to vertices 2-5). This shows that we can color the complete graph with 5 colors.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph with 6 vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 5."
