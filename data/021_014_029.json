    "message_1": "A company produces two products, Product A and Product B. The profit per unit of Product A is $4 and per unit of Product B is $6. The company has a raw material producing capacity of 80 units per day. The production time for one unit of Product A is 2 hours and for one unit of Product B is 3 hours. The production capacity of the company is 10 hours per day. Using Genetic Algorithms, determine how many units of each product should the company produce daily to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Genetic Algorithms, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the chromosome representation: A chromosome will represent a solution, containing the number of units of Product A and Product B to be produced daily. For example, a chromosome can be represented as (x, y), where x is the number of units of Product A and y is the number of units of Product B.\n\n2. Initialize the population: Generate an initial population of chromosomes (solutions) randomly, ensuring that the production time and raw material constraints are met.\n\n3. Define the fitness function: The fitness function will be the total profit, calculated as (4 * x) + (6 * y), where x and y are the number of units of Product A and Product B, respectively.\n\n4. Perform selection, crossover, and mutation: Select the fittest chromosomes (solutions) from the current population, perform crossover to generate new offspring, and apply mutation to introduce diversity.\n\n5. Evaluate the new population: Calculate the fitness of each chromosome in the new population.\n\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level.\n\nAfter running the Genetic Algorithm, we will obtain a chromosome (solution) that represents the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to be produced daily to maximize the profit, while respecting the production time and raw material constraints."
