The production of Product A requires 2 hours of labour and 3 hours of machine time, while the production of Product B requires 1.5 hours of labour and 2 hours of machine time. The company has a maximum of 25 hours of labour and 30 hours of machine time available per day. \n\nThe profit on Product A is $10 per unit and the profit on Product B is $8 per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit by determining the number of units of each product that should be produced per day. \n\nWrite a mixed-integer programming problem to determine the optimal production plan and the maximum profit that the company can earn per day.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced per day.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nMaximize P = 10x + 8y\n\nConstraints (labour and machine time):\n2x + 1.5y ≤ 25 (labour constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 30 (machine time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe mixed-integer programming problem is to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and maximize the profit P."
