    "message_2": "For a smooth projective algebraic curve X of degree 3 in the complex projective plane, the intersection cohomology groups IH^k(X) coincide with the singular cohomology groups H^k(X) since X is smooth. We can compute these groups using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the fact that X is a curve.\n\nFor k = 0, we have IH^0(X) = H^0(X) = Z, the group of integers, since X is connected.\n\nFor k = 1, we have IH^1(X) = H^1(X) = Z^2g, where g is the genus of the curve. For a curve of degree 3, the genus can be computed using the formula g = (d-1)(d-2)/2, where d is the degree. In this case, g = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 1, so IH^1(X) = Z^2.\n\nFor k = 2, we have IH^2(X) = H^2(X) = Z, since X is a curve and the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem tells us that the second cohomology group is isomorphic to the second cohomology group of the ambient projective plane, which is Z.\n\nFor k = 3, we have IH^3(X) = H^3(X) = 0, since X is a curve and its cohomology groups vanish for dimensions higher than 2.\n\nSo, the intersection cohomology groups for k = 0, 1, 2, 3 are:\n\nIH^0(X) = Z\nIH^1(X) = Z^2\nIH^2(X) = Z\nIH^3(X) = 0"
