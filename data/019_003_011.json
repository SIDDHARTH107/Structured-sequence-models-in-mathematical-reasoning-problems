    "message_1": "Sorry, I cannot generate a numerical problem for this task as Modal Logic is not about numerical problems. Modal Logic is a subfield of formal logic that studies reasoning about modalities, such as possibility and necessity. It deals with statements that are qualified by concepts like \"possibly\", \"necessarily\", \"obligatorily\", and so on. Can I assist you with anything else?",
    "message_2": "Of course! If you have any other mathematical problems or questions, feel free to ask and I'll be happy to help."
