    "message_2": "To find the sum of all positive integers that divide evenly into 28, we first need to find all the factors of 28. The factors of 28 are:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28.\n\nNow, we simply add these factors together:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28 = 56\n\nSo, the sum of all the positive integers that divide evenly into the number 28, including 1 and 28, is 56."
