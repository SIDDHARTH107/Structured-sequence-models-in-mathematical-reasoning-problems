    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 7 heads, we need to consider the probabilities of getting exactly 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X = k) = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (10 coin flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (number of heads), p is the probability of success (0.5 for heads), and q is the probability of failure (0.5 for tails).\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of getting exactly 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads:\n\nP(X = 7) = (10! / (7!(10-7)!)) * (0.5^7) * (0.5^(10-7))\nP(X = 8) = (10! / (8!(10-8)!)) * (0.5^8) * (0.5^(10-8))\nP(X = 9) = (10! / (9!(10-9)!)) * (0.5^9) * (0.5^(10-9))\nP(X = 10) = (10! / (10!(10-10)!)) * (0.5^10) * (0.5^(10-10))\n\nCalculating these probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X = 7) ≈ 0.1172\nP(X = 8) ≈ 0.0439\nP(X = 9) ≈ 0.0098\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.0010\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting at least 7 heads, we simply add these probabilities together:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\nP(X ≥ 7) ≈ 0.1172 + 0.0439 + 0.0098 + 0.0010\nP(X ≥ 7) ≈ 0.1719\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 7 heads when flipping a fair coin 10 times is approximately 0.1719 or 17.19%."
