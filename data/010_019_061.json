    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology of the level set $f^{-1}(0)$, we first need to find the critical points of the function $f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2$. To do this, we compute the derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^4 - 2x^2) = 4x^3 - 4x$.\n\nNow we set $f'(x) = 0$ to find the critical points:\n\n$4x^3 - 4x = 0 \\implies x(4x^2 - 4) = 0 \\implies x(x^2 - 1) = 0$.\n\nThis gives us three critical points: $x = -1, 0, 1$. Now we compute the second derivative of $f$ to determine the nature of these critical points:\n\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(x^4 - 2x^2) = 12x^2 - 4$.\n\nNow we evaluate $f''(x)$ at the critical points:\n\n1. $f''(-1) = 12(-1)^2 - 4 = 8 > 0$, so $x = -1$ is a local minimum.\n2. $f''(0) = 12(0)^2 - 4 = -4 < 0$, so $x = 0$ is a local maximum.\n3. $f''(1) = 12(1)^2 - 4 = 8 > 0$, so $x = 1$ is a local minimum.\n\nNow we can compute the Morse homology. The level set $f^{-1}(0)$ consists of the points where $f(x) = 0$, which are the critical points $x = -1, 0, 1$. Since $f$ is a real-valued function defined on $[-1, 1]$, the Morse homology is computed over the real line.\n\nThe Morse homology groups are generated by the critical points of the function. In this case, we have two local minima and one local maximum. The Morse homology groups are as follows:\n\n1. $H_0$: generated by the local minima $x = -1$ and $x = 1$. This group represents the connected components of the level set, and since there are two local minima, we have $H_0 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\n2. $H_1$: generated by the local maximum $x = 0$. This group represents the 1-dimensional cycles (loops) in the level set. Since there is one local maximum, we have $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3. $H_k$: for $k \\geq 2$, there are no critical points of index $k$, so the Morse homology groups are trivial: $H_k = 0$.\n\nSo the Morse homology of the level set $f^{-1}(0)$ is given by:\n\n$H_0 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$,\n$H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}$,\n$H_k = 0$ for $k \\geq 2$."
