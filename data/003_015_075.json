    "message_1": "A student is asked to determine the amplitude and period of the function f(x) = 4sin(3x). What is the amplitude and period of this function?",
    "message_2": "The function f(x) = 4sin(3x) is a sinusoidal function. The general form of a sinusoidal function is f(x) = A*sin(Bx), where A is the amplitude and B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function.\n\nIn this case, A = 4 and B = 3.\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of A, which is |4| = 4.\n\nThe period of a sinusoidal function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In this case, the period is (2π)/|3| = (2π)/3.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 4sin(3x) is 4, and the period is (2π)/3."
