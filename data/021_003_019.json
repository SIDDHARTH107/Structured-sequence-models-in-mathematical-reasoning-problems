Using Lagrange interpolation, estimate the car's speed at 5.5 seconds.\n\nTime (s) | Speed (m/s)\n--------|------------\n1 | 10\n2 | 20\n3 | 30\n4 | 40\n5 | 50\n6 | 60\n7 | 70\n8 | 80\n9 | 90\n10 | 100",
    "message_2": "To estimate the car's speed at 5.5 seconds using Lagrange interpolation, we can use the following formula:\n\nL(x) = Σ [y_i * l_i(x)]\n\nwhere L(x) is the estimated value at x, y_i are the given values, and l_i(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials defined as:\n\nl_i(x) = Π [(x - x_j) / (x_i - x_j)] for j ≠ i\n\nSince we have 10 data points, we will have 10 Lagrange basis polynomials. However, to simplify the calculation, we can choose a few neighboring points around 5.5 seconds. Let's use the data points for 4, 5, 6, and 7 seconds.\n\nx_values = [4, 5, 6, 7]\ny_values = [40, 50, 60, 70]\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lagrange basis polynomials and the estimated speed at 5.5 seconds:\n\nL(5.5) = Σ [y_i * l_i(5.5)]\n\nl_0(5.5) = [(5.5 - 5) * (5.5 - 6) * (5.5 - 7)] / [(4 - 5) * (4 - 6) * (4 - 7)] = 0.375\nl_1(5.5) = [(5.5 - 4) * (5.5 - 6) * (5.5 - 7)] / [(5 - 4) * (5 - 6) * (5 - 7)] = 1.125\nl_2(5.5) = [(5.5 - 4) * (5.5 - 5) * (5.5 - 7)] / [(6 - 4) * (6 - 5) * (6 - 7)] = 0.75\nl_3(5.5) = [(5.5 - 4) * (5.5 - 5) * (5.5 - 6)] / [(7 - 4) * (7 - 5) * (7 - 6)] = -0.25\n\nL(5.5) = 40 * 0.375 + 50 * 1.125 + 60 * 0.75 + 70 * (-0.25) = 15 + 56.25 + 45 - 17.5 = 98.75\n\nSo, the estimated speed of the car at 5.5 seconds is 98.75 m/s."
