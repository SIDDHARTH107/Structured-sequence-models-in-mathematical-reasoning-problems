    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B, each requiring different amounts of labor and material resources. The production of one unit of A requires 2 units of labor and 1 unit of material, while the production of one unit of B requires 3 units of labor and 2 units of material. The company has 200 units of labor and 100 units of material available. \n\nAssuming that the company wants to maximize its profits, and the profit of one unit of A is $10, and the profit of one unit of B is $15, what is the optimal production plan for the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We have the following constraints based on the labor and material resources:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 200 (labor constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 100 (material constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal production plan, we will solve this linear programming problem graphically by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints in terms of y:\n\ny ≤ (200 - 2x) / 3 (labor constraint)\ny ≤ (100 - x) / 2 (material constraint)\n\nNow, we'll plot the constraints and find the feasible region:\n\n1. y ≤ (200 - 2x) / 3\n2. y ≤ (100 - x) / 2\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 50), (40, 30), and (100, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 50) = 10(0) + 15(50) = $750\n3. Profit at (40, 30) = 10(40) + 15(30) = $850\n4. Profit at (100, 0) = 10(100) + 15(0) = $1000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (100, 0), with a profit of $1000. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 100 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
