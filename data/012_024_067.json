    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, we are given a graph with 9 vertices (V = 9) and 15 edges (E = 15). We can use the inequality for non-planar graphs to check if the graph is planar or not:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 9 - 6\n\n15 ≤ 27 - 6\n\n15 ≤ 21\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, we need to check if it actually is planar or not. If it is planar, then the genus is 0. If it is not planar, we need to find the smallest genus for which the graph can be embedded without crossing edges.\n\nLet's assume the graph is non-planar and try to find its genus. The inequality for a graph with genus g is:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nWe are given E = 15 and V = 9. We can plug these values into the inequality and solve for g:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 9 + 6g - 6\n\n15 ≤ 27 + 6g - 6\n\n-6 ≤ 6g\n\n1 ≤ g\n\nSince g must be an integer, the smallest possible value for g is 1. Therefore, if the graph is non-planar, its genus is at least 1.\n\nNow, we need to check if the graph is actually planar or not. If we can find a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K_3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition), then the graph is non-planar according to Kuratowski's theorem. However, without more information about the specific graph, we cannot determine if such a subgraph exists.\n\nIn conclusion, if the graph is planar, its genus is 0. If it is non-planar, its genus is at least 1. Without more information about the specific graph, we cannot determine its exact genus."
