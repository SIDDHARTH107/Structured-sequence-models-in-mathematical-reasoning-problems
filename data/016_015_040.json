    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. With each order, the curve becomes more complex, and the total length increases. For a Hilbert curve of order n, the total length can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * 4\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, we have:\n\nLength = (2^3 - 1) * 4\nLength = (8 - 1) * 4\nLength = 7 * 4\nLength = 28\n\nSo, the total length of a Hilbert curve of order 3 with each line segment being 1 unit long is 28 units."
