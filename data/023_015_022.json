    "message_1": "A cable of length 10 meters is under tension and has a mass density of 4 kg/m. Calculate the fundamental frequency of the cable assuming it is clamped at both ends and has no external force acting upon it.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental frequency of the cable, we can use the formula for the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string:\n\nf1 = (1/2L) * sqrt(T/μ)\n\nwhere f1 is the fundamental frequency, L is the length of the cable, T is the tension in the cable, and μ is the mass per unit length (mass density) of the cable.\n\nWe are given the length L = 10 meters and the mass density μ = 4 kg/m. However, we do not have the tension T in the cable. To find the tension, we can use the formula for the speed of a wave on a string:\n\nv = sqrt(T/μ)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the wave on the string. Since we do not have the speed of the wave, we cannot directly calculate the tension T. Therefore, we cannot calculate the fundamental frequency of the cable without more information."
