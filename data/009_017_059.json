Given $E_0 = 2$ V/m and $f = 60$ Hz.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field ${\\bf B}$, we can use the Maxwell's equation $\\nabla \\times {\\bf E} = -\\frac{\\partial {\\bf B}}{\\partial t}$. Since the electric field ${\\bf E}$ is given by ${\\bf E} = E_0\\cos(2 \\pi f t) {\\bf \\hat{j}}$, we can first find its time derivative:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial {\\bf E}}{\\partial t} = -2 \\pi f E_0 \\sin(2 \\pi f t) {\\bf \\hat{j}}$.\n\nNow, we can use the curl equation to find the magnetic field:\n\n$\\nabla \\times {\\bf E} = -\\frac{\\partial {\\bf B}}{\\partial t}$.\n\nSince ${\\bf E}$ only has a component in the ${\\bf \\hat{j}}$ direction, the curl of ${\\bf E}$ will only have a component in the ${\\bf \\hat{i}}$ direction:\n\n$\\nabla \\times {\\bf E} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z}\\right) {\\bf \\hat{i}} = -\\frac{\\partial {\\bf B}}{\\partial t}$.\n\nWe can now equate the components:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial t}$.\n\nSince ${\\bf E} = E_0\\cos(2 \\pi f t) {\\bf \\hat{j}}$, we have $E_y = E_0\\cos(2 \\pi f t)$ and $E_z = 0$. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n$-\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial t}$.\n\nNow, we can plug in the time derivative of ${\\bf E}$ that we found earlier:\n\n$2 \\pi f E_0 \\sin(2 \\pi f t) = \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial t}$.\n\nTo find $B_x$, we can integrate both sides with respect to time:\n\n$B_x = \\int 2 \\pi f E_0 \\sin(2 \\pi f t) dt = -\\frac{E_0}{2 \\pi f} \\cos(2 \\pi f t) + C$,\n\nwhere $C$ is the integration constant. Since the magnetic field is periodic, we can set $C = 0$. Thus, the magnetic field ${\\bf B}$ has only an ${\\bf \\hat{i}}$ component:\n\n${\\bf B} = -\\frac{E_0}{2 \\pi f} \\cos(2 \\pi f t) {\\bf \\hat{i}}$.\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of ${\\bf B}$:\n\n$|{\\bf B}| = \\left|\\frac{E_0}{2 \\pi f} \\cos(2 \\pi f t)\\right|$.\n\nGiven $E_0 = 2$ V/m and $f = 60$ Hz, we can plug in the values:\n\n$|{\\bf B}| = \\left|\\frac{2}{2 \\pi (60)} \\cos(2 \\pi (60) t)\\right| = \\frac{1}{60\\pi} \\left|\\cos(120\\pi t)\\right|$ T.\n\nThis is the magnitude of the magnetic field ${\\bf B}$ as a function of time."
