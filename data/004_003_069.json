The manufacturer can sell each unit for a price of P(x) = 20 - 0.01x dollars. Find the number of units that should be produced to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the difference between the revenue function and the cost function, which will give us the profit function. Then, we will find the critical points of the profit function and determine the number of units that should be produced to maximize profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the revenue function, R(x). Revenue is the product of the number of units produced and the price per unit:\n\nR(x) = x * P(x) = x * (20 - 0.01x)\n\nNow, let's find the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function:\n\nProfit(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (x * (20 - 0.01x)) - (5x + 5000)\n\nTo find the critical points of the profit function, we need to find its first derivative and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dx = d((x * (20 - 0.01x)) - (5x + 5000))/dx\n\nUsing the product rule and the power rule, we get:\n\nd(Profit)/dx = (20 - 0.02x) - 5\n\nNow, set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = (20 - 0.02x) - 5\n0.02x = 15\nx = 750\n\nSo, the manufacturer should produce 750 units to maximize profit."
