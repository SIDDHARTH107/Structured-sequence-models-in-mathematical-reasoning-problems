    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to add the lengths of all four sides. We are given the lengths of the base (12 cm), top edge (8 cm), and the two non-parallel sides (5 cm each).\n\nPerimeter = Base + Top edge + Non-parallel side 1 + Non-parallel side 2\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 8 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 30 cm."
