    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1m is initially at a temperature of 20°C. At time t=0, one end of the rod is suddenly introduced into a furnace that maintains the temperature at the end at 250°C, while the other end is maintained at 100°C. Use Fourier transform to determine the temperature distribution along the rod at any time t. (Assume the thermal diffusivity of the rod is 0.1 m²/s and the thermal conductivity is 50 W/mK.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, α is the thermal diffusivity, and ∂²u/∂x² is the second derivative of u with respect to x.\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = 250°C\nu(1,t) = 100°C\n\nand the initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = 20°C\n\nWe will solve this problem using the Fourier transform method. First, we will apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation with respect to x:\n\n∂U/∂t = α (-k²)U\n\nwhere U(k,t) is the Fourier transform of u(x,t) and k is the wave number. This is now an ordinary differential equation in t. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n\ndU/U = -αk² dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(U) = -αk²t + C(k)\n\nwhere C(k) is the integration constant. Taking the exponential of both sides, we obtain:\n\nU(k,t) = A(k) e^(-αk²t)\n\nwhere A(k) = e^(C(k)) is an unknown function of k.\n\nNow, we need to find A(k) by applying the inverse Fourier transform to the initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = ∫[A(k) e^(-αk²0) e^(ikx)] dk = 20\n\nThis integral equation represents the initial temperature distribution along the rod. To find A(k), we can multiply both sides by e^(-ikx) and integrate over x:\n\n∫[u(x,0) e^(-ikx)] dx = ∫[20 e^(-ikx)] dx = A(k)\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nA(k) = 20/k (e^(-ik) - 1)\n\nNow we can substitute A(k) back into the expression for U(k,t):\n\nU(k,t) = (20/k (e^(-ik) - 1)) e^(-αk²t)\n\nFinally, we apply the inverse Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution u(x,t):\n\nu(x,t) = ∫[(20/k (e^(-ik) - 1)) e^(-αk²t) e^(ikx)] dk\n\nThis integral represents the temperature distribution along the rod at any time t. In practice, you would need to evaluate this integral numerically to obtain the temperature at specific points along the rod and at specific times."
