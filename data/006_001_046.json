    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly four tails in six coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, tails) in n trials (coin flips)\n- nCk (read \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting tails) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting heads) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips), which is 6 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (tails) we want, which is 4 in this case\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 4) = (6C4) * (0.5^4) * (0.5^(6-4))\n\nFirst, let's find 6C4:\n\n6C4 = 6! / (4!(6-4)!)\n     = 6! / (4!2!)\n     = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)(2*1))\n     = (6*5) / (2*1)\n     = 15\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = 15 * (0.5^4) * (0.5^2)\n         = 15 * (0.0625) * (0.25)\n         = 15 * 0.015625\n         = 0.234375\n\nSo the probability of getting exactly four tails in six coin flips is 0.234375, or 23.44% when rounded to two decimal places."
