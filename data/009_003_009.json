The temperature at any point on the plate is given by the function u(x, y) which satisfies the following heat equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = 2(∂²u/∂x²) + 3(∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere t is time, x is the horizontal coordinate, and y is the vertical coordinate. The initial temperature of the plate is given by u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx/4)sin(πy/2).\n\nFind the temperature u(x, y, t) at the point (1, 1) on the metal plate at time t = 0.5 units.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the heat equation that satisfies the given initial condition. We can use the method of separation of variables to find the solution. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = 2X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + 3X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = 2X''(x) / X(x) + 3Y''(y) / Y(y)\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x and y only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\n\n2X''(x) / X(x) + 3Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT'(t) + λT(t) = 0\n\n2X''(x) + λX(x) = 0\n\n3Y''(y) + λY(y) = 0\n\nSolving the second and third equations, we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√(λ/2)x) + B*sin(√(λ/2)x)\n\nY(y) = C*cos(√(λ/3)y) + D*sin(√(λ/3)y)\n\nThe initial condition is u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx/4)sin(πy/2). Comparing this with the product X(x)Y(y)T(0), we can deduce that:\n\nA = 0, B = 1, C = 0, D = 1, √(λ/2) = π/4, √(λ/3) = π/2\n\nSo, λ = (π/4)^2 * 2 = π^2/4.\n\nNow we can find T(t):\n\nT'(t) + (π^2/4)T(t) = 0\n\nThe solution to this differential equation is:\n\nT(t) = E*exp(-π^2*t/4)\n\nNow, we have the solution u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\nu(x, y, t) = sin(πx/4)sin(πy/2)exp(-π^2*t/4)\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature at the point (1, 1) at time t = 0.5 units:\n\nu(1, 1, 0.5) = sin(π*1/4)sin(π*1/2)exp(-π^2*0.5/4)\n\nu(1, 1, 0.5) ≈ 0.7071*1*exp(-π^2/8) ≈ 0.7071*exp(-1.2337) ≈ 0.7071*0.2905 ≈ 0.2053\n\nSo, the temperature at the point (1, 1) on the metal plate at time t = 0.5 units is approximately 0.2053 units."
