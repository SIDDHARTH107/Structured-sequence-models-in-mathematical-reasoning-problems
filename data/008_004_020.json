    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to transform the system into an upper triangular matrix and then solve it using back-substitution.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 4 & -3 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 3 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 7 & -6 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by 3, and subtract 7/3 times the second row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix. Let's use back-substitution to find the solutions:\n\nFrom the third equation, we have:\n\n$$\nz = 0\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\n$$\ny - z = y = 0\n$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\n$$\nx - y + z = x = 0\n$$\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\n$$\nx = 0, y = 0, z = 0\n$$"
