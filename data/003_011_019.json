The distance between the boats is 200 meters. Calculate the distance between the student and the closer boat.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the student and the closer boat as x meters, and the distance between the student and the farther boat as y meters. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles of elevation to the distances.\n\nFor the first boat (30 degrees angle of elevation):\ntan(30) = (x) / h\nwhere h is the height of the student's eye level above the ground.\n\nFor the second boat (45 degrees angle of elevation):\ntan(45) = (x + 200) / h\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the value of x.\n\nFirst, we can solve the first equation for h:\nh = x / tan(30)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for h into the second equation:\ntan(45) = (x + 200) / (x / tan(30))\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx * tan(45) = (x + 200) * tan(30)\n\nSince tan(45) = 1 and tan(30) = 1/sqrt(3):\nx = (x + 200) * (1/sqrt(3))\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3):\nx * sqrt(3) = x + 200\n\nNow, move x to the other side of the equation:\nx * (sqrt(3) - 1) = 200\n\nFinally, divide by (sqrt(3) - 1) to solve for x:\nx = 200 / (sqrt(3) - 1)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) + 1):\nx = (200 * (sqrt(3) + 1)) / (3 - 1)\n\nx = (200 * (sqrt(3) + 1)) / 2\n\nx = 100 * (sqrt(3) + 1)\n\nSo, the distance between the student and the closer boat is approximately 100 * (sqrt(3) + 1) meters."
