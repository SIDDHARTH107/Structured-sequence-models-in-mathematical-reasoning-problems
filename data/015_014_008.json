    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I must clarify that chaos theory is not the appropriate tool for calculating probabilities in this context. Chaos theory deals with the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, making long-term predictions difficult or impossible. However, it does not provide a direct method for calculating probabilities of specific outcomes.\n\nInstead, we can use the normal distribution to estimate the probability of the temperature being between 22°C and 26°C on Friday, assuming that the temperature follows a normal distribution with a mean of 20°C and a standard deviation of 2°C.\n\nTo do this, we can use the z-score formula to find the z-scores corresponding to 22°C and 26°C:\n\nz1 = (22 - 20) / 2 = 1\nz2 = (26 - 20) / 2 = 3\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The probability for z1 (1) is approximately 0.8413, and the probability for z2 (3) is approximately 0.9987.\n\nFinally, we can subtract the probability of z1 from the probability of z2 to find the probability of the temperature being between 22°C and 26°C on Friday:\n\nP(22°C < T < 26°C) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.9987 - 0.8413 = 0.1574\n\nSo, there is approximately a 15.74% chance that the temperature on Friday will be between 22°C and 26°C, assuming a normal distribution with a mean of 20°C and a standard deviation of 2°C. Keep in mind that this is a simplified approach and may not accurately represent the true probability due to the chaotic nature of weather systems."
