    "message_2": "To find the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the nth generation of the Apollonian gasket, we can use a recursive approach. Let S(n) represent the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the nth generation.\n\nFor the base case, n = 0, there is only one circle with curvature 1. So, S(0) = 1.\n\nFor n > 0, we have three new tangent circles for each circle in the previous generation. The curvatures of these new circles are -2, -2n, and 2(n+1). Since there are S(n-1) circles in the (n-1)th generation, there will be 3 * S(n-1) new circles in the nth generation.\n\nThe sum of the curvatures of these new circles is the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the nth generation minus the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the (n-1)th generation:\n\nS(n) - S(n-1) = 3 * S(n-1) * (-2 + (-2n) + 2(n+1))\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nS(n) - S(n-1) = 6 * S(n-1)\n\nS(n) = 7 * S(n-1)\n\nNow we can find the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the nth generation using the recursive formula:\n\nS(n) = 7 * S(n-1) = 7^n * S(0) = 7^n\n\nSo, the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the nth generation of the Apollonian gasket is 7^n."
