    "message_1": "A signal processing engineer is working on a project with a signal given as:\n\nf(t) = 5*sin(2*pi*5*t) + 10*sin(2*pi*10*t) + 15*sin(2*pi*15*t) \n\nWhat will be the result of applying the Fourier transform to this signal? Solve for the Fourier coefficients and plot the spectrum of the signal.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal, we first need to identify the individual sinusoidal components in the signal. The signal f(t) can be written as:\n\nf(t) = A1 * sin(2 * pi * f1 * t) + A2 * sin(2 * pi * f2 * t) + A3 * sin(2 * pi * f3 * t)\n\nwhere A1 = 5, f1 = 5 Hz, A2 = 10, f2 = 10 Hz, A3 = 15, and f3 = 15 Hz.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a continuous-time sinusoidal signal is given by a pair of impulses located at the positive and negative frequency of the sinusoid. The amplitude of the impulses is given by the amplitude of the sinusoid divided by 2. Therefore, the Fourier transform of f(t) will have impulses at frequencies -f1, f1, -f2, f2, -f3, and f3 with corresponding amplitudes A1/2, A1/2, A2/2, A2/2, A3/2, and A3/2.\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients for the given signal are:\n\n- At f = ±5 Hz: A1/2 = 5/2 = 2.5\n- At f = ±10 Hz: A2/2 = 10/2 = 5\n- At f = ±15 Hz: A3/2 = 15/2 = 7.5\n\nTo plot the spectrum of the signal, we can represent the Fourier coefficients as impulses on a frequency axis. The spectrum will have impulses at -15 Hz, -10 Hz, -5 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz with amplitudes 7.5, 5, 2.5, 2.5, 5, and 7.5, respectively.\n\nHere's a textual representation of the spectrum:\n\nAmplitude |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n          0    2.5  5    7.5  10   12.5 15   17.5\n          |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\nFrequency -15  -10  -5    0    5    10   15\n\nNote that this is a one-sided representation of the spectrum, and the actual spectrum would be symmetric around the frequency axis."
