    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The given system can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nWhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants (4, 12, 22).\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 4  4  3 |\n    | 6  9  5 |\n\nB = |  4  |\n    | 12  |\n    | 22  |\n\nStep 1: Decompose matrix A into L and U matrices.\n\nTo find L and U, we perform Gaussian elimination on A:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2 (the first element of the first row):\n\n    | 1   1.5  0.5 |\n    | 4   4    3   |\n    | 6   9    5   |\n\n2. Replace the second row with (-4 times the first row + second row) and the third row with (-6 times the first row + third row):\n\n    | 1   1.5   0.5  |\n    | 0  -2     1    |\n    | 0   0     2    |\n\nNow we have the U matrix:\n\nU = | 1   1.5   0.5  |\n    | 0  -2     1    |\n    | 0   0     2    |\n\nTo find the L matrix, we use the multipliers that we used during the Gaussian elimination:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 4  1  0 |\n    | 6  3  1 |\n\nStep 2: Solve the system L * Y = B for Y.\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   |  4  |\n| 4  1  0 | | y2 | = | 12  |\n| 6  3  1 | | y3 |   | 22  |\n\nBy forward substitution, we get:\n\ny1 = 4\ny2 = 12 - 4 * y1 = 12 - 16 = -4\ny3 = 22 - 6 * y1 - 3 * y2 = 22 - 24 + 12 = 10\n\nSo, Y = |  4  |\n        | -4  |\n        | 10  |\n\nStep 3: Solve the system U * X = Y for X.\n\n| 1   1.5   0.5  | | x |   |  4  |\n| 0  -2     1    | | y | = | -4  |\n| 0   0     2    | | z |   | 10  |\n\nBy backward substitution, we get:\n\nz = 10 / 2 = 5\ny = (-4 - 1 * z) / -2 = (-4 - 5) / -2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5\nx = 4 - 1.5 * y - 0.5 * z = 4 - 1.5 * 4.5 - 0.5 * 5 = 4 - 6.75 - 2.5 = -5.25\n\nSo, X = | -5.25 |\n        |  4.5   |\n        |  5     |\n\nRounding the answer to two decimal places, we get:\n\nx ≈ -5.25\ny ≈ 4.50\nz ≈ 5.00"
