    "message_1": "A company produces car batteries, and the probability of a battery being defective is 0.05. A technician tests 10 randomly selected batteries. What is the probability that exactly 2 batteries are defective?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective batteries\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective batteries from n total batteries, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of batteries tested (10 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective batteries we want to find the probability for (2 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a battery being defective (0.05 in this case)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a battery not being defective (0.95 in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(10, 2) * 0.05^2 * 0.95^8\n\nFirst, we calculate C(10, 2):\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45\n\nNow, we calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = 45 * 0.05^2 * 0.95^8 â‰ˆ 0.375\n\nSo, the probability of exactly 2 batteries being defective out of the 10 tested is approximately 0.375 or 37.5%."
