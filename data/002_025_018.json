    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the length of the equal sides of an isosceles triangle whose base measures 12 cm and angle opposite to the base is 40 degrees. What is the length of each of the equal sides of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle, we can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle.\n\nLet's denote the length of the equal sides as x, and the angles opposite to the equal sides as A and B. Since the triangle is isosceles, A = B. The angle opposite to the base is given as 40 degrees, so we can find the value of A and B using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nA + B + 40 = 180\nA + B = 140\nSince A = B,\n2A = 140\nA = 70 degrees\n\nNow we can apply the Law of Sines:\n\nx / sin(40) = 12 / sin(70)\n\nTo find x, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = (12 / sin(70)) * sin(40)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate x:\n\nx ≈ (12 / 0.9397) * 0.6428\nx ≈ 8.196\n\nSo, the length of each of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle is approximately 8.196 cm."
