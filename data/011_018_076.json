    "message_1": "A designer needs to make ten teams, each consisting of four players, for a soccer tournament. Every player must be in exactly one team. How many different ways can the designer arrange the teams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. Since there are 10 teams with 4 players each, there must be a total of 40 players. We need to divide these 40 players into 10 groups of 4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to choose 4 players out of 40 for the first team. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(40, 4) = 40! / (4!(40-4)!) = 91,390\n\nNow, we have 36 players left for the remaining 9 teams. We can repeat this process for each team:\n\nC(36, 4) = 58905\nC(32, 4) = 35,960\nC(28, 4) = 20,475\nC(24, 4) = 10,626\nC(20, 4) = 4,845\nC(16, 4) = 1,820\nC(12, 4) = 495\nC(8, 4) = 70\nC(4, 4) = 1\n\nNow, we need to multiply all these combinations together to find the total number of ways to arrange the teams:\n\n91,390 * 58,905 * 35,960 * 20,475 * 10,626 * 4,845 * 1,820 * 495 * 70 * 1 = 3,315,954,312,850\n\nSo, there are 3,315,954,312,850 different ways for the designer to arrange the teams."
