    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of all apples produced by the orchard, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean = 150 grams\nZ = Z-score for a 95% confidence interval = 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table)\nσ = sample standard deviation = 20 grams\nn = sample size = 50 apples\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 20 / √50 ≈ 2.83 grams\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 2.83 ≈ 5.54 grams\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nLower limit = x̄ - ME = 150 - 5.54 ≈ 144.46 grams\nUpper limit = x̄ + ME = 150 + 5.54 ≈ 155.54 grams\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of all apples produced by the orchard is approximately (144.46 grams, 155.54 grams)."
