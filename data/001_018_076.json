    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog(base 2) (x * (x - 6)) = 4\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log(base b) a = c, then a = b^c. In this case, we have:\n\nx * (x - 6) = 2^4\n\nx * (x - 6) = 16\n\nNow, we can solve for x by expanding the equation and setting it to zero:\n\nx^2 - 6x - 16 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -6, and c = -16:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-16))) / (2 * 1)\n\nx = (6 ± √(36 + 64)) / 2\n\nx = (6 ± √100) / 2\n\nx = (6 ± 10) / 2\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\nx = (6 + 10) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8\n\nx = (6 - 10) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2\n\nHowever, since we have a logarithm of (x-6) in the original equation, we need to make sure that x-6 > 0, otherwise the logarithm would be undefined. This means that x > 6. Therefore, the only valid solution is:\n\nx = 8"
