    "message_2": "We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of the group G of order 25.\n\nSince 25 = 5^2, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G must divide 25/5^2 = 1 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup, say H, of order 5^2 = 25. Since H is the only 5-Sylow subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the factor group G/H. Since H is of order 25, the order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 25/25 = 1. Thus, G/H is the trivial group, which implies that G is isomorphic to H.\n\nSince H is a group of order 25, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. To determine which case holds, we will use the fact that a group of order p^2 (where p is a prime) is always abelian.\n\nLet a and b be two elements of H. Since H is of order 25, the orders of a and b must be divisors of 25, which are 1, 5, and 25. If the orders of both a and b are 5, then H is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. If either a or b has order 25, then H is cyclic.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that H is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. Then H would be isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_5, where Z_5 is the cyclic group of order 5. However, Z_5 × Z_5 has 25 elements, and each element (a, b) has order lcm(|a|, |b|), where |a| and |b| are the orders of a and b in Z_5. Since the maximum order of an element in Z_5 is 5, the maximum order of an element in Z_5 × Z_5 is also 5. This means that there is no element of order 25 in Z_5 × Z_5, which contradicts the fact that H is cyclic.\n\nTherefore, H must be cyclic, and since G is isomorphic to H, G is also cyclic."
