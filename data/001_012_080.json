    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the common factor of x from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(4x^2 - 12x) / (2x^3 - 14x^2 + 20x) = x(4x - 12) / x(2x^2 - 14x + 20)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor of x:\n\nx(4x - 12) / x(2x^2 - 14x + 20) = (4x - 12) / (2x^2 - 14x + 20)\n\nNext, we can factor out the common factor of 2 from the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(4x - 12) / (2x^2 - 14x + 20) = 2(2x - 6) / 2(x^2 - 7x + 10)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor of 2:\n\n2(2x - 6) / 2(x^2 - 7x + 10) = (2x - 6) / (x^2 - 7x + 10)\n\nFinally, we can factor the denominator:\n\n(x^2 - 7x + 10) = (x - 2)(x - 5)\n\nSo the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(2x - 6) / ((x - 2)(x - 5))"
