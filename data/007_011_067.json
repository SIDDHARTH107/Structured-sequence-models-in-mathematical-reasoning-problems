    "message_2": "Since p = 17 is a prime number and 17 ≡ 1 (mod 4), we can use the properties of quadratic residues to find the value of x.\n\nBy Euler's Criterion, we have:\n\nx^((p-1)/2) ≡ (x^((17-1)/2)) ≡ x^8 ≡ -1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we need to find an x that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trying different values of x and checking if the equation holds true.\n\nLet's start with x = 1:\n\n1^8 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nThis does not satisfy the equation, so let's try x = 2:\n\n2^8 ≡ 256 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nThis also does not satisfy the equation. Let's try x = 3:\n\n3^8 ≡ 6561 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n\nThis satisfies the equation since 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17). Therefore, x = 3 is a solution.\n\nHowever, there is another solution. Since x^2 ≡ -1 (mod 17), we can also have -x^2 ≡ -1 (mod 17). In this case, -x = -3, so x = 14 is also a solution.\n\nThus, the two values of x that satisfy the equation x^2 ≡ -1 (mod 17) are x = 3 and x = 14."
