    "message_2": "To find the cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn this graph, we can identify the following cut vertices and bridges:\n\nCut vertices: 2, 5\nBridges: (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 3)\n\nNow, let's remove these cut vertices and bridges from the graph:\n\n```\n      5     4\n           \n           \n   1     2     3\n```\n\nAfter removing the cut vertices and bridges, we have 4 connected components remaining in the graph:\n\n1. Vertex 1\n2. Vertex 2\n3. Vertex 3\n4. Vertices 4 and 5\n\nSo, there are 4 connected components remaining in the graph after removing the cut vertices and bridges."
