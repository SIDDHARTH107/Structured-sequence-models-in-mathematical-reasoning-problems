    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 7 heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (heads)\n- p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (1 - p = 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 10, k = 7, p = 0.5, and q = 0.5.\n\nFirst, we calculate nCk:\n10C7 = 10! / (7!(10-7)!) = 10! / (7!3!) = 120\n\nNext, we calculate p^k and q^(n-k):\np^k = 0.5^7 = 0.0078125\nq^(n-k) = 0.5^3 = 0.125\n\nFinally, we multiply these values together:\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.0078125 * 0.125 = 0.1171875\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 7 heads in 10 coin flips is approximately 11.72%."
