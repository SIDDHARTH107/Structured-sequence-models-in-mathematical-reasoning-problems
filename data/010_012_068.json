Define a function $f:S\\to\\mathbb{R}$ as $f(x,y)= x^3 - 3xy^2$. \n\nDetermine whether the function $f$ is smooth or not on $S$.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the function $f$ is smooth on $S$, we need to check if its partial derivatives exist and are continuous on $S$. \n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy$\n\nNow, let's check if these partial derivatives are continuous on $S$. Since $S$ is the set of all points $(x, y)$ such that $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, we can substitute $y^2 = 1 - x^2$ into the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3(1 - x^2) = 6x^2 - 3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy$\n\nBoth of these expressions are polynomials in $x$ and $y$, and polynomials are continuous everywhere in their domain. Therefore, the partial derivatives are continuous on $S$.\n\nSince the partial derivatives exist and are continuous on $S$, the function $f$ is smooth on $S$."
