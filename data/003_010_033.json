    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation of the sun is 60 degrees, the shadow (adjacent side) is 30 meters, and we want to find the height of the building (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 30\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30:\n\nheight = 30 * tan(60°)\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is √3, so:\n\nheight = 30 * √3 ≈ 51.96\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 52 meters."
