    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the function y = x^2 + 3x + 2 at the point (-1, 4), we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = -1.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 3x + 2.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2)/dx + d(3x)/dx + d(2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule and the constant rule, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 2x + 3 + 0\n\ndy/dx = 2x + 3\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = -1:\n\ndy/dx(-1) = 2(-1) + 3\n\ndy/dx(-1) = -2 + 3\n\ndy/dx(-1) = 1\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the function y = x^2 + 3x + 2 at the point (-1, 4) is 1."
