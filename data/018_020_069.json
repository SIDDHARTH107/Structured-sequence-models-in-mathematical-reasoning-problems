    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of set A and set B, and then find the union of that result with set {3, 4, 6}. Finally, find the symmetric difference of set A with the union of set B and set {3, 4, 6}. Verify if the result shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of set A and set B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the symmetric difference with the set {3, 4, 6}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ {3, 4, 6} = {1, 5} ∪ {3, 4, 6} = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the union of set B and set {3, 4, 6}.\n\nB ∪ {3, 4, 6} = {2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {3, 4, 6} = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of set A with the union of set B and set {3, 4, 6}.\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ {3, 4, 6}) = (A ∪ (B ∪ {3, 4, 6})) - (A ∩ (B ∪ {3, 4, 6}))\n\nA ∪ (B ∪ {3, 4, 6}) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ (B ∪ {3, 4, 6}) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ {3, 4, 6}) = {1, 5, 6} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nSince the result of (A ∆ B) ∪ {3, 4, 6} is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6} and the result of A ∆ (B ∪ {3, 4, 6}) is {1, 5}, the two results are not equal. Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over union."
