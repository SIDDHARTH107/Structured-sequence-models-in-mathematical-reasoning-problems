    "message_1": "Consider a market with two firms that produce identical goods at the same cost. Each firm decides on its quantity of output, which is then sold at the market price. Assuming a Cournot competition, find the Nash equilibrium quantity and price if the inverse demand function is given by P = 100 - Q, where Q is the total quantity produced in the market. The cost function for each firm is C(q) = 10q, where q is the individual quantity produced by each firm.",
    "message_2": "Let q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2. The inverse demand function is P = 100 - Q.\n\nThe revenue for each firm is given by R(q) = P*q, where P is the price and q is the quantity produced by the firm. Therefore, the revenue functions for firm 1 and firm 2 are:\n\nR1(q1) = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1\nR2(q2) = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q2\n\nThe profit function for each firm is given by π(q) = R(q) - C(q), where C(q) is the cost function. Using the given cost function C(q) = 10q, we have the profit functions for firm 1 and firm 2:\n\nπ1(q1) = R1(q1) - 10q1 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 10q1\nπ2(q2) = R2(q2) - 10q2 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 10q2\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find the best response functions for each firm. We do this by taking the first-order partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to the quantities produced by each firm and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂π1/∂q1 = 100 - 2q1 - q2 - 10 = 0\n∂π2/∂q2 = 100 - q1 - 2q2 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nq1 = 30 - (1/2)q2\nq2 = 30 - (1/2)q1\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\nq2 = 30 - (1/2)(30 - (1/2)q2)\nq2 = 30 - 15 + (1/4)q2\n(3/4)q2 = 15\nq2 = 20\n\nNow, substituting the value of q2 back into the first equation, we get:\n\nq1 = 30 - (1/2)(20)\nq1 = 30 - 10\nq1 = 20\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium quantities for firm 1 and firm 2 are q1* = 20 and q2* = 20.\n\nNow, we can find the Nash equilibrium price by substituting these equilibrium quantities into the inverse demand function:\n\nP* = 100 - Q* = 100 - (q1* + q2*) = 100 - (20 + 20) = 100 - 40 = 60\n\nThus, the Nash equilibrium price is P* = 60."
