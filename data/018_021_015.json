    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {3, 4} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection of (A △ B) and {3, 4}:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {3, 4} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nSo, (A △ B) ∩ {3, 4} = ∅.\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection. We want to show that:\n\nA △ (B ∩ C) = (A △ B) ∩ (A △ C)\n\nProof:\n\nA △ (B ∩ C) = (A - (B ∩ C)) ∪ ((B ∩ C) - A)\n(A △ B) ∩ (A △ C) = ((A - B) ∪ (B - A)) ∩ ((A - C) ∪ (C - A))\n\nNow, we can rewrite the right side using the distributive property of intersection over union:\n\n(A - B) ∩ (A - C) ∪ (A - B) ∩ (C - A) ∪ (B - A) ∩ (A - C) ∪ (B - A) ∩ (C - A)\n\nNow, we can observe that:\n\n(A - B) ∩ (A - C) = A - (B ∪ C)\n(A - B) ∩ (C - A) = C - (A ∪ B)\n(B - A) ∩ (A - C) = B - (A ∪ C)\n(B - A) ∩ (C - A) = (B ∩ C) - A\n\nNow, we can rewrite the right side as:\n\nA - (B ∪ C) ∪ C - (A ∪ B) ∪ B - (A ∪ C) ∪ (B ∩ C) - A\n\nNow, we can observe that this is equal to:\n\n(A - (B ∩ C)) ∪ ((B ∩ C) - A)\n\nWhich is equal to A △ (B ∩ C). Thus, we have shown that:\n\nA △ (B ∩ C) = (A △ B) ∩ (A △ C)\n\nThis proves that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection."
