    "message_1": "Suppose you are given the trig function f(x) = 3sin(2x - π/4) - 1. What is the phase shift of this function?",
    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 3sin(2x - π/4) - 1. To find the phase shift, we need to look at the argument of the sine function, which is (2x - π/4).\n\nThe general form of a sine function is A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, the function is already in the general form with A = 3, B = 2, and D = -1. The argument of the sine function is 2(x - π/8), so the phase shift C is π/8.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x - π/4) - 1 is π/8."
