    "message_1": "In a dictator game, Player A is given 10 dollars to share with Player B. If Player A decides to keep 6 dollars for themselves, what is the minimum amount they can offer Player B, while still keeping Player B better off than they would be if Player A kept all 10 dollars?",
    "message_2": "In order for Player B to be better off than if Player A kept all 10 dollars, Player B must receive at least some amount greater than 0 dollars. The minimum amount Player A can offer Player B while still keeping them better off is 1 cent (0.01 dollars), as this is the smallest unit of currency greater than 0 dollars. In this case, Player A would keep 5.99 dollars for themselves."
