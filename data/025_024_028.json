    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the equation x^2 - y^2 = 4 as (x+y)(x-y) = 4. Now, let's analyze the transformations given:\n\n1. (x,y) -> (x+y, y): This transformation corresponds to replacing x with x+y. Applying this transformation to the equation (x+y)(x-y) = 4, we get ((x+y)+y)((x+y)-y) = 4, which simplifies to (x+2y)(x) = 4. \n\n2. (x,y) -> (-x, y): This transformation corresponds to replacing x with -x. Applying this transformation to the equation (x+y)(x-y) = 4, we get ((-x)+y)((-x)-y) = 4, which simplifies to (-x+y)(-x-y) = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of G on the set of solutions of the equation x^2 - y^2 = 4. The orbit of a point (x,y) under G is the set of all points that can be obtained by applying the transformations in G to (x,y) any number of times. \n\nLet (x', y') be a point in the orbit of (x, y). Then, (x', y') can be obtained by applying the transformations (x,y) -> (x+y, y) and (x,y) -> (-x, y) any number of times. \n\nWe can represent the action of G on (x, y) as a sequence of transformations, where 'A' denotes the transformation (x,y) -> (x+y, y) and 'B' denotes the transformation (x,y) -> (-x, y). For example, the sequence 'ABA' corresponds to applying the transformation (x,y) -> (x+y, y), then (x,y) -> (-x, y), and finally (x,y) -> (x+y, y) again.\n\nNotice that applying the transformation (x,y) -> (-x, y) twice in a row results in the original point (x, y). Therefore, we can ignore any 'BB' in the sequence, as it has no effect on the point. Thus, we only need to consider sequences of the form 'A', 'BA', 'BABA', 'BABABA', and so on.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of these sequences on (x, y):\n\n1. 'A': (x', y') = (x+y, y)\n2. 'BA': (x', y') = (-x+y, y)\n3. 'BABA': (x', y') = (-x+2y, y)\n4. 'BABABA': (x', y') = (x+3y, y)\n5. 'BABABABA': (x', y') = (-x+4y, y)\nAnd so on.\n\nWe can see that the orbit of (x, y) consists of points of the form (x+ny, y) and (-x+ny, y), where n is an integer. \n\nNow, let's find the orbit space of G acting on the set of solutions of the equation x^2 - y^2 = 4. The orbit space is the set of distinct orbits under the action of G. Since the orbit of (x, y) consists of points of the form (x+ny, y) and (-x+ny, y), we can choose a representative from each orbit by setting n = 0. This gives us the points (x, y) and (-x, y), which satisfy the equation x^2 - y^2 = 4.\n\nThe orbit space of G acting on the set of solutions of the equation x^2 - y^2 = 4 in the (x,y)-plane is the set of points {(x, y), (-x, y) | x^2 - y^2 = 4}."
