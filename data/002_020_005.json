    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector with a central angle of 120 degrees, we need to find the length of the arc and the two radii that form the sector.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 14 inches, the radius (r) is half of that:\n\nr = 14 / 2 = 7 inches\n\nNow, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc (s) is:\n\ns = (θ/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees and r is the radius. In this case, θ = 120 degrees and r = 7 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (120/360) * 2π(7)\ns = (1/3) * 14π\ns = 14π/3 inches\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the sector. The perimeter (P) is the sum of the arc length and the two radii:\n\nP = s + 2r\nP = (14π/3) + 2(7)\nP = 14π/3 + 14\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector with a central angle of 120 degrees is 14π/3 + 14 inches."
