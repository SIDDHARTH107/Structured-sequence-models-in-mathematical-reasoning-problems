    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven the radius r = 7 centimeters, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2πr\nC = 2 × 3.14159 × 7\nC ≈ 43.98226 centimeters\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 43.98 centimeters."
