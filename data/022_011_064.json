    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz + 1 = 0\nz = -1\n\nSo, there is one zero at z = -1.\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function by finding the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 4z - 21 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = ( -b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -21. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = ( 4 ± sqrt((-4)^2 - 4(1)(-21)) ) / 2(1)\nz = ( 4 ± sqrt(100) ) / 2\nz = ( 4 ± 10 ) / 2\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\nz = ( 4 + 10 ) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7\nz = ( 4 - 10 ) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3\n\nSo, there are two poles at z = 7 and z = -3.\n\nNow, let's classify the zeros and poles. Since the zero at z = -1 is not a pole, it is a removable singularity. The poles at z = 7 and z = -3 are simple poles because the denominator is a quadratic polynomial, and the highest power of (z - 7) and (z + 3) in the denominator is 1.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Zero at z = -1: removable singularity\n- Pole at z = 7: simple pole\n- Pole at z = -3: simple pole"
