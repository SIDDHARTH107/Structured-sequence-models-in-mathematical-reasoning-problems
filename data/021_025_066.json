    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. However, it is not feasible to demonstrate the entire WOA process in this text-based format. Instead, I will provide a brief overview of the algorithm and then solve the given optimization problem analytically.\n\nWOA consists of several steps, including initialization, updating the position of whales, and updating the leader. The algorithm iteratively searches for the optimal solution by simulating the hunting behavior of whales, such as encircling prey, bubble-net attacking, and searching for prey.\n\nNow, let's solve the given optimization problem analytically:\n\nObjective function: f(x) = (x - 3)^2 - 5\nConstraint: g(x) = x^2 - 4x = 0\n\nFirst, let's find the values of x that satisfy the constraint g(x) = 0:\n\nx^2 - 4x = 0\nx(x - 4) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 0 and x = 4.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the objective function f(x) at these two points:\n\nf(0) = (0 - 3)^2 - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4\nf(4) = (4 - 3)^2 - 5 = 1 - 5 = -4\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) is -4, which occurs at x = 4. Therefore, the solution to the optimization problem is x = 4 with a minimum value of f(x) = -4."
