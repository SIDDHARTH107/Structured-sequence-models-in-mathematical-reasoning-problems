    "message_2": "To solve the equation `2^(3x) = 16`, we can first rewrite 16 as a power of 2. Since 16 = 2^4, the equation becomes:\n\n2^(3x) = 2^4\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n3x = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n\nx = 4/3\n\nSo, the solution for x is 4/3."
