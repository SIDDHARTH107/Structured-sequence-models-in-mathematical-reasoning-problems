    "message_1": "A small freight company has to deliver packages to different locations. The company has two delivery trucks that can carry 10 packages each. There are 15 packages to be delivered to four different locations, with the following amounts: 5 packages to Location A, 3 packages to Location B, 4 packages to Location C, and 3 packages to Location D. What is the optimal way to load the trucks to deliver all the packages while minimizing the number of trips?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of trips, we should try to load the trucks in such a way that each truck can deliver packages to two different locations in one trip. Here's an optimal way to load the trucks:\n\nTruck 1: 5 packages to Location A + 3 packages to Location B (Total: 8 packages)\nTruck 2: 4 packages to Location C + 3 packages to Location D (Total: 7 packages)\n\nIn this way, both trucks can deliver all the packages in just one trip each."
