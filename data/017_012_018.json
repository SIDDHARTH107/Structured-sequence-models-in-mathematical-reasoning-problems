In this case, p = 2. We will analyze the possible structures of groups of order 16 based on their composition factors.\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 16: Z_16\nThis group is generated by a single element of order 16. It is abelian since all cyclic groups are abelian.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and 4: Z_4 x Z_4\nThis group is also abelian since the direct product of abelian groups is abelian. It is non-isomorphic to Z_16 because it does not have an element of order 16.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2: Z_8 x Z_2\nThis group is abelian as well. It is non-isomorphic to the previous two groups because it has an element of order 8 but not an element of order 16.\n\nNow, we will show that there are no other non-isomorphic groups of order 16. Suppose there exists another group G of order 16. Then G must have a non-trivial center, as it is a p-group. Let Z(G) denote the center of G. We consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: |Z(G)| = 16\nIn this case, G is abelian, and its composition factors must be among {2, 4, 8, 16}. However, we have already listed all abelian groups of order 16, so G must be isomorphic to one of the groups listed above.\n\nCase 2: |Z(G)| = 8\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 2, which implies that G is a semi-direct product of Z(G) and a subgroup of order 2. However, since Z(G) is abelian, the semi-direct product is actually a direct product, and G is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_2, which we have already listed.\n\nCase 3: |Z(G)| = 4\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 4. However, since G is a p-group, G/Z(G) must be a cyclic group of order 4. This implies that G has a normal subgroup of order 4, say N. Then G/N is also a group of order 4, and G is a semi-direct product of N and G/N. However, since N is abelian, the semi-direct product is actually a direct product, and G is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_4, which we have already listed.\n\nCase 4: |Z(G)| = 2\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 8. However, since G is a p-group, G/Z(G) must be a cyclic group of order 8. This implies that G has a normal subgroup of order 8, say N. Then G/N is also a group of order 2, and G is a semi-direct product of N and G/N. However, since N is abelian, the semi-direct product is actually a direct product, and G is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_2, which we have already listed.\n\nIn all cases, G is isomorphic to one of the three groups we have listed. Therefore, there are exactly three non-isomorphic groups of order 16: Z_16, Z_4 x Z_4, and Z_8 x Z_2. All of these groups are abelian, and none of them are non-abelian."
