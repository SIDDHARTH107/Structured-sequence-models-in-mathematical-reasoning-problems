    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Chua circuit system, we first need to obtain the equations that describe the system. The Chua circuit system is described by the following three differential equations:\n\n1. dV1/dt = (1/C1) * (V2 - V1 - h(V1))\n2. dV2/dt = (1/C2) * (V1 - V2 + R * iL)\n3. diL/dt = -(1/L) * V2\n\nWhere V1 and V2 are the voltages across the capacitors C1 and C2, iL is the current through the inductor L, and h(V1) is the piecewise-linear function representing the nonlinear resistor:\n\nh(V1) = m0 * V1 + 0.5 * (m1 - m0) * (|V1 + β| - |V1 - β|)\n\nNow, to find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to linearize the system around its equilibrium points and compute the Jacobian matrix. Then, we need to find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix and take the maximum real part of these eigenvalues as the maximum Lyapunov exponent.\n\nHowever, this process is quite involved and requires numerical methods to solve the equations and find the eigenvalues. It is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response to provide an exact value for the maximum Lyapunov exponent. I recommend using specialized software like MATLAB or Python with appropriate libraries (e.g., SciPy) to perform these calculations."
