    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we can integrate the given equations with respect to $x$ and $y$.\n\nFirst, let's integrate the first equation with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\int u_x dx = \\int v_y dx$$\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\int v_y dx + g(y)$$\n\nwhere $g(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$.\n\nNow, let's integrate the second equation with respect to $y$:\n\n$$\\int u_y dy = -\\int v_x dy$$\n\n$$u(x, y) = -\\int v_x dy + h(x)$$\n\nwhere $h(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nNow, we have two expressions for $u(x, y)$. Let's equate them:\n\n$$\\int v_y dx + g(y) = -\\int v_x dy + h(x)$$\n\nNow, let's differentiate both sides with respect to $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(\\int v_y dx + g(y)\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(-\\int v_x dy + h(x)\\right)$$\n\n$$v_y + g'(y) = -v_x$$\n\nNow, we can express $v(x, y)$ in terms of $u(x, y)$:\n\n$$v(x, y) = -\\int g'(y) dy + \\int u_x dx$$\n\nThe general solution of the Cauchy-Riemann equations is given by the complex-valued function:\n\n$$f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = \\left(\\int v_y dx + g(y)\\right) + i\\left(-\\int g'(y) dy + \\int u_x dx\\right)$$\n\nwhere $g(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$, and $g'(y)$ is its derivative with respect to $y$."
