    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product X and Product Y. The profit margin for each unit of Product X is $5 and for each unit of Product Y is $7. The company has 150 units of raw material A, 90 units of raw material B, and 120 units of raw material C available. Each unit of Product X requires 2 units of raw material A, 1 unit of raw material B, and 1 unit of raw material C, while each unit of Product Y requires 1 unit of raw material A, 2 units of raw material B, and 1 unit of raw material C. What is the maximum profit that the company can earn by producing both products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product X and y be the number of units of Product Y.\n\nThe profit function is given by P(x, y) = 5x + 7y.\n\nThe constraints for the raw materials are as follows:\n\n1. Raw material A: 2x + y ≤ 150\n2. Raw material B: x + 2y ≤ 90\n3. Raw material C: x + y ≤ 120\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph.\n\n1. Raw material A: y ≤ -2x + 150\n2. Raw material B: y ≤ -0.5x + 45\n3. Raw material C: y ≤ -x + 120\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities, which is a convex polygon with vertices at the points (0, 0), (0, 45), (30, 60), (60, 30), and (75, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 45) = 5(0) + 7(45) = $315\n3. P(30, 60) = 5(30) + 7(60) = $570\n4. P(60, 30) = 5(60) + 7(30) = $510\n5. P(75, 0) = 5(75) + 7(0) = $375\n\nThe maximum profit is $570, which occurs when the company produces 30 units of Product X and 60 units of Product Y."
