    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The production of each product requires a certain amount of raw materials and labor hours. Product A requires 1 unit of raw material and 2 labor hours, while product B requires 2 units of raw material and 1 labor hour. The company has 100 units of raw material and 80 labor hours available for production. Product A is sold for $5 per unit, and Product B is sold for $7 per unit. What is the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n1 unit of raw material for Product A: x\n2 units of raw material for Product B: 2y\nTotal raw material: x + 2y ≤ 100\n\n2 labor hours for Product A: 2x\n1 labor hour for Product B: y\nTotal labor hours: 2x + y ≤ 80\n\nSince x and y represent the number of units produced, they must be non-negative:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe company's revenue is given by the sum of the revenue from Product A and Product B:\nRevenue = 5x + 7y\n\nTo maximize the revenue, we will use the method of linear programming. First, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + 2y ≤ 100\n2. 2x + y ≤ 80\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 50), (40, 0), and (20, 40). We will now evaluate the revenue function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. (0, 0): Revenue = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\n2. (0, 50): Revenue = 5(0) + 7(50) = $350\n3. (40, 0): Revenue = 5(40) + 7(0) = $200\n4. (20, 40): Revenue = 5(20) + 7(40) = $100 + $280 = $380\n\nThe maximum revenue of $380 is achieved when the company produces 20 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B."
