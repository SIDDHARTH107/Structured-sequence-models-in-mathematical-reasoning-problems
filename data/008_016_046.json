    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Jacobi iterative method, we first rewrite the given equations in the form of x, y, and z:\n\nx = 6 - 2y - z\ny = (14 - 2x - 2z) / 5\nz = 8 - x - y\n\nNow, we will use the initial approximations x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, and z(0) = 0 and iterate through the Jacobi method:\n\nIteration 1:\nx(1) = 6 - 2(0) - 0 = 6\ny(1) = (14 - 2(0) - 2(0)) / 5 = 2.8\nz(1) = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8\n\nIteration 2:\nx(2) = 6 - 2(2.8) - 8 = -3.6\ny(2) = (14 - 2(6) - 2(8)) / 5 = -2.8\nz(2) = 8 - 6 - 2.8 = -0.8\n\nIteration 3:\nx(3) = 6 - 2(-2.8) - (-0.8) = 12.4\ny(3) = (14 - 2(-3.6) - 2(-0.8)) / 5 = 5.6\nz(3) = 8 - (-3.6) - (-2.8) = 14.4\n\nWe can continue iterating until the values converge to a solution or until a desired level of accuracy is reached. It's important to note that the Jacobi method does not guarantee convergence for all systems of linear equations. In this case, the values do not seem to be converging quickly, and it may be more efficient to use another method, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the method of successive over-relaxation (SOR), to solve the system of linear equations."
