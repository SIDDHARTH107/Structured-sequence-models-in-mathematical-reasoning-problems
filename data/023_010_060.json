    "message_2": "To perform a 2D Fourier transform on a 512x512 image using MATLAB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the image into MATLAB:\n\n```matlab\nimg = imread('your_image_file.png');\n```\n\n2. Convert the image to grayscale if it's not already:\n\n```matlab\nif size(img, 3) == 3\n    img_gray = rgb2gray(img);\nelse\n    img_gray = img;\nend\n```\n\n3. Perform the 2D Fourier transform:\n\n```matlab\nimg_fft = fft2(double(img_gray));\n```\n\n4. Shift the zero-frequency component to the center of the spectrum:\n\n```matlab\nimg_fft_shifted = fftshift(img_fft);\n```\n\n5. Compute the magnitude spectrum:\n\n```matlab\nmagnitude_spectrum = abs(img_fft_shifted);\n```\n\n6. Plot the magnitude spectrum:\n\n```matlab\nfigure;\nimshow(log(1 + magnitude_spectrum), []);\ntitle('Magnitude Spectrum');\n```\n\nTo identify the frequency corresponding to the horizontal and vertical edges of the image, look for peaks in the magnitude spectrum plot. The peaks will be located at the frequencies corresponding to the dominant spatial features in the image, such as edges.\n\nFor example, if there is a strong horizontal edge in the image, there will be a peak in the magnitude spectrum at a frequency corresponding to that edge. Similarly, if there is a strong vertical edge, there will be a peak at the corresponding frequency.\n\nTo find the exact frequency values, you can use the `findpeaks` function in MATLAB:\n\n```matlab\n[pks_hor, locs_hor] = findpeaks(magnitude_spectrum(256, :));\n[pks_ver, locs_ver] = findpeaks(magnitude_spectrum(:, 256));\n```\n\nThis will give you the peak values (`pks_hor` and `pks_ver`) and their locations (`locs_hor` and `locs_ver`) along the horizontal and vertical centerlines of the magnitude spectrum. The locations correspond to the frequencies of the horizontal and vertical edges in the image."
