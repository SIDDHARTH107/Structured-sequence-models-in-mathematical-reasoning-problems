    "message_2": "In a paraconsistent logic system, statements can have truth values between 0 (completely false) and 1 (completely true). In this case, P has a truth value of 1/2.\n\nTo find the truth value for \"P and not P\", we need to consider the truth values for both P and not P. Since P has a truth value of 1/2, not P will also have a truth value of 1/2 (as it is the negation of P).\n\nIn paraconsistent logic, the truth value of \"P and not P\" is usually determined by taking the minimum of the truth values of P and not P. So, the truth value for \"P and not P\" will be:\n\nmin(1/2, 1/2) = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the truth value for \"P and not P\" in this paraconsistent logic system is 1/2."
