In this case, the union of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, let's confirm that set A and set B are subsets of the union:\n\nA subset of a set is a set that contains only elements from the original set. In this case, all elements of set A are in the union:\n\n1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSimilarly, all elements of set B are in the union:\n\n2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set A and set B are in the union, we can confirm that set A and set B are subsets of the union A ∪ B."
