    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to optimize the production of two products, A and B. Suppose the company can produce product A at a profit of $10 per unit, and product B at a profit of $15 per unit. The manufacturing process involves two machines, Machine X and Machine Y, with different production times for each product as shown in the table below. \n\n|   | Machine X | Machine Y |\n|---|---|---|\n| Product A | 3 minutes | 4 minutes |\n| Product B | 5 minutes | 3 minutes |\n\nMachine X can operate for at most 220 minutes a day, while machine Y can operate for at most 180 minutes a day. How many units of each product should the company produce daily to maximize their profit? Use the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function.\n2. Initialize the population of cuckoo nests.\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each nest.\n4. Perform the search process.\n5. Update the best solution found.\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function\nThe objective function is the profit function, which we want to maximize. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 5y <= 220 (Machine X constraint)\n4x + 3y <= 180 (Machine Y constraint)\nx, y >= 0 (Non-negative production)\n\nStep 2: Initialize the population of cuckoo nests\nGenerate an initial population of n nests (solutions) randomly, ensuring that they satisfy the constraints. For example, we can start with n=25 nests.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the fitness of each nest\nCalculate the profit for each nest (x, y) using the profit function P(x, y) and store the results.\n\nStep 4: Perform the search process\nPerform the cuckoo search algorithm by following these steps:\n\na. Select a nest randomly and generate a new solution by applying a random walk (Levy flight) to the selected nest.\nb. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\nc. If the new solution has better fitness (higher profit) than the worst nest in the population, replace the worst nest with the new solution.\nd. Randomly choose a fraction of the nests and replace them with new nests generated randomly.\ne. Repeat steps a-d for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nStep 5: Update the best solution found\nDuring the search process, keep track of the best solution (nest) found so far, which corresponds to the highest profit.\n\nAfter completing the cuckoo search algorithm, the best solution found will be the optimal number of units of products A and B to produce daily to maximize the profit.\n\nNote: The cuckoo search algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the solution may not be the exact optimal solution. However, it is expected to provide a near-optimal solution for this problem."
