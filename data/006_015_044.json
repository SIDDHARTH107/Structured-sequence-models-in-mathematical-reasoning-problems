    "message_1": "Suppose a company's network receives an average of 10,000 cyber attacks per month. The company's security team estimates that 80% of these attacks are brute force attacks, 15% are ransomware attacks, and the remaining 5% are phishing attacks. \n\nWhat is the probability that in a given month, there will be at least 1 ransomware attack on the company's network? Round your answer to the nearest thousandth.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 1 ransomware attack in a given month, we can first find the probability of no ransomware attacks and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single attack not being ransomware is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\n\nThere are 10,000 cyber attacks per month, so the probability of none of them being ransomware is (0.85)^10000.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least 1 ransomware attack:\n\n1 - (0.85)^10000 ≈ 1 - 1.93 * 10^(-217) ≈ 1.\n\nSo, the probability of at least 1 ransomware attack in a given month is approximately 1, or 100%."
