    "message_1": "A cube with sides measuring 7 cm each is painted on all its faces. What is the total surface area that was painted?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and the surface area of each face can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area of a face = side length × side length\n\nSince the side length of the cube is 7 cm, the surface area of one face is:\n\nSurface area of a face = 7 cm × 7 cm = 49 square cm\n\nNow, to find the total surface area that was painted, we multiply the surface area of one face by the number of faces (6):\n\nTotal surface area = 49 square cm × 6 = 294 square cm\n\nSo, the total surface area that was painted is 294 square cm."
