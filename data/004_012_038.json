    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 1) / (x + 3) using the quotient rule, we first identify the numerator function as u(x) = 2x^2 + 1 and the denominator function as v(x) = x + 3. \n\nThe quotient rule states that the derivative of a quotient of two functions is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (v(x) * u'(x) - u(x) * v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 1)/dx = 4x\nv'(x) = d(x + 3)/dx = 1\n\nNow, we apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = ((x + 3) * (4x) - (2x^2 + 1) * (1)) / (x + 3)^2\n\nf'(x) = (4x^2 + 12x - 2x^2 - 1) / (x^2 + 6x + 9)\n\nf'(x) = (2x^2 + 12x - 1) / (x^2 + 6x + 9)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 1) / (x + 3) is:\n\nf'(x) = (2x^2 + 12x - 1) / (x^2 + 6x + 9)"
