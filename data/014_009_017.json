    "message_2": "A Feistel cipher is a symmetric key block cipher that operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext and ciphertext. In this case, we have a block size of 64 bits and a 48-bit key. However, the plaintext message \"10101010\" is only 8 bits long, which is not compatible with the 64-bit block size. \n\nPlease provide a 64-bit plaintext message to proceed with the encryption process."
