    "message_1": "A study is conducted to estimate the average weight of all students at a university. A sample of 100 students is selected using systematic sampling technique. The first student is chosen randomly from the student list and every 50th student after that is chosen. The average weight of the sample is found to be 140 pounds with a standard deviation of 20 pounds. Find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of all students at the university.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of all students at the university, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = (Standard Deviation) / sqrt(Sample Size)\n\nGiven the sample mean (140 pounds), standard deviation (20 pounds), and sample size (100 students), we can calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 20 / sqrt(100) = 20 / 10 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 140 ± (1.96 * 2) = 140 ± 3.92\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of all students at the university is approximately (136.08, 143.92) pounds."
