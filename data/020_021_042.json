    "message_1": "A company is trying to schedule its workers for a week. There are 10 workers available, and they need to work for 40 hours in total. Each worker can work a maximum of 5 days, and each day requires the same number of workers. What is the optimal schedule for the company? How many workers should work each day and for how many hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal schedule, we need to distribute the 40 hours of work evenly among the 10 workers and 5 days.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of worker-hours needed: 40 hours * 10 workers = 400 worker-hours.\n\nNow, let's divide the total worker-hours by the number of days: 400 worker-hours / 5 days = 80 worker-hours per day.\n\nSince each day requires the same number of workers, we can divide the worker-hours per day by the number of workers: 80 worker-hours per day / 10 workers = 8 hours per worker per day.\n\nSo, the optimal schedule for the company is to have all 10 workers work for 8 hours each day for 5 days. This way, each worker works for a total of 40 hours, and the company's work requirement is met."
