    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal created by applying the Koch curve construction to a line segment. After each iteration, the length of the line segment increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nTo find the perimeter of the Koch island after five iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Original Length * (4/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the original length is 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter after five iterations (n=5):\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (4/3)^5\nPerimeter = 1 * (1024/243)\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 4.22 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after five iterations is approximately 4.22 units."
