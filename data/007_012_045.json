    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod p), which means that (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer n > 1 such that (n-1)! + 1 is not divisible by n. Since Wilson's theorem guarantees that this property holds for prime numbers, we can focus on composite numbers.\n\nThe smallest composite number greater than 1 is 4. Let's check if (4-1)! + 1 is divisible by 4:\n\n(3)! + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n7 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, the smallest positive integer greater than 1 for which the value of (n-1)! + 1 is not divisible by n is 4."
