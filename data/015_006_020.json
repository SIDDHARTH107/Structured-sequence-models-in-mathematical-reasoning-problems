We will use the given equations to find the values of x[i+1] and y[i+1] for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nIteration 1 (i = 0):\nx[1] = 1 - 1.4 * (0.9)^2 + 0 = 1 - 1.4 * 0.81 = 0.866\ny[1] = 0.3 * 0.9 = 0.27\n\nIteration 2 (i = 1):\nx[2] = 1 - 1.4 * (0.866)^2 + 0.27 = 1 - 1.4 * 0.749956 = 0.9546616\ny[2] = 0.3 * 0.866 = 0.2598\n\nIteration 3 (i = 2):\nx[3] = 1 - 1.4 * (0.9546616)^2 + 0.2598 = 1 - 1.4 * 0.910372 = 0.7234792\ny[3] = 0.3 * 0.9546616 = 0.28639848\n\nIteration 4 (i = 3):\nx[4] = 1 - 1.4 * (0.7234792)^2 + 0.28639848 = 1 - 1.4 * 0.523018 = 1.0629744\ny[4] = 0.3 * 0.7234792 = 0.21704376\n\nIteration 5 (i = 4):\nx[5] = 1 - 1.4 * (1.0629744)^2 + 0.21704376 = 1 - 1.4 * 1.130 = -0.578956\ny[5] = 0.3 * 1.0629744 = 0.31889232\n\nThe resulting points in the (x, y) plane are:\n(0.9, 0)\n(0.866, 0.27)\n(0.9546616, 0.2598)\n(0.7234792, 0.28639848)\n(1.0629744, 0.21704376)\n(-0.578956, 0.31889232)\n\nThe plot of these points would show a scattered pattern. The Hénon map is known for its chaotic behavior, which means that the system is highly sensitive to initial conditions and can exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior after many iterations. In this case, the plot does not show a clear pattern or convergence, indicating that the system will likely continue to exhibit chaotic behavior as the number of iterations increases."
