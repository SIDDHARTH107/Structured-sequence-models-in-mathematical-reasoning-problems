    "message_2": "To approximate the solution for u(x, t) at t = 5 seconds with a mesh size h = 10 using the finite element method, we first need to discretize the domain of the problem. Since the problem is defined on the interval [0, 100], we can create a mesh by dividing the interval into equal segments of length h = 10. This will give us the following nodes:\n\nx_i = {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}\n\nNow, we can use the finite element method to approximate the solution at each node. Since the given partial differential equation is linear, we can use linear basis functions to approximate the solution. Let's denote the basis functions as φ_i(x), where i is the index of the node. The approximate solution u_h(x, t) can be written as:\n\nu_h(x, t) = Σ c_i(t) * φ_i(x)\n\nTo find the coefficients c_i(t), we can use the Galerkin method, which requires that the residual of the equation is orthogonal to the basis functions. The residual R(x, t) is given by:\n\nR(x, t) = u(x, t) - u_h(x, t)\n\nNow, we need to enforce the orthogonality condition:\n\n∫ R(x, t) * φ_j(x) dx = 0, for all j\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R(x, t) and u_h(x, t), we get:\n\n∫ (0.1(100 - x)t - Σ c_i(t) * φ_i(x)) * φ_j(x) dx = 0, for all j\n\nWe can solve this system of equations for the coefficients c_i(t) and then substitute them back into the expression for u_h(x, t) to get the approximate solution at each node.\n\nAt t = 5 seconds, the given partial differential equation becomes:\n\nu(x, 5) = 0.1(100 - x) * 5\n\nNow, we can evaluate this expression at each node to get the approximate solution:\n\nu_h(x_i, 5) = {0, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0}\n\nSo, the approximate solution for u(x, t) at t = 5 seconds with a mesh size h = 10 using the finite element method is:\n\nu_h(x, 5) = {0, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0}"
