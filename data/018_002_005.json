Therefore, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 7, 11}\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of A. Since A ∩ B = {3, 7, 11}, we can see that all these elements are also in set A:\n\n3 ∈ A, 7 ∈ A, and 11 ∈ A\n\nSince every element of A ∩ B is also an element of A, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nA ∩ B ⊆ A\n\nNext, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of B.
