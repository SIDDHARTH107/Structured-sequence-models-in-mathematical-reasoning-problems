    "message_2": "Apologies for the confusion in my previous responses. Let's solve the problem correctly.\n\nTo find the number of smaller identical tetrahedrons required to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron at the 4th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of tetrahedrons = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we have:\n\nNumber of tetrahedrons = (4^4 - 1) / 3\nNumber of tetrahedrons = (256 - 1) / 3\nNumber of tetrahedrons = 255 / 3\nNumber of tetrahedrons = 85\n\nSo, 85 smaller identical tetrahedrons are required to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron at the 4th iteration."
