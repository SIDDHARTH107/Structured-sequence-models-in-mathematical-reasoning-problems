    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order differential equation y' = 2x with the initial condition y(0) = 1, we need to find the function y(x) that satisfies both the equation and the initial condition.\n\nFirst, we can integrate both sides of the equation with respect to x:\n\n∫(dy/dx) dx = ∫2x dx\n\nBy integrating, we get:\n\ny(x) = x^2 + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n1 = (0)^2 + C\n\nC = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = x^2 + 1"
