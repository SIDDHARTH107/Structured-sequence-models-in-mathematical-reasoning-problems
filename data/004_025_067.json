    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the vertical component of the initial velocity and then use calculus to find the maximum height and the time it takes to reach that point.\n\n1. Find the vertical component of the initial velocity:\nThe initial velocity (v0) is given as 40 m/s at an angle of 30° above the horizontal. We can find the vertical component (v0y) using the sine function:\n\nv0y = v0 * sin(30°)\nv0y = 40 * 0.5\nv0y = 20 m/s\n\n2. Set up the vertical motion equation:\nThe vertical motion of the projectile can be described by the following equation:\n\ny(t) = v0y * t - (1/2) * g * t^2\n\nwhere y(t) is the height at time t, v0y is the initial vertical velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and t is the time.\n\n3. Find the maximum height using calculus:\nTo find the maximum height, we need to find the time when the vertical velocity is zero (i.e., when the projectile is momentarily at rest). We can do this by taking the derivative of the height equation with respect to time and setting it equal to zero:\n\ny'(t) = v0y - g * t\n\nSet y'(t) = 0 and solve for t:\n\n0 = 20 - 9.81 * t\nt = 20 / 9.81\nt ≈ 2.04 s\n\nNow that we have the time it takes to reach the maximum height, we can plug this value back into the height equation to find the maximum height:\n\ny(2.04) = 20 * 2.04 - (1/2) * 9.81 * (2.04)^2\ny(2.04) ≈ 20.4 m\n\nSo, the maximum height the projectile will reach is approximately 20.4 meters, and it will take about 2.04 seconds to reach that point."
