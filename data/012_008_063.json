    "message_2": "A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn a planar graph, each face must be enclosed by at least 3 edges, and each edge is shared by two faces. Therefore, we have:\n\n3F ≤ 2E\n\nCombining this inequality with Euler's formula, we get:\n\nV - E + (2E/3) ≥ 2\n\nSolving for E, we have:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, V = 8, so:\n\nE ≤ 3 * 8 - 6 = 18\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of edges that a planar graph with 8 vertices can have is 18."
