    "message_1": "A sheet of paper is to be formed into a rectangular box with a square base by cutting out equal squares from each corner and folding up the sides. If the area of paper available is 180 cm², what dimensions will produce a box with maximum volume?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner, and let l and w be the length and width of the sheet of paper, respectively. After cutting out the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be (l - 2x), (w - 2x), and x. The volume V of the box can be expressed as:\n\nV = x(l - 2x)(w - 2x)\n\nWe are given that the area of the paper is 180 cm², so:\n\nlw = 180\n\nWe want to find the dimensions l and w that will maximize the volume V. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We will introduce a new variable λ (lambda) and form the following equation:\n\nF(x, l, w, λ) = x(l - 2x)(w - 2x) - λ(lw - 180)\n\nNow, we will find the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, l, w, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂F/∂x = (l - 2x)(w - 2x) - 2x(l - 2x) - 2x(w - 2x) = 0\n∂F/∂l = x(w - 2x) - λw = 0\n∂F/∂w = x(l - 2x) - λl = 0\n∂F/∂λ = lw - 180 = 0\n\nFrom ∂F/∂l and ∂F/∂w, we can express λ in terms of x, l, and w:\n\nλ = x(w - 2x)/w = x(l - 2x)/l\n\nBy equating the two expressions for λ, we get:\n\nx(w - 2x)/w = x(l - 2x)/l\n\nSince x ≠ 0, we can cancel out x from both sides:\n\n(w - 2x)/w = (l - 2x)/l\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\nl(w - 2x) = w(l - 2x)\n\nlw - 2lx = lw - 2wx\n\n2lx = 2wx\n\nl = w\n\nSince lw = 180, we have:\n\nl² = 180\nl = w = √180 = 6√5\n\nNow, we can substitute l = w = 6√5 back into the equation ∂F/∂x = 0:\n\n(6√5 - 2x)(6√5 - 2x) - 2x(6√5 - 2x) - 2x(6√5 - 2x) = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = √5\n\nNow we have the dimensions of the box:\n\nLength = l - 2x = 6√5 - 2√5 = 4√5\nWidth = w - 2x = 6√5 - 2√5 = 4√5\nHeight = x = √5\n\nSo, the dimensions that will produce a box with maximum volume are 4√5 cm x 4√5 cm x √5 cm."
