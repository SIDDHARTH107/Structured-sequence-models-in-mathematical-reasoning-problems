    "message_1": "Suppose a message is encrypted using a substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another letter. By conducting a frequency analysis on the encrypted message, it is found that the most frequently occurring letter is 'G', which appears 24 times. What is the most likely letter that 'G' corresponds to in the original message?",
    "message_2": "In the English language, the most frequently occurring letter is 'E'. Therefore, it is most likely that 'G' in the encrypted message corresponds to 'E' in the original message."
