    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^5 - 7x^3 + 2x - 9, we will apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\nf'(x) = d(4x^5)/dx - d(7x^3)/dx + d(2x)/dx - d(9)/dx\n\nFor the first term, 4x^5:\nn = 5, so the derivative is 5 * 4x^(5-1) = 20x^4\n\nFor the second term, -7x^3:\nn = 3, so the derivative is 3 * (-7)x^(3-1) = -21x^2\n\nFor the third term, 2x:\nn = 1, so the derivative is 1 * 2x^(1-1) = 2\n\nFor the fourth term, -9:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 20x^4 - 21x^2 + 2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^5 - 7x^3 + 2x - 9 is f'(x) = 20x^4 - 21x^2 + 2."
