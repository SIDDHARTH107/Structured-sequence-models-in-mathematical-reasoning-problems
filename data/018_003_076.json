    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ B is a superset of both set A and set B, we need to show that every element in set A and set B is also an element of A ∪ B.\n\nRecall the definition of the union of two sets: The union of sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both.\n\nNow, let's find the union of sets A and B:\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 4, 6}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, we need to show that every element in set A and set B is also an element of A ∪ B.\n\nFor set A:\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor set B:\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element in set A and set B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of both set A and set B."
