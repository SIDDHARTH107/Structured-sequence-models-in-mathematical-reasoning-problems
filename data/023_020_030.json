    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = xπ/2, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)], where the sum is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (xπ/2) dx\n\na_0 = (π/2) * [x^2/2] evaluated from -π to π = (π/2) * (π^2/2 - (-π^2/2)) = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (xπ/2) * cos(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function and cos(nx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (xπ/2) * sin(nx) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = (π/2) * sin(nx) dx. Then, du = dx and v = -(1/2n) * cos(nx).\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(uv) evaluated from -π to π - ∫[-π, π] v du]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/2n) * cos(nπ) - (-(-π/2n) * cos(-nπ)) - ∫[-π, π] (-(1/2n) * cos(nx)) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/2n) * cos(nπ) + (π/2n) * cos(nπ) - 0]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1)^n * π/2n + (-1)^{-n} * π/2n]\n\nSince a_0 = 0 and a_n = 0, the Fourier series of f(x) = xπ/2 is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[b_n * sin(nx)] = Σ[((-1)^n * π/2n + (-1)^{-n} * π/2n) * sin(nx)], where the sum is from n=1 to infinity."
