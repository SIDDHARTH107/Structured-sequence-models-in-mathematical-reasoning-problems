    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function y = 4 cos(3x - π/4), we need to identify the values of A and B in the general cosine function y = A cos(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude and the period is given by (2π)/B.\n\nIn our given function, y = 4 cos(3x - π/4), we can see that:\n\nA = 4, which means the amplitude is 4.\n\nB = 3, so the period is (2π)/3.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the function is 4 and the period is (2π)/3 radians."
