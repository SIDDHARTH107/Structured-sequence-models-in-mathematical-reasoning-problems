    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half of the side length of the cube:\n\nRadius = (Side length of cube) / 2\nRadius = 8 cm / 2\nRadius = 4 cm\n\nNow we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. Plugging in the radius:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (4 cm)^3\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 64 cm^3\nVolume = 256/3 * π cm^3\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nVolume ≈ 256/3 * 3.14 cm^3\nVolume ≈ 268.16 cm^3\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 268.2 cm³."
