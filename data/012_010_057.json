    "message_2": "To find the minimum vertex cover of the given graph, we can use the approximation algorithm based on the maximum matching. First, let's find a maximum matching in the graph.\n\n1. A-B\n2. C-D\n3. E-F\n\nNow, we have a maximum matching with 3 edges. According to the approximation algorithm, the size of the minimum vertex cover is at most twice the size of the maximum matching. In this case, it would be 2 * 3 = 6. However, we can easily see that we can cover all edges with just 3 vertices: B, D, and F.\n\nSo, the minimum size of the vertex cover of this graph is 3."
