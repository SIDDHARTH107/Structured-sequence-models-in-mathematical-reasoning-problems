    "message_1": "A basketball player has a free throw percentage of 80%. If she takes 10 free throws in a game, what is the probability that she will make exactly 8 shots?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success in a single trial\n- n is the total number of trials\n- k is the number of successful trials we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 10 (the number of free throws)\n- k = 8 (the number of successful free throws we want to find the probability for)\n- p = 0.8 (the free throw percentage)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk:\nnCk = 10! / (8!(10-8)!)\nnCk = 10! / (8!2!)\nnCk = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)(2 * 1))\nnCk = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\nnCk = 45\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula:\nP(X = 8) = (45) * (0.8^8) * (1-0.8)^(10-8)\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.8^8) * (0.2^2)\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.16777216 * 0.04\nP(X = 8) â‰ˆ 0.301989888\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player will make exactly 8 shots out of 10 free throws is approximately 30.2%."
