    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule and the product rule.\n\nThe quotient rule states that log_b(x) - log_b(y) = log_b(x/y), and the product rule states that log_b(x) + log_b(y) = log_b(xy).\n\nApplying the quotient rule to the first two terms, we get:\n\nlog(base 4)(64) - log(base 4)(8) = log(base 4)(64/8)\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction inside the logarithm:\n\nlog(base 4)(64/8) = log(base 4)(8)\n\nNext, we can apply the product rule to the remaining terms:\n\nlog(base 4)(8) + log(base 4)(2) = log(base 4)(8 * 2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the product inside the logarithm:\n\nlog(base 4)(8 * 2) = log(base 4)(16)\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the logarithm:\n\nlog(base 4)(16) = 2\n\nThis is because 4^2 = 16.\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is 2."
