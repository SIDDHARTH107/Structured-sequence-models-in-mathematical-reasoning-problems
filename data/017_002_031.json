    "message_2": "Let G be a cyclic group of order 15 generated by a, so G = ⟨a⟩ = {e, a, a^2, ..., a^14}, where e is the identity element.\n\nA subgroup H of G is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup H must divide the order of G. In this case, the possible orders of H are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nIf the order of H is 1, then H = {e}, which is the trivial subgroup. This subgroup is cyclic, but it is not an interesting example.\n\nIf the order of H is 3, then H = ⟨a^k⟩, where k is a divisor of 15 such that the order of a^k is 3. We can try k = 5, since gcd(5, 15) = 1. Then H = ⟨a^5⟩ = {e, a^5, a^10}. The order of H is 3, and H is a cyclic subgroup of G generated by a^5.\n\nIf the order of H is 5, then H = ⟨a^k⟩, where k is a divisor of 15 such that the order of a^k is 5. We can try k = 3, since gcd(3, 15) = 1. Then H = ⟨a^3⟩ = {e, a^3, a^6, a^9, a^12}. The order of H is 5, and H is a cyclic subgroup of G generated by a^3.\n\nIf the order of H is 15, then H = G, which is the whole group. This subgroup is cyclic, but it is not a proper subgroup.\n\nSo, we have two examples of cyclic subgroups of G:\n\n1. H = ⟨a^5⟩ with order 3, generated by a^5.\n2. H = ⟨a^3⟩ with order 5, generated by a^3."
