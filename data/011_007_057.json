    "message_1": "A colony of rabbits has an initial population of 5 rabbits. Each month, every rabbit pair produces a new pair of rabbits, and no rabbits die. How many rabbits will the colony have after 12 months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. In this case, the sequence represents the number of rabbit pairs each month. Since there are 5 rabbits initially, we assume that there are 2 pairs and 1 single rabbit. We will calculate the number of rabbit pairs after 12 months and then multiply by 2 to get the total number of rabbits.\n\nFibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144\n\nAfter 12 months, there will be 144 rabbit pairs. Since each pair consists of 2 rabbits, the total number of rabbits will be 144 * 2 = 288 rabbits."
