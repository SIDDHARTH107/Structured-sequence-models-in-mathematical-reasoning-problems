    "message_2": "The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on an algebraic curve $X$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_X - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nwhere $K_X$ is the canonical divisor of $X$ and $l(D)$ denotes the dimension of the space of sections of the invertible sheaf associated to $D$. In our case, we are given that $g = 3$, $\\deg(D) = 5$, and $l(D) = 2$. We want to find the value of $h^0(D) = l(D)$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the canonical divisor $K_X$. Since $X$ is a curve of genus $3$, we know that the canonical divisor has degree $2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$. Now we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$2 - l(K_X - D) = 5 + 1 - 3$\n\n$l(K_X - D) = 2 - (5 + 1 - 3) = 2 - 3 = -1$\n\nHowever, since $l(D)$ is always non-negative, we have $l(K_X - D) = 0$. Therefore, the Riemann-Roch theorem becomes:\n\n$2 - 0 = 5 + 1 - 3$\n\nAnd we have:\n\n$h^0(D) = l(D) = 2$"
