    "message_1": "Let U be a universal set and A and B be two complementary sets where A' and B' are their complements respectively. If the cardinality of set A is 15, what is the cardinality of set B'?",
    "message_2": "Since A and B are complementary sets, their union covers the entire universal set U, and they have no elements in common (their intersection is the empty set). In other words, A ∪ B = U and A ∩ B = ∅.\n\nNow, let's consider the complements of A and B, which are A' and B' respectively. According to De Morgan's Law, the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements, and the complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n(A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B' and (A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'\n\nSince A ∪ B = U, then (A ∪ B)' = U' = ∅ (the complement of the universal set is the empty set). Therefore, A' ∩ B' = ∅.\n\nNow, let's find the cardinality of set B'. Since A and B are complementary sets, the cardinality of set B can be found by subtracting the cardinality of set A from the cardinality of the universal set U:\n\n|B| = |U| - |A|\n\nWe are given that |A| = 15, but we don't have the information about the cardinality of the universal set |U|. Therefore, we cannot determine the cardinality of set B or set B' without more information about the universal set U."
