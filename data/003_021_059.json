    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors v and w, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nv · w = ||v|| ||w|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors, v · w is the dot product of the vectors, and ||v|| and ||w|| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the vectors v and w:\n\nv · w = (3)(5) + (-4)(2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors v and w:\n\n||v|| = √(3² + (-4)²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n||w|| = √(5² + 2²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (v · w) / (||v|| ||w||) = 7 / (5√29)\n\nTo find the angle θ, we can use the inverse cosine function (also known as arccos or cos^(-1)):\n\nθ = arccos(7 / (5√29))\n\nThis is the exact value of the angle between the vectors v and w. To get an approximate value, you can use a calculator:\n\nθ ≈ arccos(7 / (5√29)) ≈ 37.76°"
