Since sets A and B have no common elements, their intersection is an empty set:\n\nA ∩ B = {}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) with set B:\n\n(A ∩ B) × B = {} × {3, 4}.\n\nSince the Cartesian product of an empty set with any set is an empty set, we have:\n\n(A ∩ B) × B = {}.\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of set B with (A ∩ B):\n\nB ∩ (A ∩ B) = {3, 4} ∩ {} = {}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A with set B ∩ (A ∩ B):\n\nA × (B ∩ (A ∩ B)) = {1, 2} × {}.\n\nAgain, since the Cartesian product of any set with an empty set is an empty set, we have:\n\nA × (B ∩ (A ∩ B)) = {}.\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we find that they are equal:\n\n(A ∩ B) × B = A × (B ∩ (A ∩ B)) = {}."
