    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 players in a beauty contest game. Each player has to choose a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive). The winner of the game is the player whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all numbers chosen by the players. What number should a rational player choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the average of all numbers chosen by the players as A. The target number to win the game is (2/3)A. Since all players are rational, they will also aim for this target number.\n\nIn the first round of reasoning, if all players choose a number uniformly between 0 and 100, the average A would be 50. Therefore, a rational player would choose (2/3) * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, since all players are rational, they will also think this way and choose 33.33. In the second round of reasoning, the average A would be 33.33, and the target number would be (2/3) * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nThis process can be iterated, with each round of reasoning leading to a lower target number:\n\n1. (2/3) * 50 = 33.33\n2. (2/3) * 33.33 = 22.22\n3. (2/3) * 22.22 = 14.81\n4. (2/3) * 14.81 = 9.87\n5. (2/3) * 9.87 = 6.58\n...\n\nAs the number of rounds of reasoning increases, the target number approaches 0. In practice, the number of rounds of reasoning may be limited, and players may not be perfectly rational. However, in a game with perfectly rational players, choosing a number close to 0 would maximize the chances of winning."
