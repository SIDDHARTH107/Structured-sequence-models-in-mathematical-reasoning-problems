    "message_2": "This subspace of real numbers is not connected or path-connected. \n\nA space is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open subsets. In this case, the given subspace can be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open subsets: (-1, 0) and (0, 1). Therefore, it is not connected.\n\nA space is path-connected if there exists a continuous path between any two points in the space. In this case, there is no continuous path between any point in the interval (-1, 0) and any point in the interval (0, 1) because any such path would have to pass through the point 0, which is not in the subspace. Therefore, the subspace is not path-connected."
