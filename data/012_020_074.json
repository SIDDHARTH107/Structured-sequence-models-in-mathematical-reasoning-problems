    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms.\n\nFor the given graph G, which is a hexagon, we can consider the following transformations:\n\n1. Identity (no change): The vertices remain the same.\n2. Rotation by 60 degrees clockwise: The vertices are shifted one position to the right.\n3. Rotation by 120 degrees clockwise: The vertices are shifted two positions to the right.\n4. Rotation by 180 degrees: The vertices are shifted three positions to the right.\n5. Rotation by 240 degrees clockwise: The vertices are shifted four positions to the right.\n6. Rotation by 300 degrees clockwise: The vertices are shifted five positions to the right.\n\nThese rotations are all automorphisms of the graph, as they preserve the adjacency relation. There are no other automorphisms, as any reflection would not preserve the adjacency relation.\n\nTherefore, the automorphism group of G is a cyclic group of order 6, denoted as C6 or Z6."
