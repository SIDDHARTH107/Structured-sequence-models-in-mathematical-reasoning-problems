    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, it's a way to pair up the vertices so that each pair is connected by an edge.\n\nFor a graph with 8 vertices, we need to find the number of ways to pair up the vertices. This can be calculated using the double factorial function, which is defined as the product of all the integers from 1 to n with the same parity as n. In this case, we want to find the double factorial of 7, which is denoted as 7!!.\n\n7!! = 7 * 5 * 3 * 1 = 105\n\nSo, there are 105 perfect matchings in a graph with 8 vertices."
