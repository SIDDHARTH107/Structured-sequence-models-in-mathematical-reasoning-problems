    "message_2": "To find A x (B U {5}), we first need to find the union of sets B and {5}. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets. So, B U {5} = {3, 4, 5}.\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product A x (B U {5}). The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted by A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x (B U {5}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\n\nSo, A x (B U {5}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}."
