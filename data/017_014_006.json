    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given multiplication table to determine the properties of the group.\n\n1. The identity element is e, as the multiplication of any element with e results in the same element.\n\n2. Each element has an inverse, as we can see that for every element x, there exists an element y such that x * y = e. For example, a * a = e, b * f = e, and so on.\n\n3. The group is non-abelian, as the multiplication table shows that the operation is not commutative. For example, a * b = d, but b * a = f.\n\nNow let's compare the group with the given options:\n\n1. C20: This is the cyclic group of order 20. It is an abelian group, but our group is non-abelian. So, our group is not isomorphic to C20.\n\n2. D10: This is the dihedral group of order 20 (2 * 10). It is a non-abelian group, and it has the same order as our group. However, we need to check if the structure of the group matches. In D10, there is an element of order 10 (a rotation) and an element of order 2 (a reflection). In our group, the element a has order 2 (a * a = e), and the element b has order 10 (b^10 = e). So, our group is isomorphic to D10.\n\n3. The non-abelian group of order 20: This group is non-abelian, but it has a different structure than our group. It is not isomorphic to our group.\n\nIn conclusion, the given group is isomorphic to D10."
