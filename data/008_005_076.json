    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation. Also, multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\n2*(x + 2y - z) = 2*5\n2x + 4y - 2z = 10\n\nNow subtract the first equation multiplied by 2 from the second equation:\n(2x + 5y + 3z) - (2x + 4y - 2z) = 2 - 10\ny + 5z = -8 (1)\n\nNow subtract the first equation multiplied by 3 from the third equation:\n3*(x + 2y - z) = 3*5\n3x + 6y - 3z = 15\n\n(3x + 7y - 2z) - (3x + 6y - 3z) = 1 - 15\ny + z = -14 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, y and z:\n\ny + 5z = -8 (1)\ny + z = -14 (2)\n\nWe can eliminate y by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(1) - (2) => (y + 5z) - (y + z) = -8 - (-14)\n4z = 6\nz = 6/4\nz = 1.5\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can find the value of y using equation (2):\n\ny + 1.5 = -14\ny = -14 - 1.5\ny = -15.5\n\nFinally, we can find the value of x using the first equation:\n\nx + 2(-15.5) - 1.5 = 5\nx - 31 = 5\nx = 5 + 31\nx = 36\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 36, y = -15.5, and z = 1.5."
