    "message_2": "To find the signal in the time domain, we need to compute the inverse Fourier transform of F(w). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[F(w) * e^(jwt)] dw\n\nwhere f(t) is the signal in the time domain, F(w) is the Fourier transform, and the integral is taken over the entire frequency domain.\n\nGiven F(w) = 10/(4+4jw), we have:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[(10/(4+4jw)) * e^(jwt)] dw\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the method of complex contour integration. We can rewrite F(w) as:\n\nF(w) = 10 * (1/(4+4jw))\n\nNow, we can see that F(w) has a simple pole at w = -j. We can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral:\n\nResidue = lim(w→-j) [(w + j) * F(w)]\n\nResidue = lim(w→-j) [(w + j) * (10 * (1/(4+4jw)))]\n\nResidue = 10 * lim(w→-j) [(w + j)/(4+4jw)]\n\nResidue = 10 * (1/8) = 5/4\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) * 2π * Residue * e^(-jt) (since the pole is at w = -j)\n\nf(t) = (5/4) * e^(t)\n\nSo, the signal in the time domain is:\n\nf(t) = (5/4) * e^(t)"
