    "message_1": "A company produces a product at a cost of $50 per unit. The demand equation for the product is given by Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price of the product. What is the optimal price that maximizes the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to find the price that maximizes the revenue and then subtract the cost of production. \n\nFirst, let's find the revenue function. Revenue (R) is the product of the price (P) and the quantity demanded (Q).\n\nR(P) = P * Q\n\nSince Q = 100 - 2P, we can substitute this into the revenue function:\n\nR(P) = P * (100 - 2P)\n\nNow, let's find the profit function. Profit (π) is the revenue minus the cost of production. The cost of production is $50 per unit, so the total cost is 50Q.\n\nπ(P) = R(P) - 50Q\n\nSubstitute the revenue function and the demand equation:\n\nπ(P) = P * (100 - 2P) - 50(100 - 2P)\n\nNow, let's find the price that maximizes the profit. To do this, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative with respect to P and setting it equal to 0.\n\ndπ/dP = d(P * (100 - 2P) - 50(100 - 2P))/dP\n\nUsing the product rule and the chain rule, we get:\n\ndπ/dP = (100 - 2P) - 2P(1) - 100(0) + 50(2)\n\nSimplify:\n\ndπ/dP = 100 - 4P\n\nNow, set the first derivative equal to 0 and solve for P:\n\n0 = 100 - 4P\n4P = 100\nP = 25\n\nThe optimal price that maximizes the company's profit is $25 per unit."
