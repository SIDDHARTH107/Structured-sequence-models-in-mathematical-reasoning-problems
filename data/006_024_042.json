    "message_2": "There are a total of 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling a pair of dice. To find the probability of getting a sum of 7 on the first roll, we need to determine the number of outcomes that result in a sum of 7.\n\nHere are the combinations that result in a sum of 7:\n(1, 6)\n(2, 5)\n(3, 4)\n(4, 3)\n(5, 2)\n(6, 1)\n\nThere are 6 combinations that result in a sum of 7. So, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 on the first roll is:\n\n6 (favorable outcomes) / 36 (total possible outcomes) = 1/6 or approximately 0.1667 or 16.67%."
