    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z) = (z+2)/(z^2 - 1), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz + 2 = 0\nz = -2\n\nSo, there is one zero at z = -2.\n\nTo find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two poles at z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to classify the zeros and poles. Since the zero at z = -2 is not a common factor with the denominator, it is a removable zero.\n\nFor the poles, we need to check the order of the poles. The denominator has a simple linear factor (z - 1) and (z + 1), which means both poles are of order 1.\n\nIn summary:\n- Zero at z = -2 is removable.\n- Pole at z = 1 is of order 1.\n- Pole at z = -1 is of order 1."
