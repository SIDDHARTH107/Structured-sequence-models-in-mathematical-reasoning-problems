    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using the elimination method, we first need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. In this case, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\nFirst equation: \\(4x + 3y = 18\\)\n\nSecond equation (multiplied by 2): \\(4x - 10y = -28\\)\n\nNow, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x:\n\n\\((4x + 3y) - (4x - 10y) = 18 - (-28)\\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\(13y = 46\\)\n\nNow, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 13:\n\n\\(y = \\frac{46}{13}\\)\n\n\\(y = 3.54\\)\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n\\(4x + 3(3.54) = 18\\)\n\n\\(4x + 10.62 = 18\\)\n\nNow, subtract 10.62 from both sides:\n\n\\(4x = 7.38\\)\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{7.38}{4}\\)\n\n\\(x = 1.845\\)\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n\\(x = 1.845\\) and \\(y = 3.54\\)"
