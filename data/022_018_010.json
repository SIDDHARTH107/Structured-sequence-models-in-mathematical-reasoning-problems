    "message_2": "To solve the given complex partial differential equation, we first rewrite it in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let $u(z, \\bar{z}) = v(z, \\bar{z}) + i w(z, \\bar{z})$, where $v$ and $w$ are real-valued functions. Then, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z\\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z\\partial \\bar{z}} + i\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial z\\partial \\bar{z}}$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + i\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the given equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z\\partial \\bar{z}} + i\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial z\\partial \\bar{z}} + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + i\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}\\right) = 0$$\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain two real partial differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z\\partial \\bar{z}} + 4\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial z\\partial \\bar{z}} + 4\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$$\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation for $v(z, \\bar{z})$. We can rewrite it as:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + 4v\\right) = 0$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to $\\bar{z}$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + 4v = f(z)$$\n\nwhere $f(z)$ is an arbitrary function of $z$. Now, we can solve this first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $v(z, \\bar{z})$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} = -4v + f(z)$$\n\nUsing an integrating factor, $e^{4z}$, we multiply both sides of the equation:\n\n$$e^{4z}\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} = -4ve^{4z} + f(z)e^{4z}$$\n\nNow, the left-hand side is the derivative of $ve^{4z}$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(ve^{4z}) = -4ve^{4z} + f(z)e^{4z}$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to $z$, we obtain:\n\n$$ve^{4z} = -\\int f(z)e^{4z}dz + g(\\bar{z})$$\n\nwhere $g(\\bar{z})$ is an arbitrary function of $\\bar{z}$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$v(z, \\bar{z}) = e^{-4z}\\left(-\\int f(z)e^{4z}dz + g(\\bar{z})\\right)$$\n\nSimilarly, we can solve the second equation for $w(z, \\bar{z})$:\n\n$$w(z, \\bar{z}) = e^{-4z}\\left(-\\int h(z)e^{4z}dz + k(\\bar{z})\\right)$$\n\nwhere $h(z)$ is an arbitrary function of $z$ and $k(\\bar{z})$ is an arbitrary function of $\\bar{z}$.\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for $u(z, \\bar{z})$:\n\n$$u(z, \\bar{z}) = e^{-4z}\\left(-\\int f(z)e^{4z}dz + g(\\bar{z})\\right) + ie^{-4z}\\left(-\\int h(z)e^{4z}dz + k(\\bar{z})\\right)$$\n\nTo satisfy the given boundary conditions, we have:\n\n$$u(0, \\bar{z}) = e^{i\\theta} \\Rightarrow v(0, \\bar{z}) = \\cos(\\theta), w(0, \\bar{z}) = \\sin(\\theta)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}(0, \\bar{z}) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}(0, \\bar{z}) = 0, \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}(0, \\bar{z}) = 0$$\n\nThese conditions determine the functions $f(z)$, $g(\\bar{z})$, $h(z)$, and $k(\\bar{z})$. However, without more information, we cannot uniquely determine these functions. Thus, the general solution for $u(z, \\bar{z})$ with the given boundary conditions is:\n\n$$u(z, \\bar{z}) = e^{-4z}\\left(-\\int f(z)e^{4z}dz + g(\\bar{z})\\right) + ie^{-4z}\\left(-\\int h(z)e^{4z}dz + k(\\bar{z})\\right)$$\n\nwhere $f(z)$, $g(\\bar{z})$, $h(z)$, and $k(\\bar{z})$ are determined by the boundary conditions."
