    "message_1": "A company wants to test four factors (speed, temperature, pressure, and time) that can affect the quality of their product. They decide to use an orthogonal array with 16 runs to conduct their experiments. How many levels does each factor need to have in order to use an orthogonal array with 16 runs?",
    "message_2": "To use an orthogonal array with 16 runs for testing four factors, each factor needs to have 2 levels. This is because 2^4 = 16, which means that there are 16 possible combinations of the four factors when each factor has two levels. This allows for a complete orthogonal array with 16 runs to be conducted."
