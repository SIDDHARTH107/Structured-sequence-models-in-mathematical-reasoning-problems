    "message_1": "A Playfair cipher has been encrypted with the keyword \"MATH\". The message is \"WSEBMLTHKHAJ\". Decrypt the message and find the original plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Playfair cipher, we first need to create a 5x5 grid using the keyword \"MATH\" and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, as it is combined with I in the Playfair cipher).\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the keyword: MATH\n2. Create the 5x5 grid:\n\n   M  A  T  H  B\n   C  D  E  F  G\n   I/K L  N  O  P\n   Q  R  S  U  V\n   W  X  Y  Z\n\n3. Now, we will decrypt the message \"WSEBMLTHKHAJ\" by dividing it into digraphs and applying the Playfair decryption rules:\n\n   WS  EB  ML  TH  KH  AJ\n\n   - WS: W and S are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left (wrap around if needed). W -> V, S -> R. Decrypted digraph: VR\n   - EB: E and B are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left (wrap around if needed). E -> D, B -> H. Decrypted digraph: DH\n   - ML: M and L are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle with them and replace them with the letters in the same row but on the other corner. M -> A, L -> I. Decrypted digraph: AI\n   - TH: T and H are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their left (wrap around if needed). T -> S, H -> B. Decrypted digraph: SB\n   - KH: K (combined with I) and H are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle with them and replace them with the letters in the same row but on the other corner. K -> L, H -> G. Decrypted digraph: LG\n   - AJ: A and J (combined with I) are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle with them and replace them with the letters in the same row but on the other corner. A -> M, J -> T. Decrypted digraph: MT\n\n4. Combine the decrypted digraphs to get the original plaintext message: VRDHAI SBLGMT\n\nPlease note that the plaintext message might not make sense, as the Playfair cipher is a simple substitution cipher and can be easily broken with modern techniques. The decrypted message might also need further deciphering or interpretation."
