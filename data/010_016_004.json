    "message_1": "Consider a closed orientable surface of genus 2, such as a double torus. Use Poincaré duality to compute the intersection number of two homology classes represented by non-intersecting closed oriented curves on the surface. \n\nFor example, let one homology class be represented by a curve that goes around one of the holes of the double torus and the other homology class be represented by a curve that goes around the other hole. Find their intersection number using Poincaré duality.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the two homology classes by [A] and [B], where [A] is represented by a curve going around one hole of the double torus and [B] is represented by a curve going around the other hole. Since the double torus is a closed orientable surface of genus 2, its homology groups are given by:\n\nH_0 = H_2 = Z\nH_1 = Z^4\n\nNow, let's use Poincaré duality. Poincaré duality states that for a closed orientable surface of genus g, there is an isomorphism between the homology groups H_k and H_{2-k}. In our case, this means that there is an isomorphism between H_1 and H_1, which is the identity map.\n\nUnder this isomorphism, the homology classes [A] and [B] are mapped to cohomology classes [A]^* and [B]^* in H^1. To compute the intersection number of [A] and [B], we need to evaluate the cup product of their dual cohomology classes:\n\n[A]^* ∪ [B]^* ∈ H^2\n\nSince H^2 is isomorphic to Z, the cup product will give us an integer value, which is the intersection number we are looking for.\n\nNow, let's consider the basis of H_1. We can choose a basis {a1, a2, b1, b2} such that a1 and a2 are curves going around the two holes of the double torus, and b1 and b2 are curves going around the two \"handles\" connecting the holes. In this basis, we can represent [A] = a1 and [B] = a2.\n\nThe cup product can be computed using the intersection form, which is a 4x4 matrix Q with entries Q_ij = a_i ∪ b_j. For a closed orientable surface of genus 2, the intersection form is given by:\n\nQ = | 0  1  0  0 |\n    | 1  0  0  0 |\n    | 0  0  0  1 |\n    | 0  0  1  0 |\n\nNow, we can compute the cup product [A]^* ∪ [B]^* by evaluating the matrix product:\n\n[A]^* ∪ [B]^* = (1, 0, 0, 0) Q (0, 1, 0, 0)^T = 0\n\nThus, the intersection number of the two homology classes [A] and [B] represented by non-intersecting closed oriented curves on the double torus is 0."
