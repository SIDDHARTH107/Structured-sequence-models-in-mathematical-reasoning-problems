    "message_1": "Suppose a population has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we take a random sample of 100 individuals from this population, what is the probability that the sample mean is between 48 and 52?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the population mean (μ) is 50 and the population standard deviation (σ) is 10, we can find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean) using the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nwhere n is the sample size (100 in this case).\n\nσ_sample_mean = 10 / √100 = 10 / 10 = 1\n\nNow, we have a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 1. We want to find the probability that the sample mean is between 48 and 52. To do this, we will use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor the lower bound (48):\n\nz_lower = (48 - 50) / 1 = -2\n\nFor the upper bound (52):\n\nz_upper = (52 - 50) / 1 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is between -2 and 2. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) ≈ 0.9544\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample mean is between 48 and 52 is approximately 95.44%."
