    "message_2": "There are five distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 40. These groups are:\n\n1. The cyclic group C40.\n2. The dihedral group D20.\n3. The direct product of C8 and C5, denoted as C8 × C5.\n4. The direct product of C4 and C10, denoted as C4 × C10.\n5. The semi-direct product of C5 and Q8, denoted as Q8 ⋊ C5.\n\nNow, let's prove that every group of order 40 is isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 40. Since 40 = 2^3 × 5, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P and a Sylow 2-subgroup Q in G. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups is congruent to 1 mod 5 and divides 8, so there can be either 1 or 8 Sylow 5-subgroups. If there is only 1 Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups is congruent to 1 mod 2 and divides 5, so there can be either 1 or 5 Sylow 2-subgroups. If there is only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal in G.\n\nCase 1: Both P and Q are normal in G.\nIn this case, G is the direct product of P and Q, so G is isomorphic to either C8 × C5 or C4 × C10.\n\nCase 2: P is normal in G, but Q is not.\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of Q and P. Since P is cyclic of order 5, there is only one possible action of Q on P, which is trivial. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is either C8 × C5 or C4 × C10.\n\nCase 3: Q is normal in G, but P is not.\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of P and Q. If Q is isomorphic to C8, then there is only one possible action of P on Q, which is trivial. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C8 × C5. If Q is isomorphic to Q8, then there are two possible actions of P on Q: one is trivial, and the other is non-trivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to Q8 × C5. If the action is non-trivial, G is isomorphic to Q8 ⋊ C5.\n\nCase 4: Neither P nor Q is normal in G.\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of P and Q. Since P is cyclic of order 5 and Q is isomorphic to Q8, there are two possible actions of P on Q: one is trivial, and the other is non-trivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to Q8 × C5. If the action is non-trivial, G is isomorphic to Q8 ⋊ C5.\n\nIn all cases, G is isomorphic to one of the five groups listed above: C40, D20, C8 × C5, C4 × C10, or Q8 ⋊ C5."
