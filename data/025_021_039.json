    "message_1": "Suppose an algebraic curve in the complex plane is described by the equation: \n\ny^2 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x \n\nUsing the mirror symmetry, compute the number of rational points on the mirror image of this curve which is given by the equation: \n\nx^2 = y^3 + 4y^2 - 3y \n\nNote: The definition of mirror symmetry involves transforming a given mathematical object into its mirror image and studying the relationships between the two objects. In algebraic geometry, it is often used to study symmetries between two different algebraic varieties or surfaces.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of rational points on the mirror image of the curve, we first need to understand the relationship between the original curve and its mirror image. The mirror symmetry transformation swaps the roles of x and y in the equation:\n\nOriginal curve: y^2 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x\nMirror image: x^2 = y^3 + 4y^2 - 3y\n\nNow, we want to find the number of rational points on the mirror image curve. A rational point is a point on the curve where both x and y are rational numbers (fractions of integers). \n\nTo find the rational points, we can use the method of elliptic curves. The given curve is an elliptic curve, and we can find its rational points by finding its group structure. The group structure of an elliptic curve is determined by its rank and torsion subgroup.\n\nFor the given curve, we can use a computer algebra system like SageMath or Magma to compute the rank and torsion subgroup. However, without the use of a computer algebra system, it is difficult to compute the rank and torsion subgroup of the curve.\n\nAssuming we have access to a computer algebra system, we can compute the rank and torsion subgroup of the mirror image curve. The number of rational points on the curve will be infinite if the rank is positive, and it will be equal to the size of the torsion subgroup if the rank is zero.\n\nIn conclusion, without the use of a computer algebra system, it is difficult to compute the number of rational points on the mirror image curve. However, with the help of a computer algebra system, we can compute the rank and torsion subgroup of the curve, which will give us information about the number of rational points on the curve."
