    "message_2": "To use the Jacobi iterative method, we first rewrite the given system of linear equations in the form of x = f(x, y, z), y = g(x, y, z), and z = h(x, y, z):\n\nx = (8 - y + z) / 2\ny = (11 + x - 2z) / 3\nz = (5 - 3x + 2y) / 5\n\nNow, we use the initial approximation (x0, y0, z0) = (1, 1, 1) to find the first approximate solution (x1, y1, z1):\n\nx1 = (8 - 1 + 1) / 2 = 4\ny1 = (11 + 1 - 2) / 3 = 10 / 3 ≈ 3.333\nz1 = (5 - 3 + 2) / 5 = 4 / 5 = 0.8\n\nSo, the first approximate solution is (x1, y1, z1) ≈ (4, 3.333, 0.8).\n\nNext, we use the first approximate solution to find the second approximate solution (x2, y2, z2):\n\nx2 = (8 - 3.333 + 0.8) / 2 ≈ 2.733\ny2 = (11 + 4 - 2 * 0.8) / 3 ≈ 3.733\nz2 = (5 - 3 * 4 + 2 * 3.333) / 5 ≈ -0.733\n\nSo, the second approximate solution is (x2, y2, z2) ≈ (2.733, 3.733, -0.733)."
