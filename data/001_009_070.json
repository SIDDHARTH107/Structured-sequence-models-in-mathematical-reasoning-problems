    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable and exponent. In this case, we have three types of terms: x² terms, x terms, and constant terms.\n\nx² terms: 4x² - 3x² + 9x²\nx terms: -6x - 5x\nconstant terms: 8\n\nNow, we combine the like terms:\n\nx² terms: 4x² - 3x² + 9x² = (4 - 3 + 9)x² = 10x²\nx terms: -6x - 5x = (-6 - 5)x = -11x\nconstant terms: 8\n\nFinally, we put the simplified terms together:\n\n10x² - 11x + 8"
