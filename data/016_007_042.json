    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, smaller cubes are removed from the remaining larger cubes, following a specific pattern. After the nth iteration, the volume of the Menger sponge can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = a^3 * (20/27)^n\n\nwhere a is the edge length of the initial cube (in this case, 1 unit) and n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 1^3 * (20/27)^4\nVolume = (20/27)^4\nVolume â‰ˆ 0.1602 cubic units\n\nSo, the volume of the Menger sponge after the 4th iteration is approximately 0.1602 cubic units."
