    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 8 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the area of the triangle in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 cm × 10 cm) / 2\nArea = (80 cm²) / 2\nArea = 40 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 40 square centimeters."
