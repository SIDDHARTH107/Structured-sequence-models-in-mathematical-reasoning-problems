    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall with its foot 6 feet away from the base of the wall. The ladder makes a 60-degree angle with the wall. How long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the adjacent side (the side touching the angle) divided by the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle).\n\nIn this case, the adjacent side is the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall, which is 6 feet. The angle is 60 degrees, and we want to find the length of the ladder, which is the hypotenuse.\n\nUsing the cosine function, we have:\n\ncos(60) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(60) = 6 / hypotenuse\n\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = 6 / hypotenuse\n\nNow, we can solve for the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder):\n\nhypotenuse = 6 / 0.5\nhypotenuse = 12\n\nThe length of the ladder is 12 feet."
