    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question on elliptic curve cryptography for you to solve:\n\nConsider the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 8 over the finite field F_17. Let G = (3, 5) be a generator of the group of points on E. Suppose Alice and Bob want to securely exchange a message using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Alice chooses a random integer a = 4 and computes A = aG, while Bob chooses a random integer b = 3 and computes B = bG. If Alice and Bob use the shared secret S = aB = bA to encrypt and decrypt their messages, what is the value of S?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to compute A = aG and B = bG.\n\nFor A = aG = 4G, we perform the following operations:\n1. 2G = G + G = (3, 5) + (3, 5)\n2. 4G = 2G + 2G\n\nFor B = bG = 3G, we perform the following operations:\n1. 2G = G + G = (3, 5) + (3, 5)\n2. 3G = 2G + G = 2G + (3, 5)\n\nTo compute the point addition, we use the following formulas for elliptic curves over finite fields:\n- For distinct points P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2):\n  - x3 = ((y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1))^2 - x1 - x2 (mod p)\n  - y3 = ((y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1)) * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p)\n- For point doubling P = Q = (x1, y1):\n  - x3 = ((3 * x1^2 + a) * (2 * y1)^(-1))^2 - 2 * x1 (mod p)\n  - y3 = ((3 * x1^2 + a) * (2 * y1)^(-1)) * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p)\n\nUsing these formulas, we can compute the following:\n1. 2G = (3, 5) + (3, 5) = (10, 6)\n2. 4G = 2G + 2G = (10, 6) + (10, 6) = (6, 3)\n3. 3G = 2G + G = (10, 6) + (3, 5) = (13, 10)\n\nNow, we have A = 4G = (6, 3) and B = 3G = (13, 10).\n\nNext, we compute the shared secret S = aB = bA:\n1. aB = 4(13, 10) = 4G = (6, 3)\n2. bA = 3(6, 3) = 3G = (13, 10)\n\nSince aB = bA, the shared secret S is equal to either of these points. Thus, the value of S is (6, 3)."
