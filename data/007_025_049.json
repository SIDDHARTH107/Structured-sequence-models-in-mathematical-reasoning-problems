    "message_1": "Suppose that Alice and Bob want to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a secret key. Alice chooses a prime number p = 17 and a primitive root g = 3. Alice's secret number is a = 5 and Bob's secret number is b = 7. Using the rules of the Diffie-Hellman protocol, find the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for encryption.",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman protocol, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B.\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n6. If the protocol is successful, K_A and K_B should be equal, and this value is the shared secret key.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. Alice computes A:\nA = 3^5 mod 17\nA = 243 mod 17\nA = 9\n\n2. Bob computes B:\nB = 3^7 mod 17\nB = 2187 mod 17\nB = 2\n\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B.\n\n4. Alice computes K_A:\nK_A = B^a mod p\nK_A = 2^5 mod 17\nK_A = 32 mod 17\nK_A = 15\n\n5. Bob computes K_B:\nK_B = A^b mod p\nK_B = 9^7 mod 17\nK_B = 4782969 mod 17\nK_B = 15\n\n6. Since K_A and K_B are equal, the shared secret key is 15."
