    "message_2": "To determine the manifold M up to homeomorphism, we will use the information given about its Euler characteristic and fundamental group.\n\n1. Euler characteristic: The Euler characteristic χ(M) of a closed 2-dimensional manifold M is given by χ(M) = V - E + F, where V, E, and F are the number of vertices, edges, and faces, respectively. We are given that χ(M) = 2.\n\n2. Fundamental group: The fundamental group π_1(M) of a manifold M is a topological invariant that captures information about the \"holes\" in the manifold. We are given that π_1(M) is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_8, which is the group of symmetries of a regular octagon.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible closed 2-dimensional manifolds and their properties:\n\n- Sphere (S^2): The Euler characteristic of a sphere is χ(S^2) = 2, and its fundamental group is trivial (π_1(S^2) = {e}). This does not match the given fundamental group, so M is not a sphere.\n\n- Torus (T^2): The Euler characteristic of a torus is χ(T^2) = 0, and its fundamental group is π_1(T^2) = Z × Z, where Z is the group of integers. This does not match the given Euler characteristic or fundamental group, so M is not a torus.\n\n- Klein bottle (K): The Euler characteristic of a Klein bottle is χ(K) = 0, and its fundamental group is π_1(K) = Z × Z_2, where Z_2 is the group of integers modulo 2. This does not match the given Euler characteristic or fundamental group, so M is not a Klein bottle.\n\n- Real projective plane (RP^2): The Euler characteristic of the real projective plane is χ(RP^2) = 1, and its fundamental group is π_1(RP^2) = Z_2. This does not match the given Euler characteristic or fundamental group, so M is not a real projective plane.\n\nSince M is a closed 2-dimensional manifold, it must be a connected sum of some of the above manifolds. The only possibility left is that M is a connected sum of two real projective planes, denoted as M = RP^2 # RP^2. This is because the connected sum of two real projective planes has the same Euler characteristic as M (χ(M) = 2) and the same fundamental group as M (π_1(M) = D_8).\n\nTherefore, the manifold M is up to homeomorphism the connected sum of two real projective planes, M = RP^2 # RP^2."
