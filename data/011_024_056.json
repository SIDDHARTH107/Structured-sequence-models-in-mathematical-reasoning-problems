    "message_1": "A water company has pipes of 3 different capacities: 1000 liters per hour, 2000 liters per hour, and 3000 liters per hour. The company needs to transport water from a source to a reservoir. The maximum capacity of the source is 5000 liters per hour and the maximum capacity of the reservoir is 8000 liters per hour. Determine the maximum amount of water that can be transported per hour from the source to the reservoir.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amount of water that can be transported per hour from the source to the reservoir, we need to consider the capacities of the pipes and the source and reservoir limits.\n\nThe total capacity of the three pipes is:\n1000 L/h + 2000 L/h + 3000 L/h = 6000 L/h\n\nHowever, the source has a maximum capacity of 5000 L/h, which means that the maximum amount of water that can be transported from the source is limited to 5000 L/h.\n\nOn the other hand, the reservoir has a maximum capacity of 8000 L/h, which is more than the total capacity of the pipes. Therefore, the reservoir's capacity will not be a limiting factor in this case.\n\nConsidering the capacities of the pipes and the source, the maximum amount of water that can be transported per hour from the source to the reservoir is 5000 L/h."
