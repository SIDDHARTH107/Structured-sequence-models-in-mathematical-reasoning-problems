    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the variety $V$, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining polynomial with respect to $x$ and $y$, and then find the points where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet $f(x, y) = x^3 + 3xy^2 - 3x^2 - 2y^2 + 2$. Then the partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 6xy - 4y$\n\nNow we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n(1) $3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6x = 0$\n\n(2) $6xy - 4y = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we have $y(6x - 4) = 0$. Thus, either $y = 0$ or $6x - 4 = 0$. Let's consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: $y = 0$\n\nSubstituting $y = 0$ into equation (1), we get:\n\n$3x^2 - 6x = 0 \\Rightarrow x(3x - 6) = 0$\n\nSo, either $x = 0$ or $x = 2$. Thus, we have two potential singular points in this case: $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 0)$.\n\nCase 2: $6x - 4 = 0$\n\nFrom this, we get $x = \\frac{2}{3}$. Substituting this value into equation (1), we get:\n\n$3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 + 3y^2 - 6\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$2 + 3y^2 - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow 3y^2 = 2 \\Rightarrow y^2 = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nSo, $y = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$. Thus, we have two potential singular points in this case: $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)$.\n\nNow we have found four potential singular points: $(0, 0)$, $(2, 0)$, $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)$, and $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)$. To show that these are the only singular points, we need to show that there are no other solutions to the system of equations (1) and (2).\n\nSuppose there is another solution $(x', y')$ to the system. Then, from equation (2), we must have either $y' = 0$ or $6x' - 4 = 0$. But we have already considered both of these cases and found all possible solutions. Therefore, there are no other singular points.\n\nIn conclusion, the variety $V$ has exactly four singular points: $(0, 0)$, $(2, 0)$, $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)$, and $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)$."
