    "message_2": "To minimize the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the zeros of the derivative. Newton's method is an iterative process that uses the formula:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nFirst, we need the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5) = 12x - 18\n\nNow, we will choose an initial guess for x, say x_0 = 1 (you can choose any value, but this is a reasonable starting point). Then, we will iterate using Newton's method until the value of x converges to the desired accuracy (three decimal places in this case).\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0) = 1 - (6 - 18 + 12) / (12 - 18) = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1) = 3 - (54 - 162 + 12) / (36 - 18) = 3 - 60 / 18 = 3 - 10/3 = 1/3\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 = x_2 - f'(x_2) / f''(x_2) = 1/3 - (2 - 6 + 12) / (4 - 18) = 1/3 + 8/14 = 1/3 + 4/7 ≈ 1.095\n\nIteration 4:\nx_4 = x_3 - f'(x_3) / f''(x_3) ≈ 1.095 - (6(1.095)^2 - 18(1.095) + 12) / (12(1.095) - 18) ≈ 1.095 - 0.095 = 1\n\nSince x_4 is the same as x_0 to three decimal places, we can stop iterating. The optimal value of x that minimizes the function is approximately x = 1.000."
