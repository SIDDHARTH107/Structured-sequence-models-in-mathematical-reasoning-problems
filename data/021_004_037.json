    "message_2": "To approximate the first derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 1 at x = 2 using the forward difference method with a step size of h = 0.1, we will use the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nFirst, let's find f(x) and f(x + h):\n\nf(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 1\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - (2)^2 + 3(2) - 1\nf(2) = 2(8) - 4 + 6 - 1\nf(2) = 16 - 4 + 6 - 1\nf(2) = 17\n\nNow, let's find f(x + h):\n\nf(x + h) = f(2 + 0.1) = 2(2.1)^3 - (2.1)^2 + 3(2.1) - 1\nf(2.1) = 2(9.261) - 4.41 + 6.3 - 1\nf(2.1) = 18.522 - 4.41 + 6.3 - 1\nf(2.1) = 19.412\n\nNow, we can use the forward difference formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2.1) - f(2)) / 0.1\nf'(2) ≈ (19.412 - 17) / 0.1\nf'(2) ≈ 2.412 / 0.1\nf'(2) ≈ 24.12\n\nSo, the approximate first derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 1 at x = 2 using the forward difference method with a step size of h = 0.1 is 24.12."
