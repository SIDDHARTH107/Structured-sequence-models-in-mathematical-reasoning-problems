    "message_2": "To find the value of capacitance (C1) required in a Chua circuit to exhibit chaos, we can use the following formula:\n\nC1 = L / (R1 * R2 * f^2)\n\nWhere:\nL = inductor value (18 mH)\nR1 = resistance value 1 (220 ohm)\nR2 = resistance value 2 (470 ohm)\nf = frequency (500 kHz)\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to their base units:\nL = 18 * 10^-3 H\nR1 = 220 ohm\nR2 = 470 ohm\nf = 500 * 10^3 Hz\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\nC1 = (18 * 10^-3) / (220 * 470 * (500 * 10^3)^2)\n\nC1 = (18 * 10^-3) / (220 * 470 * 2.5 * 10^11)\n\nC1 = (18 * 10^-3) / (2.583 * 10^14)\n\nC1 â‰ˆ 6.97 * 10^-18 F\n\nTherefore, the value of capacitance (C1) required in a Chua circuit to exhibit chaos at a frequency of 500 kHz with the given inductor and resistance values is approximately 6.97 * 10^-18 F."
