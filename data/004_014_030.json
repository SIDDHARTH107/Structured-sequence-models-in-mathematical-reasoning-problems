    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by the x-axis and the curve y = cos(x) from x = 0 to x = pi/2 about the y-axis, we will use the disk method.\n\nThe disk method involves integrating the area of each infinitesimally small disk along the axis of revolution. In this case, the axis of revolution is the y-axis. \n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y. Since y = cos(x), we have x = arccos(y). The radius of each disk is x, so the area of each disk is A(y) = πx^2 = π(arccos(y))^2.\n\nNow, we need to find the limits of integration for y. When x = 0, y = cos(0) = 1. When x = pi/2, y = cos(pi/2) = 0. So, we will integrate A(y) from y = 1 to y = 0.\n\nThe volume V of the solid is given by the integral:\n\nV = ∫[A(y) dy] from y = 1 to y = 0\nV = ∫[π(arccos(y))^2 dy] from y = 1 to y = 0\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we will use substitution. Let u = arccos(y), so y = cos(u). Then, dy = -sin(u) du.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nV = ∫[πu^2 (-sin(u)) du] from u = 0 to u = pi/2\n\nV = -π ∫[u^2 sin(u) du] from u = 0 to u = pi/2\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let v = u^2 and dw = sin(u) du. Then, dv = 2u du and w = -cos(u).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫v dw = vw - ∫w dv\n\nV = -π [(u^2)(-cos(u)) - ∫(-cos(u))(2u) du] from u = 0 to u = pi/2\n\nV = π [(u^2 cos(u) + 2 ∫u cos(u) du)] from u = 0 to u = pi/2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral ∫u cos(u) du. We will again use integration by parts. Let p = u and dq = cos(u) du. Then, dp = du and q = sin(u).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫p dq = pq - ∫q dp\n\n∫u cos(u) du = u sin(u) - ∫sin(u) du\n\n∫u cos(u) du = u sin(u) + cos(u)\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the volume formula:\n\nV = π [(u^2 cos(u) + 2(u sin(u) + cos(u)))] from u = 0 to u = pi/2\n\nEvaluate the expression at the limits:\n\nV = π [(0 + 2(0 + 1)) - (pi^2/4 + 2(pi/2 * 0 + 1))]\n\nV = π [(0 + 2) - (pi^2/4 + 2)]\n\nV = π [-pi^2/4]\n\nSo, the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by the x-axis and the curve y = cos(x) from x = 0 to x = pi/2 about the y-axis is -π(pi^2/4) cubic units."
