Find the Fourier series coefficient  𝑐𝑛  for the following function: \n\n  𝑓(𝑡) = 3sin(2𝑡) + 2cos(3𝑡) \n\nwhere  𝑛  is an integer, and the Fourier series of  𝑓(𝑡)  is given by:\n\n  𝑓(𝑡) = 𝑐₀ + ∑(𝑛=1)^∞ (𝑐𝑛⋅cos(n𝑡) + 𝑠𝑛⋅sin(n𝑡))\n\nCalculate  𝑐𝑛  for the function  𝑓(𝑡) .",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series coefficients, we need to calculate the coefficients 𝑐₀, 𝑐𝑛, and 𝑠𝑛. We can see that the given function 𝑓(𝑡) is already in the form of a Fourier series:\n\n𝑓(𝑡) = 3sin(2𝑡) + 2cos(3𝑡)\n\nComparing this with the general Fourier series formula, we can directly read off the coefficients:\n\n𝑐₀ = 0 (since there is no constant term)\n\nFor 𝑛 = 1, there are no terms with cos(𝑡) or sin(𝑡), so 𝑐₁ = 𝑠₁ = 0.\n\nFor 𝑛 = 2, we have a term with sin(2𝑡), so 𝑠₂ = 3, but there is no term with cos(2𝑡), so 𝑐₂ = 0.\n\nFor 𝑛 = 3, we have a term with cos(3𝑡), so 𝑐₃ = 2, but there is no term with sin(3𝑡), so 𝑠₃ = 0.\n\nFor 𝑛 > 3, there are no terms with cos(n𝑡) or sin(n𝑡), so 𝑐𝑛 = 𝑠𝑛 = 0 for 𝑛 > 3.\n\nThus, the Fourier series coefficients for the given function 𝑓(𝑡) are:\n\n𝑐₀ = 0\n𝑐₁ = 0\n𝑐₂ = 0\n𝑐₃ = 2\n𝑐𝑛 = 0 for 𝑛 > 3\n\nThe Fourier series for 𝑓(𝑡) is then:\n\n𝑓(𝑡) = 0 + ∑(𝑛=1)^∞ (𝑐𝑛⋅cos(n𝑡) + 𝑠𝑛⋅sin(n𝑡))\n       = 3sin(2𝑡) + 2cos(3𝑡)"
