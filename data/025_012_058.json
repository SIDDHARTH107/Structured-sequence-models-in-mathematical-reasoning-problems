    "message_2": "To find the point of order 3 on the elliptic curve E over the finite field with 7 elements (F_7), we will first find all the points on the curve and then check which of these points have order 3.\n\nThe elliptic curve equation is y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 4. We will work in the finite field F_7, so all the calculations will be done modulo 7.\n\nFirst, let's find all the points on the curve:\n\nFor x = 0 to 6, calculate the corresponding y values:\n\nx = 0: y^2 = (0)^3 - 4(0) + 4 = 4 => y = 2, 5 (since 2^2 = 5^2 = 4 mod 7)\nx = 1: y^2 = (1)^3 - 4(1) + 4 = 1 => y = 1, 6 (since 1^2 = 6^2 = 1 mod 7)\nx = 2: y^2 = (2)^3 - 4(2) + 4 = 0 => y = 0 (since 0^2 = 0 mod 7)\nx = 3: y^2 = (3)^3 - 4(3) + 4 = 1 => y = 1, 6 (since 1^2 = 6^2 = 1 mod 7)\nx = 4: y^2 = (4)^3 - 4(4) + 4 = 6 => No solution for y (since no square in F_7 equals 6)\nx = 5: y^2 = (5)^3 - 4(5) + 4 = 0 => y = 0 (since 0^2 = 0 mod 7)\nx = 6: y^2 = (6)^3 - 4(6) + 4 = 4 => y = 2, 5 (since 2^2 = 5^2 = 4 mod 7)\n\nSo, the points on the curve are: (0,2), (0,5), (1,1), (1,6), (2,0), (3,1), (3,6), (5,0), (6,2), and (6,5).\n\nNow, let's find the point of order 3. A point P has order 3 if 3P = O (the point at infinity), but 2P â‰  O.\n\nUsing the elliptic curve point addition formulas, we can calculate 2P for each point P:\n\n2(0,2) = (1,1)\n2(0,5) = (1,6)\n2(1,1) = (6,2)\n2(1,6) = (6,5)\n2(2,0) = (2,0) (This point has order 2)\n2(3,1) = (6,5)\n2(3,6) = (6,2)\n2(5,0) = (5,0) (This point has order 2)\n2(6,2) = (1,6)\n2(6,5) = (1,1)\n\nNow, we can calculate 3P for each point P:\n\n3(0,2) = 2(1,1) + (0,2) = (6,2) + (0,2) = (3,6)\n3(0,5) = 2(1,6) + (0,5) = (6,5) + (0,5) = (3,1)\n3(1,1) = 2(6,2) + (1,1) = (1,6) + (1,1) = O (point at infinity)\n3(1,6) = 2(6,5) + (1,6) = (1,1) + (1,6) = O (point at infinity)\n3(3,1) = 2(6,5) + (3,1) = (1,1) + (3,1) = O (point at infinity)\n3(3,6) = 2(6,2) + (3,6) = (1,6) + (3,6) = O (point at infinity)\n3(6,2) = 2(1,6) + (6,2) = (0,5) + (6,2) = (3,1)\n3(6,5) = 2(1,1) + (6,5) = (0,2) + (6,5) = (3,6)\n\nFrom the above calculations, we see that the points (1,1), (1,6), (3,1), and (3,6) have order 3."
