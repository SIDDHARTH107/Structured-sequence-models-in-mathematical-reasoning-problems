    "message_1": "A Sierpinski arrowhead curve is created by taking an equilateral triangle and cutting out the middle third of each side, then forming two new equilateral triangles in the spaces that are left. If we start with an equilateral triangle with a side length of 6 units, how many line segments will there be in the resulting Sierpinski arrowhead curve after 4 iterations?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of line segments in a Sierpinski arrowhead curve after 4 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (2^n - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the formula becomes:\n\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (2^4 - 1)\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (16 - 1)\nNumber of line segments = 3 * 15\nNumber of line segments = 45\n\nSo, there will be 45 line segments in the resulting Sierpinski arrowhead curve after 4 iterations."
