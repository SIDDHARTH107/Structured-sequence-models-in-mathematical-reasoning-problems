    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation on the unit disk with the given initial condition, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$. The heat equation is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$$\n\nSubstituting the separated form of $u$ into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)Y(y)\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2$$\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -k^2$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2 T(t)$\n2) $X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0$\n3) $Y''(y) + k^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for the first equation is:\n\n$$T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2 t}$$\n\nFor the second and third equations, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = C_2 \\cos(kx) + C_3 \\sin(kx)$$\n$$Y(y) = C_4 \\cos(ky) + C_5 \\sin(ky)$$\n\nNow, we need to impose the boundary conditions on the unit disk $D = \\{(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 < 1\\}$. Since the boundary is a circle, it is natural to use polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $x = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y = r\\sin\\theta$. The boundary condition is $u(r = 1, \\theta, t) = 0$. This implies that $X(x)Y(y) = 0$ on the boundary, which means that either $X(x) = 0$ or $Y(y) = 0$. Since the initial condition is given in terms of $x$, we choose $Y(y) = 0$ on the boundary. This means that $C_4 = 0$ and $k = n\\pi$ for integer $n$. Thus, the solution for $Y(y)$ is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C_5 \\sin(n\\pi y)$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for $u(x, y, t)$ as:\n\n$$u(x, y, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n e^{-(n\\pi)^2 t} \\sin(n\\pi x) \\sin(n\\pi y)$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $C_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x, y, t=0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. This gives:\n\n$$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin(n\\pi x) \\sin(n\\pi y)$$\n\nSince the initial condition does not depend on $y$, we have $C_1 = 1$ and $C_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Therefore, the solution for $u(x, y, t)$ is:\n\n$$u(x, y, t) = e^{-(\\pi)^2 t} \\sin(\\pi x) \\sin(\\pi y)$$\n\nNow, we can compute $u(x, y, t)$ at $t = 1$ and $(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)$:\n\n$$u\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0, 1\\right) = e^{-\\pi^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\sin(0) = 0$$\n\nSo, $u\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0, 1\\right) = 0$."
