    "message_2": "Let the sound signal be represented by the function s(t), which is a combination of a 60 Hz sine wave and a 100 Hz cosine wave. We can write s(t) as:\n\ns(t) = A * sin(2 * π * 60 * t) + B * cos(2 * π * 100 * t)\n\nwhere A and B are the amplitudes of the 60 Hz sine wave and the 100 Hz cosine wave, respectively.\n\nTo find the Fourier transform of the signal, we'll use the following formula:\n\nS(f) = ∫[s(t) * e^(-j * 2 * π * f * t)] dt\n\nwhere S(f) is the Fourier transform of s(t), j is the imaginary unit, and f is the frequency.\n\nWe'll compute the Fourier transform separately for the sine and cosine components:\n\nFourier transform of A * sin(2 * π * 60 * t):\n\n∫[A * sin(2 * π * 60 * t) * e^(-j * 2 * π * f * t)] dt\n\nFourier transform of B * cos(2 * π * 100 * t):\n\n∫[B * cos(2 * π * 100 * t) * e^(-j * 2 * π * f * t)] dt\n\nNow, we know that the Fourier transform of a sine function is:\n\nF{sin(2 * π * a * t)} = (j/2) * [δ(f - a) - δ(f + a)]\n\nand the Fourier transform of a cosine function is:\n\nF{cos(2 * π * a * t)} = (1/2) * [δ(f - a) + δ(f + a)]\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nApplying these formulas to our sine and cosine components, we get:\n\nFourier transform of A * sin(2 * π * 60 * t) = (j * A / 2) * [δ(f - 60) - δ(f + 60)]\n\nFourier transform of B * cos(2 * π * 100 * t) = (B / 2) * [δ(f - 100) + δ(f + 100)]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of the entire signal s(t) by adding the Fourier transforms of the sine and cosine components:\n\nS(f) = (j * A / 2) * [δ(f - 60) - δ(f + 60)] + (B / 2) * [δ(f - 100) + δ(f + 100)]\n\nThe amplitudes of the spectral components corresponding to the 60 Hz sine wave and the 100 Hz cosine wave can be found by looking at the coefficients of the Dirac delta functions:\n\nAmplitude of 60 Hz sine wave component = A\nAmplitude of 100 Hz cosine wave component = B"
