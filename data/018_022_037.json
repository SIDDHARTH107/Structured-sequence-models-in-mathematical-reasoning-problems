    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A) and verify mathematically that it is not equal to the Cartesian product of (B Δ A) and (A Δ B), thus proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, and B and A.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 3, 4, 1} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A):\n\n(A Δ B) × (B Δ A) = {1, 4} × {1, 4} = {(1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (B Δ A) and (A Δ B):\n\n(B Δ A) × (A Δ B) = {1, 4} × {1, 4} = {(1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4)}\n\nAs we can see, the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A) is equal to the Cartesian product of (B Δ A) and (A Δ B):\n\n(A Δ B) × (B Δ A) = (B Δ A) × (A Δ B) = {(1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4)}\n\nThus, the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to Cartesian product, contrary to the initial claim."
