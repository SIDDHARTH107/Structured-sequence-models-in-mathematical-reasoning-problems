    "message_1": "A chemical reaction takes place in a tank with a volume of 500 liters. The rate at which the reaction occurs, r(t), in liters per minute, is determined by the function r(t) = t^2 - 5t + 7. Use the mean value theorem to determine if there exists a particular time during a 2 minute period where the reaction is occurring at an average rate of 50 liters per minute.",
    "message_2": "To use the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to find the total change in the reaction volume over the 2-minute period. We can do this by integrating the rate function r(t) over the interval [0, 2].\n\nâˆ«(t^2 - 5t + 7) dt from 0 to 2\n\n= (t^3/3 - (5/2)t^2 + 7t) evaluated from 0 to 2\n\n= [(2^3/3 - (5/2)(2^2) + 7(2)) - (0^3/3 - (5/2)(0^2) + 7(0))]\n\n= [(8/3 - 20 + 14) - (0)]\n\n= [(8/3 - 6/3 + 42/3)]\n\n= 44/3 liters\n\nNow, we need to find the average rate of the reaction over the 2-minute period:\n\nAverage rate = (Total change in volume) / (Time interval)\n\nAverage rate = (44/3) / 2\n\nAverage rate = 22/3 liters per minute\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the interval [a, b], then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the instantaneous rate of change at c is equal to the average rate of change over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, we want to find if there exists a time c during the 2-minute period where the reaction is occurring at an average rate of 50 liters per minute. Since the average rate we calculated is 22/3 liters per minute, which is not equal to 50 liters per minute, there is no time during the 2-minute period where the reaction is occurring at an average rate of 50 liters per minute according to the Mean Value Theorem."
