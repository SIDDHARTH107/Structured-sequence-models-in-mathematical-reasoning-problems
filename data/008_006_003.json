    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. In this case, we have:\n\nA - λI = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 - λ & -1 \\\\ 4 & -2 - λ \\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we need to find the determinant of this matrix:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)(-2 - λ) - (-1)(4) = λ^2 - λ - 6\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - λ - 6 = 0\n\nFactoring the equation, we get:\n\n(λ - 3)(λ + 2) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = -2.\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. Let's start with λ1 = 3:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ1 = 3 into the matrix A - λI:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 4 & -5 \\end{bmatrix}v1 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this system of equations as:\n\n-1 * v1_y = 0\n4 * v1_x - 5 * v1_y = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we get v1_y = 0. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n4 * v1_x = 0\n\nSo, v1_x = 0. Therefore, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 = 3 is:\n\nv1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nHowever, this is not a valid eigenvector since it is a zero vector. It seems we made a mistake in calculating the eigenvalues. Let's go back and check our calculations.\n\nThe characteristic equation was:\n\nλ^2 - λ - 6 = 0\n\nWe factored it as:\n\n(λ - 3)(λ + 2) = 0\n\nHowever, this is incorrect. The correct factorization should be:\n\n(λ - 3)(λ + 1) = 0\n\nSo, the correct eigenvalues are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = -1. Now, let's find the eigenvectors again.\n\nFor λ1 = 3:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ1 = 3 into the matrix A - λI:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 4 & -5 \\end{bmatrix}v1 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this system of equations as:\n\n-1 * v1_y = 0\n4 * v1_x - 5 * v1_y = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we get v1_y = 0. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n4 * v1_x = 0\n\nSo, v1_x = 0. Therefore, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 = 3 is:\n\nv1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ2 = -1 into the matrix A - λI:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 4 & -1 \\\\ 4 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}v2 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this system of equations as:\n\n4 * v2_x - v2_y = 0\n4 * v2_x - v2_y = 0\n\nThese two equations are the same, so we can use the first one:\n\n4 * v2_x - v2_y = 0\n\nLet v2_x = 1, then v2_y = 4. Therefore, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 = -1 is:\n\nv2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nSo, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 3, Eigenvector v1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\nEigenvalue λ2 = -1, Eigenvector v2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}"
