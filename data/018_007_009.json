    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. The size of the power set of A is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in A.\n\nIn this case, set A has 5 elements, so the size of the power set of A is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set of A to the size of set A itself. The size of set A is 5, and the size of the power set of A is 32. Clearly, 32 > 5, so the power set of A is larger than A.\n\nTo prove that the power set of A is always larger than A, consider any set A with n elements. The size of the power set of A is 2^n, and the size of set A is n. We want to show that 2^n > n for all n.\n\nFor n = 0, we have 2^0 = 1 > 0, which is true.\n\nNow, let's assume that 2^k > k for some k ≥ 0. We want to show that 2^(k+1) > k+1.\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k > 2 * k (since 2^k > k by our assumption)\n\nNow, we need to show that 2 * k > k + 1. This is equivalent to showing that k > 1, which is true for all k ≥ 1.\n\nThus, by induction, we have shown that the power set of A is always larger than A for all sets A."
