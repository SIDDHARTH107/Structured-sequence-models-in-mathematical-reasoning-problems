    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a hurricane hitting Florida in any given year based on historical data, we can use the following formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of times an event occurred) / (Total number of trials)\n\nIn this case, the event is a hurricane hitting Florida, and the number of trials is the number of years in the historical data.\n\nProbability = (37 hurricanes) / (100 years) = 0.37\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane hitting Florida in any given year, based on historical data, is 0.37 or 37%."
