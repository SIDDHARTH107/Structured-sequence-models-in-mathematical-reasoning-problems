    "message_1": "The data of 50 students in a mathematics class is analyzed for their marks in three subjects - algebra, geometry and trigonometry. The marks in each subject are out of 100. The results of the analysis showed that the average marks in algebra, geometry and trigonometry are 85, 90 and 80 respectively.\n\nUsing multivariate analysis, find the correlation between the marks obtained by the students in algebra, geometry and trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation between the marks obtained by the students in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry using multivariate analysis, we need the covariance matrix and the correlation matrix. However, the given information only provides the average marks for each subject. To calculate the correlation, we need more information, such as the individual scores of each student in each subject or the covariance between the subjects.\n\nIf you can provide the additional information, I can help you calculate the correlation between the marks obtained by the students in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry."
