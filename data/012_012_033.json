    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of a graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. First, consider the minimum number of edges required to form a cycle in a graph. A cycle must have at least 3 edges (forming a triangle).\n\n2. Next, consider the maximum number of edges a graph with 8 vertices can have without forming a cycle. This can be achieved by constructing a tree, which is a connected graph with no cycles. A tree with n vertices has (n-1) edges, so a tree with 8 vertices has 7 edges.\n\n3. Since our graph has 10 edges, which is 3 more than the maximum number of edges in a tree with 8 vertices, we know that there must be at least one cycle in the graph.\n\n4. To minimize the girth, we can start by adding one edge to the tree, which will create a cycle. The shortest cycle we can create by adding one edge is a triangle (3 edges). \n\n5. Now, we still have 2 more edges to add. If we add another edge that connects two vertices already in the triangle, we will create another triangle. However, if we add an edge that connects a vertex in the triangle to a vertex not in the triangle, we will create a cycle of length 4.\n\n6. Finally, we have one more edge to add. If we add it to connect two vertices already in the cycle of length 4, we will create another cycle of length 4. However, if we add it to connect a vertex in the cycle of length 4 to a vertex not in the cycle, we will create a cycle of length 5.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges is 3, as it is the shortest possible cycle in the graph."
