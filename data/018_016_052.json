    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA x B = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A x B and B x A.\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nThe union of two sets is commutative, meaning that (A x B) ∪ (B x A) = (B x A) ∪ (A x B). However, the Cartesian product itself is not commutative, as A x B ≠ B x A. This is because the order of the elements in the ordered pairs matters.\n\nIn this case, A x B = {(1, 3), (2, 3)} and B x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2)}, which are not equal. Therefore, the Cartesian product is not commutative."
