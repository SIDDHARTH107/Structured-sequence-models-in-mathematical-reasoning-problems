The heights are as follows: 62, 65, 67, 68, 64, 69, 63, 66, 65, 70, 71, 66, 73, 67, 65, 68, 70, 67, 63, 65, 69, 72, 71, 68, 67, 65, 62, 69, 63, 64, 68, 70, 66, 63, 65, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 67, 66, 69, 67, 68, 64, 71, 69, 65, 68. Calculate the sample mean, median and mode for this data set.",
    "message_2": "First, let's sort the data in ascending order:\n\n62, 62, 63, 63, 63, 63, 64, 64, 64, 64, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 66, 66, 66, 66, 66, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 68, 68, 68, 68, 68, 68, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 70, 70, 70, 71, 71, 72, 72, 73\n\nSample Mean:\nTo calculate the sample mean, we sum up all the heights and divide by the total number of students (50).\n\nMean = (62+62+63+63+63+63+64+64+64+64+65+65+65+65+65+65+66+66+66+66+66+67+67+67+67+67+67+68+68+68+68+68+68+69+69+69+69+69+70+70+70+71+71+72+72+73) / 50\n\nMean = 3342 / 50 = 66.84 inches\n\nSample Median:\nSince there are 50 students (an even number), the median will be the average of the 25th and 26th values in the sorted list.\n\nMedian = (67 + 67) / 2 = 134 / 2 = 67 inches\n\nSample Mode:\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. We can see that 65, 66, 67, and 68 each appear 6 times, which is the highest frequency.\n\nMode = 65, 66, 67, 68\n\nSo, the sample mean is 66.84 inches, the median is 67 inches, and the mode is 65, 66, 67, and 68 inches."
