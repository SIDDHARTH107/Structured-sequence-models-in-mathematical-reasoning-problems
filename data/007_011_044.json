    "message_2": "To determine if 57 is a quadratic residue modulo 83, we can use the Legendre symbol. The Legendre symbol (a|p) is defined as:\n\n(a|p) = 1 if a is a quadratic residue modulo p and a is not divisible by p\n(a|p) = -1 if a is not a quadratic residue modulo p\n(a|p) = 0 if a is divisible by p\n\nHere, a = 57 and p = 83 (a prime number).\n\nWe can compute the Legendre symbol using Euler's criterion:\n\n(a|p) = a^((p-1)/2) (mod p)\n\nSo, (57|83) = 57^((83-1)/2) (mod 83) = 57^41 (mod 83).\n\nUsing a modular exponentiation algorithm, we find that:\n\n57^41 (mod 83) = 1\n\nSince the Legendre symbol (57|83) = 1, 57 is a quadratic residue modulo 83.\n\nNow, we need to find one of its square roots. We can use the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm to find a square root of 57 modulo 83.\n\n1. Find the factors of 83 - 1 = 82. The prime factors are 2 and 41.\n2. Write 82 as 2^1 * 41.\n3. Choose a random number n, such that (n|83) = -1. Let's try n = 2.\n   Calculate (2|83) = 2^((83-1)/2) (mod 83) = 2^41 (mod 83) = -1. So, n = 2 works.\n4. Set Q = 41, S = 1, and R = 57^((Q+1)/2) (mod 83) = 57^21 (mod 83) = 58.\n5. Set t = 57^Q (mod 83) = 57^41 (mod 83) = 1.\n6. Set M = S = 1.\n7. Since t = 1, we have found a square root of 57 modulo 83: R = 58.\n\nSo, one of the square roots of 57 modulo 83 is 58."
