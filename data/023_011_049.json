Using the Fourier transform, determine the values of the frequencies present in the input and output signals, and calculate the gain of the system at each frequency.",
    "message_2": "First, let's determine the frequencies present in the input and output signals. The input signal f(t) is given by:\n\nf(t) = cos(4πt)\n\nThis is a cosine function with a frequency of 2 Hz (since the argument of the cosine function is 4πt, and the frequency is half the coefficient of t in the argument).\n\nThe output signal g(t) is given by:\n\ng(t) = 5sin(4πt + π/2) + 3sin(12πt - 3π/4)\n\nThis is a sum of two sine functions with frequencies of 2 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively (since the arguments of the sine functions are 4πt + π/2 and 12πt - 3π/4, and the frequencies are half the coefficients of t in the arguments).\n\nNow, let's calculate the gain of the system at each frequency. The gain is the ratio of the output amplitude to the input amplitude at each frequency.\n\nAt the 2 Hz frequency, the input amplitude is 1 (from the cosine function), and the output amplitude is 5 (from the first sine function). Therefore, the gain at 2 Hz is:\n\nGain(2 Hz) = 5 / 1 = 5\n\nAt the 6 Hz frequency, there is no input signal (the input signal has only one frequency component at 2 Hz), but the output amplitude is 3 (from the second sine function). Therefore, the gain at 6 Hz is:\n\nGain(6 Hz) = 3 / 0\n\nHowever, since the input amplitude is 0 at this frequency, it's not appropriate to calculate the gain in this way. Instead, we can say that the system introduces a new frequency component at 6 Hz with an amplitude of 3.\n\nIn summary, the input signal has a frequency of 2 Hz, and the output signal has frequencies of 2 Hz and 6 Hz. The gain of the system at 2 Hz is 5, and the system introduces a new frequency component at 6 Hz with an amplitude of 3."
