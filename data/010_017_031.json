    "message_2": "The Morse inequalities relate the topology of a compact smooth manifold M to the critical points of a smooth function (called a Morse function) defined on M. In the case of the k-th homology group with coefficients in the field Z2, the Morse inequalities can be stated as follows:\n\nLet M be a compact smooth manifold of dimension n, and let f: M → R be a Morse function on M with a finite number of non-degenerate critical points. Denote by C_k the number of critical points of index k, and let b_k denote the k-th Betti number of M, which is the rank of the k-th homology group with coefficients in the field Z2. Then, for each k = 0, 1, ..., n, the Morse inequalities are given by:\n\nC_k ≥ b_k\n\nMoreover, there is a stronger version of the Morse inequalities, known as the Morse-Betti inequalities, which include alternating sums:\n\nC_0 - C_1 + C_2 - ... + (-1)^k C_k ≥ b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - ... + (-1)^k b_k\n\nThese inequalities provide a connection between the topology of the manifold M (captured by the Betti numbers) and the geometry of M (captured by the critical points of the Morse function f)."
