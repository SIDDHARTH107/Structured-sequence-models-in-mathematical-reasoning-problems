    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one employee commits financial fraud, we can first find the probability that no employee commits financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single employee does not commit financial fraud is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nSince there are 50 employees, the probability that none of them commit financial fraud is (0.98)^50 ≈ 0.3642.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one employee commits financial fraud by subtracting the probability that none of them do:\n\n1 - 0.3642 ≈ 0.6358.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one employee commits financial fraud is approximately 0.6358 or 63.58%."
