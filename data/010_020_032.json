    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology of the pairs (S¹, α) and (S¹, β), we first need to understand the setting. Since α and β are two loops in S¹ homotopic to each other and lying inside the same small ball, we can consider them as two Hamiltonian isotopic loops. Floer homology is an invariant under Hamiltonian isotopy, so the Floer homology of (S¹, α) and (S¹, β) will be isomorphic.\n\nNow, let's compute the Floer homology for one of the loops, say (S¹, α). Since S¹ is a one-dimensional manifold, the Floer homology will be relatively simple. In this case, the Floer homology is isomorphic to the singular homology of the free loop space of S¹, which is the space of all continuous maps from S¹ to itself.\n\nThe singular homology of the free loop space of S¹ can be computed using Morse theory. The Morse complex is generated by the critical points of a Morse function on the free loop space, and the differential counts the number of gradient flow lines between critical points.\n\nIn the case of S¹, there is only one critical point, which corresponds to the constant loop at the basepoint. Therefore, the Morse complex has only one generator, and the differential is trivial. This means that the Floer homology of (S¹, α) is isomorphic to the singular homology of the free loop space of S¹, which is Z in degree 0 and 0 in all other degrees.\n\nSince the Floer homology of (S¹, α) and (S¹, β) are isomorphic, the Floer homology of (S¹, β) is also Z in degree 0 and 0 in all other degrees."
