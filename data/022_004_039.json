    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function $f(z) = \\frac{\\cos z}{\\sin(z- \\frac{\\pi}{3})}$, we need to find the points where the denominator is zero. \n\nThe function $\\sin(z - \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ has zeros at $z = k\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, where $k$ is an integer. We are interested in the zeros within the domain $0 < |z| < \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nLet's find the zeros of the denominator:\n\n1. For $k = 0$, $z = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, which is within the domain.\n2. For $k = 1$, $z = \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$, which is within the domain.\n3. For $k = -1$, $z = -\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, which is within the domain.\n4. For $k = 2$, $z = 2\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{7\\pi}{3}$, which is outside the domain.\n5. For $k = -2$, $z = -2\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = -\\frac{5\\pi}{3}$, which is outside the domain.\n\nSo, we have three zeros of the denominator within the domain: $z = \\frac{\\pi}{3}, -\\frac{2\\pi}{3}, \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$.\n\nNow, let's determine the type of singularities at these points. Since the numerator, $\\cos z$, is nonzero at these points, the singularities are poles. To find the order of the poles, we can look at the order of the zeros in the denominator.\n\nThe function $\\sin(z - \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ has simple zeros (zeros of order 1) at the points we found. Therefore, the function $f(z)$ has simple poles (poles of order 1) at $z = \\frac{\\pi}{3}, -\\frac{2\\pi}{3}, \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ within the domain $0 < |z| < \\frac{5}{2}$."
