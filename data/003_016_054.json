    "message_1": "Suppose we have the function f(x) = 2sin(2x + pi/3). What is the phase shift of this function and in which direction was it shifted (left or right)?",
    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 2sin(2x + pi/3). \n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to look at the term inside the sine function, which is (2x + pi/3). The general form of a sine function with phase shift is sin(B(x - C)), where B is the coefficient of x and C is the phase shift.\n\nTo rewrite our function in this form, we can factor out the 2 from the term inside the sine function:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(2(x + pi/6))\n\nNow we can see that the function is in the form of sin(B(x - C)), with B = 2 and C = -pi/6. The phase shift is C, which is -pi/6.\n\nSince the phase shift is negative, the function is shifted to the right by pi/6 units."
