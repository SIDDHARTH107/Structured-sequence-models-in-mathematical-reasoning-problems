    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard measuring 18 inches by 24 inches has a square cut from each corner. The sides are then turned up to form an open box. What is the maximum volume of the box?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner. After cutting the squares and folding the sides, the dimensions of the open box will be (18-2x) inches by (24-2x) inches by x inches.\n\nThe volume V of the open box can be expressed as:\n\nV(x) = x(18-2x)(24-2x)\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of V(x) with respect to x and setting it to 0:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (18-2x)(24-2x) - 2x(24-2x) - 2x(18-2x) = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get x â‰ˆ 3 inches (approximately).\n\nNow, we plug this value of x back into the volume equation:\n\nV(3) = 3(18-2*3)(24-2*3) = 3(12)(18) = 648 cubic inches\n\nSo, the maximum volume of the open box is approximately 648 cubic inches."
