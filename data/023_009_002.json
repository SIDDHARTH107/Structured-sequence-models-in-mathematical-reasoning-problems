    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to using the Fourier transform to solve boundary value problems:\n\nSuppose a string of length 10 cm is fixed at both ends with no initial displacement. At time t = 0, the string is pulled down 1 cm at x = 5 cm and then released. If the string is allowed to vibrate freely, what is the displacement of the string as a function of time and position, and what is the period of the fundamental frequency of the vibration? (Assume the string has uniform density and is under constant tension.) Use the Fourier transform to solve this boundary value problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the displacement of the string as a function of time and position, which we'll denote as u(x, t). Since the string is initially at rest, we have the following initial conditions:\n\nu(x, 0) = 0 for 0 < x < 5 cm and 5 < x < 10 cm\nu(5, 0) = 1 cm\n\nand the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, t) = u(10, t) = 0 for all t\n\nThe wave equation for a vibrating string with uniform density and constant tension is given by:\n\n∂²u/∂t² = c² ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere c is the wave speed.\n\nTo solve this partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T''(t) = c²X''(x)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by c²X(x)T(t), we obtain:\n\n(T''(t)/c²T(t)) = (X''(x)/X(x))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nT''(t) + c²λ²T(t) = 0\n\nThe boundary conditions for X(x) are:\n\nX(0) = X(10) = 0\n\nThe non-trivial solutions to the ODE for X(x) are given by:\n\nX(x) = sin(λx)\n\nwhere λ = nπ/10 for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe ODE for T(t) has solutions of the form:\n\nT(t) = A_n cos(cλ_nt) + B_n sin(cλ_nt)\n\nSince the string is initially at rest, we have:\n\n∂u/∂t(x, 0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0\n\nThis implies that B_n = 0 for all n. Thus, the solution to the wave equation is given by:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [A_n sin(λ_nx) cos(cλ_nt)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial displacement condition:\n\nu(5, 0) = Σ [A_n sin(λ_n(5))] = 1\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series. We can find the coefficients A_n by multiplying both sides by sin(λ_mx) and integrating from 0 to 10:\n\n∫₀¹⁰ [sin(λ_mx) * u(5, 0)] dx = ∫₀¹⁰ [A_n sin(λ_n(5)) sin(λ_mx)] dx\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of sine functions, we get:\n\nA_n = (2/10) ∫₀¹⁰ [sin(λ_n(5)) sin(λ_nx)] dx\n\nSince u(5, 0) = 1, we have:\n\nA_n = (2/10) ∫₀¹⁰ [sin(λ_n(5)) sin(λ_nx)] dx = (2/10) ∫₀¹⁰ [sin(nπ/2) sin(nπx/10)] dx\n\nNow, we can compute A_n for each n and obtain the displacement function u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(2/10) ∫₀¹⁰ [sin(nπ/2) sin(nπx/10)] dx * sin(nπx/10) * cos(c*nπt/10)]\n\nFinally, the period of the fundamental frequency is given by:\n\nT = 2π/(cλ_1) = 2π/(c(π/10)) = 20/πc\n\nSo, the displacement of the string as a function of time and position is given by u(x, t), and the period of the fundamental frequency of the vibration is 20/πc."
