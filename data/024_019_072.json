    "message_2": "To find the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for the surface S, we first need to compute the Gaussian curvature K and the geodesic curvature k_g of the boundary curve. Then, we can apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem formula:\n\n∫∫_S K dA + ∮_C k_g ds = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface S.\n\n1. Compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nGiven the surface S: z = x^2 + y^2, we can write the parametrization as:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nru = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nruu = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe coefficients of the first fundamental form are:\n\nE = ru·ru = 1 + 4u^2\nF = ru·rv = 2uv\nG = rv·rv = 1 + 4v^2\n\nThe coefficients of the second fundamental form are:\n\ne = n·ruu = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nf = n·ruv = 0\ng = n·rvv = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2) = (4 / (1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)^2)\n\n2. Compute the geodesic curvature k_g of the boundary curve:\n\nSince the surface S is unbounded, there is no boundary curve. Therefore, k_g = 0.\n\n3. Apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\nSince the surface S is unbounded and non-compact, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem does not apply directly. However, we can still compute the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over a compact subdomain of S.\n\nFor a compact subdomain D of S with boundary curve C, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem becomes:\n\n∫∫_D K dA + ∮_C k_g ds = 2πχ(D)\n\nHere, χ(D) is the Euler characteristic of the subdomain D, and k_g is the geodesic curvature of the boundary curve C."
