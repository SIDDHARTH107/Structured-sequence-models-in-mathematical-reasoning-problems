    "message_2": "To determine the fundamental group of X, we first need to understand the space X and its universal cover Y.\n\nThe space X is obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a square. This means that we are gluing the opposite sides of the square together. When we glue the left and right sides together, we get a cylinder. Then, when we glue the top and bottom sides together, we obtain a torus. So, X is topologically equivalent to a torus.\n\nNow, let's consider the universal cover Y of X. The universal cover of a torus is the Euclidean plane ℝ². This is because we can \"unwrap\" the torus onto the plane by considering an infinite grid of squares, where each square is identified with its neighbors in the same way as the original square.\n\nNow that we know X is a torus and Y is the Euclidean plane, we can determine the fundamental group of X. The fundamental group of a space is a group that captures information about the loops in the space, up to homotopy. In the case of a torus, there are two independent loops: one that goes around the \"hole\" in the middle (let's call it loop a) and one that goes around the \"tube\" (let's call it loop b).\n\nThese two loops generate the fundamental group of the torus, and since they do not intersect, they commute with each other. Therefore, the fundamental group of X (the torus) is the free abelian group on two generators, which can be written as:\n\nπ₁(X) = ℤ × ℤ\n\nHere, ℤ denotes the group of integers, and ℤ × ℤ represents the direct product of two copies of ℤ. This means that the fundamental group of X consists of pairs of integers (m, n), where the operation is component-wise addition:\n\n(m₁, n₁) + (m₂, n₂) = (m₁ + m₂, n₁ + n₂)\n\nSo, the fundamental group of X, where X is the space obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a square, is ℤ × ℤ."
