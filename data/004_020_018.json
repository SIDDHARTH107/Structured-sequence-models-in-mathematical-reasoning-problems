    "message_1": "A 10-newton force is applied to an object at a distance of 5 meters from its initial position in the direction of the force. Find the work done by the force in moving the object along the line of the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force in moving the object along the line of the force using integration, we can use the formula for work:\n\nW = ∫F dx\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force, and dx is the infinitesimal displacement along the direction of the force.\n\nIn this case, the force F is constant and equal to 10 N. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\nW = ∫(10) dx\n\nWe need to evaluate this integral over the distance the object is moved, which is 5 meters. So, we integrate from the initial position x=0 to the final position x=5:\n\nW = ∫(10) dx from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nW = [10x] from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = (10 * 5) - (10 * 0)\nW = 50 - 0\nW = 50 J\n\nSo, the work done by the 10-newton force in moving the object 5 meters along the line of the force is 50 joules."
