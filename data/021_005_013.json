    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order ordinary differential equation y' = -2y with the initial condition y(0) = 4 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(t, y) = -2y, which represents the derivative y'.\n2. Set the initial values t0 = 0 and y0 = 4.\n3. Choose the step size h = 0.2.\n4. Apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to find the numerical solution at y(0.4).\n\nThe fourth-order Runge-Kutta method involves the following calculations for each step:\n\nk1 = h * f(t0, y0)\nk2 = h * f(t0 + h/2, y0 + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(t0 + h/2, y0 + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(t0 + h, y0 + k3)\n\ny1 = y0 + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6\nt1 = t0 + h\n\nNow, we will apply these calculations for two steps to reach y(0.4):\n\nStep 1:\nk1 = 0.2 * f(0, 4) = 0.2 * (-2 * 4) = -1.6\nk2 = 0.2 * f(0 + 0.2/2, 4 - 1.6/2) = 0.2 * f(0.1, 2.8) = 0.2 * (-2 * 2.8) = -1.12\nk3 = 0.2 * f(0.1, 2.8 - 1.12/2) = 0.2 * f(0.1, 2.24) = 0.2 * (-2 * 2.24) = -0.896\nk4 = 0.2 * f(0.2, 2.24 - 0.896) = 0.2 * f(0.2, 1.344) = 0.2 * (-2 * 1.344) = -0.5376\n\ny1 = 4 + (-1.6 + 2 * (-1.12) + 2 * (-0.896) + (-0.5376))/6 = 4 - 1.344 = 2.656\nt1 = 0 + 0.2 = 0.2\n\nStep 2:\nk1 = 0.2 * f(0.2, 2.656) = 0.2 * (-2 * 2.656) = -1.0624\nk2 = 0.2 * f(0.2 + 0.2/2, 2.656 - 1.0624/2) = 0.2 * f(0.3, 2.1248) = 0.2 * (-2 * 2.1248) = -0.84992\nk3 = 0.2 * f(0.3, 2.1248 - 0.84992/2) = 0.2 * f(0.3, 1.69984) = 0.2 * (-2 * 1.69984) = -0.679936\nk4 = 0.2 * f(0.4, 1.69984 - 0.679936) = 0.2 * f(0.4, 1.019904) = 0.2 * (-2 * 1.019904) = -0.4079616\n\ny2 = 2.656 + (-1.0624 + 2 * (-0.84992) + 2 * (-0.679936) + (-0.4079616))/6 = 2.656 - 0.6719744 = 1.9840256\nt2 = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4\n\nSo, the numerical solution at y(0.4) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is approximately y(0.4) â‰ˆ 1.984."
