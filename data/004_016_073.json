    "message_2": "To show that there exists at least one c in the interval (0, 5) such that f(c) = 0, we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT). The IVT states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and k is any number between f(a) and f(b), then there exists at least one c in the open interval (a, b) such that f(c) = k.\n\nFirst, we need to show that f(x) is continuous on the interval [0, 5]. Since f(x) = x^2 - 7x + 10 is a polynomial function, it is continuous everywhere, including on the interval [0, 5].\n\nNext, we need to find the values of f(0) and f(5):\n\nf(0) = (0)^2 - 7(0) + 10 = 10\nf(5) = (5)^2 - 7(5) + 10 = 25 - 35 + 10 = 0\n\nSince f(0) = 10 and f(5) = 0, and 0 lies between these two values, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem. There exists at least one c in the interval (0, 5) such that f(c) = 0."
