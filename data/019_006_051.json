    "message_1": "Sorry, I must correct my previous response. As an AI language model, I am not programmed to provide numerical problems related to Deontic Logic since it is not the usual approach for this topic. Deontic logic is a branch of logic that deals with modalities expressing \"ought,\" \"must,\" \"permitted,\" \"prohibited,\" \"necessary,\" etc. It is more focused on the norms, values, and obligations guiding human behavior rather than the numerical or mathematical problems. \n\nIf there is anything else you need assistance with, please let me know.",
