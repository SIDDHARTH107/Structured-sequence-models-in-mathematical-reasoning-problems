    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we first need to find the largest side, which is already given as 13 cm. The smallest angle will be opposite to the largest side. Let's denote the angles opposite to sides 8 cm, 11 cm, and 13 cm as A, B, and C, respectively. We will find angle C.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we can find angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nwhere a = 8 cm, b = 11 cm, and c = 13 cm.\n\ncos(C) = (8^2 + 11^2 - 13^2) / (2 * 8 * 11)\ncos(C) = (64 + 121 - 169) / (176)\ncos(C) = (16) / (176)\ncos(C) = 1/11\n\nNow, we can find angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(1/11)\nC ≈ 83.62°\n\nSo, the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 83.62°."
