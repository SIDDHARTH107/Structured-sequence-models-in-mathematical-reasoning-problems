    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change after any number of iterations. It remains constant and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, N = 4 (each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments) and the scaling factor s = 3 (each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the 4th iteration (or any iteration) is approximately 1.2619."
