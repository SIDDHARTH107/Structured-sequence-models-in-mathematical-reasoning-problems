    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,2) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. \n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the metric tensor, which we can compute by taking the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to the parameters x and y.\n\nLet's define the position vector R(x, y) = (x, y, x^2 + y^2). Then, we have:\n\nR_x = ∂R/∂x = (1, 0, 2x)\nR_y = ∂R/∂y = (0, 1, 2y)\n\nNow, we can compute the metric tensor G_ij:\n\nG_11 = R_x • R_x = (1, 0, 2x) • (1, 0, 2x) = 1 + 4x^2\nG_12 = R_x • R_y = (1, 0, 2x) • (0, 1, 2y) = 4xy\nG_21 = R_y • R_x = (0, 1, 2y) • (1, 0, 2x) = 4xy\nG_22 = R_y • R_y = (0, 1, 2y) • (0, 1, 2y) = 1 + 4y^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nG_11 = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nG_12 = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG_21 = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG_22 = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nNow, let's compute the second fundamental form. We first need to find the normal vector N at the point (1,1,2). The normal vector is given by the cross product of R_x and R_y:\n\nN = R_x × R_y = (1, 0, 2x) × (0, 1, 2y) = (-4x, -4y, 1)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nN = (-4, -4, 1)\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form components L_ij:\n\nL_11 = N • R_xx = (-4, -4, 1) • (0, 0, 2) = 2\nL_12 = N • R_xy = (-4, -4, 1) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\nL_21 = N • R_yx = (-4, -4, 1) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\nL_22 = N • R_yy = (-4, -4, 1) • (0, 0, 2) = 2\n\nNow, we can compute the principal curvatures k_1 and k_2 by solving the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(L - kG) = 0\n\n| L_11 - kG_11, L_12 - kG_12 |\n| L_21 - kG_21, L_22 - kG_22 |\n\n| 2 - 5k, -4k |\n| -4k, 2 - 5k |\n\n(2 - 5k)(2 - 5k) - (-4k)(-4k) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n25k^2 - 20k + 4 - 16k^2 = 0\n9k^2 - 20k + 4 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation for k, we get:\n\nk_1 = (20 + sqrt(20^2 - 4 * 9 * 4)) / (2 * 9) = 2\nk_2 = (20 - sqrt(20^2 - 4 * 9 * 4)) / (2 * 9) = 1/3\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,2) are k_1 = 2 and k_2 = 1/3."
