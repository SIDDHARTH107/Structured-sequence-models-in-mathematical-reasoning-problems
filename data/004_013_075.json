    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 5$ over the interval $[0, 4]$, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 5) = 3x^2 - 6x - 9$\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n$3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first divide by 3 to simplify:\n\n$x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic:\n\n$(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$\n\nSo, the critical points are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. However, since the interval we are considering is $[0, 4]$, we only need to consider the critical point $x = 3$.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval:\n\n$f(0) = (0)^3 - 3(0)^2 - 9(0) + 5 = 5$\n\n$f(3) = (3)^3 - 3(3)^2 - 9(3) + 5 = 27 - 27 - 27 + 5 = -22$\n\n$f(4) = (4)^3 - 3(4)^2 - 9(4) + 5 = 64 - 48 - 36 + 5 = -15$\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function over the interval $[0, 4]$ is $5$ at $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $-22$ at $x = 3$."
