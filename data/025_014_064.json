    "message_2": "To show that setting $z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$ in $\\theta(z)$ gives an algebraic number, we first need to understand the properties of the theta function and the complex multiplication.\n\nWhen $C$ has complex multiplication, the endomorphism ring $End(C)$ is isomorphic to the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the imaginary quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$. This implies that the action of the endomorphisms on the points of $C$ can be described using the elements of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. In particular, the action of the endomorphisms on the periods of $C$ can be described using the elements of $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nNow, let $z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$. Then, $q = e^{2\\pi i z} = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{\\sqrt{d}}}$. We can rewrite the theta function as:\n\n$$ \\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\frac{2\\pi i n^2}{\\sqrt{d}}} $$\n\nSince the action of the endomorphisms on the periods of $C$ can be described using the elements of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, the theta function $\\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)$ is invariant under the action of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. This means that $\\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)$ is fixed by the Galois group of the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})/\\mathbb{Q}$, and hence it is an algebraic number.\n\nNow, let's find the algebraic number for the special case $d = 7$. In this case, $z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}$ and $q = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{\\sqrt{7}}}$. The theta function is:\n\n$$ \\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\frac{2\\pi i n^2}{\\sqrt{7}}} $$\n\nTo compute this sum, we can truncate it to a finite number of terms, say $N$, and obtain an approximation:\n\n$$ \\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right) \\approx \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} e^{\\frac{2\\pi i n^2}{\\sqrt{7}}} $$\n\nAs $N$ increases, the approximation becomes more accurate. However, finding an exact expression for the algebraic number is difficult, and it is typically represented as a series or a numerical approximation."
