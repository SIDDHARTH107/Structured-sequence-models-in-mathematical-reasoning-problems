    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -3 & 7 \\\\ 2 & -3 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 3 & 1 & -2 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the $x$ terms below the first row.\n\nSubtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -3 & 7 \\\\ 0 & -7 & 7 & -15 \\\\ 0 & -5 & 7 & -16 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -3 & 7 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 15/7 \\\\ 0 & -5 & 7 & -16 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the $y$ terms below the second row.\n\nAdd 5 times the second row to the third row:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -3 & 7 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 15/7 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & -3 & 7 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 15/7 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1/2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow we perform back substitution:\n\nFrom the third row, we have $z = 1/2$.\n\nFrom the second row, we have $y - z = 15/7 \\Rightarrow y = 15/7 + 1/2 = 22/7$.\n\nFrom the first row, we have $x + 2y - 3z = 7 \\Rightarrow x = 7 - 2(22/7) + 3(1/2) = 7 - 44/7 + 3/2 = 49/14$.\n\nSo the solution is $x = 49/14$, $y = 22/7$, and $z = 1/2$."
