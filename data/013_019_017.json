    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a game of Cheap Talk. Alice has either a red or a blue card, and Bob has to guess which card she has. Before guessing, Alice is allowed to make a statement. Alice can lie, but if she does, she will receive a penalty of 2 points. The payoff matrix for this game is as follows:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Bob guesses Red</th>\n<th>Bob guesses Blue</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Alice says \"Red\"</td>\n<td>2, 0</td>\n<td>-2, 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alice says \"Blue\"</td>\n<td>-2, 2</td>\n<td>0, 0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nAssuming both players are rational and try to maximize their own payoff, what statement should Alice make and what should Bob guess to maximize their respective payoffs?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, we can analyze the payoff matrix.\n\nIf Alice has a red card:\n- If she says \"Red\" and Bob guesses Red, Alice gets 2 points.\n- If she says \"Blue\" and Bob guesses Red, Alice gets -2 points.\n- If she says \"Red\" and Bob guesses Blue, Alice gets -2 points.\n- If she says \"Blue\" and Bob guesses Blue, Alice gets 0 points.\n\nIf Alice has a blue card:\n- If she says \"Red\" and Bob guesses Red, Alice gets -2 points.\n- If she says \"Blue\" and Bob guesses Red, Alice gets 0 points.\n- If she says \"Red\" and Bob guesses Blue, Alice gets 2 points.\n- If she says \"Blue\" and Bob guesses Blue, Alice gets 0 points.\n\nAlice should always tell the truth to maximize her payoff. If she has a red card, she should say \"Red,\" and if she has a blue card, she should say \"Blue.\"\n\nNow let's analyze Bob's strategy. If Alice says \"Red,\" Bob should guess Red, as he has no reason to believe Alice is lying. If Alice says \"Blue,\" Bob should guess Blue for the same reason.\n\nIn conclusion, Alice should always tell the truth about her card, and Bob should guess the color that Alice says. This way, both players maximize their respective payoffs."
