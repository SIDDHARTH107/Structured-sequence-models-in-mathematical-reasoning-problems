    "message_2": "A simplicial complex is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Every face of a simplex in the set is also in the set.\n2. The intersection of any two simplices in the set is a face of both of them.\n\nThe dimension of a simplicial complex is the largest dimension of its simplices. In this case, we have:\n\n- 5 vertices (0-dimensional simplices)\n- 7 edges (1-dimensional simplices)\n- 3 faces (2-dimensional simplices)\n\nSince there are 2-dimensional simplices (faces) in the simplicial complex K, the dimension of K is 2."
