    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal pattern that can be constructed by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial segment length * 2^(Iteration - 1)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1, and we want to find the total length of the 5th iteration. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * 2^(5 - 1)\nLength = 1 * 2^4\nLength = 1 * 16\nLength = 16\n\nSo, the total length of the 5th iteration of the Dragon curve is 16."
