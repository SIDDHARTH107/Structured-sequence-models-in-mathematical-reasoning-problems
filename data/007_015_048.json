    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1000, we need to find the smallest value of n such that M_n is prime and greater than 1000.\n\nWe can start by testing values of n:\n\nn = 11: M_11 = 2^11 - 1 = 2047, which is not prime (23 * 89 = 2047)\nn = 12: M_12 = 2^12 - 1 = 4095, which is not prime (3 * 5 * 7 * 41 = 4095)\nn = 13: M_13 = 2^13 - 1 = 8191, which is prime\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1000 is 8191, with n = 13."
