    "message_2": "To find the area of the slice you ate, we need to first find the area of the entire pizza and then find the fraction of the pizza that corresponds to the 60-degree slice.\n\nThe area of a circle can be found using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the pizza is 14 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 7 inches.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the entire pizza:\nA = π(7^2) = 49π square inches.\n\nNext, we need to find the fraction of the pizza that corresponds to the 60-degree slice. A full circle has 360 degrees, so the fraction of the pizza that you ate is 60/360 = 1/6.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the slice you ate by multiplying the area of the entire pizza by the fraction of the pizza that you ate:\n\nArea of the slice = (1/6) * 49π = 49π/6 ≈ 25.75 square inches."
