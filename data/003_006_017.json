    "message_2": "Let's denote the triangle as ABC, where angle A = 75 degrees, angle B = 40 degrees, and side a (opposite angle A) = 6 meters. We want to find the length of side b (opposite angle B).\n\nFirst, we need to find angle C. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\nangle C = 180 - angle A - angle B\nangle C = 180 - 75 - 40\nangle C = 65 degrees\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the length of side b:\n\n(sin A) / a = (sin B) / b\n\nPlugging in the values we know:\n\n(sin 75) / 6 = (sin 40) / b\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb = (6 * sin 40) / sin 75\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values:\n\nb ≈ (6 * 0.6427876) / 0.9659258\nb ≈ 3.8567256 / 0.9659258\nb ≈ 3.989427\n\nSo, the length of side b (opposite angle B) is approximately 3.99 meters."
