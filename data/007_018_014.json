    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than or equal to 10,000, we need to find the first pair of primes with the smallest difference.\n\nThe first few prime numbers greater than 10,000 are 10,007, 10,037, and 10,049. The differences between these consecutive primes are:\n\n10,037 - 10,007 = 30\n10,049 - 10,037 = 12\n\nThe smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than or equal to 10,000 is 12, which occurs between the primes 10,037 and 10,049."
