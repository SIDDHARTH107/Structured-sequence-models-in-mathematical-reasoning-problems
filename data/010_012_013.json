Define a map f: A -> A by f (X) = X^2, where X^2 denotes the matrix product of X with itself. Find all the points in the space A at which f is not a smooth map.",
    "message_2": "To find the points in A at which f is not a smooth map, we need to compute the derivative of f and find where it fails to be continuous or does not exist.\n\nLet X be an invertible 2x2 matrix with entries a, b, c, and d:\n\nX = | a  b |\n    | c  d |\n\nThen, X^2 = | a^2 + bc  ab + bd |\n            | ac + cd  bc + d^2 |\n\nThe map f is given by:\n\nf(X) = X^2 = | a^2 + bc  ab + bd |\n             | ac + cd  bc + d^2 |\n\nNow, we compute the Jacobian matrix J(f) of f, which is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of f with respect to the entries of X:\n\nJ(f) = | ∂(a^2 + bc)/∂a  ∂(a^2 + bc)/∂b  ∂(a^2 + bc)/∂c  ∂(a^2 + bc)/∂d |\n       | ∂(ab + bd)/∂a   ∂(ab + bd)/∂b   ∂(ab + bd)/∂c   ∂(ab + bd)/∂d  |\n       | ∂(ac + cd)/∂a   ∂(ac + cd)/∂b   ∂(ac + cd)/∂c   ∂(ac + cd)/∂d  |\n       | ∂(bc + d^2)/∂a  ∂(bc + d^2)/∂b  ∂(bc + d^2)/∂c  ∂(bc + d^2)/∂d |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(f) = | 2a  c  b  0  |\n       | b   a  0  b+d |\n       | c   0  a+d  c |\n       | 0   c  b  2d |\n\nFor f to be smooth at a point X in A, the Jacobian matrix J(f) must be continuous and have full rank at that point. Since the Jacobian matrix is a polynomial in the entries of X, it is continuous everywhere. Therefore, we only need to check where the Jacobian matrix fails to have full rank.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J(f) has full rank if and only if its determinant is nonzero. Computing the determinant of J(f), we get:\n\ndet(J(f)) = 2a(2d(ad - bc)) - c^2(ad - bc) - b^2(ad - bc) = (2a - c^2 - b^2)(ad - bc)\n\nSince X is invertible, ad - bc ≠ 0. Therefore, the determinant of J(f) is nonzero if and only if 2a - c^2 - b^2 ≠ 0.\n\nSo, the points in A at which f is not a smooth map are the points X = | a  b |\n                                                                        | c  d |\nsuch that 2a - c^2 - b^2 = 0."
