    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will first analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems. Since the order of G is 8, we know that G has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 2 and divides the order of G, which is 8. Therefore, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup in G, and it must be a normal subgroup.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since P is normal in G and has order 8, we know that P is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, C4 × C2, or Q8. We will now analyze each of these cases and show that G is isomorphic to one of the desired groups.\n\nCase 1: P is isomorphic to C8.\nIn this case, G has an element of order 8, and G is a cyclic group of order 8. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nCase 2: P is isomorphic to C4 × C2.\nIn this case, G has an element of order 4 and an element of order 2. We can define a mapping φ: G → D4 as follows:\n\nLet a be an element of order 4 in G, and let b be an element of order 2 in G such that ab ≠ ba. Define φ(a) = r and φ(b) = s, where r and s are the standard generators of D4 (i.e., r has order 4, s has order 2, and rs = sr^(-1)). Then, φ is an isomorphism between G and D4.\n\nCase 3: P is isomorphic to Q8.\nIn this case, G has elements of order 4 and 2, and the elements of order 4 do not commute with each other. We can define a mapping ψ: G → Q8 as follows:\n\nLet i, j, and k be the standard generators of Q8 (i.e., i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1). Let x, y, and z be elements of G such that x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = xyz = a, where a is an element of order 2 in G. Define ψ(x) = i, ψ(y) = j, and ψ(z) = k. Then, ψ is an isomorphism between G and Q8.\n\nIn each of these cases, we have shown that G is isomorphic to either C8, D4, or Q8. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of these groups."
