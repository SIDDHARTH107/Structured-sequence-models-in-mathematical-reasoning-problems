    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Segment Length * 2^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1, and we want to find the total length after the 10th iteration. So, we plug the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * 2^10\n\nLength = 1 * 1024\n\nLength = 1024\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon Curve after the 10th iteration is 1024."
