    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle and the concept of Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer r such that any graph with r vertices contains either a clique of size m (a complete subgraph with m vertices, where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge) or an independent set of size n (a set of n vertices with no edges between them).\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the smallest number of people (vertices) needed to guarantee a group of 3 friends (a clique of size 3) or a group of 3 strangers (an independent set of size 3). This corresponds to the Ramsey number R(3, 3).\n\nTo find R(3, 3), we can use the upper bound formula for Ramsey numbers: R(m, n) ≤ R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1) for m, n ≥ 2. Using this formula, we can calculate R(3, 3) as follows:\n\nR(3, 3) ≤ R(2, 3) + R(3, 2)\n\nSince R(2, n) = n and R(m, 2) = m for any m, n ≥ 2, we have:\n\nR(3, 3) ≤ 3 + 3 = 6\n\nNow, we need to show that there exists a graph with 5 vertices that does not contain a clique of size 3 or an independent set of size 3. Consider a graph with 5 vertices, where each vertex is connected to exactly 2 other vertices (forming a pentagon). In this graph, there is no clique of size 3 (no triangle) and no independent set of size 3 (no three vertices without edges between them).\n\nTherefore, R(3, 3) = 6. The minimum number of people that must be invited to a party so that there is a group of 3 people who are all friends with each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other is 6."
