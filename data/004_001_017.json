    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 1 with respect to x, we will use the power rule. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nThe derivative of 2x^2 with respect to x is 4x (since 2 * 2x^(2-1) = 4x).\n\nThe derivative of -5x with respect to x is -5 (since -5 * x^(1-1) = -5).\n\nThe derivative of the constant term 1 with respect to x is 0 (since the derivative of a constant is always 0).\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 4x - 5\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 1 with respect to x is f'(x) = 4x - 5."
