    "message_1": "Suppose that in a certain country's parliament of 150 members, there are 75 men and 75 women. If a committee of 5 members is randomly selected, what is the probability that the committee consists of 3 women and 2 men?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability, we will use the formula for combinations and the concept of probability.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of ways to choose a committee of 5 members from 150 members. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of members, k is the number of members to be chosen, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose a committee of 5 members from 150 members:\nC(150, 5) = 150! / (5!(150-5)!) = 150! / (5!145!) = 3,491,534\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 women from 75 women and 2 men from 75 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 women from 75 women:\nC(75, 3) = 75! / (3!(75-3)!) = 75! / (3!72!) = 68,475\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 men from 75 men:\nC(75, 2) = 75! / (2!(75-2)!) = 75! / (2!73!) = 2,775\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose 3 women and 2 men to find the total number of ways to choose a committee with 3 women and 2 men.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose a committee with 3 women and 2 men:\n68,475 * 2,775 = 189,862,125\n\nFinally, we will find the probability by dividing the number of ways to choose a committee with 3 women and 2 men by the total number of ways to choose a committee of 5 members.\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose a committee with 3 women and 2 men) / (Total number of ways to choose a committee of 5 members)\nProbability = 189,862,125 / 3,491,534 â‰ˆ 0.5437\n\nSo, the probability that the committee consists of 3 women and 2 men is approximately 0.5437 or 54.37%."
