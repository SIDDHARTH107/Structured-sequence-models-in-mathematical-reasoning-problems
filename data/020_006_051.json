    "message_1": "Consider a company that produces three products: A, B, and C. The company has 4 machines that can be used for production, but each machine can only be used for one product at a time. The production times for each product on each machine are shown in the table below:\n\n|           | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Product A | 2         | 3         | 2         | 1         |\n| Product B | 4         | 1         | 3         | 2         |\n| Product C | 1         | 2         | 2         | 3         |\n\nThe company wants to know the optimal production plan to maximize profit, subject to the following constraints:\n\n- The company can only use each machine for one product at a time.\n- There are only 80 hours of machine time available per week.\n- The profit margin for each unit of product is $10 for A, $15 for B, and $20 for C.\n\nWhat is the optimal production plan (i.e., how much of each product should be produced) to maximize profit while satisfying the constraints?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production plan, we need to calculate the profit per hour for each product on each machine and then allocate the machine time accordingly.\n\nProfit per hour for each product on each machine:\n\n|           | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Product A | 5         | 3.33      | 5         | 10        |\n| Product B | 3.75      | 15        | 5         | 7.5       |\n| Product C | 20        | 10        | 10        | 6.67      |\n\nNow, we need to allocate the machine time to maximize profit. We should assign each machine to the product with the highest profit per hour on that machine:\n\n- Machine 1: Product C (20 $/hour)\n- Machine 2: Product B (15 $/hour)\n- Machine 3: Product A (5 $/hour)\n- Machine 4: Product A (10 $/hour)\n\nNow we need to allocate the 80 hours of machine time available per week:\n\n- Machine 1: 80 hours for Product C\n- Machine 2: 80 hours for Product B\n- Machine 3: 80 hours for Product A\n- Machine 4: 80 hours for Product A\n\nWith this allocation, we can calculate the number of units produced for each product:\n\n- Product A: (80 hours on Machine 3 / 2 hours per unit) + (80 hours on Machine 4 / 1 hour per unit) = 40 + 80 = 120 units\n- Product B: (80 hours on Machine 2 / 1 hour per unit) = 80 units\n- Product C: (80 hours on Machine 1 / 1 hour per unit) = 80 units\n\nThe optimal production plan is to produce 120 units of Product A, 80 units of Product B, and 80 units of Product C."
