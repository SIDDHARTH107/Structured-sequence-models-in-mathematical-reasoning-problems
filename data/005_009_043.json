The results are shown below:\n\nGroup A: 6, 8, 7, 9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7\nGroup B: 5, 4, 7, 6, 4, 2, 8, 6, 5\n\nIs there a significant difference in the level of anxiety between Group A and Group B using Mann-Whitney U test at α = 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the level of anxiety between Group A and Group B using the Mann-Whitney U test at α = 0.05, we first need to calculate the U value and compare it to the critical value.\n\nStep 1: Rank the combined data set\nFirst, we combine the two groups and rank the data from lowest to highest:\n\nGroup A: 6, 8, 7, 9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7\nGroup B: 5, 4, 7, 6, 4, 2, 8, 6, 5\n\nCombined: 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9\n\nRanks: 1, 2, 3.5, 3.5, 6.5, 6.5, 10, 10, 10, 14, 14, 14, 17.5, 17.5, 17.5, 20\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of ranks for each group\nGroup A ranks: 2 + 3.5 + 6.5 + 10 + 14 + 14 + 17.5 + 17.5 = 85\nGroup B ranks: 1 + 3.5 + 6.5 + 10 + 10 + 14 + 17.5 + 17.5 = 80\n\nStep 3: Calculate the U values for each group\nU_A = n_A * n_B + (n_A * (n_A + 1)) / 2 - R_A\nU_B = n_A * n_B + (n_B * (n_B + 1)) / 2 - R_B\n\nWhere n_A and n_B are the number of observations in Group A and Group B, respectively, and R_A and R_B are the sum of ranks for Group A and Group B, respectively.\n\nU_A = 10 * 9 + (10 * 11) / 2 - 85 = 90 + 55 - 85 = 60\nU_B = 10 * 9 + (9 * 10) / 2 - 80 = 90 + 45 - 80 = 55\n\nStep 4: Determine the smaller U value and compare it to the critical value\nThe smaller U value is U_B = 55. We will compare this to the critical value for a two-tailed test at α = 0.05 with n_A = 10 and n_B = 9. Using a Mann-Whitney U test table, we find the critical value to be 40.\n\nSince 55 > 40, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no significant difference in the level of anxiety between Group A and Group B using the Mann-Whitney U test at α = 0.05."
