The temperature varies throughout the day according to the function:\n\nf(t) = 10sin(π/12 t) + 15\n\nwhere t is the number of hours past midnight. What is the average temperature during the 12-hour period from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM?",
    "message_2": "To find the average temperature during the 12-hour period from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, we need to integrate the function f(t) over the interval [6, 18] and then divide by the length of the interval (12 hours).\n\nFirst, let's find the integral of f(t) with respect to t:\n\n∫(10sin(π/12 t) + 15) dt = 10∫sin(π/12 t) dt + 15∫dt\n\nNow, we integrate each part separately:\n\n10∫sin(π/12 t) dt = -10(12/π)cos(π/12 t) + C1 (using substitution: u = π/12 t, du = (π/12) dt)\n\n15∫dt = 15t + C2\n\nSo, the integral of f(t) is:\n\nF(t) = -10(12/π)cos(π/12 t) + 15t + C\n\nNow, we need to find the definite integral over the interval [6, 18]:\n\nF(18) - F(6) = (-10(12/π)cos(π/12 * 18) + 15 * 18) - (-10(12/π)cos(π/12 * 6) + 15 * 6)\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n\ncos(π/12 * 18) = cos(3π/2) = 0\ncos(π/12 * 6) = cos(π/2) = 0\n\nSo, the definite integral becomes:\n\nF(18) - F(6) = (15 * 18) - (15 * 6) = 15 * (18 - 6) = 15 * 12\n\nNow, we find the average temperature by dividing the definite integral by the length of the interval (12 hours):\n\nAverage temperature = (15 * 12) / 12 = 15\n\nSo, the average temperature during the 12-hour period from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM is 15 degrees Celsius."
