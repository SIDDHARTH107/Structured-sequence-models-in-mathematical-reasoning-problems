    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by parametrizing the surface:\n\nParametrization: r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, G) and the second fundamental form (L, M, N):\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nL = r_uu • N = 2\nM = r_uv • N = 0\nN = r_vv • N = 2\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Thus, the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms are:\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 2(1)(1) = 2\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 2\nM = 0\nN = 2\n\nNow, we can compute the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) using the formula:\n\nk1, k2 = (L + N ± sqrt((L - N)^2 + 4M^2)) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nk1, k2 = (2 + 2 ± sqrt((2 - 2)^2 + 4(0)^2)) / (2(5*5 - 2^2))\nk1, k2 = (4 ± 0) / (2(25 - 4))\nk1, k2 = 4 / (2(21))\n\nBoth k1 and k2 are equal:\n\nk1 = k2 = 2/21\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, 1, 2) are k1 = 2/21 and k2 = 2/21."
