Let $g(z)=f(\\bar{z})$, where $\\bar{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z$. Show that $g(z)$ is also holomorphic in $\\mathbb{H}$ and compute $g(-1)$.",
    "message_2": "To show that $g(z)$ is holomorphic in $\\mathbb{H}$, we need to show that it is differentiable in $\\mathbb{H}$. We know that $f(z)$ is holomorphic in $\\mathbb{H}$, so it is differentiable in $\\mathbb{H}$. Let's differentiate $g(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$$\\frac{dg(z)}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} f(\\bar{z}).$$\n\nNow, let's use the chain rule:\n\n$$\\frac{dg(z)}{dz} = \\frac{df(\\bar{z})}{d\\bar{z}} \\cdot \\frac{d\\bar{z}}{dz}.$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is holomorphic, we know that $\\frac{df(\\bar{z})}{d\\bar{z}}$ exists. Also, we have $\\frac{d\\bar{z}}{dz} = 0$ and $\\frac{d\\bar{z}}{d\\bar{z}} = 1$. Thus, we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{dg(z)}{dz} = \\frac{df(\\bar{z})}{d\\bar{z}} \\cdot \\frac{d\\bar{z}}{d\\bar{z}} = \\frac{df(\\bar{z})}{d\\bar{z}}.$$\n\nSince $\\frac{df(\\bar{z})}{d\\bar{z}}$ exists, we can conclude that $g(z)$ is differentiable in $\\mathbb{H}$, and hence, it is holomorphic in $\\mathbb{H}$.\n\nNow, let's compute $g(-1)$. We have:\n\n$$g(-1) = f(\\overline{-1}) = f(1).$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is real-valued on the real axis and $1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have:\n\n$$g(-1) = f(1) \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$"
