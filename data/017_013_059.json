    "message_2": "To prove that there is only one non-abelian group of order 18 up to isomorphism, we will first analyze the possible structures of groups of order 18 and then show that there is only one non-abelian group among them.\n\nA group of order 18 has the prime factorization 18 = 2 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, so there can be either 1 or 9 2-Sylow subgroups. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so there can be only 1 3-Sylow subgroup.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases:\n\n1. There is only one 2-Sylow subgroup and one 3-Sylow subgroup. In this case, both subgroups are normal (since they are unique), and their intersection is trivial (since their orders are coprime). By the product formula, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups, which are isomorphic to Z_2 and Z_9, respectively. Therefore, the group is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_9, which is abelian.\n\n2. There are nine 2-Sylow subgroups and one 3-Sylow subgroup. In this case, the 3-Sylow subgroup is normal, and the group acts on it by conjugation. Since the 3-Sylow subgroup is isomorphic to Z_9, it has an automorphism group of order 6 (Aut(Z_9) ≅ Z_6). The group action induces a homomorphism from the group to Aut(Z_9), with the kernel being the centralizer of the 3-Sylow subgroup. Since the 3-Sylow subgroup is normal, its centralizer must contain it, so the kernel has order at least 9. However, the only possibility for the kernel is to have order 9, as the group has order 18. Therefore, the group is a semidirect product of the 3-Sylow subgroup by a 2-Sylow subgroup.\n\nNow, we need to determine the possible semidirect products. The action of the 2-Sylow subgroup on the 3-Sylow subgroup is determined by an element of order 2 in Aut(Z_9), which is isomorphic to Z_6. There is only one such element, which corresponds to the automorphism x ↦ x^4 in Z_9. Thus, there is only one possible semidirect product, and it is non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one non-abelian group of order 18 up to isomorphism, which is the semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_2 with the action determined by the automorphism x ↦ x^4 in Z_9."
