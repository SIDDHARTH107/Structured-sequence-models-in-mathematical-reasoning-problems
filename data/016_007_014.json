    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each stage, smaller cubes are removed from the larger cube, creating a more complex structure.\n\nIn the first stage, a 3x3x3 cube is formed, and the middle cube of each face and the center cube are removed, leaving 20 cubes.\n\nIn the second stage, the same process is applied to each of the remaining 20 cubes, resulting in 20 * (20) = 400 cubes.\n\nIn the third stage, the process is applied again to each of the 400 cubes, resulting in 20 * (400) = 8,000 cubes.\n\nIn the fourth stage, the process is applied once more to each of the 8,000 cubes, resulting in 20 * (8,000) = 160,000 cubes.\n\nSo, the total number of cubes in the 4th stage of construction of the Menger sponge is 160,000."
