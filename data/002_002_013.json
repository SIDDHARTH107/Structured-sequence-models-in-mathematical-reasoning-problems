    "message_2": "Given the radius r = 5 cm, we can find the volume V of the sphere using the formula V = 4/3πr³.\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)³\nV = (4/3) * π * (125 cm³)\nV = 1.3333... * π * 125 cm³\nV ≈ 523.5988 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately 523.60 cm³ (rounded to two decimal places)."
