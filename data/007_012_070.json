    "message_2": "We will test the smallest positive integers greater than 1 to find the one that satisfies the given condition.\n\nLet x = 2:\n(2 - 1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n2 is divisible by 2.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies the condition is x = 2, which is a prime number."
