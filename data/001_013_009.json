    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x-1) + 3 = √(x+4), we will first isolate one of the square roots. Let's isolate the square root on the left side of the equation:\n\n√(2x-1) = √(x+4) - 3\n\nNow, we will square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(√(2x-1))^2 = (√(x+4) - 3)^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x - 1 = (x+4) - 6√(x+4) + 9\n\nNow, let's move all the terms to one side of the equation:\n\n2x - 1 - x - 9 = -6√(x+4)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx - 10 = -6√(x+4)\n\nNow, we will isolate the square root term by dividing both sides by -6:\n\n(x - 10) / -6 = √(x+4)\n\nNow, we will square both sides of the equation again to eliminate the square root:\n\n((x - 10) / -6)^2 = (x+4)^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(x^2 - 20x + 100) / 36 = x^2 + 8x + 16\n\nNow, we will clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 36:\n\nx^2 - 20x + 100 = 36x^2 + 288x + 576\n\nNow, let's move all the terms to one side of the equation:\n\n0 = 35x^2 + 308x + 476\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 35, b = 308, and c = 476. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-308 ± √(308^2 - 4(35)(476))) / (2(35))\n\nx = (-308 ± √(95024 - 66800)) / 70\n\nx = (-308 ± √(28224)) / 70\n\nx = (-308 ± 168) / 70\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-308 + 168) / 70 = -140 / 70 = -2\n\nx = (-308 - 168) / 70 = -476 / 70 = -6.8\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation:\n\nFor x = -2:\n\n√(2(-2) - 1) + 3 = √((-2) + 4) => √(-5) + 3 = √(2)\n\nThis is not a valid solution, as the square root of a negative number is not a real number.\n\nFor x = -6.8:\n\n√(2(-6.8) - 1) + 3 = √((-6.8) + 4) => √(-14.6) + 3 = √(-2.8)\n\nThis is also not a valid solution, as the square root of a negative number is not a real number.\n\nTherefore, there are no real solutions for the given equation."
