    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ centered at $z=0$ that converges in the annulus $1<|z|<2$, we can use partial fraction decomposition. We can write $f(z)$ as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z}{(z-1)(z-2)} = \\frac{A}{z-1} + \\frac{B}{z-2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(z-1)(z-2)$, we get:\n\n$$z = A(z-2) + B(z-1)$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $A$ and $B$ by plugging in values of $z$ that make one of the terms on the right-hand side equal to zero. For example, if $z=1$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(1-2) \\Rightarrow A = 1$$\n\nSimilarly, if $z=2$, we get:\n\n$$2 = B(2-1) \\Rightarrow B = 2$$\n\nSo, we can rewrite $f(z)$ as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-1} + \\frac{2}{z-2}$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term. Since we want the series to converge in the annulus $1<|z|<2$, we can rewrite the first term as:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z-1} = -\\frac{1}{1-z} = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (z^n)$$\n\nFor the second term, we can rewrite it as:\n\n$$\\frac{2}{z-2} = \\frac{2}{z(1-\\frac{1}{2}z)} = \\frac{2}{z}\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{2}z} = \\frac{2}{z}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}z\\right)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^{1-n}z^n$$\n\nAdding the two series together, we get the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} z^n + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^{1-n}z^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (2^{1-n} - 1)z^n$$\n\nThis series converges in the annulus $1<|z|<2$, and the radius of convergence is given by the distances from the center $z=0$ to the singularities at $z=1$ and $z=2$, which are $1$ and $2$, respectively."
