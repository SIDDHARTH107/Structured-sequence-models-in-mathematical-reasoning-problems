    "message_2": "In symplectic geometry, the symplectic area of an ellipse is given by the formula:\n\nSymplectic Area = π * a * b\n\nwhere a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, respectively. In this case, a = 2 and b = 3.\n\nSo, the symplectic area of the ellipse is:\n\nSymplectic Area = π * 2 * 3 = 6π\n\nTherefore, the symplectic area of the ellipse is 6π square units."
