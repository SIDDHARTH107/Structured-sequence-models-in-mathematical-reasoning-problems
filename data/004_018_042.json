The derivative of 5x^3 with respect to x: \n   (3) * 5x^(3-1) = 15x^2\n\n2. The derivative of 2x^2 with respect to x: \n   (2) * 2x^(2-1) = 4x\n\n3. The derivative of -3x with respect to x: \n   (-1) * -3x^(1-1) = -3\n\n4. The derivative of a constant (-7) with respect to x is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^2 + 4x - 3"
