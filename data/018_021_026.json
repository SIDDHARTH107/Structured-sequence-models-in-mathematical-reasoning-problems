A ∪ B: The union of A and B, i.e., all elements in A or B.\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets (A - B) Δ (B ∩ A):\n\n(A - B) Δ (B ∩ A) = {1} Δ {2, 3}\nThis means we take elements that are in either {1} or {2, 3}, but not in both. So, we get:\n(A - B) Δ (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of the sets (A Δ B) ∩ (A ∪ B):\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A ∪ B) = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4}\nThis means we take elements that are common to both {1, 4} and {1, 2, 3, 4}. So, we get:\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A ∪ B) = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets we found:\n\n(A - B) Δ (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3}\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A ∪ B) = {1, 4}\n\nSince the two sets are not equal, we can conclude that:\n\n(A - B) Δ (B ∩ A) ≠ (A Δ B) ∩ (A ∪ B)"
