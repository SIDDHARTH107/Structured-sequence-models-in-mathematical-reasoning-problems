    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the curve, we first need to find a birational transformation that simplifies the equation. Let's consider the transformation $(x, y) \\mapsto (u, v)$, where $x = u + v$ and $y = u - v$. Then, we have:\n\n$$u = \\frac{x + y}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v = \\frac{x - y}{2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the given equation:\n\n$$(u - v)^3 + (u + v)^3 - 3(u - v)(u + v) = 0$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$2u^3 - 6u^2v + 2v^3 = 0$$\n\nDividing by 2, we obtain:\n\n$$u^3 - 3u^2v + v^3 = 0$$\n\nNow, let's make a substitution $w = u^2$, then $u = \\sqrt{w}$. We have:\n\n$$w\\sqrt{w} - 3wv + v^3 = 0$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$$w(v^2 - 3v\\sqrt{w} + w) = 0$$\n\nThis equation represents a union of two curves: $w = 0$ and $v^2 - 3v\\sqrt{w} + w = 0$. The first curve corresponds to the line $u = 0$, which is not a part of the original curve. Therefore, we are interested in the second curve:\n\n$$v^2 - 3v\\sqrt{w} + w = 0$$\n\nThis is the minimal model of the given curve."
