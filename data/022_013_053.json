    "message_2": "To find the value of f'(2), we first need to find the derivative of f(z) with respect to z. \n\nf(z) = z^2 - 2z + 1\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to z, we get:\n\nf'(z) = 2z - 2\n\nNow, we can find the value of f'(2) by plugging in z = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nNow, let's determine whether z = 2 is a zero, a pole, or neither for the function f(z).\n\nA zero of a function is a point where the function evaluates to 0. Let's check if f(2) = 0:\n\nf(2) = (2)^2 - 2(2) + 1 = 4 - 4 + 1 = 1\n\nSince f(2) â‰  0, z = 2 is not a zero of the function.\n\nA pole of a function is a point where the function goes to infinity. Since f(z) is a polynomial function, it does not have any poles.\n\nTherefore, z = 2 is neither a zero nor a pole for the function f(z)."
