    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg of length 7 centimeters and a hypotenuse of 11 centimeters. What is the length of the other leg using the Pythagorean Theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the other leg \"b\". We can set up the equation:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse. We are given that a = 7 cm and c = 11 cm, so we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n7^2 + b^2 = 11^2\n\n49 + b^2 = 121\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 121 - 49\nb^2 = 72\n\nTo find the length of the other leg, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √72\n\nb ≈ 8.49 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is approximately 8.49 centimeters."
