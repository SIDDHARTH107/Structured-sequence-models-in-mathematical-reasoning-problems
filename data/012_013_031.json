    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we need to consider the possible structures of the graph. Since the graph has 6 vertices, the maximum number of edges it can have without being a complete graph is 15 (i.e., a complete graph K_6 has 15 edges). \n\nSince G has 9 edges, it is not a complete graph. However, we can still use the chromatic polynomial formula for a complete graph and then subtract the chromatic polynomials of the subgraphs that are missing in G. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for a graph G with k colors can be found using the following recursive formula:\n\nP(G, k) = k * (k-1)^(n-1) - Σ P(H, k),\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices in G, H is a subgraph of G, and the summation is over all subgraphs H that are missing in G.\n\nFor our graph G with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we can start with the chromatic polynomial of a complete graph K_6:\n\nP(K_6, k) = k * (k-1)^5.\n\nNow we need to consider the subgraphs that are missing in G. Since G has 9 edges, it is missing 6 edges (15 - 9 = 6) from the complete graph K_6. There are several possible configurations of G, but without more information about the specific structure of G, we cannot determine the exact chromatic polynomial.\n\nIn general, the chromatic polynomial of G will be:\n\nP(G, k) = k * (k-1)^5 - Σ P(H, k),\n\nwhere the summation is over all subgraphs H that are missing in G. The exact chromatic polynomial depends on the specific structure of G, which is not provided in the problem statement."
