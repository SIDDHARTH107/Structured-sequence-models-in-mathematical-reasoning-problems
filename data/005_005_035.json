    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs, and it is known from historical data that 2% of the bulbs are defective. If a sample of 1000 bulbs is selected at random from this factory’s production, what is the probability that the sample will contain less than 20 defective bulbs?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective bulbs in the sample\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the sample size (in this case, 1000 bulbs)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs (we want to find the probability of having less than 20 defective bulbs)\n- p is the probability of a bulb being defective (2% or 0.02)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a bulb not being defective (98% or 0.98)\n\nWe want to find the probability of having less than 20 defective bulbs, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to k = 19:\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ [C(1000, k) * (0.02)^k * (0.98)^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can calculate the individual probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.0000 (for k=0) + 0.0001 (for k=1) + ... + 0.0573 (for k=19)\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.8571\n\nSo, the probability that the sample will contain less than 20 defective bulbs is approximately 85.71%."
