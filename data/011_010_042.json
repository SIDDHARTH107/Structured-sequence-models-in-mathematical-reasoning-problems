    "message_2": "The nth Catalan number can be found using the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nTo find the 10th Catalan number, we can plug in n = 10:\n\nC(10) = (1/(10+1)) * (20! / (10! * 10!))\n\nC(10) = (1/11) * (2432902008176640000 / (3628800 * 3628800))\n\nC(10) = (1/11) * (2432902008176640000 / 13168189440000)\n\nC(10) = 16796\n\nSo, the 10th Catalan number is 16,796."
