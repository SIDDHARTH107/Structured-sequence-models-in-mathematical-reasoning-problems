    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 16, we first need to find the total number of groups of order 16 and then subtract the number of abelian groups of order 16.\n\nThe total number of groups of order 16 can be found using the formula for the number of groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer. In this case, p = 2 and n = 4, so the order is 16.\n\nThe formula for the number of groups of order p^n is given by:\n\nNumber of groups = (p^(n^2) - p^(n(n-1)/2)) / (p^n - p^(n-1))\n\nPlugging in the values for p and n, we get:\n\nNumber of groups = (2^(16) - 2^(6)) / (2^4 - 2^3) = (65536 - 64) / (16 - 8) = 65672 / 8 = 8209\n\nNow, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 16. The number of abelian groups of order p^n is given by the partition function P(n). In this case, P(4) = 5, so there are 5 abelian groups of order 16.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-abelian groups of order 16 is:\n\nNumber of non-abelian groups = Total number of groups - Number of abelian groups = 8209 - 5 = 8204\n\nHowever, this result is incorrect. The formula used above is not valid for finding the number of groups of order p^n. The correct approach is to use the Sylow theorems and consider the possible structures of groups of order 16.\n\nThere are 14 groups of order 16 in total, and 5 of them are abelian. To find the number of non-abelian groups, we subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups:\n\nNumber of non-abelian groups = Total number of groups - Number of abelian groups = 14 - 5 = 9\n\nNow, let's show that every non-abelian group of order 16 is isomorphic to the same group.\n\nThere are two non-abelian groups of order 16 up to isomorphism: the dihedral group D_8 and the quaternion group Q_16.\n\n1. Dihedral group D_8: This group has 8 elements of order 2 and one element of order 4. It is generated by two elements, a rotation r and a reflection s, with the relations r^8 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^(-1)s.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q_16: This group has 8 elements of order 4 and one element of order 2. It is generated by two elements, i and j, with the relations i^4 = j^4 = 1 and ij = j^(-1)i.\n\nEvery non-abelian group of order 16 must have an element of order 8 or an element of order 4. If it has an element of order 8, then it is isomorphic to D_8. If it has an element of order 4, then it is isomorphic to Q_16.\n\nTherefore, every non-abelian group of order 16 is isomorphic to either D_8 or Q_16."
