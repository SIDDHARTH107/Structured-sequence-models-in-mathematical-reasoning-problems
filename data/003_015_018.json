    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the given trigonometric function, we need to analyze the equation:\n\ny = 3cos(2x + π/3)\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a trigonometric function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine or sine function. In this case, the coefficient of the cosine function is 3. Therefore, the amplitude is:\n\nAmplitude = |3| = 3\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a trigonometric function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. For a cosine or sine function, the period is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nwhere B is the coefficient of the variable x in the argument of the cosine or sine function. In this case, B = 2. Therefore, the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the given function is 3, and the period is π."
