    "message_2": "To find the period-3 orbit of the given nonlinear system, we will use the Poincaré map. The Poincaré map is a technique used to study the behavior of dynamical systems by analyzing the intersection points of trajectories with a certain surface, called the Poincaré section.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the system in polar coordinates:\nx = r*cos(θ)\ny = r*sin(θ)\n\nThen, the system becomes:\nr' = -r*cos(θ) + r^2*sin^2(θ)\nθ' = -r^2*cos^2(θ) + sin(θ)/cos(θ)\n\nNow, we need to find a suitable Poincaré section. A common choice is to take a section along the radial direction, i.e., when θ = constant. We can choose θ = 0 for simplicity.\n\nOn the Poincaré section, we have:\nr' = -r + r^2\nθ' = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the fixed points of the Poincaré map. These are the points where r' = 0. Solving for r, we get:\n-r + r^2 = 0\nr(r - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two fixed points: r = 0 and r = 1.\n\nTo find the period-3 orbit, we need to find the points on the Poincaré section that return to the same point after three iterations of the map. In other words, we need to find the points (r, θ) such that:\nP^3(r, θ) = (r, θ)\n\nApplying the Poincaré map three times, we get:\nP^3(r, θ) = P(P(P(r, θ)))\n\nSince θ' = 0, we have θ = constant, and we can focus on finding the period-3 orbit in the r-coordinate. We need to find r such that:\nP^3(r) = r\n\nApplying the Poincaré map three times to the r-coordinate, we get:\nr1 = -r + r^2\nr2 = -r1 + r1^2\nr3 = -r2 + r2^2\n\nWe need to find r such that r3 = r. This is a complicated nonlinear equation, and it is difficult to find an analytical solution. However, we can use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method, to find the roots of the equation r3 - r = 0.\n\nUsing a numerical method, we can find the period-3 orbit of the system. Note that this is an approximate solution, and the actual period-3 orbit might be slightly different due to numerical errors. However, this method gives us a good approximation of the period-3 orbit of the given nonlinear system."
