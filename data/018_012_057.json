Since B contains single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty. So, (A × B) ∩ B = ∅.\n\nNext, let's compute A ∩ B. The intersection of A and B is the set of elements that are common to both A and B. So, A ∩ B = {2}.\n\nNow, let's compute (A ∩ B) × B. Since A ∩ B = {2}, we have (A ∩ B) × B = {(2, 2), (2, 3)}.\n\nSo, the sets for the first part are (A × B) ∩ B = ∅ and (A ∩ B) × B = {(2, 2), (2, 3)}.\n\n2. We have already computed A × B. Now, let's compute B × A, which is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, B × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}.\n\nNow, let's compute (A × B) ∩ (B × A). The intersection of these two sets is the set of ordered pairs that are common to both A × B and B × A. So, (A × B) ∩ (B × A) = {(2, 2)}.\n\nNext, let's compute (A ∩ B) × (B ∩ A). Since A ∩ B = {2}, we have (A ∩ B) × (B ∩ A) = {(2, 2)}.\n\nSo, the sets for the second part are (A × B) ∩ (B × A) = {(2, 2)} and (A ∩ B) × (B ∩ A) = {(2, 2)}."
