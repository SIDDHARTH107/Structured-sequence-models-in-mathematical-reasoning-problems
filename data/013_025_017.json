    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem on Traveler's Dilemma:\n\nSuppose two travelers are caught carrying identical valuable vases in their carry-on luggage at the airport. They are told that the vases will be confiscated, and that they must each write down a number between 1 and 100 representing the value of the vase. If both write down the same number, that number will be taken as its value. If the two numbers are different, the lower number will be taken as the value and the higher number will be fined half the difference between the two numbers. For example, if one person writes down 75 and the other writes down 85, the vase will be valued at 75, and the person who wrote down 85 will be fined 5 (half of the difference between 85 and 75). \n\nAssuming that both travelers are rational and know the rules of the game, what number should they write down?",
    "message_2": "Both travelers should write down the number 1.\n\nHere's the reasoning: If one traveler thinks of writing down 100, they would realize that the other traveler might write down 99 to avoid the fine and get a higher value. So, the first traveler might consider writing down 98 instead. However, this logic can be applied iteratively, with each traveler trying to outsmart the other by writing a lower number. Eventually, they would both reach the conclusion that writing down the lowest possible number, which is 1, is the best strategy to avoid any fines and ensure they get some value for the vase. This is a result of the backward induction process in game theory."
