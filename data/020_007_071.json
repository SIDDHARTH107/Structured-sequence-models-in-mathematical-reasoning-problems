    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways to award the medals, we can use the concept of permutations since the order of the medals matters (gold, silver, and bronze are distinct).\n\nThere are 15 participants, so there are 15 choices for the gold medalist. Once the gold medalist is chosen, there are 14 remaining participants to choose from for the silver medalist. Finally, after the gold and silver medalists are chosen, there are 13 remaining participants to choose from for the bronze medalist.\n\nUsing the multiplication principle, the total number of ways to pick the medalists is:\n\n15 (choices for gold) × 14 (choices for silver) × 13 (choices for bronze) = 2730 ways."
