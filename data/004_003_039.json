    "message_1": "A cable of length 20 meters is to be cut into two pieces. One piece will be used to hang a sign with one end attached to a building and the other end attached to a post that is 5 meters from the building. The other piece will be used to hang a sign with one end attached to the same building and the other end attached to a post that is 10 meters from the building. \n\nWhat should be the lengths of the two pieces so that the total area of the two signs is maximized? (Round your answers to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the cable used for the first sign (5 meters from the building) and y be the length of the cable used for the second sign (10 meters from the building). We know that x + y = 20.\n\nThe area of the first sign can be represented as a right triangle with base 5 meters and height h1. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 = 5^2 + h1^2\nh1^2 = x^2 - 5^2\nh1 = sqrt(x^2 - 25)\n\nSimilarly, the area of the second sign can be represented as a right triangle with base 10 meters and height h2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\ny^2 = 10^2 + h2^2\nh2^2 = y^2 - 10^2\nh2 = sqrt(y^2 - 100)\n\nThe total area of the two signs is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:\n\nA_total = (1/2) * 5 * h1 + (1/2) * 10 * h2\nA_total = (1/2) * 5 * sqrt(x^2 - 25) + (1/2) * 10 * sqrt(y^2 - 100)\n\nSince x + y = 20, we can substitute y = 20 - x:\n\nA_total = (1/2) * 5 * sqrt(x^2 - 25) + (1/2) * 10 * sqrt((20 - x)^2 - 100)\n\nTo maximize the total area, we can use calculus. First, we find the derivative of A_total with respect to x:\n\ndA_total/dx = (5/2) * (1/2) * (2x) / sqrt(x^2 - 25) - (10/2) * (1/2) * (2(20 - x)) / sqrt((20 - x)^2 - 100)\n\nSimplifying:\n\ndA_total/dx = (5x) / sqrt(x^2 - 25) - 10(20 - x) / sqrt((20 - x)^2 - 100)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n(5x) / sqrt(x^2 - 25) - 10(20 - x) / sqrt((20 - x)^2 - 100) = 0\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods to find the approximate value of x. Using a numerical solver, we find that x ≈ 12.73 meters.\n\nNow we can find the length of the other piece, y:\n\ny = 20 - x ≈ 20 - 12.73 ≈ 7.27 meters\n\nTherefore, the lengths of the two pieces should be approximately 12.73 meters and 7.27 meters to maximize the total area of the two signs."
