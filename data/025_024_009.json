Let \\(p=(1,0)\\) and \\(q=(0,1)\\) be the two fixed points of \\(T\\), and let \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) be the line bundle on \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}\\) associated with the character \\(T\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}^{*}\\) given by \\((t_1,t_2)\\mapsto t_1t_2\\). Compute the degree of the restriction of \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) to the quotient \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T\\), and also compute the Hilbert polynomial of this line bundle.",
    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the restriction of \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) to the quotient \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T\\), we first need to understand the quotient space \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T\\). Since the action of \\(T\\) on \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}\\) is given by \\(t\\cdot(x,y)=(tx,ty)\\), the quotient space can be described as the set of orbits of this action. \n\nThe fixed points \\(p=(1,0)\\) and \\(q=(0,1)\\) correspond to the orbits \\(\\{p\\}\\) and \\(\\{q\\}\\), respectively. All other points in \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}\\) have non-trivial orbits under the action of \\(T\\). We can parameterize these orbits by the coordinates \\((x,y)\\) with \\(x\\neq 0\\) and \\(y\\neq 0\\). Then, the quotient space \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T\\) can be identified with the set \\(\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{A}^{2}\\ |\\ x\\neq 0, y\\neq 0\\}\\) together with the two fixed points \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of the restriction of \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) to \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T\\). The degree of a line bundle is the Euler characteristic of the associated sheaf. In this case, the sheaf associated with \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) is the structure sheaf \\(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T}\\). Since \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T\\) is an affine variety, the Euler characteristic of \\(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T}\\) is 1. Therefore, the degree of the restriction of \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) to \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T\\) is 1.\n\nNext, we compute the Hilbert polynomial of the line bundle \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\). The Hilbert polynomial is a polynomial that describes the growth of the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle as we tensor it with powers of a fixed ample line bundle. In this case, we can take the ample line bundle to be \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) itself. Then, the Hilbert polynomial is given by the formula:\n\n\\(P(n) = \\chi(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)^{\\otimes n})\\),\n\nwhere \\(\\chi\\) denotes the Euler characteristic.\n\nSince \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) is an ample line bundle on the affine variety \\(\\mathbb{A}^{2}/T\\), its Euler characteristic is constant and equal to the degree of the line bundle, which we computed to be 1. Therefore, the Hilbert polynomial of \\(\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\) is the constant polynomial:\n\n\\(P(n) = 1\\)."
