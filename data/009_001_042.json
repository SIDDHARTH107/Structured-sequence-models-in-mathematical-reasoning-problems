    "message_1": "A population of rabbits starts with 100 members and grows at a rate proportional to its size. After one year, the population has doubled. Find the differential equation that models this situation and use it to determine the number of rabbits after 5 years.",
    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t (in years). Since the growth rate is proportional to its size, we can write the differential equation as:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere k is the proportionality constant.\n\nGiven that the population doubles after one year, we have:\n\nP(1) = 2P(0)\n\nSince P(0) = 100, we have:\n\nP(1) = 2 * 100 = 200\n\nNow, we need to solve the differential equation dP/dt = kP. This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its general solution is given by:\n\nP(t) = P(0) * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P(0) is the initial population and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nUsing the given information, we can find the value of k:\n\n200 = 100 * e^(k * 1)\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\n2 = e^k\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = ln(e^k)\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we get:\n\nln(2) = k\n\nNow we have the value of k, and we can write the equation for P(t):\n\nP(t) = 100 * e^(ln(2) * t)\n\nTo find the number of rabbits after 5 years, we need to find P(5):\n\nP(5) = 100 * e^(ln(2) * 5)\n\nP(5) ≈ 100 * e^(3.4657)\n\nP(5) ≈ 100 * 31.999\n\nP(5) ≈ 3199.9\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a rabbit, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nP(5) ≈ 3200\n\nSo, after 5 years, there will be approximately 3200 rabbits in the population."
