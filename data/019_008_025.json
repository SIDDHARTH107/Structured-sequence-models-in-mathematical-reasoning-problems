The quality function also provides a degree of membership to each apple, indicating how ripe it is compared to other apples in the store.\n\nSuppose that a store has 200 apples. The quality function for each apple is as follows:\n\n- 10 apples have a quality of 0.3\n- 40 apples have a quality of 0.5\n- 100 apples have a quality of 0.8\n- 50 apples have a quality of 0.9\n\nCalculate the average degree of ripeness for all the apples in the store using fuzzy logic.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the average degree of ripeness for all the apples in the store using fuzzy logic, we will first find the total ripeness and then divide it by the total number of apples.\n\nTotal ripeness = (10 apples * 0.3) + (40 apples * 0.5) + (100 apples * 0.8) + (50 apples * 0.9)\nTotal ripeness = (3) + (20) + (80) + (45)\nTotal ripeness = 148\n\nNow, we will divide the total ripeness by the total number of apples (200) to find the average degree of ripeness.\n\nAverage degree of ripeness = Total ripeness / Total number of apples\nAverage degree of ripeness = 148 / 200\nAverage degree of ripeness â‰ˆ 0.74\n\nSo, the average degree of ripeness for all the apples in the store using fuzzy logic is approximately 0.74 or 74%."
