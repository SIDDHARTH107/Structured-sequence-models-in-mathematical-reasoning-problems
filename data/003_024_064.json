    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector AB onto vector AC, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of AB onto AC = (AB · AC) / ||AC|| * AC\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of AB and AC:\n\nAB · AC = (6 * 3) + (8 * 4) = 18 + 32 = 50\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector AC:\n\n||AC|| = √(3^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, we can find the projection of AB onto AC:\n\nProjection of AB onto AC = (50 / 5) * AC = 10 * AC = (10 * 3, 10 * 4) = (30, 40)\n\nSo, the projection of vector AB onto vector AC is (30, 40)."
