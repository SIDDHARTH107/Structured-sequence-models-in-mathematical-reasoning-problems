    "message_2": "Let's first analyze the given information about f(z).\n\n1. f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z=0. This means that f(z) can be written as f(z) = g(z)/(z^2), where g(z) is a holomorphic function and g(0) ≠ 0.\n\n2. f(z) has a simple pole at z=1. This means that f(z) can be written as f(z) = h(z)/(z-1), where h(z) is a holomorphic function and h(1) ≠ 0.\n\n3. f(z) has a removable singularity at z=2. This means that f(z) can be extended to a holomorphic function in a neighborhood of z=2 by defining f(2) = lim(z->2) f(z).\n\n4. f(z) is holomorphic for |z|>2 and satisfies the inequality |f(z)| ≤ 1 for all z ∈ C.\n\nNow, let's find the residues of f(z) at z=0 and z=1.\n\nResidue at z=0:\nSince f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z=0, we can find the residue by taking the first derivative of g(z)/(z^2) and evaluating it at z=0.\n\nRes[f(z), 0] = (d/dz) [g(z)/(z^2)](0)\n\nSince g(z) is holomorphic and g(0) ≠ 0, g(z) can be written as a power series g(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + ... with a_0 ≠ 0. Then,\n\ng'(z) = a_1 + 2a_2z + 3a_3z^2 + ...\n\nSo, Res[f(z), 0] = g'(0) = a_1.\n\nResidue at z=1:\nSince f(z) has a simple pole at z=1, we can find the residue by multiplying f(z) by (z-1) and evaluating it at z=1.\n\nRes[f(z), 1] = [(z-1) * h(z)/(z-1)](1) = h(1)\n\nNow, we use the information that |f(z)| ≤ 1 for all z ∈ C. Since f(z) is holomorphic for |z|>2, it is bounded by 1 in this region. By the Maximum Modulus Principle, f(z) must be constant in this region. Let's denote this constant as c.\n\nf(z) = c for |z|>2\n\nSince f(z) has a removable singularity at z=2, we can extend f(z) to be holomorphic at z=2 by defining f(2) = c.\n\nNow, we have enough information to find the residues at z=0 and z=1.\n\nRes[f(z), 0] = a_1 = g'(0)\n\nRes[f(z), 1] = h(1)\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic for |z|>2 and satisfies the inequality |f(z)| ≤ 1 for all z ∈ C, we can conclude that the residues of f(z) at z=0 and z=1 are:\n\nRes[f(z), 0] = g'(0) = a_1\nRes[f(z), 1] = h(1)"
