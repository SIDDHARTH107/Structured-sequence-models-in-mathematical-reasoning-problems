    "message_2": "To find the distance between two points on the surface of a hyperbolic sphere (also known as a hyperboloid), we need to use the hyperbolic distance formula. However, the information provided is not sufficient to directly apply the hyperbolic distance formula. The straight line distance between the two points (10) is not enough information to determine the distance on the surface of the hyperboloid.\n\nThe hyperbolic distance formula is given by:\n\nd = R * arcosh(1 + (d_straight^2 / (2 * R^2)))\n\nwhere d is the hyperbolic distance, R is the radius of the hyperboloid (5 in this case), arcosh is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, and d_straight is the straight line distance between the two points (10 in this case).\n\nHowever, without knowing the angle between the two points or some other information about their positions on the hyperboloid, we cannot calculate the hyperbolic distance between them."
