    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(x) + sin(x) = 1, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(x) = cos(π/2 - x)\n\nNow, substitute this identity into the original equation:\n\ncos(x) + cos(π/2 - x) = 1\n\nLet y = x - π/2. Then, x = y + π/2. Substitute this into the equation:\n\ncos(y + π/2) + cos(y) = 1\n\nNow, use the angle sum formula for cosine:\n\ncos(y)cos(π/2) - sin(y)sin(π/2) + cos(y) = 1\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\n-sin(y) + cos(y) = 1\n\nNow, square both sides of the equation and use the Pythagorean identity:\n\n(-sin(y) + cos(y))^2 = 1^2\nsin^2(y) - 2sin(y)cos(y) + cos^2(y) = 1\n\nUsing the identity sin^2(y) + cos^2(y) = 1, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1 - 2sin(y)cos(y) = 1\n\nNow, subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-2sin(y)cos(y) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\nsin(y)cos(y) = 0\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\n1) sin(y) = 0\n2) cos(y) = 0\n\nCase 1: sin(y) = 0\ny = nπ, where n is an integer.\n\nSince y = x - π/2, we have:\n\nx - π/2 = nπ\nx = nπ + π/2\n\nFor 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, we have two solutions: x = π/2 and x = 3π/2.\n\nCase 2: cos(y) = 0\ny = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer.\n\nSince y = x - π/2, we have:\n\nx - π/2 = (2n + 1)π/2\nx = (2n + 1)π/2 + π/2\n\nFor 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation cos(x) + sin(x) = 1 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = π/2 and x = 3π/2."
