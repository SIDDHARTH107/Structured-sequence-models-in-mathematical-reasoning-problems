    "message_1": "A store owner knows that the demand equation for her product is Q = 120 - 2P, where Q is the quantity sold and P is the price charged in dollars. The cost equation is C = 30Q + 500, where C is the cost of producing Q number of products. What price should the store owner charge in order to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we first need to find the profit equation. Profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost. The revenue equation is R = PQ, where R is the revenue, P is the price, and Q is the quantity sold.\n\nWe are given the demand equation Q = 120 - 2P, so we can substitute this into the revenue equation to get R = P(120 - 2P) = 120P - 2P^2.\n\nNow, we have the cost equation C = 30Q + 500. We can substitute the demand equation for Q again to get C = 30(120 - 2P) + 500 = 3600 - 60P + 500 = 4100 - 60P.\n\nNow we can find the profit equation by subtracting the cost equation from the revenue equation: Profit = Revenue - Cost = (120P - 2P^2) - (4100 - 60P) = 120P - 2P^2 - 4100 + 60P = -2P^2 + 180P - 4100.\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the vertex of this quadratic equation. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by the formula x = -b / 2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, a = -2 and b = 180, so x = -180 / (2 * -2) = 180 / 4 = 45.\n\nSo, the store owner should charge $45 per product to maximize profit."
