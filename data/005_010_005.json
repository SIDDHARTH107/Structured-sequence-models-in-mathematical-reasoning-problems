A sample of 25 light bulbs is taken and tested for their lifespan. What is the probability that the average lifespan of this sample is between 790 and 810 hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the average lifespan of the sample is between 790 and 810 hours, we will use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 800 hours, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 50 hours. The sample size (n) is 25 light bulbs. We want to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is between 790 and 810 hours.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 50 / √25\nSE = 50 / 5\nSE = 10\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the interval (790 and 810 hours). The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower bound (790 hours):\n\nz1 = (790 - 800) / 10\nz1 = -10 / 10\nz1 = -1\n\nFor the upper bound (810 hours):\n\nz2 = (810 - 800) / 10\nz2 = 10 / 10\nz2 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is between -1 and 1. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(-1 < z < 1) = P(z < 1) - P(z < -1)\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator:\n\nP(z < 1) ≈ 0.8413\nP(z < -1) ≈ 0.1587\n\nP(-1 < z < 1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587\nP(-1 < z < 1) ≈ 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that the average lifespan of the sample of 25 light bulbs is between 790 and 810 hours is approximately 68.26%."
