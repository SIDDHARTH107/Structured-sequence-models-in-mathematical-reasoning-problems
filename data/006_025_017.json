    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting two heads and one tail in any order, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 3 coin flips) and k is the number of items we want to choose (in this case, 2 heads).\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!)\nC(3, 2) = 6 / (2 * 1)\nC(3, 2) = 3\n\nThere are 3 possible ways to get two heads and one tail in any order: HHT, HTH, and THH.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes when flipping three coins. Each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), so for three coins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes (3) by the total number of possible outcomes (8):\n\nProbability = 3/8 = 0.375\n\nSo, the probability of getting two heads and one tail in any order during the magician's performance is 0.375 or 37.5%."
