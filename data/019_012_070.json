    "message_2": "You are correct. Paraconsistent logic is a branch of logic that deals with reasoning patterns that do not lead to contradictions, and it does not involve numerical calculations or formulas. As a mathematician, I can help you with other mathematical problems or concepts. Please feel free to ask any other mathematical question or provide a problem to solve."
