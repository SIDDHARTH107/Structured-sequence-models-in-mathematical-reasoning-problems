    "message_2": "First, let's prove that f induces an isomorphism between the fundamental group of X at x0 and the subgroup of the fundamental group consisting of elements that are their own inverse.\n\nSince f is a continuous map from X to X, it induces a homomorphism f_*: π_1(X, x0) → π_1(X, f(x0)) between the fundamental groups of X at x0 and f(x0). Since f^2(x0) = x0, we have that (f^2)_* = f_* ∘ f_* is the identity map on π_1(X, x0). Thus, f_* is an injective homomorphism.\n\nNow, let's show that the image of f_* is the subgroup of elements that are their own inverse. Let [α] be an element in the image of f_*. Then, there exists [β] in π_1(X, x0) such that f_*([β]) = [α]. Since (f^2)_* is the identity map, we have that [α] = f_*([β]) = (f^2)_*([β]) = f_* ∘ f_*([β]) = f_*([β] * [β]). Thus, [α] * [α] = [α] * f_*([β]) = f_*([β] * [β]) = [id], where [id] is the identity element in π_1(X, x0). This shows that [α] is its own inverse.\n\nConversely, let [γ] be an element in π_1(X, x0) such that [γ] * [γ] = [id]. Then, [γ] = f_*([γ]) * f_*([γ]) = f_*([γ] * [γ]) = f_*([id]) = [id]. Thus, [γ] is in the image of f_*.\n\nTherefore, f_* induces an isomorphism between the fundamental group of X at x0 and the subgroup of the fundamental group consisting of elements that are their own inverse.\n\nNow, let's compute the first and second homotopy groups of the wedge sum of two circles, which is the space obtained by taking two circles and gluing them together at a point.\n\nLet A and B be two circles, and let x0 be the point at which they are glued together. The wedge sum of A and B, denoted by A ∨ B, is the space obtained by identifying x0 in both circles. The fundamental group of A ∨ B at x0 is the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B at x0, which is π_1(A ∨ B, x0) = π_1(A, x0) * π_1(B, x0) = Z * Z, where Z denotes the group of integers.\n\nFor the second homotopy group, since A and B are both 1-dimensional spaces, all higher homotopy groups, including the second homotopy group, are trivial. Therefore, π_2(A ∨ B, x0) = 0."
