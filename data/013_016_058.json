    "message_1": "Suppose you are the manager of a company considering two different projects. The first project has a 70% chance of earning a profit of $50,000 and a 30% chance of earning nothing. The second project has a 40% chance of earning a profit of $100,000 and a 60% chance of losing $20,000. However, your employees are paid based on the project they work on and will receive $5,000 for working on the first project and $10,000 for working on the second project. If you want to maximize the total profit for your company, which project should you choose and why?",
    "message_2": "To determine which project to choose, we need to calculate the expected profit for each project, taking into account the employee payments.\n\nFor the first project:\nExpected profit = (0.7 * $50,000) + (0.3 * $0) - $5,000\nExpected profit = ($35,000) - $5,000\nExpected profit = $30,000\n\nFor the second project:\nExpected profit = (0.4 * $100,000) - (0.6 * $20,000) - $10,000\nExpected profit = $40,000 - $12,000 - $10,000\nExpected profit = $18,000\n\nBased on the expected profits, the first project has a higher expected profit of $30,000 compared to the second project's expected profit of $18,000. Therefore, to maximize the total profit for your company, you should choose the first project."
