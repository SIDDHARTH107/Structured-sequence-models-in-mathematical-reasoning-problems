    "message_2": "In type theory, we describe the types of inputs and outputs of a function. In this case, the function f takes an integer as input (denoted as x) and outputs an integer as well (since adding 3 to an integer results in another integer). Therefore, the type of the function f can be represented as:\n\nf : Integer -> Integer"
