    "message_2": "Since f(z) is an entire function, it has a power series representation:\n\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + ...\n\nGiven that |f(z)| ≤ 1 for all complex numbers z, we can apply Liouville's theorem, which states that a bounded entire function must be constant. However, we know that f(0) = 0 and f(i) = 1, which means f(z) cannot be constant. This contradiction implies that the condition |f(z)| ≤ 1 cannot hold for all z.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement is incorrect, and we cannot find the value of f(2i) based on the given information."
