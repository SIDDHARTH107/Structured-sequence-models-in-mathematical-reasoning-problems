    "message_2": "To find the maximum element in an unsorted array of n integers using a linear search algorithm, we need to iterate through each element in the array and compare it with the current maximum value. Here are the steps to arrive at the time complexity:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `max_value` to store the maximum value found so far. Set it to the first element of the array.\n\n2. Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element (n-1 elements in total).\n\n3. For each element, compare it with the current `max_value`. If the current element is greater than `max_value`, update `max_value` with the current element.\n\n4. After iterating through all the elements, `max_value` will hold the maximum element in the array.\n\nNow, let's analyze the time complexity:\n\n- Step 1 takes constant time, O(1).\n- Step 2 involves iterating through n-1 elements, which takes O(n) time.\n- Step 3 is performed for each element in the array, taking constant time O(1) for each comparison and update operation.\n- Step 4 takes constant time, O(1).\n\nThe overall time complexity is dominated by the iteration in Step 2, which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity for finding the maximum element in an unsorted array of n integers using a linear search algorithm is O(n)."
