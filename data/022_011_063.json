    "message_2": "To determine the order and type of the pole at z = -3 for the function f(z) = (z^3 + 2z^2 + 5z + 10) / ((z + 2)(z + 3)^2), we first need to analyze the denominator of the function.\n\nThe denominator is given by (z + 2)(z + 3)^2. We can see that there is a factor of (z + 3)^2, which means that the function has a pole at z = -3. The exponent of this factor is 2, which indicates that the pole is of order 2.\n\nNow, let's find the type of the pole. A pole of order 2 is called a double pole. Therefore, the pole at z = -3 is a double pole.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) = (z^3 + 2z^2 + 5z + 10) / ((z + 2)(z + 3)^2) has a double pole of order 2 at z = -3."
