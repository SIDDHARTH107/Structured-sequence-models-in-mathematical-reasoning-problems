    "message_2": "Yes, according to Goldbach's Conjecture, we can express 126 as the sum of two prime numbers. Let's find the prime numbers:\n\nOne possible pair of prime numbers that add up to 126 is 7 and 119. However, 119 is not a prime number as it can be factored into 7 and 17. So, let's try another pair.\n\nAnother possible pair is 11 and 115. However, 115 is not a prime number as it can be factored into 5 and 23. Let's try another pair.\n\nThe next possible pair is 17 and 109. Both 17 and 109 are prime numbers, as they cannot be factored into smaller whole numbers other than 1 and themselves.\n\nSo, the prime numbers that add up to 126 are 17 and 109."
