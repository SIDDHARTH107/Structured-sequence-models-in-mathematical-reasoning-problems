    "message_1": "Suppose that a city has three neighborhoods: A,B, and C. It is observed that 40% of the population in neighborhood A also goes to neighborhood B frequently, 30% goes to neighborhood C frequently, and the remaining 30% stays in neighborhood A. Similarly, 20% of the population in neighborhood B frequents neighborhood A, 50% goes to C frequently, and the remaining 30% stays in neighborhood B. Finally, 25% of the population in neighborhood C goes to neighborhood A frequently, 10% goes to neighborhood B frequently, and the remaining 65% stays in neighborhood C. \n\nSuppose that today 40% of the population is in neighborhood A, 30% is in neighborhood B, and 30% is in neighborhood C. What will be the percentage of population in each neighborhood after a week?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of the population in each neighborhood after a week, we can use the concept of Markov chains. We will represent the transition probabilities between neighborhoods as a matrix and multiply it by the initial population distribution vector. Then, we will raise the transition matrix to the power of 7 (for 7 days) and multiply it by the initial population distribution vector.\n\nLet's represent the transition probabilities as a matrix P:\n\nP = | 0.3  0.2  0.25 |\n      | 0.4  0.3  0.1   |\n      | 0.3  0.5  0.65 |\n\nAnd the initial population distribution vector as V:\n\nV = | 0.4 |\n      | 0.3 |\n      | 0.3 |\n\nNow, we need to raise the matrix P to the power of 7. We can do this using matrix exponentiation:\n\nP^7 = | 0.3333  0.3333  0.3333 |\n          | 0.3333  0.3333  0.3333 |\n          | 0.3333  0.3333  0.3333 |\n\nNow, we multiply P^7 by the initial population distribution vector V:\n\nP^7 * V = | 0.3333 * 0.4 + 0.3333 * 0.3 + 0.3333 * 0.3 |\n                | 0.3333 * 0.4 + 0.3333 * 0.3 + 0.3333 * 0.3 |\n                | 0.3333 * 0.4 + 0.3333 * 0.3 + 0.3333 * 0.3 |\n\nP^7 * V = | 0.3333 |\n                | 0.3333 |\n                | 0.3333 |\n\nSo after a week, the percentage of the population in each neighborhood will be approximately 33.33% in neighborhood A, 33.33% in neighborhood B, and 33.33% in neighborhood C."
