    "message_1": "An airline has five flights leaving every day from New York to Los Angeles. Each flight has a capacity of 150 passengers. There are currently 600 reservations for the first flight, 480 for the second, 400 for the third, 200 for the fourth, and 350 for the fifth. The airline charges different fares for different days and flights, ranging from $150 to $400 per seat. The company wants to maximize their revenue while making sure that every passenger has a seat on a flight. What is the maximum revenue that the airline can generate?",
    "message_2": "To maximize revenue, the airline should charge the highest fare ($400) for the flights with the highest demand and the lowest fare ($150) for the flights with the lowest demand. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of passengers:\n600 (first flight) + 480 (second flight) + 400 (third flight) + 200 (fourth flight) + 350 (fifth flight) = 2030 passengers\n\nThe total capacity of all five flights is:\n5 flights * 150 passengers = 750 passengers\n\nSince there are more passengers than available seats, the airline will need to distribute the passengers across the flights to ensure everyone has a seat. \n\nWe can distribute the passengers as follows:\n1. First flight: 150 passengers (highest demand) - charge $400 per seat\n2. Second flight: 150 passengers (second highest demand) - charge $400 per seat\n3. Third flight: 150 passengers (third highest demand) - charge $400 per seat\n4. Fourth flight: 150 passengers (fourth highest demand) - charge $150 per seat\n5. Fifth flight: 150 passengers (fifth highest demand) - charge $150 per seat\n\nNow, let's calculate the revenue for each flight:\n1. First flight: 150 passengers * $400 = $60,000\n2. Second flight: 150 passengers * $400 = $60,000\n3. Third flight: 150 passengers * $400 = $60,000\n4. Fourth flight: 150 passengers * $150 = $22,500\n5. Fifth flight: 150 passengers * $150 = $22,500\n\nThe maximum revenue the airline can generate is:\n$60,000 (first flight) + $60,000 (second flight) + $60,000 (third flight) + $22,500 (fourth flight) + $22,500 (fifth flight) = $225,000"
