    "message_1": "Consider the following differential equation:\n\ny'' + 5y' + 6y = 2cos(2t)\n\nwhere y(t) is a function of time.\n\nUsing the Fourier transform, calculate the solution y(t) for the given differential equation, assuming the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function y(t) is given by:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[y(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t), and ω is the angular frequency. \n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides of the given differential equation, we have:\n\nFT[y''(t) + 5y'(t) + 6y(t)] = FT[2cos(2t)]\n\nNow, we can use the linearity property of the Fourier transform to separate the terms:\n\nFT[y''(t)] + 5FT[y'(t)] + 6FT[y(t)] = FT[2cos(2t)]\n\nNext, we need to find the Fourier transforms of y''(t), y'(t), and y(t). We can use the differentiation property of the Fourier transform, which states that:\n\nFT[d^n(y(t))/dt^n] = (iω)^n * Y(ω)\n\nApplying this property, we get:\n\nFT[y''(t)] = (iω)^2 * Y(ω) = -ω^2 * Y(ω)\nFT[y'(t)] = iω * Y(ω)\nFT[y(t)] = Y(ω)\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into our equation:\n\n-ω^2 * Y(ω) + 5iω * Y(ω) + 6Y(ω) = FT[2cos(2t)]\n\nThe Fourier transform of 2cos(2t) can be found using the following formula:\n\nFT[cos(at)] = π[δ(ω - a) + δ(ω + a)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function. In our case, a = 2, so:\n\nFT[2cos(2t)] = 2π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our equation:\n\n-ω^2 * Y(ω) + 5iω * Y(ω) + 6Y(ω) = 2π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNext, we can factor out Y(ω) from the left side:\n\nY(ω) * (-ω^2 + 5iω + 6) = 2π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = 2π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] / (-ω^2 + 5iω + 6)\n\nTo find y(t), we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω):\n\ny(t) = FT^(-1)[Y(ω)]\n\ny(t) = FT^(-1)[2π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] / (-ω^2 + 5iω + 6)]\n\nHowever, solving this inverse Fourier transform analytically is quite challenging. Instead, we can use the Laplace transform method or the method of undetermined coefficients to find the solution y(t) for the given differential equation with the specified initial conditions."
