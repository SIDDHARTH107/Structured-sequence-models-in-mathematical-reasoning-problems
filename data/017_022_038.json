    "message_1": "In how many ways can a group of order 60 be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will consider each case separately and then sum up the results.\n\nCase 1: Cyclic group C60\nThere is only one cyclic group of order 60, which is generated by an element of order 60. So, there is only 1 way for a group of order 60 to be isomorphic to C60.\n\nCase 2: Alternating group A5 × C2\nThe alternating group A5 has order 5!/2 = 60, and C2 has order 2. The direct product A5 × C2 has order 60 × 2 = 120. However, we are looking for a group of order 60, so this case is not applicable.\n\nCase 3: Non-abelian groups of order 60\nThere are 32 non-abelian groups of order 60 up to isomorphism. Each of these groups is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups, so there are 32 ways for a group of order 60 to be isomorphic to one of these non-abelian groups.\n\nSumming up the results from all cases, we have:\n\n1 (C60) + 0 (A5 × C2) + 32 (non-abelian groups) = 33 ways\n\nSo, there are 33 ways for a group of order 60 to be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
