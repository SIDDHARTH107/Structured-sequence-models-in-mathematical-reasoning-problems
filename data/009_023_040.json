    "message_2": "To solve the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the given initial condition, we can use the inverse scattering transform method. However, for this specific initial condition, we can recognize that it is a soliton solution. The general form of a soliton solution for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sqrt{2} \\eta \\ sech(\\eta(x - x_0 - 2\\eta^2 t)) e^{i(\\eta^2(x - x_0) - \\eta^4 t)}$$\n\nHere, $\\eta$ is the amplitude of the soliton, $x_0$ is the initial position, and $t$ is the time. Comparing this general form with the given initial condition, we can see that $\\eta = 1$ and $x_0 = 0$. Therefore, the soliton solution for the given initial condition is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sqrt{2} \\ sech(x - 2t) e^{i(x - t)}$$\n\nNow, we can find the value of $u(0,1)$ by plugging in $x = 0$ and $t = 1$:\n\n$$u(0,1) = \\sqrt{2} \\ sech(-2) e^{i(-1)}$$\n\nWe can calculate the value of $sech(-2)$:\n\n$$sech(-2) = \\frac{2}{e^{-2} + e^2} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{e^2} + e^2} = \\frac{2e^2}{1 + e^4}$$\n\nThus, the value of $u(0,1)$ is:\n\n$$u(0,1) = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{2e^2}{1 + e^4} \\cdot e^{-i}$$\n\nThis is the complex value of the wave function $u(0,1)$ at the given point."
