    "message_1": "Let A={1,2} and B={3,4}. Calculate the Cartesian product A x B and B x A. Show that A x B is not equal to B x A, therefore proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartesian product A x B, we form ordered pairs with the elements of A as the first component and the elements of B as the second component. Similarly, for B x A, we form ordered pairs with the elements of B as the first component and the elements of A as the second component.\n\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets A x B and B x A. We can see that the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. For example, (1,3) is in A x B but not in B x A, and (3,1) is in B x A but not in A x B.\n\nSince A x B and B x A have different ordered pairs, we can conclude that A x B is not equal to B x A. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
