    "message_2": "To find the angles of the triangle using the Law of Cosines, we can use the following formula:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c. We can use this formula to find one angle, and then use the Law of Sines to find the other two angles.\n\nLet's find angle C first:\n\na = 12 cm\nb = 15 cm\nc = 18 cm\n\ncos(C) = (12^2 + 15^2 - 18^2) / (2 * 12 * 15)\ncos(C) = (144 + 225 - 324) / (360)\ncos(C) = 45 / 360\ncos(C) = 1/8\n\nNow, we can find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine of 1/8:\n\nC = arccos(1/8) ≈ 82.82°\n\nNow that we have angle C, we can use the Law of Sines to find angles A and B:\n\nsin(A) / a = sin(B) / b = sin(C) / c\n\nLet's find angle A:\n\nsin(A) / 12 = sin(82.82°) / 18\n\nsin(A) = (12 * sin(82.82°)) / 18\nsin(A) ≈ 0.6436\n\nA = arcsin(0.6436) ≈ 39.81°\n\nNow, let's find angle B:\n\nsin(B) / 15 = sin(82.82°) / 18\n\nsin(B) = (15 * sin(82.82°)) / 18\nsin(B) ≈ 0.8045\n\nB = arcsin(0.8045) ≈ 53.37°\n\nSo, the measures of the angles in the triangle are approximately:\n\nA ≈ 39.81°\nB ≈ 53.37°\nC ≈ 82.82°"
