    "message_1": "A parallel plate capacitor with plate separation distance equal to 0.02 m and plate area equal to 0.01 m² has a charge density of 2 x 10⁻⁸ C/m². Find the electric field inside the capacitor and the potential difference between the plates. (Assume the capacitor is filled with a vacuum and ignore edge effects)",
    "message_2": "To find the electric field inside the capacitor, we can use the formula:\n\nE = σ / ε₀\n\nwhere E is the electric field, σ is the charge density, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity constant (approximately 8.85 x 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²).\n\nGiven the charge density σ = 2 x 10⁻⁸ C/m², we can calculate the electric field:\n\nE = (2 x 10⁻⁸ C/m²) / (8.85 x 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²) ≈ 2.26 x 10⁵ N/C\n\nNow, to find the potential difference between the plates, we can use the formula:\n\nV = E * d\n\nwhere V is the potential difference and d is the plate separation distance.\n\nGiven the electric field E = 2.26 x 10⁵ N/C and the plate separation distance d = 0.02 m, we can calculate the potential difference:\n\nV = (2.26 x 10⁵ N/C) * (0.02 m) ≈ 4520 V\n\nSo, the electric field inside the capacitor is approximately 2.26 x 10⁵ N/C, and the potential difference between the plates is approximately 4520 V."
