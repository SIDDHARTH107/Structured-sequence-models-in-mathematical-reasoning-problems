    "message_1": "Alice wants to send the message \"MATH\" to Bob using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\". What is the encrypted message that Alice should send to Bob? (Assume the message is in uppercase and the Playfair cipher uses a 5x5 matrix with the letters of the keyword \"CRYPTO\" in the beginning followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet.)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to create the 5x5 matrix using the keyword \"CRYPTO\" and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, as it is combined with I in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe matrix will look like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nO A B D E\nF G H I K\nL M N S U\nV W X Z Q\n\nNow, we need to encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same, add an 'X' between them (not applicable in this case).\n2. If the letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).\n3. If the letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter below it (wrapping around to the top of the column if necessary).\n4. If the letters are in different rows and columns, replace each with the letter in its row and the column of the other letter.\n\nSo, let's encrypt the message \"MATH\":\n\nM is in row 4, column 2, and A is in row 2, column 2. They are in the same column, so we replace M with L (row 5, column 2) and A with O (row 3, column 2). The first pair of encrypted letters is LO.\n\nT is in row 1, column 5, and H is in row 3, column 3. They are in different rows and columns, so we replace T with the letter in its row and H's column (E, row 1, column 3) and H with the letter in its row and T's column (I, row 3, column 5). The second pair of encrypted letters is EI.\n\nSo, the encrypted message Alice should send to Bob is \"LOEI\"."
