    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base length of 10 cm, a base width of 8 cm, and a height of 15 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangle can be found by multiplying the base length by the base width:\n\nBase Area = 10 cm * 8 cm = 80 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 80 cm² * 15 cm = (1/3) * 1200 cm³ = 400 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 400 cubic centimeters."
