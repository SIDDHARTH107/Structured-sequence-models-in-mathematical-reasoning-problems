    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n3x^2 - 12x = 3x(x - 4)\n\nDenominator:\n6x - 24 = 6(x - 4)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(3x(x - 4))/(6(x - 4))\n\nSince (x - 4) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(3x)/(6)\n\nNow, we can simplify further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\n(3x/3)/(6/3)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx/2\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\nx/2"
