    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2, we need to first find the derivative of the given function with respect to x.\n\nThe given function is y = x^2 - 2x + 3.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2 - 2x + 3)/dx\ndy/dx = 2x - 2 (using the power rule for differentiation)\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point where x = 2. Substitute x = 2 into the derivative:\n\ndy/dx = 2(2) - 2\ndy/dx = 4 - 2\ndy/dx = 2\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 2."
