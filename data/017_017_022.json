    "message_2": "A cyclic group of order 30 is generated by an element of order 30. The number of cyclic subgroups of a cyclic group is equal to the number of divisors of the order of the group.\n\nThe prime factorization of 30 is 2 * 3 * 5. To find the total number of divisors, we add 1 to each of the exponents of the prime factors and then multiply the results.\n\n(1 + 1) * (1 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 cyclic subgroups in a group of order 30 that is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30."
