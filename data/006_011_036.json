    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, accidents) in n trials (workers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of workers, which is 300)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of accidents)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a worker having an accident, which is 0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a worker not having an accident, which is 0.95)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 15 workers having an accident, so we need to calculate the probability of 15 or more accidents. To do this, we can find the probability of 0 to 14 accidents and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X >= 15) = 1 - P(X < 15) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 14)]\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 14, and then sum them up:\n\nP(X < 15) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 14\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities for each value of k and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X < 15) ≈ 0.8783\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 15 workers having an accident:\n\nP(X >= 15) = 1 - P(X < 15) = 1 - 0.8783 ≈ 0.1217\n\nSo, the probability of at least 15 workers having an accident in a week is approximately 0.1217, or 12.17%."
