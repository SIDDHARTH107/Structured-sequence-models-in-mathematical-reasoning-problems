    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, width of 5 cm, and height of 6 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length × width): 8 cm × 5 cm = 40 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 40 cm² × 2 = 80 cm².\n\n2. The area of the second pair of opposite faces (length × height): 8 cm × 6 cm = 48 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 48 cm² × 2 = 96 cm².\n\n3. The area of the third pair of opposite faces (width × height): 5 cm × 6 cm = 30 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 30 cm² × 2 = 60 cm².\n\nNow, add the areas of all the faces together: 80 cm² + 96 cm² + 60 cm² = 236 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 236 cm²."
