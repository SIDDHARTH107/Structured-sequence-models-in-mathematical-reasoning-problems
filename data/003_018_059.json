    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 2sin(3x) + 5cos(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, we have two terms, so we'll find the derivative of each term separately and then add them together.\n\n1) For the first term, 2sin(3x), the outer function is 2sin(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. \n\nThe derivative of the outer function with respect to u is:\nd(2sin(u))/du = 2cos(u)\n\nThe derivative of the inner function with respect to x is:\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\nd(2sin(3x))/dx = (2cos(u))(3) = 6cos(3x)\n\n2) For the second term, 5cos(2x), the outer function is 5cos(v) and the inner function is v = 2x.\n\nThe derivative of the outer function with respect to v is:\nd(5cos(v))/dv = -5sin(v)\n\nThe derivative of the inner function with respect to x is:\nd(2x)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\nd(5cos(2x))/dx = (-5sin(v))(2) = -10sin(2x)\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of both terms together to get the derivative of the entire function:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(3x) - 10sin(2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/6. We'll plug in x = π/6 into the derivative:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6cos(3(π/6)) - 10sin(2(π/6))\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6cos(π/2) - 10sin(π/3)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/3) = √3/2, so:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6(0) - 10(√3/2)\ndy/dx(π/6) = -5√3\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 2sin(3x) + 5cos(2x) at x = π/6 is -5√3."
