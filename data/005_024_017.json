    "message_2": "To calculate the z-score, we use the formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the individual's income, μ is the mean income, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = $70,000, μ = $50,000, and σ = $10,000.\n\nz = ($70,000 - $50,000) / $10,000\nz = $20,000 / $10,000\nz = 2\n\nThe z-score of an individual earning $70,000 in that city is 2."
