    "message_1": "Suppose that 10% of all cars passing a certain intersection within a given hour are red. What is the probability that at least 2 out of the next 15 cars passing through the intersection within the next 30 minutes will be red?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (red cars) in n trials (cars passing through the intersection), nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, p is the probability of success (10% or 0.1), and 1-p is the probability of failure (90% or 0.9).\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 2 red cars out of 15, which means we need to find the probability of 2, 3, 4, ..., 15 red cars and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of 0 or 1 red car and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = (15C0) * (0.1^0) * (0.9^15)\nP(X = 1) = (15C1) * (0.1^1) * (0.9^14)\n\nNow, we calculate these probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.9^15 ≈ 0.20589113\nP(X = 1) = 15 * 0.1 * 0.9^14 ≈ 0.38742049\n\nNow, we find the probability of at least 2 red cars:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) ≈ 1 - 0.20589113 - 0.38742049 ≈ 0.40668838\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 out of the next 15 cars passing through the intersection within the next 30 minutes will be red is approximately 0.4067 or 40.67%."
