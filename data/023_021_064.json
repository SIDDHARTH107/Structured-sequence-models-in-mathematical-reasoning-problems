    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given equation, we first need to rewrite the sine function in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nsin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix)) / (2i)\n\nSo, the given equation becomes:\n\nf(t) = 10 * (e^(i2π(100,000)t) - e^(-i2π(100,000)t)) / (2i)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nSubstitute f(t) into the integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[10 * (e^(i2π(100,000)t) - e^(-i2π(100,000)t)) / (2i) * e^(-iωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = (10/2i) * [∫(e^(i2π(100,000)t) * e^(-iωt) dt) - ∫(e^(-i2π(100,000)t) * e^(-iωt) dt)] (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nLet's evaluate the two integrals separately:\n\n∫(e^(i2π(100,000)t) * e^(-iωt) dt) = ∫(e^(-i(ω - 2π(100,000))t) dt) = δ(ω - 2π(100,000)) / (-i)\n\n∫(e^(-i2π(100,000)t) * e^(-iωt) dt) = ∫(e^(-i(ω + 2π(100,000))t) dt) = δ(ω + 2π(100,000)) / i\n\nNow, substitute these results back into the expression for F(ω):\n\nF(ω) = (10/2i) * [δ(ω - 2π(100,000)) / (-i) - δ(ω + 2π(100,000)) / i]\n\nF(ω) = -5 * [δ(ω - 2π(100,000)) - δ(ω + 2π(100,000))]\n\nNow, we want to find the amplitude and phase angle of the signal at the frequency of 100 kHz. Since the frequency is 100 kHz, we have ω = 2π(100,000). So, we can evaluate F(ω) at this frequency:\n\nF(2π(100,000)) = -5 * [δ(0) - δ(4π(100,000))] = -5 * [1 - 0] = -5\n\nThe amplitude of the signal at the frequency of 100 kHz is 5, and the phase angle is 180 degrees (or π radians) since the Fourier transform is negative."
