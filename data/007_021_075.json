    "message_2": "To find the smallest factor of 957 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a function f(x) and an initial value x_0. A common choice for f(x) is f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod N), where N is the number we want to factor (957 in this case). We will start with x_0 = 2.\n\n2. Generate a sequence of numbers using the function f(x) and the previous number in the sequence. We will generate two sequences, one with single iterations (tortoise) and the other with double iterations (hare).\n\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between the two sequences and the number N (957).\n\n4. If the GCD is 1, continue generating the sequences. If the GCD is greater than 1 and less than N, we have found a non-trivial factor of N.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod 957), x_0 = 2\n\n2. Generate the sequences:\n   Tortoise: 2, 5, 26, 677, 429, 566, 929, 362, 37, 1386, 807, 710, 875, 710, ...\n   Hare: 26, 429, 362, 1386, 875, ...\n\n3. Calculate the GCD:\n   GCD(|2 - 26|, 957) = 1\n   GCD(|5 - 429|, 957) = 1\n   GCD(|26 - 362|, 957) = 1\n   GCD(|677 - 1386|, 957) = 3\n\n4. The GCD is greater than 1 and less than 957, so we have found a non-trivial factor of 957.\n\nThe smallest factor of 957 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 3."
