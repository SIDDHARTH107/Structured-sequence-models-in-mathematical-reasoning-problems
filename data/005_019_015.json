    "message_1": "Bob likes to exercise regularly. He has three options: running, swimming or cycling. He makes his decision based on the activity he did the previous day. If he ran yesterday, there is a 40% chance he runs today, 20% chance he swims, and 40% chance he cycles. If he swam yesterday, there is a 60% chance he swims today, 10% chance he runs, and 30% chance he cycles. Finally, if he cycled yesterday, there is a 50% chance he cycles today, 30% chance he runs, and 20% chance he swims. If he ran yesterday, what is the probability he swims today?",
    "message_2": "Since Bob ran yesterday, we can directly use the given probabilities for today's activities based on running yesterday. The probability that he swims today is 20%."
