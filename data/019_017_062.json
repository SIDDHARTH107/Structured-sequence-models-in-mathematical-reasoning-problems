    "message_2": "In the first-order language of arithmetic, we can use the Peano axioms to describe the natural numbers. To show that the set of natural numbers is infinite, we can construct the following sentence:\n\n∀x ∃y (S(x) = y)\n\nHere, S(x) represents the successor function, which maps a natural number to its immediate successor. This sentence states that for every natural number x, there exists a distinct natural number y that is the successor of x. Since there is always a successor for every natural number, this implies that the set of natural numbers is infinite."
