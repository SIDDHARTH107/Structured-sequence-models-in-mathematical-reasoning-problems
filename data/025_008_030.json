Find the genus of C.\n2. Compute the Hodge numbers h^{1,0} and h^{0,1} of C.\n\nNote: The genus of a curve is a measure of its \"number of holes\" and can be computed using the formula g = (d-1)(d-2)/2, where d is the degree of a canonical divisor. Hodge numbers are topological invariants that measure the dimensions of certain spaces of algebraic cycles on a variety.",
    "message_2": "1. To find the genus of C, we first need to find the degree of a canonical divisor. The given curve C is a plane curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^2(x+1)$. We can rewrite this equation in the homogeneous form as $Y^2Z = X^2(X+Z)$, where $x=X/Z$ and $y=Y/Z$. Now, we can see that the degree of the curve is 3, as the highest degree term is $X^3$.\n\nUsing the formula for the genus, we have:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2} = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$\n\nSo, the genus of C is 1.\n\n2. For a smooth projective curve of genus g, the Hodge numbers are given by:\n\n$h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = g$\n\nSince we found that the genus of C is 1, we have:\n\n$h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 1$\n\nThus, the Hodge numbers of C are both 1."
