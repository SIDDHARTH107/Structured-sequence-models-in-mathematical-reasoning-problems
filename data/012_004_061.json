    "message_1": "A telecommunications company has installed fiber optic cables to connect all their offices in a city. The company wants to determine the minimum cost for laying the cables using the minimum spanning tree algorithm. The cost of laying cables between each pair of offices is given in the following table:\n\n| Office | A | B | C | D | E |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A      | - | 4 | 3 | 9 | 21|\n| B      | 4 | - | 2 | 8 | 12|\n| C      | 3 | 2 | - | 10| 5 |\n| D      | 9 | 8 | 10| - | 6 |\n| E      | 21| 12| 5 | 6 | - |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost for laying the fiber optic cables to connect all the offices? Which paths should the company follow to connect all the offices?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost for laying the fiber optic cables, we will use the minimum spanning tree algorithm, specifically Kruskal's algorithm. First, we list all the edges in ascending order of their weights:\n\n1. B-C (2)\n2. C-A (3)\n3. C-E (5)\n4. D-E (6)\n5. A-B (4)\n6. B-D (8)\n7. C-D (10)\n8. A-D (9)\n9. A-E (21)\n10. B-E (12)\n\nNow, we will add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add B-C (2)\n2. Add C-A (3)\n3. Add C-E (5)\n4. Add D-E (6)\n\nAt this point, all the offices are connected, and adding any more edges would create a cycle. So, the minimum spanning tree consists of the edges B-C, C-A, C-E, and D-E.\n\nThe minimum cost for laying the fiber optic cables to connect all the offices is the sum of the weights of these edges: 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 16.\n\nThe company should follow the paths B-C, C-A, C-E, and D-E to connect all the offices with the minimum cost."
