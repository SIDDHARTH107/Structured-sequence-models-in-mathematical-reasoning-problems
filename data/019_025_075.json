    "message_2": "To find the total revenue for the second year, we first need to determine the original price per unit and then calculate the new price per unit after the 20% increase. Finally, we will multiply the new price per unit by the number of units sold in the second year.\n\n1. Find the original price per unit:\nTotal revenue in the first year = $75,000\nNumber of units sold in the first year = 5000\nPrice per unit in the first year = Total revenue / Number of units = $75,000 / 5000 = $15\n\n2. Calculate the new price per unit after the 20% increase:\nPercentage increase = 20%\nNew price per unit = Original price per unit * (1 + Percentage increase) = $15 * (1 + 0.20) = $15 * 1.20 = $18\n\n3. Find the total revenue for the second year:\nNumber of units sold in the second year = 6000\nTotal revenue in the second year = New price per unit * Number of units sold = $18 * 6000 = $108,000\n\nThe total revenue of the company for the second year was $108,000."
