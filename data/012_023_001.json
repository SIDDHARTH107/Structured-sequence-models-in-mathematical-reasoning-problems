The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph, where all vertices are directly connected to each other.",
    "message_2": "In this graph, we can see the following cliques (complete subgraphs):\n\n1. A-B (2 vertices)\n2. A-C (2 vertices)\n3. A-D (2 vertices)\n4. B-E (2 vertices)\n5. C-D (2 vertices)\n6. A-C-D (3 vertices)\n\nThe largest clique in this graph is A-C-D, which has 3 vertices. Therefore, the clique number of the graph is 3."
