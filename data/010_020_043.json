Let $A$ and $B$ be two points on $\\mathbb{T}^2$ such that the distance between them is equal to the length of the shortest path connecting them. Calculate the length of this shortest path.",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between two points on a torus, we can use the concept of geodesics. Geodesics are the shortest paths between two points on a curved surface, analogous to straight lines in Euclidean space.\n\nLet's consider the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$ as the surface of revolution of a circle of radius $r$ (in this case, $r=1$) around the $z$-axis at a distance $R$ from the axis. The parametric equations for the torus are given by:\n\n$$\nx = (R + r \\cos{v}) \\cos{u} \\\\\ny = (R + r \\cos{v}) \\sin{u} \\\\\nz = r \\sin{v}\n$$\n\nwhere $0 \\le u, v < 2\\pi$. The variables $u$ and $v$ are the angular parameters of the torus, with $u$ representing the angle around the $z$-axis and $v$ representing the angle around the circle being revolved.\n\nTo find the shortest path between points $A$ and $B$, we need to compute the geodesic distance between them. The geodesic distance can be found by integrating the arc length element $ds$ over the path connecting the two points. The arc length element on a parametric surface is given by:\n\n$$\nds^2 = E du^2 + 2F dudv + G dv^2\n$$\n\nwhere $E = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial u} \\right\\rangle$, $F = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial v} \\right\\rangle$, and $G = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial v} \\right\\rangle$ are the coefficients of the first fundamental form of the surface.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives and the coefficients, we get:\n\n$$\nE = (R + r \\cos{v})^2 \\\\\nF = 0 \\\\\nG = r^2\n$$\n\nThus, the arc length element becomes:\n\n$$\nds^2 = (R + r \\cos{v})^2 du^2 + r^2 dv^2\n$$\n\nThe shortest path between two points on a surface is given by the path that minimizes the integral of the arc length element. In general, finding this path requires solving a complicated set of differential equations. However, for the torus, we can find the maximum geodesic distance by considering the path that wraps around the torus in both the $u$ and $v$ directions.\n\nIn this case, the path corresponds to a \"diagonal\" across the torus, connecting opposite points on the surface. The length of this path can be found by integrating the arc length element over one full revolution in both the $u$ and $v$ directions:\n\n$$\nL = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{(R + r \\cos{v})^2 du^2 + r^2 dv^2}\n$$\n\nSince the integrand does not depend on $u$, we can integrate over $u$ first:\n\n$$\nL = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{(R + r \\cos{v})^2} du \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{r^2} dv\n$$\n\nEvaluating the integrals, we get:\n\n$$\nL = 2\\pi (R + r) \\cdot 2\\pi r\n$$\n\nFor our torus with $r = 1$ and $R = 1$, the maximum geodesic distance is:\n\n$$\nL = 2\\pi (1 + 1) \\cdot 2\\pi (1) = 8\\pi^2\n$$\n\nThus, the length of the shortest path connecting points $A$ and $B$ on the torus is $8\\pi^2$."
