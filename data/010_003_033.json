    "message_2": "To prove that X is not a connected topological space, we need to show that it can be written as the union of two disjoint, non-empty open sets.\n\nWe are given that there exist two disjoint, non-empty open subsets U and V such that their union equals X. This means that U ∩ V = ∅ and U ∪ V = X.\n\nNow, let's recall the definition of a connected topological space. A topological space X is said to be connected if there do not exist two disjoint, non-empty open sets U and V such that their union equals X.\n\nHowever, we already have two disjoint, non-empty open sets U and V whose union equals X. This directly contradicts the definition of a connected topological space.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that X is not a connected topological space."
