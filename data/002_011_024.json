    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg measuring 6 cm and the hypotenuse is 10 cm. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the other leg as \"a\". We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\na^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\n\na^2 + 36 = 100\n\nNow, we'll solve for a:\n\na^2 = 100 - 36\na^2 = 64\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\na = âˆš64\na = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is 8 cm."
