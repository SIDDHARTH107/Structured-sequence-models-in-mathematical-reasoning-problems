    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color its edges, meaning no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph, denoted by Δ(G). Since there are 10 edges and 7 vertices, the maximum degree cannot be more than 10/2 = 5 (as each edge contributes to the degree of 2 vertices). Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If Δ(G) = 5, then there must be a vertex connected to all other 6 vertices. In this case, the remaining edges would be 10 - 6 = 4, which means there must be at least one more vertex with a degree of 4. This is not possible, as it would require a total of 11 edges (6 + 4 + 1 for the remaining vertices), which is more than the given 10 edges.\n\n2. If Δ(G) = 4, then there can be at most two vertices with a degree of 4, as having three such vertices would require 12 edges (3 * 4), which is more than the given 10 edges. In this case, the remaining edges would be 10 - 2 * 4 = 2, which can be distributed among the other vertices. This is a valid configuration.\n\nSince Δ(G) = 4, we can use Vizing's theorem to find the chromatic index. Vizing's theorem states that for any graph G, Δ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1. In our case, this means that 4 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 5.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it's possible to properly color the edges with 4 colors. Since there are at most two vertices with a degree of 4, we can color their incident edges with 4 different colors. The remaining 2 edges can be colored without violating the proper coloring condition, as they are not adjacent to any of the already colored edges.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic index of this graph is χ'(G) = 4."
