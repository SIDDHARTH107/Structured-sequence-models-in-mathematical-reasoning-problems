We need to determine the geodesic that passes through the equator of the torus and is perpendicular to it at a point which is at a distance of 2 units from the circle of the torus. What is the length of this geodesic?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Clairaut's theorem, which states that for a geodesic on a surface of revolution, the product of the radial distance (ρ) and the sine of the angle (θ) between the geodesic and the equator is constant.\n\nLet's denote the major radius as R (3 units) and the minor radius as r (1 unit). The point where the geodesic is perpendicular to the equator is at a distance of 2 units from the circle of the torus. Let's call this point A.\n\nAt point A, the radial distance ρ_A is equal to the minor radius r (1 unit), and the angle θ_A between the geodesic and the equator is 90 degrees (since it's perpendicular). Therefore, sin(θ_A) = sin(90) = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the point where the geodesic intersects the equator again, which we'll call point B. At point B, the radial distance ρ_B is equal to the major radius R (3 units), and the angle θ_B between the geodesic and the equator is 0 degrees (since it's on the equator). Therefore, sin(θ_B) = sin(0) = 0.\n\nUsing Clairaut's theorem, we have:\n\nρ_A * sin(θ_A) = ρ_B * sin(θ_B)\n1 * 1 = 3 * 0\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, Clairaut's theorem holds true for this geodesic.\n\nNow, let's find the length of the geodesic. We can do this by finding the length of the arc traced by the geodesic on the surface of the torus. Since the geodesic is perpendicular to the equator at point A and intersects the equator at point B, it forms a semicircle on the surface of the torus.\n\nThe circumference of the circle formed by the minor radius is C = 2 * π * r = 2 * π * 1 = 2π. Since the geodesic forms a semicircle, its length is half of the circumference:\n\nLength of geodesic = (1/2) * 2π = π units.\n\nSo, the length of the geodesic is π units."
