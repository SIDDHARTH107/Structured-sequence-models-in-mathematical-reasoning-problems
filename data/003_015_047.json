    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given trigonometric function, we need to analyze its form. The function is given by:\n\nf(x) = 4 cos(2x + π/4)\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is:\n\nf(x) = A cos(Bx + C)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, we have A = 4, B = 2, and C = π/4.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is the maximum value the function can take. In our case, the amplitude is |4| = 4.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a cosine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |B|\n\nIn our case, B = 2, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |2| = 2π / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 4 cos(2x + π/4) is 4, and its period is π."
