    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for the math student to solve:\n\nA certain control system is modeled by the differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 3y'(t) + 2y(t) = u(t)\n\nwhere y(t) is the system output and u(t) is the input. Using the Fourier transform, determine the transfer function of the system and analyze its stability.\n\nAssume that the system input u(t) is the periodic square wave shown below with period T = 2π:\n\nu(t) = { 1, 0 ≤ t ≤ π\n      {-1, π < t ≤ 2π\n\nWhat is the system's transfer function and is the system stable or unstable?",
    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the system, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of y''(t), y'(t), and y(t) are respectively (-jω)^2Y(ω), -jωY(ω), and Y(ω), where Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t). The Fourier transform of u(t) is U(ω). So, the equation in the frequency domain becomes:\n\n(-jω)^2Y(ω) + 3(-jω)Y(ω) + 2Y(ω) = U(ω)\n\nNow, we can solve for the transfer function H(ω) = Y(ω)/U(ω):\n\nY(ω) = (U(ω)) / ((-jω)^2 + 3(-jω) + 2)\n\nY(ω) = (U(ω)) / (ω^2 - 3jω + 2)\n\nThe transfer function H(ω) is:\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω)/U(ω) = 1 / (ω^2 - 3jω + 2)\n\nTo analyze the stability of the system, we need to check the poles of the transfer function. The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator becomes zero:\n\nω^2 - 3jω + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in ω. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nω = (3j ± √((-3j)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / (2*1)\nω = (3j ± √(9 + 8)) / 2\nω = (3j ± √17) / 2\n\nThe poles are complex conjugates with positive imaginary parts. In general, a system is stable if all its poles have negative real parts. Since the real parts of these poles are zero, the system is marginally stable.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier series coefficients of the square wave input u(t):\n\nU_n = (1/π) * ∫[0, π] u(t) * e^(-jnω₀t) dt, where ω₀ = 2π/T = 1\n\nU_n = (1/π) * ∫[0, π] 1 * e^(-jnt) dt\nU_n = (1/π) * [-j(1/n) * e^(-jnt)] | from 0 to π\nU_n = (1/π) * [-j(1/n) * (e^(-jnπ) - 1)]\n\nFor n ≠ 0, U_n = (1/π) * [-j(1/n) * (cos(nπ) - 1 - jsin(nπ))]\nFor n = 0, U_0 = 1/2\n\nSince the system is marginally stable, it will not blow up or decay the input signal. However, it may exhibit sustained oscillations or other complex behaviors depending on the input. In this case, the input is a square wave, and the system will respond with oscillations at the harmonics of the square wave."
