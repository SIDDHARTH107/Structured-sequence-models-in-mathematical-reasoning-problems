    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel has a radius of 30 meters, and completes one revolution in 2 minutes. Find the maximum height of a passenger if the passenger gets onto the wheel at ground level. (Assume the center of the wheel is at ground level)",
    "message_2": "If the center of the Ferris wheel is at ground level, then the maximum height a passenger can reach is when they are at the top of the wheel. Since the radius of the wheel is 30 meters, the maximum height a passenger can reach is equal to the diameter of the wheel (twice the radius).\n\nMaximum height = 2 * radius = 2 * 30 meters = 60 meters.\n\nSo, the maximum height a passenger can reach is 60 meters."
