    "message_2": "First, let's note that the given variety is a curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. Since the degree of the polynomial $f(x,y,z)$ is 3, this curve is a cubic curve, also known as an elliptic curve. The cohomology groups of projective spaces are well-known, and in particular, we have $H^i(\\mathbb{P}^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$ for $i=0,2,4$ and $H^i(\\mathbb{P}^2) = 0$ for all other $i$.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection cohomology groups $IH^i(X)$. By definition, these groups are the cohomology groups of a certain sheaf on $X$, called the intersection cohomology sheaf. For a smooth projective variety, the intersection cohomology groups coincide with the usual cohomology groups. In our case, the curve $X$ is smooth, so we have $IH^i(X) = H^i(X)$ for all $i$.\n\nSince $X$ is a curve, its cohomology groups are concentrated in degrees 0, 1, and 2. In particular, we have $IH^6(X) = H^6(X) = 0$."
