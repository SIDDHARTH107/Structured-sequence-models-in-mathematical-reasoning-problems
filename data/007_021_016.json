    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding the smallest non-trivial factor of a composite number. Here's the algorithm applied to the composite number 969323:\n\n1. Choose a random starting point x and a function f(x) (usually f(x) = x^2 + 1).\n2. Iterate the function twice, once for x and once for f(x), and find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference and the composite number.\n3. If the GCD is not 1 or the composite number, it is a non-trivial factor. Otherwise, repeat steps 2 and 3.\n\nLet's start with x = 2 and f(x) = x^2 + 1:\n\n1. x = 2, f(x) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\n2. f(2) = 5, f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\n3. GCD(26 - 5, 969323) = GCD(21, 969323) = 1\n\nSince the GCD is 1, we need to continue iterating:\n\n4. f(5) = 26, f(26) = 26^2 + 1 = 677\n5. GCD(677 - 26, 969323) = GCD(651, 969323) = 1\n\nContinue iterating:\n\n6. f(26) = 677, f(677) = 677^2 + 1 = 458330\n7. GCD(458330 - 677, 969323) = GCD(457653, 969323) = 1\n\nContinue iterating:\n\n8. f(677) = 458330, f(458330) = 458330^2 + 1 â‰¡ 324170 (mod 969323)\n9. GCD(324170 - 458330, 969323) = GCD(-134160, 969323) = GCD(134160, 969323) = 7\n\nThe smallest non-trivial factor of 969323 is 7."
