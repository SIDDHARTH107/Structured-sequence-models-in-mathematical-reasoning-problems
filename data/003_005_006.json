    "message_2": "To find the value of A in degrees using the inverse function of sine, we use the arcsin (or sin^(-1)) function:\n\nA = arcsin(sin(A))\n\nA = arcsin(0.5)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose sine is 0.5. We know that the sine of 30 degrees (or π/6 radians) is 0.5:\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5\n\nTherefore, the value of A is:\n\nA = 30°"
