    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 96 are there, and can you provide an example of one such group?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to analyze the prime factorization of 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is based on the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. For a group of order p^a * q^b, the formula is k(p^a) * k(q^b), where k(x) represents the number of partitions of x.\n\nFor 2^5, there are 7 partitions: (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), and (1,1,1,1,1).\nFor 3^1, there are 2 partitions: (1) and (1,1).\n\nUsing the formula, we have 7 * 2 = 14 possible groups of order 96. However, this includes the abelian groups, so we need to subtract the number of abelian groups to find the number of non-abelian groups.\n\nThe number of abelian groups of order 96 is given by the product of the number of partitions of each exponent in the prime factorization, which is 7 * 2 = 14. However, we need to subtract 1 to account for the cyclic group of order 96, which is also abelian. So, there are 14 - 1 = 13 abelian groups of order 96.\n\nTherefore, there are 14 - 13 = 1 non-abelian group of order 96.\n\nAn example of a non-abelian group of order 96 is the semidirect product of Z_32 and Z_3, denoted as Z_32 ⋊ Z_3. In this group, Z_32 is a normal subgroup, and Z_3 acts on Z_32 by automorphisms. The group operation is defined as (a, b) * (c, d) = (a + b^c, b * d), where a, c are elements of Z_32, and b, d are elements of Z_3."
