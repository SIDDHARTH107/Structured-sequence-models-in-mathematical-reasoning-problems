    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology group H^3(C, Z), we first need to determine the topological properties of the curve C defined by the equation f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x^2.\n\nThe curve C is an algebraic curve, and it is a singular curve since the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y vanish at the origin (0, 0):\n\n∂f/∂x = -3x^2 - 2x = 0\n∂f/∂y = 2y = 0\n\nSince the curve C is singular, we can desingularize it by considering its normalization, which is a smooth curve. The normalization of C is a smooth curve that is topologically equivalent to C. In this case, the normalization of C is a smooth cubic curve, which is a genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve).\n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology groups of the smooth curve. For a smooth curve of genus g, the cohomology groups are given by:\n\nH^0(C, Z) = Z\nH^1(C, Z) = Z^(2g)\nH^2(C, Z) = Z\nH^k(C, Z) = 0 for k > 2\n\nSince the genus of the curve C is 1, we have:\n\nH^0(C, Z) = Z\nH^1(C, Z) = Z^2\nH^2(C, Z) = Z\nH^k(C, Z) = 0 for k > 2\n\nTherefore, the 3rd cohomology group H^3(C, Z) is trivial:\n\nH^3(C, Z) = 0"
