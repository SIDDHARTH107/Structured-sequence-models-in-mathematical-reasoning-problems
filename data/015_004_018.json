    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. The set is centered at the origin (0, 0) in the complex plane and has a diameter of 2 units.\n\nSince the Mandelbrot set is centered at the origin, the value of the complex number c at the center is also (0, 0). Therefore, the value of c for the center of the Mandelbrot set is 0 + 0i, or simply 0."
