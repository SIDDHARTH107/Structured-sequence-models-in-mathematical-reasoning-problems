    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field inside the solenoid, we can use Ampere's law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) passing through the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a solenoid, the magnetic field is uniform and parallel to the axis of the solenoid. Therefore, we can simplify Ampere's law for a solenoid as:\n\nB * l = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, l is the length of the solenoid, n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current.\n\nWe are given the number of turns per meter (n = 4000 turns/m) and the current (I = 2 A). The permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant value, approximately equal to 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀ * n * I) / l\n\nSince we are considering a unit length (1 meter) of the solenoid, we can set l = 1 m:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (4000 turns/m) * (2 A)\n\nB = 8π × 10^(-4) T\n\nB ≈ 0.008 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is approximately 0.008 T (tesla)."
