    "message_2": "To calculate the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable 2-manifold with genus g, we can use the given formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a torus, the genus is 1. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(1) = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of a torus is 0."
