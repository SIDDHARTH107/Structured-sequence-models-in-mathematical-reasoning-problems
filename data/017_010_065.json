    "message_2": "To prove that the given group G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10, we will first identify the structure of the non-abelian group of order 10 and then show that G has the same structure.\n\nThe non-abelian group of order 10 is the dihedral group D_5, which can be represented as the set of symmetries of a regular pentagon. D_5 has two generators, r and s, where r is a rotation by 72 degrees and s is a reflection. The relations between these generators are r^5 = s^2 = e (the identity element) and sr = r^(-1)s.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of G using the given Cayley table. We can see that the element 'a' has order 5 (a^5 = e) and the element 'b' has order 2 (b^2 = e). We will try to find an element in G that satisfies the relation similar to sr = r^(-1)s in D_5.\n\nConsider the product 'ba' in G, which is equal to 'i'. Now, let's compute the product 'abi' (which corresponds to sr^(-1)s in D_5). From the Cayley table, we have:\n\nabi = (ba)(ai) = i(j) = c\n\nNow, let's compute the inverse of 'a', which is a^4 (since a^5 = e). We have:\n\na^4 = c\n\nThis shows that the relation 'abi = a^(-1)' holds in G, similar to the relation sr = r^(-1)s in D_5.\n\nNow, we can define a mapping φ: G → D_5 as follows:\n\nφ(e) = e\nφ(a) = r\nφ(b) = s\nφ(a^i) = r^i\nφ(ba^i) = sr^i\n\nThis mapping is well-defined, as the relations between the elements in G match the relations between the corresponding elements in D_5. Furthermore, φ is a bijection, as it maps each element in G to a unique element in D_5 and vice versa.\n\nSince φ is a bijective homomorphism, G is isomorphic to D_5, which is the non-abelian group of order 10."
