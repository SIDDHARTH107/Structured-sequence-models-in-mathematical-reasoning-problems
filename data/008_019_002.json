    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method in this case.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n4x + 6yi = 14 + 8i\n\nNow we have:\n\n(1) 4x + 6yi = 14 + 8i\n(2) 4x - y + 6i = -2 + 5i\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (2): (4x + 6yi) - (4x - y + 6i) = (14 + 8i) - (-2 + 5i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n7yi + y = 16 + 3i\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\ny(7i + 1) = 16 + 3i\n\ny = (16 + 3i) / (7i + 1)\n\nTo get rid of the complex number in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (7i - 1):\n\ny = [(16 + 3i) * (7i - 1)] / [(7i + 1) * (7i - 1)]\n\ny = [(16 * 7i - 16) + (3i * 7i - 3i)] / [(7i)^2 - (1)^2]\n\ny = [(112i - 16) + (21i^2 - 3i)] / [49i^2 - 1]\n\nSince i^2 = -1:\n\ny = [(112i - 16) + (21(-1) - 3i)] / [49(-1) - 1]\n\ny = [(112i - 16) - 21 - 3i] / [-49 - 1]\n\ny = (95i - 37) / (-50)\n\ny = -37/(-50) + 95i/(-50)\n\ny = 37/50 - 19i/10\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of x. We will use equation (1):\n\n4x + 6yi = 14 + 8i\n\n4x + 6(37/50 - 19i/10)i = 14 + 8i\n\n4x + (222/50 - 114i/10) = 14 + 8i\n\n4x = 14 + 8i - 222/50 + 114i/10\n\n4x = (14 - 222/50) + (8i + 114i/10)\n\n4x = (-2/50) + (8i + 114i/10)\n\n4x = (-1/25) + (8i + 57i/5)\n\n4x = (-1/25) + (8i + 228i/25)\n\n4x = (-1/25) + (8i + 228i)/25\n\n4x = (-1 + 236i)/25\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = (-1 + 236i) / (25 * 4)\n\nx = (-1 + 236i) / 100\n\nx = -1/100 + 236i/100\n\nx = -1/100 + 59i/25\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -1/100 + 59i/25\ny = 37/50 - 19i/10"
