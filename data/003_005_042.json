    "message_2": "The arctan function, also known as the inverse tangent function, returns the angle whose tangent is the given value. In this case, we are asked to find the angle whose tangent is √3.\n\nRecall that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. We can use the special right triangles to find the angle whose tangent is √3.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nSince the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, we can see that the tangent of the 60-degree angle is:\n\ntan(60°) = (√3) / 1 = √3\n\nTherefore, the value of arctan(√3) is 60° or π/3 radians."
