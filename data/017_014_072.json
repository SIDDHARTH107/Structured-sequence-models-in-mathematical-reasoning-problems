    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to C20, D10, or a non-abelian group of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5. Thus, we will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility for n_2 is 1. This means that there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 4 in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted by n_5, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1. This means that there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5 in G.\n\nSince both P and Q are normal subgroups of G, their intersection is also a normal subgroup of G. However, since the orders of P and Q are coprime (4 and 5), their intersection must be the identity element of G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q.\n\nNow, P is a group of order 4, so it must be isomorphic to either C4 (the cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (the Klein four-group). Q is a group of order 5, which is prime, so it must be isomorphic to C5 (the cyclic group of order 5).\n\nIf P ≅ C4 and Q ≅ C5, then G ≅ C4 × C5. Since the orders of C4 and C5 are coprime, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20 by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nIf P ≅ V4 and Q ≅ C5, then G ≅ V4 × C5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, as D10 can be constructed as the semi-direct product of V4 and C5.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20 or the dihedral group D10. There is no non-abelian group of order 20 that is not isomorphic to D10, so G cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 20 other than D10."
