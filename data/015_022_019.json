    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a nonlinear delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = a * x(t - τ) / (1 + x(t - τ)^β) - x(t)\n\nwhere a, β, and τ are parameters. To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, one must analyze the stability of the system by linearizing the equation around its fixed points and then calculating the Lyapunov exponent.\n\nHowever, finding the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Mackey-Glass equation is not a trivial task and usually requires numerical methods, such as the Wolf algorithm or Rosenstein's method, to approximate the value.\n\nGiven the parameter values a = 0.2, β = 0.1, and τ = 17, it is not possible to provide an exact value for the maximum Lyapunov exponent without performing a numerical analysis. I recommend using a numerical method or software package to approximate the maximum Lyapunov exponent for this specific set of parameters."
