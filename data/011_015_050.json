    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of players required to ensure that there are at least 3 players on the same team or 3 players on different teams, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes (in this case, teams) and m > n pigeons (players), then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this case, we have 2 teams (Red and Blue) and we want to find the minimum number of players (pigeons) required to ensure that there are at least 3 players on the same team.\n\nIf we have 3 players, it's possible that they could be split evenly between the two teams (2 players on one team and 1 player on the other). However, as soon as we add a 4th player, it's guaranteed that one of the teams will have at least 3 players, since there are only 2 teams for the players to be divided into.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of players required to ensure that there are at least 3 players on the same team or 3 players on different teams is 4."
