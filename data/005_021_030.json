    "message_1": "A math student wants to estimate the average height of students in their school. They measure the height of 20 randomly selected students and find that the average height is 165 cm with a standard deviation of 5 cm. Using bootstrapping, determine a 95% confidence interval for the true average height of students in the school.",
    "message_2": "To determine a 95% confidence interval for the true average height of students in the school using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000) from the original sample of 20 students' heights. Each bootstrap sample should also have 20 heights, drawn with replacement from the original sample.\n\n2. Calculate the average height for each bootstrap sample.\n\n3. Arrange the calculated average heights in ascending order.\n\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap average heights. These percentiles will serve as the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nLet's assume we have performed the bootstrapping process and obtained the following results:\n\n- 2.5th percentile of bootstrap average heights: 162.5 cm\n- 97.5th percentile of bootstrap average heights: 167.5 cm\n\nThus, the 95% confidence interval for the true average height of students in the school is approximately (162.5 cm, 167.5 cm)."
