    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 6 cm and a slant height of 10 cm. Find the surface area of the cone, correct to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 6 cm and l = 10 cm.\n\nSurface Area = π(6)(6 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(6)(16)\nSurface Area = 96π\n\nNow, we'll approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 96 * 3.14\nSurface Area ≈ 301.44 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 301.44 cm², correct to two decimal places."
