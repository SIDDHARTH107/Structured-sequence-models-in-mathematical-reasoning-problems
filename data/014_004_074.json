    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example precise numerical problem from elliptic curve cryptography:\n\n\"Suppose we have an elliptic curve with equation E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the field F29. Also suppose that we have a generator point G = (15,9) on this curve. If we want to calculate 7G, what is the resulting point on the curve?\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate 7G, we will use the point doubling and point addition operations on the elliptic curve. We will perform these operations in the field F29.\n\nFirst, let's calculate 2G:\nTo double a point, we use the following formulas:\nλ = (3x₁^2 + a) / 2y₁ (mod p)\nx₃ = λ^2 - x₁ - x₂ (mod p)\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod p)\n\nFor G = (15, 9), a = 2, and p = 29:\nλ = (3 * 15^2 + 2) / (2 * 9) (mod 29)\nλ = (3 * 225 + 2) / 18 (mod 29)\nλ = (675 + 2) / 18 (mod 29)\nλ = 677 / 18 (mod 29)\nλ = 8\n\nNow, we can calculate x₃ and y₃:\nx₃ = 8^2 - 15 - 15 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 64 - 30 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 34 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 5\n\ny₃ = 8(15 - 5) - 9 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 8 * 10 - 9 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 80 - 9 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 71 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 13\n\nSo, 2G = (5, 13).\n\nNow, we need to calculate 4G by doubling 2G:\nFor 2G = (5, 13), a = 2, and p = 29:\nλ = (3 * 5^2 + 2) / (2 * 13) (mod 29)\nλ = (3 * 25 + 2) / 26 (mod 29)\nλ = (75 + 2) / 26 (mod 29)\nλ = 77 / 26 (mod 29)\nλ = 20\n\nNow, we can calculate x₃ and y₃:\nx₃ = 20^2 - 5 - 5 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 400 - 10 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 390 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 6\n\ny₃ = 20(5 - 6) - 13 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 20 * (-1) - 13 (mod 29)\ny₃ = -20 - 13 (mod 29)\ny₃ = -33 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 25\n\nSo, 4G = (6, 25).\n\nFinally, we need to calculate 7G by adding 3G (which is G + 2G) and 4G:\nTo add two points, we use the following formulas:\nλ = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁) (mod p)\nx₃ = λ^2 - x₁ - x₂ (mod p)\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ (mod p)\n\nFor G = (15, 9), 2G = (5, 13), and p = 29:\nλ = (13 - 9) / (5 - 15) (mod 29)\nλ = 4 / (-10) (mod 29)\nλ = 4 * (-10)^(-1) (mod 29)\nλ = 4 * 3 (mod 29) (since -10 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 29))\nλ = 12\n\nNow, we can calculate 3G:\nx₃ = 12^2 - 15 - 5 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 144 - 20 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 124 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 7\n\ny₃ = 12(15 - 7) - 9 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 12 * 8 - 9 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 96 - 9 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 87 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 0\n\nSo, 3G = (7, 0).\n\nNow, we need to add 3G and 4G to get 7G:\nFor 3G = (7, 0), 4G = (6, 25), and p = 29:\nλ = (25 - 0) / (6 - 7) (mod 29)\nλ = 25 / (-1) (mod 29)\nλ = 25 * (-1)^(-1) (mod 29)\nλ = 25 * (-1) (mod 29) (since -1 * (-1) ≡ 1 (mod 29))\nλ = -25 (mod 29)\nλ = 4\n\nNow, we can calculate 7G:\nx₃ = 4^2 - 7 - 6 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 16 - 13 (mod 29)\nx₃ = 3\n\ny₃ = 4(7 - 3) - 0 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 4 * 4 (mod 29)\ny₃ = 16\n\nSo, 7G = (3, 16)."
