    "message_1": "Consider a used car market in which there are two types of cars: high-quality cars and low-quality cars. The proportion of high-quality cars in the market is 60%, and the proportion of low-quality cars is 40%. The seller of the car knows the quality of the car, but the buyer cannot distinguish between the two types of cars. The expected values of high-quality and low-quality cars are $10,000 and $5,000, respectively.\n\nAssuming that the buyers are risk-averse, what is the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for a used car in this market? Assume that the buyers expect the car to be high-quality with a probability of 60% and low-quality with a probability of 40%.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum price a risk-averse buyer is willing to pay for a used car in this market, we need to calculate the expected value of a car based on the probabilities of it being high-quality or low-quality.\n\nExpected Value (EV) = (Probability of High-Quality Car * Value of High-Quality Car) + (Probability of Low-Quality Car * Value of Low-Quality Car)\n\nEV = (0.6 * $10,000) + (0.4 * $5,000)\nEV = ($6,000) + ($2,000)\nEV = $8,000\n\nSo, the maximum price a risk-averse buyer is willing to pay for a used car in this market is $8,000."
