    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n2 & -1 & -3 & 8 \\\\\n3 & 4 & 5 & 9\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first variable (x) from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we can replace the second row with the result of (-2 times the first row) + the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -5 & -2 \\\\\n3 & 4 & 5 & 9\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we can replace the third row with the result of (-3 times the first row) + the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -5 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & -6\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second variable (y) from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we can replace the third row with the result of (1/3 times the second row) + the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -5 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 3: Back-substitution\n\nFrom the third row, we have $z = -4$. Substitute this value into the second row to find y:\n\n$-3y - 5(-4) = -2$\n\n$-3y + 20 = -2$\n\n$-3y = -22$\n\n$y = \\frac{22}{3}$\n\nNow, substitute the values of y and z into the first row to find x:\n\n$x + \\frac{22}{3} - 4 = 5$\n\n$x = 5 - \\frac{22}{3} + 4$\n\n$x = \\frac{15 - 22 + 12}{3}$\n\n$x = \\frac{5}{3}$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{5}{3}, \\quad y = \\frac{22}{3}, \\quad z = -4\n$$"
