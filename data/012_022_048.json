    "message_2": "R(3, 5) likely refers to the Ramsey number R(m, n), which is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices contains either a clique of size m (a complete subgraph with m vertices) or an independent set of size n (a set of n vertices with no edges between them). \n\nIn this case, you are asking for the Ramsey number R(3, 5). Unfortunately, the exact value of R(3, 5) is currently unknown. It is known that R(3, 5) is between 14 and 43, but the exact value has not yet been determined."
