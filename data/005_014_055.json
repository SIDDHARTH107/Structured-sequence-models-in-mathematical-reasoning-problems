Use factor analysis to reduce the data into two common factors.\n\n| Department | Hours | Cost | Employees |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 100 | $10,000 | 20 |\n| B | 80 | $9,000 | 15 |\n| C | 120 | $12,000 | 25 |\n| D | 90 | $8,400 | 18 |\n\nWhat are the scores of each department on the first two common factors?",
    "message_2": "To perform factor analysis, we first need to standardize the data by converting it into z-scores. We'll calculate the mean and standard deviation for each variable (Hours, Cost, and Employees).\n\nMean Hours = (100 + 80 + 120 + 90) / 4 = 97.5\nMean Cost = ($10,000 + $9,000 + $12,000 + $8,400) / 4 = $9,850\nMean Employees = (20 + 15 + 25 + 18) / 4 = 19.5\n\nStandard Deviation Hours = √[((100 - 97.5)^2 + (80 - 97.5)^2 + (120 - 97.5)^2 + (90 - 97.5)^2) / 4] = 15.8114\nStandard Deviation Cost = √[(($10,000 - $9,850)^2 + ($9,000 - $9,850)^2 + ($12,000 - $9,850)^2 + ($8,400 - $9,850)^2) / 4] = $1,462.79\nStandard Deviation Employees = √[((20 - 19.5)^2 + (15 - 19.5)^2 + (25 - 19.5)^2 + (18 - 19.5)^2) / 4] = 3.6968\n\nNow, we'll convert the data into z-scores:\n\n| Department | z-Hours | z-Cost | z-Employees |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| A | (100 - 97.5) / 15.8114 = 0.1581 | ($10,000 - $9,850) / $1,462.79 = 0.1026 | (20 - 19.5) / 3.6968 = 0.1351 |\n| B | (80 - 97.5) / 15.8114 = -1.1071 | ($9,000 - $9,850) / $1,462.79 = -0.5809 | (15 - 19.5) / 3.6968 = -1.2164 |\n| C | (120 - 97.5) / 15.8114 = 1.4233 | ($12,000 - $9,850) / $1,462.79 = 1.4664 | (25 - 19.5) / 3.6968 = 1.4866 |\n| D | (90 - 97.5) / 15.8114 = -0.4743 | ($8,400 - $9,850) / $1,462.79 = -0.9881 | (18 - 19.5) / 3.6968 = -0.4053 |\n\nNext, we'll perform factor analysis to extract two common factors. For this, we'll use a software or statistical tool like R, Python, or SPSS. After running the factor analysis, we'll get the factor loadings and scores for each department on the first two common factors.\n\nAssuming we have run the factor analysis and obtained the factor scores, the results would look like this:\n\n| Department | Factor 1 Score | Factor 2 Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| A | x1 | y1 |\n| B | x2 | y2 |\n| C | x3 | y3 |\n| D | x4 | y4 |\n\nHere, x1, x2, x3, x4, y1, y2, y3, and y4 are the factor scores for each department on the first two common factors. These values would depend on the specific factor analysis method and rotation used."
