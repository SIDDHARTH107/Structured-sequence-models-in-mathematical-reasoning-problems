    "message_2": "To prove that Set B (the empty set) is a subset of Set A, we need to show that every element in Set B is also an element of Set A. \n\nBy definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in Set B that are not in Set A. This means that Set B is a subset of Set A.\n\nThe property that the empty set is a subset of every set is a universally accepted mathematical principle. Since Set A is a set, it follows that the empty set (Set B) is a subset of Set A."
