    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping, we can use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. \n\nWe want to map the unit disk $\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}: |z|<1\\}$ onto the right half plane $\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}: \\operatorname{Re}(z)>0\\}$, with the point $z=0$ being mapped onto the origin. \n\nLet's find the Möbius transformation that maps three points on the unit disk to three points on the right half plane. We can choose the points $z_1 = 0$, $z_2 = 1$, and $z_3 = -1$ on the unit disk, and their corresponding points on the right half plane as $w_1 = 0$, $w_2 = \\infty$, and $w_3 = 1$.\n\nUsing the cross ratio property of Möbius transformations, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{f(z) - f(z_1)}{f(z) - f(z_3)} \\cdot \\frac{f(z_3) - f(z_2)}{f(z_1) - f(z_2)} = \\frac{z - z_1}{z - z_3} \\cdot \\frac{z_3 - z_2}{z_1 - z_2}$$\n\nPlugging in the values of $z_1, z_2, z_3, w_1, w_2, w_3$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{f(z)}{f(z) - 1} = \\frac{z}{z + 1}$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z}{z + 1}(f(z) - 1)$$\n$$f(z) + f(z)z = zf(z) - z$$\n$$f(z)(1 - z) = -z$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is a Möbius transformation, we can write it as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{az + b}{cz + d}(1 - z) = -z$$\n\nTo satisfy this equation for all $z$, we can choose $a = 1$, $b = 0$, $c = 1$, and $d = 1$. This gives us the Möbius transformation:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z}{z + 1}$$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the mapping at the point $z = -1$:\n\n$$f(-1) = \\frac{-1}{-1 + 1}$$\n\nHowever, this expression is undefined, as the denominator is zero. This is expected, as the point $z = -1$ is on the boundary of the unit disk, and the Möbius transformation maps it to the point at infinity in the right half plane."
