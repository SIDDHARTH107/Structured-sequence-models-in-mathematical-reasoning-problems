    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative dω of the given differential form ω, we need to apply the exterior derivative operator to each term in the expression for ω. Recall that the exterior derivative operator acts on a function f as df, and on a differential form α as dα. Also, recall the following properties of the exterior derivative:\n\n1. Linearity: d(α + β) = dα + dβ\n2. Leibniz rule: d(α ∧ β) = dα ∧ β + (-1)^p α ∧ dβ, where α is a p-form.\n\nNow, let's apply the exterior derivative operator to ω:\n\ndω = d(xe^y dx + dy)\n\nUsing linearity, we can split this into two terms:\n\ndω = d(xe^y dx) + d(dy)\n\nNow, we need to apply the Leibniz rule to the first term. Since xe^y is a scalar function, we have:\n\nd(xe^y dx) = d(xe^y) ∧ dx\n\nTo find d(xe^y), we apply the exterior derivative operator to the scalar function xe^y:\n\nd(xe^y) = (∂(xe^y)/∂x) dx + (∂(xe^y)/∂y) dy\n\nTaking the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nd(xe^y) = e^y dx + xe^y dy\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expression for d(xe^y dx):\n\nd(xe^y dx) = (e^y dx + xe^y dy) ∧ dx\n\nUsing the anti-symmetry property of the wedge product (α ∧ β = - β ∧ α), we can simplify this expression:\n\nd(xe^y dx) = e^y dx ∧ dx + xe^y dy ∧ dx\n\nSince the wedge product of a form with itself is zero (α ∧ α = 0), we have:\n\nd(xe^y dx) = 0 + xe^y dy ∧ dx\n\nNow, let's consider the second term in the expression for dω:\n\nd(dy) = (∂y/∂x) dx + (∂y/∂y) dy\n\nSince ∂y/∂x = 0 and ∂y/∂y = 1, we have:\n\nd(dy) = 0 dx + 1 dy\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for d(xe^y dx) and d(dy) back into the expression for dω:\n\ndω = xe^y dy ∧ dx + 1 dy\n\nFinally, we can write the result as:\n\ndω = xe^y dy ∧ dx + dy\n\nThis is the exterior derivative of the given differential form ω."
