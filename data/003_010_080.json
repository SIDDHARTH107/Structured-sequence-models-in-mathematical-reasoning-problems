    "message_1": "A lighthouse is located 200 meters away from a port. An observer at the port measures the angle of elevation to the top of the lighthouse to be 40 degrees. Calculate the height of the lighthouse.  (Assume the height of the observer is negligible.)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the height of the lighthouse, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 40 degrees, the distance from the port to the lighthouse (adjacent side) is 200 meters, and we want to find the height of the lighthouse (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(40°) = height / 200\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 200:\n\nheight = 200 * tan(40°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 40 degrees:\n\ntan(40°) ≈ 0.8391\n\nNow, multiply this value by 200:\n\nheight ≈ 200 * 0.8391\nheight ≈ 167.82\n\nThe height of the lighthouse is approximately 167.82 meters."
