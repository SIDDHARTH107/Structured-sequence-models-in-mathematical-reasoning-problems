    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 4 books from a shelf containing 7 books using Pascal's triangle, we need to find the binomial coefficient C(7, 4). Pascal's triangle is constructed by starting with a 1 at the top and then adding the two numbers above each number to get the number below. The nth row of Pascal's triangle corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a+b)^n. The number in the kth position of the nth row is C(n, k).\n\nHere's the beginning of Pascal's triangle:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n```\n\nWe are looking for C(7, 4), which is in the 7th row (starting from 0) and the 4th position (starting from 0). In Pascal's triangle, this number is 35.\n\nSo, there are 35 ways to choose 4 books from a shelf containing 7 books, where the order of the books does not matter."
