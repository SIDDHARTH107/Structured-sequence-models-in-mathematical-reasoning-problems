    "message_2": "A Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to each side. After each iteration, the number of sides increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nAfter four iterations, the number of sides is 3 * 4^4 = 3 * 256 = 768, and the length of each side is 10 * (1/3)^4 = 10 * (1/81) = 10/81 cm.\n\nThe total perimeter of the Koch snowflake after four iterations is the product of the number of sides and the length of each side:\n\nPerimeter = 768 * (10/81) = 7680/81 â‰ˆ 94.81 cm."
