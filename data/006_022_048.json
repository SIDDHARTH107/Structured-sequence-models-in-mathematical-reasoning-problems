    "message_1": "A school has 60 students who are taking a probability course, out of which 30 are females and 30 are males. What is the probability of selecting a male student randomly from the class?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a male student randomly from the class, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of male students, which is 30. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of students in the class, which is 60.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a male student randomly from the class is:\n\nProbability = 30 / 60\n\nProbability = 1 / 2\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a male student randomly from the class is 1/2 or 50%."
