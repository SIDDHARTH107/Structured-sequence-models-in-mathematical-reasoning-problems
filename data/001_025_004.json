    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we first group the terms with x on one side and the constants on the other side.\n\n(2 + 3i)x - (1 - 4i)x = (6 + 9i) - (4 - 5i)\n\nNow, we can factor out x from the left side:\n\nx[(2 + 3i) - (1 - 4i)] = (6 + 9i) - (4 - 5i)\n\nSimplify the expressions inside the brackets:\n\nx[(2 + 3i) - 1 + 4i] = (6 + 9i) - 4 + 5i\n\nx[1 + 7i] = 2 + 14i\n\nNow, to solve for x, we can divide both sides by (1 + 7i):\n\nx = (2 + 14i) / (1 + 7i)\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator (1 - 7i):\n\nx = [(2 + 14i)(1 - 7i)] / [(1 + 7i)(1 - 7i)]\n\nMultiply the numerators and denominators:\n\nx = (2 - 14 + 98i + 14i^2) / (1 - 49i^2)\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can substitute it into the expression:\n\nx = (2 - 14 + 98i - 14) / (1 + 49)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nx = (98i - 26) / 50\n\nDivide both the real and imaginary parts by 50:\n\nx = (-26/50) + (98/50)i\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\nx = -13/25 + (49/25)i\n\nSo, the value of x is x = -13/25 + (49/25)i."
