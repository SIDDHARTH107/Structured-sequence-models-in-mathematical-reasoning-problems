    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours of labor and 4 hours of machines processing, while each unit of Product B requires 4 hours of labor and 5 hours of machines processing. The factory has 450 hours of labor and 600 hours of machines processing available per week. The profit on each unit of product A is $10 and the profit on each unit of product B is $15. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the factory can make per week, assuming they want to produce at least 50 units of each product and they are only allowed to invest up to $2000 in raw material costs per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 3x + 4y ≤ 450 (each unit of A requires 3 hours of labor and each unit of B requires 4 hours)\n2. Machine constraint: 4x + 5y ≤ 600 (each unit of A requires 4 hours of machine processing and each unit of B requires 5 hours)\n3. Minimum production constraint: x ≥ 50 and y ≥ 50 (at least 50 units of each product must be produced)\n4.
