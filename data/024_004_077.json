    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,3), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the surface equation:\n\nz = x^2 - y^2 + 3\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = -2y\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = -2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we can find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 = 1 + (2*1)^2 = 5\nF = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y) = 2*1*(-2*1) = -4\nG = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2 = 1 + (-2*1)^2 = 5\n\nAnd the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = ∂²z/∂x² = 2\nM = ∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\nN = ∂²z/∂y² = -2\n\nNow we can find the mean curvature H using the formula:\n\nH = (1/2) * (EG - F^2)^(-1) * (LE + 2MF + GN)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nH = (1/2) * (5*5 - (-4)^2)^(-1) * (2*5 + 2*0 + (-2)*5)\nH = (1/2) * (25 - 16)^(-1) * (10 - 10)\nH = (1/2) * (9)^(-1) * (0)\nH = 0\n\nThe mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,3) is 0."
