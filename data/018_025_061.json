Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the intersection of A and B, and finally, find the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with B. Show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nSymmetric Difference (A, B) = (A - B) âˆª (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1, 2}\nB - A = {6, 7}\n\nSymmetric Difference (A, B) = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements which are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection (A, B) = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with B.\n\nIntersection (Symmetric Difference (A, B), B) = Intersection ({1, 2, 6, 7}, {3, 4, 5, 6, 7})\n\nIntersection (Symmetric Difference (A, B), B) = {6, 7}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection. Commutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter. In this case, we need to check if:\n\nIntersection (Symmetric Difference (A, B), B) = Intersection (B, Symmetric Difference (A, B))\n\nWe have already calculated both sides of the equation:\n\nIntersection (Symmetric Difference (A, B), B) = {6, 7}\nIntersection (B, Symmetric Difference (A, B)) = {6, 7}\n\nSince both sides are equal, the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection."
