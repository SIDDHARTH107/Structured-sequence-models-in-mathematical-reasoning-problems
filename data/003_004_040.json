    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2 cos(2x) + 3 sin(x) = 1, we can use the double-angle formula for cosine, which states that cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x). \n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n2(1 - 2sin^2(x)) + 3sin(x) = 1\n\nExpanding and rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation in terms of sin(x):\n\n4sin^2(x) - 3sin(x) + 1 = 0\n\nLet y = sin(x). The equation becomes:\n\n4y^2 - 3y + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = -3, and c = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(4)(1))) / (2(4))\ny = (3 ± √(9 - 16)) / 8\ny = (3 ± √(-7)) / 8\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for y, which means there are no real solutions for sin(x). Therefore, there are no real solutions for x in the given equation."
