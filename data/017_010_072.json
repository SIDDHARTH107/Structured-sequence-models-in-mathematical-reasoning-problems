    "message_2": "A group of order 10 has two possible structures: Z_10 (cyclic group) and D_5 (dihedral group).\n\n1. In the cyclic group Z_10, there is only one element of order 2. The group structure is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, where the operation is addition modulo 10. The element 5 has order 2, as 5 + 5 = 10 â‰¡ 0 (mod 10).\n\n2. In the dihedral group D_5, there are four elements of order 2. The group structure can be represented as {1, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3, sr^4}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The elements of order 2 are s, sr, sr^2, and sr^3, as squaring any of these elements gives the identity element 1.\n\nSo, there can be either one or four elements of order 2 in a group of order 10, depending on the group structure (cyclic or dihedral)."
