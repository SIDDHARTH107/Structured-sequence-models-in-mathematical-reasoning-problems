    "message_2": "To find all solutions to this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to reduce the system to its row echelon form.\n\nThe augmented matrix for this system is:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[ 2  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 1  2  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate the 2 in the second row, first column. To do this, we'll subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0  3 -5 | 0 ]\n[ 1  2  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 1 in the third row, first column. To do this, we'll subtract the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0  3 -5 | 0 ]\n[ 0  3 -1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll eliminate the 3 in the third row, second column. To do this, we'll subtract the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0  3 -5 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  4 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, the system is in row echelon form. We can write the corresponding system of linear equations:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nx - y + 2z &= 0 \\\\\n3y - 5z &= 0 \\\\\n4z &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\nFrom the third equation, we have that z = 0. Now, we can substitute this value into the second equation:\n\n3y - 5(0) = 0 => y = 0\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of y and z into the first equation:\n\nx - 0 + 2(0) = 0 => x = 0\n\nSo, the only solution to this homogeneous system of linear equations is the trivial solution (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)."
