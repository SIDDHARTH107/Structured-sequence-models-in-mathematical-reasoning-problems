    "message_1": "A student wants to determine the height of a nearby tree without climbing it. They stand 50 meters away from the tree and measure the angle of elevation to the top of the tree to be 40 degrees. What is the height of the tree to the nearest meter? (Assume the ground is flat and level.)",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 40 degrees, and the distance from the student to the tree is 50 meters. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(40) = height / 50\n\nTo solve for the height, multiply both sides by 50:\n\nheight = 50 * tan(40)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nheight ≈ 50 * 0.8391\nheight ≈ 41.955\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the tree is approximately 42 meters."
