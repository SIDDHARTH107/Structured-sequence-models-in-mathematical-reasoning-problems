    "message_2": "To find the value of the complex function f(z) = (z^2 - 4)^(1/2) at z = -2 + 3i using analytic continuation, we first need to rewrite the function in a more suitable form.\n\nLet's rewrite the function as f(z) = (z - 2)(z + 2)^(1/2). Now, we can use the identity (a + b)^(1/2) = a^(1/2) * (1 + b/a)^(1/2) to rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = ((z - 2) * (1 + (z + 2)/(z - 2))^(1/2))\n\nNow, let's substitute z = -2 + 3i into the function:\n\nf(-2 + 3i) = ((-2 + 3i - 2) * (1 + (-2 + 3i + 2)/(-2 + 3i - 2))^(1/2))\n\nf(-2 + 3i) = (3i * (1 + 3i/3i)^(1/2))\n\nf(-2 + 3i) = (3i * (1 + 1)^(1/2))\n\nf(-2 + 3i) = (3i * 2^(1/2))\n\nf(-2 + 3i) = 3i * √2\n\nSo, the value of the complex function f(z) = (z^2 - 4)^(1/2) at z = -2 + 3i using analytic continuation is 3i * √2."
