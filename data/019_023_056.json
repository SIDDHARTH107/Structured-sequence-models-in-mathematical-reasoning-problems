    "message_2": "The given sequence is a list of perfect squares. Each term in the sequence can be represented as the square of an integer: \n\n1 = 1^2\n4 = 2^2\n9 = 3^2\n16 = 4^2\n25 = 5^2\n\nTo find the next two terms, we can continue this pattern by squaring the next two integers:\n\n6^2 = 36\n7^2 = 49\n\nSo, the next two terms in the sequence are 36 and 49."
