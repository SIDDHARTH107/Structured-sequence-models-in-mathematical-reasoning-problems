    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using Laplace transforms, we first take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Laplace transform of a function y(t) is defined as:\n\nL{y(t)} = Y(s) = ∫[0,∞] e^(-st) y(t) dt\n\nApplying the Laplace transform to the given differential equation:\n\nL{y''(x) + y'(x) + y(x)} = L{cos(x)}\n\nUsing the linearity property of Laplace transforms, we can write:\n\nL{y''(x)} + L{y'(x)} + L{y(x)} = L{cos(x)}\n\nNow, we need to find the Laplace transforms of y''(x), y'(x), and y(x). Recall the following properties of Laplace transforms:\n\n1. L{y'(t)} = sY(s) - y(0)\n2. L{y''(t)} = s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)\n3. L{cos(t)} = s / (s^2 + 1)\n\nApplying these properties and the given initial conditions (y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0):\n\nL{y''(x)} = s^2Y(s) - s(1) - 0 = s^2Y(s) - s\nL{y'(x)} = sY(s) - 1\nL{y(x)} = Y(s)\nL{cos(x)} = s / (s^2 + 1)\n\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the transformed differential equation:\n\n(s^2Y(s) - s) + (sY(s) - 1) + Y(s) = s / (s^2 + 1)\n\nCombine the terms with Y(s):\n\nY(s)(s^2 + s + 1) = s / (s^2 + 1) + s + 1\n\nNow, solve for Y(s):\n\nY(s) = (s + s^2 + 1) / (s^2 + s + 1) = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to get the particular solution y(x):\n\ny(x) = L^(-1){1}\n\nRecall that L^(-1){1} = 1, so the particular solution is:\n\ny(x) = 1"
