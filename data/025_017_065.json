    "message_2": "To find the points on the curve where the tangent line is horizontal, we need to find the points where the derivative of the curve with respect to x is equal to 0. \n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x. We can do this by implicitly differentiating the given equation with respect to x:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 5$\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 3 + 0$\n\nNow, we want to find the points where the tangent line is horizontal, which means the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is equal to 0. So, we set $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ and solve for x:\n\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 3$\n\n$0 = 3x^2 - 3$\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n$0 = x^2 - 1$\n\nFactor the equation:\n\n$0 = (x - 1)(x + 1)$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x:\n\n$x = 1$ and $x = -1$\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding y values for these x values. We can do this by plugging the x values back into the original equation:\n\nFor $x = 1$:\n\n$y^2 = (1)^3 - 3(1) + 5$\n\n$y^2 = 1 - 3 + 5$\n\n$y^2 = 3$\n\n$y = \\pm\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSo, the points on the curve where the tangent line is horizontal for $x = 1$ are $(1, \\sqrt{3})$ and $(1, -\\sqrt{3})$.\n\nFor $x = -1$:\n\n$y^2 = (-1)^3 - 3(-1) + 5$\n\n$y^2 = -1 + 3 + 5$\n\n$y^2 = 7$\n\n$y = \\pm\\sqrt{7}$\n\nSo, the points on the curve where the tangent line is horizontal for $x = -1$ are $(-1, \\sqrt{7})$ and $(-1, -\\sqrt{7})$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of all the points on the curve where the tangent line is horizontal are $(1, \\sqrt{3})$, $(1, -\\sqrt{3})$, $(-1, \\sqrt{7})$, and $(-1, -\\sqrt{7})$."
