    "message_1": "A researcher wants to compare the median monthly salary of employees in two different companies. To do this, he collected the following data sets:\n\nCompany A: \\$2,800, \\$2,500, \\$2,700, \\$3,100, \\$3,800, \\$2,400, \\$2,900\nCompany B: \\$2,300, \\$2,800, \\$2,600, \\$2,900, \\$4,000\n\nUsing the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, can the researcher conclude that the median monthly salary of employees in Company A is significantly different from that of Company B? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we first need to combine the two data sets and rank them in ascending order:\n\nCombined data: \\$2,300, \\$2,400, \\$2,500, \\$2,600, \\$2,700, \\$2,800, \\$2,800, \\$2,900, \\$2,900, \\$3,100, \\$3,800, \\$4,000\nRanks:          1,      2,      3,      4,      5,      6,      7,      8,      9,     10,     11,     12,     13\n\nNow, we need to calculate the rank sum for each company:\n\nCompany A rank sum: 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 + 12 + 1 + 8 = 41\nCompany B rank sum: 4 + 6.5 + 7 + 9 + 13 = 39.5\n\nNext, we need to calculate the expected rank sum and the standard deviation for the smaller sample (Company B):\n\nn_A = 7 (number of observations in Company A)\nn_B = 5 (number of observations in Company B)\n\nExpected rank sum for Company B: E_B = n_B * (n_A + n_B + 1) / 2 = 5 * (7 + 5 + 1) / 2 = 5 * 13 / 2 = 32.5\n\nStandard deviation for Company B: SD_B = sqrt(n_A * n_B * (n_A + n_B + 1) / 12) = sqrt(7 * 5 * 13 / 12) ≈ 4.96\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (rank sum of Company B - E_B) / SD_B = (39.5 - 32.5) / 4.96 ≈ 1.41\n\nUsing a significance level of 0.05 (two-tailed test), we compare the z-score to the critical value from the standard normal distribution table (z_critical ≈ 1.96). Since 1.41 < 1.96, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the researcher cannot conclude that the median monthly salary of employees in Company A is significantly different from that of Company B."
