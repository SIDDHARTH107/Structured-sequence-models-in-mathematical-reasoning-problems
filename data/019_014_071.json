    "message_1": "Let X be a set containing 3 elements. In higher-order logic, how many binary relations can be defined on X?",
    "message_2": "A binary relation on a set X is a subset of the Cartesian product X × X. Since X has 3 elements, the Cartesian product X × X will have 3 × 3 = 9 elements. \n\nTo define a binary relation, we can choose to include or exclude each of the 9 elements in the relation. So, for each element, there are 2 choices (either include it or exclude it). \n\nTherefore, there are 2^9 = 512 possible binary relations that can be defined on a set X containing 3 elements."
