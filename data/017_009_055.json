    "message_2": "First, we note that there is no non-abelian group of order 9. This is because the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups, and 9 = 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is that there is exactly one 3-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal. Therefore, any group of order 9 must be abelian.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 9. Since G is abelian, the order of an element divides the order of the group. The possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nCase 1: There exists an element of order 9 in G.\n\nLet g be an element of order 9 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by g, ⟨g⟩, has order 9. Since the order of ⟨g⟩ is equal to the order of G, we have that G = ⟨g⟩. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 9, and it is isomorphic to C9.\n\nCase 2: There is no element of order 9 in G.\n\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 3. Let g and h be two distinct non-identity elements of G. Since both have order 3, we have g^3 = h^3 = e (where e is the identity element).\n\nNow, consider the element gh. Since G is abelian, we have (gh)^3 = g^3h^3 = ee = e. Thus, gh also has order 3. Since g and h are distinct non-identity elements, gh cannot be equal to g or h. Furthermore, gh cannot be equal to e, as that would imply g = h^(-1), contradicting the assumption that g and h are distinct.\n\nTherefore, we have at least four distinct elements of order 3 in G: g, h, gh, and e. However, this contradicts the fact that G has order 9. Thus, there cannot be a group of order 9 without an element of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 9 must have an element of order 9, and it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
