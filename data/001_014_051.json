    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to break down each square root into its prime factors and look for any perfect squares that can be simplified.\n\n√12 - √27 + √48\n\n12 = 2 × 2 × 3 (prime factorization)\n27 = 3 × 3 × 3 (prime factorization)\n48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 (prime factorization)\n\nNow, we look for perfect squares within the prime factorization of each number:\n\n√12 = √(2 × 2 × 3) = √(2² × 3) = 2√3\n√27 = √(3 × 3 × 3) = √(3³) = 3√3\n√48 = √(2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3) = √(2⁴ × 3) = 4√3\n\nNow we can substitute these simplified square roots back into the expression:\n\n2√3 - 3√3 + 4√3\n\nNow, we can combine the terms with the same square root:\n\n(2 - 3 + 4)√3 = 3√3\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n3√3"
