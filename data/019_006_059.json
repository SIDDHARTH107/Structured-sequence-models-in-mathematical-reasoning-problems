    "message_1": "Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot generate a precise numerical problem related to deontic logic as it involves ethical reasoning rather than mathematical calculations. Deontic logic deals with prescribing norms or rules of conduct and studying logical relationships between statements about what is obligatory, permissible, or forbidden. Hence, it does not involve numerical or quantitative problems.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are looking for a mathematical problem to solve. Here's a problem for you:\n\nIf a train is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour and it takes 2 hours to reach its destination, how far is the destination from the starting point?\n\nTo solve this problem, use the formula: distance = speed Ã— time."
