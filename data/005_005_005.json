    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule) for normal distributions. The empirical rule states that for a normal distribution:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.\n- Approximately 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean.\n- Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean.\n\nIn this case, we are given a mean length of 75 centimeters and a standard deviation of 2 centimeters. We want to find the percentage of shoelaces with a length between 72 and 78 centimeters.\n\nFirst, let's find how many standard deviations away from the mean the lengths 72 and 78 centimeters are:\n\n- For 72 centimeters: (72 - 75) / 2 = -3 / 2 = -1.5 standard deviations\n- For 78 centimeters: (78 - 75) / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5 standard deviations\n\nSo, we are looking for the percentage of shoelaces that fall within -1.5 and 1.5 standard deviations of the mean. This range falls between 1 and 2 standard deviations of the mean. Using the empirical rule, we know that:\n\n- 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.\n- 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean.\n\nSince the range of -1.5 to 1.5 standard deviations is between 1 and 2 standard deviations, we can estimate that the percentage of shoelaces with a length between 72 and 78 centimeters is between 68% and 95%. To get a more accurate estimate, we can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Z ≤ 1.5) ≈ 0.9332 (probability that a shoelace is less than or equal to 1.5 standard deviations above the mean)\n- P(Z ≤ -1.5) ≈ 0.0668 (probability that a shoelace is less than or equal to 1.5 standard deviations below the mean)\n\nTo find the percentage of shoelaces with a length between 72 and 78 centimeters, we subtract the probability of being less than or equal to -1.5 standard deviations from the probability of being less than or equal to 1.5 standard deviations:\n\nP(-1.5 ≤ Z ≤ 1.5) = P(Z ≤ 1.5) - P(Z ≤ -1.5) = 0.9332 - 0.0668 = 0.8664\n\nSo, approximately 86.64% of the shoelaces produced by the factory have a length between 72 and 78 centimeters."
