    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we can examine the properties of the elements in G.\n\nFirst, let's recall the structure of C4 and V4:\n\nC4 = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element and a has order 4.\n\nV4 = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c have order 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G. Since G has order 4, there are 4 elements in G. Let's denote them as e, x, y, and z, where e is the identity element.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nIf G has an element of order 4, let's say x, then G = {e, x, x^2, x^3}. In this case, G is isomorphic to C4, as it has the same structure.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 4.\nIf G has no element of order 4, then all non-identity elements in G must have order 2. This means that x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = e. In this case, G has the structure {e, x, y, z}, where x, y, and z have order 2. This is the same structure as V4, so G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we need to examine the orders of the elements in G. If G has an element of order 4, then G is isomorphic to C4. If all non-identity elements in G have order 2, then G is isomorphic to V4."
