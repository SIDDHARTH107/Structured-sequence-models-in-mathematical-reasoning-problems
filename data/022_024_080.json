    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on z and the other only on t:\n\n$\\phi(z,t) = F(z)G(t)$\n\nNow we can rewrite the given equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\phi(z,t)}{\\partial t} = 4\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi(z,t)}{\\partial z \\partial \\overline{z}}$\n\nas\n\n$F(z) \\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = 4 \\frac{d^2F(z)}{dz d\\overline{z}} G(t)$\n\nNow we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $F(z)G(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{G(t)} \\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = 4 \\frac{1}{F(z)} \\frac{d^2F(z)}{dz d\\overline{z}}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on z, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call k:\n\n$\\frac{1}{G(t)} \\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = k = 4 \\frac{1}{F(z)} \\frac{d^2F(z)}{dz d\\overline{z}}$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) $\\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = kG(t)$\n2) $\\frac{d^2F(z)}{dz d\\overline{z}} = \\frac{k}{4}F(z)$\n\nThe general solution to the first equation is:\n\n$G(t) = Ce^{kt}$, where C is a constant.\n\nThe second equation is a bit more complicated. We can rewrite it as:\n\n$\\frac{d^2F(z)}{dz d\\overline{z}} = \\frac{k}{4}F(z)$\n\nLet's assume that F(z) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on the real part of z and the other only on the imaginary part of z:\n\n$F(z) = X(x)Y(y)$, where $z = x + iy$\n\nNow we can rewrite the second equation as:\n\n$\\frac{d^2(X(x)Y(y))}{dx dy} = \\frac{k}{4}X(x)Y(y)$\n\nNow we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{X(x)} \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{k}{4} - \\frac{1}{Y(y)} \\frac{d^2Y(y)}{dy^2}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call m:\n\n$\\frac{1}{X(x)} \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = m$\n\n$\\frac{1}{Y(y)} \\frac{d^2Y(y)}{dy^2} = \\frac{k}{4} - m$\n\nNow we have two more ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n3) $\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = mX(x)$\n4) $\\frac{d^2Y(y)}{dy^2} = (\\frac{k}{4} - m)Y(y)$\n\nThe general solutions to these equations are:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{m}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{m}x)$\n$Y(y) = D\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4} - m}y) + E\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4} - m}y)$\n\nNow we can write the general solution for F(z):\n\n$F(z) = (A\\cos(\\sqrt{m}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{m}x))(D\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4} - m}y) + E\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4} - m}y))$\n\nAnd the general solution for $\\phi(z,t)$:\n\n$\\phi(z,t) = Ce^{kt}(A\\cos(\\sqrt{m}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{m}x))(D\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4} - m}y) + E\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4} - m}y))$\n\nNow we need to find the initial condition:\n\n$\\phi(z,0) = z^2$\n\nThis means that:\n\n$Ce^{0}(A\\cos(\\sqrt{m}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{m}x))(D\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4} - m}y) + E\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4} - m}y)) = (x+iy)^2$\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we can find the values of A, B, D, and E. However, this is a very complicated process, and it is not necessary to find the value of $\\phi(i,3)$.\n\nInstead, we can use the initial condition to find the value of $\\phi(i,3)$ directly:\n\n$\\phi(i,3) = (i)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$\n\nSo the value of $\\phi(i,3)$ is 1."
