    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 17 cm and a leg of length 8 cm. What is the length of the other leg, if the triangle is a right triangle?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the other leg be x cm. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case:\n\n17^2 = 8^2 + x^2\n289 = 64 + x^2\n\nNow, subtract 64 from both sides of the equation:\n\n289 - 64 = x^2\n225 = x^2\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the other leg:\n\nx = âˆš225\nx = 15\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 15 cm."
