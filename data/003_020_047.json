    "message_2": "To find how far north and how far east the ship is from the port, we can use the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. \n\nFirst, let's find the total distance the ship has traveled. The ship travels at a speed of 30 knots for 5 hours, so the total distance is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\nDistance = 30 knots × 5 hours = 150 nautical miles\n\nNow, we can use the angle of 25 degrees north of east to find the north and east components of the distance traveled.\n\nNorth component (y) = Distance × sin(angle)\nEast component (x) = Distance × cos(angle)\n\nWe have the angle in degrees, so we need to convert it to radians before using the trigonometric functions:\n\nAngle in radians = (25 degrees × π) / 180\nAngle in radians ≈ 0.4363 radians\n\nNow, we can find the north and east components:\n\nNorth component (y) = 150 nautical miles × sin(0.4363 radians) ≈ 64.28 nautical miles\nEast component (x) = 150 nautical miles × cos(0.4363 radians) ≈ 134.16 nautical miles\n\nSo, the ship is approximately 64.28 nautical miles north and 134.16 nautical miles east from the port, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
