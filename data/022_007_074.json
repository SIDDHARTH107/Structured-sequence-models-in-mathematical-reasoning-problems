    "message_2": "To prove that $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z+2}$ cannot be a polynomial of degree 2 on the complex plane using Liouville's theorem, we first need to understand what Liouville's theorem states:\n\nLiouville's theorem: If a function $f(z)$ is entire (i.e., holomorphic on the entire complex plane) and bounded (i.e., there exists a constant M such that $|f(z)| \\leq M$ for all z in the complex plane), then $f(z)$ must be a constant function.\n\nNow, let's analyze the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z+2}$. We can see that this function is not entire, as it has a pole at $z = -2$. This means that the function is not holomorphic on the entire complex plane.\n\nHowever, let's assume for the sake of contradiction that $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree 2. Then, it must be entire, as polynomials are entire functions. This creates a contradiction, as we have already established that $f(z)$ is not entire due to the pole at $z = -2$.\n\nTherefore, $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z+2}$ cannot be a polynomial of degree 2 on the complex plane."
