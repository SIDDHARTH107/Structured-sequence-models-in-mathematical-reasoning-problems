    "message_2": "To find the volume of the largest sphere that can be inscribed inside the cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, its diameter will be equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 6 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius of the sphere = Diameter / 2 = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3 = (4/3) * π * 27 cm^3 = 36π cm^3\n\nSo, the exact volume of the largest sphere that can be inscribed inside the cube is 36π cm^3."
