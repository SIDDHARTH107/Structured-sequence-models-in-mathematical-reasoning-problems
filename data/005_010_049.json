    "message_1": "Suppose you want to test a new medication for a specific disease. You know that the previous medication was successful in 60% of cases. You recruited 100 patients for your trial, and 50 of them received the new medication. Among those 50 patients, 40 responded positively to the treatment. What is the probability that the new medication is more effective than the previous one?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that the new medication is more effective than the previous one, we can use a statistical hypothesis test. In this case, we will use a one-tailed Z-test to compare the proportions of success between the two medications.\n\nLet p1 be the proportion of success for the previous medication and p2 be the proportion of success for the new medication.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): p1 >= p2 (The new medication is not more effective than the previous one)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): p1 < p2 (The new medication is more effective than the previous one)\n\nGiven:\np1 = 0.60 (60% success rate for the previous medication)\nn1 = 100 (total number of patients)\nx1 = 0.6 * 100 = 60 (number of successful cases with the previous medication)\n\np2 = 40/50 = 0.80 (80% success rate for the new medication)\nn2 = 50 (number of patients who received the new medication)\nx2 = 40 (number of successful cases with the new medication)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the pooled proportion (pp) and the standard error (SE):\n\npp = (x1 + x2) / (n1 + n2) = (60 + 40) / (100 + 50) = 100 / 150 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667\n\nSE = sqrt[pp * (1 - pp) * (1/n1 + 1/n2)] = sqrt[(2/3) * (1/3) * (1/100 + 1/50)] ≈ 0.0816\n\nNow, we calculate the Z-score:\n\nZ = (p2 - p1) / SE = (0.80 - 0.60) / 0.0816 ≈ 2.45\n\nUsing a Z-table or calculator, we find the probability (p-value) corresponding to a Z-score of 2.45:\n\np-value ≈ 0.9922\n\nSince this is a one-tailed test, the p-value represents the probability that the new medication is more effective than the previous one:\n\nProbability = 1 - p-value = 1 - 0.9922 ≈ 0.0078\n\nSo, there is approximately a 0.78% probability that the new medication is more effective than the previous one, given the observed data."
