If the loop has a total resistance of 10 ohms, find the current induced in the loop when the magnetic field changes at a rate of 200 T/s.\n\n(Note: This problem involves finding the solution to the differential equation for the induced current caused by a changing magnetic field, which is given by Faraday's law of induction, one of Maxwell's equations.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Faraday's law of induction, which states that the electromotive force (EMF) induced in a closed loop of wire is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop. Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\nEMF = -dΦ/dt\n\nwhere Φ is the magnetic flux and t is time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnetic flux through the circular loop. The magnetic flux is given by:\n\nΦ = B * A\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field and A is the area of the loop. Since the loop is circular, its area can be calculated as:\n\nA = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the loop. In this case, the radius is 5 cm, which is equal to 0.05 meters. Therefore, the area of the loop is:\n\nA = π * (0.05)^2 ≈ 0.00785 m^2\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic flux through the loop:\n\nΦ = B * A = 0.5 T * 0.00785 m^2 ≈ 0.00393 Tm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the rate of change of the magnetic field, which is given as 200 T/s. The rate of change of the magnetic flux is then:\n\ndΦ/dt = A * dB/dt = 0.00785 m^2 * 200 T/s = 1.57 Tm^2/s\n\nNow, we can find the induced EMF using Faraday's law:\n\nEMF = -dΦ/dt = -1.57 V (The negative sign indicates the direction of the induced EMF, but we are only interested in the magnitude here.)\n\nFinally, we can find the induced current using Ohm's law:\n\nI = EMF / R\n\nwhere I is the induced current and R is the resistance of the loop. In this case, the resistance is 10 ohms. Therefore, the induced current is:\n\nI = 1.57 V / 10 Ω ≈ 0.157 A\n\nSo, the current induced in the loop when the magnetic field changes at a rate of 200 T/s is approximately 0.157 A."
