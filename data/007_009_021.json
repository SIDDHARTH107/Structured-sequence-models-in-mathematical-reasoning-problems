To compute φ(36), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of 36:\n\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n\nNow, we can plug the distinct prime factors into the formula:\n\nφ(36) = 36 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(36) = 36 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(36) = 36 * (1/3)\nφ(36) = 12\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function φ(36) is 12."
