    "message_2": "To find the digital signature of the message M = 1234 using the RSA algorithm, we need to raise the message to the power of the signer's private key d and then take the modulus with respect to N.\n\nDigital Signature (S) = M^d mod N\n\nHere, M = 1234, d = 7, and N = 2537.\n\nS = 1234^7 mod 2537\n\nTo calculate this, you can use a calculator or a programming language like Python:\n\n```python\nM = 1234\nd = 7\nN = 2537\n\nS = pow(M, d, N)\nprint(S)\n```\n\nS = 2201\n\nSo, the digital signature of the message M = 1234 using the RSA algorithm with the given private key and modulus is 2201."
