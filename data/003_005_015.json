    "message_2": "To find the value of theta in degrees, we will use the inverse sine function, also known as arcsin or sin^(-1). \n\nsin^(-1)(0.5) = theta\n\nUsing a calculator or a trigonometric table, we find the value of theta:\n\ntheta â‰ˆ 30 degrees\n\nSo, the value of theta is approximately 30 degrees. Note that sine is a periodic function with a period of 360 degrees, so there are infinitely many angles that have a sine value of 0.5. However, the principal value (the one in the range of -90 to 90 degrees) is 30 degrees."
