    "message_2": "Let's use the method of generating functions to solve this problem. We want to find the coefficient of x^8 in the expansion of the following generating function:\n\n(1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^3\n\nThis represents the number of ways to form three teams with at least two members each, where the exponent of x represents the number of employees in a team.\n\nExpanding the generating function, we get:\n\n(1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^3 = 1 + 3x^2 + 6x^4 + 7x^6 + 6x^8 + 3x^10 + x^12\n\nThe coefficient of x^8 is 6, which means there are 6 ways to form the teams.\n\nHowever, this counts each possible arrangement of teams 3! = 6 times (since there are 3! ways to arrange the teams). To get the actual number of ways to form the teams, we need to divide the coefficient by 3!:\n\n6 / 3! = 6 / 6 = 1\n\nSo there is only 1 way to form the teams with at least two members each. This would be with teams of sizes 2, 2, and 4."
