If they want to share these fruits among themselves, such that both of them get the same number of apples and oranges, then how many fruits they will have each at the end?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we need to set up a system of linear congruences. Let x be the number of fruits each person will have at the end. We have the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 4 (mod 5) (for apples)\nx ≡ 7 (mod 6) (for oranges)\n\nNow, we will apply the Chinese remainder theorem. First, we need to find the product of the moduli, which is N = 5 * 6 = 30.\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverses. Let's compute N1 and N2, where N1 = N/5 = 6 and N2 = N/6 = 5. Now, we need to find the modular inverses of N1 and N2:\n\n6 * a1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n5 * a2 ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n\nBy inspection or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that a1 = 1 and a2 = 5.\n\nNow, we can compute x using the formula:\n\nx = (4 * N1 * a1 + 7 * N2 * a2) % N\nx = (4 * 6 * 1 + 7 * 5 * 5) % 30\nx = (24 + 175) % 30\nx = 199 % 30\nx = 19\n\nSo, each person will have 19 fruits at the end (Alice will have 19 apples and Bob will have 19 oranges)."
