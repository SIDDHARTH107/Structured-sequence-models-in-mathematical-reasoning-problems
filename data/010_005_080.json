    "message_2": "To determine if the set A U B is path-connected, we need to check if there exists a continuous path between any two points in the set.\n\nSet A is the interior of a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 1, and set B is the interior of a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. These two circles do not intersect, and there is a gap between them along the x-axis.\n\nLet's consider two points, one from each set: point a ∈ A and point b ∈ B. To show that A U B is not path-connected, we need to show that there is no continuous path between these two points that lies entirely within A U B.\n\nSuppose there exists a continuous path between points a and b. This path must cross the gap between the two circles at some point. Let's call this point c. Since c lies on the boundary of both circles, we have:\n\nc^2 = (x_c)^2 + (y_c)^2 = 1 (from circle A)\nand\n(x_c - 2)^2 + (y_c)^2 = 1 (from circle B)\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n(x_c - 2)^2 - (x_c)^2 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we have:\n\n4x_c - 4 = 0\nx_c = 1\n\nHowever, this contradicts the fact that there is a gap between the two circles along the x-axis, as the x-coordinate of the point c would be exactly in the middle of the gap. Therefore, there cannot be a continuous path between points a and b that lies entirely within A U B.\n\nHence, the set A U B is not path-connected."
