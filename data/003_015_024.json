    "message_2": "A sinusoidal function can be written in the form:\n\nf(x) = A * sin(Bx + C) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, we are given the amplitude A = 5 and the period P = π/2. We are not given any information about the phase shift or vertical shift, so we will assume C = 0 and D = 0.\n\nTo find the value of B, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod (P) = 2π / B\n\nPlugging in the given period:\n\nπ/2 = 2π / B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 4\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the sinusoidal function:\n\nf(x) = 5 * sin(4x)"
