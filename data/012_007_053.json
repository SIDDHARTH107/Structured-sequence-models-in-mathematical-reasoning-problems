    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node 1 to node 5, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will start with an initial flow of 0 and iteratively find augmenting paths to increase the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initial flow: 0\n\n2. Find an augmenting path:\n- Path: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5\n- Bottleneck capacity: min(5, 3, 4) = 3\n- Update flow: 0 + 3 = 3\n\n3. Find another augmenting path:\n- Path: 1 -> 3 -> 5\n- Bottleneck capacity: min(4, 5) = 4\n- Update flow: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n4. Find another augmenting path:\n- Path: 1 -> 2 -> 5\n- Bottleneck capacity: min(2, 2) = 2\n- Update flow: 7 + 2 = 9\n\n5. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow from node 1 to node 5 is 9."
