    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cylindrical tank using integration, we can consider the tank as a series of infinitesimally thin circular disks stacked on top of each other. The volume of each disk can be found using the formula for the area of a circle (πr^2) multiplied by its infinitesimal thickness (dh). Then, we can integrate this expression over the height of the tank to find the total volume.\n\nLet's set up the integral:\n\nV = ∫[πr^2 dh]\n\nSince the radius of the tank is constant (4 meters), we can treat it as a constant in the integral:\n\nV = π(4^2) ∫[dh] from 0 to 8\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to h:\n\nV = 16π ∫[dh] from 0 to 8\n\nV = 16π [h] from 0 to 8\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nV = 16π (8 - 0)\n\nV = 16π * 8\n\nV = 128π\n\nThe volume of the cylindrical tank is 128π cubic meters, or approximately 402.12 cubic meters."
