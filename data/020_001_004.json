    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit of A is $10 and the profit per unit of B is $15. The company has two machines, Machine 1 and Machine 2. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of machine time on Machine 1 and 1 hour of machine time on Machine 2. Each unit of product B requires 1 hour of machine time on Machine 1 and 3 hours of machine time on Machine 2. Machine 1 is available for 80 hours and Machine 2 is available for 70 hours. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit function to maximize is P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nThe constraints for the machine hours are:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 80 (Machine 1)\n2. x + 3y ≤ 70 (Machine 2)\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints.\n\n1. y ≤ -2x + 80\n2. y ≤ -(1/3)x + 70/3\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 23.33), (30, 20), and (40, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 23.33) = 10(0) + 15(23.33) = $349.95\n3. P(30, 20) = 10(30) + 15(20) = $600\n4. P(40, 0) = 10(40) + 15(0) = $400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (30, 20), with a profit of $600. Therefore, the company should produce 30 units of product A and 20 units of product B to maximize their profit."
