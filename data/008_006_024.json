    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the matrix A. The characteristic equation is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[1 - λ, 2], [2, 4 - λ]]\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (1 - λ)(4 - λ) - (2 * 2)\n                     = λ^2 - 5λ\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we set the determinant equal to zero and solve for λ:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ = 0\nλ(λ - 5) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 0 and λ2 = 5.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 0:\n\n(A - λ1I) * v1 = 0\n[[1, 2], [2, 4]] * [x1, x2] = [0, 0]\n\n1 * x1 + 2 * x2 = 0\n2 * x1 + 4 * x2 = 0\n\nThe second equation is a multiple of the first equation, so we only need to consider one of them. Let's take the first equation:\n\nx1 + 2 * x2 = 0\nx1 = -2 * x2\n\nWe can choose x2 = 1, so x1 = -2. Therefore, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 = 0 is:\n\nv1 = [-2, 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 5:\n\n(A - λ2I) * v2 = 0\n[[-4, 2], [2, -1]] * [x1, x2] = [0, 0]\n\n-4 * x1 + 2 * x2 = 0\n2 * x1 - 1 * x2 = 0\n\nThe second equation is a multiple of the first equation, so we only need to consider one of them. Let's take the first equation:\n\n-4 * x1 + 2 * x2 = 0\nx1 = 1/2 * x2\n\nWe can choose x2 = 2, so x1 = 1. Therefore, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 = 5 is:\n\nv2 = [1, 2]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 0 and λ2 = 5, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [-2, 1] and v2 = [1, 2]."
