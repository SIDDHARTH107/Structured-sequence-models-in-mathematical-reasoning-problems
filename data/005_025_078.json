    "message_1": "Suppose a coffee shop owner wants to estimate the average number of cups of coffee sold per day. In a sample of 30 days, the average number of cups sold was 150 with a standard deviation of 20 cups. What is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean (150 cups)\nt = t-score (based on the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom, which is n-1)\ns = sample standard deviation (20 cups)\nn = sample size (30 days)\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score for a 95% confidence interval and 29 degrees of freedom (n-1). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the t-score is approximately 2.045.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 150 ± (2.045 * (20 / √30))\n\nConfidence Interval = 150 ± (2.045 * (20 / 5.477))\n\nConfidence Interval = 150 ± (2.045 * 3.652)\n\nConfidence Interval = 150 ± 7.475\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (142.525, 157.475) cups of coffee sold per day. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true average number of cups of coffee sold per day in the population lies between 142.525 and 157.475 cups."
