    "message_2": "To determine whether the system has a unique solution or not, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to transform the system into an upper triangular matrix and then solve it using back-substitution.\n\nFirst, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 2  3 -1 |  8 |\n| 1 -2  1 | -3 |\n| 4  1 -2 | 12 |\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | -3 |\n| 2  3 -1 |  8 |\n| 4  1 -2 | 12 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 4 in the first column of rows 2 and 3:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1:\n| 1 -2  1 | -3 |\n| 0  7 -3 | 14 |\n| 4  1 -2 | 12 |\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 4 * Row 1:\n| 1 -2  1 | -3 |\n| 0  7 -3 | 14 |\n| 0  9 -6 | 24 |\n\nStep 3: Divide row 2 by 7 to get a 1 in the second row, second column:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | -3 |\n| 0  1 -3/7 | 2 |\n| 0  9 -6 | 24 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 9 in the second column of row 3:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 9 * Row 2:\n| 1 -2  1 | -3 |\n| 0  1 -3/7 | 2 |\n| 0  0  3 | 6 |\n\nStep 5: Divide row 3 by 3 to get a 1 in the third row, third column:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | -3 |\n| 0  1 -3/7 | 2 |\n| 0  0  1 | 2 |\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = 2\n\ny - 3/7 * z = 2\ny - 3/7 * 2 = 2\ny = 2 + 6/7\ny = 20/7\n\nx - 2y + z = -3\nx - 2(20/7) + 2 = -3\nx - 40/7 + 2 = -3\nx = -3 + 40/7 - 2\nx = -3 + 40/7 - 14/7\nx = 23/7\n\nSo, the unique solution for the system is x = 23/7, y = 20/7, and z = 2."
