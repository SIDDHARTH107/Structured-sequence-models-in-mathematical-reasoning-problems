    "message_2": "Let's consider the 2 specific books as a single unit since they must be next to each other. Now, we have 4 units to arrange (3 individual books and 1 pair of books). There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange these 4 units.\n\nHowever, within the pair of books, there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the 2 specific books.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the 5 different books with the 2 specific books next to each other is:\n\n4! × 2! = 24 × 2 = 48 ways."
