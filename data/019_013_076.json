Define the predicate R as:\n\nR(P,Q) = \"For all even numbers x, if x is a multiple of 3 then x/3 is also even\"\n\nNow, evaluate the truth value of R for the given predicates P and Q.",
    "message_2": "To evaluate the truth value of R(P,Q), we need to check if the statement \"For all even numbers x, if x is a multiple of 3 then x/3 is also even\" is true or false.\n\nLet's consider an even number x, which can be written as x = 2k, where k is an integer. Now, if x is also a multiple of 3, then x can be written as x = 3m, where m is an integer.\n\nSince x is both even and a multiple of 3, we can write x = 2k = 3m. Now, we need to check if x/3 is even. \n\nx/3 = (2k)/3 = 2(k/3)\n\nFor x/3 to be even, k/3 must be an integer. From the equation 2k = 3m, we can write k = (3m)/2. Since m is an integer, k is divisible by 3 if and only if m is even (i.e., m = 2n for some integer n).\n\nIn this case, k = (3m)/2 = (3(2n))/2 = 3n, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, x/3 = 2(k/3) = 2(3n/3) = 2n, which is even.\n\nThus, the statement \"For all even numbers x, if x is a multiple of 3 then x/3 is also even\" is true, and the truth value of R(P,Q) is true."
