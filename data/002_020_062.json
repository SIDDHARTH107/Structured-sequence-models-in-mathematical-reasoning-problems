    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of the sector, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is in degrees.\n\nArc length = (75 / 360) × 2π(6)\nArc length = (1/4.8) × 12π\nArc length = (1/4.8) × 37.68 (approx., since 12π ≈ 37.68)\nArc length ≈ 7.85 cm\n\nNow, let's add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = 7.85 + 2(6)\nPerimeter = 7.85 + 12\nPerimeter ≈ 19.85 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 19.85 cm."
