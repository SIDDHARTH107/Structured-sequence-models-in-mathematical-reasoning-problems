    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution $u(x, y)$ can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on $x$ and the other on $y$. That is, $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. \n\nNow, we can substitute this expression into the PDE:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} -i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} +u = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}Y(y) - i\\frac{Y'(y)}{Y(y)}X(x) + X(x)Y(y) = 0$\n\nTo separate the variables, we set:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + X(x) = \\lambda$ and $-i\\frac{Y'(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda$\n\nSolving the ODEs for $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$:\n\n1) $X''(x) + (\\lambda - X(x))X(x) = 0$\n\n2) $-iY'(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for equation (2) is:\n\n$Y(y) = Ce^{i\\lambda y}$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nNow, we need to solve equation (1). This is a nonlinear ODE, and it is difficult to find an explicit solution. However, we can use the boundary conditions to simplify the problem.\n\nGiven that $u(0, y) = \\sin(2y)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(0, y) = 0$, we have:\n\n$X(0)Y(y) = \\sin(2y)$ and $X'(0)Y(y) = 0$\n\nSince $X'(0) = 0$, we can assume that $X(x) = \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. Now, we can write the solution as:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)Ce^{i\\lambda y}$\n\nTo find the constant $C$ and $\\lambda$, we can use the boundary condition $u(0, y) = \\sin(2y)$:\n\n$\\cos(0)Ce^{i\\lambda y} = \\sin(2y)$\n\nSince $\\cos(0) = 1$, we have:\n\n$Ce^{i\\lambda y} = \\sin(2y)$\n\nNow, we can use a Fourier sine series to represent the function $\\sin(2y)$:\n\n$\\sin(2y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n e^{i\\lambda_n y}$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we can find the values of $C_n$ and $\\lambda_n$. Therefore, the complex solution to the given PDE is:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda_n}x)e^{i\\lambda_n y}$"
