    "message_2": "There is no unique solution to this system of linear equations because the two equations are dependent, meaning they represent the same line.\n\nTo see this, notice that the second equation can be obtained by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n\n(2)(2x + 3y) = (2)(7)\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nSince the two equations represent the same line, they have infinitely many solutions that correspond to all the points on the line. There is no unique solution (x, y) that satisfies both equations."
