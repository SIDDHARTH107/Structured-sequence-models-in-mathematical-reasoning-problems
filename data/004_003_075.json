The cost function of producing x units per week is given by C(x) = 5000 + 12x + 0.005x², where C(x) is measured in dollars. The revenue function of selling x units per week is given by R(x) = 16x² - 4x³, where R(x) is measured in dollars. Find the value of x that maximizes the profit function P(x) = R(x) - C(x).",
    "message_2": "To find the value of x that maximizes the profit function P(x) = R(x) - C(x), we first need to find the derivative of P(x) with respect to x and then set it equal to 0 to find the critical points.\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (16x² - 4x³) - (5000 + 12x + 0.005x²)\n\nP(x) = -4x³ + 16x² - 12x - 0.005x² - 5000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nP(x) = -4x³ + 15.995x² - 12x - 5000\n\nNow, find the derivative of P(x) with respect to x:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = -12x² + 31.99x - 12\n\nSet P'(x) equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = -12x² + 31.99x - 12\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -12, b = 31.99, and c = -12.\n\nx = (-31.99 ± √(31.99² - 4(-12)(-12))) / 2(-12)\n\nx = (-31.99 ± √(1023.3601 - 576)) / -24\n\nx = (-31.99 ± √447.3601) / -24\n\nx ≈ 0.381 or x ≈ 8.281\n\nWe have two critical points, x ≈ 0.381 and x ≈ 8.281. To determine which one maximizes the profit, we can use the second derivative test.\n\nFind the second derivative of P(x) with respect to x:\n\nP''(x) = d²P(x)/dx² = -24x + 31.99\n\nEvaluate P''(x) at both critical points:\n\nP''(0.381) ≈ -24(0.381) + 31.99 ≈ 23.056 > 0, which indicates a local minimum.\n\nP''(8.281) ≈ -24(8.281) + 31.99 ≈ -165.344 < 0, which indicates a local maximum.\n\nTherefore, the value of x that maximizes the profit function P(x) is x ≈ 8.281 units per week."
