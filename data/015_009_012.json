    "message_1": "Consider a chaotic system with a Lyapunov exponent of 0.5. If the initial condition of the system is changed by a small amount, such that the separation between the trajectories doubles in a time interval of 10s, what is the predicted rate of divergence of the trajectories after 100s?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted rate of divergence of the trajectories after 100s, we can use the formula for the separation of trajectories in a chaotic system:\n\nΔx(t) = Δx(0) * e^(λt)\n\nwhere Δx(t) is the separation between trajectories at time t, Δx(0) is the initial separation, λ is the Lyapunov exponent, and t is the time.\n\nWe know that the separation doubles in 10s, so we can write:\n\n2 * Δx(0) = Δx(0) * e^(0.5 * 10)\n\nDividing both sides by Δx(0):\n\n2 = e^(5)\n\nNow, we want to find the separation after 100s:\n\nΔx(100) = Δx(0) * e^(0.5 * 100)\n\nSince we want the rate of divergence, we can divide Δx(100) by Δx(0):\n\nΔx(100) / Δx(0) = e^(0.5 * 100) = e^50\n\nSo, the predicted rate of divergence of the trajectories after 100s is e^50 times the initial separation."
