    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 7 cm. What is its surface area?",
    "message_2": "The surface area of a cylinder can be found using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr(h + r)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 7 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(7 + 5)\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(12)\nSurface Area = 10π(12)\nSurface Area = 120π\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder is 120π square centimeters, or approximately 376.99 square centimeters."
