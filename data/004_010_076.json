    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 7, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 7, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\n1. For the term 3x^2, n = 2. Applying the power rule, we get:\n   (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\n2. For the term 5x, n = 1. Applying the power rule, we get:\n   (5x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (5x^2)/2 = (5/2)x^2\n\n3. For the constant term -7, we can treat it as -7x^0, with n = 0. Applying the power rule, we get:\n   (-7x^(0+1))/(0+1) = -7x\n\nNow, we can combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + (5/2)x^2 - 7x + C"
