    "message_2": "The total length of the dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, and we want to find the total length after 10 iterations. So, we have:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^10)\n\nLength = 1 * 1024\n\nLength = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024 units."
