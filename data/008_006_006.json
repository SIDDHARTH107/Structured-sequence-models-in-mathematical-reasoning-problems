The eigenvectors can be found by solving the equation (A - λI)x = 0, where x is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0. \n\nA - λI = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 3 - λ & 2 \\\\\n 1 & 4 - λ \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)(4 - λ) - (2)(1) = λ^2 - 7λ + 10\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we set the determinant equal to 0 and solve for λ:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 10 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as (λ - 2)(λ - 5) = 0, which gives us two eigenvalues:\n\nλ₁ = 2\nλ₂ = 5\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)x = 0.\n\nFor λ₁ = 2:\n\n(A - λ₁I)x = (A - 2I)x = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & 2 \\\\\n 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n x₁ \\\\\n x₂ \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\nx₁ + 2x₂ = 0\n\nWe can find the eigenvector by setting x₂ = 1:\n\nx₁ = -2\nx₂ = 1\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to λ₁ = 2 is:\n\nv₁ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n -2 \\\\\n 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nFor λ₂ = 5:\n\n(A - λ₂I)x = (A - 5I)x = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n -2 & 2 \\\\\n 1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n x₁ \\\\\n x₂ \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\n-2x₁ + 2x₂ = 0\n\nWe can find the eigenvector by setting x₁ = 1:\n\nx₁ = 1\nx₂ = 1\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to λ₂ = 5 is:\n\nv₂ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 \\\\\n 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of the matrix A are:\n\nλ₁ = 2 with eigenvector v₁ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n -2 \\\\\n 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nλ₂ = 5 with eigenvector v₂ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 \\\\\n 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}"
