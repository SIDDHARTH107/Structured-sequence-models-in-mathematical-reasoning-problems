    "message_2": "To show that H is a cyclic group, we need to find an element in H that generates the entire subgroup H.\n\nSince G is a cyclic group of order 12, there exists an element g in G such that G = {g^0, g^1, ..., g^11}. The order of g is 12, which means that g^12 = e (the identity element), and no smaller power of g is equal to e.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H of order 4. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since the order of H is 4 and the order of G is 12, we have that 4 divides 12. \n\nLet h be an element in H. Since the order of H is 4, the order of h must be a divisor of 4. The possible orders of h are 1, 2, or 4. If the order of h is 1, then h = e, which is not a generator for H. If the order of h is 2, then H = {e, h}, which contradicts the fact that the order of H is 4. Therefore, the order of h must be 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the powers of h: H = {h^0, h^1, h^2, h^3}. Since the order of h is 4, we have h^4 = e, and no smaller power of h is equal to e. Thus, the element h generates the entire subgroup H, which means that H is a cyclic group."
