    "message_1": "What is the probability of a company experiencing a financial fraud given that there is a 10% chance of an employee committing fraud and the company has 50 employees?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. Instead of calculating the probability of at least one employee committing fraud, we can calculate the probability of none of the employees committing fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet P(F) be the probability of an employee committing fraud, and P(NF) be the probability of an employee not committing fraud. We are given that P(F) = 0.10, so P(NF) = 1 - P(F) = 0.90.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of none of the 50 employees committing fraud. Since the employees' actions are assumed to be independent, the probability of all 50 employees not committing fraud is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\nP(All NF) = P(NF)^50 = (0.90)^50 ≈ 0.00515\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one employee committing fraud by subtracting the probability of none of them committing fraud from 1:\n\nP(At least 1 F) = 1 - P(All NF) = 1 - 0.00515 ≈ 0.99485\n\nSo, the probability of the company experiencing financial fraud is approximately 99.485%."
