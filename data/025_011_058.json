    "message_2": "The torsion subgroup of an Abelian variety A defined over the complex numbers is the set of points in A that have finite order. The order of the torsion subgroup is the number of elements in this subgroup.\n\nFor an elliptic curve E defined over the complex numbers, the torsion subgroup is isomorphic to either Z/nZ or Z/nZ x Z/mZ, where n and m are positive integers. In the first case, the order of the torsion subgroup is n, and in the second case, the order is n * m.\n\nHowever, there is no general formula for the order of the torsion subgroup of an Abelian variety defined over the complex numbers, as it depends on the specific variety and the field of definition. The order of the torsion subgroup can be computed using the structure theorem for finitely generated Abelian groups, but this requires knowledge of the specific Abelian variety in question."
