    "message_1": "A 20 N force is required to lift a 5 kg object from the ground to a height of 10 meters. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the force and the direction of the displacement. In this case, the force is acting vertically upwards, and the displacement is also vertical, so the angle θ is 0 degrees. The cosine of 0 degrees is 1, so the formula simplifies to:\n\nWork = Force × Distance\n\nWe are given the force (F) as 20 N and the distance (h) as 10 meters. So, the work done (W) can be calculated as:\n\nW = F × h\n\nW = 20 N × 10 m\n\nW = 200 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force to lift the 5 kg object to a height of 10 meters is 200 Joules."
