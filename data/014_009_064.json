    "message_1": "Suppose you have a Feistel cipher structure with a block size of 64 bits and 16 rounds. Each round uses a 48-bit key, and each key is used only once. If each round also includes a 32-bit round constant, what is the total size of the key schedule for this Feistel cipher?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total size of the key schedule for this Feistel cipher, we need to consider both the 48-bit keys and the 32-bit round constants for each of the 16 rounds.\n\nFor the 48-bit keys, there are 16 rounds, so the total size for the keys is:\n16 rounds * 48 bits per key = 768 bits\n\nFor the 32-bit round constants, there are also 16 rounds, so the total size for the round constants is:\n16 rounds * 32 bits per round constant = 512 bits\n\nNow, we add the total size of the keys and the round constants to find the total size of the key schedule:\n768 bits (keys) + 512 bits (round constants) = 1280 bits\n\nSo, the total size of the key schedule for this Feistel cipher is 1280 bits."
