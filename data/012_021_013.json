    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph and then find the width of that decomposition. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. If a vertex v is in bags X and Y, then it must be in all bags on the path between X and Y in the tree decomposition.\n\nHere's one possible tree decomposition for the given graph:\n\n```\n       {1,2}\n       /   \\\n   {2,3}   {2,6}\n    /       /   \\\n{3,4} {3,5} {6,7}\n```\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus one. In this case, the largest bag has 2 vertices, so the treewidth is 2 - 1 = 1."
