    "message_2": "To find the degree of the curve, we first need to eliminate the parameter $t$ from the given parametric equations. We have:\n\n$x = \\frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}$ and $y = \\frac{2t}{t^2+1}$.\n\nFrom the equation for $x$, we can solve for $t^2$:\n\n$t^2 = \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $t^2$ into the equation for $y$:\n\n$y = \\frac{2t}{\\frac{1+x}{1-x} + 1}$.\n\nTo eliminate $t$, we can square both sides of the equation for $y$:\n\n$y^2 = \\frac{4t^2}{(\\frac{1+x}{1-x} + 1)^2}$.\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $t^2$ back into the equation:\n\n$y^2 = \\frac{4(\\frac{1+x}{1-x})}{(\\frac{1+x}{1-x} + 1)^2}$.\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n$y^2 = \\frac{4(\\frac{1+x}{1-x})}{(\\frac{2}{1-x})^2}$.\n\nNow, cancel out the common factors:\n\n$y^2 = \\frac{4(1+x)}{4}$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$y^2 = 1+x$.\n\nThis is the equation of the curve in the $xy$-plane. Since it is a quadratic equation, the degree of the curve is 2.\n\nNow, to find the genus of the curve, we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In this case, $d = 2$, so:\n\n$g = \\frac{(2-1)(2-2)}{2} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 0}{2} = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the genus of the curve is 0."
