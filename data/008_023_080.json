    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations as accurately as possible, we will first find the solution for the original system and then consider the possible variations in the coefficients.\n\nOriginal system:\n```\nx + y + z = 10.5\n2x - y + 3z = 7.8\n3x + 2y + 2z = 21.1\n```\n\nWe can solve this system using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. Here, we will use the matrix method.\n\nLet A be the matrix of coefficients, X be the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B be the column matrix of constants:\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |\n    | 2 -1  3 |\n    | 3  2  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10.5 |\n    |  7.8 |\n    | 21.1 |\n\nWe can find the solution by calculating the inverse of A and multiplying it by B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find:\n\nA^(-1) = |  0.4 -0.6  0.2 |\n         | -0.6  0.8 -0.2 |\n         |  0.8 -0.4  0.2 |\n\nMultiplying A^(-1) by B:\n\nX = |  0.4 -0.6  0.2 |   | 10.5 |   |  1.0 |\n    | -0.6  0.8 -0.2 | * |  7.8 | = |  2.0 |\n    |  0.8 -0.4  0.2 |   | 21.1 |   |  7.5 |\n\nSo, the solution for the original system is x = 1.0, y = 2.0, and z = 7.5.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible variations in the coefficients due to measurement errors. Since the coefficients can vary by up to ±0.3, we can't find an exact solution for all possible variations. However, we can estimate the range of values for x, y, and z based on the original solution.\n\nFor example, if the coefficient of x in the first equation increases by 0.3, the value of x might decrease slightly, and vice versa. Similarly, the values of y and z might also change depending on the variations in their coefficients.\n\nIn conclusion, the most accurate solution we can provide for the noisy system of equations is x ≈ 1.0, y ≈ 2.0, and z ≈ 7.5, keeping in mind that the actual values might slightly differ due to the measurement errors."
