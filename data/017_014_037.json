    "message_2": "To prove that H is a normal subgroup of G, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a subgroup divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem).\n2. If the index of a subgroup is the smallest prime dividing the order of the group, then the subgroup is normal.\n\nSince |H| = 5 and |G| = 20, we have that the index of H in G is [G:H] = |G|/|H| = 20/5 = 4. The smallest prime dividing the order of G is 2, so the index of H in G is not the smallest prime dividing the order of G. However, the next smallest prime dividing the order of G is 5, which is equal to the index of H in G. Therefore, by fact 2, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to either C20 or the non-abelian group of order 20. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is equal to the index of H in G, which is 4. There are two groups of order 4 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n\nIf G/H is isomorphic to C4, then G is an extension of H by C4. Since H is cyclic of order 5, it is isomorphic to C5. In this case, G is an extension of C5 by C4, and the only such extension is the cyclic group C20. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C20.\n\nIf G/H is isomorphic to V4, then G is an extension of H by V4. In this case, G is an extension of C5 by V4. The only non-abelian group of order 20 is the semidirect product of C5 and V4, which we will denote as C5 ⋊ V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C5 ⋊ V4.\n\nIn conclusion, if H is a subgroup of G with |H| = 5 and |G| = 20, then H is a normal subgroup of G, and G is isomorphic to either C20 or the non-abelian group of order 20 (C5 ⋊ V4)."
