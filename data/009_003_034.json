Here's a question:\n\nA bar of length 1 meter is heated from one end, and the temperature of the bar satisfies the diffusion equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nsubject to the boundary conditions:\n\n$T(0,t)=100$ and $T(1,t)=300$\n\nand the initial condition:\n\n$T(x,0)=0$.\n\nIf the thermal diffusivity of the bar is $k=0.01 \\text{m}^2\\text{/s}$, find the temperature of the bar at $x=0.5$ meter and $t=10$ seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the temperature function can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$. That is, let $T(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the diffusion equation, we get:\n\n$X(x) \\frac{dT}{dt} = k T(t) \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$.\n\nNow, divide both sides by $kXT$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{kT} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$.\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $\\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda^2$\n\n2) $\\frac{1}{kT} \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda^2$.\n\nThe second equation can be easily solved:\n\n$\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k\\lambda^2 T$.\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n$T(t) = C_1 e^{-k\\lambda^2 t}$.\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation:\n\n$\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda^2 X$.\n\nThis is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator, and its solutions are:\n\n$X(x) = C_2 \\cos(\\lambda x) + C_3 \\sin(\\lambda x)$.\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) $T(0,t) = 100 \\Rightarrow X(0)T(t) = 100 \\Rightarrow X(0) = C_2 = \\frac{100}{C_1}$.\n\n2) $T(1,t) = 300 \\Rightarrow X(1)T(t) = 300 \\Rightarrow X(1) = \\frac{100}{C_1} \\cos(\\lambda) + \\frac{100}{C_1} \\sin(\\lambda) = 300$.\n\nFrom the second boundary condition, we get:\n\n$\\cos(\\lambda) + \\sin(\\lambda) = 3$.\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier series of the solution:\n\n$T(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n e^{-k\\lambda_n^2 t} \\sin(\\lambda_n x)$.\n\nApplying the initial condition $T(x,0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(\\lambda_n x)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients $A_n$. To do this, we will use the orthogonality property of the sine function:\n\n$\\int_0^1 \\sin(\\lambda_n x) \\sin(\\lambda_m x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta_{mn}$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the initial condition equation by $\\sin(\\lambda_m x)$ and integrating from $0$ to $1$, we get:\n\n$0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\int_0^1 \\sin(\\lambda_n x) \\sin(\\lambda_m x) dx = A_m \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, $A_m = 0$ for all $m$. This means that the temperature function is identically zero, which contradicts the boundary conditions. Therefore, the problem has no solution."
