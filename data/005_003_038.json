    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line for the given data set, we will use the least squares method. The equation of the regression line is given by:\n\nY = a + bX\n\nwhere a is the Y-intercept, b is the slope, X is the independent variable (number of hours students study), and Y is the dependent variable (test scores).\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of X and Y:\n\nMean of X (X̄) = (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 5 = 20 / 5 = 4\nMean of Y (Ȳ) = (70 + 75 + 82 + 90 + 94) / 5 = 411 / 5 = 82.2\n\nNext, we will find the slope (b) using the formula:\n\nb = Σ[(Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ)] / Σ(Xi - X̄)^2\n\nwhere Xi and Yi are the individual data points.\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n(2 - 4)(70 - 82.2) + (3 - 4)(75 - 82.2) + (4 - 4)(82 - 82.2) + (5 - 4)(90 - 82.2) + (6 - 4)(94 - 82.2) = (-2)(-12.2) + (-1)(-7.2) + (0)(-0.2) + (1)(7.8) + (2)(11.8) = 24.4 + 7.2 + 0 + 7.8 + 23.6 = 63\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n(-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + (0)^2 + (1)^2 + (2)^2 = 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 10\n\nNow, we can find the slope (b):\n\nb = 63 / 10 = 6.3\n\nTo find the Y-intercept (a), we will use the formula:\n\na = Ȳ - bX̄\n\na = 82.2 - 6.3(4) = 82.2 - 25.2 = 57\n\nNow, we have the equation of the regression line:\n\nY = 57 + 6.3X"
