    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(5x+1) + 2 = 7, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\nSubtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n√(5x+1) = 5\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(5x+1))^2 = 5^2\n\n5x + 1 = 25\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n5x = 24\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 24/5\n\nSo, the solution is x = 24/5."
