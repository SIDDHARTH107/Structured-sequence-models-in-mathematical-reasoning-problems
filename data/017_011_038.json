    "message_2": "To find the distinct groups of order 12 up to isomorphism, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 4 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFor n_2, the possible values are 1 and 3. For n_3, the only possible value is 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are normal, their product forms a group of order 12, which is the cyclic group C12.\n\n2. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The unique Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, and the Sylow 2-subgroups are isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. The semidirect product of V4 and the Sylow 3-subgroup (isomorphic to C3) can form two non-isomorphic groups: the dihedral group D6 and the alternating group A4.\n\nSo, there are three distinct groups of order 12 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. Cyclic group C12\n2. Alternating group A4\n3. Dihedral group D6"
