    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 72 and 120 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (120) by the smaller number (72) and find the remainder.\n   120 รท 72 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 48.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (120) with the smaller number (72) and the smaller number with the remainder (48), and repeat the process.\n   72 รท 48 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 24.\n\n3. Continue this process until the remainder is 0.\n   48 รท 24 = 2 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 24.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 120 is 24."
