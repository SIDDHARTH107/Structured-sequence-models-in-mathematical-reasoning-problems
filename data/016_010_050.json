    "message_1": "In the Apollonian gasket construction, if we start with three touching circles with radii 1, 2, and 3, how many circles will be added in the fourth generation of the gasket?",
    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the gaps between touching circles with new circles that are tangent to the three surrounding circles. The process starts with three mutually tangent circles, and the circles added in each generation are called \"descendants.\"\n\nTo find the number of circles added in the fourth generation, we need to understand the pattern of how many circles are added in each generation. Let's denote the number of circles added in the nth generation as C_n.\n\n1. First generation (C_1): We start with three mutually tangent circles with radii 1, 2, and 3. We can add one circle tangent to all three of them. So, C_1 = 1.\n\n2. Second generation (C_2): For each of the four circles from the first generation, we can add a new circle tangent to that circle and two of the original circles. However, the new circle added in the first generation has already been counted twice, so we subtract one to avoid double-counting. Therefore, C_2 = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\n3. Third generation (C_3): For each of the seven circles from the first and second generations, we can add a new circle tangent to that circle and two others. However, the three new circles added in the second generation have already been counted twice, so we subtract three to avoid double-counting. Therefore, C_3 = 7 - 3 = 4.\n\nNow, we can find the number of circles added in the fourth generation (C_4):\n\n4. Fourth generation (C_4): For each of the eleven circles from the first, second, and third generations, we can add a new circle tangent to that circle and two others. However, the four new circles added in the third generation have already been counted twice, so we subtract four to avoid double-counting. Therefore, C_4 = 11 - 4 = 7.\n\nSo, in the fourth generation of the Apollonian gasket, 7 circles will be added."
