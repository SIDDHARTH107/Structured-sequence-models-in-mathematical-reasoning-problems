    "message_2": "To find the expected number of a specific type of song being performed, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number = Probability of the event * Total number of events\n\nIn this case, the probability of the specific type of song being performed is 0.3, and there are 15 songs in total. So, the expected number of this specific type of song to be performed is:\n\nExpected number = 0.3 * 15 = 4.5\n\nSo, we can expect 4.5 of this specific type of song to be performed during the concert. Since it's not possible to have half a song, this means that there will likely be around 4 or 5 of this specific type of song performed."
