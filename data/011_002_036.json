    "message_2": "To choose a committee of 5 people from a group of 12 people, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (12 in this case) and k is the number of people we want to choose (5 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!(12-5)!)\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!7!)\n\nC(12, 5) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(12, 5) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(12, 5) = 95040 / 120\n\nC(12, 5) = 792\n\nSo there are 792 ways to choose a committee of 5 people from a group of 12 people."
