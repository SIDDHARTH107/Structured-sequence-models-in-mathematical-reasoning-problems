    "message_1": "A city has 50 neighborhoods, with 25 having a high rate of property crime. If a person were to randomly select one of the neighborhoods, what is the probability that they select one with a high rate of property crime?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a neighborhood with a high rate of property crime, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of neighborhoods with a high rate of property crime, which is 25. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of neighborhoods, which is 50.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a neighborhood with a high rate of property crime is:\n\nProbability = 25 / 50\n\nProbability = 0.5 or 50%\n\nTherefore, there is a 50% chance that a person will randomly select a neighborhood with a high rate of property crime."
