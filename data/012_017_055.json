    "message_2": "To determine if G has a perfect matching, we can use Tutte's theorem, which states that a graph G has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of its vertices, the number of odd components in the subgraph G - U is less than or equal to |U|.\n\nFirst, let's check if the graph G has an even number of vertices. Since G has 8 vertices, it satisfies this condition.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario for the subset U. If we choose the largest possible subset U, it will have 4 vertices. In this case, the subgraph G - U will have 4 vertices left. The maximum number of odd components in G - U is 2 (two components with 1 vertex each and one component with 2 vertices). Since the number of odd components (2) is less than or equal to the size of the subset U (4), Tutte's theorem holds, and G has a perfect matching.\n\nTo provide one such perfect matching, we need more information about the specific connections between the vertices in G. However, we can guarantee that a perfect matching exists based on Tutte's theorem."
