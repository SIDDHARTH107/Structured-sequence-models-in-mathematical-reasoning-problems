    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum number of edges in a graph with 10 vertices without any cycles. This can be done using the formula for a tree: E = V - 1, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. In this case, E = 10 - 1 = 9.\n\n2. Since graph G has 15 edges, there must be at least 15 - 9 = 6 additional edges that form cycles.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine the minimum number of vertices required to form a cycle with these 6 additional edges. The shortest cycle is a triangle, which requires 3 vertices and 3 edges. Therefore, we can form two triangles with the 6 additional edges.\n\n4. Since the shortest cycle in graph G is a triangle, the girth of the graph G is 3."
