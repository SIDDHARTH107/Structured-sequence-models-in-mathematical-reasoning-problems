    "message_2": "To solve the non-homogeneous system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate y from the first and second equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1, then subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(3x + 3y + 3z) - (3x - y + 2z) = (18 - 4)\n3y + z - (-y + 2z) = 14\n4y - z = 14 (1)\n\nNow, we will eliminate y from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -3 and the third equation by 1, then add the first equation to the third equation:\n\n(-3x - 3y - 3z) + (2x + 3y - z) = (-18 + 7)\n-x - 4z = -11 (2)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables (z and y):\n\n4y - z = 14 (1)\n-x - 4z = -11 (2)\n\nWe will eliminate z from these two equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 1, then add the first equation to the second equation:\n\n(16y - 4z) + (-x - 4z) = (56 - 11)\n-x + 16y = 45 (3)\n\nNow, we will solve equation (3) for x:\n\nx = 16y - 45\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for x back into the first equation:\n\nx + y + z = 6\n(16y - 45) + y + z = 6\n17y - 45 + z = 6\n17y + z = 51\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for z back into equation (1):\n\n4y - z = 14\n4y - (17y - 51) = 14\n4y - 17y + 51 = 14\n-13y = -37\n\nNow, we will solve for y:\n\ny = 37/13\ny = 3\n\nNow, we will substitute this value of y back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 16y - 45\nx = 16(3) - 45\nx = 48 - 45\nx = 3\n\nNow, we will substitute this value of y back into the expression for z:\n\n17y + z = 51\n17(3) + z = 51\n51 + z = 51\nz = 0\n\nNow, we have the values for x, y, and z:\n\nx = 3\ny = 3\nz = 0\n\nFinally, we will find the value of x + 2y - z:\n\nx + 2y - z = 3 + 2(3) - 0 = 3 + 6 = 9."
