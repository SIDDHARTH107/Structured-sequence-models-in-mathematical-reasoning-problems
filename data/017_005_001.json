    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say H, of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have that n_3 divides |G|/3^3 = 1 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 = 1, which means that H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the center Z(G) of G. Since G is a p-group (with p = 3), we know that Z(G) is nontrivial, i.e., |Z(G)| > 1. The possible orders of Z(G) are 3, 9, or 27. We will consider each case:\n\nCase 1: |Z(G)| = 27\nIn this case, Z(G) = G, which means that G is an abelian group. Since G is of order 27, it must be a direct product of its Sylow 3-subgroups. Thus, G is isomorphic to either C_27 (cyclic group of order 27) or C_3 × C_9 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3 and 9).\n\nCase 2: |Z(G)| = 9\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 3, which must be cyclic (isomorphic to C_3). By the Correspondence Theorem, there exists a normal subgroup K of G such that K/Z(G) is isomorphic to C_3. Since |K| = 9, K is a normal subgroup of G of order 9. Now, G can be written as a direct product of K and a subgroup of order 3 (since gcd(3, 9) = 1). Thus, G is isomorphic to C_3 × C_9.\n\nCase 3: |Z(G)| = 3\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 9. Since any group of order 9 is abelian (either C_9 or C_3 × C_3), G/Z(G) is abelian. However, this case cannot happen, because if G/Z(G) is abelian, then G must be abelian, which contradicts our assumption that |Z(G)| = 3.\n\nTherefore, G must be either cyclic (isomorphic to C_27) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (C_3 × C_9)."
