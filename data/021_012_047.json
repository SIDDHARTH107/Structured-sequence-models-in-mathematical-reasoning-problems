    "message_2": "The quasi-Newton method is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum or maximum of a function. It is an iterative method that updates an approximation of the inverse Hessian matrix to find the minimum or maximum point. To apply the quasi-Newton method, we first need to find the gradient (first derivative) and the Hessian (second derivative) of the function f(x).\n\nGiven the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x + 4, let's find its first and second derivatives:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x + 3\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 24x - 24\n\nNow, let's apply the quasi-Newton method. We will use the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, which is a popular quasi-Newton method. The BFGS algorithm requires an initial guess for the minimum point, so let's start with x0 = 0.\n\n1. Initialize x0, the inverse Hessian approximation B0, and set the iteration counter k = 0.\n2. Compute the gradient at x0: g0 = f'(x0) = 12(0)^3 - 12(0)^2 - 24(0) + 3 = 3\n3. Choose a search direction: p0 = -B0 * g0 = -1 * 3 = -3\n4. Perform a line search to find an optimal step size αk that minimizes f(x0 + αk * p0).\n5. Update the estimate of the minimum point: x1 = x0 + αk * p0\n6. Compute the gradient at x1: g1 = f'(x1)\n7. Update the inverse Hessian approximation B1 using the BFGS update formula.\n8. Set k = k + 1 and repeat steps 3-7 until convergence.\n\nThe BFGS algorithm is an iterative process, and the convergence can be checked by looking at the difference between consecutive estimates of the minimum point or the gradient's norm. The actual implementation of the BFGS algorithm requires a line search method and a stopping criterion, which are beyond the scope of this answer.\n\nHowever, you can use optimization libraries in programming languages like Python (using the scipy.optimize package) to find the global minimum of the function using the BFGS algorithm."
