    "message_2": "To find the geodesic on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 passing through the points (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 1), we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation. The arc length of a curve on the surface can be expressed as:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 + (∂z/∂y)^2) ds\n\nwhere ds is the differential arc length along the curve. For the given surface, we have:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, let's parameterize the curve on the surface by a parameter t:\n\nx = x(t)\ny = y(t)\nz = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2\n\nThe arc length can be expressed in terms of t:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (2x(t)x'(t))^2 + (2y(t)y'(t))^2) dt\n\nWe want to minimize this arc length. To do this, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\nd(∂L/∂x')/dt - ∂L/∂x = 0\nd(∂L/∂y')/dt - ∂L/∂y = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nx'(t) = C1 / (1 + 4x(t)^2)\ny'(t) = C2 / (1 + 4y(t)^2)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are constants. Integrating these equations, we get:\n\nx(t) = (1/2) * tanh(C1*t + C3)\ny(t) = (1/2) * tanh(C2*t + C4)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants C1, C2, C3, and C4 such that the curve passes through the points (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 1) and has a total length of 4 units. We can do this by setting up a system of equations:\n\n1. x(0) = 1\n2. y(0) = 0\n3. x(T) = -1, where T is the parameter value at the endpoint\n4. y(T) = 0\n5. L = 4\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nC1 = 0\nC2 = 1\nC3 = 0\nC4 = 0\nT = 2 * arctanh(2)\n\nThus, the geodesic curve on the surface is given by:\n\nx(t) = (1/2) * tanh(t)\ny(t) = 0\n\nThis curve passes through the points (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 1) and has a total length of 4 units."
