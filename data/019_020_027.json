    "message_2": "To determine the time complexity of a sorting algorithm, we need to find the relationship between the input size (n) and the number of steps (or operations) required to sort the input. In this case, we are given that the algorithm takes 2000 steps to sort an input of size 100.\n\nLet's assume the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^k), where k is a constant. We can set up an equation to find the value of k:\n\n2000 = C * (100^k)\n\nwhere C is a constant factor.\n\nUnfortunately, with only one data point, we cannot uniquely determine the values of C and k. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common sorting algorithms:\n\n1. If the algorithm is linear, i.e., O(n), then k = 1. In this case, C = 2000/100 = 20.\n2. If the algorithm is quadratic, i.e., O(n^2), then k = 2. In this case, C = 2000/(100^2) = 0.2.\n3. If the algorithm is logarithmic, i.e., O(n*log(n)), then k is not an integer, and we cannot directly determine the value of C.\n\nWithout more information, it is not possible to definitively determine the time complexity of the sorting algorithm. However, the given information suggests that the algorithm is likely to be either linear or quadratic, as these are common time complexities for sorting algorithms."
