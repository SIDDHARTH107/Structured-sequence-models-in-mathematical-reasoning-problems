Find the points on this variety in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ with coordinates $(x:y:z)$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are not all zero, and each of them has absolute value at most 10.",
    "message_2": "To find the points on the projective variety, we need to find all the triples $(x, y, z)$ such that $x^3 - 2y^3 + 3z^3 = 0$ and $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with absolute value at most 10. Since the equation is homogeneous, we can assume that $x, y, z$ are coprime integers.\n\nWe can start by iterating through all possible values of $x, y, z$ in the range $-10 \\leq x, y, z \\leq 10$ and checking if the equation holds. Note that we exclude the case when $x = y = z = 0$.\n\nHere is a list of points that satisfy the given conditions:\n\n1. $(x:y:z) = (1:1:-1)$, since $1^3 - 2(1)^3 + 3(-1)^3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 0$.\n2. $(x:y:z) = (1:-1:1)$, since $1^3 - 2(-1)^3 + 3(1)^3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 0$.\n3. $(x:y:z) = (-1:1:1)$, since $(-1)^3 - 2(1)^3 + 3(1)^3 = -1 - 2 + 3 = 0$.\n4. $(x:y:z) = (-1:-1:-1)$, since $(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^3 = -1 + 2 - 3 = 0$.\n\nThese are the only points on the projective variety with coordinates in $\\mathbb{Q}$ and absolute value at most 10."
