    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the car at t=2 seconds, we need to find the first and second derivatives of the position function x(t) with respect to time t.\n\nThe position function is given by x(t) = 3t^2 - 4t + 10.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative of x(t) with respect to t, which represents the velocity function v(t):\n\nv(t) = dx/dt = d(3t^2 - 4t + 10)/dt = 6t - 4.\n\nNow, we find the second derivative of x(t) with respect to t, which represents the acceleration function a(t):\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t - 4)/dt = 6.\n\nNow, we can find the velocity and acceleration of the car at t=2 seconds by plugging t=2 into the velocity and acceleration functions:\n\nv(2) = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.\na(2) = 6.\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at t=2 seconds is 8 m/s, and the acceleration is 6 m/sÂ²."
