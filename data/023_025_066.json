Find the complex Fourier coefficient of the corresponding frequency-domain electric field E(ω) in the material. Here, ω is the angular frequency in radians/second.",
    "message_2": "To find the complex Fourier coefficient of the corresponding frequency-domain electric field E(ω), we first need to find the Fourier transform of the time-domain electric field E(t).\n\nGiven E(t) = 2cos(2π10^9t) V/m, we can rewrite it as:\n\nE(t) = cos(ωt) + cos(ωt), where ω = 2π10^9 rad/s.\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of E(t):\n\nE(ω) = ∫[cos(ωt) + cos(ωt)]e^(-jωt) dt\n\nSince the Fourier transform of cos(ωt) is (1/2)[δ(ω - ω₀) + δ(ω + ω₀)], where δ is the Dirac delta function and ω₀ is the frequency of the cosine function, we can write the Fourier transform of E(t) as:\n\nE(ω) = (1/2)[δ(ω - 2π10^9) + δ(ω + 2π10^9)] + (1/2)[δ(ω - 2π10^9) + δ(ω + 2π10^9)]\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\nE(ω) = [δ(ω - 2π10^9) + δ(ω + 2π10^9)]\n\nNow, we need to find the complex Fourier coefficient of the corresponding frequency-domain electric field E(ω) in the material with dielectric constant ε = 3.\n\nThe relationship between the time-domain electric field E(t) and the frequency-domain electric field E(ω) in the material is given by:\n\nE_material(ω) = E(ω) / √ε\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nE_material(ω) = [δ(ω - 2π10^9) + δ(ω + 2π10^9)] / √3\n\nSo, the complex Fourier coefficient of the corresponding frequency-domain electric field E(ω) in the material is:\n\nE_material(ω) = (1/√3)[δ(ω - 2π10^9) + δ(ω + 2π10^9)]"
