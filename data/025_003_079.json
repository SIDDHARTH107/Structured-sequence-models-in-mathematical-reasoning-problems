    "message_2": "To determine if the point $[1:1:1]$ belongs to the projective variety $V$, we need to check if it satisfies all the defining equations of $V$. The defining equations of $V$ are:\n\n1. $x_0^2 - x_1x_2 = 0$\n2. $x_1^2 - x_0x_2 = 0$\n3. $x_2^2 - x_0x_1 = 0$\n\nNow, let's substitute the coordinates of the point $[1:1:1]$ into these equations:\n\n1. $(1)^2 - (1)(1) = 1 - 1 = 0$\n2. $(1)^2 - (1)(1) = 1 - 1 = 0$\n3. $(1)^2 - (1)(1) = 1 - 1 = 0$\n\nSince the point $[1:1:1]$ satisfies all the defining equations of the projective variety $V$, it belongs to $V$."
