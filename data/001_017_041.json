    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+8) - log2(x+2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the subtraction property of logarithms, which states that logb(m) - logb(n) = logb(m/n). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog2((x+8)/(x+2)) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form. The definition of logarithms states that logb(x) = y if and only if b^y = x. In our case, this means:\n\n2^2 = (x+8)/(x+2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4 = (x+8)/(x+2)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by (x+2):\n\n4(x+2) = x+8\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n4x + 8 = x + 8\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n3x = 0\n\nDividing by 3, we find:\n\nx = 0"
