Prove that there exists at least one element a in G such that the subgroup generated by a has order 3, and that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27 depending on whether this element a commutes with all other elements or not, respectively.",
    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a subgroup H of G with order 3. Let a be an element in H such that a is not the identity element. Then, the order of a must be 3, as H is a group of order 3. Thus, we have found an element a in G such that the subgroup generated by a has order 3.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIf G is abelian, then every element in G commutes with every other element, including a. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C27, C3 × C9, or C3 × C3 × C3. However, since there exists an element of order 3 (namely, a), G cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C3 × C3. Additionally, G cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C9, as this would imply that there exists an element of order 9 in G, which would contradict the existence of a subgroup of order 3. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIf G is non-abelian, then there exists at least one element b in G such that a does not commute with b (i.e., ab ≠ ba). Let K be the subgroup generated by b. Since the order of G is 27 and the order of a is 3, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of K must be a divisor of 27. The possible orders for K are 1, 3, 9, and 27. If the order of K is 1 or 3, then K is a subgroup of H, which is a contradiction since a and b do not commute. If the order of K is 27, then K = G, which implies that G is cyclic, contradicting the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, the order of K must be 9.\n\nNow, consider the set S = {a^i * b^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ 2, 0 ≤ j ≤ 8}. Since a and b do not commute, the elements in S are distinct, and there are 3 * 9 = 27 elements in S. Thus, S = G. Define a multiplication operation on S by (a^i * b^j)(a^k * b^l) = a^(i+k) * b^(j+l). This operation is well-defined and makes S a group isomorphic to G. Since a does not commute with at least one element in G, G is non-abelian and isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists an element a in G such that the subgroup generated by a has order 3, and that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27 depending on whether this element a commutes with all other elements or not, respectively."
