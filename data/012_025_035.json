    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph that visits each vertex exactly once. In the given graph with 5 vertices arranged in a pentagon shape, we can find a Hamiltonian cycle as follows:\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E in clockwise order.\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian cycle is: A → B → C → D → E → A\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex A, forming a closed loop."
