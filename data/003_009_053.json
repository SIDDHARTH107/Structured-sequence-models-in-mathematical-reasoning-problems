    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 5 cm and 7 cm. The included angle between these sides is 60 degrees. Find the perimeter of the triangle.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two known sides, C is the included angle between them, and c is the length of the unknown side.\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and C = 60 degrees.\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(60)\nc² = 25 + 49 - 70 * 0.5\nc² = 74 - 35\nc² = 39\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √39\nc ≈ 6.24 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the third side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 5 + 7 + 6.24\nPerimeter ≈ 18.24 cm"
