    "message_2": "The sparse matrix method is not the most suitable method for solving this system of linear equations, as it is mainly used for matrices with a large number of zero elements. However, we can solve this system using the Gaussian elimination method or the matrix inversion method. Here, I will use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2  5  1 |  7 ]\n[ 2  3  4 | 11 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nSubtract the first row from the second row multiplied by 2, and subtract the first row from the third row multiplied by 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  3  -1 | -5 ]\n[ 0  1  2 | -1 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nSubtract the second row divided by 3 from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  3  -1 | -5 ]\n[ 0  0  5/3 | 4/3 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nDivide the third row by (5/3) to get z:\n\n```\nz = (4/3) / (5/3) = 4/5\n```\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nSubstitute z back into the second row and solve for y:\n\n```\n3y - 4/5 = -5\n3y = -5 + 4/5\n3y = -21/5\ny = -7/5\n```\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nSubstitute y and z back into the first row and solve for x:\n\n```\nx - 7/5 + 4/5 = 6\nx = 6 + 7/5 - 4/5\nx = 6 + 3/5\nx = 33/5\n```\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 33/5\ny = -7/5\nz = 4/5\n```"
