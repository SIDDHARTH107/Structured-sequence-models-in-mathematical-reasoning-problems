    "message_2": "In epistemic logic, we use the \"K\" operator to represent knowledge. So, if we want to say that John knows that it will rain tomorrow, we write K_J(R), where K_J represents John's knowledge and R represents the proposition \"it will rain tomorrow.\"\n\nThe statement also says that Mary knows that John knows that it will rain tomorrow. We can represent this as K_M(K_J(R)), where K_M represents Mary's knowledge.\n\nNow, we want to determine if Mary knows that it will rain tomorrow, which would be represented as K_M(R).\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n\n1. K_J(R) - John knows that it will rain tomorrow.\n2. K_M(K_J(R)) - Mary knows that John knows that it will rain tomorrow.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer K_M(R) - Mary knows that it will rain tomorrow - from the given information. Epistemic logic does not guarantee that if an agent knows that another agent knows a fact, then the first agent also knows the fact. This would require additional axioms or assumptions about the relationship between John's and Mary's knowledge.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot determine if Mary knows that it will rain tomorrow."
