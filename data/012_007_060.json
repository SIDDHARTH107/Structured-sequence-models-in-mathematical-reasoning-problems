The following table shows the maximum capacity of goods flow that can be transported between these cities:\n\n|  | A | B | C | D |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 0 | 4 | 5 | 0 |\n| B | 0 | 0 | 3 | 4 |\n| C | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |\n| D | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nIf we want to transport goods from city A to city D, what is the maximum amount of goods that can be transported per unit time?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from city A to city D, we need to find the bottleneck capacity in the network. We can do this by analyzing the possible paths from A to D and finding the minimum capacity in each path.\n\nThere are two possible paths from A to D:\n\n1. A → B → C → D\n2. A → B → D\n\nFor path 1 (A → B → C → D):\n- A to B has a capacity of 4\n- B to C has a capacity of 3\n- C to D has a capacity of 3\n\nThe bottleneck capacity for this path is the minimum capacity, which is 3.\n\nFor path 2 (A → B → D):\n- A to B has a capacity of 4\n- B to D has a capacity of 4\n\nThe bottleneck capacity for this path is the minimum capacity, which is 4.\n\nSince path 2 has a higher bottleneck capacity, the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from city A to city D per unit time is 4."
