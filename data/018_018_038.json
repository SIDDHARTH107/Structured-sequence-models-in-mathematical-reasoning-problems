    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference of A and B (A Δ B):\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A (B Δ A):\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection are commutative, we can use the same values we found earlier:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of A and B is the same as the symmetric difference of B and A:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 2, 6, 7}"
