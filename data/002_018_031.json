    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches all six faces of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. In this case, the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm. \n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius is 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nSubstitute the radius into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3)^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(27)\n\nV = 36π cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube with an edge length of 6 cm is 36π cubic centimeters."
