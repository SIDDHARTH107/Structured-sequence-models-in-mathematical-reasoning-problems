    "message_1": "A car is driving on a straight road and the driver wants to measure the distance between two buildings. The car is currently at point A and the two buildings are located at point B and point C. The driver measures the angle of elevation from point A to point B as 35° and the angle of elevation from point A to point C as 52°. If the distance between the two buildings is 100 meters, what is the distance between point A and each building?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between point A and building B as x, and the distance between point A and building C as y. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles of elevation to the distances between the points.\n\nLet's denote the height of building B as h1 and the height of building C as h2. Then, we have:\n\ntan(35°) = h1/x\ntan(52°) = h2/y\n\nSince the distance between the two buildings is 100 meters, we can write the height difference between the two buildings as:\n\nh2 - h1 = 100\n\nNow, we can express h1 and h2 in terms of x and y using the tangent equations:\n\nh1 = x * tan(35°)\nh2 = y * tan(52°)\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the height difference equation:\n\ny * tan(52°) - x * tan(35°) = 100\n\nNow, we have one equation with two variables, x and y. To solve for x and y, we need another equation. We can use the fact that the angle between the line connecting point A to point B and the line connecting point A to point C is a straight angle (180°). Therefore, the angle between the lines connecting point A to point B and point A to point C is 180° - 35° - 52° = 93°.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we can write:\n\n100^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy * cos(93°)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\n1) y * tan(52°) - x * tan(35°) = 100\n2) 100^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy * cos(93°)\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx ≈ 152.62 meters\ny ≈ 88.54 meters\n\nTherefore, the distance between point A and building B is approximately 152.62 meters, and the distance between point A and building C is approximately 88.54 meters."
