    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nHere, we set the separation constant to $-\\lambda$ since we are dealing with a boundary value problem. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $T'(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$\n2. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$$T(t) = Ce^{-\\lambda t}$$\n\nFor the second equation, we have different cases depending on the value of $\\lambda$:\n\n1. $\\lambda = 0$: In this case, $X(x) = Ax + B$. But since $u(0,t) = 0$, we have $X(0) = 0$, which implies $B = 0$. So, $X(x) = Ax$.\n\n2. $\\lambda > 0$: In this case, $X(x) = A\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. Again, using the boundary condition $u(0,t) = 0$, we get $X(0) = 0$, which implies $A = 0$. So, $X(x) = B\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$.\n\n3. $\\lambda < 0$: In this case, $X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x)$. Using the boundary condition $u(0,t) = 0$, we get $X(0) = 0$, which implies $A = 0$. So, $X(x) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x)$.\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the initial condition $u(x,0) = x$. This implies that $X(x)T(0) = x$. Since $T(0) = C$, we have $X(x) = x$. This is only possible in the third case, i.e., $\\lambda < 0$. So, we have:\n\n$$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\n$$T_n(t) = C_ne^{-n^2\\pi^2 t}$$\n\nNow, we can write the solution as a sum of these individual solutions:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)C_ne^{-n^2\\pi^2 t}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $B_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = x$:\n\n$$x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nUsing Fourier sine series, we can find $B_n$:\n\n$$B_n = \\frac{2}{L}\\int_0^L x\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) dx$$\n\nIn our case, $L = 1$. So,\n\n$$B_n = 2\\int_0^1 x\\sin(n\\pi x) dx$$\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\n$$B_n = \\frac{2((-1)^n-1)}{n^2\\pi^2}$$\n\nFinally, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{2((-1)^n-1)}{n^2\\pi^2}\\sin(n\\pi x)e^{-n^2\\pi^2 t}$$"
