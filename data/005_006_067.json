    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 850 hours, the population standard deviation (σ) is 15 hours, and the sample size (n) is 90.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample means (σ_sample):\n\nσ_sample = σ / √n\nσ_sample = 15 / √90\nσ_sample ≈ 1.58 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the range (845 and 855 hours, respectively):\n\nz_lower = (X_lower - μ) / σ_sample\nz_lower = (845 - 850) / 1.58\nz_lower ≈ -3.16\n\nz_upper = (X_upper - μ) / σ_sample\nz_upper = (855 - 850) / 1.58\nz_upper ≈ 3.16\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability between these z-scores. The probability of a z-score being between -3.16 and 3.16 is approximately 0.9993.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the average lifespan of the sample will be between 845 and 855 hours is approximately 99.93%."
