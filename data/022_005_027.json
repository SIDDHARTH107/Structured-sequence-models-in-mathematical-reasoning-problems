    "message_2": "To find the residues of f(z) at z = 0 and z = 2, we first need to identify the order of the poles at these points.\n\nWe can factor the denominator of f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - 6z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z(z^2 - 6))\n\nNow, we can see that there is a simple pole at z = 0 (since the power of z in the denominator is 1) and a double pole at z = 2 (since the power of (z^2 - 6) in the denominator is 2).\n\n1. Residue at z = 0:\n\nSince there is a simple pole at z = 0, we can directly find the residue by multiplying f(z) by z and taking the limit as z approaches 0:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = lim (z -> 0) [z * (z^2 + 1)/(z(z^2 - 6))] = lim (z -> 0) [(z^2 + 1)/(z^2 - 6)]\n\nAs z approaches 0, the residue becomes:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = (0^2 + 1)/(0^2 - 6) = 1/(-6) = -1/6\n\n2. Residue at z = 2:\n\nSince there is a double pole at z = 2, we need to find the first derivative of the function g(z) = (z^2 + 1)/((z^2 - 6)) and then multiply it by (z - 2) and take the limit as z approaches 2:\n\ng(z) = (z^2 + 1)/((z^2 - 6))\ng'(z) = (2z(z^2 - 6) - (z^2 + 1)(2z))/(z^2 - 6)^2\n\nNow, we find the residue:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 2] = lim (z -> 2) [(z - 2) * g'(z)] = lim (z -> 2) [(z - 2) * (2z(z^2 - 6) - (z^2 + 1)(2z))/(z^2 - 6)^2]\n\nAs z approaches 2, the residue becomes:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 2] = (2 - 2) * (2*2(2^2 - 6) - (2^2 + 1)(2*2))/((2^2 - 6)^2) = 0\n\nSo, the residues of f(z) at z = 0 and z = 2 are:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 0] = -1/6\nRes[f(z), z = 2] = 0"
