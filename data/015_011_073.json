    "message_2": "To find the maximum angle achieved by the first pendulum, we need to consider the conservation of energy in the system. The total energy of the double pendulum system is given as 10 Joules. The initial potential energy (PE) of the first pendulum can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPE = m * g * h\n\nwhere m is the mass of the pendulum, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and h is the vertical height of the pendulum's center of mass above its lowest point.\n\nSince the length of both pendulums is 0.5 meters, the initial height of the first pendulum can be calculated using the initial angle (30 degrees) and the length:\n\nh_initial = 0.5 * (1 - cos(30°))\n\nh_initial ≈ 0.0669873 meters\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of the pendulum. We can do this by rearranging the potential energy formula:\n\nm = PE / (g * h_initial)\n\nSince the total energy is given as 10 Joules, and we assume that all of this energy is initially stored as potential energy in the first pendulum:\n\nm ≈ 10 / (9.81 * 0.0669873)\nm ≈ 1.517 kg\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height of the first pendulum when it reaches its maximum angle. Since the total energy is conserved, the potential energy at the maximum angle will be equal to the initial potential energy:\n\nPE_max = m * g * h_max\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for h_max:\n\nh_max = PE_max / (m * g)\nh_max ≈ 10 / (1.517 * 9.81)\nh_max ≈ 0.685 meters\n\nNow, we can find the maximum angle using the maximum height and the length of the pendulum:\n\ncos(angle_max) = (0.5 - h_max) / 0.5\n\nangle_max = arccos((0.5 - 0.685) / 0.5)\nangle_max ≈ 131.81°\n\nSo, the maximum angle achieved by the first pendulum of the double pendulum system is approximately 131.81 degrees."
