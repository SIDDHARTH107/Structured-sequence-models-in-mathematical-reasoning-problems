    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve E(F_31), we will use the Hasse's theorem. Hasse's theorem states that if E is an elliptic curve over a finite field F_q, then the number of points N on E(F_q) satisfies the following inequality:\n\nq + 1 - 2√q ≤ N ≤ q + 1 + 2√q\n\nIn our case, q = 31, so we have:\n\n31 + 1 - 2√31 ≤ N ≤ 31 + 1 + 2√31\n\nNow, we will check all the points in F_31 to see if they satisfy the equation of the elliptic curve E:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 (mod 31)\n\nWe will count the number of points that satisfy this equation, and then add 1 for the point at infinity, which is always on the elliptic curve.\n\nHere is the list of points that satisfy the equation:\n\n(0, 5), (0, 26), (1, 12), (1, 19), (2, 7), (2, 24), (3, 1), (3, 30), (4, 11), (4, 20), (5, 17), (5, 14), (6, 8), (6, 23), (7, 6), (7, 25), (9, 4), (9, 27), (10, 3), (10, 28), (11, 21), (11, 10), (12, 18), (12, 13), (13, 15), (13, 16), (16, 2), (16, 29), (17, 9), (17, 22), (20, 0)\n\nThere are 31 points in this list. Adding 1 for the point at infinity, we have a total of 32 points on E(F_31)."
