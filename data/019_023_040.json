    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can't predict the exact probability of the basketball player making their next free throw based on their past performance alone. However, I can provide an estimation based on their current success rate.\n\nThe basketball player has made 8 out of 10 free throws, which means their success rate so far is:\n\n8 successful free throws / 10 total free throws = 0.8 or 80%\n\nBased on their past performance, we can estimate that there is an 80% probability that they will make their next free throw. Keep in mind that this is just an estimation and not a guarantee, as many factors can influence the outcome of a free throw attempt."
