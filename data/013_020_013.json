    "message_1": "Assuming that there are 100 participants in a beauty contest and each player aims to guess what the average of all the guesses will be, determine the highest possible winning strategy so that the player can win the game.",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we have 100 participants, and each participant is trying to guess the average of all the guesses. Let's denote the average of all the guesses as A. Since the participants are trying to guess the average, their guesses will be in the range of 0 to 100.\n\nNow, let's consider the highest possible winning strategy. If all participants guess the maximum value of 100, the average A will be 100. However, if everyone guesses 100, then no one will win, as the average will be equal to the highest guess.\n\nTo find the highest possible winning strategy, we need to consider a situation where one participant guesses a value slightly lower than the maximum value. Let's say this participant guesses 99. In this case, the other 99 participants would need to guess values such that the average of all the guesses is 99.\n\nLet G be the sum of the guesses of the other 99 participants. Then, we have:\n\n(G + 99) / 100 = 99\n\nSolving for G, we get:\n\nG = 100 * 99 - 99\nG = 9900\n\nNow, we need to distribute this sum among the other 99 participants. Since we want the highest possible winning strategy, we should aim to have as many participants as possible guess the maximum value of 100. Let's say there are x participants who guess 100. Then, the remaining (99 - x) participants will guess some value less than 100.\n\nWe can write the equation:\n\n100x + y * (99 - x) = 9900\n\nwhere y is the average guess of the remaining (99 - x) participants.\n\nWe want to maximize x, so let's find the largest possible integer value for x that satisfies the equation:\n\n100x + y * (99 - x) = 9900\n100x + 99y - xy = 9900\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\nxy - 99y = 100x - 9900\n\nNow, we can try different integer values for x and see which one gives us the largest possible x and a valid integer value for y.\n\nFor x = 98:\n98y - 99y = 100 * 98 - 9900\n-y = 9800 - 9900\ny = 100\n\nThis gives us a valid integer value for y. So, the highest possible winning strategy is for one participant to guess 99, 98 participants to guess 100, and the remaining participant to guess 100. In this case, the average of all the guesses will be 99, and the participant who guessed 99 will win the game."
