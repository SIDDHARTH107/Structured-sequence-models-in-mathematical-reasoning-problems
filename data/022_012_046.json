    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n6z - 3 = 0\n6z = 3\nz = 1/2\n\nSo, f(z) has a zero at z = 1/2.\n\nTo find the poles of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz - 2 = 0\nz = 2\n\nSo, f(z) has a pole at z = 2.\n\nNow, let's determine if f(z) is holomorphic at the zero and the pole.\n\nAt the zero (z = 1/2), f(z) is holomorphic because the function is well-defined and differentiable at this point.\n\nAt the pole (z = 2), f(z) is not holomorphic because the function is not well-defined (i.e., the denominator is zero) and not differentiable at this point.\n\nIn summary, f(z) has a zero at z = 1/2 and is holomorphic at this point, and it has a pole at z = 2 and is not holomorphic at this point."
