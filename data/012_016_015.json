    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we first need to understand the structure of the graph. The graph has 6 vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F) and 7 edges. There are two cycles in the graph: one with 3 vertices (A, B, C) and another with 4 vertices (A, D, E, F).\n\nThe Tutte polynomial, T(x, y), can be computed recursively using the following rules:\n\n1. If G is a graph with no edges, then T(G; x, y) = x^(k(G)), where k(G) is the number of connected components in G.\n2. If e is a bridge (cut-edge) in G, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e.\n3. If e is a loop in G, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y).\n4. If e is neither a bridge nor a loop, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y), where G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to compute the Tutte polynomial of the given graph:\n\n1. There are no bridges or loops in the graph, so we can apply rule 4. Let's choose edge AB as e. We have:\n\n   T(G; x, y) = T(G - AB; x, y) + T(G / AB; x, y)\n\n2. In G - AB, edge AC becomes a bridge. Applying rule 2, we get:\n\n   T(G - AB; x, y) = T(G - AB - AC; x, y)\n\n   In G - AB - AC, edge BC becomes a bridge. Applying rule 2 again, we get:\n\n   T(G - AB - AC; x, y) = T(G - AB - AC - BC; x, y)\n\n   Now, G - AB - AC - BC is a graph with 4 connected components, so applying rule 1, we get:\n\n   T(G - AB - AC - BC; x, y) = x^4\n\n3. In G / AB, we contract edge AB, merging vertices A and B into a single vertex, say X. The resulting graph has 5 vertices (X, C, D, E, F) and 6 edges. Edge XC becomes a bridge in this graph. Applying rule 2, we get:\n\n   T(G / AB; x, y) = T(G / AB - XC; x, y)\n\n   In G / AB - XC, edge XF becomes a bridge. Applying rule 2 again, we get:\n\n   T(G / AB - XC; x, y) = T(G / AB - XC - XF; x, y)\n\n   Now, G / AB - XC - XF is a graph with 3 connected components, so applying rule 1, we get:\n\n   T(G / AB - XC - XF; x, y) = x^3\n\n4. Combining the results from steps 2 and 3, we get the Tutte polynomial of the given graph:\n\n   T(G; x, y) = x^4 + x^3"
