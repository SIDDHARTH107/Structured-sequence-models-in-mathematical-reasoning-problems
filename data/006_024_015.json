    "message_1": "A person takes a trip and they can choose to travel by either plane, train or bus. The probability of their luggage being lost when traveling by plane is 0.1, when traveling by train is 0.05, and when traveling by bus is 0.02. What is the probability that if they travel by all 3 modes of transportation, their luggage will be lost at least once?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that their luggage will be lost at least once, we can first find the probability that their luggage will not be lost in any of the modes of transportation, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of their luggage not being lost when traveling by plane is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\nThe probability of their luggage not being lost when traveling by train is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\nThe probability of their luggage not being lost when traveling by bus is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nThe probability that their luggage will not be lost in any of the modes of transportation is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n0.9 * 0.95 * 0.98 = 0.8373\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that their luggage will be lost at least once:\n\n1 - 0.8373 = 0.1627\n\nSo, the probability that their luggage will be lost at least once is 0.1627 or 16.27%."
