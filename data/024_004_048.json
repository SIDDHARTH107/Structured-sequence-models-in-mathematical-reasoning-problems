    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface using the variables u and v:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we need to find the second partial derivatives of r:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = r_uu • N = (2u^2 + 2v^2 - 2) / W\nM = r_uv • N = 0\nN = r_vv • N = (2u^2 + 2v^2 - 2) / W\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface, and W is the magnitude of the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (-2u, -2v, 1)\nW = ||N|| = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/2W^2) * ((2u^2 + 2v^2 - 2)(EG - F^2) - 2FM + (2u^2 + 2v^2 - 2)(EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nH = (1/2(9)) * ((2(2) - 2)(2 - 0) - 0 + (2(2) - 2)(2 - 0))\nH = (1/18) * (4(2) + 4(2))\nH = (1/18) * 16\nH = 8/9\n\nSo, the mean curvature at the point (1, 1, 2) is 8/9."
