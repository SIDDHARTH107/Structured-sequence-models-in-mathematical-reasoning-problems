    "message_1": "Suppose the temperature distribution in a rod of length 10 cm is given by f(x) = 100sin(πx/10). Use the Fourier transform to determine the time-dependent distribution of temperature in the rod when the ends are kept at 0 °C and 100 °C, respectively, and the initial temperature is 50 °C.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or temperature) in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nSince the ends of the rod are kept at 0 °C and 100 °C, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, t) = 0\nu(10, t) = 100\n\nThe initial temperature is given by:\n\nu(x, 0) = 100sin(πx/10) + 50\n\nWe will now use the method of separation of variables to solve the heat equation. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = α X''(x)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we obtain:\n\nT'(t) / αT(t) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on t and the right-hand side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT'(t) / αT(t) = X''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nT'(t) + αλ²T(t) = 0\n\nThe first equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = 0 and X(10) = 0. The solutions are:\n\nX_n(x) = sin(nπx/10), n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nwith corresponding eigenvalues λ_n = nπ/10.\n\nThe second equation is a first-order linear ODE, which has the solution:\n\nT_n(t) = exp(-αλ_n²t), n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow we can write the general solution as a sum of these separated solutions:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [A_n sin(nπx/10) exp(-α(nπ/10)²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = 100sin(πx/10) + 50:\n\n100sin(πx/10) + 50 = Σ [A_n sin(nπx/10)]\n\nWe can find A_n by multiplying both sides by sin(mπx/10) and integrating from 0 to 10:\n\nA_m = (2/10) ∫[0,10] (100sin(πx/10) + 50) sin(mπx/10) dx\n\nUsing the orthogonality of sine functions, we find that A_1 = 100 and A_n = 0 for n ≠ 1. Therefore, the solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = 100 sin(πx/10) exp(-α(π/10)²t)"
