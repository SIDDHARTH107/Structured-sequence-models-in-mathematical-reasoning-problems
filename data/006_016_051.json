    "message_1": "In a manufacturing plant, there is a 2% chance that a product has a certain type of defect. If a batch of 500 products is produced, what is the probability that exactly 10 products will have this defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (defective products in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (number of products produced, which is 500)\n- k is the number of successes (number of defective products, which is 10)\n- p is the probability of success (probability of a product being defective, which is 0.02)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 10) = (500 choose 10) * 0.02^10 * (1-0.02)^(500-10)\n\nFirst, calculate (500 choose 10):\n\n(500 choose 10) = 500! / (10!(500-10)!) = 500! / (10! * 490!)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that (500 choose 10) ≈ 10,272,278,170\n\nNow, calculate 0.02^10:\n\n0.02^10 ≈ 1.024 x 10^(-14)\n\nAnd calculate (1-0.02)^(500-10):\n\n(0.98)^490 ≈ 3.583 x 10^(-7)\n\nFinally, multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 10,272,278,170 * 1.024 x 10^(-14) * 3.583 x 10^(-7)\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.0376\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 products will have this defect in a batch of 500 products is approximately 3.76%."
