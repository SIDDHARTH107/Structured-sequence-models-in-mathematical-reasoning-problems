    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of the graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. (5, 6): 3\n2. (3, 4): 4\n3. (1, 2): 5\n4. (2, 4): 6\n5. (1, 4): 7\n6. (3, 6): 8\n7. (2, 3): 9\n8. (1, 3): 10\n9. (4, 5): 11\n10. (2, 5): 12\n\nNow, we add edges to the minimum spanning tree while ensuring that no cycles are formed:\n\n1. Add (5, 6): 3\n2. Add (3, 4): 4\n3. Add (1, 2): 5\n4. Add (2, 4): 6 (adding this edge will not create a cycle)\n5. Add (3, 6): 8 (adding this edge will not create a cycle)\n\nAt this point, all vertices are included in the minimum spanning tree, so we can stop.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree consists of the following edges and their weights:\n\n- (1, 2): 5\n- (3, 4): 4\n- (5, 6): 3\n- (2, 4): 6\n- (3, 6): 8\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 5 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 8 = 26."
