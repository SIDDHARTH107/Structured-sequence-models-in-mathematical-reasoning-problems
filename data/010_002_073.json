Show that any neighborhood of x contains all but finitely many terms of the sequence. \n\nNow consider the sequence {1/n} in the standard topology on the real numbers. Determine whether this sequence is convergent or divergent, and if it is convergent, find its limit.",
    "message_2": "Proof: Let X be a topological space and let {xn} be a sequence in X that converges to x. Let N be any neighborhood of x. Since xn converges to x, for every open set U containing x, there exists a positive integer N_U such that for all n ≥ N_U, xn ∈ U. \n\nNow, consider the neighborhood N of x. There must exist a positive integer N_N such that for all n ≥ N_N, xn ∈ N. This means that all but finitely many terms of the sequence {xn} are contained in the neighborhood N, as required. This holds for any neighborhood of x, and thus the proof is complete.\n\nNow, consider the sequence {1/n} in the standard topology on the real numbers. We claim that this sequence converges to 0. To show this, let ε > 0 be given. We need to find a positive integer N such that for all n ≥ N, |1/n - 0| < ε, or equivalently, 1/n < ε.\n\nSince 1/n is a decreasing sequence and converges to 0 as n goes to infinity, there exists a positive integer N such that 1/N < ε. Then, for all n ≥ N, we have 1/n ≤ 1/N < ε. Thus, the sequence {1/n} converges to 0 in the standard topology on the real numbers."
