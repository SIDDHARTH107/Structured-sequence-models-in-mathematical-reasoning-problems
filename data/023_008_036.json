    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 over the interval [-2, 2], we will use the Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, L = (2 - (-2))/2 = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the a_0 coefficient:\n\na_0 = (1/(2L)) * ∫[-2,2] f(x) dx\n\na_0 = (1/4) * ∫[-2,2] (x^2 - 2x + 1) dx\n\nTo find the integral, we can use the power rule:\n\n∫(x^2 - 2x + 1) dx = (1/3)x^3 - x^2 + x\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral over the interval [-2, 2]:\n\na_0 = (1/4) * [(1/3)(2)^3 - (2)^2 + 2 - ((1/3)(-2)^3 - (-2)^2 + (-2))]\n\na_0 = (1/4) * [(8/3 - 4 + 2) - (-8/3 - 4 - 2)]\n\na_0 = (1/4) * (2/3 + 10/3)\n\na_0 = (1/4) * (12/3) = 1\n\nNow, let's find the a_n coefficients:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-2,2] f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[-2,2] (x^2 - 2x + 1) * cos(nπx/2) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an even function and cos(nπx/2) is also an even function, the integral of their product will be zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-2,2] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[-2,2] (x^2 - 2x + 1) * sin(nπx/2) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an even function and sin(nπx/2) is an odd function, the integral of their product will also be zero. Therefore, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 over the interval [-2, 2] is:\n\nf(x) = 1\n\nThis means that the function f(x) can be represented as a constant function with a value of 1 over the given interval."
