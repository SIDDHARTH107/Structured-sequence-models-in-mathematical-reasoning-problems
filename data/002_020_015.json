    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of the sector, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (angle/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere angle is the angle of the sector, r is the radius, and π is the constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60/360) * 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/6) * 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/6) * 16π\nArc length = 16π/6\nArc length = 8π/3 cm\n\nNow, we add the two radii (each 8 cm) to the arc length:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = (8π/3) + 2(8)\nPerimeter = (8π/3) + 16\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately (8π/3) + 16 cm."
