    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A×B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nLet's find A×B and B×A:\n\nA×B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA×B = {(2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB×A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB×A = {(4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare A×B and B×A:\n\nA×B = {(2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB×A = {(4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A×B and B×A are different. For example, (2, 4) is in A×B but not in B×A, and (4, 2) is in B×A but not in A×B. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative, as A×B ≠ B×A."
