    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. We can do this by calculating the shortest path between all pairs of vertices and then finding the maximum value among these shortest paths.\n\nWe can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices:\n\n1. Initialize a matrix D with the same dimensions as the adjacency matrix, and copy the adjacency matrix values into D. Set the diagonal elements to 0.\n2. For each vertex k, update the matrix D by considering all pairs of vertices i and j, and setting D[i][j] = min(D[i][j], D[i][k] + D[k][j]).\n\nAfter applying the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, we get the following matrix D:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3\n1 0 2 2 1 1 2 2 2\n1 2 0 1 3 1 2 3 3\n1 2 1 0 3 1 1 3 2\n2 1 3 3 0 2 1 1 2\n2 1 1 1 2 0 2 1 1\n2 2 2 1 1 2 0 2 1\n3 2 3 3 1 1 2 0 1\n3 2 3 2 2 1 1 1 0\n```\n\nNow, we find the maximum value in the matrix D, which is 3. Therefore, the diameter of G is 3."
