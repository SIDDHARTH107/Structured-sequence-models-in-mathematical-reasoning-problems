    "message_2": "To estimate the temperature at 4:30 PM using the Lagrange interpolation method, we first need to set up the interpolation polynomial. Let T(x) be the temperature at time x, where x is the number of hours since 9 AM. Then, we have the following data points:\n\nx0 = 0, T(x0) = 32°C (9 AM)\nx1 = 3, T(x1) = 36°C (12 PM)\nx2 = 6, T(x2) = 40°C (3 PM)\nx3 = 9, T(x3) = 34°C (6 PM)\n\nThe Lagrange interpolation polynomial is given by:\n\nT(x) = L(x) = T(x0) * L0(x) + T(x1) * L1(x) + T(x2) * L2(x) + T(x3) * L3(x)\n\nwhere\n\nL0(x) = [(x - x1)(x - x2)(x - x3)] / [(x0 - x1)(x0 - x2)(x0 - x3)]\nL1(x) = [(x - x0)(x - x2)(x - x3)] / [(x1 - x0)(x1 - x2)(x1 - x3)]\nL2(x) = [(x - x0)(x - x1)(x - x3)] / [(x2 - x0)(x2 - x1)(x2 - x3)]\nL3(x) = [(x - x0)(x - x1)(x - x2)] / [(x3 - x0)(x3 - x1)(x3 - x2)]\n\nNow, we want to find the temperature at 4:30 PM, which is 7.5 hours since 9 AM. So, we need to find T(7.5):\n\nL0(7.5) = [(7.5 - 3)(7.5 - 6)(7.5 - 9)] / [(0 - 3)(0 - 6)(0 - 9)] = (4.5)(1.5)(-1.5) / (-3)(-6)(-9) = 0.075\nL1(7.5) = [(7.5 - 0)(7.5 - 6)(7.5 - 9)] / [(3 - 0)(3 - 6)(3 - 9)] = (7.5)(1.5)(-1.5) / (3)(-3)(-6) = 0.375\nL2(7.5) = [(7.5 - 0)(7.5 - 3)(7.5 - 9)] / [(6 - 0)(6 - 3)(6 - 9)] = (7.5)(4.5)(-2.5) / (6)(3)(-3) = 0.625\nL3(7.5) = [(7.5 - 0)(7.5 - 3)(7.5 - 6)] / [(9 - 0)(9 - 3)(9 - 6)] = (7.5)(4.5)(1.5) / (9)(6)(3) = 0.25\n\nNow, we can find T(7.5):\n\nT(7.5) = 32 * 0.075 + 36 * 0.375 + 40 * 0.625 + 34 * 0.25 = 2.4 + 13.5 + 25 + 8.5 = 49.4°C\n\nSo, the estimated temperature at 4:30 PM is 49.4°C using the Lagrange interpolation method."
