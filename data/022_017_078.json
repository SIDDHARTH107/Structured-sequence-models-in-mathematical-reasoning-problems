The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr^2 = -4\nr = Â±2i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution to the differential equation is of the form:\n\ny(x) = e^(0x) (A * cos(2x) + B * sin(2x)) = A * cos(2x) + B * sin(2x)\n\nNow we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions.\n\n1) y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0)\n2 = A * 1 + B * 0\nA = 2\n\n2) y'(0) = 3:\n\nThe first derivative of y(x) is:\n\ny'(x) = -2A * sin(2x) + 2B * cos(2x)\n\nNow we use the initial condition y'(0) = 3:\n\n3 = -2A * sin(0) + 2B * cos(0)\n3 = -2 * 2 * 0 + 2B * 1\n3 = 2B\nB = 3/2\n\nSo the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = 2 * cos(2x) + (3/2) * sin(2x)"
