    "message_1": "A student is planning a road trip from New York to Los Angeles, which will have a total of 10 stops. The probability of their car breaking down is 0.05 at each stop. What is the probability that their car will break down exactly twice during the entire trip?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, car breaking down)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10 stops)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, 2 car breakdowns)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.05)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, 1 - p = 0.95)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(2) = (10C2) * (0.05^2) * (0.95^8)\n\nFirst, we calculate 10C2:\n\n10C2 = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!)\n     = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n     = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\n     = 45\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.05^2) = 0.0025\n(0.95^8) = 0.6634 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nNow, we plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(2) = 45 * 0.0025 * 0.6634\nP(2) â‰ˆ 0.0746\n\nSo, the probability that the car will break down exactly twice during the entire trip is approximately 0.0746 or 7.46%."
