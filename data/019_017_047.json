    "message_2": "There is only one model up to isomorphism that satisfies the theory T.\n\nTo see this, let's consider the structure of the models that satisfy T. In any such model, there must be at least one element a such that P(a) holds. Moreover, for any other element b ≠ a in the model, ¬P(b) must hold.\n\nNow, let's consider two models M1 and M2 that satisfy T. In both models, there is a unique element a1 in M1 and a2 in M2 such that P(a1) and P(a2), respectively. All other elements in M1 and M2 must satisfy ¬P.\n\nWe can define an isomorphism f: M1 → M2 by mapping a1 to a2 and all other elements in M1 to their corresponding elements in M2. Since f preserves the truth of the predicate P (i.e., P(a1) in M1 if and only if P(f(a1)) in M2), it is an isomorphism between M1 and M2.\n\nThus, there is only one model up to isomorphism that satisfies the theory T."
