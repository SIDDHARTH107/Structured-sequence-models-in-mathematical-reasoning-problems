    "message_2": "To simplify the rational expression (6x^2 + 15x) / (9x^2 + 6x), we can first factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\nGCF of 6x^2 and 15x is 3x.\nSo, 6x^2 + 15x = 3x(2x + 5)\n\nDenominator:\nGCF of 9x^2 and 6x is 3x.\nSo, 9x^2 + 6x = 3x(3x + 2)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n(3x(2x + 5)) / (3x(3x + 2))\n\nWe can now cancel out the common factor 3x from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(2x + 5) / (3x + 2)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is (2x + 5) / (3x + 2)."
