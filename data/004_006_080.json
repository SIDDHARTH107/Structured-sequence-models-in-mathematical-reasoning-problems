    "message_2": "To find the critical points, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 18x^2.\n\nUsing the power rule, the derivative f'(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 48x^2 + 36x\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x where f'(x) = 0 or f'(x) does not exist. Since f'(x) is a polynomial, it exists for all x. So, we only need to find the values of x where f'(x) = 0.\n\nTo do this, we can factor out the greatest common factor, which is 12x:\n\nf'(x) = 12x(x^2 - 4x + 3)\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0. We can factor this quadratic equation as (x - 1)(x - 3):\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the critical points occur when x = 0, x = 1, or x = 3."
