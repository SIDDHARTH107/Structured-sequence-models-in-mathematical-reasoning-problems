    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of getting exactly two 3's in 10 rolls of a fair six-sided die using Monte Carlo simulation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the number of simulations you want to run (the more simulations, the more accurate the estimate).\n2. For each simulation, roll the die 10 times and count the number of 3's.\n3. If the number of 3's is exactly 2, increment a counter.\n4. After all simulations are done, divide the counter by the total number of simulations to get the estimated probability.\n\nHere's a Python program to do this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_die():\n    return random.randint(1, 6)\n\ndef simulate_rolls(num_simulations):\n    count_two_threes = 0\n\n    for _ in range(num_simulations):\n        rolls = [roll_die() for _ in range(10)]\n        num_threes = rolls.count(3)\n\n        if num_threes == 2:\n            count_two_threes += 1\n\n    return count_two_threes / num_simulations\n\nnum_simulations = 100000\nestimated_probability = simulate_rolls(num_simulations)\nprint(f\"Estimated probability of getting exactly two 3's in 10 rolls: {estimated_probability:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThis program will output the estimated probability of getting exactly two 3's in 10 rolls of a fair six-sided die. You can adjust the `num_simulations` variable to increase or decrease the number of simulations, which will affect the accuracy of the estimate."
