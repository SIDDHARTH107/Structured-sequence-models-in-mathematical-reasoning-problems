    "message_1": "A tree that is 30 feet tall casts a shadow that is 50 feet long. If there is a person standing next to the tree, and their shadow is 10 feet long, how tall is the person? (Hint: Use the trigonometric ratio tangent)",
    "message_2": "We can use the concept of similar triangles to solve this problem. Since the tree and the person are both casting shadows under the same angle of elevation of the sun, their heights and shadow lengths are proportional.\n\nLet the height of the person be h. We can set up a proportion using the tree's height and shadow length and the person's height and shadow length:\n\n(height of tree) / (shadow length of tree) = (height of person) / (shadow length of person)\n\n30 / 50 = h / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\n30 * 10 = 50 * h\n300 = 50h\nh = 300 / 50\nh = 6\n\nSo, the person is 6 feet tall."
