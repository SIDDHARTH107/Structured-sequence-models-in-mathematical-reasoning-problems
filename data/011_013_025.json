    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, such that the order of the items does not matter.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose a team of 4 representatives from a group of 10 students without any restrictions. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, k is the number of students to be chosen, and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 4. So, the total number of ways to choose a team of 4 representatives without any restrictions is:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!) = 10! / (4!6!) = 210\n\nNow, let's consider the restriction that the 3 students cannot work together. We will subtract the number of ways these 3 students can be part of the team from the total number of ways calculated above.\n\nThere are 3 cases to consider:\n\n1. All 3 students are in the team: In this case, there is only 1 way to choose the team, as all 3 students are included, and we need to choose 1 more student from the remaining 7 students. This can be done in C(7, 1) = 7 ways.\n\n2. Two of the 3 students are in the team: In this case, we need to choose 2 students from the 3, and 2 more students from the remaining 7 students. This can be done in C(3, 2) * C(7, 2) = 3 * 21 = 63 ways.\n\n3. One of the 3 students is in the team: In this case, we need to choose 1 student from the 3, and 3 more students from the remaining 7 students. This can be done in C(3, 1) * C(7, 3) = 3 * 35 = 105 ways.\n\nNow, we will subtract the number of ways these 3 students can be part of the team from the total number of ways:\n\n210 - (7 + 63 + 105) = 210 - 175 = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 ways for a student to choose a team of 4 representatives from a group of 10 students, considering the restriction that the 3 students cannot work together."
