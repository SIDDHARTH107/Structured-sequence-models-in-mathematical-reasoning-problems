    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x² + 2x - 7, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x²)/dx + d(2x)/dx - d(7)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 2x^(2-1) + 2 * 1x^(1-1) - 0\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 5:\n\nf'(5) = 6(5) + 2\nf'(5) = 30 + 2\nf'(5) = 32\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x² + 2x - 7 at x = 5 is 32."
