    "message_1": "The manufacture of a certain type of bicycle requires three different metals: aluminum, steel, and titanium. The company has a limited budget and wishes to minimize the cost of producing bicycles while ensuring that each bicycle is made with the exact amount of metals required. They need to produce 100 bicycles, and each bicycle requires 3 kg of aluminum, 2 kg of steel, and 1 kg of titanium. The current market prices for aluminum, steel, and titanium are $2/kg, $3/kg, and $5/kg, respectively. Using the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, determine the optimal amount of each metal to use and the total cost of producing 100 bicycles.",
    "message_2": "In this problem, the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm is not necessary, as the amount of each metal required for each bicycle is fixed. Therefore, we can simply calculate the total amount of each metal needed and the total cost.\n\nFor 100 bicycles, the required amount of each metal is as follows:\n\nAluminum: 3 kg/bicycle * 100 bicycles = 300 kg\nSteel: 2 kg/bicycle * 100 bicycles = 200 kg\nTitanium: 1 kg/bicycle * 100 bicycles = 100 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of producing 100 bicycles using the given market prices:\n\nAluminum cost: 300 kg * $2/kg = $600\nSteel cost: 200 kg * $3/kg = $600\nTitanium cost: 100 kg * $5/kg = $500\n\nTotal cost = Aluminum cost + Steel cost + Titanium cost\nTotal cost = $600 + $600 + $500 = $1700\n\nSo, the optimal amount of each metal to use is 300 kg of aluminum, 200 kg of steel, and 100 kg of titanium, and the total cost of producing 100 bicycles is $1700."
