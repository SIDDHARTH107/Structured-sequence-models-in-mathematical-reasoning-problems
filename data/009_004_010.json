    "message_1": "A mass-spring system has a mass of 2 kg and a spring with a spring constant of 100 N/m. If the mass starts at rest from a displacement of 0.1 m, what is the amplitude of the resulting oscillations and how long does it take for the mass to complete one full cycle?",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the resulting oscillations, we can use the formula for the potential energy stored in a spring:\n\nPE = (1/2) * k * x^2\n\nwhere PE is the potential energy, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. Since the mass starts at rest from a displacement of 0.1 m, the amplitude of the oscillations will be equal to the initial displacement, which is 0.1 m.\n\nNow, to find the time it takes for the mass to complete one full cycle, we can use the formula for the period of oscillation in a mass-spring system:\n\nT = 2 * pi * sqrt(m/k)\n\nwhere T is the period of oscillation, m is the mass, and k is the spring constant. Plugging in the given values:\n\nT = 2 * pi * sqrt(2 kg / 100 N/m)\nT ≈ 2 * pi * sqrt(0.02)\nT ≈ 2 * pi * 0.1414\nT ≈ 0.888 s\n\nSo, the amplitude of the resulting oscillations is 0.1 m, and it takes approximately 0.888 seconds for the mass to complete one full cycle."
