    "message_2": "To find the production level that maximizes profit, we first need to find the profit function. Profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost. The revenue function is R(x) = px, where p is the price per unit and x is the number of units.\n\nGiven the price function p = 250 - 2x, the revenue function is R(x) = (250 - 2x)x = 250x - 2x^2.\n\nNow, we can find the profit function P(x) by subtracting the cost function C(x) from the revenue function R(x):\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (250x - 2x^2) - (2x^2 + 100x + 5000) = 250x - 2x^2 - 2x^2 - 100x - 5000 = -4x^2 + 150x - 5000.\n\nTo find the production level that maximizes profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the derivative of P(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = -8x + 150.\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n-8x + 150 = 0\n8x = 150\nx = 150/8\nx = 18.75\n\nSince the production level must be a whole number, we need to check the profit for both x = 18 and x = 19:\n\nP(18) = -4(18)^2 + 150(18) - 5000 = 620\nP(19) = -4(19)^2 + 150(19) - 5000 = 606\n\nThe profit is higher when the production level is 18 units. Therefore, the production level that maximizes profit is 18 units."
