    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(g(x)) at x = 2, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composition of functions, say h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative of h(x) with respect to x is given by:\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf(x) = (x^3 - 4x)^4\nf'(x) = 4(x^3 - 4x)^3 * (3x^2 - 4) (using the chain rule)\n\ng(x) = x^3 + 4x\ng'(x) = 3x^2 + 4\n\nNow, we will find f'(g(x)) and g'(x) at x = 2.\n\ng(2) = (2)^3 + 4(2) = 8 + 8 = 16\n\ng'(2) = 3(2)^2 + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16\n\nNow, we need to find f'(g(x)) at x = 2, which is f'(16).\n\nf'(16) = 4(16^3 - 4(16))^3 * (3(16)^2 - 4)\nf'(16) = 4(4096 - 64)^3 * (768 - 4)\nf'(16) = 4(4032)^3 * (764)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of f(g(x)) at x = 2 using the chain rule:\n\nh'(2) = f'(g(2)) * g'(2)\nh'(2) = f'(16) * 16\nh'(2) = 4(4032)^3 * (764) * 16\n\nh'(2) = 12582912 * 4032^3\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(g(x)) at x = 2 is 12582912 * 4032^3."
