    "message_2": "We want to find the smallest positive integer x such that 3^x ≡ 5 (mod 7). We can start by testing powers of 3 modulo 7:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n3^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3^5 ≡ 243 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nWe found that 3^5 ≡ 5 (mod 7). Therefore, the smallest positive integer x is 5."
