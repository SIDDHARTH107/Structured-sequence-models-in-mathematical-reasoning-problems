Given two orthonormal vectors v and w at the point (1,1,2), with v tangent to the curve of intersection of S with the plane z = 2, and w tangent to a meridian of S passing through the point (1,1,2), calculate the sectional curvature K(v,w) at the point (1,1,2).",
    "message_2": "To compute the sectional curvature K(v,w) at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the tangent vectors v and w, and then compute the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1,2) using the formula:\n\nK(v,w) = (R(v,w)w,v) / (|v|^2 * |w|^2 - (v,w)^2)\n\nwhere R(v,w) is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\n1. Find the tangent vectors v and w:\n\nThe surface S is given by the equation z = x^2 + y^2. The gradient of S at the point (1,1,2) is:\n\n∇S(1,1,2) = (2x, 2y, -1) = (2, 2, -1)\n\nThe plane z = 2 has the normal vector n = (0, 0, 1).\n\nNow, we find the tangent vector v to the curve of intersection of S with the plane z = 2. This vector is orthogonal to both the gradient of S and the normal vector of the plane:\n\nv = ∇S × n = (2, 2, -1) × (0, 0, 1) = (2, -2, 0)\n\nTo find the tangent vector w to a meridian of S passing through the point (1,1,2), we can take the cross product of the gradient of S and the tangent vector v:\n\nw = ∇S × v = (2, 2, -1) × (2, -2, 0) = (2, 2, 8)\n\nNow, we need to normalize the vectors v and w:\n\n|v| = sqrt(2^2 + (-2)^2 + 0^2) = 2 * sqrt(2)\n|w| = sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + 8^2) = 2 * sqrt(21)\n\nv_normalized = (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2), 0)\nw_normalized = (1/sqrt(21), 1/sqrt(21), 4/sqrt(21))\n\n2. Compute the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1,2):\n\nThe first and second fundamental forms of the surface S are given by:\n\nI = (E, F; F, G) = ((1 + 4x^2), 4xy; 4xy, (1 + 4y^2))\nII = (L, M; M, N) = (2x, 2y; 2y, 2x)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nI = (5, 4; 4, 5)\nII = (2, 2; 2, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (EG - F^2) / (EL - M^2) = (5*2 - 4^2) / (2*2 - 2^2) = (10 - 16) / (4 - 4) = -6 / 0\n\nSince the denominator is zero, the Gaussian curvature K is undefined at the point (1,1,2). Therefore, the sectional curvature K(v,w) is also undefined at this point."
