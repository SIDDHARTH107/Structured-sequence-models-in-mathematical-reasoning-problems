    "message_1": "Sure, here is a specific problem in Cheap Talk for a math student:\n\nSuppose two players, Alice and Bob, are playing the simultaneous move game. Alice can either choose to play Up or Down and Bob can either choose Left or Right. Before they play their moves, Alice can send a message to Bob. The cost of sending the message is c > 0 for Alice. If Alice sends a message, Bob receives it with probability p and correctly interprets it with probability q. If Bob receives the message, he will follow it exactly. If Bob doesn't receive the message, or receives it but interprets it incorrectly, he will play randomly (i.e. with probability 1/2 each). Both players aim to maximize their payoff.\n\nSuppose Alice's payoff is given by the following matrix:\n```\n            Left        Right\nUp          4,4          1,2\nDown        2,1          3,3\n```\n\nAnd Bob's payoff matrix is given by:\n```\n            Left        Right\nUp          3,3          1,2\nDown        2,2          4,4\n```\n\nDetermine the conditions under which Alice will be able to communicate truthfully and achieve her best payoff.",
    "message_2": "To determine the conditions under which Alice will be able to communicate truthfully and achieve her best payoff, we need to analyze the expected payoffs for Alice in different scenarios.\n\n1. If Alice sends a message and Bob receives and interprets it correctly (probability pq), they will both play their best response to each other's actions. In this case, Alice will choose Up and Bob will choose Left, resulting in a payoff of 4 for Alice.\n\n2. If Alice sends a message and Bob either doesn't receive it or interprets it incorrectly (probability 1-pq), Bob will play randomly. In this case, Alice's expected payoff will be the average of the payoffs when Bob plays Left and Right. If Alice chooses Up, her expected payoff is (4+1)/2 = 2.5. If Alice chooses Down, her expected payoff is (2+3)/2 = 2.5.\n\nNow, we need to compare the expected payoffs for Alice when she sends a message and when she doesn't. If Alice sends a message, her expected payoff is:\n\nE[Payoff | Message] = pq * 4 + (1 - pq) * 2.5 - c\n\nIf Alice doesn't send a message, her expected payoff is:\n\nE[Payoff | No Message] = 2.5\n\nFor Alice to prefer sending a message, the expected payoff when sending a message must be greater than the expected payoff when not sending a message:\n\nE[Payoff | Message] > E[Payoff | No Message]\n\npq * 4 + (1 - pq) * 2.5 - c > 2.5\n\nSolving for c, we get:\n\nc < pq * 1.5\n\nThus, Alice will be able to communicate truthfully and achieve her best payoff if the cost of sending the message, c, is less than 1.5 times the product of the probabilities p and q."
