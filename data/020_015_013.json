    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of fencing used to enclose the garden, we need to minimize the perimeter of the rectangle. Let the length of the garden be L and the width be W. The area of the garden is given by:\n\nA = L * W = 150 square feet\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is given by:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nWe want to minimize P. To do this, we can use calculus. First, we need to express one of the variables in terms of the other using the area equation. Let's express W in terms of L:\n\nW = 150 / L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the perimeter equation:\n\nP(L) = 2L + 2(150 / L)\n\nNow, we will find the critical points by taking the derivative of P with respect to L and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndP/dL = 2 - (300 / L^2) = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n300 / L^2 = 2\nL^2 = 300 / 2\nL^2 = 150\nL = √150 ≈ 12.25 feet\n\nNow, we can find W using the expression we found earlier:\n\nW = 150 / L\nW = 150 / 12.25 ≈ 12.25 feet\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that will minimize the amount of fencing used to enclose it are approximately 12.25 feet by 12.25 feet, which is a square."
