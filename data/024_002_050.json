    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve connecting the points P(1, 0, 1) and Q(2, 1, 5) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we need to parameterize the curve on the surface. Let's use the parameter t, where t ∈ [0, 1], and let the curve be given by (x(t), y(t), z(t)).\n\nSince the curve lies on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we have z(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2. Now, we need to find the length of the curve. The length of a curve in 3D space is given by the integral of the speed:\n\nL = ∫√(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 dt\n\nSince z(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2, we have dz/dt = 2x(t)(dx/dt) + 2y(t)(dy/dt). Now, we can rewrite the length as:\n\nL = ∫√((dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(t)(dx/dt) + 2y(t)(dy/dt))^2) dt\n\nTo find the geodesic curve, we want to minimize the length L. We can do this by using the Euler-Lagrange equations. Let F = √((dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(t)(dx/dt) + 2y(t)(dy/dt))^2). Then, the Euler-Lagrange equations are given by:\n\nd/dt (∂F/∂(dx/dt)) - ∂F/∂x = 0\nd/dt (∂F/∂(dy/dt)) - ∂F/∂y = 0\n\nSolving these equations is quite involved and typically requires numerical methods. However, we can make some observations that simplify the problem. Notice that the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is rotationally symmetric about the z-axis. Therefore, the geodesic curve must also be symmetric with respect to the z-axis. This means that the geodesic curve must lie in a plane that contains the z-axis.\n\nLet's assume that the geodesic curve lies in the plane x = ky, where k is a constant. Then, we have:\n\nz(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = (ky(t))^2 + y(t)^2 = k^2y(t)^2 + y(t)^2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the length L in terms of y(t) only:\n\nL = ∫√((k(dy/dt))^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2k^2y(t)(dy/dt) + 2y(t)(dy/dt))^2) dt\n\nTo find the geodesic curve, we need to minimize L. This can be done by solving the Euler-Lagrange equation for y(t):\n\nd/dt (∂F/∂(dy/dt)) - ∂F/∂y = 0\n\nAgain, solving this equation is quite involved and typically requires numerical methods. However, once the geodesic curve is found, we can determine its length by evaluating the integral L.\n\nIn summary, finding the geodesic curve connecting the points P(1, 0, 1) and Q(2, 1, 5) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 involves solving the Euler-Lagrange equations for the curve (x(t), y(t), z(t)). The problem can be simplified by noting that the geodesic curve must lie in a plane containing the z-axis, but solving the resulting equations still requires numerical methods. Once the geodesic curve is found, its length can be determined by evaluating the integral L."
