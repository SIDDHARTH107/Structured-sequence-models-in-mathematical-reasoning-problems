    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process of 500 units of a certain product, it is known that 5% of the products have a defect of a certain type. What is the probability that at least 20 units have the defect of that type?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the total number of units, k is the number of defective units, p is the probability of a unit being defective, and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective units from n total units.\n\nIn this case, n = 500, p = 0.05, and we want to find the probability that at least 20 units have the defect, which means we need to find the probability for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 500.\n\nTo find the probability of at least 20 units having the defect, we can find the probability of fewer than 20 units having the defect and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 19 and sum them up:\n\nSum = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)\n\nAfter calculating the sum, subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least 20 units having the defect:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - Sum\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the binomial probabilities and sum them up, we get:\n\nSum ≈ 0.3584859224\n\nSo, the probability of at least 20 units having the defect is:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - 0.3584859224 ≈ 0.6415140776\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least 20 units have the defect of that type is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
