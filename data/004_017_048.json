    "message_1": "Suppose you have a curve y = x^3/3 between the points x = 1 and x = 4. Calculate the arc length of the curve between these two points.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the arc length of the curve y = x^3/3 between the points x = 1 and x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^3/3\ndy/dx = d(x^3/3)/dx = (3x^2)/3 = x^2\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + (x^2)^2) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = x^2, then du = 2x dx. We also need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nu(1) = (1)^2 = 1\nu(4) = (4)^2 = 16\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nL = 1/2 ∫[1, 16] √(1 + u^2) du\n\nThis integral doesn't have a simple elementary antiderivative, but we can use numerical methods to approximate the value. Using a numerical integration method (such as Simpson's rule or a numerical software), we find:\n\nL ≈ 9.151\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^3/3 between the points x = 1 and x = 4 is approximately 9.151 units."
