The sales data for the past five years is given as follows: \n\nYear 1: 100 units\nYear 2: 120 units\nYear 3: 130 units\nYear 4: 125 units\nYear 5: 140 units\n\nUsing the least squares method, find a trend equation for the sales data and use it to forecast the sales for the next five years.",
    "message_2": "To find the trend equation using the least squares method, we first need to find the values of the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) for the linear regression line. The general equation for a linear regression line is:\n\ny = a + bx\n\nwhere y is the dependent variable (sales), x is the independent variable (years), a is the y-intercept, and b is the slope.\n\nTo find the slope (b), we use the following formula:\n\nb = (n * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy) / (n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)\n\nTo find the y-intercept (a), we use the following formula:\n\na = (Σy - b * Σx) / n\n\nLet's calculate the values for our sales data:\n\nΣx = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\nΣy = 100 + 120 + 130 + 125 + 140 = 615\nΣ(xy) = (1 * 100) + (2 * 120) + (3 * 130) + (4 * 125) + (5 * 140) = 100 + 240 + 390 + 500 + 700 = 1930\nΣ(x^2) = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55\nn = 5 (number of years)\n\nNow, let's calculate the slope (b):\n\nb = (5 * 1930 - 15 * 615) / (5 * 55 - 15^2) = (9650 - 9225) / (275 - 225) = 425 / 50 = 8.5\n\nNext, let's calculate the y-intercept (a):\n\na = (615 - 8.5 * 15) / 5 = (615 - 127.5) / 5 = 487.5 / 5 = 97.5\n\nSo, the trend equation is:\n\ny = 97.5 + 8.5x\n\nNow, we can use this equation to forecast the sales for the next five years:\n\nYear 6: y = 97.5 + 8.5 * 6 = 97.5 + 51 = 148.5 units\nYear 7: y = 97.5 + 8.5 * 7 = 97.5 + 59.5 = 157 units\nYear 8: y = 97.5 + 8.5 * 8 = 97.5 + 68 = 165.5 units\nYear 9: y = 97.5 + 8.5 * 9 = 97.5 + 76.5 = 174 units\nYear 10: y = 97.5 + 8.5 * 10 = 97.5 + 85 = 182.5 units\n\nThe forecasted sales for the next five years are approximately 148.5, 157, 165.5, 174, and 182.5 units."
