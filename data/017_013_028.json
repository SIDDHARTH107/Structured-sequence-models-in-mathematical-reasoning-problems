    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphism classes of groups with order 18, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. If a group G has order p^n, where p is prime and n is a positive integer, then G is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of order p^i, where i is a positive integer and the sum of all i's is n.\n\n2. If a group G has order pq, where p and q are distinct primes, then G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group Cpq or a non-abelian group of order pq.\n\n3. If a group G has order p^aq^b, where p and q are distinct primes and a, b are positive integers, then G is isomorphic to a direct product of a cyclic group of order p^a and a group of order q^b.\n\nNow, let's find all possible isomorphism classes of groups with order 18:\n\nSince 18 = 2 * 3^2, there are three possibilities for the structure of a group of order 18:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 18: C18\n2. A non-abelian group of order 18\n3. A direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6\n\nWe will now prove that each group is isomorphic to one of these three possibilities.\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 18: C18\n\nA group of order 18 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 18. By definition, a cyclic group of order 18 has an element of order 18, so C18 is isomorphic to itself.\n\n2. Non-abelian group of order 18\n\nLet G be a non-abelian group of order 18. By Sylow's Theorems, G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say N. Since N is of order 9, it is isomorphic to C9. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, P is of order 2 and isomorphic to C2. Since N is normal in G, we have G = N * P, and the internal direct product of N and P is a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6\n\nLet G be a group of order 18 that is not cyclic and not isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18. Then, G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say N, which is of order 9 and isomorphic to C9. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, P is of order 2 and isomorphic to C2. Since N is normal in G, we have G = N * P, and the internal direct product of N and P is a group of order 18. However, since G is not isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18, the internal direct product must be the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nTherefore, we have found all possible isomorphism classes of groups with order 18, and each group is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
