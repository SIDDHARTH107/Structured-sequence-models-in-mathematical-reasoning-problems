    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 7 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the length of its longest diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the longest diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h). In other words:\n\nd² = l² + w² + h²\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism (length = 7 cm, width = 4 cm, height = 5 cm), we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nd² = (7 cm)² + (4 cm)² + (5 cm)²\nd² = 49 cm² + 16 cm² + 25 cm²\nd² = 90 cm²\n\nNow, to find the length of the diagonal (d), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nd = √(90 cm²)\nd ≈ 9.49 cm\n\nSo, the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 9.49 cm."
