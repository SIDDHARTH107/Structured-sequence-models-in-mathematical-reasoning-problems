    "message_2": "To write the statement \"All dogs are mammals\" in predicate logic, we can use the following expression:\n\n∀x (D(x) → M(x))\n\nThis expression states that for all x, if x is a dog (D(x)), then x is a mammal (M(x)).\n\nNow, to determine whether the statement \"Spot is a dog\" is true or false, we need more information. If we know that Spot is a dog, we can represent this in predicate logic as:\n\nD(Spot)\n\nGiven the initial expression, we can infer that if Spot is a dog, then Spot is a mammal:\n\nD(Spot) → M(Spot)\n\nHowever, without any additional information, we cannot determine the truth value of the statement \"Spot is a dog\" (D(Spot))."
