The coffee shop chain has a daily demand of 560 cups, with a cost of $2 to produce each cup. The rivals offer coffee at a price of $4 or $5 per cup, respectively.\n\nIf the coffee shop chain acts as the leader in Stackelberg competition and sets its output and price first, while its rivals choose their outputs and prices afterward, find the optimal quantity and price strategy of the coffee shop chain that will maximize its daily profit.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal quantity and price strategy for the coffee shop chain, we need to consider the demand function and the cost function. Let's denote the quantity produced by the coffee shop chain as q1, the quantity produced by the first rival as q2, and the quantity produced by the second rival as q3. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2 + q3.\n\nAssuming a linear demand function, we can write the inverse demand function as P = a - bQ, where P is the price, a is the intercept, and b is the slope. We can find the values of a and b using the given prices and quantities for the rivals:\n\n1. When q2 = 0 and q3 = 0, the coffee shop chain sells all 560 cups, so P = $4: 4 = a - b(560)\n2. When q1 = 0, the first rival sells at $4 and the second rival sells at $5: 4 = a - b(q2), 5 = a - b(q3)\n\nNow we need to find the reaction functions for the rivals. Assuming they have the same cost structure as the coffee shop chain, their profit functions are:\n\nπ2 = (4 - 2)q2 - b(q1 + q3)q2\nπ3 = (5 - 2)q3 - b(q1 + q2)q3\n\nTo maximize their profits, the rivals will set their marginal profits equal to zero:\n\n∂π2/∂q2 = 2 - b(q1 + q3) = 0\n∂π3/∂q3 = 3 - b(q1 + q2) = 0\n\nSolving these equations for q2 and q3, we get the reaction functions:\n\nq2 = (2/b) - (q1 + q3)\nq3 = (3/b) - (q1 + q2)\n\nNow we can find the profit function for the coffee shop chain:\n\nπ1 = (P - 2)q1 = (a - bQ - 2)q1 = (a - b(q1 + q2 + q3) - 2)q1\n\nSubstituting the reaction functions into the profit function:\n\nπ1 = (a - b(q1 + (2/b) - (q1 + q3) + (3/b) - (q1 + q2)) - 2)q1\n\nSimplifying and taking the derivative with respect to q1:\n\n∂π1/∂q1 = a - 3bq1 - 2 = 0\n\nNow we can solve for q1:\n\n3bq1 = a - 2\nq1 = (a - 2) / 3b\n\nUsing the demand equation from earlier (4 = a - b(560)), we can solve for a and b:\n\na = 4 + 560b\nq1 = (4 + 560b - 2) / 3b = (2 + 560b) / 3b\n\nNow we can find the optimal quantity q1 by plugging the values of a and b back into the equation:\n\nq1 = (2 + 560(1/560)) / 3(1/560) = (2 + 1) / (3/560) = 3 * (560/3) = 560\n\nSo the optimal quantity for the coffee shop chain is 560 cups. To find the optimal price, we can use the inverse demand function:\n\nP = a - bQ = 4 - (1/560)(560) = 4 - 1 = $3\n\nThus, the optimal price strategy for the coffee shop chain is to sell each cup of coffee for $3."
