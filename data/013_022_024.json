    "message_1": "Suppose in a Dictator Game, the dictator is given 10 tokens to distribute between themselves and a recipient. If the recipient rejects the allocation, both players receive zero tokens. What is the optimal amount that the dictator should offer to the recipient to maximize their own payoff if the recipient's utility function is U(x) = sqrt(x), where x is the number of tokens received by the recipient?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the dictator's payoff, we need to find the point at which the recipient is indifferent between accepting and rejecting the offer. This means that the recipient's utility from accepting the offer should be greater than or equal to their utility from rejecting the offer, which is zero.\n\nLet x be the number of tokens offered to the recipient, and let y be the number of tokens kept by the dictator. Then, we have:\n\nx + y = 10\n\nThe recipient's utility function is U(x) = sqrt(x). We want to find the value of x that makes the recipient indifferent between accepting and rejecting the offer:\n\nU(x) >= 0\nsqrt(x) >= 0\n\nSince the square root function is always non-negative, this inequality holds for all non-negative values of x. However, we want to find the smallest value of x that satisfies this inequality, as this will maximize the dictator's payoff.\n\nTo do this, we can look at the first derivative of the recipient's utility function with respect to x:\n\nU'(x) = d(sqrt(x))/dx = 1/(2*sqrt(x))\n\nThe first derivative is positive for all x > 0, which means that the recipient's utility function is strictly increasing. Therefore, the smallest value of x that satisfies the inequality is x = 0.\n\nHowever, offering x = 0 tokens to the recipient would not be a rational decision for the dictator, as the recipient would reject the offer, leaving both players with zero tokens. Instead, the dictator should offer a small positive amount of tokens to the recipient, just enough to make them accept the offer.\n\nIn practice, the optimal amount to offer would depend on the specific preferences and beliefs of the recipient. However, from a purely mathematical standpoint, the dictator should offer an infinitesimally small positive amount of tokens to the recipient, keeping as close to 10 tokens for themselves as possible."
