    "message_1": "A surveyor needs to find the distance between two buildings. Building A is 50 meters high and building B is 30 meters high. The angle of elevation from the surveyor's position to the top of building A is 60 degrees, while the angle of elevation to the top of building B is 45 degrees. What is the distance between the two buildings? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance from the surveyor to building A as x and the distance from the surveyor to building B as y. We can use the tangent function to set up two equations:\n\ntan(60) = 50/x\ntan(45) = 30/y\n\nWe know that tan(60) = √3 and tan(45) = 1, so we can rewrite the equations as:\n\n√3 = 50/x\n1 = 30/y\n\nNow we can solve for x and y:\n\nx = 50/√3\ny = 30\n\nNow we need to find the distance between the two buildings. Let's denote this distance as d. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find d:\n\nd^2 = (x - y)^2 + (50 - 30)^2\n\nSubstitute the values of x and y:\n\nd^2 = (50/√3 - 30)^2 + (20)^2\n\nNow we can calculate the value of d:\n\nd ≈ 37.3\n\nSo, the distance between the two buildings is approximately 37 meters."
