    "message_1": "A population of rabbits is introduced to an island. The initial population is 1000 rabbits and the maximum carrying capacity of the island is 5000 rabbits. The growth rate of the population is proportional to the number of rabbits present and is modeled by the differential equation \n\ndN/dt = 0.02N(1 - (N/5000))\n\nwhere N is the number of rabbits and t is time in months. What will be the size of the rabbit population after 6 months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation. The equation is a logistic differential equation, which has the general form:\n\ndN/dt = rN(1 - (N/K))\n\nwhere r is the growth rate and K is the carrying capacity.\n\nIn our case, r = 0.02 and K = 5000. To solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We rewrite the equation as:\n\n(1/N(1 - (N/5000))) dN = 0.02 dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/N(1 - (N/5000))) dN = ∫0.02 dt\n\nTo solve the left side integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = 1 - (N/5000), then du = -dN/5000. So, -5000 du = dN. The integral becomes:\n\n∫(-5000/(5000 - 5000u)) du = ∫0.02 dt\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides:\n\n-5000 ln|5000 - 5000u| = 0.02t + C₁\n\nNow, we substitute back N in terms of u:\n\n-5000 ln|5000(1 - N/5000)| = 0.02t + C₁\n\nTo find the constant C₁, we use the initial condition N(0) = 1000:\n\n-5000 ln|5000(1 - 1000/5000)| = 0.02(0) + C₁\n\n-5000 ln|4000| = C₁\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\n-5000 ln|5000(1 - N/5000)| = 0.02t - 5000 ln|4000|\n\nTo find the size of the rabbit population after 6 months, we plug in t = 6:\n\n-5000 ln|5000(1 - N/5000)| = 0.02(6) - 5000 ln|4000|\n\nNow, we solve for N:\n\nln|5000(1 - N/5000)| = (0.12 - ln|4000|)/(-5)\n\n5000(1 - N/5000) = e^((0.12 - ln|4000|)/(-5))\n\n1 - N/5000 = e^((0.12 - ln|4000|)/(-5))/5000\n\nN/5000 = 1 - e^((0.12 - ln|4000|)/(-5))/5000\n\nN = 5000(1 - e^((0.12 - ln|4000|)/(-5))/5000)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nN ≈ 1838.63\n\nSo, after 6 months, the size of the rabbit population will be approximately 1839 rabbits."
