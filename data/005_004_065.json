They tested 8 cars of each model and recorded the distance traveled in miles with 10 gallons of fuel. The data is given below. \n\nModel 1: 240, 220, 260, 250, 270, 230, 240, 250\nModel 2: 280, 290, 300, 270, 260, 280, 295, 285\nModel 3: 310, 340, 320, 330, 350, 320, 340, 350\n\nIs there a significant difference in the fuel efficiency of the three models of cars at a 5% level of significance using ANOVA?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the fuel efficiency of the three models of cars at a 5% level of significance using ANOVA, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each group (model).\n2. Calculate the overall mean.\n3. Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and total sum of squares (SST).\n4. Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB) and mean square within groups (MSW).\n5. Calculate the F statistic and compare it to the critical F value.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Mean of each group:\nModel 1: (240+220+260+250+270+230+240+250)/8 = 246.25\nModel 2: (280+290+300+270+260+280+295+285)/8 = 281.25\nModel 3: (310+340+320+330+350+320+340+350)/8 = 332.5\n\n2. Overall mean:\n(246.25+281.25+332.5)/3 = 286.67\n\n3. Calculate SSB, SSW, and SST:\nSSB = Σn_i*(mean_i - overall_mean)^2\nSSB = 8*((246.25-286.67)^2 + (281.25-286.67)^2 + (332.5-286.67)^2) = 8*(1640.56 + 29.16 + 2102.56) = 21872.8\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - mean_i)^2\nSSW = (20^2 + 30^2 + 10^2 + 0^2 + 20^2 + 10^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) + (10^2 + 0^2 + 20^2 + 10^2 + 20^2 + 0^2 + 10^2 + 0^2) + (20^2 + 0^2 + 10^2 + 20^2 + 0^2 + 10^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = 3700\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 21872.8 + 3700 = 25572.8\n\n4. Calculate MSB and MSW:\nMSB = SSB/(k-1) = 21872.8/(3-1) = 10936.4\nMSW = SSW/(N-k) = 3700/(24-3) = 185\n\n5. Calculate the F statistic and compare it to the critical F value:\nF = MSB/MSW = 10936.4/185 = 59.11\n\nNow, we need to find the critical F value for a 5% level of significance. We use the F-distribution table with degrees of freedom (df1 = k-1 = 2, df2 = N-k = 21). The critical F value for a 5% level of significance is 3.47.\n\nSince the calculated F statistic (59.11) is greater than the critical F value (3.47), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the fuel efficiency of the three models of cars. Therefore, there is a significant difference in the fuel efficiency of the three models of cars at a 5% level of significance using ANOVA."
