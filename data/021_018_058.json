    "message_2": "The Tabu search optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization method that is used to find the global optimum of a function. It is particularly useful for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, it is not the most efficient method for solving continuous optimization problems like the one presented here. Instead, we can use calculus to find the maximum value of the function within the given interval.\n\nTo find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x within the interval [0, 5], we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the first derivative of the function, f'(x), to determine the critical points where the function may have a maximum or minimum value.\n2. Find the second derivative of the function, f''(x), to determine the concavity of the function at the critical points.\n3. Evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval to find the maximum value.\n\nStep 1: Find the first derivative, f'(x).\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nStep 2: Find the critical points by setting f'(x) = 0.\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either use the quadratic formula or try to factor the equation. In this case, the equation can be factored as follows:\n\n3(x^2 - 6x + 8) = 0\n3(x - 2)(x - 4) = 0\n\nThe critical points are x = 2 and x = 4.\n\nStep 3: Find the second derivative, f''(x).\nf''(x) = 6x - 18\n\nNow, we can determine the concavity of the function at the critical points:\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 18 = -6 (concave down, so x = 2 is a local maximum)\nf''(4) = 6(4) - 18 = 6 (concave up, so x = 4 is a local minimum)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval.\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 9(0)^2 + 24(0) = 0\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 24(2) = 8 - 36 + 48 = 20\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 24(4) = 64 - 144 + 96 = 16\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 9(5)^2 + 24(5) = 125 - 225 + 120 = 20\n\nThe maximum value of the function within the interval [0, 5] is 20, which occurs at x = 2 and x = 5."
