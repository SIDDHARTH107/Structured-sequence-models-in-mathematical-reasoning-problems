The cost of the cable between each pair of routers is as follows:\n\n- Router 1 and Router 2: $500 per meter\n- Router 1 and Router 3: $400 per meter\n- Router 2 and Router 3: $600 per meter\n- Router 2 and Router 4: $300 per meter\n- Router 3 and Router 5: $700 per meter\n- Router 4 and Router 5: $500 per meter\n\nSuppose you are given the task of connecting these 5 routers with cables at the minimum total cost. Determine the lengths of the cables that you should use between each pair of routers to minimize the total cost of the network.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. In this case, the graph is the network of routers, and the edge weights are the costs of the cables.\n\nHere are the steps to apply Kruskal's algorithm:\n\n1. Sort all the edges (cables) in increasing order of their weights (costs).\n2. Start with an empty graph (no cables connected).\n3. Add the next edge (cable) with the lowest weight (cost) to the graph, as long as it doesn't form a cycle.\n4. Repeat step 3 until all the routers are connected.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. Sorted edges (cables) by increasing costs:\n   - Router 2 and Router 4: $300 per meter\n   - Router 1 and Router 3: $400 per meter\n   - Router 1 and Router 2: $500 per meter\n   - Router 4 and Router 5: $500 per meter\n   - Router 2 and Router 3: $600 per meter\n   - Router 3 and Router 5: $700 per meter\n\n2. Start with an empty graph.\n\n3. Add the next edge (cable) with the lowest weight (cost) to the graph, as long as it doesn't form a cycle:\n   - Add Router 2 and Router 4: $300 per meter\n   - Add Router 1 and Router 3: $400 per meter\n   - Add Router 1 and Router 2: $500 per meter (adding Router 4 and Router 5 would form a cycle)\n   - Add Router 4 and Router 5: $500 per meter\n\nNow all the routers are connected, and we have the minimum spanning tree:\n\n- Router 1 and Router 2: $500 per meter\n- Router 1 and Router 3: $400 per meter\n- Router 2 and Router 4: $300 per meter\n- Router 4 and Router 5: $500 per meter\n\nThe total cost of the network is minimized with these cable connections. Note that the actual lengths of the cables are not given in the problem, so we cannot determine the exact total cost. However, we have found the optimal connections to minimize the total cost."
