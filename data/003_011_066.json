    "message_2": "To find the distance between the ship and the base of the lighthouse, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have the angle of depression (20 degrees) and the height of the lighthouse (50 meters).\n\nLet's denote the distance between the ship and the base of the lighthouse as x. We can set up the following equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(20°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(20°) = 50 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 50 / tan(20°)\nx ≈ 133.97\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the distance between the ship and the base of the lighthouse is approximately 134 meters."
