Prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nHint: Consider the possible structures of G, based on the number and order of its elements, and use the concept of isomorphism to show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to V4.",
    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the number and order of its elements.\n\nSince G is a group of order 4, it has 4 elements. Let's denote these elements as {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element. Now, we will consider the possible orders of the elements a, b, and c.\n\nCase 1: There exists an element of order 4.\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume that the order of element a is 4. That means a^4 = e, and a, a^2, a^3, and e are distinct elements in G. Therefore, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, and G is a cyclic group generated by a, i.e., G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements have order 2.\nIn this case, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. Now, we need to show that G is isomorphic to V4. We know that V4 = {e, x, y, z}, where x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = e, and xy = z, yz = x, zx = y. We can establish an isomorphism between G and V4 by mapping the elements as follows:\n\nφ: G → V4\nφ(e) = e\nφ(a) = x\nφ(b) = y\nφ(c) = z\n\nWe need to show that this mapping preserves the group operation. Since a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e, we have:\n\nφ(a * a) = φ(a^2) = φ(e) = e = x * x = φ(a) * φ(a)\nφ(b * b) = φ(b^2) = φ(e) = e = y * y = φ(b) * φ(b)\nφ(c * c) = φ(c^2) = φ(e) = e = z * z = φ(c) * φ(c)\n\nNow, let's consider the product of a and b. Since a and b have order 2, their product cannot be equal to a or b. Therefore, a * b = c, and we have:\n\nφ(a * b) = φ(c) = z = x * y = φ(a) * φ(b)\n\nSimilarly, we can show that φ(b * c) = φ(a) and φ(c * a) = φ(b). Therefore, the mapping φ preserves the group operation, and G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
