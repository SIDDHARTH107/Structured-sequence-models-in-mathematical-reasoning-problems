    "message_2": "In a two-dimensional topological field theory, the Hilbert space is spanned by states that are invariant under continuous deformations of the space. The dimension of the Hilbert space is given as 4, which means there are 4 linearly independent states.\n\nTo find the number of states with spin 1/2, we need to consider the possible representations of the spin. In a two-dimensional space, the spin can be represented by the SU(2) group, which has representations labeled by non-negative half-integers (0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ...). The dimension of the representation with spin j is given by (2j + 1).\n\nFor spin 0 (scalar), the dimension is (2*0 + 1) = 1.\nFor spin 1/2 (spinor), the dimension is (2*(1/2) + 1) = 2.\nFor spin 1 (vector), the dimension is (2*1 + 1) = 3.\n\nSince the total dimension of the Hilbert space is 4, we can have one scalar (spin 0) state and two spinor (spin 1/2) states, or we can have one vector (spin 1) state and one scalar (spin 0) state.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of states with spin 1/2. In the first case, there are two spin 1/2 states. In the second case, there are no spin 1/2 states. Since we cannot determine the exact number of spin 1/2 states without more information about the specific topological field theory, we can only conclude that the number of spin 1/2 states is either 0 or 2."
