    "message_1": "In a Stackelberg competition game, a company must decide on how much to produce of its product given that its competitor has already made their production decisions. \n\nAssume that the competitor has decided to produce 100 units of the product, the market demand function is given by Q = 500 - P, and the cost function of the first company is C(Q) = 5Q. \n\nWhat quantity should the first company produce to maximize its profits?",
    "message_2": "To maximize its profits, the first company should determine the optimal production quantity by considering the market demand function, the competitor's production, and its own cost function.\n\n1. Determine the inverse demand function:\n\nThe market demand function is given by Q = 500 - P. We can rewrite this as the inverse demand function, P(Q) = 500 - Q.\n\n2. Calculate the total quantity produced in the market:\n\nSince the competitor has already decided to produce 100 units, the total quantity produced in the market will be Q_total = Q_first_company + 100.\n\n3. Calculate the price based on the total quantity produced:\n\nP(Q_total) = 500 - Q_total = 500 - (Q_first_company + 100)\n\n4. Calculate the revenue for the first company:\n\nRevenue = Price * Quantity = (500 - (Q_first_company + 100)) * Q_first_company\n\n5. Calculate the cost for the first company:\n\nCost = C(Q_first_company) = 5 * Q_first_company\n\n6. Calculate the profit for the first company:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = (500 - (Q_first_company + 100)) * Q_first_company - 5 * Q_first_company\n\n7. Maximize the profit by taking the derivative with respect to Q_first_company and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dQ_first_company = (500 - (Q_first_company + 100)) - Q_first_company - 5 = 0\n\n8. Solve for Q_first_company:\n\n395 - 2 * Q_first_company = 0\nQ_first_company = 395 / 2 = 197.5\n\nSince the production quantity should be a whole number, the first company should produce either 197 or 198 units to maximize its profits."
