    "message_2": "First, let's find (A x B) x C and A x (B x C).\n\n(A x B) x C:\nTo find the Cartesian product (A x B), we form ordered pairs with elements from set A as the first element and elements from set B as the second element. So, A x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A x B) and C. We form ordered pairs with elements from set (A x B) as the first element and elements from set C as the second element. So, (A x B) x C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}.\n\nA x (B x C):\nTo find the Cartesian product (B x C), we form ordered pairs with elements from set B as the first element and elements from set C as the second element. So, B x C = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of A and (B x C). We form ordered pairs with elements from set A as the first element and elements from set (B x C) as the second element. So, A x (B x C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}.\n\nNow let's verify if (A x B) x C = A x (B x C).\n\n(A x B) x C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nWe can see that the two sets are equal if we consider the ordered pairs in (A x B) x C as equivalent to the ordered pairs in A x (B x C). For example, ((1, 3), 5) can be considered equivalent to (1, (3, 5)). Therefore, we can conclude that (A x B) x C = A x (B x C)."
