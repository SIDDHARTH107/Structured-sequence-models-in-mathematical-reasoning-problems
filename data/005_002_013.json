    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of all apples in the population, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.96)\nσ = standard deviation\nn = sample size\n\nGiven:\nx̄ = 120 grams\nσ = 10 grams\nn = 30\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nCI = 120 ± (1.96 * (10 / √30))\n\nCI = 120 ± (1.96 * (10 / 5.477))\n\nCI = 120 ± (1.96 * 1.825)\n\nCI = 120 ± 3.577\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of all apples in the population is (116.423, 123.577) grams."
