    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide 27 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. \n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let P be this 3-Sylow subgroup. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. By the classification of groups of order p^2 (where p is prime), P must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. In either case, P has an element of order 9. Let x be an element of order 9 in P.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since |G| = 27 and |P| = 9, we have |G/P| = 3. Thus, G/P is a cyclic group of order 3, generated by some coset gP, where g is an element of G. Since (gP)^3 = g^3P = P, we have that g^3 ∈ P. Since P has an element of order 9 (namely x), we can write g^3 = x^k for some integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ 8. \n\nNow, consider the element gx^(-k) in G. We have (gx^(-k))^3 = g^3x^(-3k) = x^(3k) = x^(9) = e, where e is the identity element in G. Thus, gx^(-k) has order 3. Let y = gx^(-k). Then, G is generated by x and y, with x having order 9 and y having order 3. Moreover, since x ∈ P and P is normal in G, we have xy = yx. Therefore, G is a cyclic group generated by xy, and G is isomorphic to Z_27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, then G cannot be cyclic. This is because a cyclic group of order 27 has a unique subgroup of order 9 (generated by an element of order 9), which would contradict the existence of three distinct 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic and isomorphic to Z_27, or G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
