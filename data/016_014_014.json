    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its construction can be described as follows:\n\n1. Start with a line segment of length 1.\n2. Divide the line segment into two equal parts.\n3. Rotate the right half by 90 degrees.\n4. Reconnect the two halves.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of segments in the curve doubles, and the length of each segment is reduced by a factor of √2. To find the total length of the Lévy C curve after the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal length = (Initial length) * (Number of segments) / (Length reduction factor)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nAfter the 5th iteration, the number of segments is 2^5 = 32, and the length reduction factor is √2. So the total length of the Lévy C curve after the 5th iteration is:\n\nTotal length = (1) * (32) / (√2)^5\nTotal length = 32 / (2^(5/2))\nTotal length = 32 / (2^2.5)\nTotal length = 32 / (2^2 * 2^0.5)\nTotal length = 32 / (4 * √2)\nTotal length = 8 / √2\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √2:\n\nTotal length = (8 * √2) / (2)\nTotal length = 4√2\n\nSo, the total length of the Lévy C curve after the 5th iteration is 4√2."
