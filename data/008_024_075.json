    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. Therefore, these two equations are not independent, and they represent the same line. Since they represent the same line, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for y in terms of x (or vice versa) using the first equation:\n\n2x - y = 3\ny = 2x - 3\n\nNow, for any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y that satisfies the system of equations. The general solution is given by:\n\nx = x\ny = 2x - 3"
