    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1 in the interval [0, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 and x = 3 are the critical points.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 4] and the critical points to find the maximum and minimum values of the function.\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 1 = 1\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 1 = -1\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 1 = 1\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 1 = 9\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find that the maximum value is 9 at x = 4, and the minimum value is -1 at x = 1."
