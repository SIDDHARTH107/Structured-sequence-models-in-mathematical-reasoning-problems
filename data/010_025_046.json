    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example numerical problem for a student studying Topological Quantum Field Theory: \n\nSuppose we have a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) with the partition function Z defined by $$Z(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{ki}q^{\\frac{d_i}{2}}$$ where X is a closed, oriented, 2-dimensional manifold, $k$ is the TQFT's Lagrangian, $d_i$ is the index of the i-th irreducible representation of a compact Lie group G, and $q$ is a complex variable. If we take G to be SU(2), find the partition function for the TQFT with $k=-\\frac{1}{4}$ and $n=4$. Evaluate the partition function at $q=1$ and $q=-1$.",
    "message_2": "For the compact Lie group SU(2), the irreducible representations are labeled by a non-negative half-integer j, and the dimension of the representation is given by $d_j = 2j + 1$. For the first four irreducible representations, we have:\n\n1. $j = 0$, $d_0 = 1$\n2. $j = \\frac{1}{2}$, $d_1 = 2$\n3. $j = 1$, $d_2 = 3$\n4. $j = \\frac{3}{2}$, $d_3 = 4$\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the partition function formula, along with the given values for $k$ and $n$:\n\n$$Z(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4}(-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}i}q^{\\frac{d_i}{2}}$$\n\nLet's evaluate the partition function at $q=1$:\n\n$$Z(1) = (-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}(1)}(1)^{\\frac{1}{2}} + (-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}(2)}(1)^{1} + (-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}(3)}(1)^{\\frac{3}{2}} + (-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}(4)}(1)^{2}$$\n\n$$Z(1) = i + 1 - i + 1 = 2$$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the partition function at $q=-1$:\n\n$$Z(-1) = (-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}(1)}(-1)^{\\frac{1}{2}} + (-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}(2)}(-1)^{1} + (-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}(3)}(-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}} + (-1)^{-\\frac{1}{4}(4)}(-1)^{2}$$\n\n$$Z(-1) = i(-i) + 1 - i(i) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n\nSo, the partition function for the TQFT with $k=-\\frac{1}{4}$ and $n=4$ is $Z(X) = 2$ for both $q=1$ and $q=-1$."
