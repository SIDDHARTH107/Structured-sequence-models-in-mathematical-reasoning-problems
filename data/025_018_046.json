    "message_2": "To find the degree of the map between the two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$, we first need to find a rational map between them. Let's consider the following map:\n\n$$\\phi: C_1 \\to C_2$$\n$$\\phi(x, y) = (x^3, y)$$\n\nWe can check that this map is well-defined by substituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n\n$$y^3 = x^4 + 1 \\implies y^3 = (x^3)^4 + 1$$\n\nSo, the image of a point $(x, y) \\in C_1$ under the map $\\phi$ is indeed a point in $C_2$.\n\nNow, let's find the degree of this map. The degree of a map between two curves is the number of preimages of a general point in the target curve. In other words, we need to find the number of points in $C_1$ that are mapped to a general point $(u, v) \\in C_2$.\n\nFrom the definition of the map $\\phi$, we have:\n\n$$x^3 = u$$\n$$y = v$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $C_1$, we get:\n\n$$v^3 = (u^{1/3})^4 + 1$$\n\nNow, we need to count the number of solutions $(x, y) \\in C_1$ that satisfy these equations. Since $v^3 = x^4 + 1$, we have a single value for $v$ for each value of $x$. Moreover, since $x^3 = u$, there are three possible values for $x$ for each value of $u$. Therefore, there are a total of $3$ preimages in $C_1$ for a general point $(u, v) \\in C_2$.\n\nHence, the degree of the map $\\phi: C_1 \\to C_2$ is $3$."
