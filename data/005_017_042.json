    "message_1": "A stock trader analyzed the daily closing prices of 5 technology stocks (IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon) for the last 30 trading days. Using principal component analysis, he calculated the first principal component of the daily returns and found that it captured 70% of the total variation of the returns. If the daily returns of the 5 stocks were standardized to have mean 0 and variance 1, what is the weight of IBM in the first principal component?",
    "message_2": "To find the weight of IBM in the first principal component, we need more information about the correlation or covariance matrix of the daily returns of the 5 stocks. Principal component analysis (PCA) is based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance or correlation matrix. The first principal component is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, and the weights of the stocks in the first principal component are the components of this eigenvector.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance or correlation matrix. Therefore, we cannot determine the weight of IBM in the first principal component with the given information."
