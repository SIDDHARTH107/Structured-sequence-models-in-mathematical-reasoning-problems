    "message_1": "A company adopts a Cournot model to decide how much output to produce. The inverse demand function for its product is given as P=150-3Q. The company's cost function is C(Q)=10Q+20. There is only one other firm in the market with identical cost structure. Determine the optimal quantity of output that the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal quantity of output that the company should produce to maximize its profit, we need to first find the reaction functions for both firms. The Cournot model assumes that each firm chooses its output level, taking the output level of the other firm as given.\n\nLet Q1 be the output of the first firm and Q2 be the output of the second firm. Then, the total output in the market is Q = Q1 + Q2. The inverse demand function is given as P = 150 - 3Q.\n\nRevenue for the first firm is R1 = P * Q1 = (150 - 3(Q1 + Q2)) * Q1. The cost function for the first firm is C1(Q1) = 10Q1 + 20. Profit for the first firm is π1 = R1 - C1 = (150 - 3(Q1 + Q2)) * Q1 - (10Q1 + 20).\n\nTo find the optimal output for the first firm, we need to maximize its profit with respect to Q1. To do this, we take the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to Q1 and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(π1)/dQ1 = (150 - 3(Q1 + Q2)) - 3Q1 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for Q1, we get the reaction function for the first firm:\n\nQ1 = (140 - 3Q2)/6\n\nSince both firms have identical cost structures, the reaction function for the second firm will be:\n\nQ2 = (140 - 3Q1)/6\n\nNow, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the Nash equilibrium:\n\nQ1 = (140 - 3((140 - 3Q1)/6))/6\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n6Q1 = 140 - 3((140 - 3Q1)/6)\n\n6Q1 = 140 - (140 - 3Q1)/2\n\n12Q1 = 280 - 140 + 3Q1\n\n9Q1 = 140\n\nQ1 = 140/9 ≈ 15.56\n\nNow, we can find Q2 using the reaction function for the second firm:\n\nQ2 = (140 - 3Q1)/6\n\nQ2 = (140 - 3(140/9))/6\n\nQ2 = (140 - 140/3)/6\n\nQ2 = 140/9 ≈ 15.56\n\nSo, the optimal quantity of output that each company should produce to maximize its profit is approximately 15.56 units."
