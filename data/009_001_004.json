    "message_1": "A population of rabbits is introduced to a new area where they have no natural predators. The population is initially 100 rabbits, and it grows at a rate proportional to the population size, with a constant of proportionality of 0.2 rabbits per day per rabbit. Write a differential equation that models the population growth and find the population after 10 days.",
    "message_2": "To write a differential equation that models the population growth, we can use the following formula:\n\ndP/dt = k * P\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population, k is the constant of proportionality, and P is the population size.\n\nIn this case, k = 0.2 rabbits per day per rabbit. So the differential equation is:\n\ndP/dt = 0.2 * P\n\nTo find the population after 10 days, we need to solve this differential equation. This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its general solution is given by:\n\nP(t) = P(0) * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P(0) is the initial population, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this problem, P(0) = 100 rabbits, k = 0.2, and t = 10 days. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nP(10) = 100 * e^(0.2 * 10)\n\nP(10) = 100 * e^2\n\nP(10) ≈ 100 * 7.389\n\nP(10) ≈ 738.9\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a rabbit, we can round this value to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the population after 10 days will be approximately 739 rabbits."
