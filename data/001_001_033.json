    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:\n3x + 7 - 7 = 16 - 7\n3x = 9\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n3x / 3 = 9 / 3\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution is x = 3."
