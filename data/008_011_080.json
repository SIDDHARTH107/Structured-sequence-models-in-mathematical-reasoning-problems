    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we will find the values of x, y, and z by dividing the respective determinants.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2  3  4 |\n| 4  5  6 |\n| 3  8  7 |\n\nTo find the determinant D:\nD = 2(5*7 - 6*8) - 3(4*7 - 6*3) + 4(4*8 - 5*3)\nD = 2(-13) - 3(-10) + 4(19)\nD = -26 + 30 + 76\nD = 80\n\nNow, we will find the determinant Dx by replacing the first column with the constants:\n| 20  3  4 |\n| 34  5  6 |\n| 32  8  7 |\n\nDx = 20(5*7 - 6*8) - 3(34*7 - 6*32) + 4(34*8 - 5*32)\nDx = 20(-13) - 3(-10) + 4(19)\nDx = -260 + 90 + 304\nDx = 134\n\nSimilarly, we will find the determinant Dy by replacing the second column with the constants:\n| 2  20  4 |\n| 4  34  6 |\n| 3  32  7 |\n\nDy = 2(34*7 - 6*32) - 20(4*7 - 6*3) + 4(4*32 - 34*3)\nDy = 2(38) - 20(-10) + 4(29)\nDy = 76 + 200 + 116\nDy = 392\n\nLastly, we will find the determinant Dz by replacing the third column with the constants:\n| 2  3  20 |\n| 4  5  34 |\n| 3  8  32 |\n\nDz = 2(5*32 - 34*8) - 3(4*32 - 34*3) + 20(4*8 - 5*3)\nDz = 2(-22) - 3(-10) + 20(19)\nDz = -44 + 30 + 380\nDz = 366\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z by dividing the respective determinants by D:\nx = Dx/D = 134/80 = 1.675\ny = Dy/D = 392/80 = 4.9\nz = Dz/D = 366/80 = 4.575\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\nx = 1.675, y = 4.9, and z = 4.575."
