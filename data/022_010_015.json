    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = sin(z)/(z^2 - 4) valid in the annulus 2 < |z| < ∞, we first need to rewrite the function in a more convenient form. We can factor the denominator as (z - 2)(z + 2), so we have:\n\nf(z) = sin(z)/[(z - 2)(z + 2)]\n\nNow, we can use partial fraction decomposition to rewrite f(z) as the sum of two simpler functions:\n\nf(z) = A/(z - 2) + B/(z + 2)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can multiply both sides by the denominator (z - 2)(z + 2) and then solve for A and B:\n\nsin(z) = A(z + 2) + B(z - 2)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in convenient values of z. Let's use z = 2 and z = -2:\n\nFor z = 2:\nsin(2) = A(4) => A = sin(2)/4\n\nFor z = -2:\nsin(-2) = -B(4) => B = -sin(-2)/4\n\nNow we have:\n\nf(z) = (sin(2)/4)/(z - 2) - (sin(-2)/4)/(z + 2)\n\nNext, we need to find the Laurent series expansion for each term. Since we are working in the annulus 2 < |z| < ∞, we can use the geometric series formula for the expansion:\n\n1/(z - 2) = 1/(z(1 - 2/z)) = (1/z) * (1/(1 - 2/z))\n\nFor the first term, we have:\n\n(sin(2)/4) * (1/z) * (1/(1 - 2/z))\n\nNow, we can expand the geometric series:\n\n(sin(2)/4) * (1/z) * (1 + 2/z + (2/z)^2 + (2/z)^3 + ...)\n\nSimilarly, for the second term, we have:\n\n-(sin(-2)/4) * (1/(z + 2)) = -(sin(-2)/4) * (1/z) * (1/(1 + 2/z))\n\nExpanding the geometric series:\n\n-(sin(-2)/4) * (1/z) * (1 - 2/z + (2/z)^2 - (2/z)^3 + ...)\n\nNow, we can combine the two series to get the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = (sin(2)/4) * (1/z) * (1 + 2/z + (2/z)^2 + (2/z)^3 + ...) - (sin(-2)/4) * (1/z) * (1 - 2/z + (2/z)^2 - (2/z)^3 + ...)\n\nThe Laurent series converges absolutely for all z in the annulus 2 < |z| < ∞, since the geometric series converges absolutely for |2/z| < 1, which is equivalent to |z| > 2. The series converges conditionally for z = 2 and z = -2, as the geometric series converges conditionally at these points. The series diverges for |z| ≤ 2, as the geometric series diverges for |2/z| ≥ 1."
