    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 10 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 cm * 4 cm * 10 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 240 cubic cm\n\nVolume = 80 cubic cm\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 80 cubic centimeters."
