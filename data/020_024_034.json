    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a product at a variable cost of $5 per unit. The fixed cost of setting up the production is $100. The company's revenue as a function of the number of units sold is given by R(x) = 15x - 0.1x^2, where x is the number of units sold. What is the optimal number of units that the company should sell to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of units to maximize profit, we first need to find the profit function P(x). Profit is the difference between revenue and cost, so we can write the profit function as:\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x)\n\nwhere R(x) is the revenue function and C(x) is the cost function. We are given the revenue function R(x) = 15x - 0.1x^2 and the cost function can be written as C(x) = 5x + 100 (variable cost of $5 per unit and fixed cost of $100).\n\nNow, let's find the profit function:\n\nP(x) = (15x - 0.1x^2) - (5x + 100)\nP(x) = 15x - 0.1x^2 - 5x - 100\nP(x) = 10x - 0.1x^2 - 100\n\nTo find the optimal number of units to maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = d(10x - 0.1x^2 - 100)/dx\nP'(x) = 10 - 0.2x\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n10 - 0.2x = 0\n0.2x = 10\nx = 50\n\nSo, the optimal number of units to maximize profit is 50 units."
