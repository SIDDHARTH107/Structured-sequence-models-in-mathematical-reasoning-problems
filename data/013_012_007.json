    "message_1": "A company A and a company B are competing in a Stackelberg competition. Company A is the leader and company B is the follower. The total market demand is P=100-Q, where Q is the quantity produced by both companies. The cost function for company A is C_A=10Q and for company B is C_B=15Q. Determine the quantity of output produced by each company and the price in the market.",
    "message_2": "To determine the quantity of output produced by each company and the price in the market, we need to find the reaction functions for both companies and then solve for the equilibrium quantities.\n\nFirst, let's find the profit functions for both companies:\n\nΠ_A = P * Q_A - C_A = (100 - Q) * Q_A - 10 * Q_A\nΠ_B = P * Q_B - C_B = (100 - Q) * Q_B - 15 * Q_B\n\nSince Q = Q_A + Q_B, we can rewrite the profit functions as:\n\nΠ_A = (100 - (Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_A - 10 * Q_A\nΠ_B = (100 - (Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_B - 15 * Q_B\n\nNow, we need to find the reaction functions by taking the first-order conditions (FOC) for each company's profit function:\n\nFOC_A: ∂Π_A / ∂Q_A = 100 - 2 * Q_A - Q_B - 10 = 0\nFOC_B: ∂Π_B / ∂Q_B = 100 - Q_A - 2 * Q_B - 15 = 0\n\nNow, we have the reaction functions:\n\nQ_A = (90 - Q_B) / 2\nQ_B = (85 - Q_A) / 2\n\nSince Company A is the leader, they will choose their quantity first, taking into account Company B's reaction function. Substitute Company B's reaction function into Company A's reaction function:\n\nQ_A = (90 - (85 - Q_A) / 2) / 2\n\nSolve for Q_A:\n\nQ_A = (90 - 42.5 + Q_A / 2) / 2\nQ_A = (47.5 + Q_A / 2) / 2\n2 * Q_A = 47.5 + Q_A / 2\n4 * Q_A = 95 + Q_A\n3 * Q_A = 95\nQ_A = 31.67 (approximately)\n\nNow, substitute Q_A back into Company B's reaction function to find Q_B:\n\nQ_B = (85 - 31.67) / 2\nQ_B = 26.665 (approximately)\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium quantities for both companies, we can find the market price:\n\nP = 100 - Q\nP = 100 - (31.67 + 26.665)\nP = 100 - 58.335\nP = 41.665 (approximately)\n\nSo, Company A will produce approximately 31.67 units, Company B will produce approximately 26.665 units, and the market price will be approximately 41.665."
