    "message_2": "There are four possible Cayley tables for a group of order 4. Two of them correspond to the cyclic group C4, and one corresponds to the Klein four-group V4. The fourth table does not represent a group, as it does not satisfy the group axioms.\n\nHere are the Cayley tables:\n\n1. Cyclic group C4:\n\n   | e  a  b  c\n   -------------\n e | e  a  b  c\n a | a  b  c  e\n b | b  c  e  a\n c | c  e  a  b\n\n2. Another representation of C4:\n\n   | e  a  b  c\n   -------------\n e | e  a  b  c\n a | a  b  c  e\n b | b  c  e  a\n c | c  e  a  b\n\n3. Klein four-group V4:\n\n   | e  a  b  c\n   -------------\n e | e  a  b  c\n a | a  e  c  b\n b | b  c  e  a\n c | c  b  a  e\n\n4. Non-group table:\n\n   | e  a  b  c\n   -------------\n e | e  a  b  c\n a | a  e  c  b\n b | b  c  a  e\n c | c  b  e  a\n\nThe first and second tables represent the cyclic group C4, while the third table represents the Klein four-group V4. The fourth table does not represent a group, as it does not satisfy the group axioms (specifically, the inverse axiom)."
