    "message_2": "To determine if X is compact, we need to check if every open cover of X has a finite subcover. Let's consider the open intervals (1/(n+1), 1/n) for n ∈ ℕ. These intervals form an open cover for X, as every element 1/n is contained in the interval (1/(n+1), 1/n), and 0 is contained in the interval (0, 1).\n\nNow, let's try to find a finite subcover for this open cover. Notice that for any finite collection of these intervals, there will always be some elements of X that are not covered. Specifically, if we take the largest n in the finite collection, then the element 1/(n+1) will not be covered by any of the chosen intervals.\n\nSince we cannot find a finite subcover for this open cover, X is not compact."
