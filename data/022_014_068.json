    "message_2": "To find the harmonic function u(x,y), we first convert the given Cartesian coordinates (x,y) to polar coordinates (r,θ) where x = r*cos(θ) and y = r*sin(θ). Since u(x,y) is harmonic, it satisfies Laplace's equation:\n\n∆u = (d^2u/dr^2) + (1/r)*(du/dr) + (1/r^2)*(d^2u/dθ^2) = 0\n\nWe are given that u(0,0) = 0 and ∂u/∂r(1,0) = 2. In polar coordinates, these conditions become u(r,θ) = 0 when r = 0 and ∂u/∂r(r,θ) = 2 when r = 1 and θ = 0.\n\nWe can use separation of variables to solve Laplace's equation. Let u(r,θ) = R(r)Θ(θ). Then, the equation becomes:\n\nR''(r)Θ(θ) + (1/r)R'(r)Θ(θ) + (1/r^2)R(r)Θ''(θ) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by R(r)Θ(θ):\n\n(R''(r) + (1/r)R'(r))/R(r) + (1/r^2)Θ''(θ)/Θ(θ) = 0\n\nSince the left side is a function of r and the right side is a function of θ, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1) (R''(r) + (1/r)R'(r))/R(r) = -λ\n(2) (1/r^2)Θ''(θ)/Θ(θ) = λ\n\nNow, we solve these two ordinary differential equations separately.\n\nFor equation (1), we have:\n\nR''(r) + (1/r)R'(r) + λR(r) = 0\n\nThis is the Euler-Cauchy equation, and its solution is given by:\n\nR(r) = A*r^m + B*r^(-m)\n\nwhere m = sqrt(λ) and A and B are constants.\n\nFor equation (2), we have:\n\nΘ''(θ) + λ*r^2*Θ(θ) = 0\n\nThis is a linear homogeneous second-order differential equation with constant coefficients. Its general solution is given by:\n\nΘ(θ) = C*cos(m*θ) + D*sin(m*θ)\n\nwhere C and D are constants.\n\nNow, we combine the solutions for R(r) and Θ(θ) to get the general solution for u(r,θ):\n\nu(r,θ) = (A*r^m + B*r^(-m))*(C*cos(m*θ) + D*sin(m*θ))\n\nTo satisfy the boundary conditions, we have:\n\n1) u(0,0) = 0: This implies that A = 0, since R(0) = 0.\n\n2) ∂u/∂r(1,0) = 2: This implies that m*B*cos(m*θ) - m*B*cos(m*θ) = 2. Since cos(0) = 1, we have m*B = 2.\n\nThus, the harmonic function u(r,θ) is given by:\n\nu(r,θ) = 2*r^(-m)*sin(m*θ)\n\nwhere m = sqrt(λ) and λ is a constant. To find the specific harmonic function that satisfies the given conditions, we would need more information about the problem or additional boundary conditions."
