    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher structure with four rounds, a block size of 64 bits, and a key size of 128 bits. Each round consists of an expansion permutation with 32 output bits, a bitwise XOR operation with a round key of 32 bits, a substitution box (S-box) with 4 input and 4 output bits, a permutation with 16 output bits, and a bitwise XOR operation with the other half of the block. What is the total number of operations required to encrypt a 64-bit plaintext message using this Feistel cipher structure?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total number of operations required to encrypt a 64-bit plaintext message using this Feistel cipher structure, we need to consider the operations in each round and then multiply by the number of rounds.\n\nIn each round, we have the following operations:\n\n1. Expansion permutation: 32 output bits\n2. Bitwise XOR operation with a round key: 32 operations (one for each output bit)\n3. Substitution box (S-box): Since there are 32 output bits and each S-box has 4 input and 4 output bits, we have 32/4 = 8 S-boxes. Each S-box performs a substitution operation, so we have 8 operations in total.\n4. Permutation with 16 output bits: 16 operations (one for each output bit)\n5. Bitwise XOR operation with the other half of the block: 32 operations (one for each output bit)\n\nNow, let's add up the operations in each round:\n\n32 (expansion) + 32 (XOR with round key) + 8 (S-boxes) + 16 (permutation) + 32 (XOR with other half) = 120 operations per round\n\nSince there are 4 rounds in this Feistel cipher structure, the total number of operations required to encrypt a 64-bit plaintext message is:\n\n120 operations/round * 4 rounds = 480 operations"
