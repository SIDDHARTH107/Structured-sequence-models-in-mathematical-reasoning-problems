The intersection of two sets contains all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2} (since 2 is the only element common to both A and B)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and A, denoted as (A ∩ B) x A. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A ∩ B) x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products AxB and AxC:\n\nAxB = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nAxC = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of AxB and AxC, denoted as (AxB) ∩ (AxC). The intersection of two sets of ordered pairs contains all ordered pairs that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common ordered pairs between AxB and AxC.\n\n(AxB) ∩ (AxC) = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nSo, the two sets we were asked to find are:\n\n(A ∩ B) x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2)}\n(AxB) ∩ (AxC) = ∅"
