    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cylindrical tank using integration, we'll integrate the area of the circular cross-sections of the tank with respect to the height. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius of the tank is 5 meters.\n\nLet's set up the integral:\n\nV = ∫[0, 10] π(5^2) dh\n\nSince π(5^2) is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n\nV = π(5^2) ∫[0, 10] dh\n\nNow, we integrate with respect to h:\n\nV = π(5^2) [h] | [0, 10]\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nV = π(5^2) (10 - 0)\n\nV = π(25)(10)\n\nV = 250π cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of the cylindrical tank is 250π cubic meters."
