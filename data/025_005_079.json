    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2 - 3xy\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y, z) where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n3z^2 - 3xy = 0\n\nDivide each equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\nz^2 - xy = 0\n\nNow, we have a system of three equations with three variables. We can solve this system to find the singular points.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have x^2 = yz. Now, substitute this into the second equation:\n\ny^2 - (yz)z = 0\ny^2 - x^2z = 0\n\nNow, substitute x^2 = yz back into the equation:\n\ny^2 - yz^2 = 0\ny(y - z^2) = 0\n\nSo, either y = 0 or y = z^2.\n\nCase 1: y = 0\nFrom the third equation, z^2 - x(0) = 0, which implies z^2 = 0, so z = 0.\nThen, from the first equation, x^2 - 0(0) = 0, which implies x^2 = 0, so x = 0.\nThus, we have the singular point (0, 0, 0).\n\nCase 2: y = z^2\nFrom the third equation, z^2 - xz^2 = 0, which implies z^2(1 - x) = 0.\nSo, either z = 0 or x = 1.\n\nSubcase 2.1: z = 0\nFrom the first equation, x^2 - 0(0) = 0, which implies x^2 = 0, so x = 0.\nThus, we have the singular point (0, 0, 0), which we already found.\n\nSubcase 2.2: x = 1\nFrom the first equation, 1^2 - yz = 0, which implies yz = 1.\nSince y = z^2, we have z^2 * z = 1, which implies z^3 = 1.\nThus, z = 1 (since z is a real number), and y = z^2 = 1.\nSo, we have the singular point (1, 1, 1).\n\nIn conclusion, the singular points of the algebraic variety V defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0 are (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1)."
