    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, ϕ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To find the value of ϕ(n) for n = 24, we can use the formula:\n\nϕ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factors of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. So, the distinct prime factors are 2 and 3.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nϕ(24) = 24 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nϕ(24) = 24 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nϕ(24) = 12 * (2/3)\nϕ(24) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function ϕ(24) is 8."
