    "message_2": "To construct a Turing machine that accepts the language L = {0^(2^n) | n ≥ 0}, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start in the initial state q0.\n2. If the input is empty (i.e., n = 0), accept the input, as 0^(2^0) = 0^1 is part of the language.\n3. If the input is not empty, read the first 0 and replace it with an 'X' (a symbol not in the input alphabet), and move to state q1.\n4. In state q1, move right until you find a 0 or a blank symbol. If you find a 0, replace it with an 'X' and move to state q2. If you find a blank symbol, reject the input, as it is not in the language.\n5. In state q2, move right until you find a 0 or a blank symbol. If you find a 0, replace it with an 'X' and move back to state q1. If you find a blank symbol, move to state q3.\n6. In state q3, move left until you find an 'X'. Replace the 'X' with a 0 and move to state q4.\n7. In state q4, move left until you find an 'X' or a blank symbol. If you find an 'X', move to state q5. If you find a blank symbol, accept the input, as it is in the language.\n8. In state q5, move right until you find a 0 or a blank symbol. If you find a 0, replace it with an 'X' and move back to state q4. If you find a blank symbol, move to state q6.\n9. In state q6, move left until you find an 'X'. Replace the 'X' with a 0 and move to state q7.\n10. In state q7, move left until you find an 'X' or a blank symbol. If you find an 'X', move to state q0. If you find a blank symbol, accept the input, as it is in the language.\n\nThis Turing machine will accept the language L = {0^(2^n) | n ≥ 0}, as it checks for the correct number of zeros in the input string and only accepts strings that follow the given pattern."
