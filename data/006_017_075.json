    "message_1": "A city has a total of 5000 cars on its roads. The probability of  accidents involving two or more cars is 0.03. What is the probability that there will be at least one multi-car accident on any given day in this city?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one multi-car accident, we can first find the probability of no multi-car accidents and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of no multi-car accidents is (1 - 0.03) for each car. Since there are 5000 cars, we need to multiply this probability for all cars:\n\nP(no multi-car accidents) = (1 - 0.03)^5000 ≈ 0.000045\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one multi-car accident by subtracting the probability of no multi-car accidents from 1:\n\nP(at least one multi-car accident) = 1 - P(no multi-car accidents) = 1 - 0.000045 ≈ 0.999955\n\nSo, the probability of at least one multi-car accident on any given day in this city is approximately 0.999955 or 99.9955%."
