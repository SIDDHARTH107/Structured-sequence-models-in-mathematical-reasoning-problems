    "message_1": "Let's say a fluid flow inside a pipe is represented by a periodic function f(t) of period 2Ï€, where t is time. The function is defined as follows:\nf(t) = 5sin(t) - 3cos(2t) + 2sin(3t)\nUsing the Fourier transform, find the frequency content of the fluid flow and determine the amplitude and phase angle for each frequency component.",
    "message_2": "Since the given function f(t) is already expressed as a sum of sinusoidal functions, we can directly identify the frequency components, amplitudes, and phase angles without computing the Fourier transform.\n\nThe function f(t) can be rewritten as:\n\nf(t) = 5sin(t) - 3cos(2t) + 2sin(3t)\n     = 5sin(1t + 0) - 3cos(2t + 0) + 2sin(3t + 0)\n\nNow, we can identify the frequency components, amplitudes, and phase angles for each term:\n\n1. Frequency component: 1 (from sin(t))\n   Amplitude: 5\n   Phase angle: 0\n\n2. Frequency component: 2 (from cos(2t))\n   Amplitude: 3\n   Phase angle: 0\n\n3. Frequency component: 3 (from sin(3t))\n   Amplitude: 2\n   Phase angle: 0\n\nSo, the frequency content of the fluid flow consists of three frequency components: 1, 2, and 3. The amplitudes for these components are 5, 3, and 2, respectively, and the phase angles are all 0."
