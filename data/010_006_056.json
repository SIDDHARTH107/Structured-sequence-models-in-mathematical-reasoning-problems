    "message_2": "To find the homotopy group π2(X), we first need to understand the space X obtained by identifying antipodal points on the circle. This space is known as the real projective plane, denoted as RP^2.\n\nThe real projective plane, RP^2, is a non-orientable surface, and it can be obtained by gluing a disk along its boundary to a Möbius strip. Now, we want to find the second homotopy group of RP^2, which is the set of homotopy classes of maps from the 2-dimensional sphere S^2 to RP^2.\n\nSince RP^2 is a non-orientable surface, it is not possible to embed S^2 into RP^2 without tearing or self-intersection. However, we can still consider continuous maps from S^2 to RP^2. \n\nRecall that the second homotopy group of a space is the set of homotopy classes of maps from the 2-sphere to the space. The second homotopy group of the real projective plane, π2(RP^2), can be computed using the following fact:\n\nFor any CW complex X, π2(X) is isomorphic to the second homology group H_2(X).\n\nIn the case of the real projective plane, RP^2, its second homology group is H_2(RP^2) = Z, the group of integers. Therefore, the second homotopy group of the real projective plane is π2(RP^2) = Z.\n\nSo, the homotopy group π2(X) for the space X obtained by identifying antipodal points on the circle is the group of integers, Z."
