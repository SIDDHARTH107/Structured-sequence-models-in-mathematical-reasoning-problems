    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit earned from selling each unit of Product A is $5 and the profit earned from selling each unit of Product B is $8. Last week, the company sold a total of 450 units of products and earned a profit of $3,500. How many units of each product were sold?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A sold and y be the number of units of Product B sold. We can set up the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = 450 (total units sold)\n5x + 8y = 3500 (total profit)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. I will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 450 - y\n\nNow substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n5(450 - y) + 8y = 3500\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n2250 - 5y + 8y = 3500\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3y = 1250\n\nNow divide by 3:\n\ny = 416.67\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a unit, this means there is an error in the problem statement or the given information is incorrect. Please double-check the problem statement and the given information."
