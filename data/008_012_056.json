    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  4 |, X = | x |, B = | 20 |\n    | 7 -2 |      | y |      | 10 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -2) - (4 * 7) = -6 - 28 = -34\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix of A. The cofactor matrix of A is:\n\nCofactor(A) = | -2 -4 |\n                         | -7  3 |\n\nNow, we find the transpose of the cofactor matrix:\n\nadj(A) = | -2  -7 |\n              | -4   3 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-34) * | -2  -7 |\n                             | -4   3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 1/17   7/34 |\n              | 2/17  -3/34 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  1/17   7/34 | * | 20 |\n       |  2/17  -3/34 |    | 10 |\n\nX = | (1/17 * 20) + (7/34 * 10) |\n       | (2/17 * 20) + (-3/34 * 10) |\n\nX = | 20/17 + 35/17 |\n       | 40/17 - 15/17 |\n\nX = | 55/17 |\n       | 25/17 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 55/17 and y = 25/17."
