    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 10, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. A group of order n is a group with n elements.\n3. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n4. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 modulo p and divides n.\n\nSince 10 = 2 * 5, there are two prime factors: 2 and 5. We will find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups (of order 2):\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 5 (since it must divide the order of the group, which is 10) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n- The only possibility is that there is 1 Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nFor Sylow 5-subgroups (of order 5):\n- The number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 2 (since it must divide the order of the group, which is 10) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n- The only possibility is that there is 1 Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nSince there is only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup and 1 Sylow 5-subgroup, the group must be a semi-direct product of these two subgroups. The Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_2 (the cyclic group of order 2), and the Sylow 5-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_5 (the cyclic group of order 5).\n\nThere are two possibilities for the semi-direct product:\n\n1. The trivial semi-direct product, which is the direct product Z_2 Ã— Z_5. This results in a group isomorphic to Z_10 (the cyclic group of order 10).\n2. A non-trivial semi-direct product, which results in a group isomorphic to the dihedral group D_10 (the group of symmetries of a regular decagon).\n\nTherefore, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 10: Z_10 and D_10."
