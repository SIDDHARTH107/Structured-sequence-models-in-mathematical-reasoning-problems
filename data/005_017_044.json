    "message_1": "A researcher conducted a study on a group of 50 individuals and obtained data on their age, income, and education level. The researcher wants to perform a principal component analysis on the data. How many principal components should the researcher include in the analysis if they want to account for at least 80% of the total variability in the data?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of principal components needed to account for at least 80% of the total variability in the data, the researcher needs to perform the principal component analysis (PCA) first and then examine the explained variance ratio for each component.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Perform PCA on the data.\n2. Calculate the explained variance ratio for each principal component.\n3. Determine the cumulative explained variance ratio.\n4. Identify the number of components needed to reach at least 80% of the total variability.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data, we cannot perform PCA and provide the exact number of principal components needed. However, once the researcher follows these steps, they will be able to determine the appropriate number of principal components to include in their analysis to account for at least 80% of the total variability in the data."
