    "message_2": "To find the height above the ground that the ladder reaches, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function relates the angle, the opposite side (height in this case), and the hypotenuse (the ladder's length) in a right triangle.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this problem, the angle is 60 degrees, and the ladder's length (hypotenuse) is 20 meters. We want to find the height (opposite side) that the ladder reaches.\n\nsin(60) = height / 20\n\nFirst, we need to find the sine of 60 degrees. You can use a calculator or remember that sin(60) = √3/2.\n\n(√3/2) = height / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 20 * (√3/2)\n\nheight = 10 * √3\n\nThe ladder reaches approximately 17.32 meters above the ground."
