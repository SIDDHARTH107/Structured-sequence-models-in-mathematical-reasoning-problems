    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of equations:\n\n(1) 3x + 2y + 5zi = 7 + 2i\n(2) 2x - 4y + z = -1 + 6i\n(3) x + 3y - 2zi = 4 - 9i\n\nWe will eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (3) by 2:\n\n(3') 2(x + 3y - 2zi) = 2(4 - 9i)\n(3') 2x + 6y - 4zi = 8 - 18i\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from (3'):\n\n(4) 10y - 3zi = 9 - 24i\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from equations (1) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (3) by 3:\n\n(3'') 3(x + 3y - 2zi) = 3(4 - 9i)\n(3'') 3x + 9y - 6zi = 12 - 27i\n\nNow, subtract equation (1) from (3''):\n\n(5) 7y - zi = 5 - 25i\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, y and z:\n\n(4) 10y - 3zi = 9 - 24i\n(5) 7y - zi = 5 - 25i\n\nWe will eliminate y from equations (4) and (5). To do this, we will multiply equation (5) by 10/7:\n\n(5') 10y - (10/7)zi = (50/7) - (250/7)i\n\nNow, subtract equation (4) from (5'):\n\n(6) (7/3)zi = (10/7) - (10/7)i\n\nNow, divide both sides of equation (6) by (7/3):\n\nz = (10/7)(3/7) - (10/7)i(3/7)\nz = (30/49) - (30/49)i\n\nNow that we have z, we can find y using equation (5):\n\n7y - (1)(30/49 - 30/49i) = 5 - 25i\n7y = 5 - 25i + 30/49 - 30/49i\n7y = (245/49) - (1190/49)i\ny = (35/7) - (170/7)i\n\nNow that we have y and z, we can find x using equation (3):\n\nx + 3(35/7 - 170/7i) - 2(30/49 - 30/49i) = 4 - 9i\nx = 4 - 9i - 3(35/7) + 3(170/7)i + 60/49 - 60/49i\nx = (28/7) + (510/7)i\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = (28/7) + (510/7)i\ny = (35/7) - (170/7)i\nz = (30/49) - (30/49)i"
