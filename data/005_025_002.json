    "message_1": "Suppose the weights of apples harvested from a certain orchard follow a normal distribution with a mean of 120 grams and a standard deviation of 10 grams. If a sample of 25 apples is taken from this orchard, what is the probability that the average weight of the sample is between 117 and 123 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we have a sample size of 25 apples, and we know that the population mean (μ) is 120 grams, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 10 grams. We want to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is between 117 and 123 grams.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx̄), which is given by the formula:\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n\n\nwhere n is the sample size.\n\nσx̄ = 10 / √25\nσx̄ = 10 / 5\nσx̄ = 2 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of sample mean values (117 and 123 grams). The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σx̄\n\nFor x̄ = 117 grams:\n\nz1 = (117 - 120) / 2\nz1 = -3 / 2\nz1 = -1.5\n\nFor x̄ = 123 grams:\n\nz2 = (123 - 120) / 2\nz2 = 3 / 2\nz2 = 1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is between -1.5 and 1.5. We can look up the z-scores in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator or software to find the corresponding probabilities.\n\nP(-1.5 < z < 1.5) = P(z < 1.5) - P(z < -1.5)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator:\n\nP(z < 1.5) ≈ 0.9332\nP(z < -1.5) ≈ 0.0668\n\nP(-1.5 < z < 1.5) = 0.9332 - 0.0668\nP(-1.5 < z < 1.5) ≈ 0.8664\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the sample of 25 apples is between 117 and 123 grams is approximately 86.64%."
