    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by removing the middle third of a line segment repeatedly. After each iteration, the remaining length is 2/3 of the previous length. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the length is 2/3 * 9 cm = 6 cm.\nAfter the second iteration, the length is 2/3 * 6 cm = 4 cm.\nAfter the third iteration, the length is 2/3 * 4 cm = 8/3 cm.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length is 2/3 * 8/3 cm = 16/9 cm.\nAfter the fifth iteration, the length is 2/3 * 16/9 cm = 32/27 cm.\nAfter the sixth iteration, the length is 2/3 * 32/27 cm = 64/81 cm.\n\nSo, the length of the Cantor set after the 6th iteration is 64/81 cm."
