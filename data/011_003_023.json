    "message_2": "The sum of the numbers in the nth row of Pascal's Triangle is given by the formula 2^(n-1), where n is the row number. In this case, the student is asked to find the sum of the numbers in the 7th row. \n\nUsing the formula, the sum of the numbers in the 7th row is:\n\n2^(7-1) = 2^6 = 64\n\nSo, the sum of the numbers in the 7th row of Pascal's Triangle is 64."
