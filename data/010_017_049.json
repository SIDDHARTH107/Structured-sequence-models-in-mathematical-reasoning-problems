    "message_2": "To find a lower bound for the number of critical points of a Morse function on a surface S with genus g=3, we can use the Morse inequalities. The Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of a Morse function to the Betti numbers of the surface.\n\nThe Betti numbers of a surface S with genus g are given by:\nb_0(S) = 1 (since S is connected)\nb_1(S) = 2g (since S is an orientable surface)\nb_2(S) = 1 (since S is a compact, orientable surface)\n\nFor a surface with genus g=3, we have:\nb_0(S) = 1\nb_1(S) = 6\nb_2(S) = 1\n\nNow, let f_k(S) denote the number of critical points of index k on S. The Morse inequalities state that:\n\nf_k(S) ≥ b_k(S) for k = 0, 1, 2\n\nSo, we have:\nf_0(S) ≥ 1\nf_1(S) ≥ 6\nf_2(S) ≥ 1\n\nThe total number of critical points f(S) is the sum of the critical points of each index:\n\nf(S) = f_0(S) + f_1(S) + f_2(S)\n\nUsing the lower bounds from the Morse inequalities, we get:\n\nf(S) ≥ 1 + 6 + 1 = 8\n\nTherefore, the lower bound for the number of critical points of a Morse function on a surface with genus 3 is 8."
