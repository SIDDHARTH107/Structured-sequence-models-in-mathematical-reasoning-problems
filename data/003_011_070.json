    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pythagorean theorem. We have a right triangle with the tree as one side, the distance between the person and the tree as the other side, and the distance between the top of the tree and the person's eyes as the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's denote the height of the tree as A, the distance between the person and the tree as B, and the distance between the top of the tree and the person's eyes as C. We are given:\n\nA = 25 meters (height of the tree)\nB = 20 meters (distance between the person and the tree)\n\nHowever, we need to find the distance between the top of the tree and the person's eyes, not the ground. So, we need to subtract the person's height from the height of the tree:\n\nA = 25 - 1.7 = 23.3 meters\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nA^2 + B^2 = C^2\n\n(23.3)^2 + (20)^2 = C^2\n542.89 + 400 = C^2\n942.89 = C^2\n\nNow, we find the square root of both sides to find the value of C:\n\nC = √942.89\nC ≈ 30.71 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the top of the tree and the person's eyes is approximately 30.71 meters."
