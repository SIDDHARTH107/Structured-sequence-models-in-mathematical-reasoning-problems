    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ A:\n\n(A △ B) △ A = ({1, 4} ∪ A) - ({1, 4} ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1} = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B △ A:\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A △ (B △ A):\n\nA △ (B △ A) = (A ∪ {1, 4}) - (A ∩ {1, 4}) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1} = {2, 3, 4}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A) are both equal to {2, 3, 4}. This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative, as the result is the same for both expressions."
