    "message_2": "According to Wilson's theorem, for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. So, we need to find the smallest prime number p for which this condition holds.\n\nLet's start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\nFor p = 2, (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer n for which (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n according to Wilson's theorem is n = 2."
