    "message_1": "A principal hires an agent to complete a task. The agent's level of effort determines the probability of the task's successful completion. The task has a value of $100,000, but the principal values the task at only $90,000. If the agent expends low effort, the probability of successful completion is 0.25, while high effort increases the probability to 0.75. However, high effort requires the agent to bear a personal cost of $20,000. What level of effort should the agent choose to maximize their expected utility, assuming their utility function is linear, risk-neutral, and they are risk-averse against personal cost?",
    "message_2": "To determine the level of effort the agent should choose, we need to compare the expected utility of both low effort and high effort. Since the agent is risk-neutral, their expected utility is simply the expected monetary value minus the personal cost.\n\n1. Low effort:\nProbability of success: 0.25\nValue of the task: $90,000 (since the principal values the task at $90,000)\nPersonal cost: $0 (no additional cost for low effort)\n\nExpected utility (low effort) = (Probability of success * Value of the task) - Personal cost\n= (0.25 * $90,000) - $0\n= $22,500\n\n2. High effort:\nProbability of success: 0.75\nValue of the task: $90,000\nPersonal cost: $20,000\n\nExpected utility (high effort) = (Probability of success * Value of the task) - Personal cost\n= (0.75 * $90,000) - $20,000\n= $67,500 - $20,000\n= $47,500\n\nComparing the expected utilities of both levels of effort, we can see that the agent should choose high effort to maximize their expected utility, as $47,500 (high effort) > $22,500 (low effort)."
