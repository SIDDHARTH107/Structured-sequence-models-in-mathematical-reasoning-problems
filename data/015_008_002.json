    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant, denoted by δ, is a mathematical constant that appears in the study of bifurcation diagrams and chaos theory. It is named after the mathematician Mitchell Feigenbaum, who discovered it in the 1970s. The Feigenbaum constant is approximately equal to 4.669201609...\n\nFeigenbaum's second constant, denoted by α, is another mathematical constant related to the scaling of the period-doubling bifurcation. It is approximately equal to 2.502907875...\n\nCalculating Feigenbaum's second constant correct to three decimal places, we get:\n\nα ≈ 2.503"
