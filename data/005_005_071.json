    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs and the probability that any given bulb will be defective is 0.05. If a customer purchases a box with 20 bulbs, find the probability that:\n\na) All bulbs are non-defective\nb) At least one bulb is defective\nc) Exactly one bulb is defective. \n\nShow all steps and calculations.",
    "message_2": "To solve these problems, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k successes (defective bulbs) in n trials (total bulbs)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (defective bulb) = 0.05\n- n is the total number of trials (bulbs) = 20\n- k is the number of successes (defective bulbs)\n\na) All bulbs are non-defective:\nIn this case, we want the probability of having 0 defective bulbs (k=0).\n\nP(X = 0) = C(20, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(20-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^20\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.3585\n\nSo, the probability that all bulbs are non-defective is approximately 0.3585 or 35.85%.\n\nb) At least one bulb is defective:\nIn this case, we want the probability of having at least 1 defective bulb. This is equal to 1 minus the probability of having 0 defective bulbs.\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - 0.3585\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 0.6415\n\nSo, the probability that at least one bulb is defective is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%.\n\nc) Exactly one bulb is defective:\nIn this case, we want the probability of having exactly 1 defective bulb (k=1).\n\nP(X = 1) = C(20, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(20-1)\nP(X = 1) = 20 * 0.05 * (0.95)^19\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.3774\n\nSo, the probability that exactly one bulb is defective is approximately 0.3774 or 37.74%."
