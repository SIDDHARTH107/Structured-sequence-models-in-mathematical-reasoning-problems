    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate z from the first two equations. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of z equal in both equations:\n\nSecond equation * 4:\n4x - 20y + 4z = -24\n\nNow, we will add the first equation and the modified second equation:\n\n2x + 3y - 4z = 4\n4x - 20y + 4z = -24\n----------------------\n6x - 17y = -20 (Equation 1)\n\nNext, we will eliminate y from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and the third equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y equal in both equations:\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n4x + 6y - 8z = 8\n\nThird equation * 3:\n15x + 6y = 21\n\nNow, we will subtract the modified third equation from the modified first equation:\n\n4x + 6y - 8z = 8\n-(15x + 6y = 21)\n----------------------\n-11x - 8z = -13 (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n6x - 17y = -20 (Equation 1)\n-11x - 8z = -13 (Equation 2)\n\nWe will solve for x in Equation 1:\n\n6x - 17y = -20\n6x = 17y - 20\nx = (17y - 20)/6 (Equation 3)\n\nNow we will substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:\n\n-11((17y - 20)/6) - 8z = -13\n\nNow, we will multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n-11(17y - 20) - 48z = -78\n\nNow distribute -11:\n\n-187y + 220 - 48z = -78\n\nNow, isolate z:\n\n48z = -187y + 298\n\nDivide by 48:\n\nz = (-187y + 298)/48 (Equation 4)\n\nNow we have expressions for x and z in terms of y:\n\nx = (17y - 20)/6 (Equation 3)\nz = (-187y + 298)/48 (Equation 4)\n\nWe can substitute these expressions back into the original second equation:\n\nx - 5y + z = -6\n(17y - 20)/6 - 5y + (-187y + 298)/48 = -6\n\nNow, multiply both sides by the least common multiple of 6 and 48, which is 48:\n\n48(17y - 20)/6 - 48(5y) + 48(-187y + 298)/48 = -6 * 48\n\nSimplify:\n\n8(17y - 20) - 240y + (-187y + 298) = -288\n\nDistribute:\n\n136y - 160 - 240y - 187y + 298 = -288\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-291y + 138 = -288\n\nSubtract 138 from both sides:\n\n-291y = -426\n\nDivide by -291:\n\ny = 426/291\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into Equations 3 and 4 to find the values of x and z:\n\nx = (17y - 20)/6\nx = (17(2) - 20)/6\nx = (34 - 20)/6\nx = 14/6\nx = 7/3\n\nz = (-187y + 298)/48\nz = (-187(2) + 298)/48\nz = (-374 + 298)/48\nz = -76/48\nz = -19/12\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 7/3, y = 2, z = -19/12"
