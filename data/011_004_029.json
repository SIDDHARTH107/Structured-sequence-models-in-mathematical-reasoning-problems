    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nWe need to choose 2 red balls from 10, 2 blue balls from 8, and 1 green ball from 6. So, we can calculate the combinations for each color separately and then multiply them together to get the total number of ways.\n\nFor red balls: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 45\nFor blue balls: C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28\nFor green balls: C(6, 1) = 6! / (1!(6-1)!) = 6\n\nNow, multiply the combinations together: 45 * 28 * 6 = 7560\n\nSo, there are 7560 ways to select 5 balls with exactly 2 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 1 green ball."
