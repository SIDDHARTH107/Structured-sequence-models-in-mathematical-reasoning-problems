    "message_2": "To find the union of sets A and B, we combine all the elements from both sets without repeating any element. So, the union of sets A and B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nFor A:\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of A is also an element of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nFor B:\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of B is also an element of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B."
