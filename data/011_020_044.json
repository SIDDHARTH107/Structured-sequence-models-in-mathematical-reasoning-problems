    "message_1": "In a company, there are ten employees who can work on three different projects. Each project requires a team of three employees. How many different combinations of teams can be formed to work on the projects?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different combinations of teams that can be formed to work on the projects, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees, k is the number of employees needed for each project, and C(n, k) is the number of combinations.\n\nFor the first project, we have:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!) = 10! / (3!7!) = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 different ways to form a team of 3 employees for the first project.\n\nNow, after the first project team is formed, we have 7 employees left for the second project. So, we have:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = 35\n\nThere are 35 different ways to form a team of 3 employees for the second project.\n\nFinally, after the second project team is formed, we have 4 employees left for the third project. So, we have:\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4! / (3!1!) = 4\n\nThere are 4 different ways to form a team of 3 employees for the third project.\n\nTo find the total number of different combinations of teams that can be formed to work on the three projects, we multiply the number of combinations for each project:\n\nTotal combinations = 120 * 35 * 4 = 16800\n\nSo, there are 16,800 different combinations of teams that can be formed to work on the three projects."
