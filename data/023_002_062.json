    "message_2": "To determine if the Fourier series representation of the function converges pointwise or uniformly on the interval [-π, π], we need to analyze the convergence of the series.\n\nLet's first consider the pointwise convergence. A Fourier series converges pointwise to a function f(x) on the interval [-π, π] if, for every x in the interval, the limit of the partial sums of the series converges to f(x).\n\nThe given Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = 3/4 - (2/π) * ∑[n=1, ∞] (cos(nx)/(n^2-4))\n\nThe series inside the summation is a series of continuous functions (cos(nx)/(n^2-4)). According to the Dirichlet's theorem, if the function f(x) is piecewise continuous and has a piecewise continuous derivative on the interval [-π, π], then the Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) at every point x in the interval.\n\nSince cos(nx) is continuous and has a continuous derivative for all n, and (n^2-4) is a continuous function, the series converges pointwise on the interval [-π, π].\n\nNow let's consider the uniform convergence. A Fourier series converges uniformly to a function f(x) on the interval [-π, π] if, for every ε > 0, there exists an integer N such that for all n ≥ N and for all x in the interval, the absolute difference between the partial sums of the series and f(x) is less than ε.\n\nTo check for uniform convergence, we can use the Weierstrass M-test. The M-test states that if there exists a sequence of positive constants M_n such that |cos(nx)/(n^2-4)| ≤ M_n for all n and x in the interval, and if the series ∑[n=1, ∞] M_n converges, then the series ∑[n=1, ∞] (cos(nx)/(n^2-4)) converges uniformly.\n\nFor the given series, we can choose M_n = 1/(n^2-4). Then, |cos(nx)/(n^2-4)| ≤ 1/(n^2-4) for all n and x in the interval. The series ∑[n=1, ∞] 1/(n^2-4) converges by the p-series test, since p = 2 > 1.\n\nTherefore, by the Weierstrass M-test, the given Fourier series converges uniformly on the interval [-π, π].\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series representation of the function converges both pointwise and uniformly on the interval [-π, π]."
