    "message_1": "In a group of six students, each student is assigned to one of three projects. How many different project assignments are possible if each project must have at least one student assigned to it?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to assign the six students to the three projects without any restrictions. Each student can be assigned to one of the three projects, so there are 3^6 = 729 possible assignments.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of assignments where at least one project has no students. There are 3 ways to choose which project has no students, and the remaining 6 students can be assigned to the other two projects in 2^6 = 64 ways. So, there are 3 * 64 = 192 assignments where at least one project has no students.\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the cases where two projects have no students. There is only 1 way to assign all 6 students to the same project, and there are 3 ways to choose which project that is. So, there are 3 * 1 = 3 assignments where two projects have no students.\n\nUsing the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the total number of valid project assignments is:\n\n729 (total assignments) - 192 (assignments with at least one empty project) + 3 (assignments with two empty projects) = 540.\n\nSo, there are 540 different project assignments possible where each project has at least one student assigned to it."
