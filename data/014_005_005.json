Calculate the totient of n, φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nφ(n) = (23-1) * (31-1) = 22 * 30 = 660\n\n3. Find the private key (d) such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\nWe need to find a value for d such that (d * 17) % 660 = 1. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of e (17) with respect to φ(n) (660).\n\nExtended Euclidean Algorithm:\ngcd(17, 660) = 1\n1 = 17 * d - 660 * k (for some integer k)\n\nBy applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get:\nd = 389\n\nNow that we have the private key (d) and the modulus (n), we can compute the signature value (S) for the hash value (H) of the message.\n\n4. Compute the signature value (S) using the formula S = H^d mod n\nS = 12345^389 mod 713\n\nUsing modular exponentiation, we get:\nS = 470\n\nSo, the signature value that Alice needs to attach to the message is 470."
