    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. The profit per unit of product X is $20 and the profit per unit of product Y is $30. The company has a limited capacity of 200 units per day for producing both products. Due to uncertainties in the market, the demand for each product varies daily. The maximum daily demand for product X is 150 units, and for product Y, it is 100 units. However, to be on the safe side, the company wishes to produce extra units of each product in case the demand for either product increases. \n\nUsing robust optimization techniques, determine the number of units for each product that the company should produce to maximize its profit, assuming that the demand can be anywhere between 0 and the maximum daily demand values stated above.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using robust optimization techniques, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the demand of each product. Since the company wants to be on the safe side, we will assume that the demand for each product can be anywhere between 0 and the maximum daily demand values.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X produced, and y be the number of units of product Y produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (limited capacity constraint)\n2. 0 ≤ x ≤ 150 (product X demand constraint)\n3. 0 ≤ y ≤ 100 (product Y demand constraint)\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for x and y that satisfies all the constraints. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices (0, 0), (0, 100), (150, 0), and (50, 100).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 100) = 20(0) + 30(100) = $3,000\n3. P(150, 0) = 20(150) + 30(0) = $3,000\n4. P(50, 100) = 20(50) + 30(100) = $4,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $4,000, which occurs when the company produces 50 units of product X and 100 units of product Y. Therefore, the company should produce 50 units of product X and 100 units of product Y to maximize its profit while considering the worst-case scenario for the demand of each product."
