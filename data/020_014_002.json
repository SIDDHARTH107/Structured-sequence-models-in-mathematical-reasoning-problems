The company has 7 machines, and each machine is capable of producing either product A or B but not both. The production rate for product A and B on each machine is given by the following table:\n\n| Machine | Product A (units/hour) | Product B (units/hour) |\n|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1       | 4                     | 2                     |\n| 2       | 2                     | 3                     |\n| 3       | 7                     | 5                     |\n| 4       | 6                     | 6                     |\n| 5       | 8                     | 3                     |\n| 6       | 3                     | 5                     |\n| 7       | 5                     | 8                     |\n\nThe company wants to determine the optimal production plan to maximize profits subject to the constraint that the total number of products produced should not exceed 120 units per hour. What is the maximum profit that the company can earn per hour?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production plan, we need to calculate the profit per unit per hour for each machine and then allocate the machines to produce the product with the highest profit per unit per hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the profit per unit per hour for each machine:\n\n| Machine | Product A Profit/hour | Product B Profit/hour |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| 1       | 4 * $10 = $40        | 2 * $20 = $40        |\n| 2       | 2 * $10 = $20        | 3 * $20 = $60        |\n| 3       | 7 * $10 = $70        | 5 * $20 = $100       |\n| 4       | 6 * $10 = $60        | 6 * $20 = $120       |\n| 5       | 8 * $10 = $80        | 3 * $20 = $60        |\n| 6       | 3 * $10 = $30        | 5 * $20 = $100       |\n| 7       | 5 * $10 = $50        | 8 * $20 = $160       |\n\nNow, let's allocate the machines to produce the product with the highest profit per unit per hour:\n\n- Machine 1: Product A (since the profit per hour is the same for both products, we can choose either one)\n- Machine 2: Product B\n- Machine 3: Product B\n- Machine 4: Product B\n- Machine 5: Product A\n- Machine 6: Product B\n- Machine 7: Product B\n\nNow, let's calculate the total production rate for each product:\n\n- Product A: 4 (Machine 1) + 8 (Machine 5) = 12 units/hour\n- Product B: 3 (Machine 2) + 5 (Machine 3) + 6 (Machine 4) + 5 (Machine 6) + 8 (Machine 7) = 27 units/hour\n\nThe total production rate is 12 + 27 = 39 units/hour, which is less than the constraint of 120 units/hour.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the maximum profit per hour:\n\n- Product A: 12 units/hour * $10/unit = $120/hour\n- Product B: 27 units/hour * $20/unit = $540/hour\n\nThe maximum profit per hour is $120 + $540 = $660."
