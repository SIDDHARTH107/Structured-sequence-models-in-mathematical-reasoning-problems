    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors A and B, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of A and B, and θ is the angle between the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (2 * 3) + (5 * 1) = 6 + 5 = 11\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(2^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n|B| = √(3^2 + 1^2) = √(9 + 1) = √10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n11 = √29 * √10 * cos(θ)\n\nTo find the cosine of the angle, divide both sides by the product of the magnitudes:\n\ncos(θ) = 11 / (√29 * √10)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(11 / (√29 * √10))\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 radians or 52.76 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors A and B is approximately 0.920 radians or 52.76 degrees."
