    "message_2": "The quasi-Newton method is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum or maximum of a function. It is an iterative method that uses an approximation of the Hessian matrix to update the solution. However, for this problem, we can find the minimum value of the quadratic function using basic calculus, which is more straightforward.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5, we can first find its derivative with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 2\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x to find the critical points:\n\n2x - 2 = 0\n2x = 2\nx = 1\n\nSince the function is a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient (x^2 term), we know that it has a parabolic shape that opens upwards, which means that the critical point we found corresponds to the minimum value of the function. Now, we can plug this value of x back into the original function to find the minimum value:\n\nf(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 5\nf(1) = 1 - 2 + 5\nf(1) = 4\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5 is 4, which occurs at x = 1."
