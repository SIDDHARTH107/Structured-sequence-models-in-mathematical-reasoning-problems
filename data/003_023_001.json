    "message_2": "To find the cross product of vector A and vector B, we can use the following formula:\n\nA x B = [(A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y), (A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z), (A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x)]\n\nwhere A_x, A_y, and A_z are the components of vector A, and B_x, B_y, and B_z are the components of vector B.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nA x B = [(5 * 0 - (-3) * (-1)), ((-3) * 4 - 2 * 0), (2 * (-1) - 5 * 4)]\n\nA x B = [(0 - 3), (-12 - 0), (-2 - 20)]\n\nA x B = [-3, -12, -22]\n\nSo, the cross product of vector A and vector B is [-3, -12, -22]."
