    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover for a given graph.\n\nTo find the minimum vertex cover, we can use the complementary concept of a maximum matching. A matching is a set of edges in the graph such that no two edges share a common vertex. The maximum matching is the largest possible matching for a given graph.\n\nAccording to König's theorem, in a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching. However, the given graph is not guaranteed to be bipartite, so we cannot directly apply König's theorem.\n\nInstead, we can use a greedy approach to find an approximation of the minimum vertex cover. We will iteratively select the vertex with the highest degree and remove it along with its incident edges until there are no edges left in the graph.\n\n1. Select the vertex with degree 4 and remove it along with its incident edges. The remaining degrees are 0, 1, 2, 2, and 3.\n2. Select the vertex with degree 3 and remove it along with its incident edges. The remaining degrees are 0, 0, 1, and 1.\n3. Select one of the vertices with degree 1 and remove it along with its incident edge. The remaining degrees are 0, 0, and 0.\n\nWe have selected 3 vertices, and there are no edges left in the graph. Therefore, the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph is 3."
