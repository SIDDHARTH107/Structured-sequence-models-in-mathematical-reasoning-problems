The student needs to calculate the Fourier transform for this velocity distribution, and use it to calculate the maximum frequency present in the velocity field. Additionally, the student needs to find the frequency components that contribute the most to the velocity distribution.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given velocity distribution, we can use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nU(k) = ∫[u(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nwhere U(k) is the Fourier transform of u(x), i is the imaginary unit, and k is the frequency variable.\n\nGiven the velocity distribution:\n\nu(x) = sin(x) + 2sin(2x) + 3cos(4x)\n\nWe can find the Fourier transform of each term separately and then add them together.\n\nFor the first term, sin(x):\n\nU1(k) = ∫[sin(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite sin(x) as:\n\nsin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix)) / (2i)\n\nSo, U1(k) = ∫[((e^(ix) - e^(-ix)) / (2i)) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nU1(k) = (1/2i) * [∫(e^(ix) * e^(-ikx) dx) - ∫(e^(-ix) * e^(-ikx) dx)]\n\nU1(k) = (1/2i) * [∫(e^((1-k)ix) dx) - ∫(e^((-1-k)ix) dx)]\n\nNow, we can integrate each term:\n\nU1(k) = (1/2i) * [(1/(1-k)i) * e^((1-k)ix) - (1/(-1-k)i) * e^((-1-k)ix)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\n\nFor the second term, 2sin(2x):\n\nU2(k) = 2 * ∫[sin(2x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nFollowing the same steps as for the first term, we get:\n\nU2(k) = (1/i) * [(1/(2-k)i) * e^((2-k)ix) - (1/(-2-k)i) * e^((-2-k)ix)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\n\nFor the third term, 3cos(4x):\n\nU3(k) = 3 * ∫[cos(4x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite cos(4x) as:\n\ncos(4x) = (e^(i4x) + e^(-i4x)) / 2\n\nSo, U3(k) = (3/2) * [∫(e^(i4x) * e^(-ikx) dx) + ∫(e^(-i4x) * e^(-ikx) dx)]\n\nU3(k) = (3/2) * [∫(e^((4-k)ix) dx) + ∫(e^((-4-k)ix) dx)]\n\nNow, we can integrate each term:\n\nU3(k) = (3/2) * [(1/(4-k)i) * e^((4-k)ix) + (1/(-4-k)i) * e^((-4-k)ix)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier transforms of each term to get the total Fourier transform:\n\nU(k) = U1(k) + U2(k) + U3(k)\n\nThe maximum frequency present in the velocity field can be found by looking at the highest frequency component in the given velocity distribution, which is 4 (from the 3cos(4x) term).\n\nTo find the frequency components that contribute the most to the velocity distribution, we can look at the coefficients of each term in the original velocity distribution:\n\n1. sin(x) has a coefficient of 1\n2. 2sin(2x) has a coefficient of 2\n3. 3cos(4x) has a coefficient of 3\n\nThe frequency components that contribute the most to the velocity distribution are the ones with the highest coefficients, which are the frequencies 2 and 4."
