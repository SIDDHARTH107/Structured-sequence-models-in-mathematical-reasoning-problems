    "message_1": "Consider the two-dimensional heat equation for an image processing problem: \n\n∂u/∂t = k (∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere u is a two-dimensional function representing the image, t is time, k is a constant, and x and y represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the image.\n\nSuppose we want to apply a temperature gradient to a square image with side length 4 units, where the left and right sides of the square are held at a temperature of 1 unit and the top and bottom sides are held at a temperature of 0 units. The initial temperature of the interior of the square is 0.5 units. What is the temperature distribution within the square after 0.1 units of time have elapsed, assuming k = 0.01?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of x, y, and t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = k (X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nNow, we divide both sides by kXYT:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = (X''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y)) / k\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ / k\nX''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we solve the two ordinary differential equations separately:\n\nX''(x) / X(x) = -μ\nY''(y) / Y(y) = -ν\n\nwhere λ = μ + ν. The boundary conditions for X(x) are:\n\nX(0) = X(4) = 0\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A sin(πx/4) + B cos(πx/4)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = B = 0\nX(4) = A sin(π) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be 0 (trivial solution), we have:\n\nμ = (nπ/4)^2, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we solve the Y(y) equation with boundary conditions:\n\nY(0) = Y(4) = 0\n\nThe general solution for Y(y) is:\n\nY(y) = C sin(πy/4) + D cos(πy/4)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nY(0) = D = 0\nY(4) = C sin(π) = 0\n\nSince C cannot be 0 (trivial solution), we have:\n\nν = (mπ/4)^2, m = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we have the general solution for u(x, y, t):\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑[∑(A_nm sin(nπx/4) sin(mπy/4) e^(-kλt))]\n\nwhere λ = μ + ν = (nπ/4)^2 + (mπ/4)^2.\n\nTo find the coefficients A_nm, we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = 0.5:\n\n0.5 = ∑[∑(A_nm sin(nπx/4) sin(mπy/4))]\n\nWe can use Fourier series to find A_nm:\n\nA_nm = (16/π^2) ∫[∫(0.5 sin(nπx/4) sin(mπy/4) dx dy)]\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nA_nm = (16/π^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)(1 - (-1)^m) / (nm)\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution after 0.1 units of time:\n\nu(x, y, 0.1) = ∑[∑((16/π^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)(1 - (-1)^m) / (nm) * sin(nπx/4) sin(mπy/4) * e^(-k((nπ/4)^2 + (mπ/4)^2) * 0.1))]\n\nwhere the summation is taken over n and m, both ranging from 1 to infinity. To get an approximate solution, you can truncate the series after a certain number of terms. The more terms you include, the more accurate the solution will be."
