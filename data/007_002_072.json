    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 728 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 728 is 7 + 2 + 8 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 9, we need to find the remainder when 17 is divided by 9.\n\n17 divided by 9 is 1 with a remainder of 8.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 728 is divided by 9 is 8."
