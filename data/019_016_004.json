    "message_1": "In a class of 40 students, 20 like Physics, 25 like Chemistry, and 12 like both. How many students like neither Physics nor Chemistry?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nThe total number of students who like Physics or Chemistry or both is the sum of the number of students who like Physics and the number of students who like Chemistry, minus the number of students who like both (since we counted them twice).\n\nSo, the number of students who like Physics or Chemistry or both is:\n\n20 (Physics) + 25 (Chemistry) - 12 (Both) = 33 students\n\nNow, we know that there are 40 students in the class. To find out how many students like neither Physics nor Chemistry, we subtract the number of students who like Physics or Chemistry or both from the total number of students:\n\n40 (Total students) - 33 (Physics or Chemistry or both) = 7 students\n\nTherefore, 7 students like neither Physics nor Chemistry."
