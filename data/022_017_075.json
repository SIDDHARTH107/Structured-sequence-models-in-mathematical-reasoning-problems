    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first look for solutions of the form $z(t) = e^{rt}$, where $r$ is a complex number. Substituting this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$(re^{rt})' + e^{rt} = 0$\n\n$r^2 e^{rt} + e^{rt} = 0$\n\nSince $e^{rt}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by $e^{rt}$:\n\n$r^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nSolving for $r$, we find two complex roots:\n\n$r_1 = i$ and $r_2 = -i$\n\nThus, the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\n$z(t) = A e^{it} + B e^{-it}$\n\nNow, we use the initial conditions to find the constants $A$ and $B$. For $z(0) = 1$, we have:\n\n$1 = A e^{0} + B e^{0} = A + B$\n\nFor $z'(0) = i$, we differentiate $z(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$z'(t) = iA e^{it} - iB e^{-it}$\n\nThen, we evaluate $z'(0)$:\n\n$i = iA e^{0} - iB e^{0} = i(A - B)$\n\nDividing both sides by $i$, we get:\n\n$1 = A - B$\n\nSolving the system of equations:\n\n$A + B = 1$\n$A - B = 1$\n\nWe find that $A = 1$ and $B = 0$. Therefore, the solution to the differential equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\n$z(t) = e^{it}$"
