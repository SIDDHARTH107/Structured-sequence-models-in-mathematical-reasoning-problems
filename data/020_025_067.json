The distances between the locations are given in the table below:\n\n| Location | A | B | C | D | E |\n|------|----|----|----|----|----|\n| A   |  0 | 10 | 20 | 25 | 15 |\n| B   | 10 |  0 | 15 | 22 | 18 |\n| C   | 20 | 15 |  0 | 30 | 25 |\n| D   | 25 | 22 | 30 |  0 | 14 |\n| E   | 15 | 18 | 25 | 14 |  0 |\n\nIf the delivery company wants to minimize the total distance traveled while visiting all 5 locations, what is the optimal route they should take?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for all possible permutations of the locations and then selecting the one with the minimum distance. There are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible permutations, but since the starting point doesn't matter, we can divide this by 5, leaving us with 24 unique routes to check.\n\nHere are the 24 unique routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E: 10+15+30+14 = 69\n2. A-B-C-E-D: 10+15+25+14 = 64\n3. A-B-D-C-E: 10+22+30+25 = 87\n4. A-B-D-E-C: 10+22+14+25 = 71\n5. A-B-E-C-D: 10+18+25+30 = 83\n6. A-B-E-D-C: 10+18+14+30 = 72\n\n7. A-C-B-D-E: 20+15+22+14 = 71\n8. A-C-B-E-D: 20+15+18+14 = 67\n9. A-C-D-B-E: 20+30+22+18 = 90\n10. A-C-D-E-B: 20+30+14+18 = 82\n11. A-C-E-B-D: 20+25+18+22 = 85\n12. A-C-E-D-B: 20+25+14+22 = 81\n\n13. A-D-B-C-E: 25+22+15+25 = 87\n14. A-D-B-E-C: 25+22+18+25 = 90\n15. A-D-C-B-E: 25+30+15+18 = 88\n16. A-D-C-E-B: 25+30+25+18 = 98\n17. A-D-E-B-C: 25+14+18+15 = 72\n18. A-D-E-C-B: 25+14+25+15 = 79\n\n19. A-E-B-C-D: 15+18+15+30 = 78\n20. A-E-B-D-C: 15+18+22+30 = 85\n21. A-E-C-B-D: 15+25+15+22 = 77\n22. A-E-C-D-B: 15+25+30+22 = 92\n23. A-E-D-B-C: 15+14+22+15 = 66\n24. A-E-D-C-B: 15+14+30+15 = 74\n\nThe route with the minimum total distance is A-E-D-B-C with a distance of 66 units. So, the optimal route for the delivery company to take is A → E → D → B → C."
