    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 10 (days)\n- k = 3 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.4 (probability of rain each day)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(n, k), which is the number of ways to choose 3 rainy days out of 10 days:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!)\n          = 10! / (3! * 7!)\n          = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n          = 120\n\nNow we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * 0.4^3 * (1-0.4)^(10-3)\n         = 120 * 0.4^3 * 0.6^7\n         = 120 * 0.064 * 0.0279936\n         = 0.21504\n\nSo the probability that it will rain on exactly 3 days out of the next 10 days is approximately 0.215 or 21.5%."
