    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, and so on.\n\nTo find the 8th Mersenne prime, we need to find the first 8 prime values of n for which M_n is also prime. The first 8 prime values of n are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, and 31.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Mersenne primes for these values of n:\n\nM_2 = 2^2 - 1 = 3\nM_3 = 2^3 - 1 = 7\nM_5 = 2^5 - 1 = 31\nM_7 = 2^7 - 1 = 127\nM_13 = 2^13 - 1 = 8191\nM_17 = 2^17 - 1 = 131071\nM_19 = 2^19 - 1 = 524287\nM_31 = 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647\n\nSo, the 8th Mersenne prime number is 2147483647."
