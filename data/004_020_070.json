    "message_1": "A 100 N force is applied to an object moving in a straight line from x=0 to x=10 meters along the x-axis. The force is directed along the line of motion and varies with the position x as F(x) = 10/(x+1) N. Find the work done by the force in moving the object from x=0 to x=10 meters along the x-axis using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force in moving the object from x=0 to x=10 meters along the x-axis, we need to integrate the force function F(x) with respect to x over the given interval [0, 10]. The work done W can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nW = ∫(F(x) dx) from 0 to 10\n\nGiven the force function F(x) = 10/(x+1) N, we have:\n\nW = ∫(10/(x+1) dx) from 0 to 10\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = x + 1, then du = dx. When x = 0, u = 1, and when x = 10, u = 11. Now, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nW = ∫(10/u du) from 1 to 11\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nW = 10 * ∫(1/u du) from 1 to 11\n\nThe integral of 1/u with respect to u is ln|u|, so:\n\nW = 10 * (ln|u|) from 1 to 11\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = 10 * (ln|11| - ln|1|)\n\nSince ln(1) = 0, we have:\n\nW = 10 * ln(11)\n\nW ≈ 23.98 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force in moving the object from x=0 to x=10 meters along the x-axis is approximately 23.98 Joules."
