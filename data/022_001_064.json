    "message_2": "To find the value of f(z) for |z| > 1 using the concept of analytic continuation, we first need to find an alternative representation of f(z) that converges for |z| > 1. \n\nConsider the integral representation of f(z):\n\nf(z) = ∫(0 to 1) (t^n)/(n+1) dt\n\nNow, we can rewrite f(z) using the geometric series formula:\n\nf(z) = ∫(0 to 1) (1 - (1 - t)z)^n dt\n\nThis integral converges for all z in the complex plane. Now, we can use the binomial theorem to expand the integrand:\n\n(1 - (1 - t)z)^n = Summation(k=0 to n) C(n, k) (1 - t)^kz^k\n\nNow, we can interchange the order of summation and integration:\n\nf(z) = Summation(k=0 to infinity) C(n, k) ∫(0 to 1) (1 - t)^kz^k dt\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\n∫(0 to 1) (1 - t)^k dt = [(1 - t)^(k+1) / (k+1)](0 to 1) = 1/(k+1)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf(z) = Summation(k=0 to infinity) C(n, k) z^k / (k+1)\n\nThis representation of f(z) converges for all z in the complex plane, including |z| > 1. Therefore, using the concept of analytic continuation, the value of f(z) for |z| > 1 is given by:\n\nf(z) = Summation(k=0 to infinity) C(n, k) z^k / (k+1)"
