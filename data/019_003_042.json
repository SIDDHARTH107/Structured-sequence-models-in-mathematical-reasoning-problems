    "message_1": "I apologize, but I cannot provide a precise numerical problem for Modal Logic as it is not a branch of mathematics that involves numerical computation. Modal Logic deals with reasoning about necessity and possibility, as well as concepts such as modalities, modal operators, and possible worlds. It is more concerned with the structure of reasoning than with numerical computation. Is there another topic in mathematics that I may assist you with?",
    "message_2": "No problem! Please feel free to provide a problem or topic from another branch of mathematics, such as algebra, calculus, geometry, or statistics, and I would be happy to help you with it."
