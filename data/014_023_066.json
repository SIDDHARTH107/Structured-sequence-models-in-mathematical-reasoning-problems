    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using a rail fence cipher with 3 rails, we write the letters diagonally in a zigzag pattern and then read the rows sequentially. The pattern looks like this:\n\nM   E   A\n A T M T I\n  T   C   S\n\nNow, read the rows sequentially to get the encrypted message: MEAATMTITCS"
