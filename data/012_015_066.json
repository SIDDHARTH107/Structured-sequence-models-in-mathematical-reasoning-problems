    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of edges in a connected undirected graph with 12 vertices and each vertex having a degree of at least 3, we can use the Handshaking Lemma. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nLet V be the number of vertices (12 in this case) and E be the number of edges. Since each vertex has a degree of at least 3, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least 3V. According to the Handshaking Lemma, we have:\n\n2E ≥ 3V\n\nSubstitute V with 12:\n\n2E ≥ 3 * 12\n2E ≥ 36\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum number of edges, we can divide both sides by 2:\n\nE ≥ 18\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges the graph can have is 18."
