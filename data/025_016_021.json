Let $p_1=(1,1)$ and $p_2=(2,4)$ be two points on the curve. Find a birational transformation between $\\mathbb{P}^2$ and another projective plane, such that under this transformation, the curve maps to a non-singular cubic curve with equation $\\tilde{y}^2=\\tilde{x}^3+\\tilde{a}\\tilde{x}+\\tilde{b}$ with $p_1$ and $p_2$ mapping to $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ respectively.",
    "message_2": "To find a birational transformation that maps the points $p_1 = (1,1)$ and $p_2 = (2,4)$ to $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ respectively, we can use the following linear transformation:\n\n$\\tilde{x} = x - 1$\n\n$\\tilde{y} = y - 1$\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the transformed curve in terms of $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$. To do this, we substitute the expressions for $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$ into the original equation:\n\n$(\\tilde{y} + 1)^2 = (\\tilde{x} + 1)^3 + a(\\tilde{x} + 1) + b$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$\\tilde{y}^2 + 2\\tilde{y} + 1 = \\tilde{x}^3 + 3\\tilde{x}^2 + 3\\tilde{x} + 1 + a\\tilde{x} + a + b$\n\n$\\tilde{y}^2 = \\tilde{x}^3 + (a + 3)\\tilde{x}^2 + (3 + a)\\tilde{x} + (a + b)$\n\nNow, we have the transformed curve equation in terms of $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$:\n\n$\\tilde{y}^2 = \\tilde{x}^3 + \\tilde{a}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\tilde{b}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{c}$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{a} = a + 3$, $\\tilde{b} = 3 + a$, and $\\tilde{c} = a + b$.\n\nSince the transformed curve should be non-singular, we need to check the discriminant of the curve. The discriminant of a cubic curve in the form $\\tilde{y}^2 = \\tilde{x}^3 + \\tilde{a}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\tilde{b}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{c}$ is given by:\n\n$\\Delta = -4\\tilde{a}^3\\tilde{c} + \\tilde{a}^2\\tilde{b}^2 - 4\\tilde{b}^3 - 27\\tilde{c}^2$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\tilde{a}$, $\\tilde{b}$, and $\\tilde{c}$, we get:\n\n$\\Delta = -4(a + 3)^3(a + b) + (a + 3)^2(3 + a)^2 - 4(3 + a)^3 - 27(a + b)^2$\n\nSince the original curve is non-singular, its discriminant is non-zero. Therefore, the transformed curve will also be non-singular as long as the transformation is birational.\n\nThus, the birational transformation between the projective planes is given by:\n\n$\\tilde{x} = x - 1$\n\n$\\tilde{y} = y - 1$\n\nand the equation of the transformed curve is:\n\n$\\tilde{y}^2 = \\tilde{x}^3 + \\tilde{a}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\tilde{b}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{c}$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{a} = a + 3$, $\\tilde{b} = 3 + a$, and $\\tilde{c} = a + b$."
