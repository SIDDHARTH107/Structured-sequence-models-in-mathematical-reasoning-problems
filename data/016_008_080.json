    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of a self-similar fractal like the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, N = 4 and S = 3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.26186\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the fourth iteration is approximately 1.26186. Note that the dimension remains the same after each iteration, as the fractal's self-similarity property ensures that the dimension is consistent across all iterations."
