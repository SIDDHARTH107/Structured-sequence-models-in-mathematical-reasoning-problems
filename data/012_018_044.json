    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to remove enough edges so that at least one vertex becomes isolated (i.e., it has no edges connected to it). In the worst-case scenario, we have a complete graph with 8 vertices, which would have C(8,2) = 28 edges. However, our graph G has only 12 edges, so it's not a complete graph.\n\nLet's consider the minimum number of edges required to connect all 8 vertices. This can be achieved by creating a tree structure with 7 edges (since a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges). In this case, removing just one edge would disconnect the graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from the graph G to make it disconnected is 1."
