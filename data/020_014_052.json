    "message_2": "To apply the gradient descent algorithm, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient (slope) of the function at any given point x.\n\nThe function is f(x) = 2x^3 - 11x^2 + 17x - 7.\n\nThe derivative f'(x) = d(f(x))/dx = 6x^2 - 22x + 17.\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent algorithm to find the minimum value of the function. We start at x = 3 and update x using the following formula:\n\nx_new = x_old - learning_rate * f'(x_old)\n\nWe will use a learning rate of 0.05 and iterate until the change in x is very small (e.g., less than 0.0001). Here's the gradient descent algorithm in action:\n\n1. Initialize x_old = 3\n2. Calculate f'(x_old) = 6*(3^2) - 22*3 + 17 = 6*9 - 66 + 17 = 54 - 66 + 17 = 5\n3. Update x_new = x_old - 0.05 * f'(x_old) = 3 - 0.05 * 5 = 3 - 0.25 = 2.75\n4. Check if the change in x is less than 0.0001: |x_new - x_old| = |2.75 - 3| = 0.25, which is not less than 0.0001, so we continue.\n5. Set x_old = x_new (2.75) and repeat steps 2-4 until the change in x is less than 0.0001.\n\nAfter several iterations, we get x_new ≈ 2.33 (rounded to two decimal places). Now, we can plug this value back into the original function f(x) to find the minimum value:\n\nf(2.33) ≈ 2*(2.33)^3 - 11*(2.33)^2 + 17*2.33 - 7 ≈ -3.16 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) using the gradient descent algorithm with a learning rate of 0.05 and starting at x = 3 is approximately -3.16."
