    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of this graph, we can use Vizing's theorem, which states that the chromatic index of a graph is either its maximum degree (Δ) or Δ + 1.\n\nIn this graph, the maximum degree is 3, as there are vertices with 3 edges connected to them. Therefore, the chromatic index is either 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges using 3 colors. We can start by coloring the edges of the triangle formed by the vertices with degree 3. We can use all three colors for these edges. However, when we try to color the remaining edges connected to these vertices, we find that we cannot do so without using the same color for adjacent edges.\n\nFor example, let's say we color the triangle edges with colors A, B, and C. The vertex connected to the edge with color A also has an edge connected to the vertex with color B. We cannot use color A or B for this edge, so we must use color C. However, this creates a conflict as the edge with color C is now adjacent to another edge with color C.\n\nTherefore, we cannot color the graph with 3 colors, and the chromatic index must be 4. So, the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of this graph such that no two adjacent edges have the same color is 4."
