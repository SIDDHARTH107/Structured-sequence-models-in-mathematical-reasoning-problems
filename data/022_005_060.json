    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1) / (z - 2i)^3 at z = 2i, we can use the formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order n:\n\nRes(f(z), z0) = (1/(n-1)!) * (d^(n-1)/dz^(n-1))[(z-z0)^n * f(z)] at z=z0\n\nIn this case, the pole is at z0 = 2i and has an order of n = 3. So, we need to find the second derivative of (z - 2i)^3 * f(z) and evaluate it at z = 2i.\n\nFirst, let's find (z - 2i)^3 * f(z):\n\n(z - 2i)^3 * f(z) = (z - 2i)^3 * (z^2 + 1) / (z - 2i)^3 = z^2 + 1\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of z^2 + 1 with respect to z:\n\nd^2(z^2 + 1)/dz^2 = d/dz(2z) = 2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the second derivative at z = 2i:\n\n2(2i) = 4i\n\nFinally, we can use the residue formula:\n\nRes(f(z), 2i) = (1/(3-1)!) * 4i = (1/2!) * 4i = 2i\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1) / (z - 2i)^3 at z = 2i is 2i."
