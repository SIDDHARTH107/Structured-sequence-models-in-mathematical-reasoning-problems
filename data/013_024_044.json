    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the math student to solve:\n\nIn a group of volunteers, each member can choose to either donate $5 or refrain from donating. If at least half of the group donates, the entire group will receive a prize of $50. Otherwise, the prize will not be awarded. Assume that there are seven volunteers in the group. What is the probability that the group will receive the prize if each member independently decides whether to donate or not?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of probability and combinations. Since each volunteer can either donate or not donate, there are 2 choices for each volunteer. Therefore, there are 2^7 = 128 possible outcomes for the group.\n\nFor the group to receive the prize, at least half of the members need to donate. In a group of 7, this means at least 4 members need to donate. We will calculate the probability for each case where 4, 5, 6, or 7 members donate.\n\n1. 4 members donate: There are C(7,4) = 35 ways to choose 4 donors out of 7.\n2. 5 members donate: There are C(7,5) = 21 ways to choose 5 donors out of 7.\n3. 6 members donate: There are C(7,6) = 7 ways to choose 6 donors out of 7.\n4. All 7 members donate: There is only 1 way for all members to donate.\n\nNow, we will add up all the successful outcomes: 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.\n\nFinally, we will calculate the probability of the group receiving the prize by dividing the successful outcomes by the total possible outcomes: 64/128 = 1/2 or 50%.\n\nSo, the probability that the group will receive the prize if each member independently decides whether to donate or not is 50%."
