The time taken by each truck to travel to each location is given in the table below:\n\n|               | Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 | Location 4 | Location 5 | Location 6 |\n|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| **Truck 1**   | 7          | 3          | 4          | 5          | 8          | 9          |\n| **Truck 2**   | 2          | 6          | 5          | 8          | 5          | 5          |\n| **Truck 3**   | 6          | 6          | 7          | 3          | 7          | 3          |\n| **Truck 4**   | 5          | 5          | 8          | 5          | 5          | 5          |\n| **Truck 5**   | 6          | 6          | 1          | 7          | 4          | 6          |\n\nWhat is the minimum total time it will take for all five trucks to make their deliveries?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum total time, we need to assign each truck to a location in such a way that the total time taken is minimized. We can do this by trying different combinations and finding the one with the lowest total time.\n\nOne possible combination with the minimum total time is:\n- Truck 1 goes to Location 2 (3 minutes)\n- Truck 2 goes to Location 1 (2 minutes)\n- Truck 3 goes to Location 4 (3 minutes)\n- Truck 4 goes to Location 6 (5 minutes)\n- Truck 5 goes to Location 3 (1 minute)\n\nIn this combination, Location 5 is not visited, but since only 5 trucks are available, one location will always be left unvisited.\n\nThe total time taken for this combination is 3 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 14 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total time it will take for all five trucks to make their deliveries is 14 minutes."
