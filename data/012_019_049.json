    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In this case, the graph can be colored using 3 colors.\n\nHere's one possible edge coloring:\n\n```\n1-2-1-2-1\n| |   | |\n3-1-3-1-3\n```\n\nSo, the chromatic index of the given graph is 3."
