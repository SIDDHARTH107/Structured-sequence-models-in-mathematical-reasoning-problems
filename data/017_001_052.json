    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C4 (cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (Klein four-group), we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the properties of its elements.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic properties of groups:\n\n1. The identity element e is unique and has the property that for any element x in G, x * e = e * x = x.\n2. Each element in G has a unique inverse, i.e., for any x in G, there exists an element x^(-1) in G such that x * x^(-1) = x^(-1) * x = e.\n3. The group operation is associative, i.e., for any elements x, y, z in G, (x * y) * z = x * (y * z).\n\nNow let's analyze the possible structures of G:\n\nCase 1: One of the elements has order 4.\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume that the order of element a is 4. Then, a^4 = e, and a, a^2, a^3, and a^4 = e are distinct elements in G. In this case, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, and G is a cyclic group of order 4, i.e., G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: None of the elements have order 4.\nIn this case, the order of each non-identity element must be 2, since the order of an element must divide the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem). Let's analyze the possible products of the elements:\n\n1. a * a = e, b * b = e, and c * c = e, since all non-identity elements have order 2.\n2. a * b cannot be equal to a or b, since otherwise, a * b * b = a or b * a * a = b, which would imply that a or b has order 1 or 4, which is a contradiction. Therefore, a * b must be equal to c or e. If a * b = e, then b = a^(-1), which contradicts the fact that a has order 2. So, a * b = c.\n3. Similarly, b * c cannot be equal to b or c, and b * c = a or e. If b * c = e, then c = b^(-1), which contradicts the fact that b has order 2. So, b * c = a.\n4. Finally, c * a cannot be equal to c or a, and c * a = b or e. If c * a = e, then a = c^(-1), which contradicts the fact that c has order 2. So, c * a = b.\n\nNow we have the following group operation table for G:\n\n```\n  * | e  a  b  c\n----|---------\n  e | e  a  b  c\n  a | a  e  c  b\n  b | b  c  e  a\n  c | c  b  a  e\n```\n\nThis group operation table corresponds to the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, in this case, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C4 or V4."
