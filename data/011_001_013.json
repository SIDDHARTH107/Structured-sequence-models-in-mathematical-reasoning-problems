    "message_2": "To choose 4 people out of 10 friends, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (10) and k is the number of people we want to choose (4).\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo there are 210 different ways to choose 4 people out of 10 friends to form a music band."
