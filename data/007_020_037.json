Compute the totient function, φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1).\n   φ(323) = (17-1) * (19-1) = 16 * 18 = 288\n\n3. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1 (e and φ(n) are coprime). Let's choose e = 5.\n\n4. Compute the modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod φ(n)), which will be the private key d.\n   d ≡ e^(-1) (mod φ(n))\n   d ≡ 5^(-1) (mod 288)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular inverse of 5 (mod 288):\n\n   5 * d ≡ 1 (mod 288)\n   5 * d = 1 + 288 * k (for some integer k)\n\nBy trial and error or using an algorithm, we find that d = 173 satisfies the equation:\n\n   5 * 173 = 865 = 1 + 288 * 3\n\nSo, the public key is (n, e) = (323, 5), and the private key is (n, d) = (323, 173).\n\nNow, let's encrypt the message \"5\" using the public key:\n\n   ciphertext ≡ plaintext^e (mod n)\n   ciphertext ≡ 5^5 (mod 323)\n   ciphertext ≡ 3125 (mod 323)\n   ciphertext = 106\n\nThe encrypted message is \"106\". To decrypt the message using the private key:\n\n   plaintext ≡ ciphertext^d (mod n)\n   plaintext ≡ 106^173 (mod 323)\n   plaintext = 5\n\nThe decrypted message is \"5\", which is the original message."
