    "message_2": "We can apply the Maximum Modulus Principle to solve this problem. The Maximum Modulus Principle states that if a function is analytic in a closed and bounded domain, then the maximum value of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nIn this case, the function f(z) is analytic in the closed unit disc $\\overline{D}$, and we are given that |f(z)| <= 5 for all z in $\\overline{D}$. The boundary of the unit disc is the circle with radius 1, i.e., the set of complex numbers z with |z| = 1.\n\nSince the maximum value of |f(z)| is attained on the boundary, we have:\n\nmax{|f(0)|} <= max{|f(z)| : |z| = 1} <= 5\n\nNow, we need to show that there exists a function f(z) that satisfies the given conditions and has |f(0)| = 5. Consider the constant function f(z) = 5. This function is analytic in the closed unit disc, and |f(z)| = 5 for all z in $\\overline{D}$. Moreover, |f(0)| = 5.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value that |f(0)| can attain is 5."
