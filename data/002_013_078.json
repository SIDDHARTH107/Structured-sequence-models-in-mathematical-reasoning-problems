    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 6 meters, a width of 4 meters, and a height of 3 meters. Find its volume.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nIn this case, the length is 6 meters, the width is 4 meters, and the height is 3 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 * 4 * 3\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 72\n\nVolume = 24 cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 24 cubic meters."
