    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0.\n\n0 = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6\n\nWe can try to factor the polynomial to find the roots. Since it's a cubic polynomial, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nLet's test these possible roots:\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0\nSo, x = 1 is a root.\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n1 |  1  -6  11  -6\n  |     1  -5   6\n  ----------------\n      1  -5   6  0\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is x^2 - 5x + 6. Now, we can factor this quadratic:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as:\n\nf(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSetting each factor to zero, we find the x-intercepts:\n\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nThus, the x-intercepts are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3."
