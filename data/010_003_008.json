    "message_2": "To determine if X and Y are topologically equivalent, we need to find a homeomorphism between them. A homeomorphism is a bijective function f: X → Y such that both f and its inverse f^(-1) are continuous.\n\nLet's analyze the given topologies τ and σ:\n\nτ = {{∅}, {1}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}\nσ = {{∅}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}\n\nWe can try to define a function f: X → Y as follows:\n\nf(1) = 1\nf(2) = 2\nf(3) = 3\nf(4) = 1\n\nThis function is not a bijection since f(1) = f(4) = 1, so it cannot be a homeomorphism.\n\nNow let's try another function g: X → Y as follows:\n\ng(1) = 1\ng(2) = 2\ng(3) = 3\ng(4) = 3\n\nThis function is also not a bijection since g(3) = g(4) = 3, so it cannot be a homeomorphism either.\n\nSince we cannot find a homeomorphism between X and Y, we can conclude that X and Y are not topologically equivalent."
