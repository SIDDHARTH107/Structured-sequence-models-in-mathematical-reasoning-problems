    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation numerically using the finite element method, we will first discretize the spatial domain and then apply the method of lines to discretize the time domain. \n\n1. Discretize the spatial domain:\nDivide the domain [0, π] into n = 10 intervals, with each interval having a length of Δx = π/10. Let x_i = iΔx for i = 0, 1, ..., 10.\n\n2. Discretize the time domain:\nChoose a time step of Δt = 0.01. Let t_j = jΔt for j = 0, 1, ..., until the desired time is reached.\n\n3. Apply the method of lines:\nApproximate the second derivative u_xx(x, t) using the central difference formula:\n\nu_xx(x_i, t_j) ≈ (u(x_(i-1), t_j) - 2u(x_i, t_j) + u(x_(i+1), t_j)) / (Δx)^2\n\nSubstitute this approximation into the PDE:\n\nu_t(x_i, t_j) - 4(u(x_(i-1), t_j) - 2u(x_i, t_j) + u(x_(i+1), t_j)) / (Δx)^2 = -5cos(3πx_i)e^(-t_j)\n\n4. Solve the resulting system of ODEs:\nUse an ODE solver (e.g., the forward Euler method) to solve the system of ODEs for u(x_i, t_j) at each time step.\n\n5. Plot the numerical solution:\nPlot the numerical solution u(x_i, t_j) at t = 0.1 and t = 1.0.\n\nThe actual implementation of this method would require programming and the use of a numerical library to solve the system of ODEs. Since I am an AI language model, I cannot directly execute code or produce plots. However, I can provide you with a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to implement the finite element method for this problem using the NumPy library:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Parameters\nn = 10\ndx = np.pi / n\ndt = 0.01\nt_end = 1.0\nx = np.linspace(0, np.pi, n+1)\ntimesteps = int(t_end / dt)\n\n# Initial condition\nu = np.zeros((n+1, timesteps+1))\nu[:, 0] = 2 * np.sin(2 * x)\n\n# Time-stepping loop\nfor j in range(timesteps):\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        u_xx = (u[i-1, j] - 2*u[i, j] + u[i+1, j]) / dx**2\n        u_t = -5 * np.cos(3*np.pi*x[i]) * np.exp(-j*dt) + 4 * u_xx\n        u[i, j+1] = u[i, j] + dt * u_t\n\n# Plot the numerical solution\nplt.plot(x, u[:, int(0.1/dt)], label='t = 0.1')\nplt.plot(x, u[:, -1], label='t = 1.0')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('u(x, t)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code snippet sets up the problem, solves it using the finite element method, and plots the numerical solution at t = 0.1 and t = 1.0. Note that this implementation uses the forward Euler method for time-stepping, which may not be the most accurate or stable choice for this problem. You may need to experiment with different time-stepping methods or adjust the time step size to obtain a more accurate solution."
