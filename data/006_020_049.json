    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, residents owning pets) out of n trials (in this case, 50 residents)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 50)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 25)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 25 residents owning pets, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 25 to k = 50.\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 25 to 50\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.6)^k * (0.4)^(50-k)] for k = 25 to 50\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) ≈ 0.9824\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 of the 50 randomly selected residents own pets is approximately 98.24%."
