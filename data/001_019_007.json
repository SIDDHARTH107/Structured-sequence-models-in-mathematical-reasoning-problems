    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x - 2| = 10, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero, i.e., 3x - 2 â‰¥ 0.\nIn this case, we can remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n\n3x - 2 = 10\n3x = 12\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative, i.e., 3x - 2 < 0.\nIn this case, we can remove the absolute value sign by multiplying the expression by -1 and solve the equation:\n\n-(3x - 2) = 10\n-3x + 2 = 10\n-3x = 8\nx = -8/3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 4 and -8/3."
