    "message_1": "A candy company is testing two new types of gummy bears, flavor A and flavor B. To test which flavor is more popular, they randomly select 100 people and give them each one of the two flavors. Out of the 100 people, 60 preferred flavor A and 40 preferred flavor B. Determine the sample proportion and sample percentage of people who preferred flavor A.",
    "message_2": "To determine the sample proportion of people who preferred flavor A, we need to divide the number of people who preferred flavor A by the total number of people in the sample.\n\nSample proportion = (Number of people who preferred flavor A) / (Total number of people in the sample)\n\nSample proportion = 60 / 100\n\nSample proportion = 0.6\n\nTo determine the sample percentage of people who preferred flavor A, we need to multiply the sample proportion by 100.\n\nSample percentage = Sample proportion × 100\n\nSample percentage = 0.6 × 100\n\nSample percentage = 60%\n\nSo, the sample proportion of people who preferred flavor A is 0.6, and the sample percentage is 60%."
