    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player A has $100 to split between herself and Player B. Player A can choose to keep any amount she wants and give the remainder to Player B. Determine the Nash equilibrium solution for this game.",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, there is only one player making a decision, which is Player A. Player B has no strategic choices to make, as they can only accept whatever amount Player A decides to give them. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium in this game is determined solely by Player A's choice.\n\nSince Player A is trying to maximize her own payoff, the Nash equilibrium solution would be for Player A to keep the entire $100 for herself and give $0 to Player B. This is because any other allocation would result in a lower payoff for Player A, and there is no incentive for her to change her strategy."
