    "message_2": "To find the length of sides AC and BC, we can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the lengths of sides BC, AC, and AB respectively, and A, B, and C are the measures of angles A, B, and C respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the measure of angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\nC = 180 - (A + B) = 180 - (38 + 65) = 180 - 103 = 77 degrees\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the lengths of sides AC (b) and BC (a). We have:\n\na / sin(A) = c / sin(C)\nb / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe know the length of side AB (c) is 12.5 cm, so we can plug that into the equations:\n\na / sin(38) = 12.5 / sin(77)\nb / sin(65) = 12.5 / sin(77)\n\nNow we can solve for a and b:\n\na = (12.5 / sin(77)) * sin(38)\nb = (12.5 / sin(77)) * sin(65)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values and perform the calculations:\n\na ≈ (12.5 / 0.974) * 0.615 ≈ 7.88 cm\nb ≈ (12.5 / 0.974) * 0.898 ≈ 11.52 cm\n\nSo, the length of side AC (b) is approximately 11.52 cm, and the length of side BC (a) is approximately 7.88 cm."
