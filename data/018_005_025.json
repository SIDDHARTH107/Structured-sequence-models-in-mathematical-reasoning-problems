    "message_2": "In set theory, the complement of a set A, denoted by B or A', is the set of all elements that are not in A. The intersection of A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nSince B is the complement of A, it contains all elements that are not in A. Therefore, there are no common elements between A and B.\n\nHence, the intersection of A and B is an empty set, denoted by ∅ or {}."
