    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of sections H⁰(C,L) of the line bundle L, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a curve C of genus g, we have:\n\nh⁰(C,L) - h¹(C,L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nwhere h⁰(C,L) is the dimension of the space of sections H⁰(C,L), h¹(C,L) is the dimension of the space of sections H¹(C,L), and deg(L) is the degree of the line bundle L.\n\nIn our case, we have a complex projective curve C of degree 3, which means that it is a smooth cubic curve. The genus g of a smooth cubic curve is given by the formula:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In our case, d = 3, so the genus g is:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 2(1)/2 = 1\n\nNow, we are given that the degree of the line bundle L is 2. Therefore, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh⁰(C,L) - h¹(C,L) = deg(L) + 1 - g = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2\n\nTo find h⁰(C,L), we need to determine h¹(C,L). By Serre duality, we have:\n\nh¹(C,L) = h⁰(C, K_C ⊗ L^(-1))\n\nwhere K_C is the canonical bundle on C. For a smooth cubic curve, the canonical bundle is isomorphic to the line bundle of degree 3:\n\nK_C ≅ O_C(3)\n\nThus, we have:\n\nh¹(C,L) = h⁰(C, O_C(3) ⊗ L^(-1))\n\nSince the degree of L is 2, the degree of L^(-1) is -2, and the degree of O_C(3) ⊗ L^(-1) is 1. Now, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem again:\n\nh⁰(C, O_C(3) ⊗ L^(-1)) - h¹(C, O_C(3) ⊗ L^(-1)) = deg(O_C(3) ⊗ L^(-1)) + 1 - g = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\n\nSince h¹(C, O_C(3) ⊗ L^(-1)) is non-negative, we have:\n\nh⁰(C, O_C(3) ⊗ L^(-1)) ≥ 1\n\nThus, h¹(C,L) = h⁰(C, O_C(3) ⊗ L^(-1)) ≥ 1.\n\nNow, we can find h⁰(C,L) using the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh⁰(C,L) - h¹(C,L) = 2\n\nSince h¹(C,L) ≥ 1, we have:\n\nh⁰(C,L) ≥ 3\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the exact value of h⁰(C,L) without more information about the specific line bundle L. So, the dimension of the space of sections H⁰(C,L) is at least 3."
