    "message_2": "To estimate the standard error of the sample mean income using the bootstrapping technique, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw 1000 random samples with replacement from the original sample of 50 adults.\n2. Calculate the mean income for each of the 1000 samples.\n3. Calculate the standard deviation of the 1000 sample means.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data, we can't perform the bootstrapping directly. However, we can provide an approximation of the standard error using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\nAccording to the CLT, the standard error of the sample mean can be estimated as:\n\nStandard Error (SE) = Sample Standard Deviation / sqrt(Sample Size)\n\nIn this case, the sample standard deviation is $1000, and the sample size is 50. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nSE = 1000 / sqrt(50)\nSE ≈ 1000 / 7.071\nSE ≈ 141.42\n\nSo, the estimated standard error of the sample mean income using the bootstrapping technique would be approximately $141.42."
