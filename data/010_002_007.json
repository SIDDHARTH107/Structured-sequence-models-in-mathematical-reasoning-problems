    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, every subset of X is an open set. For a sequence to converge in a topological space, it must satisfy the following condition:\n\nFor every open neighborhood U of the limit point x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, x_n ∈ U.\n\nHowever, in the discrete topology, every singleton set {x} is an open set. Therefore, for any point x in X, we can choose an open neighborhood U = {x}.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence (x_n) in X defined by x_n = n for all n ∈ N. For this sequence to converge, there must exist a limit point x ∈ X such that the condition mentioned above is satisfied.\n\nHowever, for any x ∈ X, we can choose an open neighborhood U = {x}. Since x_n = n, there is no natural number N such that for all n > N, x_n ∈ U, because x_n will always be different from x for any n ≠ x.\n\nTherefore, the sequence (x_n) in X defined by x_n = n for all n ∈ N does not converge in the discrete topology."
