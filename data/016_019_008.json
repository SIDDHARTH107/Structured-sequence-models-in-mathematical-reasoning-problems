    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the Koch curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of the previous length.\n\nLet's denote the number of iterations as n and the length of each side of the initial equilateral triangle as L. The perimeter of the Koch island after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the number of segments in the Koch curve is 4^4 = 256, and the length of each segment is (1/3)^4 = 1/81.\n\nSince there are 3 sides in the equilateral triangle, the total number of segments in the Koch island is 3 * 256 = 768.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the Koch island after 4 iterations is:\n\nPerimeter = 768 * (1/81) * L\nPerimeter = 768 * (1/81) * 3\nPerimeter = 768 * 3 / 81\nPerimeter = 2304 / 81\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 28.4444 units"
