    "message_1": "Suppose that you have a plain text \"10100110\" that needs to be encrypted using a Feistel cipher structure. The key for the encryption is \"01001011\". If the Feistel cipher structure uses 2 rounds of encryption, and each round involves substituting the values using S-boxes, then what will be the encrypted text?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the specific S-boxes used in the Feistel cipher. S-boxes are substitution tables that determine how the input bits are transformed during each round of encryption. Without knowing the specific S-boxes used, we cannot determine the encrypted text.\n\nHowever, I can explain the general process of a Feistel cipher with 2 rounds:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext into two equal parts, the left half (L0) and the right half (R0). In this case, L0 = \"1010\" and R0 = \"0110\".\n2. Perform the first round of encryption:\n   a. Apply the round function to R0 and the key. This involves substituting the values using the given S-boxes.\n   b. XOR the result of the round function with L0 to get the new left half (L1).\n   c. The new right half (R1) is the original R0.\n3. Perform the second round of encryption:\n   a. Apply the round function to R1 and the key. This involves substituting the values using the given S-boxes.\n   b. XOR the result of the round function with L1 to get the new left half (L2).\n   c. The new right half (R2) is the original R1.\n4. Combine L2 and R2 to get the encrypted text.\n\nOnce you have the specific S-boxes, you can follow these steps to find the encrypted text."
