    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G.\n\n1. Choose an edge e in G. Let's choose the edge (1,2).\n2. Compute the chromatic polynomial of the graph G-e, which is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e. In this case, G-e has edges {(1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)}.\n3. Compute the chromatic polynomial of the graph G/e, which is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e. In this case, G/e has vertices {1,2,3,4,5} and edges {(1,3), (1,4), (3,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)}.\n4. Compute P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k).\n\nNow, we need to find the chromatic polynomials of G-e and G/e.\n\nFor G-e, we can see that it is a bipartite graph with two sets of vertices {1,4} and {2,3,5,6}. The chromatic polynomial of a bipartite graph is k(k-1)^{n-1}, where n is the number of vertices in the larger set. In this case, n = 4, so P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^3.\n\nFor G/e, we can see that it is a 5-cycle with an additional vertex connected to two vertices of the cycle. Let's call this additional vertex 6. We can compute the chromatic polynomial of G/e by considering the cases when vertex 6 has the same color as vertex 1 and when it has a different color.\n\n- If vertex 6 has the same color as vertex 1, then vertex 5 must have a different color, and we have a 4-cycle with vertices {1,3,4,5}. The chromatic polynomial of a 4-cycle is (k-1)(k-2)^2.\n- If vertex 6 has a different color than vertex 1, then we have a 5-cycle with vertices {1,3,4,5,6}. The chromatic polynomial of a 5-cycle is (k-1)(k-2)(k^2-3k+3).\n\nSo, P(G/e, k) = (k-1)(k-2)^2 + (k-1)(k-2)(k^2-3k+3).\n\nFinally, we compute the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)^3 - [(k-1)(k-2)^2 + (k-1)(k-2)(k^2-3k+3)]\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^3 - (k-1)(k-2)[(k-2) + (k^2-3k+3)]\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^3 - (k-1)(k-2)(k^2-2k+1)\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^3 - (k-1)(k-2)(k-1)^2\n\nP(G, k) = (k-1)[k(k-1)^2 - (k-2)(k-1)^2]\n\nP(G, k) = (k-1)(k-1)^2(k-(k-2))\n\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^3(k-2)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the graph G is P(G, k) = (k-1)^3(k-2)."
