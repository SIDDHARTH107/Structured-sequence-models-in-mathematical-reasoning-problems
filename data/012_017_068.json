    "message_2": "To determine if there exists a perfect matching in graph G, we can use Tutte's theorem. Tutte's theorem states that a graph has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of its vertices, the number of connected components with an odd number of vertices in the subgraph induced by the vertices not in U is less than or equal to the number of vertices in U.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 6 vertices and 9 edges. Since there are 6 vertices, we need to find a perfect matching that consists of 3 disjoint edges that cover all the vertices.\n\nLet's analyze the possible cases for the subsets U:\n\n1. If U is empty, then the subgraph induced by the vertices not in U is the entire graph G. Since G has 6 vertices, which is an even number, this condition is satisfied.\n\n2. If U has 1 vertex, then the subgraph induced by the vertices not in U has 5 vertices. In the worst-case scenario, all 5 vertices form a connected component with an odd number of vertices. However, since there is only 1 vertex in U, this condition is also satisfied.\n\n3. If U has 2 vertices, then the subgraph induced by the vertices not in U has 4 vertices. In this case, it is impossible to have more than 2 connected components with an odd number of vertices, so this condition is satisfied as well.\n\n4. If U has 3 or more vertices, then the subgraph induced by the vertices not in U has 3 or fewer vertices. In this case, it is impossible to have more connected components with an odd number of vertices than the number of vertices in U, so this condition is satisfied as well.\n\nSince all the conditions of Tutte's theorem are satisfied, there exists a perfect matching in graph G."
