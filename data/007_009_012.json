    "message_2": "Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nSince 83 is a prime number, all the integers from 1 to 82 are relatively prime to 83. Therefore, the value of Euler's totient function φ(83) is 82."
