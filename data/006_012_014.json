    "message_2": "To find the expected number of houses that will be burglarized, we can multiply the probability of a burglary happening by the total number of houses in the neighborhood.\n\nExpected number of houses burglarized = Probability of burglary * Total number of houses\nExpected number of houses burglarized = 0.25 * 40\nExpected number of houses burglarized = 10\n\nSo, the expected number of houses that will be burglarized in this neighborhood is 10."
