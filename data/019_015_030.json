    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct types that can be formed by the given collection of objects, we can use the formula for the number of combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of objects and k is the number of objects chosen at a time.\n\nIn this case, we have 3 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 1 green ball, for a total of 6 objects. We want to find the number of distinct types that can be formed by choosing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 objects at a time.\n\nC(6, 0) = 1 (empty set)\nC(6, 1) = 6! / (1!(6-1)!) = 6 (1 red, 1 blue, or 1 green)\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15 (2 red, 2 blue, 1 red and 1 blue, 1 red and 1 green, or 1 blue and 1 green)\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20 (3 red, 1 red and 2 blue, 2 red and 1 blue, 1 red and 1 blue and 1 green)\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4!(6-4)!) = 15 (2 red and 2 blue, 3 red and 1 green, 1 red and 2 blue and 1 green)\nC(6, 5) = 6! / (5!(6-5)!) = 6 (3 red and 2 blue, 2 red and 2 blue and 1 green)\nC(6, 6) = 6! / (6!(6-6)!) = 1 (3 red, 2 blue, and 1 green)\n\nNow, we add up all the combinations:\n\n1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\n\nThere are 64 distinct types that can be formed by the given collection of objects."
