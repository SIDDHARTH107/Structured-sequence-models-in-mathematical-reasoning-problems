    "message_2": "To find the minimum size of the vertex cover of G, we need to find the smallest set of vertices that cover all the edges in the graph. In other words, each edge in the graph must be incident to at least one vertex in the vertex cover.\n\nOne possible approach to find the minimum vertex cover is to use the greedy algorithm. We can start by selecting the vertex with the highest degree (the most connected vertex) and remove all the edges connected to that vertex. We repeat this process until there are no more edges left in the graph.\n\n1. Vertex 4 has the highest degree (4 edges connected to it). Select vertex 4 and remove edges {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, and {4, 6}.\n2. Now, vertex 2 and vertex 5 have the highest degree (2 edges connected to each). Select vertex 2 and remove edges {1, 2} and {2, 5}.\n3. Finally, vertex 1 and vertex 6 have the highest degree (1 edge connected to each). Select vertex 1 and remove edge {1, 3}.\n\nNow, all edges have been covered, and the minimum vertex cover is {1, 2, 4} with a size of 3."
