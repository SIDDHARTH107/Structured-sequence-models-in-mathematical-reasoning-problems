    "message_2": "We can use the Poisson probability formula to solve this problem. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, defects) occurring in a fixed interval (in this case, a batch of 1000 circuit boards) when the average rate of events is known (in this case, 3 defects per batch).\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defects in a batch\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average rate of defects per batch (3 in this case)\n- x is the number of defects we want to find the probability for (4 in this case)\n- x! is the factorial of x (the product of all positive integers up to x)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(4) = (e^(-3) * 3^4) / 4!\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(4) = (0.049787 * 81) / 24\n\nP(4) ≈ 0.168031\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 4 defective circuit boards in a batch is approximately 0.168 or 16.8%."
