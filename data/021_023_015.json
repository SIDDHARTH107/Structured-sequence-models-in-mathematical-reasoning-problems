    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex problems. In this case, we will use the GWO algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x - 8 within the range of -5 ≤ x ≤ 5.\n\nTo implement the GWO algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the grey wolf population and parameters (alpha, beta, delta, and omega).\n2. Calculate the fitness of each wolf in the population.\n3. Update the alpha, beta, and delta wolves based on the best fitness values.\n4. Update the position of each wolf in the population using the hunting behavior equations.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nHere's a simplified Python implementation of the GWO algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef objective_function(x):\n    return 2 * x**3 - 3 * x**2 + 6 * x - 8\n\ndef gwo_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations, search_space):\n    # Initialize the grey wolf population and parameters\n    population = np.random.uniform(search_space[0], search_space[1], population_size)\n    alpha, beta, delta = None, None, None\n    alpha_fitness, beta_fitness, delta_fitness = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf')\n\n    for iteration in range(max_iterations):\n        # Calculate the fitness of each wolf in the population\n        for wolf in population:\n            fitness = objective_function(wolf)\n\n            # Update the alpha, beta, and delta wolves based on the best fitness values\n            if fitness < alpha_fitness:\n                delta_fitness = beta_fitness\n                delta = beta\n                beta_fitness = alpha_fitness\n                beta = alpha\n                alpha_fitness = fitness\n                alpha = wolf\n            elif fitness < beta_fitness:\n                delta_fitness = beta_fitness\n                delta = beta\n                beta_fitness = fitness\n                beta = wolf\n            elif fitness < delta_fitness:\n                delta_fitness = fitness\n                delta = wolf\n\n        # Update the position of each wolf in the population using the hunting behavior equations\n        a = 2 - iteration * (2 / max_iterations)\n        for i, wolf in enumerate(population):\n            A1 = 2 * a * np.random.random() - a\n            C1 = 2 * np.random.random()\n            D_alpha = abs(C1 * alpha - wolf)\n            X1 = alpha - A1 * D_alpha\n\n            A2 = 2 * a * np.random.random() - a\n            C2 = 2 * np.random.random()\n            D_beta = abs(C2 * beta - wolf)\n            X2 = beta - A2 * D_beta\n\n            A3 = 2 * a * np.random.random() - a\n            C3 = 2 * np.random.random()\n            D_delta = abs(C3 * delta - wolf)\n            X3 = delta - A3 * D_delta\n\n            population[i] = (X1 + X2 + X3) / 3\n\n    return alpha_fitness, alpha\n\npopulation_size = 50\nmax_iterations = 100\nsearch_space = (-5, 5)\nmin_value, min_x = gwo_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations, search_space)\n\nprint(f\"Minimum value of the function: {min_value}\")\nprint(f\"Value of x: {min_x}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum value of the function and the corresponding x value. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. You can increase the population size and the maximum number of iterations to improve the accuracy of the solution."
