    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches the cube at the center of each face. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nIn this case, the diameter of the sphere is 4 centimeters. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius (r) of the sphere is 4/2 = 2 centimeters.\n\nThe formula for the volume (V) of a sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nSubstitute the value of r into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(2)^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(8)\n\nV = (32/3)π\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately (32/3)π cubic centimeters, or approximately 33.51 cubic centimeters."
