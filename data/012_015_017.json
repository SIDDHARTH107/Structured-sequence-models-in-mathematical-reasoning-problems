    "message_1": "Consider a graph G that contains 10 vertices and 12 edges. Determine whether the graph G is connected or not. If it is not connected, find the number of connected components in the graph.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 10, so a connected graph must have at least 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\nSince G has 12 edges, which is more than the minimum required for a connected graph, it is possible that G is connected. However, we cannot conclude this for certain without more information about the specific connections between vertices.\n\nIf G is not connected, we can determine the number of connected components by using the inequality:\n\nnumber of edges ≤ (number of connected components) * (number of vertices in connected components - 1)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n12 ≤ k * (10 - 1)\n\n12 ≤ 9k\n\nk ≥ 12/9\n\nk ≥ 4/3\n\nSince k must be an integer, the smallest possible value for k is 2. Therefore, if G is not connected, it must have at least 2 connected components."
