    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 players in a beauty contest game, where each player has to choose a number between 0 and 100 inclusive. The winner is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the chosen numbers. What number should a rational player choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. \n\n1. Suppose all players choose the maximum number, which is 100. In this case, the average of all chosen numbers is 100, and 2/3 of the average is 200/3 â‰ˆ 66.67. Therefore, no player would choose a number greater than 66.67, as it would never be the winning number.\n\n2. Now, let's assume all players are rational and know that no one will choose a number greater than 66.67. In this case, the maximum possible average is 66.67, and 2/3 of this average is 44.44. So, no rational player would choose a number greater than 44.44.\n\n3. Continuing this process, we find that the maximum possible average keeps decreasing, and so does the 2/3 of the average. This process converges to 0 as the number of iterations approaches infinity.\n\nSo, a rational player should choose 0 to maximize their chances of winning in this beauty contest game."
