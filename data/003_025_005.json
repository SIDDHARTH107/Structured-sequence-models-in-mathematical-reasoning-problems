    "message_1": "A small boat is sailing on a lake with a velocity of 12 m/s due east. There is a wind blowing toward the north at a velocity of 5 m/s. Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the boat relative to the water.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the boat relative to the water, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and the tangent function to find the magnitude and angle of the vector sum of the boat's velocity and the wind's velocity.\n\nLet Vb represent the velocity of the boat (12 m/s due east) and Vw represent the velocity of the wind (5 m/s due north). The resultant velocity, Vr, can be found by adding these two vectors.\n\nFirst, we find the magnitude of the resultant velocity:\n\nVr = √(Vb^2 + Vw^2)\nVr = √(12^2 + 5^2)\nVr = √(144 + 25)\nVr = √169\nVr = 13 m/s\n\nNow, we find the direction of the resultant velocity using the tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(θ) = Vw/Vb\ntan(θ) = 5/12\n\nθ = arctan(5/12)\nθ ≈ 22.6°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant velocity of the boat relative to the water is 13 m/s, and the direction is approximately 22.6° north of east."
