The results are provided below:\n\nScale A: 120, 130, 100, 110, 125, 135, 90, 130, 140, 115\nScale B: 600, 650, 500, 550, 625, 675, 450, 650, 700, 575\n\nUse the interquartile range (IQR) to determine which scale is more robust in terms of measuring the weights of apples.",
    "message_2": "To determine which scale is more robust in terms of measuring the weights of apples, we need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR) for both sets of data. The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), which helps us understand the spread of the data.\n\nFirst, let's arrange the data in ascending order:\n\nScale A: 90, 100, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 130, 135, 140\nScale B: 450, 500, 550, 575, 600, 625, 650, 650, 675, 700\n\nNext, let's find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) for both sets of data:\n\nScale A:\nQ1 = median of the first half = (100 + 110) / 2 = 105\nQ3 = median of the second half = (130 + 130) / 2 = 130\n\nScale B:\nQ1 = median of the first half = (500 + 550) / 2 = 525\nQ3 = median of the second half = (650 + 650) / 2 = 650\n\nNow, let's calculate the interquartile range (IQR) for both sets of data:\n\nIQR for Scale A = Q3 - Q1 = 130 - 105 = 25\nIQR for Scale B = Q3 - Q1 = 650 - 525 = 125\n\nA lower IQR indicates a smaller spread in the data, which means the measurements are more consistent. Since Scale A has a lower IQR (25) compared to Scale B (125), Scale A is more robust in terms of measuring the weights of apples."
