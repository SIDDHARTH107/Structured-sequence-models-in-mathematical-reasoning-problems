    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems and the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.\n\nFirst, let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P of G, which is of order 5^3 = 125. Let n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G. By the Sylow Theorems, n_5 must divide the index [G:P] = 125/125 = 1, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1, which means that P is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, and therefore P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we will analyze the structure of P. Since P is a group of order 125, by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C_125 (cyclic group of order 125)\n2. C_25 × C_5 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 25 and a cyclic group of order 5)\n3. C_5 × C_5 × C_5 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5)\n\nWe will show that the third possibility cannot occur. Suppose P is isomorphic to C_5 × C_5 × C_5. Let x, y, and z be the generators of the three cyclic groups of order 5, respectively. Then, the elements of P can be written as (x^a, y^b, z^c) where 0 ≤ a, b, c < 5. \n\nConsider the element (x, y, z) in P. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we have (x, y, z)^5 = (x^5, y^5, z^5) = (e, e, e), where e is the identity element. But this means that x^5 = y^5 = z^5 = e, which contradicts the assumption that x, y, and z are generators of cyclic groups of order 5. Therefore, P cannot be isomorphic to C_5 × C_5 × C_5.\n\nThus, we have shown that every group of order 125 is either cyclic (isomorphic to C_125) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25 (isomorphic to C_25 × C_5)."
