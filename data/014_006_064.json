    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using one-time pad encryption with the key \"71463\", we first need to convert both the message and the key into binary. Then, we perform the XOR operation between them.\n\n1. Convert the message \"HELLO\" into binary:\nH - 72 (ASCII) - 01001000 (binary)\nE - 69 (ASCII) - 01000101 (binary)\nL - 76 (ASCII) - 01001100 (binary)\nL - 76 (ASCII) - 01001100 (binary)\nO - 79 (ASCII) - 01001111 (binary)\n\n2. Convert the key \"71463\" into binary:\n7 - 55 (ASCII) - 00110111 (binary)\n1 - 49 (ASCII) - 00110001 (binary)\n4 - 52 (ASCII) - 00110100 (binary)\n6 - 54 (ASCII) - 00110110 (binary)\n3 - 51 (ASCII) - 00110011 (binary)\n\n3. Perform XOR operation between the message and the key:\n01001000 ⊕ 00110111 = 01111111\n01000101 ⊕ 00110001 = 01110100\n01001100 ⊕ 00110100 = 01111000\n01001100 ⊕ 00110110 = 01111010\n01001111 ⊕ 00110011 = 01111100\n\n4. Convert the binary result back to ASCII characters:\n01111111 - 127 (ASCII) - DEL (character)\n01110100 - 116 (ASCII) - t (character)\n01111000 - 120 (ASCII) - x (character)\n01111010 - 122 (ASCII) - z (character)\n01111100 - 124 (ASCII) - | (character)\n\nThe encrypted message is \"DELtxz|\"."
