    "message_2": "The shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere is along the great circle connecting those points. A great circle is the intersection of the sphere with a plane that passes through the center of the sphere.\n\nLet A = (2, 3, 1) and B = (-3, 4, -4) be the two points on the sphere. First, we need to find the angle between the vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin (0, 0, 0). We can use the dot product formula to find the angle:\n\nOA · OB = |OA| |OB| cos(θ)\n\nOA = A - O = (2, 3, 1)\nOB = B - O = (-3, 4, -4)\n\n|OA| = |OB| = radius of the sphere = 4\n\nOA · OB = (2 * -3) + (3 * 4) + (1 * -4) = -6 + 12 - 4 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (OA · OB) / (|OA| |OB|)\ncos(θ) = 2 / (4 * 4)\ncos(θ) = 1/8\n\nθ = arccos(1/8) ≈ 1.318 radians\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can find the shortest distance along the surface of the sphere using the formula:\n\ndistance = radius * angle\ndistance = 4 * 1.318 ≈ 5.272 units\n\nThe shortest distance the student can travel on the surface to reach the point (-3, 4, -4) is approximately 5.272 units.\n\nThe path the student should follow is along the great circle connecting points A and B. To find the equation of the plane containing the great circle, we can use the cross product of vectors OA and OB:\n\nN = OA × OB = (12, 10, 18)\n\nThe equation of the plane containing the great circle is:\n\n12x + 10y + 18z = D\n\nTo find D, we can plug in the coordinates of point A or B:\n\n12(2) + 10(3) + 18(1) = 24 + 30 + 18 = 72\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is:\n\n12x + 10y + 18z = 72\n\nThe path the student should follow is along the intersection of this plane with the sphere, which is the great circle connecting points A and B."
