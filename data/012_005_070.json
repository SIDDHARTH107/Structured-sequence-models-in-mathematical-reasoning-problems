    "message_2": "In graph theory, the diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices. A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n\nIn a complete graph with 7 vertices (also known as K7), every vertex is connected to every other vertex directly by an edge. Therefore, the shortest path between any two vertices is always 1 edge.\n\nSince the longest shortest path between any two vertices in K7 is 1 edge, the diameter of a complete graph with 7 vertices is 1."
