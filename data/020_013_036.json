    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to write down the constraints in a more explicit form. The matrix multiplication constraint can be written as:\n\n3x1 + x2 >= 1\nx1 + 2x2 >= 1\n\nNow, we can graph these inequalities along with the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx1 >= 0\nx2 >= 0\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all these inequalities. To find the optimal values for x1 and x2 that minimize the objective function x1 + x2, we can check the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n(0, 1), (1, 0), and (1/3, 1/3)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\nf(0, 1) = 0 + 1 = 1\nf(1, 0) = 1 + 0 = 1\nf(1/3, 1/3) = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3\n\nThe minimum value of the objective function is 2/3, which occurs at the point (1/3, 1/3). Therefore, the optimal values for x1 and x2 are x1 = 1/3 and x2 = 1/3."
