    "message_2": "To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$ over the unit circle in the plane, we first need to find the critical points of the function. The critical points are the points where the gradient of the function is zero or undefined. The gradient of the function is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy$$\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:\n\n$$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = y^2$$\n$$-6xy = 0$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either $x=0$ or $y=0$. If $x=0$, then from the first equation, we have $y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y=0$. This gives us the critical point $(0,0)$. If $y=0$, then from the first equation, we have $x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x=0$. This again gives us the critical point $(0,0)$. So, the only critical point is $(0,0)$.\n\nNow, we need to check the values of the function on the boundary of the unit circle, i.e., when $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. We can parameterize the unit circle using the angle $\\theta$ as follows:\n\n$$x = \\cos\\theta$$\n$$y = \\sin\\theta$$\n\nSubstituting these into the function, we get:\n\n$$f(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta)^3 - 3(\\cos\\theta)(\\sin\\theta)^2 = \\cos^3\\theta - 3\\cos\\theta\\sin^2\\theta$$\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum and minimum values of this function as $\\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$. To do this, we can find the critical points of this function with respect to $\\theta$. Taking the derivative with respect to $\\theta$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\theta}(\\cos^3\\theta - 3\\cos\\theta\\sin^2\\theta) = -3\\cos^2\\theta\\sin\\theta + 6\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta = -3\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta(2 - \\cos\\theta)$$\n\nSetting this derivative to zero, we get either $\\sin\\theta = 0$, $\\cos\\theta = 0$, or $\\cos\\theta = 2$. The last case has no solutions since $-1 \\leq \\cos\\theta \\leq 1$. For the other cases, we have the following solutions:\n\n1. $\\sin\\theta = 0 \\Rightarrow \\theta = 0, \\pi$\n2. $\\cos\\theta = 0 \\Rightarrow \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$\n\nEvaluating the function at these angles, we get:\n\n1. $f(\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = f(1, 0) = 1$\n2. $f(\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = f(-1, 0) = -1$\n3. $f(\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = f(0, 1) = 0$\n4. $f(\\cos \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\sin \\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = f(0, -1) = 0$\n\nComparing these values with the value of the function at the critical point $(0,0)$, we find that the absolute maximum value is $1$ and the absolute minimum value is $-1$.\n\nNow, we will use Morse inequalities to verify our answers. The Hessian matrix of the function is given by the second partial derivatives:\n\n$$H = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x & -6y \\\\\n-6y & -6x\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nAt the critical point $(0,0)$, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$$H(0,0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nSince the Hessian matrix is singular, we cannot determine the nature of the critical point using the second derivative test. However, we can use Morse inequalities to count the number of critical points with a certain index. The index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. Since the Hessian matrix at $(0,0)$ is singular, both its eigenvalues are zero, and the index is zero.\n\nMorse inequalities state that the number of critical points with index $k$ is greater than or equal to the $k$-th Betti number of the domain. The Betti numbers of the unit circle are $1, 0, 0, \\dots$. Since the index of the critical point $(0,0)$ is zero, Morse inequalities tell us that there must be at least one critical point with index zero, which is consistent with our findings.\n\nIn conclusion, the absolute maximum value of the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$ over the unit circle in the plane is $1$, and the absolute minimum value is $-1$. Morse inequalities confirm that our analysis of the critical points is consistent."
