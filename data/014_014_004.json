    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the keyword \"MATHS\":\n   M A T H S\n   B C D E F\n   G I K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n   (Note that I and J are combined into a single cell)\n\n2. Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters) and adjust if needed:\n   HE LL OW OR LD\n   (No adjustment needed in this case)\n\n3. Encrypt each digraph using the Playfair matrix:\n   - HE: H (row 1) and E (row 2) are not in the same row or column, so replace them with the letters at the opposite corners of the rectangle they form: H -> C, E -> K\n   - LL: L (row 3) and L (row 3) are in the same row, so shift each letter one position to the right (wrapping around): L -> N, L -> N\n   - OW: O (row 4) and W (row 5) are not in the same row or column, so replace them with the letters at the opposite corners of the rectangle they form: O -> P, W -> V\n   - OR: O (row 4) and R (row 4) are in the same row, so shift each letter one position to the right (wrapping around): O -> Q, R -> U\n   - LD: L (row 3) and D (row 2) are not in the same row or column, so replace them with the letters at the opposite corners of the rectangle they form: L -> E, D -> G\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the ciphertext:\n   CK NN PV QU EG\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"CKNNPVQUEG\"."
