Determine the possible group structures based on the prime factorization.\n\nFor a group of order 24, we have the following possibilities:\n\n- G is a direct product of two smaller groups, one of order 8 (2^3) and one of order 3 (3^1). In this case, there are 5 possible groups: 3 abelian groups of order 8 (Z_8, Z_4 x Z_2, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) and 2 non-abelian groups of order 8 (D_4 and Q_8). The group of order 3 is always Z_3. So, we have 5 possible direct products in this case.\n- G is a semi-direct product of two smaller groups, one of order 8 (2^3) and one of order 3 (3^1). In this case, there are 4 possible groups: 2 non-abelian groups of order 8 (D_4 and Q_8) and 2 abelian groups of order 8 (Z_8 and Z_4 x Z_2). The group of order 3 is always Z_3. So, we have 4 possible semi-direct products in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 5 + 4 = 9 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
