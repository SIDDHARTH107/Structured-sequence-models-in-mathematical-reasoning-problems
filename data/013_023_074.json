    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A must decide how much money, x, to send to Player B. The amount sent will be tripled by the experimenter, and Player B will then decide how much of the tripled amount to send back to Player A. If we assume that Player B only sends back half of the tripled amount, how much money should Player A send if they want to maximize their own profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of money Player A sends to Player B. The experimenter will triple this amount, so Player B receives 3x. If Player B sends back half of the tripled amount, they will send back (1/2)(3x) = (3/2)x.\n\nTo maximize their profit, Player A wants to maximize the difference between the amount they receive back and the amount they initially sent, which can be represented as:\n\nProfit = (3/2)x - x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nProfit = (1/2)x\n\nSince the profit is directly proportional to the amount sent by Player A (x), to maximize their profit, Player A should send as much money as possible to Player B. However, this decision also depends on the trust they have in Player B and the maximum amount they are allowed or willing to send in the game."
