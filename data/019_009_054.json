    "message_2": "To prove the statement \"If X is even then X+2 is even\" is true for X = 4, we need to show that when X is even (in this case, X = 4), X+2 is also even.\n\nAn even number is defined as an integer that is divisible by 2, which can be written as X = 2n, where n is an integer.\n\nGiven X = 4, we can see that it is an even number because it can be written as 2(2), where n = 2.\n\nNow, we need to show that X+2 is also even. In this case, X+2 = 4+2 = 6.\n\n6 can be written as 2(3), where n = 3. Since 6 is divisible by 2, it is also an even number.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If X is even then X+2 is even\" is true for X = 4."
