    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first few perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. Perfect numbers can be generated using the formula (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from Euclid's theorem.\n\nTo find the 7th perfect number, we need to find the 7th pair of prime numbers (p, 2^p - 1) that satisfy the formula. The first six pairs are:\n\n1. (2, 3) - 6\n2. (3, 7) - 28\n3. (5, 31) - 496\n4. (7, 127) - 8128\n5. (13, 8191) - 33,550,336\n6. (17, 131071) - 8,589,869,056\n\nThe 7th pair of prime numbers is (19, 524287). Plugging these values into the formula:\n\n(2^(19-1)) * (2^19 - 1) = (2^18) * (524287) = 137,438,691,328\n\nSo, the 7th perfect number is 137,438,691,328."
