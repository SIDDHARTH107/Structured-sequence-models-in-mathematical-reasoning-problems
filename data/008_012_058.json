    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  1 |\n    | 4  3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 5 |\n    | 11 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 3) - (1 * 4) = 6 - 4 = 2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we can find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A. The adjugate of A is found by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = |  3  -1 |\n         | -4   2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/2) * |  3  -1 |\n                 | -4   2 |\n\nA^(-1) = |  1.5  -0.5 |\n         | -2    1  |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  1.5  -0.5 | * | 5  |\n    | -2    1  |   | 11 |\n\nX = | (1.5 * 5) + (-0.5 * 11) |\n    | (-2 * 5) + (1 * 11)     |\n\nX = | 7.5 - 5.5 |\n    | -10 + 11  |\n\nX = | 2 |\n    | 1  |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2 and y = 1."
