    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 5x^3 + 7x^2 + 2x using the power rule, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 5x^3, n = 3, so the derivative is 3 * 5x^(3-1) = 15x^2.\n2. For the term 7x^2, n = 2, so the derivative is 2 * 7x^(2-1) = 14x.\n3. For the term 2x, n = 1, so the derivative is 1 * 2x^(1-1) = 2.\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^2 + 14x + 2"
