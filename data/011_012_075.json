    "message_2": "To find the number of students not taking either mathematics or physics, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of students = Students taking mathematics + Students taking physics - Students taking both mathematics and physics + Students not taking either\n\nLet's denote the number of students not taking either mathematics or physics as x.\n\n50 = 28 + 24 - 20 + x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n50 = 32 + x\n\nx = 50 - 32\n\nx = 18\n\nSo, 18 students are not taking either mathematics or physics."
