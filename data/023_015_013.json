    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of f(x) = x(10-x), we first need to find the Fourier series representation of f(x) on the interval [0, 10]. Since the function is defined on a finite interval and is not periodic, we will use the Fourier sine series representation. The Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ [B_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval (in this case, L = 10), and B_n is given by:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nNow, let's find B_n for f(x) = x(10-x):\n\nB_n = (2/10) * ∫[x(10-x) * sin(n * π * x / 10) dx] from 0 to 10\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x(10-x) and dv = sin(n * π * x / 10) dx\nThen du = (10-2x) dx and v = (-10/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 10)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[x(10-x) * sin(n * π * x / 10) dx] = uv - ∫[v * du]\n= (-10x/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 10) * (10-x) + (10/(n * π)) * ∫[cos(n * π * x / 10) * (10-2x) dx]\n\nNow, let's use integration by parts again:\n\nLet u' = (10-2x) and dv' = cos(n * π * x / 10) dx\nThen du' = -2 dx and v' = (10/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / 10)\n\n∫[cos(n * π * x / 10) * (10-2x) dx] = u'v' - ∫[v' * du']\n= (10/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / 10) * (10-2x) - (10/(n * π)) * ∫[-2 * sin(n * π * x / 10) dx]\n\nNow, integrate the remaining term:\n\n∫[-2 * sin(n * π * x / 10) dx] = (-20/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 10)\n\nPutting everything together:\n\nB_n = (2/10) * [(-10x/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 10) * (10-x) + (10/(n * π)) * ((10/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / 10) * (10-2x) - (10/(n * π)) * (-20/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 10))]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate B_n at the limits of integration (0 and 10) and subtract:\n\nB_n = (1/5) * [(-10 * 10/(n * π)) * cos(n * π) + (100/(n^2 * π^2)) * sin(n * π) - (200/(n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π)]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the sine term vanishes:\n\nB_n = (1/5) * [(-10 * 10/(n * π)) * cos(n * π) - (200/(n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π)]\n= (-100/(n * π)) * cos(n * π) - (40/(n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π)\n= (-100/(n * π) - 40/(n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier sine series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [((-100/(n * π) - 40/(n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / 10)]\n\nTo find the displacement of the wire at any time t, we need to solve the wave equation with the initial displacement given by the Fourier sine series. However, this requires additional information about the wave speed and boundary conditions of the wire. Once that information is provided, the wave equation can be solved to find the displacement of the wire at any time t."
