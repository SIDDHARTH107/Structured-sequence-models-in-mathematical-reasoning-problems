    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a possible question:\n\nIn the Beauty Contest Game, three players must choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner will be the player whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all three numbers. What number should each player choose to maximize their chances of winning, and what is the expected winning number?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning, each player should assume that the other two players are also trying to maximize their chances. Let's denote the chosen numbers as A, B, and C. The average of the three numbers is (A + B + C) / 3, and two-thirds of the average is (2/3) * (A + B + C) / 3 = (A + B + C) / (3 * (3/2)).\n\nSince all players are trying to maximize their chances, they will all choose a number that is two-thirds of the average of the other two players' numbers. Let's set up the equations for each player:\n\nA = (2/3) * (B + C) / 2\nB = (2/3) * (A + C) / 2\nC = (2/3) * (A + B) / 2\n\nWe can simplify these equations by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n2A = (2/3) * (B + C)\n2B = (2/3) * (A + C)\n2C = (2/3) * (A + B)\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations. From the first equation, we can express B in terms of A and C:\n\nB = (3/2) * A - (1/2) * C\n\nSubstitute this expression for B in the third equation:\n\n2C = (2/3) * (A + ((3/2) * A - (1/2) * C))\n2C = (2/3) * ((5/2) * A - (1/2) * C)\n\nNow, solve for A in terms of C:\n\nA = (3/5) * C\n\nNow, substitute this expression for A back into the expression for B:\n\nB = (3/2) * ((3/5) * C) - (1/2) * C\nB = (9/10) * C - (1/2) * C\nB = (4/10) * C\nB = (2/5) * C\n\nNow we have the relationship between A, B, and C:\n\nA = (3/5) * C\nB = (2/5) * C\n\nSince the numbers are between 0 and 100, we can find the value of C that maximizes the chances of winning by considering the upper limit:\n\nA + B + C = 100\n(3/5) * C + (2/5) * C + C = 100\nC = 100 / (1 + 3/5 + 2/5)\nC = 100 / 2\nC = 50\n\nNow, we can find the values of A and B:\n\nA = (3/5) * 50 = 30\nB = (2/5) * 50 = 20\n\nSo, each player should choose the following numbers to maximize their chances of winning:\n\nPlayer 1: 30\nPlayer 2: 20\nPlayer 3: 50\n\nThe expected winning number is the one closest to two-thirds of the average of these numbers:\n\nWinning number = (2/3) * (30 + 20 + 50) / 3 = (2/3) * 100 / 3 â‰ˆ 22.22"
