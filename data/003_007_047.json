    "message_2": "We are given a triangle with sides a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and c = 8 cm. We want to find the angle C opposite the side of length 8 cm. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the given side lengths:\n\ncos(C) = (5^2 + 7^2 - 8^2) / (2 * 5 * 7)\ncos(C) = (25 + 49 - 64) / 70\ncos(C) = 10 / 70\ncos(C) = 1/7\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C whose cosine is 1/7. We can use the inverse cosine function (also called arccos or cos^(-1)) to find the angle:\n\nC = arccos(1/7)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nC ≈ 81.79°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side of length 8 cm is approximately 81.79°."
