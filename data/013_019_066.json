    "message_1": "Suppose that two players, A and B, are trying to coordinate on one of two possible strategies in a game. The players can communicate with each other by sending cheap talk messages. Player A sends three messages, and player B receives those messages. The messages can be truthful or untruthful, and the receiver can tell the difference between the two. What is the probability that player B will believe player A's truthful messages and select the same strategy as player A?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the two strategies as S1 and S2. Let T represent a truthful message and U represent an untruthful message. Since player A sends three messages, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of messages that player A can send. These combinations are:\n\n1. TTT\n2. TTU\n3. TUT\n4. UTT\n5. TUU\n6. UTU\n7. UUT\n8. UUU\n\nNow, let's analyze each combination and determine if player B will believe player A's truthful messages and select the same strategy as player A.\n\n1. TTT: Player B receives three truthful messages and will believe player A, selecting the same strategy.\n2. TTU: Player B receives two truthful messages and one untruthful message. Since player B can tell the difference between truthful and untruthful messages, player B will believe the two truthful messages and select the same strategy as player A.\n3. TUT: Similar to case 2, player B will believe the two truthful messages and select the same strategy as player A.\n4. UTT: Similar to cases 2 and 3, player B will believe the two truthful messages and select the same strategy as player A.\n5. TUU: Player B receives one truthful message and two untruthful messages. Since player B can tell the difference between truthful and untruthful messages, player B will believe the one truthful message and select the same strategy as player A.\n6. UTU: Similar to case 5, player B will believe the one truthful message and select the same strategy as player A.\n7. UUT: Similar to cases 5 and 6, player B will believe the one truthful message and select the same strategy as player A.\n8. UUU: Player B receives three untruthful messages and will not believe any of them. Player B will not select the same strategy as player A.\n\nOut of the 8 possible combinations, 7 of them result in player B believing player A's truthful messages and selecting the same strategy as player A. Therefore, the probability that player B will believe player A's truthful messages and select the same strategy as player A is 7/8 or 87.5%."
