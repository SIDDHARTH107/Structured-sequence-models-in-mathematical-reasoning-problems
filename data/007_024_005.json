Find the discrete logarithm of 11 with respect to 2, i.e., solve for $x$ in the equation $2^x \\equiv 11\\pmod{13}$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the discrete logarithm problem, we need to find the value of $x$ such that $2^x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{13}$. We can do this by trying out different values of $x$ and checking if the equation holds true.\n\n1. For $x=1$, $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$.\n2. For $x=2$, $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$.\n3. For $x=3$, $2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}$.\n4. For $x=4$, $2^4 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$.\n5. For $x=5$, $2^5 \\equiv 32 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}$.\n6. For $x=6$, $2^6 \\equiv 64 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$.\n7. For $x=7$, $2^7 \\equiv 128 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{13}$.\n\nWe found that for $x=7$, the equation $2^x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{13}$ holds true. Therefore, the discrete logarithm of 11 with respect to 2 in the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}^*$ is $x=7$."
