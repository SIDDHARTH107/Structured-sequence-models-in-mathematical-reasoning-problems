    "message_2": "In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, Alice and Bob will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key $A$ as $A = g^a \\mod p$, where $g$ is the base, $a$ is her private key, and $p$ is the prime modulus.\n2. Bob computes his public key $B$ as $B = g^b \\mod p$, where $b$ is his private key.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key as $s_A = B^a \\mod p$.\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key as $s_B = A^b \\mod p$.\n\nSince both $s_A$ and $s_B$ are equal, we only need to compute one of them.\n\nLet's compute Alice's public key $A$:\n\n$A = g^a \\mod p = 5^6 \\mod 23 = 15625 \\mod 23 = 10$\n\nNow let's compute Bob's public key $B$:\n\n$B = g^b \\mod p = 5^{15} \\mod 23 = 30517578125 \\mod 23 = 19$\n\nNow let's compute the shared secret key using Alice's values:\n\n$s_A = B^a \\mod p = 19^6 \\mod 23 = 47045881 \\mod 23 = 2$\n\nSo the shared secret key is $2$."
