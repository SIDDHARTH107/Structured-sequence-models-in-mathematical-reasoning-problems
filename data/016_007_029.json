    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. A third-level Menger sponge is created by performing this process three times. To calculate the total surface area of a third-level Menger sponge, we need to know the surface area of the initial cube and the scaling factor at each level.\n\nLet's assume the initial cube has a side length of 1 unit. The surface area of a cube is given by the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 * side^2\n\nFor the initial cube, the surface area is:\n\nSurface area = 6 * 1^2 = 6 square units\n\nNow, let's consider the scaling factor. At each level of the Menger sponge, the side length of the smaller cubes is one-third of the side length of the larger cubes. Therefore, the surface area of the smaller cubes is (1/3)^2 = 1/9 of the surface area of the larger cubes.\n\nAt the first level, we remove 1 cube from the center of each face and 1 cube from the center of the entire structure, for a total of 7 cubes removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes, each with a surface area of 1/9 of the original cube. So, the total surface area at the first level is:\n\nSurface area = 20 * (1/9) * 6 = 40/3 square units\n\nAt the second level, we repeat the process for each of the 20 smaller cubes. Each of these cubes is divided into 20 even smaller cubes, for a total of 20 * 20 = 400 cubes. The surface area of these even smaller cubes is (1/9)^2 = 1/81 of the surface area of the original cube. So, the total surface area at the second level is:\n\nSurface area = 400 * (1/81) * 6 = 2400/81 square units\n\nFinally, at the third level, we repeat the process for each of the 400 smaller cubes. Each of these cubes is divided into 20 even smaller cubes, for a total of 400 * 20 = 8000 cubes. The surface area of these even smaller cubes is (1/9)^3 = 1/729 of the surface area of the original cube. So, the total surface area at the third level is:\n\nSurface area = 8000 * (1/729) * 6 = 48000/729 square units\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of a third-level Menger sponge is approximately 48000/729 â‰ˆ 65.87 square units."
