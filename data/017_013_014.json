    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 18 are there, and what are their isomorphism types?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 18, we first need to find the possible group structures. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. There are two possible structures for groups of order 18: C_18 (cyclic group) and C_2 × C_9 (direct product of two cyclic groups). However, both of these groups are abelian, so we need to look for a non-abelian group structure.\n\nA non-abelian group of order 18 must have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. Since the index of P in the group is 2, P is normal. Let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2. Then, the group G can be expressed as a semidirect product of P and Q: G = P ⋊ Q.\n\nNow, we need to determine the possible actions of Q on P. Since P is a group of order 9, it is either isomorphic to C_9 (cyclic group) or C_3 × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups). However, the latter is not possible because the automorphism group of C_3 × C_3 is isomorphic to GL(2,3), which has order 48 and does not have an element of order 2. So, P must be isomorphic to C_9.\n\nThe automorphism group of C_9, Aut(C_9), is isomorphic to the group of units of the integers modulo 9, which is (Z/9Z)^×. This group has order φ(9) = 6, where φ is the Euler's totient function. The group (Z/9Z)^× is isomorphic to C_6, the cyclic group of order 6. Since C_6 has an element of order 2, there is a non-trivial action of Q on P.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly one non-abelian group of order 18, which is the semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as C_9 ⋊ C_2."
