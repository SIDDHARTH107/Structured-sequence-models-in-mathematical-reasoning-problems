    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 7 cm and a height of 12 cm. Find the volume of the cone, rounded to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, r = 7 cm and h = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * (7²) * 12\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 49 * 12\nVolume = 3.14159 * 196\nVolume ≈ 615.752\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth, the volume of the cone is approximately 615.8 cubic centimeters."
