    "message_2": "To find the line of symmetry, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the function with respect to x and y:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy$$\n\nThe line of symmetry will be the line where the gradient of the function is zero. So, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$$\n$$-6xy = 0$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either x = 0 or y = 0. If x = 0, then the first equation becomes:\n\n$$-3y^2 = 0$$\n\nWhich implies y = 0. This gives us the trivial solution (0, 0), which does not lie on the curve f(x, y) = 0. So, we consider the case where y = 0. The first equation becomes:\n\n$$3x^2 = 0$$\n\nWhich implies x = 0. This again gives us the trivial solution (0, 0), which does not lie on the curve f(x, y) = 0. Therefore, there is no line of symmetry for this function.\n\nHowever, if we are looking for a point of symmetry (a point through which the curve is symmetric), we can consider the transformation (x, y) -> (-x, -y). Applying this transformation to the equation f(x, y) = 0, we get:\n\n$$f(-x, -y) = (-x)^3 - 3(-x)(-y)^2 - 1 = 0$$\n$$-x^3 - 3xy^2 - 1 = 0$$\n\nComparing this equation with the original equation, we can see that they are the same except for the sign of the x^3 term. This implies that the curve is symmetric about the origin (0, 0)."
