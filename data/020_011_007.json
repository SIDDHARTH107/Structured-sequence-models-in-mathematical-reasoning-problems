    "message_1": "Suppose we have a company that produces two products: Product A and Product B. The profit from selling Product A is $15 and from Product B is $25. The production process for both products uses the same machine and it takes 2 hours to produce Product A and 3 hours to produce Product B. The machine has a capacity of 100 hours per week. What is the optimal production strategy that maximizes the total profit while respecting the machine's capacity?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe profit function can be represented as:\nProfit = 15x + 25y\n\nThe constraint for the machine's capacity is:\n2x + 3y ≤ 100\n\nTo find the optimal production strategy, we need to maximize the profit function while respecting the constraint.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraint for y:\ny ≤ (100 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we can use the integer values of x and calculate the corresponding integer values of y to find the maximum profit.\n\nx = 0: y = 33 (maximum integer value)\nProfit = 15(0) + 25(33) = 825\n\nx = 1: y = 32 (maximum integer value)\nProfit = 15(1) + 25(32) = 815\n\nx = 2: y = 32 (maximum integer value)\nProfit = 15(2) + 25(32) = 830\n\nx = 3: y = 31 (maximum integer value)\nProfit = 15(3) + 25(31) = 820\n\nx = 4: y = 30 (maximum integer value)\nProfit = 15(4) + 25(30) = 790\n\nAs we continue to increase x, the profit will decrease. Therefore, the optimal production strategy is to produce 2 units of Product A and 32 units of Product B, which will result in a maximum profit of $830."
