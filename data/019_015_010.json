    "message_2": "The cardinality of the set of all functions from a set A with 5 elements to a set B with 2 elements can be found using the formula:\n\nCardinality = |B|^|A|\n\nIn this case, |A| = 5 (since there are 5 elements in set A) and |B| = 2 (since there are 2 elements in set B).\n\nCardinality = 2^5 = 32\n\nSo, the cardinality of the set of all functions from a set A with 5 elements to a set B with 2 elements is 32."
