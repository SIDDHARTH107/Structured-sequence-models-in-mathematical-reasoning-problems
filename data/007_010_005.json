    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive value of z that satisfies both congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The given congruences are:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\ny ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nWe want to find z such that:\n\nz ≡ x (mod 5)\nz ≡ y (mod 7)\n\nSince x ≡ 2 (mod 5), we can write x = 5a + 2 for some integer a. Similarly, since y ≡ 3 (mod 7), we can write y = 7b + 3 for some integer b.\n\nNow we want to find z such that:\n\nz ≡ 5a + 2 (mod 5)\nz ≡ 7b + 3 (mod 7)\n\nSince z ≡ 5a + 2 (mod 5), z must also be 2 more than a multiple of 5. So we can write z = 5c + 2 for some integer c.\n\nNow we have:\n\n5c + 2 ≡ 7b + 3 (mod 7)\n\nWe can simplify this congruence by reducing both sides modulo 7:\n\n5c + 2 ≡ 7b + 3 (mod 7)\n5c - 1 ≡ 7b (mod 7)\n-1 ≡ 7b - 5c (mod 7)\n\nNow we can try different values of c to find a solution for b:\n\nc = 1: -1 ≡ 7b - 5 (mod 7) => b ≡ 4 (mod 7)\nc = 2: -1 ≡ 7b - 10 (mod 7) => b ≡ 6 (mod 7)\nc = 3: -1 ≡ 7b - 15 (mod 7) => b ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nWe found a solution for b when c = 3. So b = 7d + 1 for some integer d. Now we can find the value of z:\n\nz = 5c + 2 = 5(3) + 2 = 17\n\nSo the smallest positive value of z that satisfies both congruences is z = 17."
