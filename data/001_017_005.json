    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the product rule which states that log_a(b) + log_a(c) = log_a(bc). Applying this rule to the given equation, we get:\n\nlog(base 3)((x - 5)(x + 1)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that a^(log_a(b)) = b. In this case, we have:\n\n3^2 = (x - 5)(x + 1)\n\n9 = x^2 - 5x + x - 5\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation and solve for x:\n\n9 = x^2 - 4x - 5\n\n0 = x^2 - 4x - 14\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -14:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(-14))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 56)) / 2\n\nx = (4 ± √72) / 2\n\nx = (4 ± 6√2) / 2\n\nx = 2 ± 3√2\n\nSo, the two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = 2 + 3√2 and x = 2 - 3√2"
