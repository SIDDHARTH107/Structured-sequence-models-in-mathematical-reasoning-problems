    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to match the coefficients of x in the second equation:\n\n2(x + y - 3z) = 2(7)\n2x + 2y - 6z = 14\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(2x + 3y - 9z) - (2x + 2y - 6z) = 21 - 14\ny - 3z = 7 (1)\n\nNext, multiply the first equation by -2 to match the coefficients of x in the third equation:\n\n-2(x + y - 3z) = -2(7)\n-2x - 2y + 6z = -14\n\nNow, add the first equation to the third equation:\n\n(-2x - 5y + 15z) + (-2x - 2y + 6z) = -35 + (-14)\n-4x - 7y + 21z = -49\n\nDivide this equation by -1:\n\n4x + 7y - 21z = 49\n\nNow, divide this equation by 4:\n\nx + (7/4)y - (21/4)z = 49/4 (2)\n\nNow, we have two equations (1) and (2) with two variables y and z:\n\ny - 3z = 7\nx + (7/4)y - (21/4)z = 49/4\n\nWe can now eliminate x by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) multiplied by -1:\n\n(-1)[x + (7/4)y - (21/4)z] = (-1)(49/4)\n-x - (7/4)y + (21/4)z = -49/4\n\nAdd this equation to equation (1):\n\n(-x - (7/4)y + (21/4)z) + (y - 3z) = -49/4 + 7\n(-1/4)y + (3/4)z = -1/4\n\nNow, multiply this equation by 4 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n-1y + 3z = -1\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 3z + 1\n\nNow, substitute this value of y back into equation (1):\n\n(3z + 1) - 3z = 7\n1 = 7\n\nThis equation is not true, which means there is no solution to this system of linear equations. The system is inconsistent."
