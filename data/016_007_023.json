    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube along with the six cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed, leaving 20 cubes.\n\nFor a Level-4 Menger sponge, we apply this process four times. The total number of smaller cubes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the level of the Menger sponge.\n\nFor a Level-4 Menger sponge:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^4 = 160,000\n\nSo, a Level-4 Menger sponge is made up of 160,000 smaller cubes."
