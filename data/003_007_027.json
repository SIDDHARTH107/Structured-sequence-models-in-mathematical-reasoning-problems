    "message_2": "To find the largest angle of the triangle, we need to find the angle opposite the longest side, which is 12 meters. We will use the Law of Cosines to solve for this angle. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c. In this case, a = 8 meters, b = 10 meters, and c = 12 meters. We want to find the angle C.\n\n12² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos(C)\n\n80 = 160 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 80 / 160\n\ncos(C) = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C whose cosine is 0.5. We can use the inverse cosine function (also called arccos) to do this:\n\nC = arccos(0.5)\n\nC ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the largest angle of the triangle is approximately 60 degrees."
