    "message_1": "Suppose we have a hyperbolic triangle with angles measuring 60 degrees, 70 degrees, and 50 degrees respectively. Find the length of the shortest side of this hyperbolic triangle if the curvature of the hyperbolic space is -1.",
    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the angles of a triangle is less than 180 degrees. The given triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 70 degrees, and 50 degrees, which sum up to 180 degrees. This means that the given triangle cannot exist in hyperbolic space, so it is not possible to find the length of the shortest side of this triangle in hyperbolic geometry."
