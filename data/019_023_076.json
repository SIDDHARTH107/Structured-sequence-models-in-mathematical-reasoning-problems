    "message_2": "To use the method of differences, we'll first find the differences between consecutive terms in the sequence:\n\n5 - 2 = 3\n10 - 5 = 5\n17 - 10 = 7\n26 - 17 = 9\n\nThe differences are 3, 5, 7, and 9. Since the differences are not constant, let's find the second differences:\n\n5 - 3 = 2\n7 - 5 = 2\n9 - 7 = 2\n\nThe second differences are constant, which indicates that the sequence is quadratic.\n\nNow, let's find the quadratic equation that generates the sequence. We can represent the equation as:\n\nan^2 + bn + c = T_n\n\nwhere T_n is the nth term in the sequence, and a, b, and c are constants.\n\nUsing the first three terms of the sequence, we can create a system of equations:\n\na(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 2\na(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 5\na(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 10\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\na + b + c = 2\n4a + 2b + c = 5\n9a + 3b + c = 10\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second and third equations, we get:\n\n3a + b = 3\n8a + 2b = 8\n\nDividing the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n4a + b = 4\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\na = 1\n\nNow we can find b:\n\n3a + b = 3\n3(1) + b = 3\nb = 0\n\nFinally, we can find c:\n\na + b + c = 2\n1 + 0 + c = 2\nc = 1\n\nSo, the quadratic equation that generates the sequence is:\n\nT_n = n^2 + 1\n\nNow, we can find the next term in the sequence (the 6th term):\n\nT_6 = 6^2 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37\n\nThe next term in the sequence is 37."
