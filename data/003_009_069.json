    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle as follows: Let A be the vertex with the 30-degree angle, and let B and C be the other two vertices. Let side AB have a length of 5 cm, and side AC have a length of 7 cm. We want to find the length of side BC and then add it to the other two sides to find the perimeter.\n\nSince we have an angle and two sides, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side BC. The Law of Sines states that:\n\n(a/sinA) = (b/sinB) = (c/sinC)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths opposite angles A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe have angle A and sides a and c, so we can use the Law of Sines to find angle C:\n\n(5/sin(30)) = (7/sinC)\n\nWe know that sin(30) = 1/2, so:\n\n(5/(1/2)) = (7/sinC)\n10 = 7/sinC\n\nNow, we can solve for sinC:\n\nsinC = 7/10\nC = arcsin(7/10) ≈ 44.42 degrees\n\nNow we can find angle B, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nB = 180 - 30 - 44.42 ≈ 105.58 degrees\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines again to find the length of side b (BC):\n\n(5/sin(30)) = (b/sin(105.58))\n\nAgain, sin(30) = 1/2, and we can find sin(105.58) ≈ 0.9659:\n\n(5/(1/2)) = (b/0.9659)\n10 = b/0.9659\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb ≈ 10 * 0.9659 ≈ 9.659\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter by adding the side lengths:\n\nPerimeter = 5 + 7 + 9.659 ≈ 21.659 cm"
