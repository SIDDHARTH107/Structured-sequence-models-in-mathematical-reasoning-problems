    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct invertible sheaves on X, up to isomorphism, we need to compute the Picard group of X, which is the group of isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves on X. \n\nFirst, we need to find the genus g of the curve X. To do this, we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve given by the degree d of the curve:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nThe given curve is y^2 = x^3 + x^2 - 4x + 4, which is a degree 3 curve (cubic curve) in the affine plane. Therefore, d = 3, and we can compute the genus:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 2(1)/2 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the degree of the divisor class group, which is the same as the degree of the Picard group. For a curve of genus g, the degree of the divisor class group is 2g - 2:\n\ndegree = 2g - 2 = 2(1) - 2 = 0\n\nSince the degree of the divisor class group is 0, the Picard group is isomorphic to the Jacobian variety of the curve X, which is an abelian variety of dimension g. In this case, the dimension of the Jacobian variety is 1, and it is isomorphic to the complex torus C/L, where L is a lattice in the complex plane.\n\nThe number of distinct invertible sheaves on X, up to isomorphism, is equal to the number of points in the Jacobian variety. Since the Jacobian variety is a complex torus, it has infinitely many points, and therefore there are infinitely many distinct invertible sheaves on X, up to isomorphism."
