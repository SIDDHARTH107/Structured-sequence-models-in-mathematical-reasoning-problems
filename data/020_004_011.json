    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The production of each product requires the use of two machines (M1 and M2). Each machine has limited availability, with machine M1 available for 100 hours, and machine M2 available for 120 hours. Product A requires 3 hours on M1 and 2 hours on M2, while Product B requires 2 hours on M1 and 4 hours on M2. The profit for Product A is $5 per unit, and $6 per unit for Product B. What is the maximum profit that can be obtained from producing these two products, given the machine availability constraints? Use quadratic programming to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using quadratic programming, we first need to set up the objective function and constraints. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 5x + 6y\n\nConstraints (machine availability):\n3x + 2y ≤ 100 (M1 availability)\n2x + 4y ≤ 120 (M2 availability)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity)\n\nNow, we can solve this problem using quadratic programming. However, since the objective function is linear and the constraints are linear inequalities, this problem can be more easily solved using linear programming.\n\nUsing the graphical method, we can plot the constraints on a graph and find the feasible region:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 100\ny ≤ (100 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (120 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 20), and (33.33, 0). We can now evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 6(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 30) = 5(0) + 6(30) = 180\n3. P(20, 20) = 5(20) + 6(20) = 220\n4. P(33.33, 0) = 5(33.33) + 6(0) = 166.65\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at the vertex (20, 20), with a profit of $220. Therefore, the factory should produce 20 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B to maximize the profit, given the machine availability constraints."
