    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = z^2 / (z-1) about the singular point z = 1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z-1). Let w = z - 1, so z = w + 1. Then, we have:\n\nf(z) = f(w+1) = (w+1)^2 / w\n\nNow, we can expand the numerator:\n\n(w+1)^2 = w^2 + 2w + 1\n\nSo, f(w+1) = (w^2 + 2w + 1) / w = w + 2 + 1/w\n\nNow, we can write the Laurent series expansion of f(w+1) as:\n\nf(w+1) = w + 2 + 1/w\n\nSince w = z - 1, we can substitute back to get the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = (z - 1) + 2 + 1/(z - 1)\n\nNow, let's determine the convergence of the series in the annulus 0 < |z-1| < 2. The Laurent series expansion of f(z) is:\n\nf(z) = (z - 1) + 2 + 1/(z - 1)\n\nThe first term (z - 1) is a polynomial and converges everywhere. The second term, 2, is a constant and also converges everywhere. The third term, 1/(z - 1), is a simple pole at z = 1, and converges for all z â‰  1.\n\nIn the annulus 0 < |z-1| < 2, the series converges for all points except the singular point z = 1. Therefore, the Laurent series expansion converges in the annulus 0 < |z-1| < 2, excluding the singular point z = 1."
