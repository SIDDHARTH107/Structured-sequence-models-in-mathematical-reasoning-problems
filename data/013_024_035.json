    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem:\n\nIn a group of 5 volunteers, each volunteer has two choices: either work on a community project or shirk off the responsibility. If all 5 volunteers work on the project, each volunteer will earn a reward of $100. If any one volunteer shirks off, however, none of the volunteers will receive the reward. Each volunteer receives a personal benefit of $20 for shirking. Assuming that the volunteers are rational and self-interested, what is the probability that all 5 volunteers will work on the project?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the choices of each volunteer and the possible outcomes. Since each volunteer has two choices (work or shirk), there are 2^5 = 32 possible combinations of choices for the group of 5 volunteers.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the probability that all 5 volunteers will work on the project. There is only 1 combination where all volunteers work on the project, which is when all of them choose to work.\n\nNow, let's consider the volunteers' rationality and self-interest. A volunteer will choose to work on the project if the expected reward from working is greater than the personal benefit from shirking. The expected reward from working is $100 multiplied by the probability that all other volunteers will also work. The personal benefit from shirking is $20.\n\nLet p be the probability that a volunteer will choose to work on the project. Then, the expected reward from working is $100 * p^4 (since there are 4 other volunteers). A volunteer will choose to work if:\n\n100 * p^4 > 20\n\nDivide both sides by 20:\n\n5 * p^4 > 1\n\nNow, take the fourth root of both sides:\n\np > (1/5)^(1/4)\n\np > 0.7598\n\nSince p > 0.7598, the probability that all 5 volunteers will work on the project is greater than 0.7598^5 â‰ˆ 0.2371 or 23.71%. However, this is an upper bound on the probability, as it assumes that the volunteers will always choose to work if the expected reward from working is greater than the personal benefit from shirking. In reality, the probability may be lower due to other factors not considered in this model."
