    "message_1": "According to a recent poll, 60% of eligible voters in a certain country support a certain political party. If a random sample of 200 voters is selected, what is the probability that more than 120 of them will support this political party?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as \"n choose k\"\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of voters in the sample, which is 200)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of voters who support the political party)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the percentage of eligible voters who support the political party, which is 0.6)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the percentage of eligible voters who do not support the political party, which is 0.4)\n\nWe want to find the probability that more than 120 voters support the political party, so we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 121, 122, ..., 200.\n\nP(X > 120) = P(X = 121) + P(X = 122) + ... + P(X = 200)\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities and then sum them up. However, this can be time-consuming and computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability.\n\nThe normal approximation involves finding the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution and then using the standard normal distribution (Z) to approximate the probability.\n\nMean (μ) = n * p = 200 * 0.6 = 120\nStandard deviation (σ) = √(n * p * (1-p)) = √(200 * 0.6 * 0.4) ≈ 6.93\n\nNow, we need to find the Z-score for k = 120.5 (we use 120.5 instead of 121 to apply the continuity correction):\n\nZ = (k - μ) / σ = (120.5 - 120) / 6.93 ≈ 0.072\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or calculator to find the probability that Z > 0.072. \n\nP(Z > 0.072) ≈ 0.4713\n\nSo, the probability that more than 120 voters in the sample of 200 support the political party is approximately 0.4713 or 47.13%."
