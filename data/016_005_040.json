    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. In the first iteration, there is 1 line segment. In the second iteration, there are 2 line segments. In each subsequent iteration, the number of line segments doubles.\n\nTo find the number of line segments after 7 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^(n-1), where n is the number of iterations.\n\nSo, after 7 iterations:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^(7-1) = 2^6 = 64\n\nThere would be 64 line segments after constructing the Cantor set through 7 iterations."
