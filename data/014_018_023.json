    "message_1": "In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting a message by replacing the letters of the plaintext with a different set of letters. In order to decrypt the message, one needs to know the substitution key. Suppose you intercept the following ciphertext:\n \nahmjglra hmnrla\n \nAssume this ciphertext was encrypted using a substitution cipher with the following key: \n \na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\nr g m c u s i w z e h o f t q d n j p a k l x b y\n \nUsing cryptanalysis of substitution ciphers, determine the original plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to replace each letter in the ciphertext with the corresponding letter in the original alphabet using the given substitution key.\n\nCiphertext: ahmjglra hmnrla\n\nSubstitution key:\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\nr g m c u s i w z e h o f t q d n j p a k l x b y\n\nUsing the substitution key, we can decrypt the message as follows:\n\na -> r\nh -> o\nm -> w\nj -> e\ng -> i\nl -> s\nr -> a\na -> r\nh -> o\nm -> w\nn -> e\nr -> a\nl -> s\na -> r\n\nPlaintext: rowisear weasar\n\nThe original plaintext message is \"rowisear weasar\"."
