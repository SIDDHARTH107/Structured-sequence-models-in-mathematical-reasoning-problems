    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set is a subset of A. Here's a proof using set theory:\n\nBy definition, a set B is a subset of a set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if and only if every element of B is also an element of A. In other words, for all x, if x ∈ B, then x ∈ A.\n\nNow, let's consider the empty set, denoted as ∅. The empty set is a set with no elements. Therefore, there are no elements x such that x ∈ ∅.\n\nTo prove that ∅ is a subset of A, we need to show that for all x, if x ∈ ∅, then x ∈ A. Since there are no elements in ∅, the statement \"x ∈ ∅\" is always false. In logic, a conditional statement (if P, then Q) is considered true if the antecedent (P) is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (Q). This is known as vacuous truth.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"if x ∈ ∅, then x ∈ A\" is true for all x, and we can conclude that ∅ ⊆ A. This holds for any set A, including a set with 5 elements."
