    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant (λ) is a universal constant that appears in the study of bifurcation diagrams of nonlinear maps, such as the logistic map. It is approximately equal to 4.66920. However, the Feigenbaum constant is not dependent on the growth rate parameter (r) of the logistic map.\n\nThe logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the population at time n, and r is the growth rate parameter.\n\nFor a given value of r, the logistic map exhibits different behaviors, such as fixed points, periodic orbits, or chaotic behavior. The Feigenbaum constant is related to the rate at which the bifurcations occur as r increases, but it does not depend on the specific value of r.\n\nTherefore, the value of the Feigenbaum constant (λ) remains approximately 4.66920, regardless of the growth rate parameter (r) being 3.7 or any other value."
