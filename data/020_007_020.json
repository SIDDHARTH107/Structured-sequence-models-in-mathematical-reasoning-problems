    "message_1": "Here's a problem for the math student to solve:\n\nA company needs to ship 30 packages to different locations across the city. There are 5 delivery trucks available, each with a capacity of 8 packages. The company wants to determine the minimum number of trips required to deliver all packages. How many trips are required, and which packages should be loaded onto each truck to minimize the total number of trips?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of trips, we should try to fully utilize the capacity of each truck. Since each truck can carry 8 packages, we can calculate the total capacity of all 5 trucks:\n\n5 trucks * 8 packages/truck = 40 packages\n\nNow, we need to deliver 30 packages, so we can divide the packages among the trucks as follows:\n\n1. Truck 1: 8 packages\n2. Truck 2: 8 packages\n3. Truck 3: 8 packages\n4. Truck 4: 6 packages\n5. Truck 5: 0 packages (not needed)\n\nIn this distribution, we are using 4 trucks, and they can deliver all 30 packages in a single trip. So, the minimum number of trips required is 1."
