    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of 6 cm and a height of 8 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle according to the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this case, the base (a) is 6 cm and the height (b) is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nc² = 6² + 8²\nc² = 36 + 64\nc² = 100\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √100\nc = 10\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is 10 cm."
