    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one accident was due to machinery failure, we can first find the probability that none of the accidents were due to machinery failure and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single accident is not due to machinery failure is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (or 80%).\n\nSince there were four accidents, the probability that all four accidents were not due to machinery failure is 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80 = 0.4096 (or 40.96%).\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one accident was due to machinery failure by subtracting the probability that none of the accidents were due to machinery failure from 1:\n\n1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 (or 59.04%).\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the four accidents was due to machinery failure is 59.04%."
