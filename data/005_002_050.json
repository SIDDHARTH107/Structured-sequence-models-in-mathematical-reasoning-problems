    "message_2": "To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true mean height of all students in the school, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (1.68 meters)\nt = t-score (which we will find using the t-distribution table)\ns = sample standard deviation (0.08 meters)\nn = sample size (50 students)\n\nSince we are looking for a 90% confidence interval, we will have 5% in each tail of the distribution (100% - 90% = 10%, and half of that is 5%). With 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49), we can find the t-score from a t-distribution table or using a calculator. The t-score for a 90% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.676.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 1.68 ± (1.676 * (0.08 / √50))\n\nCI = 1.68 ± (1.676 * (0.08 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 1.68 ± (1.676 * 0.0113)\n\nCI = 1.68 ± 0.0189\n\nThe 90% confidence interval for the true mean height of all students in the school is approximately (1.6611, 1.6989) meters."
