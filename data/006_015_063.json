    "message_1": "What is the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network within a given month, if the average number of ransomware attacks that occur in a month is 0.8 with a standard deviation of 0.2?  How probable is it to have less than 2 ransomware attacks in a month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. In this case, the interval is one month, and the average number of ransomware attacks (位) is 0.8.\n\n1. Probability of a ransomware attack occurring within a given month:\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X=k) = (e^(-位) * 位^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (ransomware attacks), k is the desired number of events, 位 is the average number of events, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nTo find the probability of at least one ransomware attack occurring within a given month, we can calculate the probability of no ransomware attacks (k=0) and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X=0) = (e^(-0.8) * 0.8^0) / 0! = e^(-0.8) = 0.4493\n\nP(at least one ransomware attack) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - 0.4493 = 0.5507\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring within a given month is approximately 55.07%.\n\n2. Probability of having less than 2 ransomware attacks in a month:\n\nTo find the probability of having less than 2 ransomware attacks in a month, we need to calculate the probabilities for k=0 and k=1 and add them together:\n\nP(X=0) = 0.4493 (calculated above)\n\nP(X=1) = (e^(-0.8) * 0.8^1) / 1! = 0.4493 * 0.8 = 0.3594\n\nP(less than 2 ransomware attacks) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) = 0.4493 + 0.3594 = 0.8087\n\nSo, the probability of having less than 2 ransomware attacks in a month is approximately 80.87%."
