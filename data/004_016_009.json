    "message_1": "A car travels from point A to point B at a constant speed of 50 mph. If the distance between point A and B is 200 miles, how long did it take for the car to cover this distance? Use the mean value theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we have a car traveling at a constant speed of 50 mph from point A to point B, which are 200 miles apart. We can represent the position of the car as a function of time, s(t), where s(t) is the distance traveled by the car at time t.\n\nSince the car is traveling at a constant speed, we can write the function as:\n\ns(t) = 50t\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel 200 miles. To do this, we can set s(t) equal to 200 and solve for t:\n\n200 = 50t\n\nt = 200 / 50\nt = 4\n\nSo it takes the car 4 hours to travel from point A to point B.\n\nNow, let's apply the Mean Value Theorem. The function s(t) is continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, 4]. We want to find a point c in the interval (0, 4) such that the derivative of s(t) at c is equal to the average rate of change of s(t) over the interval [0, 4].\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of s(t):\n\ns'(t) = d(50t) / dt = 50\n\nNow, let's find the average rate of change of s(t) over the interval [0, 4]:\n\n( s(4) - s(0) ) / (4 - 0) = (200 - 0) / 4 = 50\n\nSo the average rate of change of s(t) over the interval [0, 4] is 50 mph, which is equal to the derivative of s(t) at any point c in the interval (0, 4), since s'(t) = 50 for all t.\n\nThus, the Mean Value Theorem confirms that the car's constant speed of 50 mph is equal to the average rate of change of its position over the 4-hour interval, and it takes the car 4 hours to travel from point A to point B."
