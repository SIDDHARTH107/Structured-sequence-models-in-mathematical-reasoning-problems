    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 8 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 6 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nFirst, we will swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 8 \\\\ 3 & 6 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will eliminate the elements below the 1 in the top left corner. To do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 6 & -9 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nNext, we will divide Row 2 by 4 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 6 & -9 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we will eliminate the element below the 1 in the second row. To do this, we will perform the following row operation:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 6 * Row 2\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -12 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nFinally, we will divide Row 3 by -12 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we have the row echelon form of matrix A. Since all rows are non-zero, the rank of matrix A is 3."
