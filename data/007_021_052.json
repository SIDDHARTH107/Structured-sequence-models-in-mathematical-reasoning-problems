    "message_2": "Pollard's Rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding the smallest non-trivial factor of a composite number. Let's apply the algorithm to find the smallest prime factor of 4027.\n\n1. Choose a random function, usually f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N, where N is the number we want to factor (in this case, N = 4027).\n2. Initialize two variables x and y with some random values, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n   a. Update x using the function: x = f(x)\n   b. Update y twice: y = f(f(y))\n   c. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and N: d = GCD(|x - y|, N)\n   d. If d > 1, then d is a non-trivial factor of N.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 4027 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 4027 = 26\nd = GCD(|5 - 26|, 4027) = GCD(21, 4027) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 4027 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 4027 = 937\nd = GCD(|26 - 937|, 4027) = GCD(911, 4027) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) mod 4027 = 677\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(937)) = f(1433) = (1433^2 + 1) mod 4027 = 1303\nd = GCD(|677 - 1303|, 4027) = GCD(626, 4027) = 13\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, d = 13. Since 13 is a prime number, it is the smallest prime factor of 4027."
