    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of f(z) inside the circle |z| = 2, we can use the Argument Principle, which states that for a simple closed contour C and an analytic function f(z) inside and on C, the number of zeros minus the number of poles of f(z) inside C is equal to the change in the argument of f(z) along C divided by 2π.\n\nIn this case, f(z) is an entire function, so it has no poles. Therefore, we only need to find the change in the argument of f(z) along the contour C, which is the circle |z| = 2.\n\nLet C be the circle |z| = 2, parameterized by z(t) = 2e^(it) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Then, we have:\n\nf(z(t)) = (2e^(it))^3 - 2(2e^(it))^2 + 5(2e^(it)) - 6\n= 8e^(3it) - 8e^(2it) + 10e^(it) - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the change in the argument of f(z(t)) as t goes from 0 to 2π. To do this, we can compute the derivative of f(z(t)) with respect to t:\n\nf'(z(t)) = d(f(z(t)))/dt\n= 24ie^(3it) - 16ie^(2it) + 10ie^(it)\n\nNow, we can compute the change in the argument of f(z(t)) along C by integrating f'(z(t))/f(z(t)) with respect to t from 0 to 2π:\n\nΔarg(f(z(t))) = ∫(f'(z(t))/f(z(t))) dt from 0 to 2π\n\nHowever, this integral is quite complicated and not easy to compute directly. Instead, we can use the Rouche's theorem, which states that if two analytic functions f(z) and g(z) satisfy |f(z) - g(z)| < |f(z)| + |g(z)| on a simple closed contour C, then f(z) and g(z) have the same number of zeros inside C.\n\nIn this case, we can choose g(z) = z^3, since it has the same dominant term as f(z). Then, we have:\n\n|f(z) - g(z)| = |(- 2z^2 + 5z - 6)| ≤ 2|z|^2 + 5|z| + 6\n\nOn the circle |z| = 2, we have:\n\n2|z|^2 + 5|z| + 6 = 2(4) + 5(2) + 6 = 8 + 10 + 6 = 24\n\nNow, we need to compare this with |f(z)| + |g(z)|:\n\n|f(z)| + |g(z)| = |z^3 - 2z^2 + 5z - 6| + |z^3| ≥ |z^3| - |(- 2z^2 + 5z - 6)| + |z^3|\n= 2|z^3| - 24 = 2(8) - 24 = 16 - 24 = -8\n\nSince |f(z) - g(z)| < |f(z)| + |g(z)| on the circle |z| = 2, Rouche's theorem tells us that f(z) and g(z) have the same number of zeros inside the circle. Since g(z) = z^3 has 3 zeros (all at z = 0), f(z) must also have 3 zeros inside the circle |z| = 2."
