    "message_2": "To find the number of different subsets containing at least 3 integers, we can use the concept of combinations. In this case, we have a set of 5 integers, and we want to find the number of subsets with 3, 4, or 5 integers.\n\nFor subsets with 3 integers, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10\n\nFor subsets with 4 integers:\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5\n\nFor subsets with 5 integers (the set itself):\n\nC(5, 5) = 5! / (5!(5-5)!) = 1\n\nNow, we add the number of subsets for each case:\n\n10 (subsets with 3 integers) + 5 (subsets with 4 integers) + 1 (subset with 5 integers) = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 different subsets containing at least 3 integers."
