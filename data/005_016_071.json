The marks obtained by the students in two subjects - Mathematics and English - are given below:\n\nGroup 1: Mathematics (60, 80, 100, 55, 75, 90, 70, 85, 65, 95, 82, 78, 41, 68, 73, 77, 91, 83, 69, 72) and English (68, 90, 75, 82, 60, 80, 92, 73, 85, 77, 65, 72, 88, 62, 81, 76, 70, 87, 78, 93).\n\nGroup 2: Mathematics (68, 75, 88, 66, 72, 79, 83, 71, 60, 57, 62, 64, 69, 81, 74, 78, 80, 73, 89, 76) and English (85, 77, 80, 93, 63, 76, 82, 72, 68, 78, 90, 88, 92, 70, 84, 86, 75, 69, 73, 87).\n\nGroup 3: Mathematics (58, 72, 65, 89, 70, 75, 80, 86, 79, 61, 56, 67, 73, 68, 91, 83, 77, 74, 78, 81) and English (75, 88, 60, 80, 92, 73, 85, 77, 65, 72, 68, 81, 76, 70, 87, 78, 93, 82, 62, 81).\n\nUsing Discriminant Analysis, determine which group is superior in both subjects, and which group is superior in one subject only.",
    "message_2": "To perform Discriminant Analysis, we first need to calculate the mean and variance for each group in both subjects. \n\nGroup 1:\nMathematics: Mean = (60+80+100+55+75+90+70+85+65+95+82+78+41+68+73+77+91+83+69+72)/20 = 74.5\nEnglish: Mean = (68+90+75+82+60+80+92+73+85+77+65+72+88+62+81+76+70+87+78+93)/20 = 77.35\n\nGroup 2:\nMathematics: Mean = (68+75+88+66+72+79+83+71+60+57+62+64+69+81+74+78+80+73+89+76)/20 = 72.45\nEnglish: Mean = (85+77+80+93+63+76+82+72+68+78+90+88+92+70+84+86+75+69+73+87)/20 = 79.1\n\nGroup 3:\nMathematics: Mean = (58+72+65+89+70+75+80+86+79+61+56+67+73+68+91+83+77+74+78+81)/20 = 72.7\nEnglish: Mean = (75+88+60+80+92+73+85+77+65+72+68+81+76+70+87+78+93+82+62+81)/20 = 76.75\n\nNow, we will calculate the variance for each group in both subjects.\n\nGroup 1:\nMathematics: Variance = Σ(x - mean)^2 / n = (sum of (each score - 74.5)^2) / 20 = 214.65\nEnglish: Variance = Σ(x - mean)^2 / n = (sum of (each score - 77.35)^2) / 20 = 116.9275\n\nGroup 2:\nMathematics: Variance = Σ(x - mean)^2 / n = (sum of (each score - 72.45)^2) / 20 = 84.6475\nEnglish: Variance = Σ(x - mean)^2 / n = (sum of (each score - 79.1)^2) / 20 = 92.49\n\nGroup 3:\nMathematics: Variance = Σ(x - mean)^2 / n = (sum of (each score - 72.7)^2) / 20 = 109.61\nEnglish: Variance = Σ(x - mean)^2 / n = (sum of (each score - 76.75)^2) / 20 = 106.5475\n\nNow, we will perform the Discriminant Analysis using the mean and variance values.\n\nDiscriminant Function: D = (mean1 - mean2)^2 / (variance1 + variance2)\n\nFor Mathematics:\nD12 = (74.5 - 72.45)^2 / (214.65 + 84.6475) = 4.1025 / 299.2975 = 0.0137\nD13 = (74.5 - 72.7)^2 / (214.65 + 109.61) = 3.24 / 324.26 = 0.00999\nD23 = (72.45 - 72.7)^2 / (84.6475 + 109.61) = 0.0625 / 194.2575 = 0.00032\n\nFor English:\nD12 = (77.35 - 79.1)^2 / (116.9275 + 92.49) = 3.0625 / 209.4175 = 0.01462\nD13 = (77.35 - 76.75)^2 / (116.9275 + 106.5475) = 0.36 / 223.475 = 0.00161\nD23 = (79.1 - 76.75)^2 / (92.49 + 106.5475) = 5.5225 / 199.0375 = 0.02776\n\nBased on the Discriminant Analysis, we can conclude the following:\n\n1. Group 1 is superior in Mathematics as it has the highest mean score (74.5) and the highest discriminant value (0.0137) when compared to Group 2.\n2. Group 2 is superior in English as it has the highest mean score (79.1) and the highest discriminant value (0.02776) when compared to Group 3.\n\nTherefore, Group 1 is superior in one subject (Mathematics) and Group 2 is superior in one subject (English). No group is superior in both subjects."
