    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 24: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible divisors: There are (3+1)(1+1) = 8 divisors of 24.\n3. Determine the number of abelian groups: There are 3 abelian groups of order 24, namely Z_24, Z_2 x Z_12, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_6.\n4. Determine the number of non-abelian groups: We can use the formula for the number of groups of order p^aq^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are their respective powers. In this case, p = 2, q = 3, a = 3, and b = 1. The formula is:\n\n   G(p^aq^b) = (p^(a^2) - p^a)(q^(b^2) - q^b) / (p^a - p)(q^b - q)\n\n   G(2^3 * 3^1) = (2^(3^2) - 2^3)(3^(1^2) - 3^1) / (2^3 - 2)(3^1 - 3)\n   G(24) = (64 - 8)(3 - 3) / (6)\n   G(24) = 56 / 6\n   G(24) = 9.333...\n\nSince the number of groups must be an integer, we round down to 9. However, this includes the 3 abelian groups we already counted, so we subtract those to find the number of non-abelian groups:\n\n   9 - 3 = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nIn total, there are 3 abelian groups + 6 non-abelian groups = 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
