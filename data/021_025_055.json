    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I am unable to perform simulations or run algorithms. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) works and how it can be applied to your problem.\n\nThe Whale Optimization Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It uses a population-based approach to search for the optimal solution in the search space. In your case, the search space is the interval [-10, 10].\n\nHere's a general outline of the WOA algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales with random positions within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each whale in the population.\n3. Determine the best solution (whale) found so far.\n4. Update the position of each whale using the mathematical model of the WOA algorithm, which includes encircling prey, bubble-net attacking, and searching for prey.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the maximum number of iterations (50 in your case).\n6. The best solution found during the iterations is the optimal solution.\n\nTo apply the WOA algorithm to your problem, you would need to implement the algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB and run the simulation with the given parameters. The optimal value of x and the corresponding minimum value of f(x) would be the output of the algorithm.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 is a simple quadratic function, and its minimum value can be found analytically by completing the square or taking the derivative and setting it to zero. In this case, the optimal value of x is -1, and the corresponding minimum value of f(x) is 0. Using the WOA algorithm for this problem might be an overkill, but it can be a good exercise to understand the algorithm and its implementation."
