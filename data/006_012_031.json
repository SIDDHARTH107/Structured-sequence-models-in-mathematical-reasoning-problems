    "message_1": "In a specific neighborhood, the probability of a burglary occurring in a given week is 0.15. What is the probability that there will be at least one burglary in the next three weeks?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that there will be no burglaries in the next three weeks and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one burglary occurring.\n\nThe probability of no burglary in a given week is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\n\nThe probability of no burglaries in three consecutive weeks is the product of the probabilities of no burglary in each week: 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.614125.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the next three weeks by subtracting the probability of no burglaries from 1: 1 - 0.614125 = 0.385875.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the next three weeks is approximately 0.386 or 38.6%."
