    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of a graph, we need to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and edges {(1,2), (1,3), (3,4), (3,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)}.\n\nWe can visualize the graph as follows:\n\n1 -- 2\n|\n3 -- 4\n|\n5 -- 6\n|    |\n7 -- 6\n\nNow, let's try to color the graph using the minimum number of colors:\n\n- Color vertex 1 with color A: A -- 2\n- Color vertex 2 with color B: A -- B\n- Color vertex 3 with color B: A -- B\n  | \n  B -- 4\n- Color vertex 4 with color A: A -- B\n  | \n  B -- A\n- Color vertex 5 with color A: A -- B\n  | \n  B -- A\n  |\n  A -- 6\n- Color vertex 6 with color B: A -- B\n  | \n  B -- A\n  |\n  A -- B\n- Color vertex 7 with color C: A -- B\n  | \n  B -- A\n  |\n  A -- B\n  |\n  C -- B\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph using 3 colors (A, B, and C) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of the given graph G is 3."
