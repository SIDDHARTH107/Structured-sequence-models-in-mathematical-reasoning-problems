    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0, we can try to find its roots using various methods such as factoring, synthetic division, or numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson method. However, this polynomial does not have easily recognizable factors, so we will use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -1, and the leading coefficient is 3. The factors of -1 are ±1, and the factors of 3 are ±1 and ±3. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/3.\n\nNow, we will test these possible rational roots:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n3(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 2(1) - 1 = 3 - 5 + 2 - 1 = -1 ≠ 0\n\n2. For x = -1:\n3(-1)^3 - 5(-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 1 = -3 - 5 - 2 - 1 = -11 ≠ 0\n\n3. For x = 1/3:\n3(1/3)^3 - 5(1/3)^2 + 2(1/3) - 1 = 1/9 - 5/9 + 2/3 - 1 = 0\n\n4. For x = -1/3:\n3(-1/3)^3 - 5(-1/3)^2 + 2(-1/3) - 1 = -1/9 - 5/9 - 2/3 - 1 ≠ 0\n\nWe found that x = 1/3 is a rational root of the polynomial. Now, we will perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n        ________________________\n  1/3 |  3    -5      2      -1\n           1     -4/3    4/3\n        ________________________\n           3    -4      0      0\n\nSo, the remaining quadratic factor is 3x^2 - 4x. To find the remaining roots, we will solve the quadratic equation:\n\n3x^2 - 4x = 0\nx(3x - 4) = 0\n\nThis gives us the roots x = 0 and x = 4/3.\n\nThus, the roots of the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 are x = 1/3, x = 0, and x = 4/3."
