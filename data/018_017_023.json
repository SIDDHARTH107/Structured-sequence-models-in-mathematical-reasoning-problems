We need to first find the symmetric difference between the elements of A and B, and then compute the Cartesian product.\n\nA △ B = {1, 4} (1 is in A but not in B, and 4 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) x B:\n\n(A △ B) x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow we can compare the two results:\n\nA x (B △ B) = {}\n\n(A △ B) x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nSince the two results are not equal, we can conclude that (A x B) △ B and A x (B △ B) are not equal with respect to symmetric difference."
