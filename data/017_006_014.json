A cyclic group of order 35, i.e., G ≅ Z_35.\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, i.e., G ≅ Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nWe will show that either G is cyclic or G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to Z_35, and we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then G cannot be isomorphic to Z_35. In this case, we will show that G must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nBy Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 5 and an element of order 7. Let a be an element of order 5 and b be an element of order 7. Then, the cyclic subgroups generated by a and b are A = ⟨a⟩ and B = ⟨b⟩, respectively. Note that |A| = 5 and |B| = 7.\n\nSince the orders of A and B are coprime (i.e., gcd(5, 7) = 1), A ∩ B = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Now, consider the set AB = {ab : a ∈ A, b ∈ B}. We will show that AB is a subgroup of G.\n\nLet x, y ∈ AB. Then x = a₁b₁ and y = a₂b₂ for some a₁, a₂ ∈ A and b₁, b₂ ∈ B. Then xy⁻¹ = a₁b₁(a₂b₂)⁻¹ = a₁b₁b₂⁻¹a₂⁻¹. Since A and B are normal subgroups (as they are cyclic), we have b₁b₂⁻¹ ∈ B and a₂⁻¹a₁ ∈ A. Thus, xy⁻¹ ∈ AB, and so AB is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we have |AB| = |A||B| = 5 * 7 = 35, which implies that AB = G. Since A and B are both normal subgroups of G, we have G ≅ A × B ≅ Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is cyclic or G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
