    "message_1": "A Sierpinski arrowhead curve is created by dividing an equilateral triangle into three smaller equilateral triangles and removing the central one, then doing the same for each remaining smaller triangle. If the length of the original triangle is 6cm, what is the perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the third iteration?",
    "message_2": "After each iteration, the perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve increases by a factor of 2. Let's calculate the perimeter after the third iteration:\n\n1st iteration:\nPerimeter = 6 cm * 2 = 12 cm\n\n2nd iteration:\nPerimeter = 12 cm * 2 = 24 cm\n\n3rd iteration:\nPerimeter = 24 cm * 2 = 48 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the third iteration is 48 cm."
