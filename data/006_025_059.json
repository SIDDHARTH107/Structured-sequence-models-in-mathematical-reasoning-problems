    "message_1": "A magician has a deck of cards with 52 cards. He shuffles the deck and places 3 cards face down on the table. What is the probability that all three cards are aces?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that all three cards are aces, we can use the formula for probability: P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are 4 aces in a deck of 52 cards. When the magician draws the first card, the probability of it being an ace is 4/52. \n\nIf the first card is an ace, there are now 3 aces left in the deck and 51 cards remaining. The probability of the second card being an ace is 3/51.\n\nIf the first two cards are aces, there are now 2 aces left in the deck and 50 cards remaining. The probability of the third card being an ace is 2/50.\n\nTo find the probability of all three events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n\nP(All three cards are aces) = (4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) = 24 / 132600 = 1 / 5525\n\nSo the probability that all three cards are aces is 1/5525."
