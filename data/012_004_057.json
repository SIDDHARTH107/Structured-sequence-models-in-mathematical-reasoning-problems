    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an arbitrary vertex (let's choose A).\n2. Find the minimum weight edge connected to the current vertex (A) and add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the new vertex (connected by the minimum weight edge) to the set of visited vertices.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all vertices are visited.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. Start with vertex A.\n2. The minimum weight edge connected to A is AD with weight 5.\n3. Add vertex D to the visited set {A, D}.\n\nNext iteration:\n\n1. The minimum weight edge connected to vertices A and D is DF with weight 6.\n2. Add vertex F to the visited set {A, D, F}.\n\nNext iteration:\n\n1. The minimum weight edge connected to vertices A, D, and F is AB with weight 7.\n2. Add vertex B to the visited set {A, D, F, B}.\n\nNext iteration:\n\n1. The minimum weight edge connected to vertices A, D, F, and B is BE with weight 7.\n2. Add vertex E to the visited set {A, D, F, B, E}.\n\nNext iteration:\n\n1. The minimum weight edge connected to vertices A, D, F, B, and E is CE with weight 5.\n2. Add vertex C to the visited set {A, D, F, B, E, C}.\n\nNext iteration:\n\n1. The minimum weight edge connected to vertices A, D, F, B, E, and C is EG with weight 9.\n2. Add vertex G to the visited set {A, D, F, B, E, C, G}.\n\nNext iteration:\n\n1. The minimum weight edge connected to vertices A, D, F, B, E, C, and G is GH with weight 10.\n2. Add vertex H to the visited set {A, D, F, B, E, C, G, H}.\n\nNow all vertices are visited, and the minimum spanning tree is formed by the edges: AD, DF, AB, BE, CE, EG, and GH.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is:\n\nA - D (5)\nD - F (6)\nA - B (7)\nB - E (7)\nE - C (5)\nE - G (9)\nG - H (10)\n\nTotal weight: 5 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 10 = 49."
