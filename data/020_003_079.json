    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. For the production of each product, they need to invest a certain amount of resources such as labor, raw material, and machines. The company has 2000 hours of labor, 1000 kg of raw material, and 150 machines available per week. Product X yields a profit of $5 per unit and requires 5 hours of labor, 2 kg of raw material, and 2 machines. Product Y yields a profit of $7 per unit and requires 7 hours of labor, 1 kg of raw material, and 4 machines. \n\nWhat should be the production of each product to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal production quantities of products X and Y. Let's denote the number of units of product X produced as x and the number of units of product Y produced as y. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 5x + 7y ≤ 2000\n2. Raw material constraint: 2x + y ≤ 1000\n3. Machines constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 150\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nWe will solve this problem using the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 5x + 7y = 2000 (Labor constraint)\n   y = (2000 - 5x) / 7\n\n2. 2x + y = 1000 (Raw material constraint)\n   y = 1000 - 2x\n\n3. 2x + 4y = 150 (Machines constraint)\n   y = (150 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of labor and raw material constraints:\n   5x + 7(1000 - 2x) = 2000\n   5x + 7000 - 14x = 2000\n   -9x = -5000\n   x = 5000/9 ≈ 555.56\n   y = 1000 - 2(5000/9) ≈ -111.11 (not feasible, since y must be non-negative)\n\n2. Intersection of labor and machines constraints:\n   5x + 7((150 - 2x) / 4) = 2000\n   20x + 7(150 - 2x) = 8000\n   20x + 1050 - 14x = 8000\n   6x = 6950\n   x = 6950 / 6 ≈ 1158.33 (not feasible, since it exceeds the raw material constraint)\n\n3. Intersection of raw material and machines constraints:\n   2x + (1000 - 2x) = 150\n   1000 - x = 150\n   x = 850\n   y = 1000 - 2(850) = 300\n\nSo, the feasible region has only one vertex at (850, 300). Therefore, the optimal production quantities to maximize the profit are 850 units of product X and 300 units of product Y."
