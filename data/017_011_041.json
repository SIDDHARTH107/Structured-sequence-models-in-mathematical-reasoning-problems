    "message_2": "Case 1: G contains an element of order 12.\nLet a be an element of order 12 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, has order 12. Since the order of <a> is equal to the order of G, it follows that G = <a>. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 12, and it is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: G does not contain an element of order 12.\nBy Cauchy's theorem, G must contain elements of order 2 and 3, since 2 and 3 are prime divisors of 12. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroups generated by a and b, denoted by <a> and <b>, have orders 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nSince the orders of <a> and <b> are coprime, the intersection of <a> and <b> is the identity element, and the product of their orders is equal to the order of their internal direct product, which is |<a> x <b>| = 2 * 3 = 6. Now, consider the subgroup H = <a> x <b> of G. Since |H| = 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the index of H in G is [G : H] = |G| / |H| = 12 / 6 = 2.\n\nBy the second isomorphism theorem, G / N(H) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group S2, where N(H) is the normalizer of H in G. Since S2 has only two elements, G / N(H) must be either the trivial group or S2 itself. If G / N(H) is the trivial group, then N(H) = G, which implies that H is normal in G. In this case, G is the internal direct product of <a> and <b>, and since <a> is of order 2 and <b> is of order 3, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nIf G / N(H) is isomorphic to S2, then G has a normal subgroup of index 2, which must be A4, the alternating group of degree 4. In this case, G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G does not contain an element of order 12, then G is isomorphic to either the alternating group A4 or the dihedral group D6."
