    "message_2": "To determine the current through an RLC circuit, we first need to find the impedance (Z) of the circuit. The impedance of an RLC series circuit is given by the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, XL is the inductive reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance.\n\nFirst, let's find the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC).\n\nXL = 2 * π * f * L\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, L is the inductance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven values:\nR = 10 ohms\nC = 4 * 10^-6 F (4 microfarads)\nL = 15 * 10^-3 H (15 millihenries)\nf = 60 Hz\n\nNow, let's calculate XL and XC:\n\nXL = 2 * π * 60 * 15 * 10^-3 = 5.655 * 10^-3 H ≈ 5.655 H\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * 60 * 4 * 10^-6) = 0.663 * 10^-6 F ≈ 0.663 F\n\nNow, we can find the impedance (Z):\n\nZ = √(10^2 + (5.655 - 0.663)^2) = √(100 + 24.98) ≈ 11.18 ohms\n\nFinally, we can find the current (I) using Ohm's Law:\n\nI = V / Z\n\nwhere V is the voltage.\n\nGiven value:\nV = 120 V\n\nNow, let's calculate the current:\n\nI = 120 / 11.18 ≈ 10.73 A\n\nTherefore, the current through the RLC circuit is approximately 10.73 A."
