    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns with the constants (Dx and Dy).\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + y = 10\n3x - 4y = 2\n\nThe coefficient matrix (A) and the constant matrix (B) are:\n\nA = | 2  1 |\n    | 3 -4 |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    |  2 |\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D):\n\nD = | 2  1 |\n    | 3 -4 |\n\nD = (2 * -4) - (1 * 3)\nD = -8 - 3\nD = -11\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the first column of A with B (Dx):\n\nDx = | 10  1 |\n     |  2 -4 |\n\nDx = (10 * -4) - (1 * 2)\nDx = -40 - 2\nDx = -42\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the second column of A with B (Dy):\n\nDy = | 2 10 |\n     | 3  2 |\n\nDy = (2 * 2) - (10 * 3)\nDy = 4 - 30\nDy = -26\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = Dx / D\nx = -42 / -11\nx = 42/11\n\ny = Dy / D\ny = -26 / -11\ny = 26/11\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 42/11\ny = 26/11"
