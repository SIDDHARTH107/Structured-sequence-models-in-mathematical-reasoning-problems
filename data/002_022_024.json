    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 6 cm and r = 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 6 * 3^3\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 6 * 27\n\nVolume = 324 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 1017.88 cubic centimeters."
