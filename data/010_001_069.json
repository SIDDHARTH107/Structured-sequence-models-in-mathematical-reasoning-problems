Prove that if $A\\subset X$ is closed and $B\\subset X$ is open, then $A\\setminus B$ is closed. \n\nAssuming $X=\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ is the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$, let $A=[0,1]$ and let $B=(0,2)$ be open in $\\mathbb{R}$. Prove that $A\\setminus B$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $A\\setminus B$ is closed, we will show that its complement in $X$ is open. Recall that the complement of a set $C$ in $X$ is denoted by $X\\setminus C$ or $C^c$. \n\nLet $C = A\\setminus B$. Then, we want to show that $(A\\setminus B)^c$ is open. Note that $(A\\setminus B)^c = (A^c \\cup B)$, by De Morgan's laws. Since $A$ is closed, its complement $A^c$ is open. Also, $B$ is given to be open. The union of two open sets is open, so $(A^c \\cup B)$ is open. Therefore, $A\\setminus B$ is closed.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific example with $X=\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ being the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$. We have $A=[0,1]$ and $B=(0,2)$. We want to show that $A\\setminus B$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology.\n\nFirst, find $A\\setminus B$. We have $A\\setminus B = [0,1]\\setminus(0,2) = \\{0\\}$. Now, we want to show that the complement of $\\{0\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is open. The complement of $\\{0\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is $(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)$. Both $(-\\infty, 0)$ and $(0, \\infty)$ are open intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology, and their union is also open. Therefore, the complement of $\\{0\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is open, which implies that $\\{0\\}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology."
