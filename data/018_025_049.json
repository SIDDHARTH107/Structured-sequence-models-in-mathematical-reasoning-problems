In this case, A Δ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}.\n\nSimilarly, B Δ A is the set of elements that are in B or A, but not in both. In this case, B Δ A = {1, 2, 5, 6}.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of these two sets, (A Δ B) ∩ (B Δ A). The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIn this case, (A Δ B) ∩ (B Δ A) = {1, 2, 5, 6}, as all the elements are common to both sets."
