    "message_1": "Assume that you are given a dataset having dimensions 10x5, and you need to apply Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions. Find the number of principal components required to explain 95% of the variance in the dataset.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of principal components required to explain 95% of the variance in the dataset, we need to first perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset. After performing PCA, we will obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding to each principal component.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the proportion of variance explained by each principal component. This can be done by dividing the eigenvalue of each principal component by the sum of all eigenvalues.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest number of principal components that together explain at least 95% of the total variance. This can be done by sorting the principal components in descending order based on their proportion of variance explained and then selecting the top principal components until the cumulative variance explained reaches or exceeds 95%.\n\nSince we do not have the actual dataset or its eigenvalues, we cannot provide the exact number of principal components required. However, you can follow the steps mentioned above to find the number of principal components needed for your specific dataset."
