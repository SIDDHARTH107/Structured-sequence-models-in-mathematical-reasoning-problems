    "message_1": "A manufacturing company is designing a rectangular box with a volume of 400 cubic inches. The cost of materials for the bottom of the box is $0.10 per square inch and the cost of materials for the sides of the box is $0.05 per square inch. What are the length, width, and height of the least expensive box that can be made?",
    "message_2": "Let the length, width, and height of the box be l, w, and h, respectively. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = lwh = 400 cubic inches\n\nThe cost of the bottom of the box is $0.10 per square inch, and the area of the bottom is lw. So, the cost of the bottom is:\n\nCost_bottom = 0.10lw\n\nThe cost of the sides of the box is $0.05 per square inch. There are four sides, two with area lh and two with area wh. So, the cost of the sides is:\n\nCost_sides = 0.05(2lh + 2wh)\n\nThe total cost of the box is the sum of the cost of the bottom and the cost of the sides:\n\nTotal_cost = Cost_bottom + Cost_sides = 0.10lw + 0.05(2lh + 2wh)\n\nWe want to minimize the total cost while maintaining the volume constraint (V = 400). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We will introduce a new variable λ (the Lagrange multiplier) and form the following equation:\n\nF(l, w, h, λ) = 0.10lw + 0.05(2lh + 2wh) + λ(400 - lwh)\n\nNow, we will take the partial derivatives of F with respect to l, w, h, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂F/∂l = 0.10w + 0.05(2h) - λwh = 0\n∂F/∂w = 0.10l + 0.05(2h) - λlh = 0\n∂F/∂h = 0.05(2l + 2w) - λlw = 0\n∂F/∂λ = 400 - lwh = 0\n\nWe now have a system of four equations with four unknowns (l, w, h, and λ). Solving this system of equations, we get:\n\nl = 10 inches\nw = 5 inches\nh = 8 inches\n\nSo, the least expensive box that can be made has dimensions of length 10 inches, width 5 inches, and height 8 inches."
