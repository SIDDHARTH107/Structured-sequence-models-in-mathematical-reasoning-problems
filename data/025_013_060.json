    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian matrix of the curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 4x^2 + 3x at the point (1,2), we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y.\n\nLet F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x. Then the curve is defined by the equation F(x, y) = 0.\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives of F with respect to x and y:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 8x - 3\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1,2):\n\n∂F/∂x(1,2) = -3(1)^2 - 8(1) - 3 = -14\n∂F/∂y(1,2) = 2(2) = 4\n\nFinally, we form the Jacobian matrix J_F(x, y) using these partial derivatives:\n\nJ_F(x, y) = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n                 | -14         4    |\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix of the curve at the point (1,2) is:\n\n| -14  4 |"
