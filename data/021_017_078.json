    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6 using the differential evolution algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population with 20 random individuals (x values) within the range [-5, 5].\n2. For each iteration, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each individual in the population, create a trial vector by combining the individual with two other randomly selected individuals using the mutation and crossover operations.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the trial vector (i.e., the value of f(x) for the trial vector).\n   c. If the trial vector's fitness is better than the original individual's fitness, replace the original individual with the trial vector.\n3. Repeat step 2 for 100 iterations.\n4. Select the individual with the best fitness as the solution.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the differential evolution algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 5*x + 6\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, max_iter):\n    population = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], pop_size)\n    best_individual = population[np.argmin([f(x) for x in population])]\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            idxs = [idx for idx in range(pop_size) if idx != i]\n            a, b, c = population[np.random.choice(idxs, 3, replace=False)]\n            mutant = a + 0.8 * (b - c)\n\n            if np.random.rand() < 0.9:\n                trial = mutant\n            else:\n                trial = population[i]\n\n            if f(trial) < f(population[i]):\n                population[i] = trial\n\n            if f(population[i]) < f(best_individual):\n                best_individual = population[i]\n\n    return best_individual\n\npop_size = 20\nbounds = [-5, 5]\nmax_iter = 100\n\nresult = differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, max_iter)\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x) is found at x =\", result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the value of x that minimizes f(x) within the given range and constraints. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm."
