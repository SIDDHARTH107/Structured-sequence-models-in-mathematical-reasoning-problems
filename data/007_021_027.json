    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a pseudo-random function. Here's how we can apply it to find the GCD of 1234 and 5678:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N, where N is the product of the two numbers (1234 * 5678).\n\n2. Initialize two variables x and y with an initial value, say 2. \n\n3. Iterate the following steps until the GCD is found:\n   a. Update x using the function f(x).\n   b. Update y using the function f(f(y)).\n   c. Calculate the GCD of |x - y| and N.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\nN = 1234 * 5678 = 7006652\n\nInitial values:\nx = 2\ny = 2\n\nFirst iteration:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 7006652 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 7006652 = 26\nGCD(|x - y|, N) = GCD(|5 - 26|, 7006652) = GCD(21, 7006652)\n\nSince GCD(21, 7006652) = 1, we continue to the next iteration.\n\nSecond iteration:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 7006652 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 7006652 = 458330\nGCD(|x - y|, N) = GCD(|26 - 458330|, 7006652) = GCD(458304, 7006652)\n\nNow, GCD(458304, 7006652) = 2, which is the greatest common divisor of 1234 and 5678."
