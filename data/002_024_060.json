    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply need to add the lengths of all four sides.\n\nThe parallel sides have lengths of 6 cm and 8 cm, and the nonparallel sides are both equal and measure 5 cm each.\n\nPerimeter = (6 cm) + (8 cm) + (5 cm) + (5 cm) = 24 cm\n\nThe perimeter of this trapezium is 24 cm."
