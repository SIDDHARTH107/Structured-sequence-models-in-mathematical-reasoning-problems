    "message_1": "A Sierpinski arrowhead curve is constructed by starting with an equilateral triangle with side length 1, dividing it into four triangles of equal size, and removing the middle triangle. Repeat the process for each remaining triangle (excluding the removed triangle) to obtain the next iteration of the curve. \n\nIf the curve's length after the 5th iteration is L, what is the new length of the curve after the 6th iteration?",
    "message_2": "For each iteration of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 2. This is because each side of the equilateral triangle is replaced by two sides of equal length, forming a new equilateral triangle with twice the number of sides.\n\nSo, if the length of the curve after the 5th iteration is L, the length of the curve after the 6th iteration will be 2L."
