    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 1/(x+2) over the interval [-3, 3], we first need to determine if the function is even, odd, or neither. Since f(-x) ≠ f(x) and f(-x) ≠ -f(x), the function is neither even nor odd. Therefore, we will use the general Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ [an * cos(nπx/L) + bn * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, an and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, L = (3 - (-3))/2 = 3. Now, we need to find the Fourier coefficients an and bn:\n\nan = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\nbn = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a0:\n\na0 = (1/3) * ∫[-3, 3] 1/(x+2) dx\n   = (1/3) * [ln|x+2|] (from -3 to 3)\n   = (1/3) * (ln(5) - ln(1))\n   = (1/3) * ln(5)\n\nNow, let's find an for n ≥ 1:\n\nan = (1/3) * ∫[-3, 3] (1/(x+2)) * cos(nπx/3) dx\n\nThis integral is not elementary, so we will use the result of the integral directly:\n\nan = (2/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n * cos(nπ))\n\nNow, let's find bn for n ≥ 1:\n\nbn = (1/3) * ∫[-3, 3] (1/(x+2)) * sin(nπx/3) dx\n\nAgain, this integral is not elementary, so we will use the result of the integral directly:\n\nbn = (2/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n * sin(nπ))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = 1/(x+2) over the interval [-3, 3]:\n\nf(x) = (ln(5)/6) + Σ [(2/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n * cos(nπ)) * cos(nπx/3) + (2/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n * sin(nπ)) * sin(nπx/3)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = 1/(x+2) over the interval [-3, 3]."
