    "message_1": "A digital signature scheme uses RSA with a modulus of 2048 bits, and each signature consists of two 2048-bit integers. What is the size, in bytes, of a signature generated by this scheme?",
    "message_2": "To find the size of a signature in bytes, we first need to convert the bit size to bytes. There are 8 bits in a byte. Since each signature consists of two 2048-bit integers, the total number of bits in a signature is 2 * 2048 = 4096 bits.\n\nNow, we can convert the bit size to bytes by dividing by 8:\n\n4096 bits / 8 bits per byte = 512 bytes\n\nSo, the size of a signature generated by this scheme is 512 bytes."
