    "message_1": "Consider a mechanism with two agents and two possible outcomes. Agent 1's values for each outcome are 3 and 0, while Agent 2's values are 2 and 1. What is the optimal mechanism to maximize social welfare? Calculate the total welfare achieved by the mechanism.",
    "message_2": "To maximize social welfare, we want to choose the outcome that maximizes the sum of the agents' values for that outcome. Let's denote the outcomes as A and B. The values of the agents for each outcome are as follows:\n\nOutcome A:\nAgent 1: 3\nAgent 2: 2\n\nOutcome B:\nAgent 1: 0\nAgent 2: 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the total welfare for each outcome:\n\nOutcome A: 3 (Agent 1) + 2 (Agent 2) = 5\nOutcome B: 0 (Agent 1) + 1 (Agent 2) = 1\n\nSince the total welfare for Outcome A (5) is greater than the total welfare for Outcome B (1), the optimal mechanism to maximize social welfare is to choose Outcome A. The total welfare achieved by this mechanism is 5."
