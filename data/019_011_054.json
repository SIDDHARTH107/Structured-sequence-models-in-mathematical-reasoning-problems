    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will create a truth table with three columns: A, B, and C. We will assign each statement a numerical value (1 = true, 0 = false) and use the truth table to determine the validity of the argument.\n\nHere is the truth table:\n\n| A | B | C |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. A is relevant to B\n2. B is relevant to C\n\nWe need to find out if A is relevant to C. In relevance logic, a statement is relevant to another if the truth value of one statement affects the truth value of the other.\n\nLooking at the truth table, we can see that:\n\n1. When A is true (1), B can be either true (1) or false (0).\n2. When B is true (1), C can be either true (1) or false (0).\n\nNow, let's see if A is relevant to C:\n\n- When A is true (1), B can be either true (1) or false (0).\n- When B is true (1), C can be either true (1) or false (0).\n- When B is false (0), C can be either true (1) or false (0).\n\nSo, when A is true (1), C can be either true (1) or false (0). Similarly, when A is false (0), C can be either true (1) or false (0). This means that the truth value of A does not affect the truth value of C.\n\nTherefore, based on the truth table, A is not relevant to C."
