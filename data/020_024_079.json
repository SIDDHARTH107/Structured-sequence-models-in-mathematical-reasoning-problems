    "message_1": "A company produces and sells headphones at a cost of $20 per unit. The demand function for their headphones is given as P = 100 - Q, where P is the price per unit and Q is the quantity sold. Determine the optimal price that the company should charge to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we first need to find the revenue function, which is the product of the price per unit (P) and the quantity sold (Q). Then, we'll subtract the cost function to find the profit function. Finally, we'll find the critical points of the profit function and determine the optimal price.\n\n1. Revenue function: R(Q) = P * Q = (100 - Q) * Q = 100Q - Q^2\n2. Cost function: C(Q) = 20Q\n3. Profit function: π(Q) = R(Q) - C(Q) = 100Q - Q^2 - 20Q = 80Q - Q^2\n\nNow, we'll find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n\nπ'(Q) = 80 - 2Q\n80 - 2Q = 0\n2Q = 80\nQ = 40\n\nThe critical point occurs at Q = 40. To ensure that this is a maximum, we'll take the second derivative of the profit function and check its sign at Q = 40.\n\nπ''(Q) = -2\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point at Q = 40 is indeed a maximum. Now, we'll plug this value back into the demand function to find the optimal price.\n\nP = 100 - Q\nP = 100 - 40\nP = 60\n\nThe optimal price that the company should charge to maximize their profit is $60 per unit."
