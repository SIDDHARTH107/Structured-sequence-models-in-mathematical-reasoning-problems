    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a math student to solve related to Heat transfer and diffusion equations:\n\n\"Consider a metal rod of length 1 meter with thermal diffusivity 0.1 m²/s, initially at a temperature of 100°C. At time t=0, it is suddenly immersed in a large volume of water at 20°C. Using the diffusion equation for heat transfer, determine the temperature distribution within the metal rod at time t=10 seconds. Assume the boundary conditions that the temperature at the ends of the rod remain at 100°C throughout the heating process.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, also known as the diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity (0.1 m²/s in this case).\n\nSince the ends of the rod are held at a constant temperature of 100°C, we have the following boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = 100°C\nT(1, t) = 100°C\n\nThe initial condition is that the rod is at a uniform temperature of 100°C:\n\nT(x, 0) = 100°C\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) dT(t)/dt = -αλT(t)\n2) d²X(x)/dx² = -λX(x)\n\nThe general solution to equation 2 is:\n\nX(x) = A cos(√λx) + B sin(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A cos(0) + B sin(0) = 100\nX(1) = A cos(√λ) + B sin(√λ) = 100\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, we have A = 100. Now we need to find λ and B such that X(1) = 100. This is an eigenvalue problem, and the solutions are given by:\n\nλ_n = (nπ)²\nB_n = 0\n\nSo the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX_n(x) = 100 cos(nπx)\n\nNow we solve equation 1:\n\ndT(t)/dt = -αλ_nT(t)\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n exp(-αλ_nt)\n\nThe overall solution is given by a sum of these solutions:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [100 cos(nπx) C_n exp(-α(nπ)²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 100:\n\n100 = Σ [100 cos(nπx) C_n]\n\nSince the initial condition is independent of x, we have:\n\nC_n = 1\n\nSo the final solution is:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [100 cos(nπx) exp(-α(nπ)²t)]\n\nNow we can find the temperature distribution at t = 10 seconds:\n\nT(x, 10) = Σ [100 cos(nπx) exp(-0.1(nπ)²*10)]\n\nThis is an infinite series, but we can approximate the solution by taking the first few terms. For example, taking the first 5 terms:\n\nT(x, 10) ≈ 100 cos(πx) exp(-π²) + 100 cos(2πx) exp(-4π²) + 100 cos(3πx) exp(-9π²) + 100 cos(4πx) exp(-16π²) + 100 cos(5πx) exp(-25π²)\n\nThis gives the approximate temperature distribution within the metal rod at time t = 10 seconds."
