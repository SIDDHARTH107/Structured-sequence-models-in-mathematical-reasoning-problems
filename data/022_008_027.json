    "message_2": "To find the roots of the function $f(z) = z^3 - 4z + 1$, we need to solve the equation $z^3 - 4z + 1 = 0$. \n\nFirst, we can look for any real roots by using the Rational Root Theorem. The only possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$. Testing these values, we find that neither of them are roots. \n\nNext, we can use numerical methods to approximate the roots. One such method is the Newton-Raphson method. The derivative of $f(z)$ is $f'(z) = 3z^2 - 4$. The Newton-Raphson iteration formula is:\n\n$z_{n+1} = z_n - \\frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)}$\n\nStarting with an initial guess $z_0 = 1$, we can iterate the formula to find an approximation of the first root:\n\n$z_1 = 1 - \\frac{f(1)}{f'(1)} = 1 - \\frac{-2}{-1} = -1$\n\n$z_2 = -1 - \\frac{f(-1)}{f'(-1)} = -1 - \\frac{6}{7} \\approx -1.857$\n\n$z_3 \\approx -1.857 - \\frac{f(-1.857)}{f'(-1.857)} \\approx -1.928$\n\nContinuing the iterations, we find that the first root converges to $z_1 \\approx -1.928$.\n\nNow, we can use synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n$(z^3 - 4z + 1) \\div (z - (-1.928)) \\approx (z + 1.928)(z^2 - 0.072z - 0.520)$\n\nWe can now solve the quadratic equation $z^2 - 0.072z - 0.520 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n\n$z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{0.072 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.072)^2 - 4(-0.520)}}{2}$\n\nSolving for the two remaining roots, we get:\n\n$z_2 \\approx 0.036 + 0.823i$\n\n$z_3 \\approx 0.036 - 0.823i$\n\nSo, the roots of the function $f(z) = z^3 - 4z + 1$ in the complex plane are approximately:\n\n$z_1 \\approx -1.928$\n\n$z_2 \\approx 0.036 + 0.823i$\n\n$z_3 \\approx 0.036 - 0.823i$"
