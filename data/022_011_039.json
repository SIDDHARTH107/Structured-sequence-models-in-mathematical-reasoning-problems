    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to solve the equation f(z) = 0, which means we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is zero:\n\nz^3 + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and we can rewrite it as:\n\nz^3 = -4\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\nz = ∛(-4)\n\nThere are three cube roots of -4 in the complex plane:\n\n1. z = -∛(4) (real root)\n2. z = ∛(4) * (cos(120°) + i * sin(120°)) (complex root)\n3. z = ∛(4) * (cos(240°) + i * sin(240°)) (complex root)\n\nSo, the zeros of the function are:\n\nz1 = -∛(4)\nz2 = ∛(4) * (cos(120°) + i * sin(120°))\nz3 = ∛(4) * (cos(240°) + i * sin(240°))\n\nAll zeros have order 1 since they are simple roots of the cubic equation.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can factor it as:\n\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nSo, the poles of the function are:\n\nz4 = 1\nz5 = -1\n\nBoth poles have order 1 since they are simple roots of the quadratic equation.\n\nIn summary, the zeros and poles of the function f(z) = (z^3 + 4)/(z^2 -1) are:\n\nZeros:\nz1 = -∛(4) (order 1)\nz2 = ∛(4) * (cos(120°) + i * sin(120°)) (order 1)\nz3 = ∛(4) * (cos(240°) + i * sin(240°)) (order 1)\n\nPoles:\nz4 = 1 (order 1)\nz5 = -1 (order 1)"
