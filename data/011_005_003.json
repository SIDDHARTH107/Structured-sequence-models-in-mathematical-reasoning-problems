    "message_1": "Suppose you have 8 different books on a shelf, and you want to arrange 2 books on your table. What is the total number of possible arrangements?",
    "message_2": "This is a permutation problem since the order of the books matters. You have 8 different books to choose from for the first book on the table, and then 7 remaining books to choose from for the second book on the table. \n\nThe total number of possible arrangements can be calculated using the formula for permutations:\n\nnPr = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 8 books), r is the number of items to be arranged (in this case, 2 books), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n8P2 = 8! / (8 - 2)!\n\n8P2 = 8! / 6!\n\nTo calculate the factorials:\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nNow, divide 8! by 6!:\n\n8P2 = 40,320 / 720 = 56\n\nThere are 56 possible arrangements of the 2 books on the table."
