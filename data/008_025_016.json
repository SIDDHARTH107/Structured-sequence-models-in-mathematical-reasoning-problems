    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n\nThis is the same as the first equation. So, we can eliminate the second equation since it doesn't provide any new information.\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n-5x - 3y = 20\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. We can multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y the same:\n\n15x + 10y = 35\n-15x - 9y = 60\n\nNow, we can add the two equations to eliminate x:\n\n15x + 10y = 35\n-15x - 9y = 60\n----------------\ny = 95\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n3x + 2(95) = 7\n3x + 190 = 7\n\nNow, subtract 190 from both sides:\n\n3x = -183\n\nNow, divide by 3:\n\nx = -61\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -61 and y = 95."
