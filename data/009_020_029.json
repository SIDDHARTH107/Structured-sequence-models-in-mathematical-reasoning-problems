The input u(t) is limited to -1 ≤ u(t) ≤ 1. \n\nFind the optimal control input u(t) that maximizes the output y(T) at time T = 5 subject to the given constraints.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control input u(t) that maximizes the output y(T) at time T = 5, we can use the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. This principle states that the optimal control input u(t) should minimize the Hamiltonian function H, which is defined as:\n\nH = λ'(t) * (y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t) - u(t))\n\nwhere λ(t) is the costate variable (also known as the adjoint variable).\n\nThe necessary conditions for the optimal control are:\n\n1. State equation: y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t) = u(t)\n2. Costate equation: λ'(t) = -∂H/∂y = -λ''(t) - λ'(t)\n3. Transversality condition: λ(T) = 0\n4. Hamiltonian minimization: ∂H/∂u = -λ'(t) = 0\n\nFrom the Hamiltonian minimization condition, we have λ'(t) = 0. Now, we can solve the costate equation:\n\nλ''(t) + λ'(t) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order homogeneous linear differential equation, and its general solution is:\n\nλ(t) = A * e^(-t) + B * t * e^(-t)\n\nwhere A and B are constants. Applying the transversality condition λ(T) = 0, we get:\n\n0 = A * e^(-5) + B * 5 * e^(-5)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B. Since we don't have any other boundary conditions for λ(t), we can't uniquely determine A and B. However, we can still find the structure of the optimal control input u(t) by analyzing the Hamiltonian function.\n\nSince λ'(t) = 0, the Hamiltonian function becomes:\n\nH = λ'(t) * (y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t) - u(t)) = 0\n\nThis implies that:\n\nu(t) = y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t)\n\nNow, we need to consider the constraints on u(t): -1 ≤ u(t) ≤ 1. If y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t) is within this range, then the optimal control input is:\n\nu(t) = y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t)\n\nIf y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t) > 1, then the optimal control input is:\n\nu(t) = 1\n\nIf y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t) < -1, then the optimal control input is:\n\nu(t) = -1\n\nIn summary, the optimal control input u(t) that maximizes the output y(T) at time T = 5 is given by:\n\nu(t) = min(max(y''(t) + y'(t) + y(t), -1), 1)"
