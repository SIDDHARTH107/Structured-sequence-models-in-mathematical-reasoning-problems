    "message_2": "Let's consider the 2 people who insist on standing together as a single unit. Now, we have 4 units to arrange: the pair and the other 3 individuals. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange these 4 units.\n\nNow, within the pair, there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the 2 people.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the 5 people with the constraint that the 2 people stand together is:\n\n4! × 2! = 24 × 2 = 48 ways."
