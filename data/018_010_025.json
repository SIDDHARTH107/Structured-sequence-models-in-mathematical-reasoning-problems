We want to show that A x (B ∪ C) = (A x B) ∪ (A x C) for any sets A, B, and C.\n\nProof:\n\nLet (a, d) be an arbitrary element in A x (B ∪ C). Then, by definition of Cartesian product, a ∈ A and d ∈ (B ∪ C). Since d ∈ (B ∪ C), either d ∈ B or d ∈ C.\n\nCase 1: d ∈ B\nThen, (a, d) ∈ A x B. Therefore, (a, d) ∈ (A x B) ∪ (A x C).\n\nCase 2: d ∈ C\nThen, (a, d) ∈ A x C. Therefore, (a, d) ∈ (A x B) ∪ (A x C).\n\nIn both cases, (a, d) ∈ (A x B) ∪ (A x C). So, A x (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A x B) ∪ (A x C).\n\nNow, let (a, d) be an arbitrary element in (A x B) ∪ (A x C). Then, either (a, d) ∈ A x B or (a, d) ∈ A x C.\n\nCase 1: (a, d) ∈ A x B\nThen, a ∈ A and d ∈ B. Therefore, d ∈ (B ∪ C) and (a, d) ∈ A x (B ∪ C).\n\nCase 2: (a, d) ∈ A x C\nThen, a ∈ A and d ∈ C. Therefore, d ∈ (B ∪ C) and (a, d) ∈ A x (B ∪ C).\n\nIn both cases, (a, d) ∈ A x (B ∪ C). So, (A x B) ∪ (A x C) ⊆ A x (B ∪ C).\n\nSince A x (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A x B) ∪ (A x C) and (A x B) ∪ (A x C) ⊆ A x (B ∪ C), we can conclude that A x (B ∪ C) = (A x B) ∪ (A x C). This proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over union."
