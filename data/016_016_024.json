    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using a recursive process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of (7/3). \n\nTo find the total length of the Gosper curve after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (Length Increase Factor) ^ Number of Iterations\n\nLength = 1 * (7/3)^5\n\nLength ≈ 1 * 16807/243\n\nLength ≈ 69.1329\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 5 iterations is approximately 69.1329 units."
