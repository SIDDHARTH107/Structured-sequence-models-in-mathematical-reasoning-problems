    "message_2": "To graph the function f(x) = 2 sin(3x) - 1, we first need to find the amplitude, period, and x-intercepts.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is found by dividing 2π by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the period is 2π / 3.\n\nX-intercepts:\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to find the values of x for which f(x) = 0.\n\n0 = 2 sin(3x) - 1\n1 = 2 sin(3x)\nsin(3x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that satisfy this equation. The sine function is equal to 1/2 at π/6 and 5π/6 in the interval [0, 2π]. However, since the period of our function is 2π/3, we need to consider the interval [0, 2π/3] for x.\n\n3x = π/6 or 3x = 5π/6\n\nFor the first case:\nx = π/18\n\nFor the second case:\nx = 5π/18\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = π/18 and x = 5π/18.\n\nIn summary:\nAmplitude: 2\nPeriod: 2π/3\nX-intercepts: x = π/18 and x = 5π/18\n\nTo graph the function, start by plotting the x-intercepts. Then, sketch the sine wave with an amplitude of 2 and a period of 2π/3, making sure the wave passes through the x-intercepts. Finally, shift the entire graph down by 1 unit to account for the -1 term in the function."
