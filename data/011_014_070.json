    "message_1": "Consider a simple undirected graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges. How many possible paths are there between vertex 1 and vertex 4 which have exactly 3 edges?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the vertices as V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7. We want to find the number of paths between V1 and V4 with exactly 3 edges.\n\nSince the graph is undirected, we can represent the graph using an adjacency matrix A, where A[i][j] = 1 if there is an edge between vertices i and j, and A[i][j] = 0 otherwise.\n\nTo find the number of paths with exactly 3 edges between V1 and V4, we need to compute the (1, 4) entry of the matrix A^3 (A cubed). This is because the (i, j) entry of A^n represents the number of paths with exactly n edges between vertices i and j.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information about the graph to compute A^3 directly. We can only provide a general approach to solve the problem if the adjacency matrix A were given.\n\nHere's the general approach:\n\n1. Compute the matrix A^2 by multiplying A with itself.\n2. Compute the matrix A^3 by multiplying A^2 with A.\n3. The number of paths with exactly 3 edges between V1 and V4 is the (1, 4) entry of the matrix A^3.\n\nWithout more information about the graph, we cannot provide a specific answer to the problem."
