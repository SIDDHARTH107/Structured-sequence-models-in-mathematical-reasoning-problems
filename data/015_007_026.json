    "message_1": "What is the next value of x in the period-doubling sequence generated by the logistic map with parameter r=3.4 and initial value x0=0.5? \n\nTo solve this, the student will need to iterate the logistic map function using x0 and r to derive the next value of x in the sequence.",
    "message_2": "The logistic map function is given by the equation:\n\nx_n+1 = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the current value of x, x_n+1 is the next value of x, and r is the parameter.\n\nGiven r = 3.4 and x0 = 0.5, we can find the next value of x in the sequence by plugging these values into the equation:\n\nx1 = 3.4 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)\n\nx1 = 3.4 * 0.5 * 0.5\n\nx1 = 0.85\n\nSo, the next value of x in the period-doubling sequence is x1 = 0.85."
