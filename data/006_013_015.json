    "message_1": "A region has experienced a flood once every 5 years on average. What is the probability that the region will experience at least one flood in the next 2 years? Assume that flood frequency follows a Poisson distribution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, floods) happening in a fixed interval of time (in this case, 2 years) given a constant average rate of occurrence (in this case, 1 flood every 5 years).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events in the given time interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of occurrence (average number of events per time interval)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to find the average rate of occurrence (λ) for the 2-year period. Since the region experiences a flood once every 5 years on average, the rate for 2 years would be:\n\nλ = (1 flood / 5 years) * 2 years = 2/5 = 0.4 floods\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of experiencing at least one flood in the next 2 years. To do this, we can find the probability of experiencing no floods and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of experiencing no floods (k = 0) in the next 2 years:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.4) * 0.4^0) / 0! = (e^(-0.4) * 1) / 1 = e^(-0.4)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of experiencing at least one flood:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-0.4)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 0.67032 ≈ 0.32968\n\nSo, the probability that the region will experience at least one flood in the next 2 years is approximately 32.97%."
