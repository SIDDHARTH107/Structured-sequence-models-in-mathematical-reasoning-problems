    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the cable used to form the circle, and let y be the length of the cable used to form the square. We know that x + y = 20.\n\nThe circumference of the circle is x, so the radius of the circle is r = x / (2 * pi). The area of the circle is A_c = pi * r^2 = pi * (x / (2 * pi))^2 = (x^2) / (4 * pi).\n\nThe perimeter of the square is y, so the side length of the square is s = y / 4. The area of the square is A_s = s^2 = (y / 4)^2 = y^2 / 16.\n\nThe total area enclosed by the two shapes is A_total = A_c + A_s = (x^2) / (4 * pi) + y^2 / 16.\n\nTo maximize the total area, we can use calculus. First, we need to express y in terms of x using the constraint x + y = 20. We get y = 20 - x.\n\nNow, we can rewrite A_total in terms of x only:\n\nA_total(x) = (x^2) / (4 * pi) + (20 - x)^2 / 16.\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of A_total with respect to x and setting it to 0:\n\ndA_total/dx = (2 * x) / (4 * pi) - 2 * (20 - x) / 16 = x / (2 * pi) - (20 - x) / 8.\n\nSetting the derivative to 0:\n\n0 = x / (2 * pi) - (20 - x) / 8.\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx / (2 * pi) = (20 - x) / 8.\n8 * x = 20 * (2 * pi) - 2 * pi * x.\n8 * x + 2 * pi * x = 20 * (2 * pi).\nx * (8 + 2 * pi) = 40 * pi.\nx = (40 * pi) / (8 + 2 * pi).\n\nNow, we can find the value of y:\n\ny = 20 - x = 20 - (40 * pi) / (8 + 2 * pi).\n\nNow we can find the dimensions of the circle and the square:\n\nRadius of the circle, r = x / (2 * pi) = ((40 * pi) / (8 + 2 * pi)) / (2 * pi) = 20 / (8 + 2 * pi).\nSide length of the square, s = y / 4 = (20 - (40 * pi) / (8 + 2 * pi)) / 4.\n\nSo, the dimensions that maximize the total area enclosed by the two shapes are:\n\nCircle: radius ≈ 20 / (8 + 2 * pi) ≈ 1.77 meters.\nSquare: side length ≈ (20 - (40 * pi) / (8 + 2 * pi)) / 4 ≈ 3.54 meters."
