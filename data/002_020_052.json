    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm and the central angle (θ) is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2 × 3.14159 × 8\nL = (1/6) × 2 × 3.14159 × 8\nL ≈ 8.37758 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii (each 8 cm) to the length of the arc:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter ≈ 8.37758 + 2 × 8\nPerimeter ≈ 8.37758 + 16\nPerimeter ≈ 24.37758 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 24.38 cm."
