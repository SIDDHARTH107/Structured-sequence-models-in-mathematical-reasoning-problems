    "message_1": "A network consists of three resistors in a series connection, with values of 10, 20, and 30 Ohms respectively. Using Fourier analysis, find the frequency response of this network.",
    "message_2": "Fourier analysis is not applicable to a simple resistive network like this one, as it is used to analyze the frequency response of systems with reactive components (capacitors and inductors) or non-linear components. Since this network only consists of resistors, the frequency response will be flat and constant across all frequencies.\n\nIn a series connection, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances:\n\nR_total = R1 + R2 + R3\nR_total = 10 Ω + 20 Ω + 30 Ω\nR_total = 60 Ω\n\nThe frequency response of this network is constant at 60 Ω for all frequencies."
