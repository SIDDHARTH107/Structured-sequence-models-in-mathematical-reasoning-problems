    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 6 cm and a slant height of 10 cm. Determine the surface area of the cone.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (curved part) and then add them together.\n\n1. Base area (A_base): A_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (6 cm)^2\nA_base = 36π cm^2\n\n2. Lateral surface area (A_lateral): A_lateral = π * r * l\nA_lateral = π * (6 cm) * (10 cm)\nA_lateral = 60π cm^2\n\nNow, let's add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cone.\n\nSurface area (A_total) = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 36π cm^2 + 60π cm^2\nA_total = 96π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 96π cm^2."
