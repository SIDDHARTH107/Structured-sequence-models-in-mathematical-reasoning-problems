    "message_1": "In a market, it is known that 30% of consumers prefer to buy products on sale. If a store wants to attract at least 500 customers who prefer to buy products on sale, what is the minimum number of customers they should target to attract, assuming that the market size is 10,000 customers? Use probability to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the minimum number of customers the store should target to attract at least 500 customers who prefer to buy products on sale. Since 30% of consumers prefer to buy products on sale, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.30 * x >= 500\n\nNow, we'll solve for x:\n\nx >= 500 / 0.30\nx >= 1666.67\n\nSince the store cannot target a fraction of a customer, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nx >= 1667\n\nSo, the store should target at least 1667 customers to attract at least 500 customers who prefer to buy products on sale."
