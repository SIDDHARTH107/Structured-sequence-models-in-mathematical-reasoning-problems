    "message_2": "Let's consider a group G of order 25. Since 25 is a prime power (25 = 5^2), we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, which states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nIn our case, G is an abelian group of order 5^2, so it must be isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n1. A direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5: C_5 × C_5\n2. A cyclic group of order 25: C_25\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these possibilities is true for G.\n\nLet's consider the number of elements of order 5 in G. By the Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element of order 5 in G. Let's denote this element as x. Then, the subgroup generated by x, <x>, is a cyclic group of order 5. Since the order of G is 25, there must be another element y in G that is not in <x>. The order of y must be a divisor of 25, so it can be either 1, 5, or 25. If the order of y is 1, then y is the identity element, which is already in <x>. If the order of y is 25, then G is cyclic, generated by y. The only remaining possibility is that the order of y is 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup generated by y, <y>. Since the order of <y> is 5 and the order of <x> is 5, and both are prime, <x> and <y> must be disjoint except for the identity element. Therefore, the product of their orders, |<x>| * |<y>| = 5 * 5 = 25, is equal to the order of G.\n\nSince the orders of <x> and <y> are coprime, their intersection is trivial (i.e., it contains only the identity element), and their product is equal to the order of G, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5: G ≅ C_5 × C_5."
