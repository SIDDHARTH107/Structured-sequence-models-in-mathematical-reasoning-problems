    "message_1": "Solve the following system of linear equations with multiple solutions:\n\nx + y + z = 6\n2x + 2y + 2z = 12\n3x + 3y + 3z = 18\n\nWhat are the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the above system of equations?",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that all three equations are multiples of each other. Let's divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\nx + y + z = 6\nx + y + z = 6\nx + y + z = 6\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, and we cannot find a unique solution for x, y, and z. However, we can express one of the variables in terms of the others.\n\nLet's express z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = 6 - x - y\n\nNow, any values of x and y that satisfy this equation will also satisfy the original system of equations."
