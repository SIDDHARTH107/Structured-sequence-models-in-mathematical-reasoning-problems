    "message_1": "Let A = {2, 3, 4} and B = {5, 6, 7}. Find the Cartesian product A x B and B x A, and show that the two sets are not equal, thus proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product A x B, we take each element of set A and pair it with each element of set B. The Cartesian product A x B is given by:\n\nA x B = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product B x A, where we take each element of set B and pair it with each element of set A:\n\nB x A = {(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)}\nB x A = {(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)}\n\nWe can see that the two sets are not equal, as the ordered pairs in each set are different. For example, (2, 5) is in A x B, but not in B x A, and (5, 2) is in B x A, but not in A x B. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
