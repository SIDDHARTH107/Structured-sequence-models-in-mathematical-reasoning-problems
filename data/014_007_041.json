    "message_1": "Consider a stream cipher that uses a key stream generated by XORing the output of two linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) of lengths 5 and 7 respectively. Assuming that the initial states of the LFSRs are non-zero and unknown, determine the period of the resulting key stream.",
    "message_2": "To determine the period of the resulting key stream, we first need to find the periods of the individual LFSRs.\n\nFor an LFSR of length n, the maximum period is 2^n - 1, which is achieved when the feedback polynomial is primitive. In this case, we have two LFSRs with lengths 5 and 7.\n\nFor the LFSR of length 5, the maximum period is 2^5 - 1 = 31.\nFor the LFSR of length 7, the maximum period is 2^7 - 1 = 127.\n\nNow, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the two LFSRs, as this will give us the period of the resulting key stream when XORing their outputs.\n\nLCM(31, 127) = 31 * 127 = 3937\n\nTherefore, the period of the resulting key stream is 3937."
