    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 4x^2 + 12x + 8\nFactor out the greatest common factor (GCF) which is 4:\n4(x^2 + 3x + 2)\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n4(x + 1)(x + 2)\n\nDenominator: 2x^2 + 10x\nFactor out the GCF which is 2x:\n2x(x + 5)\n\nNow, the rational expression looks like this:\n(4(x + 1)(x + 2)) / (2x(x + 5))\n\nWe can simplify further by canceling out the common factors:\n\n(2 * 2(x + 1)(x + 2)) / (2x(x + 5))\n\nAfter canceling out the common factor of 2:\n\n(2(x + 1)(x + 2)) / (x(x + 5))\n\nThe simplified rational expression is:\n\n(2(x + 1)(x + 2)) / (x(x + 5))"
