    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 5 cm and 7 cm, and the included angle between them is 60 degrees. Find the perimeter of the triangle using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and angle C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\n60 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = (5 cm)² + (7 cm)² - 2(5 cm)(7 cm) * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 25 cm² + 49 cm² - 70 cm² * (1/2)\nc² = 74 cm² - 35 cm²\nc² = 39 cm²\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √(39 cm²)\nc ≈ 6.24 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 5 cm + 7 cm + 6.24 cm\nPerimeter ≈ 18.24 cm"
