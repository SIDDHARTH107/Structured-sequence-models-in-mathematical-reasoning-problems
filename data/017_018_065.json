    "message_2": "From the given information, there are three types of groups of order 32: the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, and six non-abelian groups. Since each of these groups is non-isomorphic, we can simply count the number of groups in each category:\n\n1. Cyclic group C32: 1 group\n2. Dihedral group D16: 1 group\n3. Six non-abelian groups: 6 groups\n\nAdding these together, there are a total of 1 + 1 + 6 = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
