    "message_2": "First, let's find the dot product of the vectors when the angle between them is 60 degrees. The dot product of two vectors can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere A and B are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, |A| = 4, |B| = 5, and θ = 60 degrees. We can convert the angle to radians by multiplying by π/180:\n\nθ = 60 * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the dot product:\n\nA · B = 4 * 5 * cos(π/3) = 20 * (1/2) = 10\n\nSo, the dot product of the vectors when the angle between them is 60 degrees is 10.\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the vectors when the dot product is -10. We can use the same formula, but this time we'll solve for θ:\n\n-10 = 4 * 5 * cos(θ)\n\n-10 = 20 * cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = -1/2\n\nTo find the angle θ, we can take the inverse cosine (arccos) of -1/2:\n\nθ = arccos(-1/2)\n\nθ ≈ 2π/3 radians\n\nTo convert back to degrees, multiply by 180/π:\n\nθ ≈ (2π/3) * (180/π) = 120 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the vectors when the dot product is -10 is approximately 120 degrees."
