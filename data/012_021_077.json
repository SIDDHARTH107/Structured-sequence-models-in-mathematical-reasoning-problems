    "message_2": "To compute the treewidth of the given graph, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the original graph, and it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the original graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the original graph, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the original graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nA possible tree decomposition for the given graph is:\n\n```\n  {A, B, C}\n   |     |\n  {B, D, E}   {C, E, F}\n   |     |     |     |\n  {B, E, G}   {E, H, I}   {C, F, I}\n```\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of its largest bag minus one. In this case, the largest bag has 3 vertices, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
