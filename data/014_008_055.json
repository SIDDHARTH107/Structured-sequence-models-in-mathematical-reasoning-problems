    "message_1": "Using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and a symmetric key of 256 bits, encrypt the plaintext \"010101110110111101110101\" (in binary) to obtain the ciphertext using the Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode of operation.",
    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform the actual encryption process. However, I can guide you through the steps to perform AES-256 encryption with ECB mode on the given plaintext.\n\n1. Convert the binary plaintext to hexadecimal: The given binary plaintext is \"010101110110111101110101\". Convert this to hexadecimal: 57 6D 75.\n\n2. Pad the plaintext: Since AES operates on 128-bit blocks, you need to pad the plaintext to make it 128 bits long. You can use PKCS#7 padding, which involves adding bytes with the same value as the number of padding bytes. In this case, you need to add 13 bytes (104 bits) of padding, so the padded plaintext becomes: 57 6D 75 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D 0D.\n\n3. Generate a 256-bit key: You need a 256-bit key for AES-256 encryption. This key should be securely generated and kept secret. For example, you can use a random key like: 3A 1F 5C 47 09 8B 6C 3D 4A 5F 7C 8D 9E 0B 2C 3D 4E 5F 7C 8D 9E 0B 2C 3D 4E 5F 7C 8D 9E 0B 2C.\n\n4. Perform AES-256 encryption: Use a cryptographic library or tool that supports AES-256 encryption with ECB mode to encrypt the padded plaintext using the generated key. For example, you can use OpenSSL, Crypto++, or a programming language's built-in cryptographic library.\n\n5. Obtain the ciphertext: After the encryption process, you will get the ciphertext in hexadecimal format. Due to the nature of encryption, I cannot provide the exact ciphertext without performing the encryption myself.\n\nRemember that ECB mode is generally not recommended for use in real-world applications, as it can reveal patterns in the plaintext. Instead, consider using a more secure mode like Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)."
