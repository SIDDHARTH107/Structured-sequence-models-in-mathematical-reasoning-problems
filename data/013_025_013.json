    "message_1": "Suppose two airlines, A and B, are involved in a game where each must simultaneously choose a baggage fee for their passengers. The baggage fee can be any number between $50 and $100. If both airlines charge the same baggage fee, they split the total revenue evenly. If they charge different fees, the airline with the lower fee keeps all the revenue. However, if both airlines charge the lowest possible fee ($50), they both incur a $100 penalty. \n\nUsing Nash equilibrium and the concept of dominant strategies, what is the best fee for each airline to charge?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the strategies of both airlines and determine the best response for each airline given the other's choice. Let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If airline A charges $50 and airline B charges any fee above $50, airline A will get all the revenue. However, airline A will also incur a $100 penalty, so it's not a profitable strategy for airline A.\n\n2. If both airlines charge the same fee above $50, they will split the revenue evenly. In this case, both airlines would prefer to charge a higher fee to maximize their revenue share.\n\n3. If airline A charges a fee above $50 and airline B charges a lower fee, airline B will get all the revenue. In this case, airline A would prefer to lower its fee to match airline B's fee or charge a slightly lower fee to get all the revenue.\n\nGiven these scenarios, there is no dominant strategy for either airline. However, we can find a Nash equilibrium by considering the best response for each airline given the other's choice.\n\nIf airline A charges $99, the best response for airline B is to charge $98, as it will get all the revenue. If airline B charges $98, the best response for airline A is to charge $97. This pattern continues until both airlines charge $50, at which point they both incur a $100 penalty.\n\nTo avoid the penalty, both airlines would prefer to charge a fee slightly above $50. In this case, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both airlines charge a fee infinitesimally above $50 (e.g., $50.01). At this equilibrium, neither airline has an incentive to change its strategy, as charging a lower fee would result in a penalty, and charging a higher fee would result in losing all the revenue to the other airline."
