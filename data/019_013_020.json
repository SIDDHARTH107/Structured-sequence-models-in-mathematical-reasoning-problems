    "message_2": "Let's assign x = 0 and y = 0. Now let's check if the given second-order sentence is true for these values.\n\n\"For every set S of natural numbers, if there exists an element z in S such that x is greater than or equal to z, then there exists a natural number t in S such that y is greater than or equal to t plus x\"\n\nSince x = 0, the condition \"x is greater than or equal to z\" will always be true for any z in S, as 0 is the smallest natural number. Now we need to check if there exists a natural number t in S such that y is greater than or equal to t plus x.\n\nSince y = 0 and x = 0, we need to find a t in S such that 0 is greater than or equal to t. Since 0 is the smallest natural number and is always in S, we can choose t = 0, and the condition \"y is greater than or equal to t plus x\" will be true.\n\nTherefore, the assignment x = 0 and y = 0 makes the given second-order sentence true."
