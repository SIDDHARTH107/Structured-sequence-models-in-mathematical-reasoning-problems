    "message_2": "The minimum size of the vertex cover for the given graph can be found using the greedy algorithm or by inspection. In this case, we can find the vertex cover by inspection:\n\nOne possible minimum vertex cover is {B, C, D, F}. This set of vertices covers all the edges in the graph, and no smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges. Therefore, the minimum size of the vertex cover is 4."
