    "message_1": "Suppose 3 bidders participate in a first-price sealed-bid auction where the item being auctioned has a common value of $100. The bidders have the following private valuations (in dollars): Bidder 1: $90, Bidder 2: $110, Bidder 3: $105. What is the expected revenue of the auctioneer?",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, each bidder submits a bid without knowing the bids of the other participants, and the highest bidder wins the auction, paying the amount of their bid.\n\nGiven the private valuations of the bidders, we can assume that each bidder will bid a value less than or equal to their private valuation to maximize their profit. Since Bidder 2 has the highest private valuation, they are most likely to win the auction. However, they don't know the other bidders' valuations, so they will try to bid just enough to win without overpaying.\n\nIf Bidder 2 knows that Bidder 1's maximum bid is $90, they could bid slightly above $90 (let's say $90.01) to ensure they win the auction while maximizing their profit. Similarly, if Bidder 3 knows that Bidder 1's maximum bid is $90, they could also bid slightly above $90 (let's say $90.02) to try to win the auction. However, since Bidder 2 has a higher private valuation, they are more likely to win.\n\nIn this scenario, the expected revenue for the auctioneer would be the winning bid, which is $90.01 from Bidder 2."
