    "message_2": "To maximize the volume of the open-top box, we need to find the dimensions of the box that will give us the maximum volume. Let x be the side length of the congruent squares that will be cut from each corner of the rectangular cardboard.\n\nAfter cutting the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 24 - 2x\nWidth: 16 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be calculated as:\n\nV = length × width × height\nV = (24 - 2x)(16 - 2x)x\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nV = 4x^3 - 80x^2 + 384x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the volume equation with respect to x and setting it to 0:\n\ndV/dx = 12x^2 - 160x + 384\n\nSetting dV/dx = 0:\n\n12x^2 - 160x + 384 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 4:\n\n3x^2 - 40x + 96 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -40, and c = 96:\n\nx = (40 ± √((-40)² - 4(3)(96))) / (2(3))\nx = (40 ± √(1600 - 1152)) / 6\nx = (40 ± √448) / 6\nx ≈ 4.83, 6.67\n\nSince the width of the cardboard is 16 inches, x cannot be greater than half of the width (8 inches). Therefore, we discard the value x ≈ 6.67 and use x ≈ 4.83 inches.\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the box:\n\nLength: 24 - 2(4.83) ≈ 14.34 inches\nWidth: 16 - 2(4.83) ≈ 6.34 inches\nHeight: 4.83 inches\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will maximize its volume are approximately 14.34 inches by 6.34 inches by 4.83 inches."
