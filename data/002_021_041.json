    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (arc length × radius) / 2\n\nWe are given the arc length as 4 cm and the radius as 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (4 cm × 6 cm) / 2\nArea of sector = 24 cm² / 2\nArea of sector = 12 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the sector is 12 square centimeters."
