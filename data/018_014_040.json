    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the Cartesian products A × B and A' × B. \n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, we need to find the complements of sets A and B. Since no universal set is given, we cannot find the exact complements. However, we can still find the intersection of (A × B)' and (A' × B) without knowing the exact complements.\n\nLet's consider the intersection (A × B)' ∩ (A' × B). This intersection consists of elements that are NOT in A × B but are in A' × B. Since A' and B are disjoint from A and B respectively, any element in A' × B will not have elements from A and B. Therefore, there will be no common elements between A × B and A' × B.\n\nThus, the intersection (A × B)' ∩ (A' × B) is an empty set, denoted as ∅."
