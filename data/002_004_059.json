    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width. \n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 8 cm and the width (W) is 5 cm. \n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nP = 2(8) + 2(5)\nP = 16 + 10\nP = 26 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 26 centimeters."
