    "message_2": "The given signal f(t) = 4cos(2πt) + 2sin(6πt) is already in the time domain with the frequency components explicitly given. We don't need to use the Fourier transform to find the frequency components and their respective amplitudes in this case.\n\nThe signal f(t) consists of two components:\n\n1. A cosine function with amplitude 4 and angular frequency 2π: 4cos(2πt)\n2. A sine function with amplitude 2 and angular frequency 6π: 2sin(6πt)\n\nTo find the frequency components, we can divide the angular frequency by 2π:\n\n1. Frequency component for the cosine function: (2π) / (2π) = 1 Hz\n2. Frequency component for the sine function: (6π) / (2π) = 3 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency components of the signal are 1 Hz and 3 Hz, with respective amplitudes of 4 and 2."
