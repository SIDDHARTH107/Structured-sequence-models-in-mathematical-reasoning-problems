    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nThe antiderivative F(x) is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x^2 - 4x + 5) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x^2) dx - ∫(4x) dx + ∫(5) dx\n\nNow, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), where n is a constant:\n\nF(x) = (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) - (4x^(1+1))/(1+1) + 5x + C\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nF(x) = (3x^3)/3 - (4x^2)/2 + 5x + C\n\nF(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 is F(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + C, where C is the constant of integration."
