    "message_2": "A function is considered smooth if it has continuous derivatives of all orders on the given interval. To check if the function f(x) = x^(4/3) - x^(2/3) is smooth on the interval [0,1], we will first find its derivative.\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^(4/3) - x^(2/3))\nf'(x) = (4/3)x^(1/3) - (2/3)x^(-1/3)\n\nNow we need to check if f'(x) is continuous on the interval [0,1]. The function f'(x) is continuous everywhere except possibly at x = 0, since the term x^(-1/3) has a negative exponent. To check the continuity at x = 0, we can take the limit as x approaches 0:\n\nlim (x -> 0) [(4/3)x^(1/3) - (2/3)x^(-1/3)]\n\nUsing L'Hopital's rule, we differentiate the numerator and denominator with respect to x:\n\nlim (x -> 0) [(4/9)x^(-2/3) - (-2/9)x^(-4/3)] / 1\n\nNow, as x approaches 0, both terms in the limit go to 0, so the limit exists and is equal to 0. Therefore, f'(x) is continuous on the interval [0,1].\n\nSince the first derivative f'(x) is continuous on the interval [0,1], the function f(x) = x^(4/3) - x^(2/3) is smooth on this interval. The derivative of the function is:\n\nf'(x) = (4/3)x^(1/3) - (2/3)x^(-1/3)"
