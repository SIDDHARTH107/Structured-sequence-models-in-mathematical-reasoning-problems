    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the mean weight of their cereal boxes is 15 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.5 ounces. A consumer advocacy group believes that the actual weight is less than this and randomly samples 36 boxes, finding an average weight of 14.8 ounces. Is there sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to support the consumer advocacy group's claim?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the consumer advocacy group's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean weight of the cereal boxes is equal to 15 ounces, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the mean weight is less than 15 ounces.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score using the following formula:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (14.8 - 15) / (0.5 / sqrt(36))\n\nt = (-0.2) / (0.5 / 6)\n\nt = -0.2 / 0.083333\n\nt = -2.4\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test at a 5% significance level with 35 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.69.\n\nSince our calculated t-score of -2.4 is less than the critical t-value of -1.69, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to support the consumer advocacy group's claim that the actual weight of the cereal boxes is less than 15 ounces."
