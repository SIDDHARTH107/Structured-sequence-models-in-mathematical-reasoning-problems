    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these outcomes, 3 are odd numbers: 1, 3, and 5. \n\nTo find the probability of rolling an odd number, divide the number of successful outcomes (rolling an odd number) by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 3 (odd numbers) / 6 (total outcomes)\n\nProbability = 1/2 or 0.5\n\nSo, the probability of rolling an odd number on a fair six-sided die is 1/2 or 50%."
