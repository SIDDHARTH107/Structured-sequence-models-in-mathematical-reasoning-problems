    "message_1": "A box of mass 10 kg is moved from point A to point B along a straight line by a force whose magnitude at a distance x meters from A is given by F(x) = (2x + 3) N. The distance between A and B is 5 m. Find the work done by the force.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = ∫F(x)dx from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nwhere F(x) = (2x + 3) N.\n\nNow, let's integrate F(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫(2x + 3)dx = x^2 + 3x + C\n\nNow, we need to find the work done from x = 0 to x = 5:\n\nWork = [x^2 + 3x] from 0 to 5\n\nFirst, let's find the value of the integral at x = 5:\n\n(5^2 + 3*5) = (25 + 15) = 40\n\nNow, let's find the value of the integral at x = 0:\n\n(0^2 + 3*0) = 0\n\nNow, subtract the value of the integral at x = 0 from the value at x = 5:\n\nWork = 40 - 0 = 40 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force to move the box from point A to point B is 40 Joules."
