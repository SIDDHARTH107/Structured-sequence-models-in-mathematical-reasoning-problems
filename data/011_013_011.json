    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinct colorings of an object is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry of the object. In the case of a cube, there are 24 possible rotations (symmetries).\n\n1. Identity rotation (1 rotation): All faces are unchanged. There are 3^6 colorings fixed by this rotation since each face can be any of the 3 colors.\n\n2. 90-degree rotations around an axis through the centers of opposite faces (6 rotations): There are 3 colorings fixed by each of these rotations, as the 4 faces around the axis must be the same color.\n\n3. 180-degree rotations around an axis through the centers of opposite faces (3 rotations): There are 3^2 = 9 colorings fixed by each of these rotations, as the pairs of opposite faces must be the same color.\n\n4. 120-degree and 240-degree rotations around an axis through opposite vertices (8 rotations): There are no colorings fixed by these rotations, as each face must have the same color as its two adjacent faces, which is impossible with 3 colors.\n\n5. 180-degree rotations around an axis through the midpoints of opposite edges (6 rotations): There are 3 colorings fixed by each of these rotations, as the pairs of opposite faces must be the same color, and the other two pairs of opposite faces must be the other two colors.\n\nNow, we apply Burnside's Lemma:\n\nNumber of distinct colorings = (1 * 3^6 + 6 * 3 + 3 * 9 + 8 * 0 + 6 * 3) / 24\n                                           = (729 + 18 + 27 + 0 + 18) / 24\n                                           = 792 / 24\n                                           = 33\n\nSo, there are 33 distinct ways to color the faces of a cube using red, blue, and green colors, considering rotations as equivalent."
