    "message_1": "A company manufactures two types of products: product A and product B. The company has a total of 500 hours of production time available per week and can produce product A in 4 hours and product B in 6 hours. The profit for each unit of product A is $50 and for each unit of product B is $70. Determine the maximum profit that the company can make per week if it sells all the products it produces.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe total production time constraint can be represented by the following inequality:\n4x + 6y ≤ 500\n\nThe profit function P(x, y) can be represented as:\nP(x, y) = 50x + 70y\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the maximum value of P(x, y) subject to the constraint 4x + 6y ≤ 500.\n\nFirst, we can try to express y in terms of x using the constraint:\ny ≤ (500 - 4x) / 6\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the profit function:\nP(x) = 50x + 70((500 - 4x) / 6)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\nP(x) = 50x + 5833.33 - 46.67x\n\nCombine the terms with x:\nP(x) = 3.33x + 5833.33\n\nSince the profit function is linear, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region defined by the constraint. We need to find the feasible region's vertices.\n\nThe constraint 4x + 6y ≤ 500 represents a line in the xy-plane. To find the vertices, we need to find the points where the line intersects the x and y axes.\n\nWhen x = 0:\n4(0) + 6y = 500\ny = 83.33\n\nWhen y = 0:\n4x + 6(0) = 500\nx = 125\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 83.33) and (125, 0).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the profit function at these vertices:\n\nP(0, 83.33) = 50(0) + 70(83.33) = $5833.10\nP(125, 0) = 50(125) + 70(0) = $6250\n\nSince P(125, 0) > P(0, 83.33), the maximum profit occurs when the company produces 125 units of product A and 0 units of product B.\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit that the company can make per week if it sells all the products it produces is $6250."
