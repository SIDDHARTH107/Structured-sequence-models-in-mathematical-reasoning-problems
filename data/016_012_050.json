    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that its length increases with each iteration. In each iteration, the curve is divided into 9 smaller copies of itself, and each copy is scaled down by a factor of 3. \n\nTo find the length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Original length * (9/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nLength = 1 * (9/3)^5\nLength = 1 * (3)^5\nLength = 1 * 243\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations is 243."
