    "message_1": "A steel manufacturing company produces sheets of steel with dimensions 10 ft x 20 ft. The company wants to cut out rectangular shaped pieces of steel from the sheets, with maximum area, without exceeding a total length of 40 ft for the cuts. What are the dimensions of each rectangular piece so that the total area is maximized?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular piece as x and y. The perimeter of the rectangular piece is given by P = 2x + 2y. Since the total length of the cuts cannot exceed 40 ft, we have:\n\n2x + 2y ≤ 40\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions x and y that maximize the area A = xy, subject to the constraint above.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the constraint equation:\n\nx + y ≤ 20\n\nNow, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 20 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the area equation:\n\nA(x) = x(20 - x) = 20x - x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the critical points of the function A(x). We do this by taking the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nA'(x) = 20 - 2x = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 10\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of x back into the expression for y:\n\ny = 20 - 10 = 10\n\nSo, the dimensions of each rectangular piece that maximize the total area are 10 ft x 10 ft."
