    "message_1": "A signal processing engineer wants to analyze a signal using the Fourier transform. The signal is sampled at a rate of 10 kHz and has a duration of 1 second. The engineer wants to plot the magnitude spectrum of the signal up to a frequency of 5 kHz. What is the frequency resolution of the Fourier transform?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency resolution of the Fourier transform, we can use the formula:\n\nFrequency Resolution = 1 / Signal Duration\n\nIn this case, the signal duration is 1 second. Therefore, the frequency resolution is:\n\nFrequency Resolution = 1 / 1 = 1 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency resolution of the Fourier transform is 1 Hz."
