    "message_1": "Suppose you have a knapsack with capacity of 10 kilograms, and you have 5 items with weights and values as follows:\n\nItem 1: 2 kg, value of $10\nItem 2: 3 kg, value of $15\nItem 3: 4 kg, value of $20\nItem 4: 5 kg, value of $25\nItem 5: 6 kg, value of $30\n\nWhat is the maximum value of items that you can fit in the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of items that can fit in the knapsack, we can use a greedy approach by selecting items with the highest value-to-weight ratio. However, this approach may not always yield the optimal solution. In this case, we can use a dynamic programming approach to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet's create a table with rows representing the items and columns representing the knapsack capacity from 0 to 10 kg. We will fill in the table by comparing the value of including the current item with the value of not including it.\n\nThe table will look like this:\n\n```\n   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10\n1  0   0  10  10  10  10  10  10  10  10  10\n2  0   0  10  15  15  25  25  25  25  25  25\n3  0   0  10  15  20  25  30  35  35  40  45\n4  0   0  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50\n5  0   0  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50\n```\n\nThe maximum value that can be fit in the knapsack is in the bottom-right cell, which is $50. This can be achieved by selecting items 3 and 4 (4 kg + 5 kg = 9 kg, $20 + $25 = $50)."
