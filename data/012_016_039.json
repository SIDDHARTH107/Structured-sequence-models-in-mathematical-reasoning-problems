    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we need to use the following recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G/e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nHere, G - e denotes the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G/e denotes the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges, we cannot directly compute the Tutte polynomial. There are multiple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges, and each of them will have a different Tutte polynomial.\n\nIf you provide a specific graph or its adjacency matrix, we can compute the Tutte polynomial for that graph."
