    "message_2": "To solve the non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 1, and then subtract the third equation from the second equation.\n\n2(2x - y + 3z) = 2(2)\n(3x + 2y - z) = 15\n\n4x - 2y + 6z = 4\n3x + 2y - z = 15\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(4x - 2y + 6z) + (3x + 2y - z) = 4 + 15\n7x + 5z = 19\n\nNow, let's eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -3 and the third equation by 1, and then add the two equations.\n\n-3(x + y + z) = -3(9)\n(3x + 2y - z) = 15\n\n-3x - 3y - 3z = -27\n3x + 2y - z = 15\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(-3x - 3y - 3z) + (3x + 2y - z) = -27 + 15\n-y - 4z = -12\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\n7x + 5z = 19\n-y - 4z = -12\n\nLet's solve the second equation for y:\n\ny = 4z - 12\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n7x + 5z = 19\n7x + 5z = 4z - 12\n\nNow, subtract 4z from both sides:\n\n3x = -7z + 19\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = (-7z + 19) / 3\n\nNow we have expressions for x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = (-7z + 19) / 3\ny = 4z - 12\n\nNow, substitute these expressions for x and y into the first equation:\n\n((-7z + 19) / 3) + (4z - 12) + z = 9\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n-7z + 19 + 12z - 36 + 3z = 27\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n8z - 17 = 27\n\nNow, add 17 to both sides:\n\n8z = 44\n\nNow, divide both sides by 8:\n\nz = 44 / 8\nz = 5.5\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into the expressions for x and y:\n\nx = (-7(5.5) + 19) / 3\nx = (-38.5 + 19) / 3\nx = -19.5 / 3\nx = -6.5\n\ny = 4(5.5) - 12\ny = 22 - 12\ny = 10\n\nSo, the solution to the non-homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -6.5\ny = 10\nz = 5.5"
