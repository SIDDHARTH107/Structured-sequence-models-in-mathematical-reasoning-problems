    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a transposition cipher with the key \"312\", we first need to arrange the message in a grid according to the key. The key has 3 digits, so we will arrange the message in columns of 3 characters each:\n\nH E L\nL O W\nO R L\nD\n\nNow, we reorder the columns based on the key \"312\":\n\nE H L\nO L W\nR O L\n  D\n\nFinally, we read the encrypted message by rows:\n\nThe ciphertext is: EOLRODHLWLD"
