The material for the base costs $10 per square meter, and the material for the sides costs $6 per square meter. Find the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of materials.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of one side of the square base, and let h be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by V = x^2 * h. We are given that the maximum volume is 500 cubic meters, so x^2 * h = 500.\n\nThe cost of the base is given by 10 * x^2, and the cost of the sides is given by 4 * 6 * x * h (since there are 4 sides, each with area x * h). Therefore, the total cost C is given by:\n\nC = 10x^2 + 24xh\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function. To do this, we can first eliminate one of the variables by solving for h in terms of x using the volume constraint:\n\nh = 500 / x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the cost function:\n\nC(x) = 10x^2 + 24x(500 / x^2)\n\nC(x) = 10x^2 + 12000 / x\n\nTo minimize the cost function, we can find its critical points by taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nC'(x) = 20x - 12000 / x^2\n\n20x - 12000 / x^2 = 0\n\nNow, multiply both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n20x^3 - 12000 = 0\n\nx^3 = 600\n\nx = (600)^(1/3)\n\nx ≈ 8.43 meters\n\nNow, we can find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 500 / x^2\n\nh = 500 / (8.43)^2\n\nh ≈ 7.08 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of materials are approximately 8.43 meters by 8.43 meters for the base, and a height of approximately 7.08 meters."
