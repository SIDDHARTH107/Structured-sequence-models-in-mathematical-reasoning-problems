If the probability of someone who takes the bus to work switching to driving is 0.05 and the probability of someone who drives to work switching to taking the bus is 0.02, what is the long-term proportion of people who take the bus to work?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the following notation:\n\nB = proportion of people who take the bus to work\nC = proportion of people who drive their own cars to work\nW = proportion of people who walk or bike to work\n\nInitially, we have:\nB = 0.20\nC = 0.50\nW = 0.30\n\nNow, let's consider the changes in proportions due to people switching between taking the bus and driving:\n\nΔB = 0.02 * C - 0.05 * B\nΔC = 0.05 * B - 0.02 * C\n\nIn the long term, the proportions will reach a steady state, so the changes in proportions will be zero:\n\nΔB = 0\nΔC = 0\n\nSo, we have the following equations:\n\n0.02 * C - 0.05 * B = 0\n0.05 * B - 0.02 * C = 0\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations. Multiplying the first equation by 0.05 and the second equation by 0.02, we get:\n\n0.001 * C - 0.0025 * B = 0\n0.001 * B - 0.0004 * C = 0\n\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n\n0.0006 * C - 0.0015 * B = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 0.0006, we get:\n\nC - 2.5 * B = 0\n\nSince we know that B + C + W = 1, and W = 0.30, we can write:\n\nB + C = 0.70\n\nNow we can substitute C from the first equation into the second equation:\n\nB + (2.5 * B) = 0.70\n3.5 * B = 0.70\n\nDividing both sides by 3.5, we get:\n\nB = 0.20\n\nSo, the long-term proportion of people who take the bus to work remains 0.20 or 20%."
