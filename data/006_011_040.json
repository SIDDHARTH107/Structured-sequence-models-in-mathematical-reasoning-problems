    "message_1": "In a manufacturing company, it is estimated that there is a 1 in 350 chance of a workplace accident occurring during any given shift. If the company operates 5 shifts a day, 7 days a week, what is the probability that at least one workplace accident will occur during a given week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the probability of no accidents occurring during a given week and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring.\n\nThe probability of no accident during a single shift is:\n349/350 (since there is a 1 in 350 chance of an accident)\n\nThe company operates 5 shifts a day, 7 days a week, which is a total of 35 shifts in a week. The probability of no accidents occurring in all 35 shifts is:\n(349/350)^35\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one accident occurring during the week, we will subtract the probability of no accidents from 1:\nProbability of at least one accident = 1 - (349/350)^35\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\nProbability of at least one accident ≈ 1 - 0.899 ≈ 0.101\n\nSo, there is approximately a 10.1% chance that at least one workplace accident will occur during a given week."
