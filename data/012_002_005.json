    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nWe can find the chromatic number of G by trying to color the vertices with the minimum number of colors. Let's try to color the graph using the greedy coloring algorithm:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1 with color A).\n3. Color vertex 3 with color C (since it's adjacent to vertex 1 with color A and vertex 2 with color B).\n4. Color vertex 4 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1 with color A).\n5. Color vertex 5 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertex 2 with color B, vertex 3 with color C, and vertex 4 with color B).\n6. Color vertex 6 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 5 with color A).\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph using 3 colors (A, B, and C). Therefore, the chromatic number of G is 3."
