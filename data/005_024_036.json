    "message_1": "In a data mining project, a math student found that the following grades were obtained by 10 students in a mathematics exam: 85, 78, 90, 92, 86, 89, 80, 84, 80, and 87. What is the mean, median and mode of the grades?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean, median, and mode of the grades, we first need to organize the data in ascending order: 78, 80, 80, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 92.\n\nMean: The mean is the average of the grades. To find the mean, add up all the grades and divide by the number of students (10).\n\nMean = (78 + 80 + 80 + 84 + 85 + 86 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 92) / 10\nMean = 851 / 10\nMean = 85.1\n\nMedian: The median is the middle value of the dataset. Since there are 10 grades (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th values).\n\nMedian = (85 + 86) / 2\nMedian = 171 / 2\nMedian = 85.5\n\nMode: The mode is the grade that appears most frequently in the dataset. In this case, the grade 80 appears twice, which is more frequent than any other grade.\n\nMode = 80\n\nSo, the mean is 85.1, the median is 85.5, and the mode is 80."
