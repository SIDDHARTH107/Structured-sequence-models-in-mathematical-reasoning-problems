    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a Vigenere cipher-encrypted message with the following ciphertext:\n\n`FGEKREJCDI`\n\nAssuming the key length is 4, and the first letter of the key is `D`, decrypt the message using cryptanalysis of Vigenere cipher.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using cryptanalysis of the Vigenere cipher, we will first need to determine the rest of the key. Since we know the key length is 4 and the first letter is 'D', we can represent the key as `D? ? ?`. \n\nNow, we will group the ciphertext letters according to the key positions:\n\n1. F G E K R E J C D I\n2. F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3. _ G _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n4. _ _ E _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n5. _ _ _ K _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nNow, we will use frequency analysis to determine the most likely letters for the remaining key positions. We will compare the frequency of the letters in each group to the frequency of letters in the English language.\n\nFor the second position (G):\nThe most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. We will try shifting G by each of these letters and see which one results in a common English letter.\n\nG -> E (shift by T): E\nG -> T (shift by A): B\nG -> A (shift by O): V\nG -> O (shift by I): X\nG -> I (shift by N): S\nG -> N (shift by S): K\nG -> S (shift by H): Q\nG -> H (shift by R): Z\nG -> R (shift by D): M\nG -> D (shift by L): U\n\nThe most likely shift is by 'N', as it results in 'S', a common English letter. So, the second letter of the key is 'N'.\n\nFor the fourth position (E):\nFollowing the same process as before:\n\nE -> E (shift by T): T\nE -> T (shift by A): A\nE -> A (shift by O): O\nE -> O (shift by I): I\nE -> I (shift by N): N\nE -> N (shift by S): S\nE -> S (shift by H): H\nE -> H (shift by R): R\nE -> R (shift by D): D\nE -> D (shift by L): L\n\nThe most likely shift is by 'A', as it results in 'T', a common English letter. So, the fourth letter of the key is 'A'.\n\nNow we have the key: `DNA?`. Since the key length is 4, we can assume that the third position of the key is not very important for a short ciphertext. We can try decrypting the message with the partial key `DNA`.\n\nCiphertext: FGEKREJCDI\nKey:        DNADNADNA\n\nPlaintext:  FORT?E?CHI\n\nThe decrypted message is \"FORT?E?CHI\". The missing letters can be guessed based on the context, and the most likely plaintext is \"FORTRESSHI\" or \"FORTBEACHI\" depending on the context."
