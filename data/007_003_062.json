    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 3^101 is divided by 8, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We will find the pattern of remainders when powers of 3 are divided by 8.\n\n1. 3^1 % 8 = 3\n2. 3^2 % 8 = 9 % 8 = 1\n3. 3^3 % 8 = 27 % 8 = 3\n4. 3^4 % 8 = 81 % 8 = 1\n5. 3^5 % 8 = 243 % 8 = 3\n...\n\nAs we can see, the remainders repeat in a cycle of 3, 1. Since 101 is an odd number, the remainder when 3^101 is divided by 8 will be the same as the remainder when 3^1 is divided by 8.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 3^101 is divided by 8 is 3."
