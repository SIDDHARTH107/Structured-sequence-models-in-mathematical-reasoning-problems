    "message_1": "A study in a college found that the average GPA of students in a particular course was 3.2 with a standard deviation of 0.4. If a random sample of 35 students from the same course is taken, what is the probability that the sample mean GPA will be greater than 3.5?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean and the z-score.\n\nThe sampling distribution of the sample mean is a distribution of all possible sample means for a given sample size. According to the Central Limit Theorem, if the sample size is large enough (usually n ≥ 30), the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution (μx̄) is equal to the population mean (μ), which is 3.2 in this case. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx̄) is equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n):\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n\nσx̄ = 0.4 / √35\nσx̄ ≈ 0.0676\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 3.5. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (x̄ - μx̄) / σx̄\nz = (3.5 - 3.2) / 0.0676\nz ≈ 4.44\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean GPA will be greater than 3.5, which means we need to find the area to the right of the z-score 4.44 in the standard normal distribution table. Since the z-score is very high, the probability will be very low. Using a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability is close to 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample mean GPA will be greater than 3.5 is approximately 0 or very close to 0."
