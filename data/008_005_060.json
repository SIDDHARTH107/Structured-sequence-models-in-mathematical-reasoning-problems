    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using non-homogeneous methods, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we will write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n| 3  2  1 | 12 |\n| 2 -1  4 |  1 |\n| 1  3  2 |  7 |\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n\n```\n| 1  3  2 |  7 |\n| 2 -1  4 |  1 |\n| 3  2  1 | 12 |\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n```\n| 1  3  2 |  7  |\n| 0 -7  0 | -13 |\n| 0 -7 -5 | -9  |\n```\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by -7:\n\n```\n| 1  3  2 |  7 |\n| 0  1  0 | 13/7|\n| 0 -7 -5 | -9 |\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 1 with (-3 * Row 2) + Row 1 and Row 3 with (7 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n```\n| 1  0  2 | -4/7 |\n| 0  1  0 | 13/7 |\n| 0  0 -5 |  4   |\n```\n\n5. Divide Row 3 by -5:\n\n```\n| 1  0  2 | -4/7 |\n| 0  1  0 | 13/7 |\n| 0  0  1 | -4/5 |\n```\n\n6. Replace Row 1 with (-2 * Row 3) + Row 1:\n\n```\n| 1  0  0 |  8/35|\n| 0  1  0 | 13/7 |\n| 0  0  1 | -4/5 |\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form, and we can read the solutions directly:\n\nx = 8/35\ny = 13/7\nz = -4/5"
