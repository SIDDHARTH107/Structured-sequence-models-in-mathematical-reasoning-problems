    "message_1": "Let X be a nonsingular cubic curve given by the equation Y^2Z - X^3 - Z^3 = 0 in projective space P^2. Let L be a line in P^2 which intersects X at three distinct points P, Q and R. Find the equation of the unique conic (in P^2) which passes through P, Q, R and is tangent to X at each of these three points.",
    "message_2": "Let the line L be given by the equation aX + bY + cZ = 0, where a, b, and c are constants. The points P, Q, and R are the intersection points of the line L and the cubic curve X, so they satisfy both equations. Let's denote the coordinates of P, Q, and R as (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), and (x3, y3, z3), respectively.\n\nSince the conic is tangent to the cubic curve X at P, Q, and R, the intersection multiplicity of the conic and the cubic curve at these points must be at least 2. To find the equation of the conic, we can use the following determinant form:\n\nC = λL^2 - μX,\n\nwhere λ and μ are constants to be determined. The conic C must pass through P, Q, and R, so we have:\n\nλ(aX1 + bY1 + cZ1)^2 - μ(Y1^2Z1 - X1^3 - Z1^3) = 0,\nλ(aX2 + bY2 + cZ2)^2 - μ(Y2^2Z2 - X2^3 - Z2^3) = 0,\nλ(aX3 + bY3 + cZ3)^2 - μ(Y3^2Z3 - X3^3 - Z3^3) = 0.\n\nThis is a system of three linear equations in λ and μ. We can solve this system to find λ and μ, and then substitute them back into the equation for C to obtain the equation of the conic.\n\nHowever, since the conic is tangent to the cubic curve at P, Q, and R, we also need to ensure that the intersection multiplicity is at least 2. To do this, we can compute the partial derivatives of the cubic curve X with respect to X, Y, and Z:\n\n∂X/∂X = -3X^2,\n∂X/∂Y = 2YZ,\n∂X/∂Z = Y^2 - 3Z^2.\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection multiplicity at P, Q, and R by evaluating the partial derivatives at these points and checking that they satisfy the following conditions:\n\n(∂X/∂X)(x1, y1, z1) * (aX1 + bY1 + cZ1) + (∂X/∂Y)(x1, y1, z1) * a + (∂X/∂Z)(x1, y1, z1) * c = 0,\n(∂X/∂X)(x2, y2, z2) * (aX2 + bY2 + cZ2) + (∂X/∂Y)(x2, y2, z2) * a + (∂X/∂Z)(x2, y2, z2) * c = 0,\n(∂X/∂X)(x3, y3, z3) * (aX3 + bY3 + cZ3) + (∂X/∂Y)(x3, y3, z3) * a + (∂X/∂Z)(x3, y3, z3) * c = 0.\n\nIf these conditions are satisfied, then the conic C is tangent to the cubic curve X at P, Q, and R. Once we have found λ and μ, we can substitute them back into the equation for C to obtain the equation of the unique conic that passes through P, Q, R and is tangent to X at each of these three points."
