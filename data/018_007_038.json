    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted by P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. To find the number of elements in the power set of A, we can consider each element of A as having two possibilities: either it is in a particular subset or it is not. Therefore, for each of the n elements in A, there are 2 choices. The total number of possible subsets (i.e., the number of elements in the power set) is the product of these choices, which is 2^n.\n\nNow, we need to prove that the cardinality of the power set of A is always greater than n. We know that the cardinality of the power set of A is 2^n. We want to show that 2^n > n for all positive integers n.\n\nWe can prove this by induction.\n\nBase case: n = 1\n2^1 = 2 > 1, so the statement holds for n = 1.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume that the statement holds for n = k, i.e., 2^k > k.\nWe want to show that the statement also holds for n = k + 1, i.e., 2^(k+1) > k + 1.\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k > 2 * k (since 2^k > k by the inductive hypothesis)\nNow, we need to show that 2 * k > k + 1.\nThis is equivalent to showing that k > 1, which is true for all positive integers k â‰¥ 2.\n\nThus, by induction, we have shown that the cardinality of the power set of A is always greater than n for all positive integers n."
