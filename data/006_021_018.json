    "message_2": "To find the probability of heavy rainfall on at least 3 days in a given month, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, heavy rainfall days) in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (heavy rainfall days), k is the number of events we are interested in, λ is the average number of events (in this case, 4 days of heavy rainfall per month), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 3 days of heavy rainfall, we need to find the probability of 3, 4, 5, ... days of heavy rainfall and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of 0, 1, and 2 days of heavy rainfall and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X < 3) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 days of heavy rainfall using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-4) * 4^0) / 0! = e^(-4) ≈ 0.0183\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-4) * 4^1) / 1! = 4 * e^(-4) ≈ 0.0733\nP(X = 2) = (e^(-4) * 4^2) / 2! = 8 * e^(-4) ≈ 0.1465\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 3 days of heavy rainfall:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)) ≈ 1 - (0.0183 + 0.0733 + 0.1465) ≈ 1 - 0.2381 ≈ 0.7619\n\nSo, the probability of heavy rainfall on at least 3 days in a given month is approximately 0.7619 or 76.19%."
