    "message_2": "Let's denote the closed curve as C. Since C intersects itself transversally at exactly 4 points, we can consider these 4 points as double points, where two branches of the curve intersect each other. Let's denote these double points as P1, P2, P3, and P4.\n\nNow, we will use the self-intersection number formula for a curve on a compact connected orientable 2-dimensional manifold. The self-intersection number (I) of a curve C is given by:\n\nI(C) = Σ_i (n_i - 1),\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all double points, and n_i is the local intersection number at the i-th double point.\n\nSince C intersects itself transversally at each double point, the local intersection number at each double point is 2. Therefore, we have:\n\nI(C) = Σ_i (n_i - 1) = Σ_i (2 - 1) = Σ_i 1,\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all 4 double points.\n\nSo, the self-intersection number of the curve C is:\n\nI(C) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4."
