    "message_2": "To find the number of different possible combinations of employees, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of candidates (15), k is the number of positions to fill (6), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(15, 6) = 15! / (6! * (15 - 6)!)\n\nC(15, 6) = 15! / (6! * 9!)\n\nC(15, 6) = (15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9!)/(6! * 9!)\n\nC(15, 6) = (15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10)/(6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(15, 6) = 5005\n\nSo, there are 5005 different possible combinations of employees that the company can choose."
