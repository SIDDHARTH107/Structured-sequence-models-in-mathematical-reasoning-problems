    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. In other words, we need to find a generator of G.\n\nSince G has order 17, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 17. Since 17 is prime, the order of any non-identity element in G must be 17 itself.\n\nLet g be any non-identity element in G. Then the order of g is 17, which means that the subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has 17 elements. Since G has 17 elements, we have that ⟨g⟩ = G. This means that G is cyclic, and g is a generator of G.\n\nTo find a generator of G, we can use the following procedure:\n\n1. Choose an arbitrary non-identity element g in G.\n2. Check if the order of g is 17. If it is, then g is a generator of G. If not, go back to step 1 and choose another non-identity element.\n\nSince G is a group of prime order, the probability of choosing a generator at random is relatively high (in this case, 16/17). Therefore, this procedure should quickly find a generator of G."
