    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct symmetries of M, we need to analyze the group G of rotations of a cylinder of height h and radius r. The cylinder has two types of symmetries: rotational and translational.\n\n1. Rotational Symmetry:\nThe rotational symmetry of a cylinder is around its central axis. Since the cylinder is a smooth manifold, it can be rotated by any angle between 0 and 2Ï€. Therefore, the rotational symmetry is continuous, and there are infinitely many distinct rotational symmetries.\n\n2. Translational Symmetry:\nThe translational symmetry of a cylinder is along its height. Since the height of the cylinder is h, it can be translated by any distance between 0 and h along its height. Therefore, the translational symmetry is also continuous, and there are infinitely many distinct translational symmetries.\n\nSince both rotational and translational symmetries are continuous and have infinitely many distinct symmetries, the total number of distinct symmetries of M is infinite."
