    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is based on the brood parasitism behavior of some cuckoo species. The algorithm is stochastic and iterative, which means it uses randomness and multiple iterations to find the optimal solution. Here, we will provide a general outline of the cuckoo search algorithm and apply it to the given problem.\n\n1. Initialize the population of cuckoo nests (solutions) randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) using the objective function f(x).\n3. Choose a random nest and generate a new solution by performing a random walk (Levy flight) in the search space.\n4. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n5. If the new solution is better than the worst solution in the current population, replace the worst solution with the new solution.\n6. Randomly choose a fraction of the nests to be abandoned (replaced with new random solutions).\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy).\n\nApplying the cuckoo search algorithm to the given problem, f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 7, we can find the optimal value of x and the minimum value of the function. However, due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, the results may vary between different runs of the algorithm.\n\nIt is important to note that the cuckoo search algorithm is not guaranteed to find the global minimum of the function, especially for complex functions with multiple local minima. In such cases, it may be necessary to run the algorithm multiple times with different initializations or use other optimization techniques to verify the results.\n\nFor this specific problem, it is recommended to use other optimization methods (e.g., gradient descent or Newton's method) to find the exact minimum value and the corresponding x value. The cuckoo search algorithm is more suitable for problems where the objective function is not easily differentiable or has a complex search space."
