    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation:\n\nu_t = 5u_xx + 10t^2\n\nwhere u(x,t) is a function of two variables x and t. \n\nIf the initial condition is given by \n\nu(x,0) = sin(2πx)\n\nand the boundary conditions are given by \n\nu(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0 \n\nfor all t≥0,\n\nFind the solution u(x,t) that satisfies the given conditions.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial and boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution u(x, t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the PDE:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 5X''(x)T(t) + 10t^2\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by 5XT:\n\nT'(t) / (5T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x) + 2t^2 / 5\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / (5T(t)) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ - 2t^2 / 5\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1) T'(t) = -5λT(t)\n2) X''(x) = (-λ - 2t^2 / 5)X(x)\n\nLet's solve the second ODE first:\n\nX''(x) = (-λ - 2t^2 / 5)X(x)\n\nSince the boundary conditions are given by u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0, we have:\n\nX(0) = X(1) = 0\n\nThis is a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem. The eigenfunctions are given by:\n\nX_n(x) = sin(nπx)\n\nwith corresponding eigenvalues:\n\nλ_n = n^2π^2\n\nNow, let's solve the first ODE:\n\nT'(t) = -5λT(t)\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE. The solution is given by:\n\nT_n(t) = A_n * exp(-5n^2π^2t)\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[X_n(x)T_n(t)] = ∑[A_n * sin(nπx) * exp(-5n^2π^2t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(2πx):\n\nsin(2πx) = ∑[A_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nComparing the terms, we have:\n\nA_1 = 0\nA_2 = 1\nA_n = 0 for n ≠ 2\n\nSo, the solution u(x, t) that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\nu(x, t) = sin(2πx) * exp(-20π^2t)"
