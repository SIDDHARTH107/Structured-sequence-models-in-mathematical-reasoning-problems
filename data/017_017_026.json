    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 30. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, both of which are normal in G. Let p and q be the orders of P and Q, respectively. Then, p = 5 and q = 3.\n\nSince P and Q are normal in G, we can form the direct product P × Q, which is a subgroup of G. The order of P × Q is |P| × |Q| = 5 × 3 = 15. Now, let R be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is either 1, 3, 5, or 15. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it is normal in G, and G would be a direct product of P, Q, and R, which would make G a cyclic group of order 30, i.e., G is isomorphic to C30.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are more than one Sylow 2-subgroups. Let R be one of them, and let r be its order. Then, r = 2. Since |G| = 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, we have |G:P × Q| = 2, and so G acts on the cosets of P × Q by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism φ: G → S₂, where S₂ is the symmetric group on two elements.\n\nLet K = ker(φ). Then, K is a normal subgroup of G, and by the first isomorphism theorem, G/K is isomorphic to the image of φ, which is a subgroup of S₂. Since |S₂| = 2, the image of φ has order 1 or 2. If the image has order 1, then φ is the trivial homomorphism, and G is isomorphic to P × Q × R, which is a cyclic group of order 30, i.e., G is isomorphic to C30.\n\nIf the image of φ has order 2, then |K| = |G| / 2 = 15, and K = P × Q. In this case, G is a semidirect product of K and R, i.e., G = K ⋊ R. Since R has order 2, there are only two possible actions of R on K: the trivial action and the action by inversion. If R acts trivially on K, then G is the direct product of K and R, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n\nIf R acts on K by inversion, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15. To see this, let x be a generator of P, y be a generator of Q, and z be a generator of R. Then, G is generated by x, y, and z, with the relations x^5 = y^3 = z^2 = 1, xy = yx, and xz = zx^4, yz = zy^2. This presentation is isomorphic to the presentation of D15, which has generators a, b, and c, with the relations a^5 = b^3 = c^2 = 1, ab = ba, and ac = ca^4, bc = cb^2.\n\nIn summary, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, depending on the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3- and 5-subgroups."
