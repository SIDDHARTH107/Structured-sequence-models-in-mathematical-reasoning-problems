    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is created by iterating the Koch curve process. In each iteration, every straight line segment is replaced with a new pattern, which consists of 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, the total length after the first iteration is 4 * (1/3) = 4/3.\n\nIn each subsequent iteration, the number of segments is multiplied by 4, and the length of each segment is divided by 3. Therefore, the total length of the Koch snowflake after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (4/3)^n\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we have:\n\nLength = (4/3)^4 = 256/81 â‰ˆ 3.1605\n\nSo, the length of the Koch snowflake curve after the 4th iteration is approximately 3.1605 units."
