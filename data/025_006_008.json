    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups H^i(X,ℂ) for i = 0,1,2, we first need to understand the topology of the algebraic variety X. The equation x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 defines a circle in the complex plane, which is topologically equivalent to a 1-dimensional sphere, S^1.\n\nNow, we can use the singular cohomology theory with coefficients in the complex numbers ℂ. For a 1-dimensional sphere, the cohomology groups are given by:\n\nH^0(S^1,ℂ) = ℂ\nH^1(S^1,ℂ) = ℂ\nH^2(S^1,ℂ) = 0\n\nThe reason behind these values is as follows:\n\n1. H^0(S^1,ℂ) represents the global sections of the constant sheaf ℂ on S^1. Since S^1 is connected, there is only one global section, which corresponds to the constant functions. Thus, H^0(S^1,ℂ) = ℂ.\n\n2. H^1(S^1,ℂ) represents the first cohomology group, which measures the \"holes\" in the space. Since S^1 has one \"hole\" (it is a circle), H^1(S^1,ℂ) = ℂ.\n\n3. H^2(S^1,ℂ) represents the second cohomology group, which measures the \"voids\" or \"enclosed volumes\" in the space. Since S^1 is a 1-dimensional object, it has no enclosed volumes, and thus H^2(S^1,ℂ) = 0.\n\nSo, the cohomology groups H^i(X,ℂ) for i = 0,1,2 are:\n\nH^0(X,ℂ) = ℂ\nH^1(X,ℂ) = ℂ\nH^2(X,ℂ) = 0"
