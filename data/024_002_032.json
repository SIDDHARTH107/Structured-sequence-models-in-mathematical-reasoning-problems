    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. Geodesics on the surface of a sphere are segments of great circles.\n\nGiven a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, we want to find the geodesics that intersect the point (3, 4, 0) and make an angle of 60 degrees with the x-axis at that point.\n\nFirst, let's find the normal vector to the plane of the great circle that contains the geodesic. Since the angle between the geodesic and the x-axis is 60 degrees, the angle between the normal vector and the x-axis is 90 - 60 = 30 degrees.\n\nLet the normal vector be N = (a, b, c). Then, the dot product of N and the x-axis unit vector (1, 0, 0) is equal to the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them:\n\nN · (1, 0, 0) = |N| * |(1, 0, 0)| * cos(30°)\n\nSince |(1, 0, 0)| = 1, we have:\n\na = |N| * cos(30°)\n\nNow, we know that the normal vector N is orthogonal to the vector connecting the center of the sphere (0, 0, 0) and the point (3, 4, 0). This vector is simply (3, 4, 0). So, the dot product of N and (3, 4, 0) is 0:\n\nN · (3, 4, 0) = 3a + 4b = 0\n\nWe can solve for b:\n\nb = -3/4 * a\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the plane of the great circle passes through the center of the sphere (0, 0, 0) and the point (3, 4, 0). The equation of the plane can be written as:\n\nax + by + cz = d\n\nSubstituting the point (3, 4, 0):\n\n3a - 3b = d\n\nSince the plane passes through the origin, d = 0:\n\n3a - 3b = 0\n\nNow we have two equations for a and b:\n\na = |N| * cos(30°)\nb = -3/4 * a\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first:\n\na = |N| * cos(30°)\n-3/4 * a = -3/4 * |N| * cos(30°)\n\nSince a ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by -3/4:\n\nb = |N| * cos(30°)\n\nNow we have:\n\na = |N| * cos(30°)\nb = |N| * cos(30°)\n\nSince a and b are not both 0, we can conclude that |N| ≠ 0. Thus, we can normalize the normal vector N:\n\nN = (cos(30°), cos(30°), c/|N|)\n\nNow we can find the equation of the plane containing the great circle:\n\ncos(30°)x + cos(30°)y + c/|N|z = 0\n\nSince the point (3, 4, 0) lies on the plane:\n\ncos(30°)*3 + cos(30°)*4 = 0\n\nSolving for cos(30°):\n\ncos(30°) = -4/7\n\nNow we have the equation of the plane containing the great circle:\n\n-4/7x - 4/7y + c/|N|z = 0\n\nThe geodesic on the surface of the sphere is the intersection of this plane with the sphere. The equation of the sphere is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the geodesic on the surface of the sphere."
