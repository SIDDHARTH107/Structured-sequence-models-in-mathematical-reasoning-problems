    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(48), we need to find the prime factors of 48 and look for any pairs of the same factor that can be simplified.\n\n48 can be factored as 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 (2^4 × 3).\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root by taking out any pairs of the same factor:\n\n√(48) = √(2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3) = √(2^4 × 3) = 2^2 × √(3) = 4√(3).\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 4√(3)."
