    "message_1": "Suppose you have a portfolio with three stocks: stock A, stock B, and stock C. The expected annual returns and standard deviations for each stock are as follows:\n\n- Stock A: expected return of 10% with a standard deviation of 15%\n- Stock B: expected return of 12% with a standard deviation of 20%\n- Stock C: expected return of 8% with a standard deviation of 10%\n\nAssuming that the returns for each stock are normally distributed and that there is no correlation between the stocks, what combination of stocks should be included in the portfolio to minimize the portfolio's standard deviation while achieving an expected return of at least 9%?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal combination of stocks, we can use the concept of portfolio weights. Let the weights of stocks A, B, and C be represented by w_A, w_B, and w_C, respectively. The sum of the weights should be equal to 1, i.e., w_A + w_B + w_C = 1.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio can be calculated as follows:\nPortfolio Expected Return = w_A * Expected Return of A + w_B * Expected Return of B + w_C * Expected Return of C\n\nSince we want the expected return to be at least 9%, we have:\n0.09 ≤ w_A * 0.10 + w_B * 0.12 + w_C * 0.08\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio can be calculated as follows:\nPortfolio Standard Deviation = sqrt(w_A^2 * (Standard Deviation of A)^2 + w_B^2 * (Standard Deviation of B)^2 + w_C^2 * (Standard Deviation of C)^2)\n\nWe want to minimize the portfolio standard deviation, so we need to find the optimal weights that satisfy the expected return constraint and minimize the standard deviation.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function L as follows:\nL(w_A, w_B, w_C, λ) = w_A^2 * 0.15^2 + w_B^2 * 0.20^2 + w_C^2 * 0.10^2 - λ(w_A + w_B + w_C - 1)\n\nTaking the partial derivatives with respect to w_A, w_B, w_C, and λ, and setting them equal to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n1) 2 * w_A * 0.15^2 - λ = 0\n2) 2 * w_B * 0.20^2 - λ = 0\n3) 2 * w_C * 0.10^2 - λ = 0\n4) w_A + w_B + w_C = 1\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get the optimal weights as follows:\nw_A = 0.6, w_B = 0.2, and w_C = 0.2\n\nSo, the optimal combination of stocks to minimize the portfolio's standard deviation while achieving an expected return of at least 9% is 60% stock A, 20% stock B, and 20% stock C."
