Find (A complement x B complement) union (A complement x B) and compare it with (A complement x (B complement union B)) union (A complement x (B intersect B complement)). Show that the result verifies the statement \"The Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement\".",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the complements of sets A and B. Since no universal set is given, we will consider the union of A and B as the universal set. So, the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. Then, the complements of A and B are:\n\nA complement = U - A = {4, 6}\nB complement = U - B = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. A complement x B complement = {(4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3)}\n2. A complement x B = {(4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A complement x B complement) union (A complement x B) = {(4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find the other expression:\n\n1. B complement union B = U (since B complement and B are complements of each other)\n2. B intersect B complement = ∅ (since B complement and B are complements of each other, their intersection is an empty set)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. A complement x (B complement union B) = A complement x U = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\n2. A complement x (B intersect B complement) = A complement x ∅ = ∅ (since the Cartesian product with an empty set is an empty set)\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A complement x (B complement union B)) union (A complement x (B intersect B complement)) = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)} ∪ ∅ = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\n\nComparing the two results:\n\n(A complement x B complement) union (A complement x B) = {(4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\n\n(A complement x (B complement union B)) union (A complement x (B intersect B complement)) = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\n\nAlthough the results are the same in this case, it does not mean that the Cartesian product is distributive over complement. This is because the distributive property states that for all sets A, B, and C, A x (B ∪ C) = (A x B) ∪ (A x C) and A x (B ∩ C) = (A x B) ∩ (A x C). In this problem, we are not dealing with the union or intersection of sets B and C, but rather with the complements of sets A and B. Therefore, this problem does not disprove or verify the distributive property for Cartesian products."
