The expected returns and standard deviations for each stock are:\n\nStock A: expected return of 8% and standard deviation of 12%\nStock B: expected return of 10% and standard deviation of 15%\nStock C: expected return of 12% and standard deviation of 18%\n\nAssuming the investor wants to minimize risk while aiming for an expected return of at least 10%, what is the optimal investment amount for each stock?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of portfolio optimization. We will use the following variables:\n\nx_A: the proportion of the total investment in stock A\nx_B: the proportion of the total investment in stock B\nx_C: the proportion of the total investment in stock C\n\nThe constraints for this problem are:\n\n1. x_A + x_B + x_C = 1 (the sum of the proportions must equal 100%)\n2. 0.08x_A + 0.10x_B + 0.12x_C >= 0.10 (the expected return of the portfolio must be at least 10%)\n\nWe want to minimize the risk, which can be represented by the portfolio's variance. The variance of the portfolio can be calculated as follows:\n\nVar(P) = x_A^2 * σ_A^2 + x_B^2 * σ_B^2 + x_C^2 * σ_C^2 + 2 * x_A * x_B * Cov(A, B) + 2 * x_A * x_C * Cov(A, C) + 2 * x_B * x_C * Cov(B, C)\n\nHowever, we don't have the covariance values (Cov(A, B), Cov(A, C), and Cov(B, C)) for the stocks. Without these values, we cannot find the exact optimal investment amounts for each stock. \n\nIf we assume that the stocks are uncorrelated (Cov(A, B) = Cov(A, C) = Cov(B, C) = 0), the variance simplifies to:\n\nVar(P) = x_A^2 * σ_A^2 + x_B^2 * σ_B^2 + x_C^2 * σ_C^2\n\nNow, we can set up a quadratic optimization problem to minimize the variance subject to the constraints:\n\nMinimize: x_A^2 * (0.12)^2 + x_B^2 * (0.15)^2 + x_C^2 * (0.18)^2\nSubject to: x_A + x_B + x_C = 1\n            0.08x_A + 0.10x_B + 0.12x_C >= 0.10\n\nSolving this optimization problem would give us the optimal proportions of investment in each stock. However, this problem requires specialized optimization software or tools to solve. Once the optimal proportions are found, the investment amounts can be calculated by multiplying the proportions by the total investment of $100,000."
