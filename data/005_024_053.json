    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve from the subtopic of Data Mining in Statistics:\n\nIn a data set, 100 observations were recorded. The mean of the data set was found to be 25, and the standard deviation was 5. Calculate the Z-score of an observation that is equal to 32.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Z-score of an observation, we use the following formula:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere:\nZ = Z-score\nX = the observation value (in this case, 32)\nμ = the mean of the data set (in this case, 25)\nσ = the standard deviation of the data set (in this case, 5)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nZ = (32 - 25) / 5\nZ = 7 / 5\nZ = 1.4\n\nSo, the Z-score of the observation with a value of 32 is 1.4."
