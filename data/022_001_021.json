    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of f(z) = 1/(z^2 + 1) outside the unit circle, we can use the method of partial fraction decomposition. We first factor the denominator:\n\nz^2 + 1 = (z - i)(z + i),\n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit. Now we can write f(z) as a sum of two simpler fractions:\n\nf(z) = A/(z - i) + B/(z + i),\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we clear the denominators:\n\n1 = A(z + i) + B(z - i).\n\nNow we can solve for A and B by setting z = i and z = -i, respectively:\n\nFor z = i:\n1 = A(2i),\nA = 1/(2i) = -i/2.\n\nFor z = -i:\n1 = B(-2i),\nB = 1/(-2i) = i/2.\n\nNow we have the partial fraction decomposition of f(z):\n\nf(z) = -i/2 * (1/(z - i)) + i/2 * (1/(z + i)).\n\nThis representation is valid for all z except z = i and z = -i. Since the poles are not on the unit circle, this is an analytic continuation of f(z) outside the unit circle."
