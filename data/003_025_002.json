    "message_1": "A plane is flying at a velocity of 400 km/h due north. If there is a wind blowing from the northeast at 50 km/h, find the resulting velocity of the plane and the direction it is headed.",
    "message_2": "To find the resulting velocity of the plane, we need to break down the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity into their respective components and then add them together.\n\nLet's represent the plane's velocity as Vp and the wind's velocity as Vw. The plane is flying due north, so its velocity components are:\n\nVp_x = 0 km/h (no east-west component)\nVp_y = 400 km/h (north component)\n\nThe wind is blowing from the northeast, so it has both east and north components. We can find these components using the 45-45-90 triangle rule, since the wind is blowing at a 45-degree angle to the north and east directions. The components are:\n\nVw_x = -50 * cos(45) = -50 * (1/sqrt(2)) ≈ -35.36 km/h (west component, hence negative)\nVw_y = 50 * sin(45) = 50 * (1/sqrt(2)) ≈ 35.36 km/h (north component)\n\nNow, we can find the resulting velocity components by adding the plane's and wind's components:\n\nVr_x = Vp_x + Vw_x = 0 + (-35.36) = -35.36 km/h\nVr_y = Vp_y + Vw_y = 400 + 35.36 = 435.36 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resulting velocity using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nVr = sqrt(Vr_x^2 + Vr_y^2) = sqrt((-35.36)^2 + (435.36)^2) ≈ 437.24 km/h\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Vr_y / Vr_x) = arctan(435.36 / -35.36) ≈ -85.07 degrees\n\nSince the angle is negative, it means the direction is west of north. To express it as a positive angle, we can add 180 degrees:\n\nθ = -85.07 + 180 = 94.93 degrees\n\nSo, the resulting velocity of the plane is approximately 437.24 km/h, and it is headed at an angle of 94.93 degrees, which is 4.93 degrees west of north."
