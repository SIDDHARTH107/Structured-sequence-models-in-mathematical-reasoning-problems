    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is created through a series of iterations. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of (2√3).\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the Gosper curve is 1 * (2√3) = 2√3 units.\nAfter the second iteration, the length is (2√3) * (2√3) = 12 units.\nAfter the third iteration, the length is 12 * (2√3) = 24√3 units.\n\nSo, the length of the Gosper curve after the third iteration with an initial side length of 1 unit is 24√3 units."
