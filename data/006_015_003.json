    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a network of 500 devices experiencing a DDoS attack, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, DDoS attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the average number of attacks per hour, since the attack duration is given in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so the average number of attacks per hour is:\n\n(1 attack / 15 days) * (1 day / 24 hours) = 1/360 attacks per hour\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution formula to calculate the probability of a DDoS attack occurring in a 1-hour period:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere x is the number of events (DDoS attacks), λ is the average number of attacks per hour, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least one DDoS attack occurring (x ≥ 1). To do this, we can find the probability of no DDoS attacks occurring (x = 0) and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(x = 0) = (e^(-1/360) * (1/360)^0) / 0! = e^(-1/360)\n\nP(x ≥ 1) = 1 - P(x = 0) = 1 - e^(-1/360)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of e and calculate the probability:\n\nP(x ≥ 1) = 1 - (2.71828)^(-1/360) ≈ 0.00277\n\nSo, the probability of a network of 500 devices experiencing a DDoS attack in a 1-hour period is approximately 0.277% or 0.00277."
