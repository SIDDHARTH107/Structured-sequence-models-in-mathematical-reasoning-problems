    "message_2": "To find the values of x, y, and z at t = 100, we need to solve the given system of differential equations numerically. This can be done using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method or by using software like MATLAB or Python.\n\nHere, I will provide a Python code using the `scipy` library to solve the given system of differential equations and find the values of x, y, and z at t = 100.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\n# Define the Chua circuit differential equations\ndef chua_circuit(t, state, alpha, beta, gamma, m0, m1):\n    x, y, z = state\n    F_x = m1 * x + 0.5 * (m0 - m1) * (abs(x + 1) - abs(x - 1))\n    dx_dt = alpha * (y - x - F_x)\n    dy_dt = x - y + z\n    dz_dt = -beta * y - gamma * z\n    return [dx_dt, dy_dt, dz_dt]\n\n# Define the parameters\nalpha = 10\nbeta = 12\ngamma = 1\nm0 = -1.1428\nm1 = -0.7143\n\n# Define the initial conditions (assuming x(0) = y(0) = z(0) = 0)\ninitial_conditions = [0, 0, 0]\n\n# Define the time span\nt_span = (0, 100)\n\n# Solve the differential equations\nsolution = solve_ivp(chua_circuit, t_span, initial_conditions, args=(alpha, beta, gamma, m0, m1), dense_output=True)\n\n# Find the values of x, y, and z at t = 100\nx_100, y_100, z_100 = solution.sol(100)\nprint(\"x(100) =\", x_100)\nprint(\"y(100) =\", y_100)\nprint(\"z(100) =\", z_100)\n```\n\nBy running the above Python code, you will get the values of x, y, and z at t = 100. Note that the results may vary slightly depending on the numerical method used and the tolerances set in the solver."
