    "message_2": "A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as input and returns a function as output. In this case, we are asked to find the total number of higher-order functions from X to X, where X is a set with five elements.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of functions from X to X. Since there are five elements in X, and each element in the domain can be mapped to any of the five elements in the codomain, there are 5^5 = 3125 functions from X to X.\n\nNow, let's consider the higher-order functions. A higher-order function takes a function as input and returns a function as output. Since there are 3125 functions from X to X, a higher-order function can take any of these 3125 functions as input. Furthermore, since it returns a function as output, there are 3125 possible output functions as well.\n\nTherefore, the total number of higher-order functions from X to X is the number of ways to choose an input function and an output function, which is 3125 * 3125 = 9,765,625."
