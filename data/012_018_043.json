    "message_2": "To find the edge connectivity of a graph, we need to determine the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, we are looking for the smallest number of edges that, when removed, will result in at least one vertex being isolated from the rest of the graph.\n\nFor a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we can use Menger's theorem to find the edge connectivity. Menger's theorem states that the edge connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any two vertices in the graph.\n\nLet's denote the edge connectivity as λ(G). To find λ(G), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a pair of vertices in the graph, say u and v.\n2. Find the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths between u and v.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all pairs of vertices in the graph.\n4. The edge connectivity λ(G) is the minimum value obtained in step 2.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific arrangement of the edges in the graph, we cannot determine the exact edge connectivity. If you provide more information about the graph's structure, we can help you find the edge connectivity."
