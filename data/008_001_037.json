    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we'll first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -3 |  1 ]\n[ 2 -1  2 |  8 ]\n[ 1 -3  4 |  2 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\nStep 1: Subtract the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -3 |  1 ]\n[ 2 -1  2 |  8 ]\n[ 0 -5  7 |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Subtract twice the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -3 |  1 ]\n[ 0 -5  8 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -5  7 |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -5:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -3 |  1 ]\n[ 0  1 -8/5 | -6/5 ]\n[ 0 -5  7 |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Add 5 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -3 |  1 ]\n[ 0  1 -8/5 | -6/5 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | -1 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form, and we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = -1.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - (8/5)(-1) = -6/5, which gives y = 2.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + 2(2) - 3(-1) = 1, which gives x = -2.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -2, y = 2, and z = -1."
