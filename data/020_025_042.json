    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve on the topic of optimal routing:\n\nA delivery truck needs to visit six different locations in a city, starting and ending at the warehouse. The distances between each location are as follows:\n\n- Warehouse to Location 1: 8 km\n- Location 1 to Location 2: 12 km\n- Location 2 to Location 3: 5 km\n- Location 3 to Location 4: 7 km\n- Location 4 to Location 5: 10 km\n- Location 5 to Warehouse: 15 km\n\nWhat is the shortest total distance the truck can travel while visiting all six locations exactly once each, and returning to the warehouse?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest total distance, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate the total distance for each route. Since there are 5 locations to visit (excluding the warehouse), there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, which is 120 routes. However, we can simplify the problem by considering that the route is a round trip, so we can divide the number of routes by 2, which gives us 60 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1.
