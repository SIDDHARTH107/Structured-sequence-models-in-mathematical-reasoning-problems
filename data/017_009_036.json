    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 9, we know that the order of G is a power of a prime number (9 = 3^2). According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to either C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). However, C3 × C3 is an abelian group, and there is no non-abelian group of order 9. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nThe elements of G can be represented as {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^8}, where g is a generator of G. The generators of G are the elements with order 9. In a cyclic group of order 9, there are two generators: g and g^8 (g^8 is the inverse of g).\n\nSo, the elements of G are {g^0, g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7, g^8}, and the generators of G are {g, g^8}."
