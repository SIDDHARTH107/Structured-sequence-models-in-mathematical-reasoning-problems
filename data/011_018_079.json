    "message_2": "In a tournament with 10 teams, each team plays against every other team exactly once. To find the total number of games played, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams and k is the number of teams playing in each game (which is 2 in this case).\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2 * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9)/(2)\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, there are a total of 45 games played in the tournament."
