    "message_1": "Suppose you have a text consisting of 60 characters encrypted with a transposition cipher. The text is split into six rows of ten characters each. If the cipher works by reading the text column-wise from top to bottom, what is the length of each column of the decrypted text?",
    "message_2": "If the encrypted text has 60 characters and is split into six rows of ten characters each, then the decrypted text will also have 60 characters. Since the cipher works by reading the text column-wise from top to bottom, the decrypted text will have the same number of columns as the encrypted text has rows.\n\nSo, the decrypted text will have 6 columns. To find the length of each column, we can divide the total number of characters (60) by the number of columns (6):\n\nLength of each column = 60 characters / 6 columns = 10 characters\n\nTherefore, the length of each column of the decrypted text is 10 characters."
