    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = e^(-x) over the interval -∞ to ∞, we need to use the Fourier transform formula. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), i is the imaginary unit (i^2 = -1), and k is the frequency variable.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = e^(-x), we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x(1 + 2πik))] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can use the integral formula for exponential functions:\n\n∫[e^(ax)] dx = (1/a)e^(ax) + C\n\nApplying this formula to our integral, we get:\n\nF(k) = (1/(1 + 2πik)) * e^(-x(1 + 2πik)) from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the limit:\n\nF(k) = lim(x->∞) (1/(1 + 2πik)) * e^(-x(1 + 2πik)) - lim(x->-∞) (1/(1 + 2πik)) * e^(-x(1 + 2πik))\n\nAs x approaches ∞, the exponential term e^(-x(1 + 2πik)) goes to 0. As x approaches -∞, the exponential term e^(-x(1 + 2πik)) goes to ∞, but the term (1/(1 + 2πik)) goes to 0. Therefore, the limit as x approaches -∞ is also 0.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x) is:\n\nF(k) = 0\n\nThis means that the function f(x) = e^(-x) does not have any non-zero Fourier coefficients over the interval -∞ to ∞."
