    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b / (2a). In this case, a = 2 and b = 6.\n\nx = -6 / (2 * 2) = -6 / 4 = -3 / 2\n\nNow, we can plug this x-coordinate back into the equation to find the y-coordinate:\n\ny = 2(-3/2)^2 + 6(-3/2) - 3\n\ny = 2(9/4) - 9 - 3\n\ny = 9/2 - 9 - 3\n\ny = 9/2 - 18/2 - 6/2\n\ny = -15/2\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertex are (-3/2, -15/2)."
