    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor, 5 units of raw material, and generates a profit of $500. Each unit of product B requires 5 hours of labor, 2 units of raw material, and generates a profit of $800. The company has 120 hours of available labor and 50 units of raw material. What is the maximum profit the company can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We have the following constraints:\n\nLabor constraint: 2x + 5y ≤ 120\nRaw material constraint: 5x + 2y ≤ 50\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 500x + 800y.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nLabor constraint: y ≤ (120 - 2x) / 5\nRaw material constraint: y ≤ (50 - 5x) / 2\n\nNow we'll find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\n1. For the labor constraint, the line 2x + 5y = 120 intersects the x-axis at x = 60 and the y-axis at y = 24. The inequality 2x + 5y ≤ 120 represents the region below this line.\n2. For the raw material constraint, the line 5x + 2y = 50 intersects the x-axis at x = 10 and the y-axis at y = 25. The inequality 5x + 2y ≤ 50 represents the region below this line.\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these two regions, which is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 24), (10, 15), and (20, 0).\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 500(0) + 800(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 24) = 500(0) + 800(24) = $19,200\n3. P(10, 15) = 500(10) + 800(15) = $17,000\n4. P(20, 0) = 500(20) + 800(0) = $10,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 24), where the company produces 0 units of product A and 24 units of product B, resulting in a profit of $19,200."
