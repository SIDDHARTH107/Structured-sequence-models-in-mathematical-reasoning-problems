    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Relevance logic:\n\nSuppose we have three statements:\nP: The length of this rope is 10 meters.\nQ: The height of this building is 50 meters.\nR: The temperature outside is 30 degrees Celsius.\n\nUsing Relevance logic, determine the truth value of the following compound statement: \"P and Q implies R\".\n\nIs the statement true or false?",
    "message_2": "In Relevance logic, the truth value of a compound statement depends on the relevance of the statements involved. In this case, we have the compound statement \"P and Q implies R\". \n\nHowever, the statements P, Q, and R are unrelated to each other. The length of a rope and the height of a building have no direct connection to the temperature outside. Therefore, using Relevance logic, we cannot determine the truth value of the compound statement \"P and Q implies R\" because the statements are not relevant to each other."
