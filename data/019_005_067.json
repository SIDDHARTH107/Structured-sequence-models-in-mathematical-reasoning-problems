    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem in Epistemic Logic:\n\nSuppose there are three mathematicians - Alice, Bob, and Charlie - who know a number. One of them knows that the number is 4, another knows that the number is 7, and the third knows that the number is 9. They don't know which of them knows the correct number, but they each know that at least one of them knows it. Using Epistemic Logic, determine what each mathematician knows about the number.\n\nWhat is the answer?",
    "message_2": "Let's use Epistemic Logic to analyze the situation. We will represent the knowledge of each mathematician as follows:\n\nK_A: Alice knows the number.\nK_B: Bob knows the number.\nK_C: Charlie knows the number.\n\nInitially, we have the following knowledge for each mathematician:\n\nK_A(4) ∨ K_A(7) ∨ K_A(9)\nK_B(4) ∨ K_B(7) ∨ K_B(9)\nK_C(4) ∨ K_C(7) ∨ K_C(9)\n\nNow, let's analyze the information each mathematician has about the others:\n\n1. Alice knows that either Bob or Charlie knows the correct number. So, she knows:\nK_A(K_B(4) ∨ K_B(7) ∨ K_B(9)) ∧ K_A(K_C(4) ∨ K_C(7) ∨ K_C(9))\n\n2. Bob knows that either Alice or Charlie knows the correct number. So, he knows:\nK_B(K_A(4) ∨ K_A(7) ∨ K_A(9)) ∧ K_B(K_C(4) ∨ K_C(7) ∨ K_C(9))\n\n3. Charlie knows that either Alice or Bob knows the correct number. So, he knows:\nK_C(K_A(4) ∨ K_A(7) ∨ K_A(9)) ∧ K_C(K_B(4) ∨ K_B(7) ∨ K_B(9))\n\nHowever, since none of the mathematicians have any additional information to narrow down the possibilities, they cannot determine which of them knows the correct number. Therefore, each mathematician only knows that the number is one of the three possibilities (4, 7, or 9) and that at least one of the other two mathematicians knows the correct number."
