    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the input signal x(t), we can use the following formula:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nwhere X(f) is the Fourier transform of x(t), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nHowever, since x(t) is composed of sinusoidal functions, we can directly write the Fourier transform by recognizing the frequency components present in the signal.\n\nx(t) = 2cos(4πt) + 4sin(10πt) + 5cos(6πt)\n\nThe Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF{cos(2πft)} = 0.5[δ(f - f0) + δ(f + f0)]\n\nwhere δ(f) is the Dirac delta function, and f0 is the frequency of the cosine function.\n\nSimilarly, the Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF{sin(2πft)} = -j0.5[δ(f - f0) - δ(f + f0)]\n\nApplying these formulas to each term in x(t), we get:\n\nX(f) = 2 * 0.5[δ(f - 2) + δ(f + 2)] - 4j * 0.5[δ(f - 5) - δ(f + 5)] + 5 * 0.5[δ(f - 3) + δ(f + 3)]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nX(f) = [δ(f - 2) + δ(f + 2)] - 2j[δ(f - 5) - δ(f + 5)] + 2.5[δ(f - 3) + δ(f + 3)]\n\nNow, we can determine the frequency components present in the network by looking at the Dirac delta functions in X(f):\n\n1. f = 2 Hz (from the first cosine term)\n2. f = 5 Hz (from the sine term)\n3. f = 3 Hz (from the second cosine term)\n\nSo, the frequency components present in the network are 2 Hz, 5 Hz, and 3 Hz."
