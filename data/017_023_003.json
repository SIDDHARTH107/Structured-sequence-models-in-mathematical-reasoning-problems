    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 72, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFor n_2, the possible values are 1 and 9. For n_3, the possible values are 1 and 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, both of which are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since |P| and |Q| are coprime, PQ is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q. Thus, G is isomorphic to a group of order 8 × 9 = 72, which is a cyclic group C72.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup (P) and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, G has a normal subgroup of order 8. The factor group G/P has order 9, which is a power of 3, so G/P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. If G/P is isomorphic to C9, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P and a group of order 9. This gives us 9 non-abelian groups of order 72. If G/P is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P and a group of order 9. This gives us 18 non-abelian groups of order 72. In total, we have 27 non-abelian groups of order 72 in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are nine Sylow 2-subgroups and only one Sylow 3-subgroup (Q). Since Q is normal in G, G has a normal subgroup of order 9. The factor group G/Q has order 8, which is a power of 2, so G/Q is isomorphic to either C8, C4 × C2, or D_4 (dihedral group of order 8). If G/Q is isomorphic to C8, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Q and a group of order 8. This gives us 8 non-abelian groups of order 72. If G/Q is isomorphic to C4 × C2, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Q and a group of order 8. This gives us 8 non-abelian groups of order 72. If G/Q is isomorphic to D_4, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Q and a group of order 8. This gives us 8 non-abelian groups of order 72. In total, we have 24 non-abelian groups of order 72 in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are nine Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal in G, we cannot use the same approach as in the previous cases. However, we can still analyze the possible structures of G using the semidirect product. In this case, G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of a group of order 8 and a group of order 9. This gives us no additional non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIn summary, we have found the following possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C72 (Case 1).\n2. G is isomorphic to one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72 (27 from Case 2 and 24 from Case 3).\n\nWe have not found any possibility for G to be isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2. Therefore, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C72 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72."
