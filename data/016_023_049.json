    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal is a measure of its complexity and self-similarity. It is independent of the iteration level. For the Vicsek fractal, the Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, N = 5 (since it consists of 5 smaller copies of itself in each iteration), and the scaling factor s = 3 (since each side of the smaller squares is 1/3 the length of the original square).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension remains the same regardless of the iteration level, so the dimension is approximately 1.465 even when the iteration level is 4."
