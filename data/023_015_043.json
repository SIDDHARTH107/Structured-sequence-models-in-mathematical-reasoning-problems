    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given wave function, we can use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-i * 2π * k * x)] dx\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), i is the imaginary unit, and the integral is taken over the entire real line.\n\nHowever, since the given wave function is already expressed as a sum of sinusoidal functions, we can directly identify the frequency components present in the wave.\n\nThe wave function f(x) can be written as:\n\nf(x) = 3sin(2πx/10) + 4cos(4πx/10)\n\nThe first term, 3sin(2πx/10), has a frequency of 2π/10, or 1/5 cycles per unit length. The second term, 4cos(4πx/10), has a frequency of 4π/10, or 2/5 cycles per unit length.\n\nSo, the frequency components present in the wave are 1/5 and 2/5 cycles per unit length."
