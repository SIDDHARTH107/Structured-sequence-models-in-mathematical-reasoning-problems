    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of steps that the Turing machine M can take before halting, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for an input string of length n with an equal number of 0's and 1's.\n\nLet's assume n is an even number, as it must be for the input string to have an equal number of 0's and 1's. So, n = 2k, where k is the number of 0's and also the number of 1's.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the Turing machine M would have to compare each 0 with each 1 in the input string. This would involve traversing the entire string multiple times. For each 0, M would have to traverse the string to find a corresponding 1 and mark them both as \"checked\" (or any other method to indicate that they have been paired). \n\nFor the first 0, M would have to traverse the entire string (2k steps) to find the first 1. For the second 0, M would have to traverse the remaining unmarked characters (2k - 2 steps) to find the next 1, and so on. The total number of steps can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal steps = (2k) + (2k - 2) + (2k - 4) + ... + 2\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with k terms, a common difference of -2, and a first term of 2k. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, n = k, a1 = 2k, and an = 2. So, the sum is:\n\nTotal steps = (k * (2k + 2)) / 2\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nTotal steps = k * (k + 1)\n\nSo, for a given input string of length n with an equal number of 0's and 1's, the maximum number of steps that the Turing machine M can take before halting is k * (k + 1), where n = 2k."
