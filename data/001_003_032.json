    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 13\n\n4x - y = 7\n\nWhat are the values of x and y that satisfy both equations simultaneously?",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same:\n\n(2x + 3y) * 2 = 13 * 2\n4x + 6y = 26\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 26\n4x - y = 7\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - y) = 26 - 7\n4x + 6y - 4x + y = 19\n7y = 19\n\nNow, divide by 7 to find the value of y:\n\ny = 19 / 7\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find the value of x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 13\n2x + 3(19/7) = 13\n\nMultiply both sides by 7 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2x * 7 + 3 * 19 = 13 * 7\n14x + 57 = 91\n\nSubtract 57 from both sides:\n\n14x = 34\n\nNow, divide by 14 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 34 / 14\n\nSo the values of x and y that satisfy both equations simultaneously are:\n\nx = 34/14\ny = 19/7"
