    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the definition of connectedness and the fact that A is both open and closed in X.\n\nRecall that a topological space X is connected if there does not exist a non-empty proper subset A of X such that A is both open and closed in X. In other words, X is connected if the only subsets of X that are both open and closed are the empty set ∅ and the whole space X itself.\n\nNow, we are given that X is connected and A is a subset of X that is both open and closed. By the definition of connectedness, this means that A must be either the empty set ∅ or the whole space X.\n\nTherefore, if X is connected and A is both open and closed in X, then A = ∅ or A = X."
