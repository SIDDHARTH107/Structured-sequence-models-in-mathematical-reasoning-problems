    "message_1": "A wheel with a diameter of 30 centimeters needs a new tire. What is the circumference of the wheel to figure out how much new tire is needed?",
    "message_2": "To find the circumference of the wheel, we can use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π × diameter (D)\n\nThe diameter of the wheel is given as 30 centimeters. Therefore,\n\nC = π × 30\n\nUsing the value of π as approximately 3.14, we get:\n\nC = 3.14 × 30\nC ≈ 94.2 centimeters\n\nSo, approximately 94.2 centimeters of new tire is needed for the wheel."
