    "message_1": "Suppose two players are playing the Dictator Game. The dictator is given $100 to split between themselves and the receiver. The dictator can choose any amount to keep for themselves and give the remaining amount to the receiver. If the receiver accepts the amount given, both players keep the money as allocated. However, if the receiver rejects the amount, both players end up with nothing. \n\nIf the dictator offers the receiver $30, what is the minimum amount that the receiver should accept to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the receiver's goal is to maximize their payoff. Since the receiver has no power over the dictator's decision, they should accept any amount greater than $0 to ensure they receive some money. If they reject the offer, they end up with nothing. Therefore, the minimum amount the receiver should accept to maximize their payoff is $1."
