    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is generated by repeatedly applying a specific set of rules to an equilateral triangle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, the perimeter at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = P * (2^n + 1)\n\nwhere P is the perimeter of the original triangle, n is the number of iterations, and ^ denotes exponentiation.\n\nIn this case, the original triangle has a perimeter of 4, and we want to find the perimeter of the 5th iteration (n = 5).\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (2^5 + 1)\nPerimeter = 4 * (32 + 1)\nPerimeter = 4 * 33\nPerimeter = 132\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is 132."
