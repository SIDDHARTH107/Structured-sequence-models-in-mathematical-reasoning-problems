    "message_2": "To compute the non-zero components of the Cartan connection associated with the given Riemannian metric g, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are defined as:\n\nΓᵏᵢⱼ = 1/2 * gᵏˡ ( ∂gᵢˡ/∂xⱼ + ∂gⱼˡ/∂xᵢ - ∂gᵢⱼ/∂xˡ )\n\nGiven the metric tensor g:\n\ng = [ [1, 0, 0],\n      [0, 4, 0],\n      [0, 0, 4] ]\n\nWe can see that the metric tensor is diagonal, which simplifies the computation of the Christoffel symbols. We can now compute the non-zero components of the Christoffel symbols:\n\nΓ¹₂₂ = 1/2 * g¹¹ ( ∂g₁₂/∂x₂ + ∂g₂₁/∂x₁ - ∂g₁₂/∂x¹ ) = 0\nΓ¹₃₃ = 1/2 * g¹¹ ( ∂g₁₃/∂x₃ + ∂g₃₁/∂x₁ - ∂g₁₃/∂x¹ ) = 0\nΓ²₁₂ = 1/2 * g²² ( ∂g₂₁/∂x₂ + ∂g₁₂/∂x₂ - ∂g₂₁/∂x² ) = 0\nΓ²₃₃ = 1/2 * g²² ( ∂g₂₃/∂x₃ + ∂g₃₂/∂x₂ - ∂g₂₃/∂x² ) = 0\nΓ³₁₃ = 1/2 * g³³ ( ∂g₃₁/∂x₃ + ∂g₁₃/∂x₃ - ∂g₃₁/∂x³ ) = 0\nΓ³₂₃ = 1/2 * g³³ ( ∂g₃₂/∂x₃ + ∂g₂₃/∂x₂ - ∂g₃₂/∂x³ ) = 0\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols are zero, the Cartan connection associated with the given Riemannian metric g is also zero at any point on the manifold M, including the point (1, 2, 1)."
