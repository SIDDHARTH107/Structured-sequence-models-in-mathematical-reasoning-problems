The time required to complete a job using each machine is given as follows:\n\n- Machine M1 requires 5 hours.\n- Machine M2 requires 7 hours.\n- Machine M3 requires 6 hours.\n\nIf the company has 10 jobs to complete, find the optimal schedule that minimizes the total time required to complete all the jobs assuming only one job can be done at a time on a machine.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total time required to complete all the jobs, we should distribute the jobs among the machines in such a way that the total time taken by each machine is as close as possible to each other. \n\nLet's denote the number of jobs assigned to each machine as J1, J2, and J3 for machines M1, M2, and M3, respectively. Then, the total time taken by each machine can be represented as:\n\n- Time taken by M1 = 5 * J1\n- Time taken by M2 = 7 * J2\n- Time taken by M3 = 6 * J3\n\nSince we have 10 jobs to complete, J1 + J2 + J3 = 10.\n\nNow, let's try different combinations of job assignments to find the optimal schedule:\n\n1. Assign 3 jobs to M1, 3 jobs to M2, and 4 jobs to M3:\n   Time taken by M1 = 5 * 3 = 15 hours\n   Time taken by M2 = 7 * 3 = 21 hours\n   Time taken by M3 = 6 * 4 = 24 hours\n   Total time = 24 hours (since M3 takes the longest)\n\n2. Assign 4 jobs to M1, 3 jobs to M2, and 3 jobs to M3:\n   Time taken by M1 = 5 * 4 = 20 hours\n   Time taken by M2 = 7 * 3 = 21 hours\n   Time taken by M3 = 6 * 3 = 18 hours\n   Total time = 21 hours (since M2 takes the longest)\n\n3. Assign 5 jobs to M1, 2 jobs to M2, and 3 jobs to M3:\n   Time taken by M1 = 5 * 5 = 25 hours\n   Time taken by M2 = 7 * 2 = 14 hours\n   Time taken by M3 = 6 * 3 = 18 hours\n   Total time = 25 hours (since M1 takes the longest)\n\nFrom the above combinations, the optimal schedule is to assign 4 jobs to M1, 3 jobs to M2, and 3 jobs to M3, which results in a total time of 21 hours."
