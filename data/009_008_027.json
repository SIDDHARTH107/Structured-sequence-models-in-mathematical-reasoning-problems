    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem related to wave propagation and wave equations:\n\nA string with a length of 5 meters is fixed at both ends. The speed of the wave along the string is 40 meters/second. Find the frequency of the wave if the fourth harmonic is observed in the string.\n\n(Note: For a vibrating string, the frequency of the nth harmonic is given by f_n = n*v/2L, where v is the speed of the wave and L is the length of the string.)",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the fourth harmonic, we can use the formula f_n = n*v/2L.\n\nIn this case, n = 4 (since it's the fourth harmonic), v = 40 meters/second (the speed of the wave), and L = 5 meters (the length of the string).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nf_4 = (4 * 40) / (2 * 5)\n\nf_4 = 160 / 10\n\nf_4 = 16 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the fourth harmonic is 16 Hz."
