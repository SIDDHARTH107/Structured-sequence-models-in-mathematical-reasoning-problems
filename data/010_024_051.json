    "message_2": "In a hyperbolic plane with constant curvature K, the circumference C of a circle with radius r can be found using the formula:\n\nC = 2π sinh(r/(-K)^(1/2))\n\nGiven the curvature K = -4 and radius r = 3, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nC = 2π sinh(3/(-(-4))^(1/2))\nC = 2π sinh(3/(4^(1/2)))\nC = 2π sinh(3/2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the circumference:\n\nC ≈ 2π * 4.65\nC ≈ 29.22\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle with radius 3 in the hyperbolic plane of curvature -4 is approximately 29.22 units."
