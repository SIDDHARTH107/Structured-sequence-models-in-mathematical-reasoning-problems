    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific numerical problem on statistical inference for you to solve:\n\nIn a group of 50 students taking a math test, the average score is 80 with a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the scores are normally distributed, what is the probability that a random student from this group will score above 90 on the test?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the z-score formula to standardize the score of 90 and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the raw score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 90, μ = 80, and σ = 10.\n\nz = (90 - 80) / 10\nz = 10 / 10\nz = 1\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find the probability. The table gives us the probability of a value being less than the given z-score. Since we want to find the probability of a student scoring above 90, we need to find the probability of a value being greater than z = 1.\n\nP(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z < 1)\n\nLooking up the z-score of 1 in the standard normal distribution table, we find that P(Z < 1) ≈ 0.8413.\n\nP(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413\nP(Z > 1) ≈ 0.1587\n\nSo, the probability that a random student from this group will score above 90 on the test is approximately 15.87%."
