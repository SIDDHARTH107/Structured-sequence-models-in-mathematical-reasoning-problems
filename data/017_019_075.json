    "message_2": "To find the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we first note that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. For a group of order 36, we have 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. Thus, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: There are either 1 or 9 Sylow 2-subgroups (by Sylow's Third Theorem). If there is only 1, it is normal, and we get the semi-direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup with the Sylow 2-subgroup. If there are 9, we need to consider the action of the Sylow 3-subgroup on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: There are either 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. If there is only 1, it is normal, and we get the semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup with the Sylow 3-subgroup. If there are 4, we need to consider the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nNow, we can list the nine non-abelian groups of order 36:\n\n1. (C9 ⋊ C4) ⋊ C2: Here, the Sylow 3-subgroup is C9, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is C4. The semi-direct product is taken with respect to an action of C4 on C9, and then the resulting group is extended by C2.\n\n2. (C9 ⋊ Q8) ⋊ C2: Similar to the first case, but the Sylow 2-subgroup is Q8 (the quaternion group of order 8) instead of C4.\n\n3. C3 ⋊ (C3 ⋊ C4): The Sylow 3-subgroup is C3, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is C4. The semi-direct product is taken with respect to an action of C4 on C3, and then the resulting group is extended by another C3.\n\n4. C3 ⋊ (C3 ⋊ Q8): Similar to the third case, but the Sylow 2-subgroup is Q8 instead of C4.\n\n5. (C3 ⋊ C2) ⋊ C6: The Sylow 3-subgroup is C3, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is C2. The semi-direct product is taken with respect to an action of C2 on C3, and then the resulting group is extended by C6.\n\n6. (C3 ⋊ D4) ⋊ C3: Similar to the fifth case, but the Sylow 2-subgroup is D4 (the dihedral group of order 8) instead of C2.\n\n7. C3 ⋊ (C3 ⋊ D4): The Sylow 3-subgroup is C3, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is D4. The semi-direct product is taken with respect to an action of D4 on C3, and then the resulting group is extended by another C3.\n\n8. C3 ⋊ (C3 ⋊ C2): The Sylow 3-subgroup is C3, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is C2. The semi-direct product is taken with respect to an action of C2 on C3, and then the resulting group is extended by another C3.\n\n9. C3 ⋊ (C3 ⋊ C2^2): The Sylow 3-subgroup is C3, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is C2^2. The semi-direct product is taken with respect to an action of C2^2 on C3, and then the resulting group is extended by another C3.\n\nThese are the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
