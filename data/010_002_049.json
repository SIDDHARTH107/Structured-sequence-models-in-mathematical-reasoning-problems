Let's consider the sequence {1, 2, 3} and check if it converges to each point in X.\n\nA sequence {x_n} converges to a point x in a topological space if for every open neighborhood U of x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N, x_n ∈ U.\n\n1. Convergence to point 1:\n\nLet U be an open neighborhood of 1. Since we have the discrete topology, {1} is an open set containing 1. Thus, we can choose U = {1}. The sequence {1, 2, 3} has the first term equal to 1, so we can choose N = 1. For all n ≥ 1, the sequence is not always in U, as the terms 2 and 3 are not in U. Therefore, the sequence does not converge to point 1.\n\n2. Convergence to point 2:\n\nLet U be an open neighborhood of 2. We can choose U = {2}. The sequence {1, 2, 3} has the second term equal to 2, so we can choose N = 2. For all n ≥ 2, the sequence is not always in U, as the terms 1 and 3 are not in U. Therefore, the sequence does not converge to point 2.\n\n3. Convergence to point 3:\n\nLet U be an open neighborhood of 3. We can choose U = {3}. The sequence {1, 2, 3} has the third term equal to 3, so we can choose N = 3. For all n ≥ 3, the sequence is not always in U, as the terms 1 and 2 are not in U. Therefore, the sequence does not converge to point 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the sequence {1, 2, 3} does not converge to any point in the topological space X with the discrete topology."
