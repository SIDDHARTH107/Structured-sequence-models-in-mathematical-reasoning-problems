    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system in matrix form. The matrix form of the given system is AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 8 -5  2 |\n    | 6  9 -3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  10  |\n    | -24  |\n    |  27  |\n\nNow, we can use the sparse matrix representation to store only the non-zero elements of the matrix A along with their row and column indices.\n\nSparse matrix representation of A:\nValue:  [2, 3, 4, 8, -5, 2, 6, 9, -3]\nRow:    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nColumn: [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\nNext, we can solve the system of linear equations using any method, such as Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or the inverse matrix method. Here, we will use the inverse matrix method.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv). Then, we can find the solution matrix X by multiplying A_inv with B: X = A_inv * B.\n\nUsing a calculator or software to find the inverse of matrix A, we get:\n\nA_inv = |  1/3  -1/3  -2/3 |\n        | -2/3   1/3   4/3 |\n        |  1/3   1/3  -1/3 |\n\nNow, we can multiply A_inv with B:\n\nX = A_inv * B = |  1/3  -1/3  -2/3 | * |  10  |\n                | -2/3   1/3   4/3 |   | -24  |\n                |  1/3   1/3  -1/3 |   |  27  |\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n    | 3 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
