    "message_2": "To find the length of the closed curve C, we first need to find the equation of the curve C. Since C is the intersection of the surface S with the plane z = 1/2, we can substitute z = 1/2 into the equation of S:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + 1/4 = 1\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 3/4\n\nThis is the equation of a circle with radius √(3/4) in the xy-plane. To find the length (circumference) of the closed curve C, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle:\n\nC = 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle. In this case, r = √(3/4), so the circumference is:\n\nC = 2π√(3/4)\n\nC = 2π(√3/2)\n\nC = π√3\n\nSo, the length of the closed curve C is π√3."
