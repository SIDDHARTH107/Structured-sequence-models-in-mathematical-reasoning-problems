    "message_2": "A group of prime order 7 is a cyclic group, denoted as Z_7. The generator of this group is an element that can generate all other elements of the group through its powers. In this case, the generators of Z_7 are 3 and 5, as they have the highest order (7) in the group.\n\nLet's choose the generator g = 3. The other elements of the group can be found by taking the powers of the generator modulo 7:\n\n1. 3^1 mod 7 = 3\n2. 3^2 mod 7 = 9 mod 7 = 2\n3. 3^3 mod 7 = 27 mod 7 = 6\n4. 3^4 mod 7 = 81 mod 7 = 4\n5. 3^5 mod 7 = 243 mod 7 = 5\n6. 3^6 mod 7 = 729 mod 7 = 1\n\nSo, the elements of the group Z_7 with generator 3 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}."
