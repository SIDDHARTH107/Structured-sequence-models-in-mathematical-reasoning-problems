    "message_1": "Suppose there are 6 people at a party. What is the minimum number of handshakes that must occur such that there are either 3 people who have all shaken hands with each other or 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. We will represent the people at the party as vertices of a graph, and a handshake between two people as an edge connecting the corresponding vertices.\n\nConsider one person, say person A. There are 5 other people at the party, so person A can either shake hands with them or not shake hands with them. Therefore, person A has 2 possibilities for each of the 5 other people: either shaking hands or not shaking hands.\n\nNow, let's divide the 5 other people into two groups: those who shook hands with person A (group H) and those who did not shake hands with person A (group N). Since there are 2 possibilities for each of the 5 people, there must be at least 3 people in either group H or group N (by the Pigeonhole Principle).\n\nCase 1: There are at least 3 people in group H.\nIf any two of these 3 people shook hands with each other, then we have a group of 3 people who have all shaken hands with each other (including person A). If none of these 3 people shook hands with each other, then we have a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other.\n\nCase 2: There are at least 3 people in group N.\nThese 3 people have not shaken hands with person A. If any two of these 3 people shook hands with each other, then we have a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other (since they didn't shake hands with person A). If none of these 3 people shook hands with each other, then we have a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other.\n\nIn both cases, we have either 3 people who have all shaken hands with each other or 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other. Therefore, the minimum number of handshakes that must occur is 0, as it is possible that no handshakes occur and we still satisfy the condition."
