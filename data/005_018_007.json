    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nSuppose a hospital wants to analyze the survival time of patients with a certain disease. They collect data on 100 patients and find that the mean survival time is 40 weeks with a standard deviation of 12 weeks. Assuming survival times follow a normal distribution, what is the probability that a randomly chosen patient from this group survives for less than 26 weeks?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the survival time and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize (in this case, 26 weeks), μ is the mean (40 weeks), and σ is the standard deviation (12 weeks).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (26 - 40) / 12\nz = -14 / 12\nz = -1.167\n\nNow, we can use the z-table to find the probability that a randomly chosen patient survives for less than 26 weeks. Look up the value -1.167 in the z-table, and we find the corresponding probability to be approximately 0.1217.\n\nSo, there is a 12.17% chance that a randomly chosen patient from this group survives for less than 26 weeks."
