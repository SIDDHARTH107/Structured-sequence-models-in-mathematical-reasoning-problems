    "message_2": "The Wave Equation is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$$\n\nwhere $c$ is the speed of the wave, and $u(x,t)$ is the function describing the wave. In this case, $u(x,t) = e^{-t}\\cos(x)$. We need to find the second partial derivatives with respect to $t$ and $x$.\n\nFirst, let's find the second partial derivative with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -e^{-t}\\cos(x)$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = e^{-t}\\cos(x)$$\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = -e^{-t}\\sin(x)$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = -e^{-t}\\cos(x)$$\n\nNow, we can plug these into the Wave Equation:\n\n$$e^{-t}\\cos(x) = c^2 (-e^{-t}\\cos(x))$$\n\nSince $e^{-t}\\cos(x)$ is nonzero, we can divide both sides by it:\n\n$$1 = -c^2$$\n\nThis equation has no real solutions for $c$, which means that the given function $u(x,t)$ does not represent a wave traveling along the wire with a real speed."
