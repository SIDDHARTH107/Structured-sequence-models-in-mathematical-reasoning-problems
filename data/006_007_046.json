    "message_2": "To find the expected change in price of the stock, we can use the formula for expected value:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of Outcome 1 × Value of Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 × Value of Outcome 2)\n\nIn this case, Outcome 1 is the stock increasing in price by $10, and Outcome 2 is the stock decreasing in price by $5.\n\nExpected Value = (0.5 × $10) + (0.5 × -$5)\nExpected Value = ($5) + (-$2.50)\nExpected Value = $2.50\n\nThe expected change in price of the stock is $2.50."
