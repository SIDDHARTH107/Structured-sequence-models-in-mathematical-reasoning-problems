    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color a graph G with 14 vertices and 23 edges such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we can use the concept of graph coloring and the chromatic number.\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. It is denoted by χ(G).\n\nOne of the key factors that influence the chromatic number of a graph is its maximum degree, which is the highest degree of any vertex in the graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\nAccording to Brooks' theorem, for any connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most equal to the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph.\n\nSince we don't have information about the specific connections between the vertices, we can't determine the exact chromatic number. However, we can find an upper bound for the chromatic number using the maximum degree.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph would have a vertex with a degree of 23/14 ≈ 1.64. Since the degree must be an integer, we round it up to 2. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) is 2.\n\nAccording to Brooks' theorem, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most equal to the maximum degree Δ(G), which is 2 in this case. So, the minimum number of colors required to color the graph G with 14 vertices and 23 edges such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 2."
