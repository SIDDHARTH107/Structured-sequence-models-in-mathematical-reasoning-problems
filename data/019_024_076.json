    "message_2": "To solve for x and y, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 30 + 10\n2x = 40\n\nNow, divide by 2 to find the value of x:\n\n2x / 2 = 40 / 2\nx = 20\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation to find the value of y. We'll use the first equation:\n\nx + y = 30\n20 + y = 30\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\ny = 30 - 20\ny = 10\n\nSo, the values of x and y are x = 20 and y = 10."
