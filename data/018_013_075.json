However, this does not show that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative with respect to union, because we are not comparing the results of two different operations involving the Cartesian product and union. Associativity refers to the property that the order of operations does not matter, i.e., (A ∗ B) ∗ C = A ∗ (B ∗ C), where ∗ is an operation. In this case, we are simply computing the union of the Cartesian product with another set and the Cartesian product of two sets, which does not involve the associativity property."
