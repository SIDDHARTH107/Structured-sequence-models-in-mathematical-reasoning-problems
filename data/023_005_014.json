    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' - 4y = cos(2t) with initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0 using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation.\n\nLet Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t) and F(ω) be the Fourier transform of cos(2t). Then, the Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\n(-ω^2)Y(ω) - 4Y(ω) = F(ω)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of cos(2t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[cos(2t) * e^(-iωt)] dt from -∞ to ∞\n\nThe Fourier transform of cos(2t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Fourier transform of the differential equation as:\n\nY(ω) = F(ω) / (-ω^2 - 4)\n\nSubstitute F(ω) into the equation:\n\nY(ω) = π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] / (-ω^2 - 4)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get y(t):\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) ∫[Y(ω) * e^(iωt)] dω from -∞ to ∞\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) ∫[π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] / (-ω^2 - 4) * e^(iωt)] dω from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can use the properties of the Dirac delta function to evaluate the integral:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) [∫[πδ(ω - 2) / (-ω^2 - 4) * e^(iωt)] dω + ∫[πδ(ω + 2) / (-ω^2 - 4) * e^(iωt)] dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) [π * e^(2it) / (-4) + π * e^(-2it) / (-4)]\n\ny(t) = (1 / 8) [e^(2it) + e^(-2it)]\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite y(t) in terms of cosines:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 8) [2 * cos(2t)]\n\ny(t) = (1 / 4) cos(2t)\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0:\n\ny(0) = (1 / 4) cos(0) = 1 / 4\n\ny'(t) = -(1 / 2) sin(2t)\n\ny'(0) = -(1 / 2) sin(0) = 0\n\nSince the initial conditions are not satisfied, we need to add a particular solution to the general solution:\n\ny_p(t) = A\n\ny(t) = (1 / 4) cos(2t) + A\n\nNow, apply the initial conditions again:\n\ny(0) = (1 / 4) cos(0) + A = 1\n\nA = 3 / 4\n\nSo, the final solution to the given differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 4) cos(2t) + 3 / 4"
