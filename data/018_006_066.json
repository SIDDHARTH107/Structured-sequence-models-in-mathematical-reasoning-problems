    "message_1": "Let A be a set with a universal set U such that U contains 50 elements. If A has 20 elements, how many elements does A' (complement of A) have? Prove that the union of A and A' is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "Since A is a subset of the universal set U, the complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in U that are not in A. \n\nGiven that A has 20 elements and U has 50 elements, there are 50 - 20 = 30 elements in A'. \n\nNow, we need to prove that the union of A and A' is equal to U. \n\nBy definition, the union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In this case, we are considering the union of A and A'. \n\nSince A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A, the union of A and A' will include all elements in A and all elements in A', which together account for all elements in U. \n\nTherefore, A ∪ A' = U.\n\nIn conclusion, the complement of A, A', has 30 elements, and the union of A and A' is equal to the universal set U."
