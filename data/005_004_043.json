    "message_1": "Suppose you want to compare the average monthly salary of three different professions: doctors, lawyers, and engineers. You collect the following data:\n\n- The average monthly salary of 20 doctors is $10,000 with a standard deviation of $1,000.\n- The average monthly salary of 25 lawyers is $8,000 with a standard deviation of $1,500.\n- The average monthly salary of 15 engineers is $7,500 with a standard deviation of $800.\n\nUsing ANOVA, determine if there is a significant difference in the average monthly salaries between the three professions at a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we need to calculate the following values:\n\n1. Total number of samples (N)\n2. Degrees of freedom between groups (df_between)\n3. Degrees of freedom within groups (df_within)\n4. Sum of squares between groups (SS_between)\n5. Sum of squares within groups (SS_within)\n6. Mean square between groups (MS_between)\n7. Mean square within groups (MS_within)\n8. F-statistic (F)\n9. P-value\n\nLet's calculate these values step by step:\n\n1. Total number of samples (N):\nN = 20 (doctors) + 25 (lawyers) + 15 (engineers) = 60\n\n2. Degrees of freedom between groups (df_between):\ndf_between = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 (where k is the number of groups)\n\n3. Degrees of freedom within groups (df_within):\ndf_within = N - k = 60 - 3 = 57\n\n4. Sum of squares between groups (SS_between):\nFirst, we need to calculate the grand mean (GM):\nGM = (ΣX) / N = (20 * 10,000 + 25 * 8,000 + 15 * 7,500) / 60 = 200,000 + 200,000 + 112,500 / 60 = 512,500 / 60 = 8,541.67\n\nNow, we can calculate SS_between:\nSS_between = Σn * (mean_i - GM)^2\n= 20 * (10,000 - 8,541.67)^2 + 25 * (8,000 - 8,541.67)^2 + 15 * (7,500 - 8,541.67)^2\n= 20 * 2,131,944.44 + 25 * 292,361.11 + 15 * 1,084,027.78\n= 42,638,888.80 + 7,309,027.78 + 16,260,416.70\n= 66,208,333.28\n\n5. Sum of squares within groups (SS_within):\nSS_within = Σ(df_i * variance_i) = (20 - 1) * 1,000^2 + (25 - 1) * 1,500^2 + (15 - 1) * 800^2\n= 19 * 1,000,000 + 24 * 2,250,000 + 14 * 640,000\n= 19,000,000 + 54,000,000 + 8,960,000\n= 81,960,000\n\n6. Mean square between groups (MS_between):\nMS_between = SS_between / df_between = 66,208,333.28 / 2 = 33,104,166.64\n\n7. Mean square within groups (MS_within):\nMS_within = SS_within / df_within = 81,960,000 / 57 = 1,437,894.74\n\n8. F-statistic (F):\nF = MS_between / MS_within = 33,104,166.64 / 1,437,894.74 = 23.02\n\n9. P-value:\nUsing an F-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical F-value for df_between = 2 and df_within = 57 at a 5% level of significance is approximately 3.15.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (23.02) is greater than the critical F-value (3.15), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the average monthly salaries between the three professions. Therefore, there is a significant difference in the average monthly salaries of doctors, lawyers, and engineers at a 5% level of significance."
