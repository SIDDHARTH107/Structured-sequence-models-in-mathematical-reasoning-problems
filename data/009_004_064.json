    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a problem:\n\nA spring has a mass of 0.5 kg attached to it. The spring is stretched 0.2 meters from its equilibrium position and released from rest. The resulting oscillation of the system is characterized by the differential equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 16x = 0$$\n\nWhere $x$ is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position in meters.\n\nWhat is the frequency of the resulting oscillation?",
    "message_2": "The given differential equation is a simple harmonic motion equation of the form:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\omega^2x = 0$$\n\nWhere $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation. In this case, we have $\\omega^2 = 16$, so $\\omega = 4$ rad/s.\n\nThe frequency $f$ of the oscillation is related to the angular frequency by the equation:\n\n$$f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\omega$:\n\n$$f = \\frac{4}{2\\pi} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\approx 0.6366 \\text{ Hz}$$\n\nSo, the frequency of the resulting oscillation is approximately 0.6366 Hz."
