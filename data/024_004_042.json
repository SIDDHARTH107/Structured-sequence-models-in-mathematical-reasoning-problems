    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of a cylindrical surface, we need to calculate the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) first. For a cylinder, one of the principal curvatures (k1) is always 0, as there is no curvature along the length of the cylinder. The other principal curvature (k2) is the reciprocal of the radius of the cylinder.\n\nk1 = 0\nk2 = 1/radius\n\nGiven the radius of the cylinder is 4 cm:\n\nk2 = 1/4\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature (H) using the formula:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nH = (0 + 1/4) / 2\nH = (1/4) / 2\nH = 1/8\n\nThe mean curvature of the surface at any point on the cylinder is 1/8 cm^(-1)."
