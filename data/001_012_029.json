    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 4x^2 - 6x\nFactor out the common term 2x:\n2x(2x - 3)\n\nDenominator: 2x^2 - 8x\nFactor out the common term 2x:\n2x(x - 4)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(2x(2x - 3)) / (2x(x - 4))\n\nSince 2x is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(2x - 3) / (x - 4)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(2x - 3) / (x - 4)"
