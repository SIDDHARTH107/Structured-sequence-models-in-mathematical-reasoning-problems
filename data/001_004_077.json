    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial 2x^2 + 3x - 9, we can use the \"ac method.\"\n\n1. Multiply the coefficient of x^2 (which is 2) by the constant term (which is -9). So, 2 * -9 = -18.\n\n2. Find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to the coefficient of x (which is 3). These two numbers are 6 and -3, since 6 * -3 = -18 and 6 + (-3) = 3.\n\n3. Rewrite the middle term (3x) as the sum of the two numbers found in step 2: 2x^2 + 6x - 3x - 9.\n\n4. Factor by grouping:\n   - Group the first two terms and the last two terms: (2x^2 + 6x) + (-3x - 9).\n   - Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group: 2x(x + 3) - 3(x + 3).\n\n5. Notice that both terms have a common factor of (x + 3). Factor this out: (2x - 3)(x + 3).\n\nSo, the factored form of the quadratic polynomial 2x^2 + 3x - 9 is (2x - 3)(x + 3)."
