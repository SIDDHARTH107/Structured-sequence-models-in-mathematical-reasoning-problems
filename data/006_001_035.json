    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 7 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads)\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips)\n- k is the number of successes (heads)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial\n\nIn this problem, n = 7, k = 4, p = 1/2 (since it's a fair coin), and q = 1/2.\n\nFirst, let's find nCk (7 choose 4):\n\nnCk = C(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7-4)!)\n           = 7! / (4! * 3!)\n           = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n           = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n           = 35\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = (35) * (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^(7-4)\n        = 35 * (1/16) * (1/8)\n        = 35 * (1/128)\n        = 35/128\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 7 coin flips is 35/128 or approximately 0.2734."
