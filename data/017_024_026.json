    "message_1": "What is the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96 and what are their respective structures?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of partitions for each prime factor's exponent: P(5) = 3 and P(1) = 1\n3. Calculate the number of abelian groups using the formula: A(96) = P(5) * P(1) = 3 * 1 = 3\n4. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups: G(96) = (G(2^5) * G(3^1)) / A(96) = (7 * 2) / 3 = 14 / 3\n\nSince the result is not an integer, we need to refine our approach. We can use the fact that a group of order 96 can be expressed as a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. The Sylow theorems give us information about the possible number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, the number of subgroups can be 1, 3, or 15. However, since the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide 3^1 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, there must be exactly one 2-Sylow subgroup, which is normal.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, the number of subgroups can be 1 or 32. Since the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide 2^5 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, there must be exactly one 3-Sylow subgroup, which is also normal.\n\nSince both Sylow subgroups are normal, the group of order 96 is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. There are 7 groups of order 2^5 and 2 groups of order 3^1. Thus, there are 7 * 2 = 14 non-isomorphic groups of order 96.\n\nThe respective structures of these groups can be described as follows:\n\n1. C_2^5 x C_3\n2. C_2^4 x C_3 x C_2\n3. C_2^3 x C_3 x C_4\n4. C_2^2 x C_3 x C_8\n5. C_2 x C_3 x C_16\n6. C_3 x D_16\n7. C_3 x Q_16\n8. C_2^3 x C_3 x C_2^2\n9. C_2^2 x C_3 x C_2^3\n10. C_2 x C_3 x C_2^4\n11. C_3 x (C_2 x D_8)\n12. C_3 x (C_2 x Q_8)\n13. C_3 x (C_2^2 x D_4)\n14. C_3 x (C_2^2 x Q_4)\n\nHere, C_n denotes a cyclic group of order n, D_n denotes a dihedral group of order 2n, and Q_n denotes a generalized quaternion group of order n."
