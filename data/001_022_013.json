    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 16, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0.\n\nSo, we need to solve the equation:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 16 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it can be challenging to solve directly. One approach is to try factoring the equation or using synthetic division to find a potential root. If we can find one root, we can then reduce the equation to a quadratic equation and solve for the remaining roots.\n\nLet's try factoring by grouping:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 16 = 0\n\nGroup the terms:\n\n(x^3 - 4x^2) + (-4x + 16) = 0\n\nFactor out the common factors:\n\nx^2(x - 4) - 4(x - 4) = 0\n\nNow, we can see that both terms have a common factor of (x - 4):\n\n(x^2 - 4)(x - 4) = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic factor (x^2 - 4) and a linear factor (x - 4). The quadratic factor can be factored further as it is a difference of squares:\n\n(x + 2)(x - 2)(x - 4) = 0\n\nNow we have three linear factors. To find the x-intercepts, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx - 4 = 0 => x = 4\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 16 are x = -2, x = 2, and x = 4."
