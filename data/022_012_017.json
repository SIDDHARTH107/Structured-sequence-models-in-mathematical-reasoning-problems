    "message_2": "To find the poles of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator of the function is equal to zero. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (± √(-4)) / 2\n\nz = ± i\n\nSo, the poles of f(z) are z = i and z = -i.\n\nNow, we need to find the order of these poles. The order of a pole is the number of times it appears as a root of the denominator. In this case, the denominator is a quadratic equation, and each pole appears only once as a root. Therefore, the order of both poles is 1.\n\nFinally, we need to determine if f(z) is meromorphic on the entire complex plane. A function is meromorphic if it is holomorphic (analytic) everywhere except for its poles. Since f(z) is a rational function (a ratio of two polynomials), it is holomorphic everywhere except for its poles. Therefore, f(z) is meromorphic on the entire complex plane."
