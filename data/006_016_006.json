    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring is 0.03. If a sample of 500 products is taken, what is the probability that at least 10 products will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, n is the sample size (500 in this case), p is the probability of a defect occurring (0.03), and k is the number of defective products.\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 10 defective products, so we need to find the complement of the probability of having fewer than 10 defective products and then subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 9 and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ [C(500, k) * (0.03)^k * (0.97)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.0347\n\nNow, subtract this value from 1 to find the probability of at least 10 defective products:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.0347 ≈ 0.9653\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 products will have this type of defect in a sample of 500 products is approximately 0.9653 or 96.53%."
