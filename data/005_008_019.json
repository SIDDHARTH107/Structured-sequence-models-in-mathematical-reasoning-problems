Here's a problem for the student to solve:\n\nThe daily sales data for a grocery store for the past week (7 days) are as follows:\n\nDay 1: 120\nDay 2: 130\nDay 3: 135\nDay 4: 124\nDay 5: 128\nDay 6: 131\nDay 7: 140\n\nFind the following time series statistics:\na) Mean\nb) Median\nc) Mode\nd) Range\ne) Variance\nf) Standard deviation\n\nProvide your answers as rounded to 2 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "a) Mean:\nTo find the mean, add up all the daily sales and divide by the number of days (7).\n\nMean = (120 + 130 + 135 + 124 + 128 + 131 + 140) / 7\nMean = 908 / 7\nMean ≈ 129.71\n\nb) Median:\nTo find the median, first arrange the data in ascending order and then find the middle value.\n\nSorted data: 120, 124, 128, 130, 131, 135, 140\nMedian = 130 (since there are 7 data points, the middle value is the 4th value)\n\nc) Mode:\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. In this case, there is no mode since all values are unique.\n\nd) Range:\nThe range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set.\n\nRange = 140 - 120\nRange = 20\n\ne) Variance:\nTo find the variance, first find the mean (already calculated as 129.71), then subtract the mean from each data point, square the result, and find the average of those squared differences.\n\nVariance = [(120-129.71)^2 + (130-129.71)^2 + (135-129.71)^2 + (124-129.71)^2 + (128-129.71)^2 + (131-129.71)^2 + (140-129.71)^2] / 7\nVariance ≈ 47.96\n\nf) Standard deviation:\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\nStandard deviation ≈ √47.96\nStandard deviation ≈ 6.92\n\nSo, the answers are:\na) Mean: 129.71\nb) Median: 130\nc) Mode: None\nd) Range: 20\ne) Variance: 47.96\nf) Standard deviation: 6.92"
