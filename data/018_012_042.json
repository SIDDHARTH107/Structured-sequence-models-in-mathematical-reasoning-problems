    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product AxB:\n\nAxB = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow let's calculate (AxB) ∩ B. Since B contains single elements and AxB contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty:\n\n(AxB) ∩ B = ∅\n\nNext, let's find B ∩ B. Since B is a set of unique elements, its intersection with itself is the same set:\n\nB ∩ B = B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow let's calculate A x (B ∩ B), which is the same as A x B:\n\nA x (B ∩ B) = A x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow we can see that:\n\n(AxB) ∩ B = ∅\nA x (B ∩ B) = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nSince (AxB) ∩ B ≠ A x (B ∩ B), the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
