    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 24, we first consider the prime factorization of 24, which is 2^3 * 3. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their properties.\n\nLet G be a group of order 24. By Sylow's first theorem, G has Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. Let n_2 and n_3 denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, respectively.\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, n_2 must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 3. Similarly, n_3 must divide 8 (2^3) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nNow we analyze the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. The intersection of P_2 and P_3 is trivial, so G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 is abelian (all groups of order 8 are abelian), this case does not give us a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. The Sylow 2-subgroups are not unique, so they are not normal. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8. Since P_3 is normal in G, we can form the semi-direct product P_2 ⋊ P_3. \n\nThere are two non-abelian groups of order 8, namely the dihedral group D_4 and the quaternion group Q_8. Thus, we have two possible semi-direct products: D_4 ⋊ Z_3 and Q_8 ⋊ Z_3. We need to check if these semi-direct products are non-abelian and non-isomorphic.\n\nD_4 ⋊ Z_3 is non-abelian because D_4 is non-abelian. Q_8 ⋊ Z_3 is also non-abelian because Q_8 is non-abelian. To show that they are not isomorphic, we can consider their center. The center of D_4 ⋊ Z_3 is trivial, while the center of Q_8 ⋊ Z_3 has order 2 (it contains the element (-1, 0), where -1 is the central element of Q_8). Since their centers have different orders, they are not isomorphic.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8, which is normal in G. The Sylow 3-subgroups are not unique, so they are not normal. However, since P_2 is normal and abelian, any semi-direct product with P_2 will also be abelian. Thus, this case does not give us a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are unique or normal. Thus, G cannot be a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and this case does not give us a non-abelian group.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two non-abelian groups of order 24, namely D_4 ⋊ Z_3 and Q_8 ⋊ Z_3. Any group of order 24 must have Sylow subgroups with the properties analyzed in the cases above, so it must be isomorphic to one of these two groups or an abelian group of order 24."
