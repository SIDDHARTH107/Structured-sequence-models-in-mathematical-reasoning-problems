    "message_1": "Suppose you have a linear logic circuit with 4 inputs and 2 outputs. How many possible combinations of input values are there that the circuit can process to produce a unique output?",
    "message_2": "A linear logic circuit with 4 inputs can have each input either in the state 0 (off) or 1 (on). Since there are 2 possible states for each input, and there are 4 inputs, the total number of possible combinations of input values is:\n\n2^4 = 16\n\nSo there are 16 possible combinations of input values that the circuit can process to produce a unique output."
