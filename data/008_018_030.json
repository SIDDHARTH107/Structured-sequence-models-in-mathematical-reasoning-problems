    "message_2": "To use the block matrix method, we first write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n[2  5  3] [x]   [20]\n[4  9  5] [y] = [35]\n[6 13  7] [z]   [50]\n\nNow, we can partition the matrix into blocks:\n\n[A | B] [X] = [C]\nwhere A = [2  5] , B = [3] , X = [x] , and C = [20]\n          [4  9]       [5]       [y]         [35]\n          [6 13]       [7]       [z]         [50]\n\nNow, we can solve for Y by multiplying both sides by the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) * (A * X + B * Y) = A^(-1) * C\n\nFirst, we find the inverse of A:\n\nA = [2  5]\n    [4  9]\n    [6 13]\n\nTo find the inverse of A, we can use the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = 1/|A| * adj(A)\n\nwhere |A| is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\n|A| = (2*9 - 5*4) = 18 - 20 = -2\n\nadj(A) = [ 13 -9]\n         [-6  2]\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = 1/(-2) * [ 13 -9]\n                  [-6  2]\n\nA^(-1) = [-6.5  4.5]\n         [ 3   -1 ]\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) * (A * X + B * Y) = A^(-1) * C\n\n[-6.5  4.5] [X] + [-6.5  4.5] [3] [Y] = [-6.5  4.5] [20]\n[ 3   -1 ] [Y]   [ 3   -1 ] [5] [Z]   [ 3   -1 ] [35]\n                            [7]       [50]\n\nNow, we can perform the matrix multiplication:\n\n[-6.5  4.5] [X] + [-6.5  4.5] [3] [Y] = [-6.5  4.5] [20]\n[ 3   -1 ] [Y]   [ 3   -1 ] [5] [Z]   [ 3   -1 ] [35]\n                            [7]       [50]\n\n[-6.5  4.5] [X] + [-19.5  13.5] [Y] = [-130  90]\n[ 3   -1 ] [Y]   [  9    -7 ] [Z]   [  60 -35]\n                            [7]       [50]\n\nNow, we have a new system of linear equations:\n\n-6.5X + 4.5Y - 19.5 = -130\n3X - Y + 9 = 60\n13.5Y - 7Z = 90\n-1Y - 7 = -35\n\nNow, we can solve this system of linear equations using substitution or elimination method:\n\nFrom the second equation, we get Y = 3X - 51\nSubstitute this into the first equation:\n\n-6.5X + 4.5(3X - 51) - 19.5 = -130\n-6.5X + 13.5X - 229.5 - 19.5 = -130\n7X = 119\nX = 17\n\nNow, substitute the value of X into the equation for Y:\n\nY = 3(17) - 51\nY = 51 - 51\nY = 0\n\nNow, substitute the values of X and Y into the equation for Z:\n\n13.5(0) - 7Z = 90\n-7Z = 90\nZ = -90/7\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 17\ny = 0\nz = -90/7"
