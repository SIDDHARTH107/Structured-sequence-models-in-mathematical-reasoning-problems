    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible keys for a block cipher with a 64-bit block size, we need to know the key size. The block size refers to the size of the data being encrypted, while the key size determines the number of possible keys.\n\nFor example, if the key size is 128 bits, then there would be 2^128 possible keys. Without knowing the key size, we cannot determine the number of possible keys for the block cipher."
