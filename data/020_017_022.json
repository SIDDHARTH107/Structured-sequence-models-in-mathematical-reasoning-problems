    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 over the interval [0, 4], we can use calculus. First, we find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 2x + 3)\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 2\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - 2 = 0\n\n2x = 2\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, we have one critical point at x = 1. Now, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 4] as well as the critical point to determine the maximum value of the function.\n\nf(0) = (0)^2 - 2(0) + 3 = 3\nf(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 3 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^2 - 2(4) + 3 = 11\n\nThe maximum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 over the interval [0, 4] is 11, which occurs at x = 4."
