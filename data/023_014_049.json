    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x) = e^(-x^2), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform provided in the hint:\n\nF(k) = 1/(2π)^(1/2) ∫ψ(x) e^(-ikx)dx\n\nIn this case, ψ(x) = e^(-x^2), so we have:\n\nF(k) = 1/(2π)^(1/2) ∫e^(-x^2) e^(-ikx)dx\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = 1/(2π)^(1/2) ∫e^(-x^2 - ikx)dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we will complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-x^2 - ikx = -(x^2 + ikx) = -(x + (ik/2))^2 + (k^2/4)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the integral:\n\nF(k) = 1/(2π)^(1/2) ∫e^(-(x + (ik/2))^2 + (k^2/4))dx\n\nNow, we can use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫e^(-ax^2)dx = (π/a)^(1/2)\n\nIn our case, a = 1, so the Gaussian integral formula simplifies to:\n\n∫e^(-x^2)dx = (π)^(1/2)\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: u = x + (ik/2). Then, du = dx, and the limits of integration remain the same (from -∞ to ∞) since the substitution does not affect the limits.\n\nF(k) = 1/(2π)^(1/2) ∫e^(-u^2 + (k^2/4))du\n\nNow, we can separate the integral into two parts:\n\nF(k) = 1/(2π)^(1/2) [∫e^(-u^2)du * e^(k^2/4)]\n\nWe already know the value of the Gaussian integral:\n\nF(k) = 1/(2π)^(1/2) [(π)^(1/2) * e^(k^2/4)]\n\nFinally, simplify the expression:\n\nF(k) = e^(k^2/4) / (2π)^(1/2)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x) = e^(-x^2) is:\n\nF(k) = e^(k^2/4) / (2π)^(1/2)"
