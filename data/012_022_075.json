In other words, what is the smallest number of vertices that a graph can have such that there either exists a triangle (a three-vertex clique) or a four-vertex independent set (a four-vertex subset of vertices with no edges between them)?",
    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3, 4) is the smallest number of vertices in a graph such that there either exists a triangle (a three-vertex clique) or a four-vertex independent set (a four-vertex subset of vertices with no edges between them). \n\nTo find R(3, 4), we can use the recursive formula for Ramsey numbers: R(m, n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1) - 1, with the base cases R(1, n) = n and R(m, 1) = m.\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate R(3, 4) as follows:\n\nR(3, 4) = R(2, 4) + R(3, 3) - 1\nR(2, 4) = R(1, 4) + R(2, 3) - 1 = 4 + R(1, 3) + R(2, 2) - 1 - 1 = 4 + 3 + 2 - 1 - 1 = 7\nR(3, 3) = R(2, 3) + R(3, 2) - 1 = R(1, 3) + R(2, 2) - 1 + R(2, 2) - 1 = 3 + 2 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 5\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the original equation:\n\nR(3, 4) = R(2, 4) + R(3, 3) - 1 = 7 + 5 - 1 = 11\n\nTherefore, the Ramsey number R(3, 4) is 11. This means that in a graph with 11 vertices, there must either be a triangle (a three-vertex clique) or a four-vertex independent set (a four-vertex subset of vertices with no edges between them)."
