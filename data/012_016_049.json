    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we can use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-e; x, y) + T(G*e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G/e; x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G-e; x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nHere, G is the graph, e is an edge, G-e is the graph without edge e, G*e is the graph with edge e contracted, and G/e is the graph with edge e contracted and the resulting loop removed.\n\nThe given graph G has no loops, so we only need to consider the first two cases. We can start by selecting an edge, say {1,2}, and apply the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-{1,2}; x, y) + T(G*{1,2}; x, y)\n\nG-{1,2} has the following edges: {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {3,5}, {4,5}\nG*{1,2} has the following vertices: 1, 3, 4, 5 and edges: {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,5}, {3,5}, {4,5}\n\nNow we can apply the recursive formula again for both T(G-{1,2}; x, y) and T(G*{1,2}; x, y). We can continue this process until we reach graphs with no edges or graphs with only bridges. Then, we can use the base cases to compute the Tutte polynomial for those simpler graphs and work our way back up.\n\nAfter applying the recursive formula and simplifying, we obtain the Tutte polynomial for the given graph:\n\nT(G; x, y) = x^2 * y^3 + x * y^4 + x^3 * y^2 + x^2 * y^2 + x * y^3 + x^2 * y + x * y^2 + y^3\n\nThis is the Tutte polynomial for the given graph."
