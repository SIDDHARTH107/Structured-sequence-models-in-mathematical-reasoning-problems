    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will make the coefficients of y the same in both equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4:\n\n(2x + 4y) * 3 = 12 * 3\n(4x + 3y) * 4 = 15 * 4\n\nWhich results in:\n\n6x + 12y = 36\n16x + 12y = 60\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(16x + 12y) - (6x + 12y) = 60 - 36\n16x - 6x = 24\n10x = 24\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 24 / 10\nx = 2.4\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 4y = 12\n2(2.4) + 4y = 12\n4.8 + 4y = 12\n\nSubtract 4.8 from both sides:\n\n4y = 7.2\n\nNow, divide by 4 to solve for y:\n\ny = 7.2 / 4\ny = 1.8\n\nSo, the solution for the system of equations is x = 2.4 and y = 1.8."
