    "message_2": "Let's consider the torus as a flat rectangular surface with opposite edges identified. The knot K can be represented as a closed curve on this surface. Since the knot intersects itself n times, it divides the torus into n+2 regions (by the Jordan curve theorem for the torus).\n\nNow, let's consider cutting the torus into line segments without cutting the knot. Each cut will either start and end at the boundary of the torus or start and end on the knot. In either case, each cut will separate two regions.\n\nLet's denote the number of cuts as m. Since each cut separates two regions, we have:\n\nnumber of regions = initial regions + separated regions\nn + 2 = 1 + 2m\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\nm = (n + 1)/2\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of line segments you can cut the torus into without cutting the knot, in terms of n, is (n + 1)/2."
