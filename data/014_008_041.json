    "message_1": "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) uses a 128-bit block size. Suppose that you want to encrypt a message that is exactly 155 bytes long. How many blocks of plaintext will there be?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of blocks needed to encrypt a 155-byte message using AES with a 128-bit block size, we first need to convert the block size to bytes. Since there are 8 bits in a byte, we divide 128 by 8:\n\n128 bits / 8 = 16 bytes per block\n\nNow, we divide the message size (155 bytes) by the block size (16 bytes):\n\n155 bytes / 16 bytes = 9.6875\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a block, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\n10 blocks\n\nSo, there will be 10 blocks of plaintext needed to encrypt a 155-byte message using AES with a 128-bit block size."
