    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem that a math student can solve:\n\nA factory wants to produce two types of products, A and B, using two machines, X and Y. Each unit of product A requires 4 hours on machine X and 3 hours on machine Y. Each unit of product B requires 2 hours on machine X and 5 hours on machine Y. Machine X can operate for a maximum of 250 hours per week, while machine Y can operate for a maximum of 200 hours per week. The factory wants to maximize its profit from selling the products, given that the profit per unit of A is $10 and the profit per unit of B is $8. How many units of each product should the factory produce each week to achieve the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced each week. We need to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 8y, subject to the constraints:\n\n4x + 2y ≤ 250 (Machine X constraint)\n3x + 5y ≤ 200 (Machine Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraints)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraint inequalities:\n\n4x + 2y ≤ 250 => y ≤ (250 - 4x) / 2\n3x + 5y ≤ 200 => y ≤ (200 - 3x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities, along with the non-negativity constraints x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (200 - 3x) / 5: (0, 40)\n3. Intersection of x = (250 - 4x) / 2 and y = 0: (62.5, 0)\n4. Intersection of 4x + 2y = 250 and 3x + 5y = 200:\n\nSolving the system of equations:\n\n4x + 2y = 250\n3x + 5y = 200\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate y:\n\n20x + 10y = 1250\n6x + 10y = 400\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n14x = 850\nx = 850 / 14\nx ≈ 60.71\n\nPlugging x back into the first equation:\n\n4(60.71) + 2y = 250\ny ≈ 14.29\n\nSo, the intersection point is approximately (60.71, 14.29).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 8y at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 8(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 8(40) = 320\n3. P(62.5, 0) = 10(62.5) + 8(0) = 625\n4. P(60.71, 14.29) ≈ 10(60.71) + 8(14.29) ≈ 728.57\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the point (60.71, 14.29), with a profit of approximately $728.57. However, since the factory can only produce whole units of products, we need to round the values to the nearest integers. We can try (60, 14), (61, 14), and (60, 15) and calculate the profit for each:\n\nP(60, 14) = 10(60) + 8(14) = 720\nP(61, 14) = 10(61) + 8(14) = 730\nP(60, 15) = 10(60) + 8(15) = 720\n\nThe maximum profit of $730 is achieved when the factory produces 61 units of product A and 14 units of product B each week."
