    "message_1": "In a principal-agent relationship, the principal offers a contract with a fixed payment of $10,000 plus a bonus fee that depends on the agent's performance. The agent can choose between two effort levels, high effort and low effort. If the agent chooses high effort, the probability of achieving a successful outcome is 0.7, and the bonus fee is $6,000. If the agent chooses low effort, the probability of achieving a successful outcome is 0.4, and the bonus fee is $3,000. Assuming that the agent is risk-neutral, which effort level will the agent choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which effort level the agent will choose, we need to calculate the expected value of each effort level. The expected value is the probability of success multiplied by the bonus fee.\n\nFor high effort:\nExpected value = Probability of success * Bonus fee\nExpected value = 0.7 * $6,000\nExpected value = $4,200\n\nFor low effort:\nExpected value = Probability of success * Bonus fee\nExpected value = 0.4 * $3,000\nExpected value = $1,200\n\nSince the agent is risk-neutral, they will choose the effort level with the higher expected value. In this case, the agent will choose the high effort level, as the expected value of $4,200 is greater than the expected value of $1,200 for the low effort level."
