    "message_2": "A smooth projective curve of genus g has the following Hodge diamond:\n\n```\n  1\ng   g\n  1\n```\n\nFor a curve of genus 3, the Hodge diamond looks like this:\n\n```\n  1\n3   3\n  1\n```\n\nThis means that the dimensions of the spaces of harmonic forms of different degrees are as follows:\n\n- H^0,0 = 1 (constant functions)\n- H^1,0 = H^0,1 = 3 (holomorphic 1-forms and their conjugates)\n- H^2,0 = H^0,2 = 0 (there are no nontrivial holomorphic 2-forms on a curve)\n- H^1,1 = 1 (real 2-forms)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the spaces of harmonic forms for a smooth projective curve of genus 3 are 1, 3, 3, and 1."
