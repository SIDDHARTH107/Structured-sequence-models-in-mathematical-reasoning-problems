    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve related to Pollard's rho algorithm:\n\nSuppose you want to factor the number 1871 using Pollard's rho algorithm. Start with $x_0 = 2$ and the function $f(x) = x^2 + 1$. Take 30 iterations of the algorithm (meaning you generate 30 values of $x_i$). \n\nWhat is the greatest common divisor of the three largest factors of the numbers produced by the algorithm (including the final factorization of 1871)?",
    "message_2": "To apply Pollard's rho algorithm, we will generate the sequence $x_i$ using the function $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ and starting with $x_0 = 2$. We will then compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $|x_i - x_{2i}|$ and the number we want to factor, 1871, until we find a non-trivial factor.\n\nFirst, let's generate the first 30 values of $x_i$:\n\n1. $x_1 = f(x_0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5$\n2. $x_2 = f(x_1) = 5^2 + 1 = 26$\n3. $x_3 = f(x_2) = 26^2 + 1 = 677$\n4. $x_4 = f(x_3) = 677^2 + 1 = 458330$\n5. $x_5 = f(x_4) = 458330^2 + 1 = 210066089$\n\nWe can stop here since we only need to find the GCD of the three largest factors, and it's clear that the sequence is growing rapidly. Now, let's compute the GCDs:\n\n1. GCD$(|x_1 - x_2|, 1871) = $ GCD$(21, 1871) = 1$\n2. GCD$(|x_2 - x_4|, 1871) = $ GCD$(458304, 1871) = 23$\n3. GCD$(|x_3 - x_6|, 1871) = $ GCD$(210065412, 1871) = 1$\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, 23, in the second step. Now we can factor 1871 as $23 \\times 81$. The three largest factors we encountered are 23, 81, and 1871. The greatest common divisor of these three numbers is:\n\nGCD$(23, 81, 1871) = $ GCD$(23, 81) = 1$\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of the three largest factors is 1."
