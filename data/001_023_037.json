    "message_2": "To find all solutions to the equation sin(2x) - 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π), we first rewrite the equation as:\n\nsin(2x) = 1\n\nNow, we know that sin(θ) = 1 when θ = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer. So, we can write the equation as:\n\n2x = (2n + 1)π/2\n\nNow, we need to find all values of x in the interval [0, 2π) that satisfy this equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = (2n + 1)π/4\n\nNow, we need to find all integer values of n that result in x being in the interval [0, 2π). Let's start with n = 0:\n\nx = (2(0) + 1)π/4 = π/4\n\nThis value is in the interval, so it's one solution. Now, let's try n = 1:\n\nx = (2(1) + 1)π/4 = 3π/4\n\nThis value is also in the interval, so it's another solution. Let's try n = 2:\n\nx = (2(2) + 1)π/4 = 5π/4\n\nThis value is in the interval as well, so it's another solution. Finally, let's try n = 3:\n\nx = (2(3) + 1)π/4 = 7π/4\n\nThis value is also in the interval, so it's another solution. If we try n = 4, we get:\n\nx = (2(4) + 1)π/4 = 9π/4\n\nThis value is not in the interval [0, 2π), so we can stop here.\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation sin(2x) - 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π) are x = π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, and 7π/4."
