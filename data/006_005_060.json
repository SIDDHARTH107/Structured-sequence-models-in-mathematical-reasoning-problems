    "message_1": "A wooden barrel contains 20 red, 30 green, and 50 blue marbles. If a marble is picked at random from the barrel, what is the probability of selecting a green marble in the first two attempts?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of selecting a green marble in the first two attempts, we can use the complementary probability method. We will first find the probability of not selecting a green marble in both attempts and then subtract it from 1.\n\nTotal marbles in the barrel = 20 red + 30 green + 50 blue = 100 marbles\n\nProbability of not selecting a green marble in the first attempt = (20 red + 50 blue) / 100 = 70/100 = 7/10\n\nAfter the first attempt, there are 99 marbles left in the barrel.\n\nProbability of not selecting a green marble in the second attempt, given that a green marble was not selected in the first attempt = (19 red + 50 blue) / 99 = 69/99\n\nNow, we multiply the probabilities of not selecting a green marble in both attempts:\n\n(7/10) * (69/99) = 483/990\n\nFinally, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of selecting a green marble in the first two attempts:\n\n1 - (483/990) = 507/990\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a green marble in the first two attempts is 507/990."
