    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a point within the white frond of the Barnsley fern after three iterations, we need to consider all possible combinations of transformations that can occur in those three iterations. There are 4 transformations, so there are 4^3 = 64 possible combinations of transformations.\n\nHowever, the white frond of the Barnsley fern is mainly generated by Transformation 1 and Transformation 2. The other two transformations (3 and 4) contribute to the smaller fronds. So, we will focus on the combinations that include Transformation 1 and Transformation 2.\n\nLet's consider the probabilities of each transformation occurring in the three iterations:\n\n1. T1-T1-T1: (0.01)^3 = 0.000001\n2. T1-T1-T2: (0.01)^2 * 0.85 = 0.000085\n3. T1-T2-T1: 0.01 * (0.85)^2 = 0.007225\n4. T1-T2-T2: 0.01 * 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.007225\n5. T2-T1-T1: (0.85)^2 * 0.01 = 0.007225\n6. T2-T1-T2: 0.85 * 0.01 * 0.85 = 0.007225\n7. T2-T2-T1: 0.85 * (0.85)^2 = 0.614125\n8. T2-T2-T2: (0.85)^3 = 0.614125\n\nNow, we sum up these probabilities:\n\n0.000001 + 0.000085 + 0.007225 + 0.007225 + 0.007225 + 0.007225 + 0.614125 + 0.614125 = 1.257236\n\nSince the total probability should be 1, we need to normalize these probabilities:\n\nNormalized probabilities:\n\n1. T1-T1-T1: 0.000001 / 1.257236 ≈ 0.0000008\n2. T1-T1-T2: 0.000085 / 1.257236 ≈ 0.0000676\n3. T1-T2-T1: 0.007225 / 1.257236 ≈ 0.005748\n4. T1-T2-T2: 0.007225 / 1.257236 ≈ 0.005748\n5. T2-T1-T1: 0.007225 / 1.257236 ≈ 0.005748\n6. T2-T1-T2: 0.007225 / 1.257236 ≈ 0.005748\n7. T2-T2-T1: 0.614125 / 1.257236 ≈ 0.488376\n8. T2-T2-T2: 0.614125 / 1.257236 ≈ 0.488376\n\nThe probability of selecting a point within the white frond of the Barnsley fern after three iterations is the sum of the probabilities of the combinations that include Transformation 1 and Transformation 2:\n\n0.0000008 + 0.0000676 + 0.005748 + 0.005748 + 0.005748 + 0.005748 + 0.488376 + 0.488376 ≈ 0.9998136\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.9998 or 99.98%."
