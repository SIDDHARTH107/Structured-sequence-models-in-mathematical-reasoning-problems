    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree. If it does, skip the edge.\n4. Continue until the minimum spanning tree has (number of vertices - 1) edges.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. Sorting the edges by weight:\n   - CD: 1\n   - BC: 2\n   - EF: 2\n   - AC: 3\n   - DE: 3\n   - AB: 4\n   - CF: 4\n   - DF: 4\n   - BD: 5\n   - CE: 6\n\n2. Start with an empty graph.\n\n3. Add edges one by one:\n   - Add CD (weight 1): no cycle formed.\n   - Add BC (weight 2): no cycle formed.\n   - Add EF (weight 2): no cycle formed.\n   - Add AC (weight 3): cycle formed (ACB), skip this edge.\n   - Add DE (weight 3): no cycle formed.\n   - Add AB (weight 4): cycle formed (ABCD), skip this edge.\n   - Add CF (weight 4): no cycle formed.\n\n4. We now have 5 edges in the minimum spanning tree, which is equal to (number of vertices - 1). So, we can stop here.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree consists of the following edges:\n- CD: 1\n- BC: 2\n- EF: 2\n- DE: 3\n- CF: 4\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 12."
