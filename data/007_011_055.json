    "message_2": "A quadratic residue modulo n is an integer that is congruent to a perfect square modulo n. To find the quadratic residues modulo 5, we need to consider the squares of the integers from 0 to 4 (since we are working modulo 5) and then reduce them modulo 5.\n\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n3² ≡ 9 ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n4² ≡ 16 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues modulo 5 are {0, 1, 4}."
