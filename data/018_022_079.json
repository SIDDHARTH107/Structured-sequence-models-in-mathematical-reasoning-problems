    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference between A and B, which is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetric difference between B and A. However, the symmetric difference is commutative, meaning that A △ B = B △ A. So, we already have the result:\n\nB △ A = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of these two sets, which is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A △ B and b is in B △ A.\n\n(A △ B) x (B △ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences is:\n\n{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5)}"
