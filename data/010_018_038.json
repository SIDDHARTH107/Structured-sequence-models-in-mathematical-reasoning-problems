    "message_1": "Consider a Morse-Smale complex with 6 critical points, where 3 are local maxima and 3 are local minima. If the index of one of the local maxima is 4 and the index of one of the local minima is 1, what is the sum of the indices of the remaining critical points?",
    "message_2": "In a Morse-Smale complex, the index of a critical point corresponds to the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point. Local maxima have the highest index, while local minima have the lowest index.\n\nSince there are 3 local maxima and 3 local minima, and we know the index of one local maximum is 4 and the index of one local minimum is 1, we can deduce the indices of the remaining critical points.\n\nFor the remaining 2 local maxima, they must have indices lower than 4. The highest possible index for a local maximum is 3, so the other two local maxima must have indices of 3 and 2.\n\nFor the remaining 2 local minima, they must have indices higher than 1. The lowest possible index for a local minimum is 0, so the other two local minima must have indices of 0 and 1.\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the indices of the remaining critical points:\n\n3 (local maximum) + 2 (local maximum) + 0 (local minimum) + 1 (local minimum) = 6."
