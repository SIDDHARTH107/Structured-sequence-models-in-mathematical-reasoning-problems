    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and the tree satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices in the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nWe can create a tree decomposition of the given graph as follows:\n\n1. Bag 1: {A, B, C}\n2. Bag 2: {B, C, D}\n3. Bag 3: {B, C, E}\n4. Bag 4: {C, E, F}\n5. Bag 5: {C, D, F}\n\nThe tree structure can be represented as:\n\n       1\n      / \\\n     2   3\n    /     \\\n   5       4\n\nThe treewidth of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case, the largest bag has 3 vertices, so the treewidth of the given graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
