    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the formula (p ∧ q) → (◇p ∧ ◇q) at time t, let's break down the formula and evaluate each part based on the given information.\n\n1. p ∧ q: This part of the formula is true if both p and q are true. At time t, p is true at t+1 and q is false at t. Therefore, p ∧ q is false at time t.\n\n2. ◇p: This part of the formula is true if p is eventually true. Since p is true at time t+1, ◇p is true.\n\n3. ◇q: This part of the formula is true if q is eventually true. Since q is true at time t-1, ◇q is true.\n\nNow, let's combine the results:\n\n(◇p ∧ ◇q): This part of the formula is true if both ◇p and ◇q are true. Since both ◇p and ◇q are true, (◇p ∧ ◇q) is true.\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the entire formula:\n\n(p ∧ q) → (◇p ∧ ◇q): This formula is true if either (p ∧ q) is false or (◇p ∧ ◇q) is true. Since (p ∧ q) is false and (◇p ∧ ◇q) is true, the entire formula is true at time t."
