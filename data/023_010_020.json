    "message_2": "To compute the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the given 4x4 image matrix, we can use the following equation:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * exp(-2πi(ux/M + vy/N))), x=0 to M-1), y=0 to N-1\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the Fourier transform at frequency (u, v), f(x, y) is the intensity value at position (x, y) in the image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (in this case, M = N = 4), and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe given image matrix is:\n```\n5 5 5 5 \n5 0 0 5 \n5 0 0 5 \n5 5 5 5\n```\n\nNow, we will compute the Fourier transform for each frequency component (u, v) in the range 0 to 3.\n\nF(u, v) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * exp(-2πi(ux/4 + vy/4))), x=0 to 3), y=0 to 3\n\nAfter calculating the Fourier transform for each frequency component, we get the following matrix:\n\n```\nF(0, 0) = 40 + 0i\nF(0, 1) = 0 + 0i\nF(0, 2) = 0 + 0i\nF(0, 3) = 0 + 0i\nF(1, 0) = 0 + 0i\nF(1, 1) = 20 - 20i\nF(1, 2) = 0 + 0i\nF(1, 3) = 20 + 20i\nF(2, 0) = 0 + 0i\nF(2, 1) = 0 + 0i\nF(2, 2) = 0 + 0i\nF(2, 3) = 0 + 0i\nF(3, 0) = 0 + 0i\nF(3, 1) = 20 + 20i\nF(3, 2) = 0 + 0i\nF(3, 3) = 20 - 20i\n```\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given image matrix is:\n\n```\n40 + 0i   0 + 0i   0 + 0i   0 + 0i\n 0 + 0i  20 - 20i  0 + 0i  20 + 20i\n 0 + 0i   0 + 0i   0 + 0i   0 + 0i\n 0 + 0i  20 + 20i  0 + 0i  20 - 20i\n```"
