    "message_1": "In a set of 10 cards, each card is colored either red or blue. How many ways can the cards be colored if exactly 4 cards are red and 6 cards are blue?",
    "message_2": "This is a combinatorics problem. We need to find the number of ways to choose 4 red cards out of 10 cards. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of cards (10 in this case) and k is the number of red cards (4 in this case).\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo there are 210 ways to color the cards with exactly 4 red cards and 6 blue cards."
