    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using block matrices, we first write the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1  2 |\n    | 0  3 -2 |\n    | 2  1  1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | -5 |\n    |  8 |\n\nNow, we partition the matrix A into block matrices:\n\nA = | A1 A2 |\n    | A3 A4 |\n\nwhere A1 is a 1x1 matrix, A2 is a 1x2 matrix, A3 is a 2x1 matrix, and A4 is a 2x2 matrix.\n\nA1 = | 1 |\nA2 = | 1  2 |\nA3 = | 2 |\nA4 = | 3 -2 |\n    | 1  1 |\n\nNext, we partition the matrix X into block matrices:\n\nX = | X1 |\n    | X2 |\n\nwhere X1 is a 1x1 matrix and X2 is a 2x1 matrix.\n\nX1 = | x |\nX2 = | y |\n    | z |\n\nNow, we can write the matrix equation AX = B in terms of the block matrices:\n\n| A1 A2 | | X1 |   | B1 |\n| A3 A4 | | X2 | = | B2 |\n\nwhere B1 is a 1x1 matrix and B2 is a 2x1 matrix.\n\nB1 = | 10 |\nB2 = | -5 |\n    |  8 |\n\nNow, we can solve the block matrix equation using the Schur complement method. First, we find the Schur complement S of A1 in A:\n\nS = A4 - A3 * A1^(-1) * A2\n\nS = | 3 -2 | - | 2 | * (1)^(-1) * | 1  2 |\n    | 1  1 |\n\nS = | 3 -2 | - | 2  4 |\n    | 1  1 |\n\nS = | 1 -6 |\n    |-1  5 |\n\nNow, we solve the equation S * X2 = B2 - A3 * A1^(-1) * B1:\n\n| 1 -6 | | y |   | -5 - 2 * (1)^(-1) * 10 |\n|-1  5 | | z | = |  8 - 2 * (1)^(-1) * 10 |\n\n| 1 -6 | | y |   | -25 |\n|-1  5 | | z | = | -12 |\n\nSolving the above system of linear equations, we get:\n\ny = 3\nz = 1\n\nNow, we can find X1 using the equation A1 * X1 = B1 - A2 * X2:\n\n1 * x = 10 - | 1  2 | * | 3 |\n                      | 1 |\n\nx = 10 - (1 * 3 + 2 * 1)\nx = 10 - 5\nx = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 5\ny = 3\nz = 1"
