    "message_2": "a) To show that the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$ acts on $C$ as automorphisms, we need to show that for any element $(a, b) \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$, the transformation $T_{(a, b)}: (x, y) \\mapsto (\\omega^a x, \\omega^b y)$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, preserves the equation of the curve $C$. \n\nRecall that $\\omega^3 = 1$ and $\\omega^6 = 1$. Now, let's apply the transformation $T_{(a, b)}$ to the equation of the curve $C$:\n\n$$T_{(a, b)}: (\\omega^a x)^3 + (\\omega^b y)^3 - 3(\\omega^a x)(\\omega^b y) = 0$$\n\nUsing the properties of $\\omega$, we can simplify the equation:\n\n$$\\omega^{3a} x^3 + \\omega^{3b} y^3 - 3\\omega^{a+b} xy = 0$$\n\nSince $\\omega^3 = 1$, we have:\n\n$$x^3 + y^3 - 3\\omega^{a+b} xy = 0$$\n\nNow, we need to show that this equation is equivalent to the original equation of the curve $C$. Since $(a, b) \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$, we have $a+b \\equiv 0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3}$. \n\nIf $a+b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $\\omega^{a+b} = 1$, and the equation is the same as the original equation of the curve $C$. \n\nIf $a+b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $\\omega^{a+b} = \\omega$, and the equation becomes:\n\n$$x^3 + y^3 - 3\\omega xy = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy\\omega = 0$$\n\nMultiplying the original equation by $\\omega$, we get the same equation, so the transformation preserves the equation of the curve $C$.\n\nIf $a+b \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $\\omega^{a+b} = \\omega^2$, and the equation becomes:\n\n$$x^3 + y^3 - 3\\omega^2 xy = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy\\omega^2 = 0$$\n\nMultiplying the original equation by $\\omega^2$, we get the same equation, so the transformation preserves the equation of the curve $C$.\n\nThus, the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$ acts on $C$ as automorphisms.\n\nb) To determine the algebra of invariants of this group action, we need to find the functions on $C$ that are invariant under the action of $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$. Let's consider the following functions:\n\n$$I_1 = x^3 + y^3$$\n$$I_2 = x^3y^3$$\n\nApplying the transformation $T_{(a, b)}$ to these functions, we get:\n\n$$T_{(a, b)}(I_1) = (\\omega^a x)^3 + (\\omega^b y)^3 = \\omega^{3a} x^3 + \\omega^{3b} y^3 = x^3 + y^3 = I_1$$\n$$T_{(a, b)}(I_2) = (\\omega^a x)^3(\\omega^b y)^3 = \\omega^{3a+3b} x^3y^3 = x^3y^3 = I_2$$\n\nSince both $I_1$ and $I_2$ are invariant under the action of $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$, the algebra of invariants is generated by $I_1$ and $I_2$.\n\nc) To find an equation in the invariants that defines the quotient $C /(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$ as an algebraic curve in the projective plane, we need to eliminate $x$ and $y$ from the equation of the curve $C$ using the invariants $I_1$ and $I_2$. \n\nFrom the equation of the curve $C$, we have:\n\n$$x^3 + y^3 = 3xy$$\n\nNow, we can express $x^3$ and $y^3$ in terms of the invariants:\n\n$$x^3 = I_1 - y^3$$\n$$y^3 = I_1 - x^3$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $I_2$, we get:\n\n$$I_2 = (I_1 - y^3)(I_1 - x^3)$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain:\n\n$$I_2 = I_1^2 - I_1(x^3 + y^3) + x^3y^3$$\n\nUsing the equation of the curve $C$ to eliminate $x^3 + y^3$, we get:\n\n$$I_2 = I_1^2 - 3I_1xy + x^3y^3$$\n\nThis equation defines the quotient $C /(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$ as an algebraic curve in the projective plane."
