    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ inside the closed disk $D$, we first note that $f(z) = (z-1)^2$ is a holomorphic function, and thus, by the Maximum Modulus Principle, its maximum value must be attained on the boundary of $D$. The boundary of $D$ is a circle centered at $2$ with radius $3$, given by the equation $|z-2|=3$.\n\nLet $z = x + yi$ be a complex number on the boundary of $D$. Then, we have $|x + yi - 2| = 3$, which simplifies to $|(x-2) + yi| = 3$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 9$.\n\nNow, we compute $|f(z)|$ for $z$ on the boundary of $D$:\n\n$|f(z)| = |(z-1)^2| = |(x-1 + yi)^2| = |(x-1)^2 - y^2 + 2(x-1)yi| = \\sqrt{((x-1)^2 - y^2)^2 + (2(x-1)y)^2}$.\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of this expression, we can instead find the maximum and minimum values of its square:\n\n$((x-1)^2 - y^2)^2 + (2(x-1)y)^2 = (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2)^2 + 4(x^2 - 2x + 1)y^2$.\n\nNow, we use the equation of the boundary of $D$, $(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 9$, to eliminate one variable. We have $y^2 = 9 - (x-2)^2 = 9 - (x^2 - 4x + 4) = 5 + 4x - x^2$. Substituting this into the expression for $|f(z)|^2$, we get:\n\n$((x^2 - 2x + 1 + 5 + 4x - x^2)^2 + 4(x^2 - 2x + 1)(5 + 4x - x^2)$.\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$(6x)^2 + 4(x^2 - 2x + 1)(5 + 4x - x^2) = 36x^2 + 20x^2 - 4x^3 - 8x^3 + 16x^2 - 4x^4 = 4x^2(9 - x^2)(1 - x)$.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum values of this expression for $x$ in the range $[-1, 5]$ (since the disk $D$ has a radius of $3$ and is centered at $2$). We can analyze the critical points of the expression:\n\n1. $x = 0$: In this case, $|f(z)|^2 = 0$, so $|f(z)| = 0$.\n2. $x = 1$: In this case, $|f(z)|^2 = 4(9 - 1)(1 - 1) = 0$, so $|f(z)| = 0$.\n3. $x = 3$: In this case, $|f(z)|^2 = 4(9 - 9)(1 - 3) = 0$, so $|f(z)| = 0$.\n\nSince the function $4x^2(9 - x^2)(1 - x)$ is continuous and differentiable on the interval $[-1, 5]$, and we have analyzed all critical points, we can conclude that the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ inside $D$ is $0$.\n\nTo find the maximum value of $|f(z)|$, we check the endpoints of the interval:\n\n1. $x = -1$: In this case, $|f(z)|^2 = 4(1)(9 - 1)(1 - (-1)) = 64$, so $|f(z)| = 8$.\n2. $x = 5$: In this case, $|f(z)|^2 = 4(25)(9 - 25)(1 - 5) = 64$, so $|f(z)| = 8$.\n\nThus, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ inside $D$ is $8$.\n\nIn summary, the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ inside $D$ is $0$, and the maximum value is $8$."
