    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's represent the distance between the ship and the lighthouse as d (the hypotenuse), the eastward distance as a, and the northward distance as b. In this case, a = 3 miles and b = 2 miles.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSubstitute the values of a and b:\n\nd^2 = (3)^2 + (2)^2\nd^2 = 9 + 4\nd^2 = 13\n\nNow, find the square root of both sides to get the value of d:\n\nd = √13\nd ≈ 3.6 miles (rounded to the nearest tenth)\n\nSo, the distance between the ship and the lighthouse is approximately 3.6 miles."
