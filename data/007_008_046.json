    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p - a is divisible by p. In other words, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nIn this case, p = 7. So, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer a, a^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7).\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 5^6 is divided by 7. Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that 5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7). Therefore, the remainder when 5^6 is divided by 7 is 1."
