    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and h be the height of the box. The surface area of the box (without the top) is given by:\n\nA = x^2 + 4xh\n\nSince the company has 1000 square meters of cardboard, we have:\n\n1000 = x^2 + 4xh\n\nWe want to maximize the volume of the box, which is given by:\n\nV = x^2h\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of x from the surface area equation:\n\nh = (1000 - x^2) / 4x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the volume equation:\n\nV(x) = x^2((1000 - x^2) / 4x) = (1000x - x^3) / 4\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we can take the derivative of V(x) with respect to x and set it to 0:\n\ndV/dx = (1000 - 3x^2) / 4\n\nSetting dV/dx to 0, we get:\n\n0 = 1000 - 3x^2\n3x^2 = 1000\nx^2 = 1000 / 3\nx = √(1000 / 3)\n\nNow, we can find the height h using the expression we derived earlier:\n\nh = (1000 - x^2) / 4x\nh = (1000 - (1000 / 3)) / (4 * √(1000 / 3))\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum volume V:\n\nV = x^2h\nV = (1000 / 3) * ((2000 / 3) / (4 * √(1000 / 3)))\nV ≈ 2500√(3) / 3 m^3\n\nSo, the maximum volume of the box that the company can produce is approximately 2500√(3) / 3 cubic meters."
