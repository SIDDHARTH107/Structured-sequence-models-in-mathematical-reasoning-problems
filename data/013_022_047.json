    "message_1": "A dictator game is played with two players. The dictator decides how to split a sum of money between them, and the other player has no say. Suppose the dictator is given $50 to split between them. If the dictator's utility is linear in the amount kept, and the dictator values their own money more highly than the other player's, what is the amount they will keep for themselves?",
    "message_2": "Since the dictator's utility is linear in the amount kept and they value their own money more highly than the other player's, the dictator will keep the entire $50 for themselves."
