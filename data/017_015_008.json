    "message_2": "To prove that the group G of order 24 with seven elements of order 3 is isomorphic to the alternating group A5, we will first analyze the structure of G and then show that it has the same structure as A5.\n\n1. G has order 24, and by Sylow's Theorems, it has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3. Since there are seven elements of order 3 in G, P must be unique.\n\n2. Let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since the order of G is 24, the order of Q is 8. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is either 1 or 3. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it is normal in G. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, then by counting the elements of order 2, we find that there are 1 + 2 * 3 = 7 elements of order 2 in G.\n\n3. Now consider the action of G on the set of left cosets of P in G. This action is transitive, and the stabilizer of the coset P is P itself. Therefore, the action of G on the cosets of P gives a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S4. Since P is normal in G, the image of this homomorphism is a subgroup of the alternating group A4.\n\n4. Since G has seven elements of order 3, the image of G under this homomorphism must contain a 3-cycle. Therefore, the image of G is not a subgroup of order 2 in A4, so it must be the entire group A4.\n\n5. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of P with the stabilizer of P, which is just P itself. Therefore, the homomorphism is an isomorphism between G/P and A4.\n\n6. Now consider the action of G on the set of left cosets of Q in G. This action is also transitive, and the stabilizer of the coset Q is Q itself. Therefore, the action of G on the cosets of Q gives a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S3.\n\n7. Since G has seven elements of order 2, the image of G under this homomorphism must contain a 2-cycle. Therefore, the image of G is not a subgroup of order 3 in S3, so it must be the entire group S3.\n\n8. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of Q with the stabilizer of Q, which is just Q itself. Therefore, the homomorphism is an isomorphism between G/Q and S3.\n\n9. Now we have the following short exact sequence of groups:\n\n1 -> Q -> G -> S3 -> 1\n\nSince G/Q is isomorphic to S3 and G/P is isomorphic to A4, we have:\n\n1 -> Q -> G -> G/P -> 1\n\n10. By the Schreier's Theorem, there exists a group H such that G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as P â‹Š Q.\n\n11. The group A5 has order 60, and it is well-known that A5 is simple, meaning it has no nontrivial normal subgroups. Since G has order 24, it is a subgroup of A5.\n\n12. Now we will show that G is isomorphic to A5. Since A5 is simple, any homomorphism from G to A5 must be injective. Therefore, G is isomorphic to a subgroup of A5. Since G has order 24 and A5 has order 60, the index of G in A5 is 60/24 = 5/2, which is not an integer. Therefore, G cannot be a proper subgroup of A5, so G must be isomorphic to A5 itself.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the group G of order 24 with seven elements of order 3 is isomorphic to the alternating group A5."
