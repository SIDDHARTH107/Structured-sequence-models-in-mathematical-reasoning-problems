    "message_1": "A math student has taken a sample of 50 students in their school, and wants to estimate the average height of all students with 95% confidence. The sample mean height is 65 inches with a sample standard deviation of 3 inches. What is the 95% confidence interval for the average height of all students in the school?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the average height of all students in the school, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Sample Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nThe critical value for a 95% confidence interval can be found using a standard normal (Z) table, which is approximately 1.96.\n\nGiven:\nSample Mean = 65 inches\nSample Standard Deviation = 3 inches\nSample Size = 50 students\nCritical Value = 1.96\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 65 ± (1.96 * (3 / √50))\n\nConfidence Interval = 65 ± (1.96 * (3 / 7.071))\n\nConfidence Interval = 65 ± (1.96 * 0.424)\n\nConfidence Interval = 65 ± 0.831\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the average height of all students in the school is approximately (64.169, 65.831) inches."
