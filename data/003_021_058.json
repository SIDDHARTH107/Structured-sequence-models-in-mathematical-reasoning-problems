    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of two vectors u and v is given by:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu · v = (1 * 4) + (2 * 5) = 4 + 10 = 14\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n\n|u| = √(1² + 2²) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n|v| = √(4² + 5²) = √(16 + 25) = √41\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n14 = (√5)(√41) cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by (√5)(√41):\n\ncos(θ) = 14 / (√5 * √41)\n\nNow, find the inverse cosine (arccos) to get the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(14 / (√5 * √41))\n\nθ ≈ 0.3217 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, multiply by (180/π):\n\nθ ≈ 0.3217 * (180/π) ≈ 18.43 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 18 degrees."
