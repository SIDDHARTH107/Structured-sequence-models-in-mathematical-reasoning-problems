The maximum capacity of each route is given in the table below. What is the maximum amount of product that the factory can transport from the source to the destination?\n\n| Route | Maximum Capacity |\n|-------|-----------------|\n| A-B   | 10              |\n| A-C   | 15              |\n| B-C   | 20              |\n| C-D   | 25              |\n| B-D   | 15              |",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of product that can be transported from the source to the destination, we need to identify the bottleneck in the transportation network. The bottleneck is the route with the lowest capacity that limits the overall flow of the product.\n\nLet's analyze the routes:\n\n1. A-B-D: The capacities are 10 (A-B) and 15 (B-D). The bottleneck is A-B with a capacity of 10.\n2. A-C-D: The capacities are 15 (A-C) and 25 (C-D). The bottleneck is A-C with a capacity of 15.\n\nComparing the two routes, we can see that the second route (A-C-D) has a higher bottleneck capacity of 15. Therefore, the maximum amount of product that the factory can transport from the source to the destination is 15 units."
