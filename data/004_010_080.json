    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 4x^2 + 6x + 7 with respect to x, we need to find a function F(x) such that the derivative of F(x) is equal to f(x). We can do this by integrating f(x) with respect to x.\n\nThe antiderivative of f(x) = 4x^2 + 6x + 7 is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(4x^2 + 6x + 7) dx\n\nWe can integrate each term separately:\n\nF(x) = ∫(4x^2) dx + ∫(6x) dx + ∫(7) dx\n\nNow, we apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), and the antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x:\n\nF(x) = (4x^(2+1))/(2+1) + (6x^(1+1))/(1+1) + 7x + C\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nF(x) = (4x^3)/3 + (6x^2)/2 + 7x + C\n\nF(x) = (4/3)x^3 + 3x^2 + 7x + C\n\nHere, F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x) and C is the constant of integration."
