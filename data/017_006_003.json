    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has the order p * q, where p = 5 and q = 7 are prime numbers. According to the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, a group of order p * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q.\n\nTo determine whether the group is cyclic, we can use the fact that a group of order n is cyclic if and only if there exists an element of order n in the group. In this case, we need to find an element of order 35.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists an element x in the group such that its order modulo 5 is 5 and its order modulo 7 is 7. The order of x in the group is the least common multiple of its orders modulo 5 and 7, which is lcm(5, 7) = 35. Therefore, there exists an element of order 35 in the group, and the group is cyclic.\n\nSince the group is cyclic, it is not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
