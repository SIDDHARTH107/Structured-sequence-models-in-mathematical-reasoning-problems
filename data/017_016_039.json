    "message_2": "First, let's recall some facts about p-groups and their centers. If G is a group of order p^n, where p is a prime number, then G is called a p-group. The center of a group G, denoted Z(G), is the set of all elements that commute with every element in G. It is a well-known fact that the center of a non-trivial p-group is always non-trivial.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 27 = 3^3. Since 3 is a prime number, G is a 3-group. By the fact mentioned above, Z(G) is non-trivial. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: Z(G) is trivial.\nThis case is not possible, as we have already established that the center of a non-trivial p-group is non-trivial.\n\nCase 2: Z(G) is non-trivial.\nSince Z(G) is a subgroup of G, its order must divide the order of G. Thus, the order of Z(G) can be 1, 3, 9, or 27. If the order of Z(G) is 27, then G is abelian and isomorphic to the cyclic group C27. If the order of Z(G) is 1, we have already shown that this case is not possible.\n\nNow, let's assume that the order of Z(G) is 3. By the Class Equation, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nwhere the sum is taken over one representative x from each non-central conjugacy class C(x) of G. Since |G| = 27 and |Z(G)| = 3, we have:\n\n27 = 3 + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nThe order of each conjugacy class [G:C(x)] must divide the order of G, so it can be 1, 3, 9, or 27. However, if [G:C(x)] = 1, then x is in the center, which is a contradiction. If [G:C(x)] = 27, then the conjugacy class has only one element, which means x is in the center, again a contradiction. Therefore, [G:C(x)] must be 3 or 9.\n\nIf all conjugacy classes have order 3, then the equation becomes:\n\n27 = 3 + 3k\n\nwhich has no integer solution for k. Therefore, there must be at least one conjugacy class of order 9. The equation becomes:\n\n27 = 3 + 9k\n\nwhich has a unique integer solution k = 2. Thus, there are two conjugacy classes of order 9, and G has the following structure:\n\nG = Z(G) ∪ C(x1) ∪ C(x2)\n\nwhere x1 and x2 are representatives of the two non-central conjugacy classes of order 9. This structure uniquely determines the non-abelian group of order 27, up to isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, if the center of G is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, depending on the order of the center."
