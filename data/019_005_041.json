You are allowed to ask a question to the guard stationed in front of the doors, who knows which door leads to the treasure. You can only ask a question to which the guard can respond with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\nWhat is the minimum number of questions needed to determine which door leads to the treasure?",
    "message_2": "The minimum number of questions needed to determine which door leads to the treasure is 1. You can ask the guard, \"If I were to ask you if the left door leads to the treasure, would you say 'yes'?\" If the guard says \"yes,\" then the left door leads to the treasure; if the guard says \"no,\" then the right door leads to the treasure."
