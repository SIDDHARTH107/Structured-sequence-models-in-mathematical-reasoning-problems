    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of this graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we can use the graph coloring algorithm. \n\nWe can start by assigning colors to the vertices one by one, making sure that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. \n\n1. Color A with color 1.\n2. Color B with color 2 (since it's adjacent to A).\n3. Color C with color 2 (since it's adjacent to A and D).\n4. Color D with color 3 (since it's adjacent to A, B, and C).\n5. Color E with color 1 (since it's adjacent to B and D).\n6. Color F with color 3 (since it's adjacent to B and E).\n7. Color G with color 1 (since it's adjacent to C and D).\n8. Color H with color 2 (since it's adjacent to D, E, and G).\n\nThe coloring would look like this:\n\n```\n     1---2\n    /|   |\\\n   / |   | \\\n  2--3---1--3\n   \\ |   | /\n    \\|   |/\n     1---2\n```\n\nWe have used 3 colors in this coloring, and it's not possible to color the graph with fewer colors without violating the condition that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of this graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 3."
