A sample of 50 boxes is taken, and their average weight is found to be 895 grams, with a standard deviation of 20 grams. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the boxes of cereal.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the boxes of cereal, we will use the following formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (895 grams)\nt = t-score (based on the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom, which is n-1)\ns = sample standard deviation (20 grams)\nn = sample size (50 boxes)\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom (n-1 = 50-1 = 49). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the t-score is approximately 2.0096.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 895 ± (2.0096 * (20 / √50))\n\nCI = 895 ± (2.0096 * (20 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 895 ± (2.0096 * 2.83)\n\nCI = 895 ± 5.69\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the boxes of cereal is approximately (889.31, 900.69) grams. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true mean weight of the cereal boxes is between 889.31 grams and 900.69 grams."
