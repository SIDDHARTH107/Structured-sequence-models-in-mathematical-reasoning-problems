    "message_2": "To find the probability that a person owns either a cat or a dog, but not both, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nwhere A represents owning a cat, B represents owning a dog, and P(A and B) represents owning both a cat and a dog.\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\nP(A or B) = 0.40 + 0.30 - 0.10\nP(A or B) = 0.60\n\nSo, the probability that a person owns either a cat or a dog, but not both, is 60%."
