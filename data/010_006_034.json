    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^2)$, we can use the fact that $S^2$ is simply connected. This means that any loop on the sphere can be continuously deformed to a point without leaving the sphere. Therefore, the fundamental group is trivial, and we have:\n\n$$\\pi_1(S^2) = \\{e\\}$$\n\nwhere $e$ is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's compute the second homotopy group $\\pi_2(S^2)$. The second homotopy group is defined as the set of homotopy classes of maps from the 2-sphere $S^2$ to itself. We can use the fact that $S^2$ is a compact, connected, and simply connected space. In this case, the Hurewicz theorem states that the second homotopy group is isomorphic to the second homology group:\n\n$$\\pi_2(S^2) \\cong H_2(S^2)$$\n\nThe second homology group of $S^2$ is given by:\n\n$$H_2(S^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$$\n\nThis is because $S^2$ has one non-trivial 2-cycle, which is the entire sphere itself, and the coefficients are integers. Therefore, the second homotopy group of $S^2$ is:\n\n$$\\pi_2(S^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$$"
