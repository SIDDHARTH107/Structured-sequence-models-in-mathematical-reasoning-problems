    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the system, we first need to find the impulse response h(t) of the system. The impulse response is the output of the system when the input is an impulse function, which is represented by the Dirac delta function, δ(t).\n\nSince the system is linear and time-invariant (LTI), we can use the convolution theorem to find the impulse response. The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is equal to the product of their individual Fourier transforms. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nF{h(t) * x(t)} = F{h(t)} * F{x(t)}\n\nwhere F denotes the Fourier transform, * denotes convolution, and h(t) is the impulse response of the system.\n\nWe are given the input signal x(t) = 2t^2 and the output signal y(t) = (8t^3 + 12t^2 + 6t)u(t). We can find the Fourier transform of both x(t) and y(t) and then use the convolution theorem to find the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t).\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of x(t) = 2t^2:\n\nF{x(t)} = ∫(2t^2 * e^(-jωt)) dt, from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince x(t) = 2t^2 is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF{x(t)} = 2 * ∫(t^2 * cos(ωt)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nThis integral is difficult to solve directly, so we can use integration by parts twice to find the solution. Let u = t^2 and dv = cos(ωt) dt. Then, du = 2t dt and v = (1/ω)sin(ωt). Applying integration by parts twice, we get:\n\nF{x(t)} = 2 * [(t^2 * (1/ω)sin(ωt) - ∫(2t * (1/ω)sin(ωt)) dt], from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, let u = t and dv = (1/ω)sin(ωt) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -(1/ω^2)cos(ωt). Applying integration by parts again, we get:\n\nF{x(t)} = 2 * [(t^2 * (1/ω)sin(ωt) + (t * (1/ω^2)cos(ωt) - ∫(-(1/ω^2)cos(ωt)) dt)], from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining term:\n\nF{x(t)} = 2 * [(t^2 * (1/ω)sin(ωt) + (t * (1/ω^2)cos(ωt) + (1/ω^3)sin(ωt))], from 0 to ∞\n\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\n\nF{x(t)} = 2 * (0 - 0 + 0 + 0 - 0 + (1/ω^3)sin(ωt)) = (4/ω^3)sin(ωt)\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of y(t) = (8t^3 + 12t^2 + 6t)u(t):\n\nF{y(t)} = ∫((8t^3 + 12t^2 + 6t) * e^(-jωt)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nThis integral is also difficult to solve directly, so we can use integration by parts multiple times to find the solution. However, since the problem asks for the Fourier transform of the system, we can use the convolution theorem to find the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t) without finding F{y(t)} directly:\n\nF{h(t)} = F{y(t)} / F{x(t)} = F{y(t)} / ((4/ω^3)sin(ωt))\n\nNow, we have the Fourier transform of the system, which is the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t):\n\nF{h(t)} = F{y(t)} / ((4/ω^3)sin(ωt))"
