    "message_2": "To show that f has a fixed point, we will use the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem. First, we need to show that X is a compact and convex subset of a Euclidean space. Since X is a topological space, we can assume that it is a compact and convex subset of a Euclidean space without loss of generality.\n\nNow, let's consider the homotopy H: X × [0, 1] → X between f o f and f, i.e., H(x, 0) = f(f(x)) and H(x, 1) = f(x) for all x in X. Define a new map g: X → X by g(x) = H(x, 1/2). Note that g o g = H(H(x, 1/2), 1/2) = H(x, 0) = f(f(x)) and g = H(x, 1/2).\n\nNow, consider the map F: X → X × X defined by F(x) = (g(x), f(x)). We will show that F is continuous. Since g and f are continuous maps, their product map F is also continuous by the product topology.\n\nNow, let's apply the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem to the map F. Since X is a compact and convex subset of a Euclidean space, there exists a point x₀ in X such that F(x₀) = x₀. This means that (g(x₀), f(x₀)) = (x₀, x₀).\n\nFrom this, we have g(x₀) = x₀ and f(x₀) = x₀. Since g o g = f o f, we have g(g(x₀)) = f(f(x₀)). By substituting g(x₀) = x₀ and f(x₀) = x₀, we get x₀ = f(x₀). Thus, f has a fixed point x₀ in X."
