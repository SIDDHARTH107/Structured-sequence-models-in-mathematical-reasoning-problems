    "message_1": "A steel rod is 10 cm long and has a temperature of 20°C at both ends. The ends are then brought into contact with a 0°C surface. Using the Fourier transform, determine the temperature distribution along the rod at a time of 5 seconds if the heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = k ∂2u/∂x2\n\nwhere k = 25 units and u(x,0) = 20°C for 0≤ x ≤ 10.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the separation of variables method and Fourier series. The boundary conditions are u(0,t) = u(10,t) = 0 for t > 0, and the initial condition is u(x,0) = 20 for 0 < x < 10.\n\nFirst, we assume a solution of the form u(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 25X''(x)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by 25XT, we get:\n\nT'(t) / (25T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nT'(t) + 25λ²T(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions X(0) = X(10) = 0, we get:\n\nA = 0\nB*sin(λ*10) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise X(x) would be identically zero), we must have sin(λ*10) = 0. This implies that λ*10 = nπ for some integer n. Thus, λ = nπ/10.\n\nNow we have:\n\nX_n(x) = B_n*sin(nπx/10)\n\nSolving the second equation, we get the general solution:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n*exp(-25*(nπ/10)²*t)\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nu_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = C_n*sin(nπx/10)*exp(-25*(nπ/10)²*t)\n\nNow we need to find the coefficients C_n using the initial condition u(x,0) = 20. We have:\n\n20 = Σ[C_n*sin(nπx/10)]\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, so we can find the coefficients C_n using the formula:\n\nC_n = (2/L) * ∫[u(x,0)*sin(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L\n\nHere, L = 10. So,\n\nC_n = (1/5) * ∫[20*sin(nπx/10)]dx from 0 to 10\n\nC_n = (1/5) * [(-10/nπ)*(cos(nπx/10))] from 0 to 10\n\nC_n = (1/5) * [(-10/nπ)*(cos(nπ) - cos(0))]\n\nC_n = (20/nπ) for odd n, and 0 for even n.\n\nFinally, the solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[(20/nπ)*sin(nπx/10)*exp(-25*(nπ/10)²*t)] for odd n\n\nThis is the temperature distribution along the rod at any time t. To find the distribution at t = 5 seconds, plug in t = 5:\n\nu(x,5) = Σ[(20/nπ)*sin(nπx/10)*exp(-25*(nπ/10)²*5)] for odd n\n\nThis series converges quickly, so you can approximate the distribution by taking the first few terms."
