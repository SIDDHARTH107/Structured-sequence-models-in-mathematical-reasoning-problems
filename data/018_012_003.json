In this case, the second element should be either 2 or 3.\n\nSo, (A×B)∩B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\nNow, let's find B∩A.\n\nB∩A = {2} (since 2 is the only element common to both sets A and B)\n\nNow, let's find (B∩A)×B.\n\n(B∩A)×B = {2}×{2,3} = {(2,2), (2,3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A×B)∩B ≠ (B∩A)×B, which shows that the order of sets in the Cartesian product matters when it comes to intersection."
