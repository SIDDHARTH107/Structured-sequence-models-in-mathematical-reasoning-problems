    "message_1": "Suppose a student has to choose between two math textbooks. The first textbook costs $50 but has a 70% chance of helping them ace their next test. The second textbook costs $30 but only has a 40% chance of helping them ace their next test. Assuming that acing the test is worth $100 to the student, which textbook should they choose to maximize their expected utility?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the expected utility, we need to calculate the expected value for each textbook and compare them. The expected value is calculated as the probability of success multiplied by the value of success, minus the cost of the textbook.\n\nFor the first textbook:\nExpected value = (Probability of success * Value of success) - Cost of textbook\nExpected value = (0.70 * $100) - $50\nExpected value = $70 - $50\nExpected value = $20\n\nFor the second textbook:\nExpected value = (Probability of success * Value of success) - Cost of textbook\nExpected value = (0.40 * $100) - $30\nExpected value = $40 - $30\nExpected value = $10\n\nSince the expected value of the first textbook ($20) is greater than the expected value of the second textbook ($10), the student should choose the first textbook to maximize their expected utility."
