    "message_2": "To determine the number of faces in the simplicial complex X, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 6 and E = 10. Plugging these values into Euler's formula, we get:\n\n6 - 10 + F = 2\n\nSolving for F, we find:\n\nF = 6\n\nSo, the simplicial complex X has 6 faces."
