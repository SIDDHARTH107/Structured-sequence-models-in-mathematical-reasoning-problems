    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B. A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}.\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∩ B. Since B = {2, 3}, we are looking for pairs in A × B that have either 2 or 3 as their second element. We have:\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)} ∩ {2, 3} = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nNext, let's find B ∩ A. B ∩ A = {2, 3} ∩ {1, 2} = {2}. Now, let's find A × (B ∩ A):\n\nA × (B ∩ A) = A × {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2)}\n\nNow, let's show that the Cartesian product of sets A, B, and C is not associative with respect to intersection. Let C = {3, 4}. We will find (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) and show that they are not equal.\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 2), 3), ((1, 2), 4), ((1, 3), 3), ((1, 3), 4), ((2, 2), 3), ((2, 2), 4), ((2, 3), 3), ((2, 3), 4)}\n\nB × C = {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (2, 3)), (1, (2, 4)), (1, (3, 3)), (1, (3, 4)), (2, (2, 3)), (2, (2, 4)), (2, (3, 3)), (2, (3, 4))}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) × C ≠ A × (B × C). Therefore, the Cartesian product of sets A, B, and C is not associative with respect to intersection."
