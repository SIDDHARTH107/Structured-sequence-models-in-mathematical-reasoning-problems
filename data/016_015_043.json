    "message_2": "The Hilbert Curve is a space-filling curve that increases in length as its order increases. The length of the Hilbert Curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength of order n = (Length of order 1) * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the length of the curve of order 1 is 2, and we want to find the length of the curve of order 5.\n\nLength of order 5 = 2 * (2^5)\n\nLength of order 5 = 2 * 32\n\nLength of order 5 = 64\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert Curve of order 5 is 64."
