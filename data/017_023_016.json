    "message_1": "Suppose G is a group of order 72. How many distinct non-isomorphic groups are there of order 72?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of G is 72, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2. Therefore, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, there are three possibilities for their order: 2, 4, or 8. For the Sylow 3-subgroups, there are two possibilities for their order: 3 or 9. This gives us a total of 3 * 2 = 6 possible combinations of Sylow subgroups.\n\nHowever, not all of these combinations will result in distinct non-isomorphic groups. We can use the Sylow theorems to further analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If the order of the Sylow 2-subgroup is 2 and the order of the Sylow 3-subgroup is 3, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 2 and 3, which is the cyclic group of order 6. This is not possible since the order of G is 72.\n\n2. If the order of the Sylow 2-subgroup is 4 and the order of the Sylow 3-subgroup is 3, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 4 and 3, which is the cyclic group of order 12. This is also not possible since the order of G is 72.\n\n3. If the order of the Sylow 2-subgroup is 8 and the order of the Sylow 3-subgroup is 3, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 8 and 3, which is the cyclic group of order 24. This is also not possible since the order of G is 72.\n\n4. If the order of the Sylow 2-subgroup is 2 and the order of the Sylow 3-subgroup is 9, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 2 and 9, which is the cyclic group of order 18. This is also not possible since the order of G is 72.\n\n5. If the order of the Sylow 2-subgroup is 4 and the order of the Sylow 3-subgroup is 9, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 4 and 9. There are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup: the cyclic group of order 4 (C4) and the Klein four-group (V). There is only one possibility for the Sylow 3-subgroup: the cyclic group of order 9 (C9). This gives us two distinct non-isomorphic groups: C4 x C9 and V x C9.\n\n6. If the order of the Sylow 2-subgroup is 8 and the order of the Sylow 3-subgroup is 9, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 8 and 9. There are five possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup: the cyclic group of order 8 (C8), the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 (C2 x C2), the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 (C4 x C4), the dihedral group of order 8 (D8), and the quaternion group of order 8 (Q8). There is only one possibility for the Sylow 3-subgroup: the cyclic group of order 9 (C9). This gives us five distinct non-isomorphic groups: C8 x C9, (C2 x C2) x C9, (C4 x C4) x C9, D8 x C9, and Q8 x C9.\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 5 = 7 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
