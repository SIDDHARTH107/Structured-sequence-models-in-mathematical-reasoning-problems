    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the curve y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7 over the field of real numbers, we need to analyze the behavior of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points of the function by taking the derivative of x^3 - 5x + 7 with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 5\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 to find the critical points:\n\n3x^2 - 5 = 0\nx^2 = 5/3\nx = ±√(5/3)\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of the function around these critical points. When x < -√(5/3), the function is decreasing. When -√(5/3) < x < √(5/3), the function is increasing. When x > √(5/3), the function is decreasing again.\n\nSince the function is continuous and has a single local minimum and a single local maximum, there must be at least one real root between the local minimum and local maximum. Additionally, since the function is decreasing for x < -√(5/3) and x > √(5/3), there must be one real root in each of these intervals as well.\n\nNow, let's find the y-values for each of these roots. For each real root x, there will be two corresponding y-values (positive and negative) since y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 real roots for x, and each root has 2 corresponding y-values. So, there are 3 * 2 = 6 points on the curve over the field of real numbers."
