    "message_2": "To solve the given second-order nonlinear differential equation with the initial conditions, we can use the method of reduction of order. \n\nGiven: y'' + y^3 = 0\nInitial conditions: y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0\n\nLet's introduce a new function v(x) such that y'(x) = v(x). Then, the second derivative y''(x) can be written as the derivative of v(x) with respect to x, i.e., y''(x) = v'(x).\n\nNow, the given differential equation becomes:\n\nv'(x) + y(x)^3 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\nv'(x) = -y(x)^3\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫v'(x) dx = ∫-y(x)^3 dx\n\nv(x) = -∫y(x)^3 dx + C₁\n\nNow, we use the initial condition y'(0) = v(0) = 0:\n\n0 = -∫y(0)^3 d(0) + C₁\n\nC₁ = 0\n\nSo, v(x) = -∫y(x)^3 dx\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to x again:\n\n∫y'(x) dx = ∫v(x) dx = -∫(∫y(x)^3 dx) dx\n\ny(x) = -∫(∫y(x)^3 dx) dx + C₂\n\nNow, we use the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n1 = -∫(∫y(0)^3 d(0)) d(0) + C₂\n\nC₂ = 1\n\nSo, the particular solution y(x) that satisfies the given initial conditions is:\n\ny(x) = 1 - ∫(∫y(x)^3 dx) dx\n\nHowever, this equation is an implicit solution, and it is not possible to find an explicit solution for y(x) in terms of elementary functions. The solution can be expressed in terms of special functions or approximated numerically."
