    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players in a signaling game: the sender and the receiver. The sender has two types, A and B, and the receiver must choose between two actions, X and Y. The payoff matrix for the game is as follows:\n\n```\n        X       Y\nA       2, 0    0, 1\nB       1, 0    0, 2\n```\n\nIf the sender is type A with probability 0.6 and type B with probability 0.4, find the optimal strategy for the receiver.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for the receiver, we need to calculate the expected payoffs for each action (X and Y) and choose the action with the highest expected payoff.\n\nExpected payoff for action X:\nE(X) = P(A) * Payoff(X|A) + P(B) * Payoff(X|B)\nE(X) = 0.6 * 0 + 0.4 * 0 = 0\n\nExpected payoff for action Y:\nE(Y) = P(A) * Payoff(Y|A) + P(B) * Payoff(Y|B)\nE(Y) = 0.6 * 1 + 0.4 * 2 = 0.6 + 0.8 = 1.4\n\nSince the expected payoff for action Y (1.4) is greater than the expected payoff for action X (0), the optimal strategy for the receiver is to choose action Y."
