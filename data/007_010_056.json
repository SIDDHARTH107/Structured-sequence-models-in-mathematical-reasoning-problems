    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\nN1 = N/5 = 35/5 = 7\nN2 = N/7 = 35/7 = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\n7 * x1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n5 * x2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nBy inspection or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find:\nx1 = 3 (since 7 * 3 = 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\nx2 = 3 (since 5 * 3 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nNow, we can compute the solution x:\nx = (3 * 7 * 3) + (4 * 5 * 3) = 63 + 60 = 123\n\nHowever, we are looking for the smallest positive value of x, so we need to find the smallest positive integer that is congruent to 123 modulo 35. To do this, we can simply subtract multiples of 35 from 123 until we get a positive number:\n\n123 - 35 = 88\n88 - 35 = 53\n53 - 35 = 18\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of x is 18."
