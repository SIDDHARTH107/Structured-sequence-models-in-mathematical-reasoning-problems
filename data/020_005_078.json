    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has two assembly lines for producing two different products: Product A and Product B. The company must produce at least 100 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B per week. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours on Assembly Line 1 and 2 hours on Assembly Line 2 to complete, while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours on Assembly Line 1 and 4 hours on Assembly Line 2 to complete. The company has 500 hours of Assembly Line 1 and 700 hours of Assembly Line 2 available per week. What is the maximum number of units of Product A and Product B that the company can produce per week under these constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x >= 100 (at least 100 units of Product A)\n2. y >= 150 (at least 150 units of Product B)\n3. 3x + 2y <= 500 (Assembly Line 1 constraint)\n4. 2x + 4y <= 700 (Assembly Line 2 constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of units produced, which is x + y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify constraint 4 by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n2. x + 2y <= 350\n\nNow let's solve the system of inequalities graphically.\n\n1. x >= 100: This is a vertical line at x = 100. To the right of this line, the inequality is satisfied.\n2. y >= 150: This is a horizontal line at y = 150. Above this line, the inequality is satisfied.\n3. 3x + 2y <= 500: This is a line with slope -3/2 and y-intercept 250. Below this line, the inequality is satisfied.\n4. x + 2y <= 350: This is a line with slope -1/2 and y-intercept 175. Below this line, the inequality is satisfied.\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all these half-planes. The vertices of this region are the points where the boundary lines intersect. We have the following vertices:\n\nA. (100, 150)\nB. (100, 175)\nC. (140, 160)\nD. (200, 75)\n\nNow we evaluate the objective function (x + y) at each vertex:\n\nA. 100 + 150 = 250\nB. 100 + 175 = 275\nC. 140 + 160 = 300\nD. 200 + 75 = 275\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 300, which occurs at vertex C. Therefore, the company can produce a maximum of 140 units of Product A and 160 units of Product B per week under these constraints."
