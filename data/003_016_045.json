    "message_2": "The phase shift of a trigonometric function is the horizontal shift applied to the function. In general, for a function of the form f(x) = A*cos(Bx - C), the phase shift can be calculated as C/B.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 2cos(3x - π/4), so A = 2, B = 3, and C = π/4. To find the phase shift, we can use the formula:\n\nPhase shift = C/B = (π/4) / 3 = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function f(x) = 2cos(3x - π/4) is π/12."
