    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Let B be the complement of set A, such that B = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. What is the intersection of set A and its complement B? Show that the intersection of set A and its complement is the empty set.",
    "message_2": "The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, set A contains the elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and set B, which is the complement of set A, contains the elements {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. \n\nSince the elements in set A are all different from the elements in set B, there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, the intersection of set A and its complement B is the empty set, denoted as âˆ… or {}."
