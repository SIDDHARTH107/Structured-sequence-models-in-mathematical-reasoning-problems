    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x + 13 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (Δ):\n\nΔ = b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4(1)(13) = 16 - 52 = -36\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we know that the solutions will involve complex numbers.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-4 ± 6i) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify:\n\nx = -2 ± 3i\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = -2 + 3i and x = -2 - 3i"
