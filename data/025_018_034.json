    "message_2": "Mori theory is a part of algebraic geometry that deals with the classification of algebraic varieties, and it is not the appropriate tool for finding the number of rational points on an algebraic curve. Instead, we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem, which states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated.\n\nThe given equation is an elliptic curve in the form:\n$$y^2 = x^3 - 4x = x(x^2 - 4) = x(x-2)(x+2)$$\n\nTo find the rational points on this curve, we can use a systematic approach. First, we can consider the cases where $x$ is a rational number.\n\n1. If $x = 0$, then $y^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$. The point $(0, 0)$ is a rational point on the curve.\n\n2. If $x = 2$, then $y^2 = 2^3 - 4\\cdot2 = 8 - 8 = 0$, so $y = 0$. The point $(2, 0)$ is a rational point on the curve.\n\n3. If $x = -2$, then $y^2 = (-2)^3 - 4\\cdot(-2) = -8 + 8 = 0$, so $y = 0$. The point $(-2, 0)$ is a rational point on the curve.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where $x$ is not equal to $0$, $2$, or $-2$. In this case, we can factor the equation as:\n$$y^2 = x(x-2)(x+2)$$\n\nSince $x$, $x-2$, and $x+2$ are pairwise coprime, their squares must also be pairwise coprime. Therefore, we can write:\n$$x = a^2$$\n$$(x-2) = b^2$$\n$$(x+2) = c^2$$\n\nfor some rational numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$. From the second and third equations, we have:\n$$c^2 - b^2 = 4$$\n\nNow, we can use the difference of squares factorization:\n$$(c+b)(c-b) = 4$$\n\nSince $c$ and $b$ are rational numbers, there are only a few possibilities for the factors of $4$:\n\n- $c+b = 4$ and $c-b = 1$. Solving for $c$ and $b$, we get $c = \\frac{5}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{3}{2}$. This gives $x = 9/4$ and $y = \\pm\\frac{15}{4}$, so the points $(\\frac{9}{4}, \\pm\\frac{15}{4})$ are rational points on the curve.\n\n- $c+b = -4$ and $c-b = -1$. Solving for $c$ and $b$, we get $c = -\\frac{5}{2}$ and $b = -\\frac{3}{2}$. This gives $x = 9/4$ and $y = \\pm\\frac{15}{4}$, which are the same points as in the previous case.\n\n- $c+b = 2$ and $c-b = 2$. Solving for $c$ and $b$, we get $c = 2$ and $b = 0$. This gives $x = 2$ and $y = 0$, which is the point $(2, 0)$ that we already found.\n\n- $c+b = -2$ and $c-b = -2$. Solving for $c$ and $b$, we get $c = -2$ and $b = 0$. This gives $x = -2$ and $y = 0$, which is the point $(-2, 0)$ that we already found.\n\nThus, the rational points on the curve are $(0, 0)$, $(2, 0)$, $(-2, 0)$, $(\\frac{9}{4}, \\frac{15}{4})$, and $(\\frac{9}{4}, -\\frac{15}{4})$. There are 5 rational points on the curve."
