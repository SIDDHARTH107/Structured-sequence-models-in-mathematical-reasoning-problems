    "message_2": "To solve the given complex differential equation, we can first rewrite it as a first-order linear differential equation:\n\n$$\\frac{dw}{dz} + \\frac{3z^2w}{z^2+1} = 0$$\n\nNow, we can find an integrating factor, which is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of $w$:\n\n$$\\text{Integrating factor} = e^{\\int \\frac{3z^2}{z^2+1} dz}$$\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use the substitution method. Let $u = z^2 + 1$, then $du = 2z dz$. Thus, the integral becomes:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{3z^2}{z^2+1} dz = \\int \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{du}{u} = \\frac{3}{2} \\ln|u| + C = \\frac{3}{2} \\ln|z^2+1| + C$$\n\nNow, the integrating factor is:\n\n$$e^{\\frac{3}{2} \\ln|z^2+1|} = (z^2+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}$$\n\nNext, we multiply the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\n$$(z^2+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\frac{dw}{dz} + 3z^2(z^2+1)^{\\frac{1}{2}}w = 0$$\n\nNow, the left-hand side of the equation is the derivative of the product of $w(z)$ and the integrating factor:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dz}\\left[w(z)(z^2+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right] = 0$$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$$w(z)(z^2+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = C$$\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition $w(1) = 2 + i$ to find the constant $C$:\n\n$$(2+i)(1^2+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = C \\Rightarrow C = (2+i)(2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 4(2+i)$$\n\nFinally, we can find the solution $w(z)$ by dividing both sides by the integrating factor:\n\n$$w(z) = \\frac{C}{(z^2+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{4(2+i)}{(z^2+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$$\n\nSo, the solution to the complex differential equation that satisfies the given initial condition is:\n\n$$w(z) = \\frac{4(2+i)}{(z^2+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$$"
