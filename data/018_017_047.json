    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}. Find (A △ B) x {2}, (A x {2}) △ (B x {2}) and check if they are equal, where △ denotes symmetric difference and x denotes Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. So, A △ B = {1, 3}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and {2}. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set. So, (A △ B) x {2} = {(1, 2), (3, 2)}.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products A x {2} and B x {2}. A x {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2)} and B x {2} = {(2, 2), (3, 2)}.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A x {2}) and (B x {2}). (A x {2}) △ (B x {2}) = {(1, 2), (3, 2)}.\n\nFinally, let's compare the two results: (A △ B) x {2} = {(1, 2), (3, 2)} and (A x {2}) △ (B x {2}) = {(1, 2), (3, 2)}. Since both sets are equal, we can conclude that (A △ B) x {2} = (A x {2}) △ (B x {2})."
