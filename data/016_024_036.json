    "message_2": "A Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from a larger square. In the first iteration, the middle square of the 3x3 grid is removed, leaving 8 smaller squares. In the second iteration, the middle square of each of these 8 smaller squares is removed, leaving 8 smaller squares in each of the original 8 squares.\n\nSo, after the first two iterations, there are 8 (from the first iteration) * 8 (from the second iteration) = 64 smaller versions of the Sierpinski carpet inside the 3x3 Sierpinski carpet."
