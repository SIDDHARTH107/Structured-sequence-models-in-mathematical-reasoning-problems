    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of having exactly x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 5 (the number of free throws)\n- x = 3 (the number of successful free throws)\n- p = 0.6 (the probability of making a free throw)\n- (1-p) = 0.4 (the probability of missing a free throw)\n\nFirst, let's find C(5, 3), which is the number of combinations of 5 items taken 3 at a time:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!)\nC(5, 3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(3) = C(5, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(5-3)\nP(3) = 10 * (0.6)^3 * (0.4)^2\nP(3) = 10 * 0.216 * 0.16\nP(3) = 10 * 0.03456\nP(3) â‰ˆ 0.3456\n\nSo, the probability that the player will make exactly three out of their next five free throws is approximately 34.56%."
