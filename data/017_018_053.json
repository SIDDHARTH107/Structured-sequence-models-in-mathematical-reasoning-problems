    "message_2": "To determine which of the given groups is isomorphic to a given group, we can analyze their structures and properties.\n\na) C32: This is the cyclic group of order 32. It is abelian, and its elements have orders that are divisors of 32. The possible orders of elements are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.\n\nb) D16: This is the dihedral group of order 32 (since the order of a dihedral group D_n is 2n). It is non-abelian and has elements of orders 1, 2, and 4. It has 16 reflections (order 2) and 16 rotations (order 1, 2, and 4).\n\nc) G: This is a non-abelian group of order 32, up to isomorphism. Since it is non-abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C32. \n\nNow, we need to determine if G is isomorphic to D16. One way to do this is to analyze the number of elements of each order in both groups. If the number of elements of each order is the same in both groups, then they may be isomorphic.\n\nFor D16, we have:\n- 1 element of order 1 (identity)\n- 15 elements of order 2 (reflections)\n- 2 elements of order 4 (rotations)\n- 14 elements of order 8 (rotations)\n\nFor G, we don't have specific information about the number of elements of each order. However, since G is non-abelian and has order 32, it must have at least one element of order greater than 4 (otherwise, it would be a direct product of smaller abelian groups, which would make it abelian).\n\nSince D16 has no elements of order greater than 4, and G must have at least one element of order greater than 4, G cannot be isomorphic to D16.\n\nTherefore, the given group is not isomorphic to any of the groups a), b), or c)."
