    "message_2": "To show that f(z) is a constant function, we will use the maximum modulus principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic (analytic) in a bounded domain and continuous up to its boundary, then the maximum of its modulus is attained on the boundary.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given inequality as:\n\n|f(z)| * e^(-|z|) ≤ 1 for all z ∈ ℂ.\n\nNow, let g(z) = f(z) * e^(-z). g(z) is also an entire function since it is a product of two entire functions, f(z) and e^(-z).\n\nConsider the function h(z) = |g(z)| = |f(z)| * e^(-|z|). h(z) is a non-negative continuous function on the complex plane. We want to show that h(z) has a maximum value.\n\nLet R be a positive real number. Consider the circle |z| = R. On this circle, we have:\n\n|h(z)| = |f(z)| * e^(-|z|) ≤ e^|z| * e^(-|z|) = 1.\n\nAs R goes to infinity, the function h(z) is bounded by 1 on the circle |z| = R. Therefore, h(z) is bounded on the entire complex plane.\n\nNow, we apply the maximum modulus principle to the function g(z) on the disk |z| ≤ R. Since g(z) is holomorphic inside the disk and continuous up to its boundary, the maximum of |g(z)| is attained on the boundary, i.e., on the circle |z| = R.\n\nHowever, we have already shown that |g(z)| is bounded by 1 on the circle |z| = R. Thus, the maximum value of |g(z)| on the disk |z| ≤ R is also bounded by 1. Since R is arbitrary, this implies that |g(z)| is bounded by 1 on the entire complex plane.\n\nNow, we use Liouville's theorem, which states that a bounded entire function is constant. Since g(z) is entire and |g(z)| is bounded, g(z) must be a constant function. Let g(z) = C, where C is a complex constant.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\nf(z) = g(z) * e^z = C * e^z.\n\nSince C is a constant, f(z) is a constant function times e^z. However, we are given that |f(z)| ≤ e^|z|, which implies that the constant function must be equal to C. Therefore, f(z) is a constant function."
