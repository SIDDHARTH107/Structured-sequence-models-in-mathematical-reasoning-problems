    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 32, we first need to consider the possible group structures. Since 32 = 2^5, we will be looking at groups of p-groups with p = 2. The possible structures for groups of order 32 are given by the partitions of 5, which are:\n\n1. [5]\n2. [4, 1]\n3. [3, 2]\n4. [3, 1, 1]\n5. [2, 2, 1]\n6. [2, 1, 1, 1]\n7. [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nNow, we can eliminate some of these structures as they correspond to abelian groups:\n\n1. [5] corresponds to the cyclic group of order 32, which is abelian.\n6. [2, 1, 1, 1] corresponds to the direct product of Z_4 and Z_8, which is abelian.\n7. [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] corresponds to the direct product of five copies of Z_2, which is abelian.\n\nThis leaves us with the following structures to consider for non-abelian groups:\n\n2. [4, 1]\n3. [3, 2]\n4. [3, 1, 1]\n5. [2, 2, 1]\n\nNow, we will analyze each of these structures and determine the corresponding non-abelian groups.\n\n2. [4, 1]: This structure corresponds to a semi-direct product of Z_2 and Z_16. There are two non-abelian groups with this structure: the dihedral group D16 and the semi-dihedral group SD16.\n\n3. [3, 2]: This structure corresponds to a semi-direct product of Z_4 and Z_8. There is one non-abelian group with this structure: the quaternion group Q16.\n\n4. [3, 1, 1]: This structure corresponds to a semi-direct product of Z_2, Z_2, and Z_8. However, there are no non-abelian groups with this structure.\n\n5. [2, 2, 1]: This structure corresponds to a semi-direct product of Z_4, Z_4, and Z_2. However, there are no non-abelian groups with this structure.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three non-abelian groups of order 32, and they are isomorphic to the following groups:\n\n1. D16: The dihedral group of order 32.\n2. Q16: The quaternion group of order 16.\n3. SD16: The semi-dihedral group of order 32."
