    "message_1": "In a Bertrand competition, two firms sell an identical product at a price that depends on the competitors' price. The cost of production for each firm is $10. Suppose the demand function is given by Q = 100 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price charged. Calculate the Nash equilibrium price and profit for both firms.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium price and profit for both firms in a Bertrand competition, we need to first determine the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the optimal price a firm should charge given the price charged by its competitor.\n\nLet P1 be the price charged by Firm 1 and P2 be the price charged by Firm 2. The profit function for Firm 1 is given by:\n\nΠ1 = (P1 - 10) * Q1\n\nSince the demand function is Q = 100 - P, we can rewrite the profit function as:\n\nΠ1 = (P1 - 10) * (100 - P1)\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the first-order condition by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to P1 and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndΠ1/dP1 = (100 - P1) - 2(P1 - 10) = 0\n\nSolving for P1, we get:\n\nP1 = (100 + 20) / 3 = 40\n\nSimilarly, we can find the reaction function for Firm 2:\n\nΠ2 = (P2 - 10) * (100 - P2)\n\ndΠ2/dP2 = (100 - P2) - 2(P2 - 10) = 0\n\nP2 = (100 + 20) / 3 = 40\n\nIn the Nash equilibrium, both firms will charge the same price, P1 = P2 = 40. Now, we can calculate the quantity demanded and profit for both firms.\n\nThe demand function is Q = 100 - P, so:\n\nQ = 100 - 40 = 60\n\nSince both firms sell an identical product, they will split the market demand equally. Therefore, the quantity demanded for each firm is:\n\nQ1 = Q2 = 60 / 2 = 30\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit for both firms:\n\nΠ1 = (P1 - 10) * Q1 = (40 - 10) * 30 = 30 * 30 = 900\n\nΠ2 = (P2 - 10) * Q2 = (40 - 10) * 30 = 30 * 30 = 900\n\nIn the Nash equilibrium, both firms will charge a price of $40 and earn a profit of $900 each."
