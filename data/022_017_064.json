    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first find the complementary solution by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\ny''(x) + 5y'(x) + 6y(x) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\nr^2 + 5r + 6 = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(r + 2)(r + 3) = 0\n\nSo, the roots are r1 = -2 and r2 = -3. The complementary solution is:\n\nyc(x) = C1 * e^(-2x) + C2 * e^(-3x)\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation. Since the right-hand side of the equation is 12e^(-2x), we assume a particular solution of the form:\n\nyp(x) = (A + Bx) * e^(-2x)\n\nTaking the first derivative:\n\nyp'(x) = (-2A - 2Bx + B) * e^(-2x)\n\nTaking the second derivative:\n\nyp''(x) = (4A + 4Bx - 4B) * e^(-2x)\n\nNow, we substitute yp(x), yp'(x), and yp''(x) into the original non-homogeneous equation:\n\n(4A + 4Bx - 4B) * e^(-2x) + 5(-2A - 2Bx + B) * e^(-2x) + 6(A + Bx) * e^(-2x) = 12e^(-2x)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(4A - 10A + 6A + 4Bx - 10Bx + 6Bx) * e^(-2x) = 12e^(-2x)\n\nComparing the coefficients of e^(-2x) and x * e^(-2x), we have:\n\n-2A = 12 => A = -6\n-6B = 0 => B = 0\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nyp(x) = -6 * e^(-2x)\n\nFinally, the general solution of the given differential equation is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\ny(x) = C1 * e^(-2x) + C2 * e^(-3x) - 6 * e^(-2x)\n\ny(x) = (C1 - 6) * e^(-2x) + C2 * e^(-3x)\n\nHere, C1 and C2 are constants determined by the initial conditions or boundary conditions of the problem."
