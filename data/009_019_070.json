    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of hitting times and the reflection principle for Brownian motion. Let τ₁ be the hitting time of X = 2 and τ₂ be the hitting time of X = -1. We want to find the probability P(τ₁ < τ₂).\n\nFirst, we will transform the given stochastic differential equation (SDE) into a standard Brownian motion. Define a new process Y(t) = e^(2t)X(t). Then, apply Ito's lemma to find the SDE for Y(t):\n\ndY(t) = e^(2t)dX(t) + 2e^(2t)X(t)dt\n\nSubstitute the given SDE for dX(t):\n\ndY(t) = e^(2t)(-2X(t)dt + 3dB(t)) + 2e^(2t)X(t)dt\n\ndY(t) = 3e^(2t)dB(t)\n\nNow, Y(t) is a process with constant coefficient in front of the Brownian motion dB(t). The hitting times for Y(t) are τ₁' = inf{t ≥ 0: Y(t) = e^(2t) * 2} and τ₂' = inf{t ≥ 0: Y(t) = e^(2t) * (-1)}. We want to find the probability P(τ₁' < τ₂').\n\nHowever, since Y(t) is always positive due to the exponential term e^(2t), the process Y(t) will never hit the level e^(2t) * (-1). Therefore, τ₂' = ∞, and the probability P(τ₁' < τ₂') = 1.\n\nNow, we need to transform this result back to the original process X(t). Since Y(t) = e^(2t)X(t), we have X(t) = e^(-2t)Y(t). Thus, the hitting times for X(t) are τ₁ = inf{t ≥ 0: X(t) = 2} and τ₂ = inf{t ≥ 0: X(t) = -1}. We want to find the probability P(τ₁ < τ₂).\n\nHowever, since X(t) = e^(-2t)Y(t) and Y(t) is always positive, the process X(t) will never hit the level -1. Therefore, τ₂ = ∞, and the probability P(τ₁ < τ₂) = 1.\n\nSo, the probability that the particle crosses the point X = 2 before it crosses the point X = -1 is 1."
