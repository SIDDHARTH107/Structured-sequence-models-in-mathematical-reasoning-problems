    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of harmonic 1-forms on a connected and smooth closed surface with genus g, we will use De Rham cohomology and the Hodge decomposition theorem.\n\nThe Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a compact Riemannian manifold M, the space of differential forms Ω^k(M) can be decomposed into the direct sum of three subspaces: the space of exact forms, the space of coexact forms, and the space of harmonic forms. In other words, Ω^k(M) = dΩ^(k-1)(M) ⊕ δΩ^(k+1)(M) ⊕ H^k(M), where H^k(M) is the space of harmonic k-forms.\n\nFor a connected and smooth closed surface with genus g, we are interested in the space of harmonic 1-forms, H^1(M). By the Hodge decomposition theorem, we know that H^1(M) is isomorphic to the first De Rham cohomology group, H^1(M; R). The dimension of H^1(M; R) is given by the first Betti number, b_1(M).\n\nNow, let's compute b_1(M) for a surface of genus g. Recall that the Betti numbers are topological invariants, and they can be computed using the Euler characteristic. For a connected and smooth closed surface with genus g, the Euler characteristic is given by χ(M) = 2 - 2g. The Betti numbers satisfy the relation χ(M) = b_0(M) - b_1(M) + b_2(M). Since M is connected, b_0(M) = 1, and since M is a closed surface, b_2(M) = 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n2 - 2g = 1 - b_1(M) + 1\nb_1(M) = 2g\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of harmonic 1-forms on a connected and smooth closed surface with genus g is 2g."
