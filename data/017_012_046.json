    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16 with exactly 8 elements of order 2. Since the order of G is a power of 2, G must be a p-group, where p = 2. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, the isomorphism classes of abelian groups of order 16 are:\n\n1. Z_16\n2. Z_8 ⊕ Z_2\n3. Z_4 ⊕ Z_4\n4. Z_4 ⊕ Z_2 ⊕ Z_2\n5. Z_2 ⊕ Z_2 ⊕ Z_2 ⊕ Z_2\n\nWe can eliminate options 1, 2, and 3 because they do not have exactly 8 elements of order 2:\n\n1. Z_16 has only one element of order 2.\n2. Z_8 ⊕ Z_2 has 4 elements of order 2.\n3. Z_4 ⊕ Z_4 has 4 elements of order 2.\n\nNow let's analyze options 4 and 5:\n\n4. Z_4 ⊕ Z_2 ⊕ Z_2: This group has elements of the form (a, b, c), where a ∈ Z_4, b ∈ Z_2, and c ∈ Z_2. The elements of order 2 are those for which (a, b, c)^2 = (1, 1, 1). This occurs when a = 2 (mod 4), b = 1 (mod 2), and c = 1 (mod 2). There are 2 choices for a (2 and 6), 2 choices for b (1), and 2 choices for c (1), giving a total of 2 × 1 × 1 = 2 elements of order 2. This does not match the requirement of having 8 elements of order 2.\n\n5. Z_2 ⊕ Z_2 ⊕ Z_2 ⊕ Z_2: This group has elements of the form (a, b, c, d), where a, b, c, d ∈ Z_2. The elements of order 2 are those for which (a, b, c, d)^2 = (1, 1, 1, 1). This occurs when a = 1 (mod 2), b = 1 (mod 2), c = 1 (mod 2), and d = 1 (mod 2). There are 2 choices for each of a, b, c, and d (0 and 1), giving a total of 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16 elements. However, we need to subtract the identity element (0, 0, 0, 0), which has order 1, leaving us with 15 elements. Out of these 15 elements, 8 of them have an odd number of 1's in their tuple (e.g., (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1, 1), etc.), and these are the elements of order 2. Thus, this group has exactly 8 elements of order 2.\n\nTherefore, the isomorphism class of a group of order 16 that has exactly 8 elements of order 2 is Z_2 ⊕ Z_2 ⊕ Z_2 ⊕ Z_2."
