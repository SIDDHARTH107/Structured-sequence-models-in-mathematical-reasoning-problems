    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer solution to the equation 5x + 12y = 1, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFirst, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 12 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n12 = 2 * 5 + 2\n5 = 2 * 2 + 1\n\nSo, the GCD(5, 12) = 1.\n\nNow, use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients x and y:\n\n1 = 5 - 2 * 2\n1 = 5 - 2 * (12 - 2 * 5)\n1 = 5 * 5 - 2 * 12\n\nSo, x = 5 and y = -2.\n\nHowever, we need the smallest positive integer solution. To find this, we can use the fact that the general solution to the equation 5x + 12y = 1 is given by:\n\nx = x0 + k * (12/GCD(5, 12))\ny = y0 - k * (5/GCD(5, 12))\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the initial coefficients we found (x0 = 5, y0 = -2), k is an integer, and GCD(5, 12) = 1.\n\nWe want to find the smallest positive integer value for x, so we need to find the smallest integer k such that x = 5 + 12k > 0. The smallest value of k that satisfies this condition is k = 0, which gives x = 5.\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = -2 - 0 * (5/1) = -2\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer solution to the equation 5x + 12y = 1 is x = 5 and y = -2."
