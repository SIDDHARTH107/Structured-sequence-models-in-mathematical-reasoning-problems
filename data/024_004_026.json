    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 - 4 at the point (1, 1, -2), we first need to find the first and second partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y.\n\nLet's find the first partial derivatives:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we need to compute the mean curvature H using the following formula:\n\nH = (1/2) * (E∂²z/∂x² + 2F∂²z/∂x∂y + G∂²z/∂y²) / (EG - F²)\n\nwhere E = 1 + (∂z/∂x)², F = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y), and G = 1 + (∂z/∂y)².\n\nAt the point (1, 1, -2), we have:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2(1) = 2\n∂z/∂y = 2(1) = 2\n\nSo, E = 1 + (2)² = 5, F = (2)(2) = 4, and G = 1 + (2)² = 5.\n\nNow, we can compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/2) * (5(2) + 2(4)(0) + 5(2)) / (5 * 5 - 4²)\nH = (1/2) * (10 + 0 + 10) / (25 - 16)\nH = (1/2) * 20 / 9\nH = 10 / 9\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 - 4 at the point (1, 1, -2) is H = 10/9."
