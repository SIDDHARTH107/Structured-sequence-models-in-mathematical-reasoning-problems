In this case, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nNow, we need to verify if this intersection is a subset of both A and B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if all elements of set X are also elements of set Y, then set X is a subset of set Y.\n\nChecking if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\nAll elements in A ∩ B = {3, 4} are also elements of A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nChecking if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\nAll elements in A ∩ B = {3, 4} are also elements of B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B) is a subset of both A and B."
