    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every vertex is visited exactly once, and the starting and ending vertices are the same.\n\nIn a complete graph with 6 vertices (also known as K6), there are multiple Hamiltonian cycles. One possible Hamiltonian cycle can be represented by visiting the vertices in the following order:\n\n1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 1\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. There are other Hamiltonian cycles in K6 as well, but this is one example."
