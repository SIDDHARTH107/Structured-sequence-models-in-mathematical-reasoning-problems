    "message_2": "To find the normalization constant A, we need to ensure that the probability of finding the particle in the given interval [0, L] is equal to 1. This is done by integrating the square of the wave function over the interval and setting it equal to 1:\n\n$$1 = \\int_{0}^{L} |\\psi(x)|^2 dx = \\int_{0}^{L} (A\\cos(kx))^2 dx$$\n\nNow, we need to solve this integral:\n\n$$1 = A^2 \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos^2(kx) dx$$\n\nWe can use the identity $\\cos^2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2x))$ to simplify the integral:\n\n$$1 = A^2 \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2kx)) dx$$\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n$$1 = A^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(x + \\frac{1}{4k}\\sin(2kx))\\right]_{0}^{L}$$\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n\n$$1 = A^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(L + \\frac{1}{4k}\\sin(2kL)) - \\frac{1}{2}(0 + \\frac{1}{4k}\\sin(0))\\right]$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$1 = A^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{2}L + \\frac{1}{8k}\\sin(2kL)\\right]$$\n\nNow, we need to find A. Since the particle is confined between x=0 and x=L, we have a boundary condition that the wave function must be zero at x=0 and x=L. This means that:\n\n$$\\cos(kL) = 0$$\n\nThis condition is satisfied when $kL = (2n + 1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where n is an integer. For the lowest energy state, we can take n=0, so:\n\n$$kL = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\n\nNow, we can find A:\n\n$$1 = A^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{2}L + \\frac{1}{8k}\\sin(2kL)\\right]$$\n\nSince $\\sin(2kL) = 0$ for the lowest energy state, the second term vanishes:\n\n$$1 = A^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{2}L\\right]$$\n\nSolving for A:\n\n$$A = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}$$\n\nSo, the normalized wave function is:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\cos(kx)$$"
