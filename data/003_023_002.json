    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors u and v using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu x v = ||u|| ||v|| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere ||u|| and ||v|| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both u and v.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n||u|| = √(3^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2) = √(9 + 4 + 1) = √14\n||v|| = √(1^2 + 1^2 + (-2)^2) = √(1 + 1 + 4) = √6\n\nNext, let's find the angle θ between the two vectors using the dot product formula:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)\n\n3(1) + (-2)(1) + 1(-2) = √14 √6 cos(θ)\n\n1 - 2 - 2 = √84 cos(θ)\n\n-3 = √84 cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = -3/√84\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(-3/√84)\n\nNow, let's find the unit vector n perpendicular to both u and v. We can do this by finding the cross product of u and v using the standard method (determinant of a matrix) and then normalizing the resulting vector:\n\nu x v = (i  j  k)\n        (3 -2  1)\n        (1  1 -2)\n\nu x v = i(-2 - 2) - j(6 + 1) + k(3 + 2)\nu x v = -4i - 7j + 5k\n\nNow, let's normalize this vector:\n\n||u x v|| = √((-4)^2 + (-7)^2 + 5^2) = √(16 + 49 + 25) = √90\n\nn = (-4/√90)i + (-7/√90)j + (5/√90)k\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product of u and v using trigonometry:\n\nu x v = ||u|| ||v|| sin(θ) n\nu x v = √14 √6 sin(arccos(-3/√84)) ((-4/√90)i + (-7/√90)j + (5/√90)k)\n\nu x v = (-4/√90)i + (-7/√90)j + (5/√90)k\n\nThe cross product of u and v using trigonometry is (-4/√90)i + (-7/√90)j + (5/√90)k."
