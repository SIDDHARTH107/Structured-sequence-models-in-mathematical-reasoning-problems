Each course has a certain credit value, and the student wants to maximize their total credit value. Using combinatorial optimization, what combination of four courses should the student take to maximize their total credit value? \n\nHere are the courses and their corresponding credit values: \n- Course A: 4 credits \n- Course B: 3 credits \n- Course C: 2 credits \n- Course D: 4 credits \n- Course E: 3 credits \n- Course F: 2 credits \n- Course G: 3 credits \n- Course H: 1 credit\n\nWhat combination of four courses should the student take to maximize their total credit value?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total credit value, the student should choose the four courses with the highest credit values. \n\nHere are the courses sorted by their credit values in descending order:\n- Course A: 4 credits\n- Course D: 4 credits\n- Course B: 3 credits\n- Course E: 3 credits\n- Course G: 3 credits\n- Course C: 2 credits\n- Course F: 2 credits\n- Course H: 1 credit\n\nThe student should choose the top four courses from this list:\n- Course A: 4 credits\n- Course D: 4 credits\n- Course B: 3 credits\n- Course E: 3 credits\n\nThis combination of courses will give the student a total credit value of 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 14 credits."
