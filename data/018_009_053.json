    "message_2": "First, let's find (A × B) × {6} and A × (B × {6}).\n\n(A × B) is the Cartesian product of sets A and B, which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, A × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × {6}. This is the Cartesian product of sets (A × B) and {6}, which consists of all ordered pairs ((a, b), 6) where (a, b) is in A × B. So, (A × B) × {6} = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}.\n\nNext, let's find B × {6}. This is the Cartesian product of sets B and {6}, which consists of all ordered pairs (b, 6) where b is in B. So, B × {6} = {(4, 6), (5, 6)}.\n\nNow, let's find A × (B × {6}). This is the Cartesian product of sets A and (B × {6}), which consists of all ordered pairs (a, (b, 6)) where a is in A and (b, 6) is in B × {6}. So, A × (B × {6}) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}.\n\nNow, we need to prove that (A × B) × {6} and A × (B × {6}) are equal. We can do this by showing that each element in (A × B) × {6} has a corresponding element in A × (B × {6}) and vice versa.\n\nNotice that for each element ((a, b), 6) in (A × B) × {6}, there is a corresponding element (a, (b, 6)) in A × (B × {6}). Specifically:\n\n- ((1, 4), 6) in (A × B) × {6} corresponds to (1, (4, 6)) in A × (B × {6})\n- ((1, 5), 6) in (A × B) × {6} corresponds to (1, (5, 6)) in A × (B × {6})\n- ((2, 4), 6) in (A × B) × {6} corresponds to (2, (4, 6)) in A × (B × {6})\n- ((2, 5), 6) in (A × B) × {6} corresponds to (2, (5, 6)) in A × (B × {6})\n- ((3, 4), 6) in (A × B) × {6} corresponds to (3, (4, 6)) in A × (B × {6})\n- ((3, 5), 6) in (A × B) × {6} corresponds to (3, (5, 6)) in A × (B × {6})\n\nSince each element in (A × B) × {6} has a corresponding element in A × (B × {6}) and vice versa, we can conclude that (A × B) × {6} and A × (B × {6}) are equal."
