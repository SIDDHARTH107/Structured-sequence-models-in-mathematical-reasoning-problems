    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is a measure of the sensitivity of a dynamical system to initial conditions. For the Rössler system, it is a set of three ordinary differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and then calculate the Lyapunov exponents. The Jacobian matrix for the Rössler system is:\n\nJ(x, y, z) = |  0   -1   -1  |\n             |  a    0    0  |\n             |  z    0   x-c |\n\nFor the given parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7, we can't directly find the maximum Lyapunov exponent analytically. Instead, we need to use numerical methods to compute the Lyapunov exponents, such as the Wolf algorithm or the Rosenstein algorithm.\n\nUsing numerical methods, the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Rössler system with parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7 is approximately 0.071. This value may vary slightly depending on the numerical method used and the specific initial conditions chosen for the computation."
