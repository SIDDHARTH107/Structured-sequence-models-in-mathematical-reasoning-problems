    "message_1": "A company is hiring for a management position and receives applications from two candidates, Alice and Bob. The company cannot determine the true qualifications of each candidate, but Alice knows that she is better qualified than Bob with probability 0.8, and Bob knows that he is better qualified than Alice with probability 0.7. \n\nAssuming that Alice and Bob are rational, what is the probability that Alice will signal her higher level of qualification to the company?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that Alice is better qualified than Bob, and B be the event that Bob is better qualified than Alice. We are given P(A) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.7. However, these probabilities are not complementary, as they are the probabilities known by Alice and Bob, respectively. To find the true probability of A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nP(A) + P(B) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∪ B)\n\nSince A and B are mutually exclusive events (either Alice is better qualified or Bob is better qualified), their intersection is an empty set, and P(A ∩ B) = 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nP(A) + P(B) = P(A ∪ B)\n\n0.8 + 0.7 = P(A ∪ B)\n\n1.5 = P(A ∪ B)\n\nSince the probability of a union of events cannot be greater than 1, there must be some mistake in the problem statement or some missing information. However, assuming that the given probabilities are correct, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\nIf Alice signals her higher level of qualification, she will only do so if she believes she has a better chance of getting the job. Since Alice knows that she is better qualified than Bob with probability 0.8, she will signal her higher level of qualification with a probability of 0.8."
