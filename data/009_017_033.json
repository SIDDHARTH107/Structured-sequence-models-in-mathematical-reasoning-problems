    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 cm from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) passing through the loop.\n\nMathematically, Ampere's Law is given by:\n\n∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀ I\n\nHere, B is the magnetic field, dl is the infinitesimal length along the closed loop, and I is the current passing through the loop.\n\nFor a long straight wire carrying a current I, the magnetic field B is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop of radius r (2 cm in this case) centered on the wire as our Amperian loop. Since the magnetic field is tangent to the loop at every point, the dot product B ⋅ dl reduces to B dl.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's Law as:\n\n∮ B dl = B ∮ dl = B (2πr) = μ₀ I\n\nWe need to solve for B. First, let's convert the given distance from cm to meters:\n\nr = 2 cm = 0.02 m\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant and is given by:\n\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) T m/A\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB (2πr) = μ₀ I\nB = (μ₀ I) / (2πr)\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T m/A × 6 A) / (2π × 0.02 m)\n\nThe A (amps) in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T m × 6) / (2π × 0.02 m)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-7) T × 6) / 0.02\nB = 6 × 10^(-7) T / 0.02\n\nFinally, calculate the magnetic field strength:\n\nB ≈ 3 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 cm from the wire is approximately 3 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
