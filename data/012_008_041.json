    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is planar, we can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 6 vertices with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nLet's first check if the graph satisfies Euler's formula for planar graphs, which is:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, v = 10 and e = 15. We need to find the maximum number of faces (f) that can be formed in a planar graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges.\n\nAccording to the inequality for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds true, so it is possible that the graph is planar. However, this is not a guarantee, so we still need to check for the presence of a K5 or K3,3 subgraph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the degrees of the vertices. In a K5 graph, each vertex has a degree of 4, and in a K3,3 graph, each vertex has a degree of 3. Since our graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 15 = 30. It is possible to have a graph where each vertex has a degree of 3 (which would be the case for a K3,3 subgraph), but it is not possible to have a graph where each vertex has a degree of 4 (which would be the case for a K5 subgraph) because the sum of the degrees would be 40, which is greater than 30.\n\nTherefore, we only need to check for the presence of a K3,3 subgraph. However, a K3,3 graph has 9 edges, and since our graph has 15 edges, it is possible that it contains a K3,3 subgraph. But, we cannot determine this without more information about the specific graph.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot definitively determine if the graph is planar or not without more information about the specific graph. If it is planar, it would be possible to draw it on a plane without any edge intersecting another edge, but if it contains a K3,3 subgraph, it would not be planar."
