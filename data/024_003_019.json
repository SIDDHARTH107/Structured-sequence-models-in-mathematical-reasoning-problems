    "message_2": "To compute the Gaussian curvature of the surface, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nThe surface is given by the equation z = x^2 - 2xy + y^2. Let's parametrize the surface by the coordinates (x, y) as follows:\n\nr(x, y) = (x, y, x^2 - 2xy + y^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_x = (∂r/∂x) = (1, 0, 2x - 2y)\nr_y = (∂r/∂y) = (0, 1, -2x + 2y)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_xx = (∂²r/∂x²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_yy = (∂²r/∂y²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_xy = (∂²r/∂x∂y) = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_x • r_x = (1, 0, 2x - 2y) • (1, 0, 2x - 2y) = 1 + (2x - 2y)^2\nF = r_x • r_y = (1, 0, 2x - 2y) • (0, 1, -2x + 2y) = -2x + 2y\nG = r_y • r_y = (0, 1, -2x + 2y) • (0, 1, -2x + 2y) = 1 + (-2x + 2y)^2\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_xx • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\nM = r_xy • N = (0, 0, -2) • (0, 0, 1) = -2\nN = r_yy • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\n\nNow, we compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1), we have:\n\nE = 1 + (2 - 2)^2 = 1\nF = -2 + 2 = 0\nG = 1 + (-2 + 2)^2 = 1\n\nL = 2\nM = -2\nN = 2\n\nK = (2 * 2 - (-2)^2) / (1 * 1 - 0^2) = (4 - 4) / 1 = 0\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the given surface at the point (1, 1) is 0."
