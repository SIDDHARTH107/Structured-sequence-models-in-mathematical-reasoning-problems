    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. Here, we will use it to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solutions in the harmony memory (e.g., 10)\n- Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.8)\n- Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting the pitch of a selected value (e.g., 0.3)\n- Number of iterations (NI): The number of times the algorithm will be executed (e.g., 1000)\n- Lower and upper bounds for x (e.g., -10 and 10)\n\nStep 2: Create the initial harmony memory\nGenerate HMS random solutions within the bounds and store them in the harmony memory.\n\nStep 3: Improvise a new harmony\nFor each variable (in this case, x), generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than HMCR, select a value from the harmony memory for that variable. If the random number is greater than or equal to HMCR, generate a new random value within the bounds for that variable.\n\nStep 4: Apply pitch adjustment\nFor each variable in the new harmony, generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than PAR, adjust the pitch of the selected value by adding or subtracting a small random value.\n\nStep 5: Update the harmony memory\nCalculate the objective function value (f(x)) for the new harmony. If the new harmony is better than the worst harmony in the memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\nStep 6: Check the stopping criterion\nIf the number of iterations reaches NI, stop the algorithm. Otherwise, go back to Step 3.\n\nStep 7: Find the best solution\nSelect the harmony with the lowest objective function value (f(x)) from the harmony memory.\n\nAfter executing the Harmony Search algorithm with the given function and parameters, we will obtain the best solution (x value) that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6. Note that the algorithm is stochastic, so the result may not be the exact minimum but should be close to it. The exact minimum can be found using calculus, where the derivative of the function is set to zero and solved for x. In this case, the minimum value occurs at x = -2.5, and the minimum value of the function is f(-2.5) = 1.25."
