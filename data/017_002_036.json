    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we first need to find all the divisors of the order of G, which is 10. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. For each divisor, we will find the corresponding subgroups.\n\n1. Subgroups of order 1:\nThere is only one subgroup of order 1, which is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\n2. Subgroups of order 2:\nSince G is a cyclic group, we can find the subgroups of order 2 by finding the elements of G with order 2. The order of an element g^n is given by the formula |G| / gcd(n, |G|), where gcd(n, |G|) is the greatest common divisor of n and |G|. In this case, we want to find the elements with order 2, so we need to find the n values such that gcd(n, 10) = 5. The only such value is n = 5, so the element g^5 has order 2. Therefore, the subgroup of order 2 is {e, g^5}.\n\n3. Subgroups of order 5:\nTo find the subgroups of order 5, we need to find the elements of G with order 5. We want to find the n values such that gcd(n, 10) = 2. The possible values are n = 2 and n = 4. So, the elements g^2 and g^4 have order 5. The subgroup generated by g^2 is {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8}, and the subgroup generated by g^4 is {e, g^4, g^8, g^12, g^16} = {e, g^4, g^8, g^2, g^6} (since g^10 = e). Both subgroups are the same, so there is only one subgroup of order 5, which is {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8}.\n\n4. Subgroups of order 10:\nThere is only one subgroup of order 10, which is the entire group G itself, generated by g: {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7, g^8, g^9}.\n\nNow, we need to prove that every subgroup of G is cyclic. We have found all the subgroups of G, and each of them is generated by a single element:\n\n- The trivial subgroup {e} is generated by e.\n- The subgroup {e, g^5} is generated by g^5.\n- The subgroup {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8} is generated by g^2 (or g^4, since they generate the same subgroup).\n- The entire group G is generated by g.\n\nSince each subgroup is generated by a single element, every subgroup of G is cyclic."
