    "message_2": "To calculate the Euler characteristic of a closed surface homeomorphic to a sphere with three handles, we can use the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic (χ) = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, for surfaces with handles, we can use the genus (g) of the surface to determine the Euler characteristic. The genus is the number of handles on the surface. In this case, the surface has three handles, so the genus is 3.\n\nThe formula for the Euler characteristic of a surface with genus g is:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a surface with three handles (genus 3), the Euler characteristic is:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the closed surface homeomorphic to a sphere with three handles is -4."
