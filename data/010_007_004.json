    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to the Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces in Topology:\n\nConsider a torus (doughnut-shaped object) with a circumference of 10 units and a radius of 2 units. Suppose we puncture one point on the torus. Find the fundamental group of the resulting space, and determine if there exist any non-trivial covering spaces.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of the punctured torus, we first need to understand the fundamental group of the torus itself. The torus can be represented as a square with opposite sides identified. Let's denote the horizontal identification by 'a' and the vertical identification by 'b'. Then, the fundamental group of the torus is given by the free product of two copies of the integers, i.e.,\n\nπ1(Torus) = Z * Z = <a, b | ab = ba>\n\nNow, let's puncture the torus at a point. This is equivalent to removing a point from the square and then identifying the sides as before. The fundamental group of the punctured torus can be computed using the Van Kampen theorem, which states that the fundamental group of a space obtained by gluing two spaces along a common subspace is the free product of their fundamental groups, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the images of the common subspace's fundamental group.\n\nIn our case, we can think of the punctured torus as the union of two open sets: one containing the puncture and the other not containing it. The intersection of these two sets is homotopy equivalent to a circle. The fundamental group of the first set (containing the puncture) is the same as the fundamental group of the torus, i.e., Z * Z. The second set (not containing the puncture) is homotopy equivalent to a punctured plane, which has a trivial fundamental group. The intersection of the two sets has a fundamental group isomorphic to Z.\n\nApplying the Van Kampen theorem, we get:\n\nπ1(Punctured Torus) = (Z * Z) * (1) / <1> = Z * Z\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the punctured torus is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the torus itself, i.e., Z * Z.\n\nNow, let's consider the existence of non-trivial covering spaces. A covering space is a space that maps onto the punctured torus in a locally trivial manner. Since the fundamental group of the punctured torus is Z * Z, there exist infinitely many non-trivial covering spaces corresponding to different subgroups of Z * Z. For example, the universal cover of the punctured torus is the punctured plane, which has a fundamental group isomorphic to the free group on two generators, F2. Other non-trivial covering spaces can be obtained by considering other subgroups of Z * Z, such as Z * 2Z, 2Z * Z, and so on."
