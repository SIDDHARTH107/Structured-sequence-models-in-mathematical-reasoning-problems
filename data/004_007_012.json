If the fuel is being pumped out of the tank at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute, find the rate at which the depth of the fuel in the tank is decreasing using the chain rule.",
    "message_2": "Let V be the volume of the liquid fuel in the tank, h be the depth of the fuel, and r be the radius of the tank. We are given that r = 5 feet and dh/dt = -2 cubic feet per minute (since the fuel is being pumped out).\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nSince the radius of the tank is constant (5 feet), we can write the volume of the liquid fuel as:\n\nV = π(5^2)h = 25πh\n\nNow, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t):\n\ndV/dt = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = -2 cubic feet per minute, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n-2 = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we will solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = -2 / (25π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ -0.02546 feet per minute\n\nSo, the depth of the fuel in the tank is decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.02546 feet per minute."
