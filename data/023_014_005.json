    "message_2": "To find the constant A, we need to first find the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx and then set it equal to 1. \n\n|ψ(x)|^2 = (A(exp(-ax^2) + exp(-bx^2)))^2\n= A^2(exp(-2ax^2) + 2exp(-(a+b)x^2) + exp(-2bx^2))\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression over all x:\n\n∫|ψ(x)|^2 dx = ∫(A^2(exp(-2ax^2) + 2exp(-(a+b)x^2) + exp(-2bx^2))) dx\n\nThis integral can be split into three separate integrals:\n\n∫|ψ(x)|^2 dx = A^2(∫exp(-2ax^2) dx + 2∫exp(-(a+b)x^2) dx + ∫exp(-2bx^2) dx)\n\nNow, we can use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫exp(-cx^2) dx = √(π/c)\n\nApplying this formula to each of the three integrals:\n\n∫|ψ(x)|^2 dx = A^2(√(π/(2a)) + 2√(π/(a+b)) + √(π/(2b)))\n\nNow, we set this integral equal to 1 to satisfy the normalization condition:\n\n1 = A^2(√(π/(2a)) + 2√(π/(a+b)) + √(π/(2b)))\n\nTo find A, we can take the square root of both sides:\n\nA = √(1/((√(π/(2a)) + 2√(π/(a+b)) + √(π/(2b)))))\n\nThis is the constant A that satisfies the normalization condition."
