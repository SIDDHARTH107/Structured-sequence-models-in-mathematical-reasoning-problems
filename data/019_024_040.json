    "message_1": "A car travels with a speed of 60 km/h from point A to point B. The distance between point A and point B is 180 km. Using abductive logic, estimate the time taken by the car to travel from point A to point B.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the time taken by the car to travel from point A to point B, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 180 km and the speed is 60 km/h. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nTime = 180 km / 60 km/h = 3 hours\n\nSo, the car will take approximately 3 hours to travel from point A to point B."
