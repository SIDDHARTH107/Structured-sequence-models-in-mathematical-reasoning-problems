    "message_2": "To determine if G1 and G2 are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency of vertices is preserved.\n\nLet's label the vertices of G1 as A, B, C, and D, and the vertices of G2 as W, X, Y, and Z. The given connections are:\n\nG1: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A\nG2: W-Z, X-Y, Y-W, Z-X\n\nNow, let's try to find a correspondence between the vertices of G1 and G2 that preserves adjacency:\n\n1. Map A to W: Since A is connected to B and D in G1, we need to find a vertex in G2 that is connected to two other vertices. W is connected to Y and Z, so we can map A to W.\n\n2. Map B to Y: Since B is connected to A and C in G1, and we have already mapped A to W, we need to find a vertex in G2 that is connected to W and another vertex. Y is connected to W and X, so we can map B to Y.\n\n3. Map C to Z: Since C is connected to B and D in G1, and we have already mapped B to Y, we need to find a vertex in G2 that is connected to Y and another vertex. Z is connected to Y and X, so we can map C to Z.\n\n4. Map D to X: Since D is connected to A and C in G1, and we have already mapped A to W and C to Z, we need to find a vertex in G2 that is connected to W and Z. X is connected to W and Z, so we can map D to X.\n\nNow let's check if the adjacency is preserved:\n\nG1: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A\nG2: W-Y, Y-Z, Z-X, X-W\n\nMapping:\nA -> W\nB -> Y\nC -> Z\nD -> X\n\nMapped G1: W-Y, Y-Z, Z-X, X-W\n\nThe adjacency is preserved, and therefore, G1 and G2 are isomorphic."
