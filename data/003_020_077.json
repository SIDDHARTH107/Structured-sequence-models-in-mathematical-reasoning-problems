    "message_1": "A student is standing 50 meters away from the base of a building. He measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building and finds it to be 45 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the building (50 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45) = height / 50\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 50\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 50 * 1\n\nheight = 50 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is 50 meters."
