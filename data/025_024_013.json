    "message_2": "To find the geometric invariant theory (GIT) quotient of the action of G on the parabola, we first need to find the invariant polynomials under the action of G. Let's denote the action of G on a point (x, y) as g(x, y) = (-x, y).\n\nInvariant polynomials are those that remain unchanged under the action of G. In this case, we are looking for polynomials P(x, y) such that P(g(x, y)) = P(x, y) for all (x, y) in the parabola y = x^2.\n\nLet's consider the polynomial P(x, y) = x^2. Under the action of G, we have:\n\nP(g(x, y)) = P(-x, y) = (-x)^2 = x^2 = P(x, y).\n\nSince P(x, y) = x^2 is invariant under the action of G, we can use it to form the GIT quotient. The GIT quotient is the set of equivalence classes of points in the parabola, where two points are considered equivalent if they are related by the action of G. In this case, the equivalence classes are {(x, x^2), (-x, x^2)} for each x in the real numbers.\n\nThe GIT quotient can be represented as the set of invariant polynomials, which in this case is the set {x^2}. Therefore, the GIT quotient of the action of G on the parabola is the set {x^2}."
