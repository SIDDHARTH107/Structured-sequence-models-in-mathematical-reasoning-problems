    "message_2": "To choose 5 different books from a shelf containing 20 books, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of books (20 in this case) and k is the number of books we want to choose (5 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes the factorial of a number, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!(20-5)!)\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!15!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n20! = 20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16 × 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nC(20, 5) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(20, 5) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × 16) / 120\n\nC(20, 5) = 15504\n\nSo, there are 15,504 ways to choose 5 different books from a shelf containing 20 books."
