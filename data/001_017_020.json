    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we will first combine the logarithms using the properties of logarithms.\n\nlog(x-3) + log(x+2) - log(x-1) = 2\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the first two logarithms:\n\nlog((x-3)(x+2)) - log(x-1) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the quotient rule for logarithms to combine the remaining logarithms:\n\nlog(((x-3)(x+2))/(x-1)) = 2\n\nTo remove the logarithm, we can use the property of logarithms that states that if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. In this case, our base is 10:\n\n10^2 = ((x-3)(x+2))/(x-1)\n\n100 = ((x-3)(x+2))/(x-1)\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by (x-1) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n100(x-1) = (x-3)(x+2)\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\n100x - 100 = x^2 - x - 6\n\nRearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 101x + 94 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. In this case, we can factor the equation:\n\n(x - 94)(x - 7) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = 94 or x = 7\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. If any of the logarithms have a negative or zero argument, the solution is not valid.\n\nFor x = 94:\n\nlog(94-3) + log(94+2) - log(94-1) = log(91) + log(96) - log(93)\n\nAll the arguments are positive, so x = 94 is a valid solution.\n\nFor x = 7:\n\nlog(7-3) + log(7+2) - log(7-1) = log(4) + log(9) - log(6)\n\nAll the arguments are positive, so x = 7 is also a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for the equation are x = 94 and x = 7."
