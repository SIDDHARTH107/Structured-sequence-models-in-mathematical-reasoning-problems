They conduct a study and gather the following data:\n\n- Amount spent on advertising ($x$): 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15\n- Sales generated ($y$): 80, 90, 100, 110, 115, 120\n\nUsing linear regression analysis where $y$ is the dependent variable and $x$ is the independent variable, determine the regression equation and predict the sales generated when the company spends $11,000 on advertising.",
    "message_2": "To determine the regression equation, we first need to calculate the mean of $x$ and $y$, the slope ($b_1$), and the $y$-intercept ($b_0$).\n\nMean of $x$:\n$(5 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 15) / 6 = 64 / 6 = 10.67$\n\nMean of $y$:\n$(80 + 90 + 100 + 110 + 115 + 120) / 6 = 615 / 6 = 102.5$\n\nNow, we need to calculate the slope ($b_1$) using the formula:\n\n$b_1 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n$(5 - 10.67)(80 - 102.5) + (8 - 10.67)(90 - 102.5) + (10 - 10.67)(100 - 102.5) + (12 - 10.67)(110 - 102.5) + (14 - 10.67)(115 - 102.5) + (15 - 10.67)(120 - 102.5) = -98.01$\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n$(5 - 10.67)^2 + (8 - 10.67)^2 + (10 - 10.67)^2 + (12 - 10.67)^2 + (14 - 10.67)^2 + (15 - 10.67)^2 = 61.34$\n\nNow, we can find the slope:\n$b_1 = \\frac{-98.01}{61.34} = -1.598$\n\nNext, we need to calculate the $y$-intercept ($b_0$) using the formula:\n\n$b_0 = \\bar{y} - b_1 \\bar{x}$\n\n$b_0 = 102.5 - (-1.598)(10.67) = 102.5 + 17.06 = 119.56$\n\nNow, we have the regression equation:\n\n$y = -1.598x + 119.56$\n\nTo predict the sales generated when the company spends $11,000 on advertising, we need to plug in the value of $x = 11$:\n\n$y = -1.598(11) + 119.56 = -17.578 + 119.56 = 101.982$\n\nSo, the predicted sales generated when the company spends $11,000 on advertising is approximately $101,982."
