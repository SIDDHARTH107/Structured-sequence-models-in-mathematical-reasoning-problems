    "message_2": "Let's represent each person as a node, and a handshake between two people as an edge connecting the nodes. Since each person shakes hands with exactly 3 other people, each node will have a degree of 3.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of handshakes that must have happened between people who know each other. This means we want to minimize the number of edges connecting nodes that represent people who know each other.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of handshakes. Since there are 6 people and each person shakes hands with 3 others, there are a total of (6 * 3) / 2 = 9 handshakes. This is because each handshake is counted twice (once for each person involved).\n\nNow, let's try to minimize the number of handshakes between people who know each other. We can arrange the 6 people in a cycle, where each person shakes hands with the person to their left, the person to their right, and the person directly across from them. In this arrangement, no two people who know each other will shake hands.\n\nHere's an illustration of this arrangement:\n\n```\n1 -- 4\n| \\/ |\n| /\\ |\n2 -- 3\n```\n\nIn this arrangement, person 1 shakes hands with persons 2, 3, and 4; person 2 shakes hands with persons 1, 3, and 6; person 3 shakes hands with persons 1, 2, and 5; person 4 shakes hands with persons 1, 5, and 6; person 5 shakes hands with persons 3, 4, and 6; and person 6 shakes hands with persons 2, 4, and 5.\n\nAs we can see, there are no handshakes between people who know each other in this arrangement. Therefore, the minimum number of handshakes that must have happened between people who know each other is 0."
