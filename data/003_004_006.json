    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) = 1/2 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 360, we need to find the angles x in degrees that satisfy this equation within the given range.\n\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\nThe angles that satisfy this equation are x = 30° and x = 150°.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The sine function has a positive value in the first and second quadrants of the unit circle (0° ≤ x ≤ 180°).\n2. In the first quadrant, the angle x = 30° has a sine value of 1/2 (sin(30°) = 1/2).\n3. In the second quadrant, the angle x = 150° also has a sine value of 1/2 (sin(150°) = 1/2).\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation sin(x) = 1/2 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 360 are x = 30° and x = 150°."
