    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = |A| * cos(theta) * (B/|B|)\n\nwhere |A| is the magnitude of vector A, |B| is the magnitude of vector B, and theta is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle between vector A and vector B. Since we know the angles both vectors make with the horizontal, we can find the angle between them by taking the difference:\n\ntheta = 60 degrees - 40 degrees = 20 degrees\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = |A| * cos(theta) * (B/|B|)\n= 10 * cos(20 degrees) * (5/5)\n= 10 * cos(20 degrees)\n\nNow, we need to find the cosine of 20 degrees. Using a calculator or a trigonometric table, we find that:\n\ncos(20 degrees) ≈ 0.9397\n\nSo, the projection of A onto B is:\n\nProjection of A onto B ≈ 10 * 0.9397\n≈ 9.397 meters"
