Show that there exists a compact oriented 4-dimensional manifold N such that ∂N = M and there exists a map F: N → S^1 with F|∂N = f. \n\nSolve this problem by demonstrating the construction of such a manifold N and a corresponding map F.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will construct the 4-dimensional manifold N and the map F as follows:\n\n1. First, consider the product manifold M × [0, 1], which is a compact oriented 4-dimensional manifold with boundary. The boundary of M × [0, 1] consists of two copies of M, one at the \"bottom\" (M × {0}) and one at the \"top\" (M × {1}).\n\n2. Next, we will construct a map F': M × [0, 1] → S^1 × [0, 1] such that F'|∂(M × [0, 1]) = (f, id). To do this, define F'(x, t) = (f(x), t) for all (x, t) ∈ M × [0, 1]. This map is continuous and restricts to the given map f on the boundary of M × [0, 1].\n\n3. Now, we will modify the target space S^1 × [0, 1] to \"glue\" the top and bottom boundaries of M × [0, 1] together. To do this, consider the quotient space (S^1 × [0, 1]) / ∼, where the equivalence relation ∼ is defined by (x, 0) ∼ (x, 1) for all x ∈ S^1. This quotient space is homeomorphic to S^1 × S^1, which is a compact oriented 4-dimensional manifold.\n\n4. Let q: S^1 × [0, 1] → (S^1 × [0, 1]) / ∼ be the quotient map. Then, we can define a map F: M × [0, 1] → S^1 × S^1 by F = q ∘ F'. This map is continuous and restricts to the given map f on the boundary of M × [0, 1].\n\n5. Finally, let N = M × [0, 1] / ∼', where the equivalence relation ∼' is defined by (x, 0) ∼' (x, 1) for all x ∈ M. Then, N is a compact oriented 4-dimensional manifold with boundary ∂N = M, and the map F descends to a continuous map F: N → S^1 × S^1 with F|∂N = f.\n\nThus, we have constructed a compact oriented 4-dimensional manifold N with boundary ∂N = M and a continuous map F: N → S^1 × S^1 with F|∂N = f, as desired."
