    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob using a digital signature. If Alice's private key is (5,11) and she chooses a prime number p=13, what would be the corresponding public key of Alice?",
    "message_2": "To find Alice's public key, we need to use the private key (d, n) = (5, 11) and the prime number p = 13. In this case, n is the product of two prime numbers, p and q. Since we know p and n, we can find q:\n\nn = p * q\n11 = 13 * q\nq = 11/13\n\nSince q must be a prime number and 11/13 is not an integer, there seems to be an error in the given information. Please check the values of the private key and prime number."
