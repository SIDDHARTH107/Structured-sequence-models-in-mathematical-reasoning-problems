    "message_1": "A math student needs to determine the shortest path between two given points on a surface described by the following equation:\n\nz = x^2 + 2y^2\n\nThe two given points are P(1,0,1) and Q(4,1,17). The student is required to determine the geodesic path between P and Q on the given surface.",
    "message_2": "To find the geodesic path between two points on a surface, we can use the calculus of variations. The goal is to minimize the arc length integral between the two points on the surface. The arc length integral is given by:\n\nL = ∫(√(1 + (dz/dx)^2 + (dz/dy)^2)) ds\n\nwhere ds is the differential arc length along the surface, and (dz/dx) and (dz/dy) are the partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of z:\n\ndz/dx = 2x\ndz/dy = 4y\n\nNow, we can substitute these into the arc length integral:\n\nL = ∫(√(1 + (2x)^2 + (4y)^2)) ds\n\nTo minimize this integral, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation. However, solving the Euler-Lagrange equation for this problem is quite complex and requires advanced mathematical techniques. Instead, we can use a numerical method to approximate the geodesic path.\n\nOne such numerical method is the gradient descent method. We start at point P and iteratively move in the direction of the negative gradient of the arc length integral until we reach point Q. The gradient descent method can be implemented using a computer program or software like Mathematica or MATLAB.\n\nIn summary, finding the geodesic path between P and Q on the given surface requires minimizing the arc length integral using advanced mathematical techniques or numerical methods. The gradient descent method is one such numerical method that can be used to approximate the geodesic path."
