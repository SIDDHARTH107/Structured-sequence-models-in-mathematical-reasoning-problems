    "message_2": "To maximize the volume of the box, we need to find the dimensions of the box that will give us the maximum volume. Let x be the length of the side of the square that is cut out from each corner. When the sides are folded up, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 30 - 2x\nWidth: 20 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume of the box, V, can be expressed as:\n\nV = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)x\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\n\nV = 4x^3 - 100x^2 + 600x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the function by taking the derivative of V with respect to x and setting it to 0:\n\ndV/dx = 12x^2 - 200x + 600\n\nSetting dV/dx to 0 and solving for x:\n\n12x^2 - 200x + 600 = 0\n\nDividing the equation by 4, we get:\n\n3x^2 - 50x + 150 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -50, and c = 150:\n\nx = (50 ± √((-50)^2 - 4(3)(150))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (50 ± √(2500 - 1800)) / 6\n\nx = (50 ± √700) / 6\n\nThe two possible values for x are:\n\nx = (50 + √700) / 6 ≈ 8.29 cm\nx = (50 - √700) / 6 ≈ 6.04 cm\n\nSince the width of the metal sheet is 20 cm, we cannot cut out squares with sides larger than 10 cm. Therefore, the valid solution is x ≈ 6.04 cm.\n\nSo, the length of the side of the square that must be cut out in order to maximize the volume of the box is approximately 6.04 cm."
