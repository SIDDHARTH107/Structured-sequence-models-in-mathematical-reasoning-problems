    "message_2": "The symplectic area of an ellipse can be found using the formula for the area of an ellipse, which is given by:\n\nArea = π * a * b\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. In this case, a = 5 and b = 3.\n\nArea = π * 5 * 3\nArea = 15π\n\nSo, the symplectic area of the ellipse is 15π square units."
