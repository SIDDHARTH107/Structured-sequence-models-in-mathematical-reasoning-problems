    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to sell their product. The agent puts forth an effort that the principal cannot directly observe, but the effort affects the probability of a successful sale. The sale can generate a revenue of $100 for the principal and the agent's effort cost $40. The agent's effort will determine the probability of a sale according to the function f(x) = 0.4 + 0.3x, where x is the effort on a scale of 0 to 10. The principal and the agent both have utility functions in terms of profit, where the principal's is U1(C) = ln(C) and the agent's is U2(C) = -0.01C^2 + C - 10. \n\nAssuming that the agent is risk-neutral and the principal is risk-averse, what is the optimal effort level for the agent to put forth, and what is the expected profit for both the principal and the agent at this level of effort?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal effort level for the agent, we need to maximize the expected utility for both the principal and the agent. First, let's find the expected profit for both parties.\n\nExpected profit for the principal (EPP) = Revenue from sale * Probability of sale - Payment to agent\nExpected profit for the agent (EPA) = Payment from principal - Cost of effort\n\nThe probability of a sale is given by the function f(x) = 0.4 + 0.3x. The revenue from a sale is $100, and the cost of effort for the agent is $40.\n\nLet P be the payment from the principal to the agent. Then,\n\nEPP = (100 * (0.4 + 0.3x)) - P\nEPA = P - 40x\n\nNow, we need to find the utility functions for both parties.\n\nU1(C) = ln(C) for the principal\nU2(C) = -0.01C^2 + C - 10 for the agent\n\nSubstitute the expected profits into the utility functions:\n\nU1(EPP) = ln((100 * (0.4 + 0.3x)) - P)\nU2(EPA) = -0.01(P - 40x)^2 + (P - 40x) - 10\n\nSince the agent is risk-neutral, we can maximize their expected utility by maximizing their expected profit. To do this, we can take the derivative of EPA with respect to x and set it equal to 0.\n\ndEPA/dx = -40\n\nThis tells us that the optimal effort level for the agent is independent of the payment from the principal. Now, we can find the optimal effort level by maximizing the probability of a sale, f(x).\n\nf(x) = 0.4 + 0.3x\n\nTo maximize f(x), we can set x = 10 (the maximum value on the scale). Then,\n\nf(10) = 0.4 + 0.3(10) = 0.4 + 3 = 3.4\n\nHowever, since the probability cannot be greater than 1, the maximum probability of a sale is 1. So, the optimal effort level for the agent is x = (1 - 0.4) / 0.3 = 2.\n\nNow, we can find the expected profit for both parties at this level of effort:\n\nEPP = (100 * (0.4 + 0.3(2))) - P = 100 - P\nEPA = P - 40(2) = P - 80\n\nTo find the optimal payment P, we can equate the marginal utilities of both parties:\n\ndU1(EPP)/dP = dU2(EPA)/dP\n\n1 / (100 - P) = -0.02(P - 80)\n\nSolving for P, we get:\n\nP = 50\n\nNow, we can find the expected profit for both parties at the optimal effort level and payment:\n\nEPP = 100 - 50 = 50\nEPA = 50 - 80 = -30\n\nHowever, since the agent's expected profit cannot be negative (they would not agree to such a contract), the principal must pay the agent at least the cost of their effort, which is $40 * 2 = $80.\n\nIn this case, the expected profit for both parties would be:\n\nEPP = 100 - 80 = 20\nEPA = 80 - 80 = 0\n\nSo, the optimal effort level for the agent is 2, and the expected profit for the principal and the agent at this level of effort is $20 and $0, respectively."
