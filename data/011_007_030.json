    "message_1": "In a school, there are 10 students who want to form a committee. The committee can have either 3 members or 4 members. How many ways can the committee be formed if each student can serve on the committee only once? Use recurrence relations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using recurrence relations, let's denote the number of ways to form a committee of size k from n students as C(n, k). We are given that there are 10 students and the committee can have either 3 members or 4 members. So, we need to find C(10, 3) and C(10, 4).\n\nNow, let's set up the recurrence relation. If we consider a specific student, there are two possibilities: either the student is part of the committee or not.\n\n1. If the student is part of the committee, then we need to select (k-1) members from the remaining (n-1) students. This can be done in C(n-1, k-1) ways.\n\n2. If the student is not part of the committee, then we need to select k members from the remaining (n-1) students. This can be done in C(n-1, k) ways.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation can be written as:\n\nC(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)\n\nWe also need the base cases for the recurrence relation:\n\nC(n, 0) = 1 for all n (there is only one way to form an empty committee)\nC(n, n) = 1 for all n (there is only one way to form a committee with all n members)\n\nNow, we can use the recurrence relation and base cases to find C(10, 3) and C(10, 4).\n\nC(10, 3) = C(9, 2) + C(9, 3)\nC(9, 2) = C(8, 1) + C(8, 2)\nC(9, 3) = C(8, 2) + C(8, 3)\n\nC(8, 1) = 8 (8 ways to choose 1 member from 8 students)\nC(8, 2) = C(7, 1) + C(7, 2)\nC(8, 3) = C(7, 2) + C(7, 3)\n\nC(7, 1) = 7\nC(7, 2) = C(6, 1) + C(6, 2)\nC(7, 3) = C(6, 2) + C(6, 3)\n\nC(6, 1) = 6\nC(6, 2) = C(5, 1) + C(5, 2)\nC(6, 3) = C(5, 2) + C(5, 3)\n\nC(5, 1) = 5\nC(5, 2) = C(4, 1) + C(4, 2)\nC(5, 3) = C(4, 2) + C(4, 3)\n\nC(4, 1) = 4\nC(4, 2) = C(3, 1) + C(3, 2)\nC(4, 3) = C(3, 2) + C(3, 3)\n\nC(3, 1) = 3\nC(3, 2) = C(2, 1) + C(2, 2)\nC(3, 3) = 1\n\nC(2, 1) = 2\nC(2, 2) = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the values back into the recurrence relation:\n\nC(5, 2) = C(4, 1) + C(4, 2) = 4 + 6 = 10\nC(5, 3) = C(4, 2) + C(4, 3) = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nC(6, 2) = C(5, 1) + C(5, 2) = 5 + 10 = 15\nC(6, 3) = C(5, 2) + C(5, 3) = 10 + 7 = 17\n\nC(7, 2) = C(6, 1) + C(6, 2) = 6 + 15 = 21\nC(7, 3) = C(6, 2) + C(6, 3) = 15 + 17 = 32\n\nC(8, 2) = C(7, 1) + C(7, 2) = 7 + 21 = 28\nC(8, 3) = C(7, 2) + C(7, 3) = 21 + 32 = 53\n\nC(9, 2) = C(8, 1) + C(8, 2) = 8 + 28 = 36\nC(9, 3) = C(8, 2) + C(8, 3) = 28 + 53 = 81\n\nC(10, 3) = C(9, 2) + C(9, 3) = 36 + 81 = 117\n\nNow, we need to find C(10, 4):\n\nC(10, 4) = C(9, 3) + C(9, 4)\nC(9, 4) = C(8, 3) + C(8, 4)\n\nC(8, 4) = C(7, 3) + C(7, 4)\nC(7, 4) = C(6, 3) + C(6, 4)\n\nC(6, 4) = C(5, 3) + C(5, 4)\nC(5, 4) = C(4, 3) + C(4, 4)\n\nC(4, 4) = 1\n\nSubstituting the values back into the recurrence relation:\n\nC(5, 4) = C(4, 3) + C(4, 4) = 1 + 1 = 2\nC(6, 4) = C(5, 3) + C(5, 4) = 7 + 2 = 9\nC(7, 4) = C(6, 3) + C(6, 4) = 17 + 9 = 26\nC(8, 4) = C(7, 3) + C(7, 4) = 32 + 26 = 58\nC(9, 4) = C(8, 3) + C(8, 4) = 53 + 58 = 111\n\nC(10, 4) = C(9, 3) + C(9, 4) = 81 + 111 = 192\n\nFinally, since the committee can have either 3 members or 4 members, we need to find the total number of ways to form the committee:\n\nTotal ways = C(10, 3) + C(10, 4) = 117 + 192 = 309\n\nSo, there are 309 ways to form the committee with either 3 or 4 members from 10 students."
