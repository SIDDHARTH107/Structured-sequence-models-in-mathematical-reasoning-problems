    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 2z)/(z^2 - 1), we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two singularities: z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to classify these singularities as removable, pole of order k, or essential. To do this, we can analyze the behavior of the function near these points.\n\n1. Singularity at z = 1:\n\nWe can factor the numerator as follows:\n\nz^2 + 2z = z(z + 2)\n\nSo, the function can be rewritten as:\n\nf(z) = z(z + 2)/((z - 1)(z + 1))\n\nNow, we can see that there is no cancellation between the numerator and the denominator at z = 1. Therefore, the singularity at z = 1 is a pole. To find its order, we can look at the difference in the degrees of the numerator and the denominator:\n\nDegree of numerator: 2\nDegree of denominator: 2\n\nSince the degrees are equal, the pole at z = 1 is a simple pole (pole of order 1).\n\n2. Singularity at z = -1:\n\nAgain, there is no cancellation between the numerator and the denominator at z = -1. Therefore, the singularity at z = -1 is also a pole. The difference in the degrees of the numerator and the denominator is the same as before:\n\nDegree of numerator: 2\nDegree of denominator: 2\n\nSince the degrees are equal, the pole at z = -1 is also a simple pole (pole of order 1).\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) = (z^2 + 2z)/(z^2 - 1) has two singularities: z = 1 and z = -1. Both of these singularities are simple poles (poles of order 1). There are no removable or essential singularities in this function."
