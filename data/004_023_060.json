    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 4x - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 4x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 4x\n\nx^2 = 2x\n\nx(x - 2) = 0\n\nx = 0, x = 2\n\nSo the points of intersection are at x = 0 and x = 2.\n\nNow we'll set up the integral to find the area between the curves. We'll integrate the difference between the two functions from x = 0 to x = 2:\n\nArea = ∫(4x - x^2 - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nArea = ∫(4x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow we'll find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\n∫(4x - 2x^2) dx = 2x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow we'll evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of integration:\n\n[2(2)^2 - (2/3)(2)^3] - [2(0)^2 - (2/3)(0)^3] = [8 - (16/3)] - [0] = (8/3)\n\nSo the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 4x - x^2 is 8/3 square units."
