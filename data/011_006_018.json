    "message_2": "Let's use generating functions to solve this problem. We have 7 types of fruits, and we want to choose at least one fruit from each type. Let's represent each type of fruit with a generating function:\n\nType 1: (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... ) = x(1 + x + x^2 + ...)\nType 2: (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... ) = x(1 + x + x^2 + ...)\nType 3: (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... ) = x(1 + x + x^2 + ...)\nType 4: (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... ) = x(1 + x + x^2 + ...)\nType 5: (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... ) = x(1 + x + x^2 + ...)\nType 6: (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... ) = x(1 + x + x^2 + ...)\nType 7: (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... ) = x(1 + x + x^2 + ...)\n\nSince we want to choose at least one fruit from each type, we need to multiply these generating functions together:\n\nG(x) = x^7(1 + x + x^2 + ...)^7\n\nNow, we want to find the coefficient of x^12 in G(x). This will give us the number of ways to choose a total of 12 fruits.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the generating function using the geometric series formula:\n\nG(x) = x^7(1 - x)^(-7)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of x^12:\n\nCoefficient of x^12 = C(12 - 7 + 7 - 1, 7 - 1) = C(11, 6)\n\nUsing the combination formula:\n\nC(11, 6) = 11! / (6! * 5!) = 462\n\nSo, there are 462 ways to choose a total of 12 fruits with at least one fruit from each type."
