    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid (also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle) is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles. After each iteration, the number of triangular faces increases.\n\nLet's denote the number of triangular faces after n iterations as T(n). We start with T(0) = 1, as there is only one equilateral triangle face in the original pyramid.\n\nAt each iteration, each triangle is divided into 4 smaller triangles. Therefore, the number of new triangles added at each iteration is 3 times the number of triangles in the previous iteration.\n\nSo, we have the following recursive formula for T(n):\n\nT(n) = T(n-1) + 3 * T(n-1)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of triangular faces after 5 iterations:\n\nT(1) = T(0) + 3 * T(0) = 1 + 3 * 1 = 4\nT(2) = T(1) + 3 * T(1) = 4 + 3 * 4 = 16\nT(3) = T(2) + 3 * T(2) = 16 + 3 * 16 = 64\nT(4) = T(3) + 3 * T(3) = 64 + 3 * 64 = 256\nT(5) = T(4) + 3 * T(4) = 256 + 3 * 256 = 1024\n\nSo, after 5 iterations, there are 1024 triangular faces in the Sierpinski pyramid."
