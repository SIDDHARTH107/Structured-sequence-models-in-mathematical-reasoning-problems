    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs and claims that their bulbs have an average lifespan of 900 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. A random sample of 36 bulbs is taken to test the claim. What is the probability that the sample will have an average lifespan of less than 880 hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the sample will have an average lifespan of less than 880 hours, we can use the z-score formula for a sample mean:\n\nz = (X - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere X is the sample mean (880 hours), μ is the population mean (900 hours), σ is the population standard deviation (100 hours), and n is the sample size (36 bulbs).\n\nz = (880 - 900) / (100 / √36)\nz = (-20) / (100 / 6)\nz = (-20) / (16.67)\nz = -1.2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that corresponds to a z-score of -1.2. We can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probability.\n\nLooking up the z-score of -1.2 in the z-table, we find a probability of 0.1151 (or 11.51%).\n\nSo, there is an 11.51% probability that the sample will have an average lifespan of less than 880 hours."
