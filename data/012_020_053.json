    "message_2": "The graph G is a cycle graph with 5 vertices, also known as C5. An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. In other words, an automorphism is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) function from the vertex set to itself that maps edges to edges and non-edges to non-edges.\n\nFor the cycle graph C5, we can consider the following automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself.\n2. A clockwise rotation by one position: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) -> (2, 3, 4, 5, 1).\n3. A clockwise rotation by two positions: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) -> (3, 4, 5, 1, 2).\n4. A clockwise rotation by three positions: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) -> (4, 5, 1, 2, 3).\n5. A clockwise rotation by four positions: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) -> (5, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms for the cycle graph C5, as any other permutation would not preserve the adjacency relation. Therefore, the order of the automorphism group of graph G is 5."
