    "message_2": "A topological space X is said to be connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In other words, there are no two disjoint non-empty open sets A and B such that X = A âˆª B.\n\nLet's examine the given topology T = {{0}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2},{3,4}}. We can see that the sets {1,2} and {3,4} are both open and disjoint, i.e., their intersection is empty. Moreover, their union is {1,2,3,4}, which is also an open set in T.\n\nNow, consider the sets A = {1,2} and B = {0,3,4}. We can see that A and B are disjoint non-empty sets, and their union is X = {0,1,2,3,4}. However, B is not an open set in the given topology T, as it cannot be formed by the union of open sets in T.\n\nSince we cannot find two disjoint non-empty open sets whose union is X, the topological space X is connected."
