    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve related to the Traveler's Dilemma:\n\nConsider two travelers who have lost their luggage on a flight. They are asked to separately name a value between 1 and 100 in units of dollars to claim for compensation. The airline will choose to either pay both travelers the lower value they named or pay both travelers an amount equal to $2 more than the higher value named. If the values named by both travelers are within $2 of each other, the airline will pay both travelers the average of the two values named by them. \n\nWhat is the optimal value that each traveler should name to maximize their potential compensation?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation using game theory. We can assume that both travelers are rational and will try to maximize their compensation.\n\nSuppose one traveler names a value of x dollars, and the other traveler names a value of y dollars. There are three possible cases:\n\n1. If x = y, the airline will pay both travelers the average of the two values, which is (x + y) / 2 = x dollars.\n2. If x = y + 2, the airline will pay both travelers the higher value, which is x dollars.\n3. If x > y + 2, the airline will pay both travelers the lower value, which is y dollars.\n\nNow, let's consider the traveler who named x dollars. If they decrease their named value by $1, they will either get the same compensation or increase it by $1. This is because, in case 1, the compensation will still be x - 1 dollars, in case 2, the compensation will increase to x + 1 dollars, and in case 3, the compensation will remain y dollars.\n\nThis means that it is always better for the traveler to decrease their named value by $1. However, this logic can be applied repeatedly, leading to a \"race to the bottom\" where both travelers keep decreasing their named values. Since the minimum value they can name is $1, the optimal value for each traveler to name is $1.\n\nSo, the optimal value that each traveler should name to maximize their potential compensation is $1."
