    "message_2": "To compute the Fourier Transform of x(t), we will first compute the Fourier Series coefficients for x(t). Since x(t) is an odd function, we only need to compute the sine coefficients.\n\nThe Fourier Series representation of x(t) is given by:\n\nx(t) = ∑[b_n * sin(n * ω_0 * t)]\n\nwhere ω_0 = 2π/T, T = 2π (the period of x(t)), and b_n is the sine coefficient.\n\nTo compute the sine coefficients b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[x(t) * sin(n * ω_0 * t) dt] over the interval (-π, π)\n\nSince x(t) is defined piecewise, we will compute the integral separately for the two intervals and then add them together.\n\nFor -π < t ≤ 0, x(t) = t:\n\nb_n = (2/2π) * [∫(t * sin(n * t) dt) from -π to 0]\n\nFor 0 < t ≤ π, x(t) = -t:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(-t * sin(n * t) dt) from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n^2) * (cos(n * t)) from -π to 0] + (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * (cos(n * t)) from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n^2) * (cos(n * π) - cos(0))] + (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * (cos(n * π) - cos(0))]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n^2) * (-2) + (1/n^2) * (-2)]\n\nb_n = (-2/n^2) * (1/π)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier Series representation of x(t):\n\nx(t) = ∑[(-2/n^2) * (1/π) * sin(n * t)]\n\nThe magnitude spectrum is given by the absolute value of the coefficients:\n\n|b_n| = (2/n^2) * (1/π)\n\nThe phase spectrum is given by the phase angle of the coefficients:\n\n∠b_n = π (since the coefficients are negative)\n\nNow, you can plot the magnitude and phase spectra of x(t) over the interval (-π, π]. The magnitude spectrum will be a decaying function of n, and the phase spectrum will be a constant value of π for all n."
