    "message_2": "The given equation of the sound wave is y = 4sin(2π/3x).\n\nIn general, the equation of a sine wave is y = A*sin(Bx), where A is the amplitude and B is the angular frequency. The period (T) of the wave is related to the angular frequency by the formula T = 2π/B.\n\nFrom the given equation, we can identify the amplitude and angular frequency:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 4\nAngular frequency (B) = 2π/3\n\nNow, we can find the period (T) using the formula T = 2π/B:\n\nT = 2π / (2π/3)\nT = 2π * (3/2π)\nT = (2π * 3) / 2π\n\nThe π's cancel out:\n\nT = 3/2\n\nSo, the amplitude of the sound wave is 4, and its period is 3/2 or 1.5 units."
