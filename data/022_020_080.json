    "message_2": "To solve the boundary value problem, we first find the derivative of f(z):\n\nf'(z) = d/dz (z^2 + 3iz - 5) = 2z + 3i.\n\nNow, we have the differential equation:\n\nf'(z) + f(z) = 2e^z.\n\nSubstitute f'(z) and f(z) into the equation:\n\n(2z + 3i) + (z^2 + 3iz - 5) = 2e^z.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nz^2 + (2 + 3i)z - 2 = 2e^z.\n\nNow, let's denote g(z) = f(z) - 2e^z. Then, g'(z) = f'(z) - 2e^z. The differential equation becomes:\n\ng'(z) + g(z) = 0.\n\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫1 dz) = e^z. Multiply both sides of the equation by e^z:\n\ne^z g'(z) + e^z g(z) = 0.\n\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product e^z g(z):\n\nd/dz (e^z g(z)) = 0.\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to z:\n\ne^z g(z) = C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, solve for g(z):\n\ng(z) = Ce^(-z).\n\nRecall that g(z) = f(z) - 2e^z, so:\n\nf(z) = Ce^(-z) + 2e^z.\n\nNow, we apply the boundary condition f(i) = 0:\n\n0 = Ce^(-i) + 2e^i.\n\nSolve for C:\n\nC = -2e^(2i).\n\nTherefore, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\nf(z) = -2e^(2i) e^(-z) + 2e^z."
