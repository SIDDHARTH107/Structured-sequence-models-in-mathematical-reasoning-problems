    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the following optimization problem: \n```\nminimize f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5\nsubject to x âˆˆ [-10, 10]\n```\nUse the Bat Algorithm to find the global minimum of `f(x)` to an accuracy of `0.001`. Use a population of `10` bats and a maximum of `100` iterations. The initial pulse rate is `0.9`, the loudness is `1`, the pulse rate and loudness decrease linearly over iterations, and the minimum frequency is `0`.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Bat Algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of bats with random positions and velocities within the given range.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each bat (i.e., the value of f(x) for each bat's position).\n3. Update the position and velocity of each bat based on the Bat Algorithm rules.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the specified number of iterations.\n5.
