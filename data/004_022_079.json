    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular solid be x, y, and z. The volume of the rectangular solid is given by V = xyz, and we are given that V = 64 cubic units. So, we have:\n\nxyz = 64\n\nWe want to minimize the sum of the lengths of its edges, which is given by the function:\n\nS = 4x + 4y + 4z\n\nTo minimize S, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We will introduce a new variable λ (lambda) and form the function:\n\nF(x, y, z, λ) = 4x + 4y + 4z + λ(xyz - 64)\n\nNow, we will find the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, z, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂F/∂x = 4 + λyz = 0\n∂F/∂y = 4 + λxz = 0\n∂F/∂z = 4 + λxy = 0\n∂F/∂λ = xyz - 64 = 0\n\nFrom the first three equations, we have:\n\nλyz = -4\nλxz = -4\nλxy = -4\n\nDivide the first equation by the second equation:\n\n(λyz) / (λxz) = (-4) / (-4)\n\nyz / xz = 1\n\ny / x = 1\n\nSimilarly, divide the second equation by the third equation:\n\n(λxz) / (λxy) = (-4) / (-4)\n\nxz / xy = 1\n\nz / y = 1\n\nSince y / x = 1 and z / y = 1, we can conclude that x = y = z. Now, using the volume equation:\n\nx^3 = 64\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the sum of the lengths of its edges are x = y = z = 4 units."
