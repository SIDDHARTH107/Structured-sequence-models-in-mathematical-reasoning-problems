    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products - Product A and Product B. The profit made on Product A is $8 and the profit made on Product B is $12. The factory has 3 machines - Machine 1, Machine 2 and Machine 3. The amount of time required to produce one unit of Product A on Machine 1, Machine 2 and Machine 3 is 2 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour respectively. For Product B, the time required on each machine is 4 hours, 2 hours and 1 hour respectively. The factory has only limited machine hours available each week. Machine 1 can be used for a maximum of 40 hours, Machine 2 for a maximum of 80 hours and Machine 3 for a maximum of 70 hours. What is the maximum profit that the factory can make per week if it decides on the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to produce using the bat algorithm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 8x + 12y\n\nThe constraints are based on the machine hours available:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 40 (Machine 1)\n3x + 2y ≤ 80 (Machine 2)\nx + y ≤ 70 (Machine 3)\n\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or any optimization algorithm such as the bat algorithm. For simplicity, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 40 => y ≤ (40 - 2x) / 4 => y ≤ 10 - 0.5x\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 80 => y ≤ (80 - 3x) / 2 => y ≤ 40 - 1.5x\n3. x + y ≤ 70 => y ≤ 70 - x\n\nThe intersection points of these lines are:\n\n1. Intersection of (1) and (2): 10 - 0.5x = 40 - 1.5x => x = 30, y = 10\n2. Intersection of (1) and (3): 10 - 0.5x = 70 - x => x = 40, y = 30\n3. Intersection of (2) and (3): 40 - 1.5x = 70 - x => x = 20, y = 50\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these intersection points:\n\n1. Profit at (30, 10): 8(30) + 12(10) = 240 + 120 = $360\n2. Profit at (40, 30): 8(40) + 12(30) = 320 + 360 = $680\n3. Profit at (20, 50): 8(20) + 12(50) = 160 + 600 = $760\n\nThe maximum profit is $760 per week when producing 20 units of Product A and 50 units of Product B."
