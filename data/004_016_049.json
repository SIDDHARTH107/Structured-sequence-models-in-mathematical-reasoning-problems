According to your clock, you leave your house at exactly 8:00 am and arrive at your office at exactly 8:30 am. Using the mean value theorem, prove that at some point during your drive, you were driving at a speed of exactly 50 mph.",
    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at that point is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval:\n\nf'(c) = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)\n\nIn this problem, let f(x) represent your position (in miles) at time x (in hours). We are given that f(0) = 0 (you start at your house) and f(0.5) = 20 (you arrive at your office after 0.5 hours or 30 minutes). We want to prove that there exists a point c in the interval (0, 0.5) such that f'(c) = 50 mph.\n\nFirst, we need to show that f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 0.5] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 0.5). Since f(x) represents your position as a function of time, it is reasonable to assume that it is continuous and differentiable on the given intervals (you don't teleport or change position instantaneously).\n\nNow, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem:\n\nf'(c) = (f(0.5) - f(0)) / (0.5 - 0)\n\nf'(c) = (20 - 0) / (0.5 - 0)\n\nf'(c) = 20 / 0.5\n\nf'(c) = 40 mph\n\nSo, according to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 0.5) such that your speed at that point was exactly 40 mph, not 50 mph as stated in the problem."
