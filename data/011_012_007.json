    "message_1": "In a certain school, there are 120 students who play at least one of three sports: basketball, football or volleyball. 70 students play basketball, 60 students play football, and 50 students play volleyball. 30 students play both basketball and football, 25 students play both basketball and volleyball, and 20 students play both football and volleyball. Moreover, 10 students play all three sports. How many students only play basketball or volleyball?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students who only play basketball or volleyball, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of students who play each sport individually:\n- Basketball only: 70 - 30 (both basketball and football) - 25 (both basketball and volleyball) + 10 (all three sports) = 25\n- Football only: 60 - 30 (both basketball and football) - 20 (both football and volleyball) + 10 (all three sports) = 20\n- Volleyball only: 50 - 25 (both basketball and volleyball) - 20 (both football and volleyball) + 10 (all three sports) = 15\n\nNow, we can find the total number of students who play only basketball or only volleyball:\n25 (basketball only) + 15 (volleyball only) = 40 students."
