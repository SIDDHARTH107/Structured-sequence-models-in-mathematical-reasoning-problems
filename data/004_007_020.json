    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 1)^5 using the chain rule, we need to differentiate the outer function and the inner function separately.\n\nLet's denote the inner function as g(x) = 3x^2 + 1. Then, f(x) = (g(x))^5.\n\nFirst, we differentiate the outer function with respect to g(x). Since f(x) = (g(x))^5, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (g(x))^5 = 5(g(x))^4 * g'(x)\n\nNow, we need to differentiate the inner function g(x) = 3x^2 + 1 with respect to x:\n\ng'(x) = d/dx (3x^2 + 1) = 6x\n\nNow, we can substitute g'(x) back into the expression for f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 5(g(x))^4 * g'(x) = 5(3x^2 + 1)^4 * 6x\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of f'(2):\n\nf'(2) = 5(3(2)^2 + 1)^4 * 6(2) = 5(3(4) + 1)^4 * 12 = 5(13)^4 * 12\n\nf'(2) = 5(28561) * 12 = 1713660\n\nSo, the value of f'(2) is 1,713,660."
