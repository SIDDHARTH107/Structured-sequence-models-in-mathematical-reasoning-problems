    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a certain product. The total cost of producing x units of the product is given by C(x) = 5x + 3000, while the total revenue obtained by selling x units of the product is R(x) = 50x.\n\nThe company wants to determine the optimal price to charge for the product in order to maximize their profit. \n\nWhat is the optimal price to charge for the product, and how many units of the product should the company produce and sell to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is the profit function P(x) = R(x) - C(x).\n\nP(x) = 50x - (5x + 3000)\nP(x) = 50x - 5x - 3000\nP(x) = 45x - 3000\n\nNow we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = 45\n\nSince the derivative is a constant, there are no critical points. However, we can still find the optimal number of units to produce by considering the profit function itself. We want to maximize the profit, so we need to find the value of x that maximizes P(x).\n\nSince P(x) is a linear function, it will keep increasing as x increases. However, there must be a practical limit to the number of units that can be produced and sold. This limit is not given in the problem, so we cannot determine the exact optimal number of units to produce.\n\nAs for the optimal price to charge for the product, we can find the price per unit by dividing the revenue function by the number of units:\n\nPrice per unit = R(x) / x = 50x / x = 50\n\nSo the optimal price to charge for the product is $50 per unit. However, without knowing the practical limit on the number of units that can be produced and sold, we cannot determine the exact optimal number of units to produce."
