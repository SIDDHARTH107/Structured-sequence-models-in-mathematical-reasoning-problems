    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and C is the included angle between them.\n\nIn this case, a = 9, b = 12, and C = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 degrees * π) / 180 = π/3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 9 * 12 * sin(π/3)\n\nThe sine of π/3 (60 degrees) is √3/2, so:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 9 * 12 * (√3/2)\n\nArea = (1/2) * 9 * 12 * √3/2\n\nArea = (54 * √3)/4\n\nArea = (27 * √3)/2\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is (27√3)/2 square units."
