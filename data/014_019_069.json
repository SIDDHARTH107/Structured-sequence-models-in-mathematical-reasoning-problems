    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of columns for a transposition cipher with a plaintext message length of 36 characters and each row having at least 4 characters, we need to find the factors of 36 that are greater than or equal to 4.\n\nThe factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.\n\nSince each row must have at least 4 characters, we can eliminate the factors 1, 2, and 3. The remaining factors are 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of rows for each of these factors. The number of rows can be calculated by dividing the plaintext message length (36) by the number of columns (the factor).\n\n- For 4 columns: 36 / 4 = 9 rows\n- For 6 columns: 36 / 6 = 6 rows\n- For 9 columns: 36 / 9 = 4 rows\n- For 12 columns: 36 / 12 = 3 rows (not valid, as the number of rows must be a whole number)\n- For 18 columns: 36 / 18 = 2 rows (not valid, as the number of rows must be a whole number)\n- For 36 columns: 36 / 36 = 1 row (not valid, as the number of rows must be a whole number)\n\nThe maximum number of columns that can be used for a transposition cipher with a plaintext message length of 36 characters, with each row having at least 4 characters and the number of rows being a whole number, is 9 columns."
