    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products, product A and product B. The profits for each unit of product A and B are $10 and $15 respectively. The maximum production capacity for product A is 5000 units and for product B is 3000 units. The manufacturer wants to maximize the total profit. Write a mathematical optimization problem and find the optimal production quantities for both products.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx <= 5000 (maximum production capacity of product A)\ny <= 3000 (maximum production capacity of product B)\nx >= 0 (non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny >= 0 (non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nThe optimization problem can be written as:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 10x + 15y\nSubject to:\nx <= 5000\ny <= 3000\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities for both products, we can analyze the constraints:\n\nSince the profit per unit of product B is higher than product A, to maximize the profit, the manufacturer should produce as many units of product B as possible. Therefore, y = 3000.\n\nNow, the remaining constraint for product A is x <= 5000. Since producing more of product A will still increase the profit, the manufacturer should produce as many units of product A as possible. Therefore, x = 5000.\n\nSo, the optimal production quantities are:\nx = 5000 units of product A\ny = 3000 units of product B"
