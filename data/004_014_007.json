    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cylindrical tank using integration, we can consider the tank as a series of infinitesimally thin disks stacked on top of each other. Each disk has a thickness of \"dy\" and a radius \"r\" which is constant throughout the height of the tank. We can integrate the volume of these disks from the bottom to the top of the tank to find the total volume.\n\nThe volume of a single disk can be found using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr^2h, where \"r\" is the radius, and \"h\" is the height. In this case, the height of each disk is \"dy\", so the volume of a single disk is: dV = πr^2dy.\n\nSince the radius is constant throughout the height of the tank, we can integrate this expression with respect to \"y\" from 0 to the height of the tank (10 feet).\n\nThe radius of the tank is half of the diameter, so r = 8/2 = 4 feet.\n\nNow, we can integrate the expression for the volume of a single disk:\n\nV = ∫(π(4^2)dy) from 0 to 10\nV = ∫(16πdy) from 0 to 10\n\nIntegrating with respect to y, we get:\n\nV = 16πy | from 0 to 10\nV = 16π(10) - 16π(0)\nV = 160π\n\nSo, the volume of the cylindrical tank is 160π cubic feet."
