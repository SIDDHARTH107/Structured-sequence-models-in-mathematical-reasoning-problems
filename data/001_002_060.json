    "message_2": "To find the slope of the line passing through the points (-3, 4) and (5, -2), we can use the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere m is the slope, (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the first point, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the second point.\n\nPlugging in the given points:\n\nm = (-2 - 4) / (5 - (-3))\n\nm = (-6) / (8)\n\nm = -3/4\n\nThe slope of the line passing through the points (-3, 4) and (5, -2) is -3/4."
