    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 4sin(2x) - 5cos(3x), we will use the chain rule.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(4sin(2x))/dx - d(5cos(3x))/dx\n\nFor the first term, the outer function is 4sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 4cos(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 2. Using the chain rule:\n\nd(4sin(2x))/dx = 4cos(2x) * 2 = 8cos(2x)\n\nFor the second term, the outer function is -5cos(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 5sin(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 3. Using the chain rule:\n\nd(5cos(3x))/dx = -5sin(3x) * 3 = -15sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can combine these derivatives:\n\ndy/dx = 8cos(2x) - 15sin(3x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 8cos(2(π/6)) - 15sin(3(π/6))\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 8cos(π/3) - 15sin(π/2)\n\nUsing the trigonometric values for cos(π/3) and sin(π/2):\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 8(1/2) - 15(1)\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 4 - 15\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = -11\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 4sin(2x) - 5cos(3x) at x = π/6 is -11."
