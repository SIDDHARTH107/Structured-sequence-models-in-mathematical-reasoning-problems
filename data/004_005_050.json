    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation y' + 3y = 6x, we first find the integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y, which in this case is 3. \n\nIntegrating factor (IF) = e^(∫3 dx) = e^(3x)\n\nNow, we multiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(3x)(y' + 3y) = 6x * e^(3x)\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n(d/dx)[y * e^(3x)] = 6x * e^(3x)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(d/dx)[y * e^(3x)] dx = ∫6x * e^(3x) dx\n\nTo solve the integral on the right side, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 6x, dv = e^(3x) dx\ndu = 6 dx, v = (1/3)e^(3x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\n∫6x * e^(3x) dx = (6x * (1/3)e^(3x)) - ∫(1/3)e^(3x) * 6 dx\n= 2x * e^(3x) - 2∫e^(3x) dx\n\nNow, integrate e^(3x) with respect to x:\n\n∫e^(3x) dx = (1/3)e^(3x) + C₁\n\nSubstitute this back into the previous equation:\n\n2x * e^(3x) - 2(1/3)e^(3x) + C₂ = y * e^(3x)\n\nNow, divide by the integrating factor e^(3x) to get the general solution:\n\ny(x) = 2x - (2/3) + C * e^(-3x)\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
