    "message_2": "1. An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. In this case, we have the following automorphisms:\n\n   a. Identity (no change): {1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3}\n   b. Swap vertices 2 and 3: {1 -> 1, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 2}\n   c. Rotate the graph clockwise: {1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1}\n   d. Rotate the graph counterclockwise: {1 -> 3, 2 -> 1, 3 -> 2}\n\n2. The order of the automorphism group of this graph is the number of distinct automorphisms. In this case, there are 4 automorphisms, so the order of the automorphism group is 4."
