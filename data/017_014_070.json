    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C20, D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet the order of G be 20 = 2^2 * 5^1. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must divide 2^2 = 4 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup in G, which we will denote by P_5. Since P_5 is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_2, must divide 5^1 = 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup in G, which we will denote by P_2. If P_2 is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nIf both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G, then their product P_2 * P_5 is also a subgroup of G. Since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are relatively prime, the order of P_2 * P_5 is |P_2| * |P_5| = 4 * 5 = 20, which is the order of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is C4 × C5. Since C4 × C5 is isomorphic to C20, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20.\n\nIf n_2 = 5, then there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups in G. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to C20, as a cyclic group of order 20 has a unique subgroup of order 4. Now, we will consider the possibility of G being isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nThe dihedral group D10 has 10 elements of order 2, which form the 2-Sylow subgroups. Since there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups in G, G can be isomorphic to D10. The non-abelian group of order 20 is also isomorphic to D10, so G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20 or the non-abelian group of order 20 (which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10). Without more information about G, we cannot determine which of these two possibilities is the case."
