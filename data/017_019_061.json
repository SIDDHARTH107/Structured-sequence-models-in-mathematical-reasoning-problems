    "message_2": "To determine the possible numbers of Sylow-3 subgroups in a group of order 36, we use Sylow's Theorems. Let G be a group of order 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow-3 subgroups of G.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, n_3 must divide the order of G, which is 36. Also, n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. The only divisors that satisfy the congruence condition are 1 and 4. So, the possible numbers of Sylow-3 subgroups in a group of order 36 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, let's determine which of these possibilities can occur in non-abelian groups of order 36 and find examples for each such possibility.\n\n1. n_3 = 1: If there is only one Sylow-3 subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be the unique Sylow-3 subgroup of G, and let Q be a Sylow-2 subgroup of G. Since P is normal in G, the product PQ is a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 9 * 4 / 1 = 36, so PQ = G.\n\nNow, consider the group G = P ⋊ Q, where ⋊ denotes the semidirect product. If we can find a non-trivial action of Q on P, then G will be non-abelian. Let P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 9 and b has order 4. Define the action of Q on P by b⁻¹ab = a^k, where k is an integer not divisible by 3 (to ensure a non-trivial action). For example, let k = 2. Then, G = ⟨a, b | a^9 = b^4 = 1, b⁻¹ab = a^2⟩ is a non-abelian group of order 36 with a unique Sylow-3 subgroup.\n\n2. n_3 = 4: If there are four Sylow-3 subgroups, none of them are normal in G. An example of a non-abelian group with four Sylow-3 subgroups is the symmetric group S_3 × Z_6, where S_3 is the symmetric group on 3 elements and Z_6 is the cyclic group of order 6. The order of this group is 6 * 6 = 36, and it has four Sylow-3 subgroups, each of order 9."
