    "message_2": "To find the 7th term of the expansion of (x + y)⁹ using binomial coefficients, we can use the formula for the binomial expansion:\n\n(n choose k) * x^(n-k) * y^k\n\nwhere n is the power of the binomial (in this case, 9), k is the term number minus 1 (since we start counting from k=0), and (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFor the 7th term, k = 6 (since we start counting from k=0). So, we have:\n\n(9 choose 6) * x^(9-6) * y^6\n\nNow, we calculate the binomial coefficient (9 choose 6):\n\n(9 choose 6) = 9! / (6!(9-6)!) = 9! / (6!3!)\n\n= (9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\n= (9 × 8 × 7) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 84\n\nSo, the 7th term of the expansion of (x + y)⁹ is:\n\n84 * x^3 * y^6"
