    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval -π to π, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n, which are given by the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function, all the a_n coefficients will be zero. So, we only need to compute the b_n coefficients.\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] x * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] x * sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = sin(nx) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(nx).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor the first integral:\n∫[-π, 0] x * sin(nx) dx = [(-x/n) * cos(nx)] [-π, 0] - ∫[-π, 0] (-1/n) * cos(nx) dx\n= (π/n) * cos(nπ) - (1/n^2) * [sin(nx)] [-π, 0]\n= (π/n) * cos(nπ) + (1/n^2) * sin(nπ)\n\nFor the second integral:\n∫[0, π] x * sin(nx) dx = [(-x/n) * cos(nx)] [0, π] - ∫[0, π] (-1/n) * cos(nx) dx\n= (-π/n) * cos(nπ) - (1/n^2) * [sin(nx)] [0, π]\n= (-π/n) * cos(nπ)\n\nNow, we can combine the results:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(π/n) * cos(nπ) + (1/n^2) * sin(nπ) - (π/n) * cos(nπ)]\nb_n = (1/n^2) * sin(nπ)\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, all the b_n coefficients are also zero. However, this result is not consistent with the given condition of a jump discontinuity at x = 0. In this case, we need to consider the half-range Fourier sine series instead.\n\nThe half-range Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[n=1, ∞] B_n * sin(nx)\n\nWhere the coefficients B_n are given by:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x, we have:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts as before, we get:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * [(-π/n) * cos(nπ) - (1/n^2) * sin(nπ)]\nB_n = (2/π) * (-π/n) * cos(nπ)\n\nNow, we can write the half-range Fourier sine series for f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = ∑[n=1, ∞] [(2*(-1)^n)/n] * sin(nx)\n\nSo, the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x with a jump discontinuity at x = 0 is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[n=1, ∞] [(2*(-1)^n)/n] * sin(nx)"
