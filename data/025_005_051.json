    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the algebraic variety given by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^3 = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n2x = 0\n2y = 0\n3z^2 = 0\n\nFrom the first two equations, we get x = 0 and y = 0. From the third equation, we get z = 0. So the only singularity is the point (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow we need to determine whether this singularity is ordinary or non-ordinary. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix of the second partial derivatives and check its rank at the singularity.\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 2\n∂²f/∂y² = 2\n∂²f/∂z² = 6z\n∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n∂²f/∂x∂z = 0\n∂²f/∂y∂z = 0\n\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n\n|  2  0  0 |\n|  0  2  0 |\n|  0  0  6z |\n\nAt the singularity (0, 0, 0), the Hessian matrix becomes:\n\n|  2  0  0 |\n|  0  2  0 |\n|  0  0  0 |\n\nThe rank of this matrix is 2, which is less than the dimension of the space (3). Therefore, the singularity at (0, 0, 0) is non-ordinary."
