    "message_1": "Suppose a math student wants to compare the test scores of two different classes, Class A and Class B. They collected 10 test scores from each class and computed the mean and median scores for each class. The results are as follows: \n\nClass A - Mean score = 85, Median score = 87\n\nClass B - Mean score = 90, Median score = 83\n\nUsing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a significance level of 0.05, can the student conclude that there is a significant difference in the test scores between Class A and Class B?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the test scores from both classes and rank them from lowest to highest.\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each class.\n3. Calculate the test statistic (W) and compare it to the critical value from the Wilcoxon rank-sum table.\n\nHowever, we don't have the actual test scores, so we cannot perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test directly. We can only analyze the given mean and median scores.\n\nBased on the given information:\n\nClass A - Mean score = 85, Median score = 87\nClass B - Mean score = 90, Median score = 83\n\nWe can see that the mean score of Class B is higher than Class A, while the median score of Class A is higher than Class B. This suggests that there might be some differences in the test scores between the two classes, but we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference without performing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n\nIn conclusion, with the given information, we cannot perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and therefore cannot determine if there is a significant difference in the test scores between Class A and Class B at a significance level of 0.05. The student would need to provide the actual test scores to perform the test."
