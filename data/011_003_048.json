    "message_2": "To find the value in the 10th row and 6th column of Pascal's triangle, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the row number (counting from 0), k is the column number (counting from 0), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 9 (since we start counting from 0) and k = 5 (also counting from 0).\n\nC(9, 5) = 9! / (5! * (9-5)!)\n\nC(9, 5) = 362880 / (120 * 24)\n\nC(9, 5) = 362880 / 2880\n\nC(9, 5) = 126\n\nSo, the value in the 10th row and 6th column of Pascal's triangle is 126."
