    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first move all the terms with x to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side. \n\nAdd 2x to both sides of the equation:\n3x + 2x + 5 = 14\n\nCombine the x terms:\n5x + 5 = 14\n\nNow, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n5x = 9\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 5 to isolate x:\nx = 9/5"
