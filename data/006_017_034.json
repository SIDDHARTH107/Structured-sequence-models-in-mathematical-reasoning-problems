    "message_1": "A road has 120 accidents in a year, out of which 38% are caused by reckless driving. What is the probability that a random accident on this road is caused by reckless driving?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of an accident being caused by reckless driving, we need to divide the number of accidents caused by reckless driving by the total number of accidents.\n\nNumber of accidents caused by reckless driving = 38% of 120\n= (38/100) * 120\n= 45.6\n\nSince the number of accidents must be a whole number, we can round 45.6 to the nearest whole number, which is 46.\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability of an accident being caused by reckless driving = Number of accidents caused by reckless driving / Total number of accidents\n= 46 / 120\n\nTo express this as a simplified fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n= 23 / 60\n\nSo, the probability of a random accident on this road being caused by reckless driving is 23/60 or approximately 0.3833 (rounded to four decimal places)."
