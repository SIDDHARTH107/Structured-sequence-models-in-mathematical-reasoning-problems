    "message_1": "A company manufactures two types of products, Type A and Type B. The profit per unit of Type A is $10 and profit per unit of Type B is $15. The company has a total of 200 units of raw material available. Each unit of Type A requires 2 units of raw material and each unit of Type B requires 4 units of raw material. The company wants to maximize its profit given the available raw material. Write an integer programming problem for the company to figure out how many units of Type A and how many units of Type B it should produce to maximize its profit.",

Raw material constraint: 2x + 4y <= 200\n2. Non-negativity constraints: x >= 0, y >= 0\n3. Integer constraints: x and y must be integers\n\nThe integer programming problem can be written as:\n\nMaximize P = 10x + 15y\nSubject to:\n2x + 4y <= 200\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\nx, y âˆˆ Z"
