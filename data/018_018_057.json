    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 7}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9} - {3, 7} = {1, 5, 6, 9}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we can rewrite this as:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nWe already found these values:\n\nB Δ A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9} - {3, 7} = {1, 5, 6, 9}\n\nThus, A Δ B = B Δ A, which shows that the symmetric difference is commutative."
