    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/R)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and R is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set, at each step of the construction, the interval is divided into three equal parts, and the middle third is removed. So, the scaling factor R is 3. After the first step, there are two self-similar pieces (N = 2).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set when the construction starts with a single interval of length 1 is approximately 0.6309."
