Similarly, C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n8 ∈ A and 8 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of A are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n1 ∈ B and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ B and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n7 ∈ B and 7 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of B are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}) is a superset of each of the sets A and B."
