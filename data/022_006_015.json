    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum value of $|f(z)|$ for $|z|=3$, we first rewrite $|f(z)|$ as follows:\n\n$$|f(z)| = \\left|\\frac{z}{z-2}\\right| = \\frac{|z|}{|z-2|}$$\n\nSince $|z|=3$, we have:\n\n$$|f(z)| = \\frac{3}{|3-2|} = \\frac{3}{|1|} = 3$$\n\nNow, let's find the maximum and minimum value of $|f(z)|$ for $|z|=3$. To do this, we will use the triangle inequality, which states that for any complex numbers $a$ and $b$:\n\n$$|a+b| \\leq |a| + |b|$$\n\nApplying the triangle inequality to $|z-2|$:\n\n$$|z-2| \\geq ||z|-|2|| = |3-2| = 1$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$|f(z)| = \\frac{3}{|z-2|} \\leq \\frac{3}{1} = 3$$\n\nSince we already found that $|f(z)| = 3$ for $|z|=3$, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ is $3$.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum value of $|f(z)|$. We will use the reverse triangle inequality, which states that for any complex numbers $a$ and $b$:\n\n$$|a-b| \\geq ||a|-|b||$$\n\nApplying the reverse triangle inequality to $|z-2|$:\n\n$$|z-2| \\leq |z| + |-2| = 3 + 2 = 5$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$|f(z)| = \\frac{3}{|z-2|} \\geq \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nSince we already found that $|f(z)| = \\frac{3}{5}$ for $|z|=3$, the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ is $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ for $|z|=3$ is $3$, and the minimum value is $\\frac{3}{5}$."
