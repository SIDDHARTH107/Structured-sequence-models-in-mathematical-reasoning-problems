    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group H^1(X; F) of a compact orientable surface X of genus 3 with coefficients in the field F with 2 elements, we can use the following formula for the Betti numbers of a compact orientable surface of genus g:\n\nb_0 = 1, b_1 = 2g, b_2 = 1\n\nHere, b_0, b_1, and b_2 are the dimensions of the homology groups H_0(X; F), H_1(X; F), and H_2(X; F), respectively. Since X is a compact orientable surface of genus 3, we have g = 3. Therefore, the Betti numbers are:\n\nb_0 = 1, b_1 = 2 * 3 = 6, b_2 = 1\n\nNow, we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem to compute the cohomology groups. The theorem states that there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H_{i-1}(X; F), F) → H^i(X; F) → Hom(H_i(X; F), F) → 0\n\nFor i = 1, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H_0(X; F), F) → H^1(X; F) → Hom(H_1(X; F), F) → 0\n\nSince H_0(X; F) is a free F-module, Ext(H_0(X; F), F) = 0. Thus, the short exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → H^1(X; F) → Hom(H_1(X; F), F) → 0\n\nThis implies that H^1(X; F) is isomorphic to Hom(H_1(X; F), F). Since H_1(X; F) has dimension 6, the dimension of H^1(X; F) is also 6.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of H^1(X; F) is 6, and the rank of H^1(X; F) is also 6, as the rank is equal to the dimension when working with a field as the coefficient group."
