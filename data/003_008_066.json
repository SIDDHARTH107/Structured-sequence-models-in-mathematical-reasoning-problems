    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we first need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Since we know one of the acute angles is 45°, we can use the sine and cosine functions to find the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet A be the angle measuring 45°, and let a and b be the lengths of the sides opposite to angle A and the other acute angle, respectively. Since the triangle is a right triangle, the other acute angle is 90° - 45° = 45°. Therefore, both acute angles are 45°, which means the triangle is an isosceles right triangle, and a = b.\n\nNow, we can use the sine function to find the length of side a:\n\nsin(A) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(45°) = a / 10\n\na = 10 * sin(45°)\na ≈ 10 * 0.7071\na ≈ 7.071 cm\n\nSince a = b, the length of side b is also 7.071 cm.\n\nNow that we have the lengths of both sides, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * a * b\nArea = (1/2) * 7.071 * 7.071\nArea ≈ (1/2) * 50\nArea ≈ 25 square cm\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 25 square centimeters."
