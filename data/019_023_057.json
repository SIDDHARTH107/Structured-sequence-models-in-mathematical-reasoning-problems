    "message_1": "A math student is given this series of numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and is asked to determine the next number in the series using inductive logic. What is the next number in the series, and how did the student arrive at this answer using inductive reasoning?",
    "message_2": "The next number in the series is 12. The student can arrive at this answer using inductive reasoning by observing the pattern in the given series of numbers. The numbers are increasing by 2 each time (2, 4, 6, 8, 10). By continuing this pattern, the student can deduce that the next number in the series will be 10 + 2 = 12."
