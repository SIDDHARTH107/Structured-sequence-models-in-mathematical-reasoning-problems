    "message_1": "A circular park has a radius of 15 meters. What is the perimeter of a sector of the circle, if the central angle of the sector is 45 degrees?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the arc length. The formula for the arc length is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * π * radius\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 45 degrees and the radius is 15 meters. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nArc length = (45 / 360) * 2 * π * 15\nArc length = (1/8) * 2 * π * 15\nArc length = (1/4) * π * 15\nArc length = (15/4) * π\n\nNow, let's add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2 * radius\nPerimeter = (15/4) * π + 2 * 15\nPerimeter = (15/4) * π + 30\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (15/4) * π + 30 meters."
