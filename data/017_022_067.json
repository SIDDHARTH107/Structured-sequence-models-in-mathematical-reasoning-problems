    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 15 (the index of 2 in 60) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 20 (the index of 3 in 60) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 12 (the index of 5 in 60) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there is only one group of order 60, which is the cyclic group C60.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 60. These groups are the semi-direct products of the unique Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\n3. If n_2 = 5, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 60. These groups are the semi-direct products of the unique Sylow 5-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\n4. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there are 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 60. These groups are the semi-direct products of the unique Sylow 15-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\n5. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 1, then there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 60. These groups are the semi-direct products of the unique Sylow 10-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\n6. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 6, then there are 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 60. These groups are the semi-direct products of the unique Sylow 6-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nIn total, there are 1 (C60) + 3 + 5 + 15 + 10 + 6 = 40 non-isomorphic groups of order 60. However, we have counted some groups multiple times. The alternating group A5 × C2 is counted in cases 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, we need to subtract 2 from the total count to account for the overcounting. This leaves us with 38 non-isomorphic groups of order 60.\n\nThus, every group of order 60 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60 (38 - 2 - 4, where 4 is the number of abelian groups)."
