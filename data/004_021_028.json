    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function, we first need to find the first derivative and then differentiate it once more.\n\nThe function is f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 1.\n\nFirst, find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 1)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nNow, find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (6x^2 - 10x + 3)\nf''(x) = 12x - 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 1 is f''(x) = 12x - 10."
