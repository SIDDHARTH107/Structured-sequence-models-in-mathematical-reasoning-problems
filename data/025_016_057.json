Let's assume that we have a rational map ϕ: X → P^2 and a point p ∈ P^2 such that ϕ is birational onto its image, and ϕ^(-1)(p) = {(0,0), (1,1), (−1,0)}. Determine the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)) for generic point x ∈ X, and also for the points of ϕ^(-1)(p).",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)), we first need to find the function field K(X). Since X is a smooth projective curve given by the equation y^2 = x^4 - x^3, its function field is K(X) = K(x, y), where K is the base field.\n\nNow, let's consider the rational map ϕ: X → P^2. Since ϕ is birational onto its image, there exists a rational function f(x, y) ∈ K(X) such that ϕ(x) = f(x, y). Therefore, the field K(ϕ(x)) is a subfield of K(X) generated by f(x, y).\n\nFor a generic point x ∈ X, the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)) is the degree of the minimal polynomial of y over K(ϕ(x)). Since X is a curve of genus 3, the minimal polynomial of y has degree 2. Thus, the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)) for a generic point x ∈ X is 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the points of ϕ^(-1)(p) = {(0,0), (1,1), (−1,0)}. For each of these points, we need to determine the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)).\n\n1. For the point (0,0), we have y^2 = x^4 - x^3 = 0. Since y = 0, the minimal polynomial of y over K(ϕ(x)) is y, which has degree 1. Thus, the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)) at the point (0,0) is 1.\n\n2. For the point (1,1), we have y^2 = x^4 - x^3 = 0. Since y = 1, the minimal polynomial of y over K(ϕ(x)) is y - 1, which has degree 1. Thus, the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)) at the point (1,1) is 1.\n\n3. For the point (-1,0), we have y^2 = x^4 - x^3 = 1. Since y = 0, the minimal polynomial of y over K(ϕ(x)) is y, which has degree 1. Thus, the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)) at the point (-1,0) is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the degree of the field extension K(X)/K(ϕ(x)) for a generic point x ∈ X is 2, and for the points of ϕ^(-1)(p) = {(0,0), (1,1), (−1,0)}, the degree is 1."
