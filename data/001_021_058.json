    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 3, b = 5, and c = -2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(3)(-2))) / 2(3)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 6\n\nx = (-5 ± √49) / 6\n\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 6\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-5 + 7) / 6\nx = 2 / 6\nx = 1/3\n\nand\n\nx = (-5 - 7) / 6\nx = -12 / 6\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0 are x = 1/3 and x = -2."
