    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to design a cylindrical can with a volume of 500 cubic centimeters. The can must be made of aluminum, so the material used for the top and bottom must cost $0.05 per square centimeter, while the material used for the sides must cost $0.03 per square centimeter. What is the minimum cost for this can? (Assume that the top and bottom do not have any material wasted and that the height of the can can vary.)",
    "message_2": "Let r be the radius of the base of the cylinder and h be the height of the cylinder. The volume V of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nWe know that the volume is 500 cubic centimeters, so:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nThe surface area of the top and bottom of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nA_top_bottom = 2πr^2\n\nThe surface area of the side of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nA_side = 2πrh\n\nThe cost of the top and bottom is $0.05 per square centimeter, and the cost of the side is $0.03 per square centimeter. Therefore, the total cost C of the can is given by:\n\nC = 0.05 * A_top_bottom + 0.03 * A_side\nC = 0.05 * 2πr^2 + 0.03 * 2πrh\n\nTo minimize the cost, we will use the method of calculus. First, we need to eliminate one of the variables, either r or h. We can do this by solving the volume equation for h:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h in the cost equation:\n\nC = 0.05 * 2πr^2 + 0.03 * 2πr * (500 / (πr^2))\nC = 0.1πr^2 + 3πr / r^2\n\nNow, we will find the critical points by taking the derivative of C with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = 0.2πr - 3π / r^2\n\nTo solve for r, we can set the numerator of the derivative equal to 0:\n\n0.2πr = 3π / r^2\nr^3 = 15\nr = ∛15\n\nNow, substitute the value of r back into the equation for h:\n\nh = 500 / (π(∛15)^2)\n\nNow that we have the dimensions of the cylinder, we can find the minimum cost by plugging the values of r and h back into the cost equation:\n\nC = 0.05 * 2π(∛15)^2 + 0.03 * 2π(∛15) * (500 / (π(∛15)^2))\nC ≈ 9.42\n\nTherefore, the minimum cost for the can is approximately $9.42."
