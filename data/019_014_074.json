    "message_2": "To prove that the set of real numbers is uncountable using higher-order logic, we will use Cantor's Diagonal Argument. This argument shows that there is no bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers, which implies that the set of real numbers is uncountable.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a bijection f: ℕ → ℝ, where ℕ is the set of natural numbers and ℝ is the set of real numbers. We will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, which implies that the set of real numbers is uncountable.\n\nConsider the following function g: ℕ → {0, 1}, where g(n) = 1 - f(n)(n), i.e., g(n) is the opposite of the nth digit of the decimal expansion of the real number f(n). Note that g is well-defined, as f(n) is a real number and thus has a decimal expansion.\n\nNow, we will construct a real number r as follows: r = 0.g(1)g(2)g(3)..., where the decimal expansion of r is given by the sequence g(n). Since g(n) is either 0 or 1, r is a real number between 0 and 1.\n\nWe claim that r is not in the range of f, i.e., there is no natural number n such that f(n) = r. To see this, suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an n such that f(n) = r. Then, by the definition of g, the nth digit of the decimal expansion of f(n) is 1 - g(n). However, the nth digit of the decimal expansion of r is g(n), which is different from 1 - g(n). This is a contradiction, as f(n) and r have different decimal expansions.\n\nTherefore, r is not in the range of f, which implies that f is not a bijection between ℕ and ℝ. This contradicts our initial assumption, and thus the set of real numbers is uncountable."
