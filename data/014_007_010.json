    "message_1": "A stream cipher uses a key stream $\\{K\\}=\\{k_1,k_2,k_3,\\dots,k_n\\}$ generated by a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to encrypt plaintext $P=\\{p_1,p_2,p_3,\\dots,p_n\\}$. If the degree of the LFSR is $k=4$, and its connection polynomial is $x^4+x+1$, and the initial state is $S_0=1010$, what is the ciphertext produced from plaintext $P=0011$?",
    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext, we first need to generate the key stream using the given LFSR with the connection polynomial $x^4 + x + 1$ and initial state $S_0 = 1010$. The degree of the LFSR is $k = 4$, so we will have 4 bits in the register at any given time. We will generate the key stream for 4 bits since the plaintext has 4 bits.\n\nThe LFSR works as follows: the next bit is generated by taking the XOR of the bits in the positions corresponding to the non-zero coefficients of the connection polynomial (excluding the highest-degree term). In this case, we will XOR the first and fourth bits.\n\nInitial state: 1010\n1st iteration: (1 XOR 1) = 0 -> Shift left and add the new bit: 0100\n2nd iteration: (0 XOR 0) = 0 -> Shift left and add the new bit: 1000\n3rd iteration: (1 XOR 0) = 1 -> Shift left and add the new bit: 0001\n4th iteration: (0 XOR 1) = 1 -> Shift left and add the new bit: 0011\n\nSo, the key stream is $\\{K\\} = \\{0, 1, 0, 0\\}$.\n\nNow, we will XOR the plaintext $P = \\{0, 0, 1, 1\\}$ with the key stream $\\{K\\} = \\{0, 1, 0, 0\\}$ to get the ciphertext $C$:\n\n$C = P \\oplus K = \\{0 \\oplus 0, 0 \\oplus 1, 1 \\oplus 0, 1 \\oplus 0\\} = \\{0, 1, 1, 1\\}$\n\nTherefore, the ciphertext produced from the plaintext $P = 0011$ is $C = 0111$."
