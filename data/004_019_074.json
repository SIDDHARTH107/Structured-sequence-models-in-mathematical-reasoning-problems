Find the velocity and acceleration of the car at $t=3$ seconds, and interpret the results in terms of the car's motion.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time. The derivative of $s(t)$ with respect to $t$ is:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(2t^3 - 15t^2 + 36t) = 6t^2 - 30t + 36$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t=3$ seconds by plugging in $t=3$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(3) = 6(3)^2 - 30(3) + 36 = 6(9) - 90 + 36 = 54 - 90 + 36 = 0$\n\nThe velocity of the car at $t=3$ seconds is 0 meters per second. This means that the car is momentarily at rest at this point in time.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time. The derivative of $v(t)$ with respect to $t$ is:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t^2 - 30t + 36) = 12t - 30$\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration at $t=3$ seconds by plugging in $t=3$ into the acceleration function:\n\n$a(3) = 12(3) - 30 = 36 - 30 = 6$\n\nThe acceleration of the car at $t=3$ seconds is 6 meters per second squared. This means that the car is speeding up at this point in time, even though its velocity is momentarily 0.\n\nIn summary, at $t=3$ seconds, the car is momentarily at rest (velocity = 0 m/s) but is accelerating at a rate of 6 m/sÂ², indicating that it is speeding up."
