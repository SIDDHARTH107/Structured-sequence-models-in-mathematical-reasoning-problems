    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2} and set B = {3, 4}. Find the union of the Cartesian product of A and B and the Cartesian product of B and A, and show that they are not equal.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, we will find the union of these two sets, which is the set of all elements that are in either A x B or B x A or both.\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two Cartesian products, A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements in A x B and B x A are not the same. The ordered pairs have different arrangements of the elements from sets A and B. Therefore, the Cartesian product of A and B is not equal to the Cartesian product of B and A, i.e., A x B ≠ B x A."
