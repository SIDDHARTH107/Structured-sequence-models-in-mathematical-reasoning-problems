Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_2 × C_16, C_4 × C_8, and C_8 × C_4\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_2 × C_2 × C_8, C_2 × C_4 × C_4, and C_4 × C_2 × C_4\n4.

The Quaternion group of order 32: Q_32\n\nThese 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32 can be found using the classification of finite p-groups, where p is a prime number. In this case, p = 2, and the order of the group is 32 = 2^5."
