    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of the given signal, we can rewrite the signal using Euler's formula:\n\nf(t) = 3cos(2πt) + 2sin(6πt) + 5cos(10πt)\n     = 3[cos(2πt) + jsin(2πt)] + 2[-jsin(6πt) + jcos(6πt)] + 5[cos(10πt) + jsin(10πt)]\n     = 3e^(j2πt) - 2je^(j6πt) + 5e^(j10πt)\n\nNow, we can see that the signal is composed of three complex exponentials with different frequencies and amplitudes. The frequency domain representation of the signal is given by the amplitudes and phases of these complex exponentials.\n\n1. First frequency component:\n   Frequency: 1 Hz\n   Amplitude: 3\n   Phase: 0 (since it's a cosine function)\n\n2. Second frequency component:\n   Frequency: 3 Hz\n   Amplitude: 2\n   Phase: -90 degrees (since it's a sine function, and the phase is shifted by -90 degrees)\n\n3. Third frequency component:\n   Frequency: 5 Hz\n   Amplitude: 5\n   Phase: 0 (since it's a cosine function)\n\nSo, the frequency domain representation of the signal is:\n\nF(ω) = 3δ(ω - 2π) - 2jδ(ω - 6π) + 5δ(ω - 10π)\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function."
