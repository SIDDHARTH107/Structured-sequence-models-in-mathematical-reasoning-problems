We can convert it back to the system of linear equations:\n\nx + 1/5z = 0\ny - 3/5z = 0\n\nNow, let z = t, where t is a parameter. Then, we can express x and y in terms of t:\n\nx = -1/5t\ny = 3/5t\n\nThe general solution for the given homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -1/5t\ny = 3/5t\nz = t\n\nwhere t is a free parameter."
