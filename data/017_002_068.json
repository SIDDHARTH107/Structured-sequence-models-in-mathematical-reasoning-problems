    "message_2": "To determine whether the subgroup H generated by a^4 is cyclic, we will first find the order of H. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group.\n\nSince G is a cyclic group of order 16, we have a^16 = e. Now, let's consider the element a^4:\n\n(a^4)^4 = a^(4*4) = a^16 = e\n\nThis means that the order of a^4 is at most 4. Now, we need to check if there is a smaller positive integer n such that (a^4)^n = e:\n\nFor n = 1: (a^4)^1 = a^4 ≠ e (since a^4 generates H and H is a non-trivial subgroup)\nFor n = 2: (a^4)^2 = a^8 ≠ e (since if a^8 = e, then the order of a would be 8, which contradicts the fact that the order of a is 16)\nFor n = 3: (a^4)^3 = a^12 ≠ e (since if a^12 = e, then the order of a would be a divisor of 12, which contradicts the fact that the order of a is 16)\n\nThus, the order of a^4 is indeed 4. Since a^4 has finite order, the subgroup H generated by a^4 is cyclic. The generator of H is a^4, and H = {e, a^4, a^8, a^12}."
