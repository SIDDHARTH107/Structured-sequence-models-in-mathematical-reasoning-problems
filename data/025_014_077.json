Let P_1 = (0,i), P_2 = (2i,0) and P_3 = (-2,-2i). Find the divisor D = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 on C and compute the rank of the associated Jacobi variety J(C).",
    "message_2": "First, we need to check if the given points P_1, P_2, and P_3 are actually on the curve C. To do this, we plug the x and y coordinates of each point into the equation of the curve and see if it holds true.\n\nFor P_1 = (0, i):\ny^2 = x^6 + 6x^4 - 2x^3 - 12x + 1\n(i)^2 = (0)^6 + 6(0)^4 - 2(0)^3 - 12(0) + 1\n-1 = 1\n\nSince -1 ≠ 1, P_1 is not on the curve C over the field of rational numbers.\n\nFor P_2 = (2i, 0):\ny^2 = x^6 + 6x^4 - 2x^3 - 12x + 1\n(0)^2 = (2i)^6 + 6(2i)^4 - 2(2i)^3 - 12(2i) + 1\n0 = -256 + 96i\n\nSince 0 ≠ -256 + 96i, P_2 is not on the curve C over the field of rational numbers.\n\nFor P_3 = (-2, -2i):\ny^2 = x^6 + 6x^4 - 2x^3 - 12x + 1\n(-2i)^2 = (-2)^6 + 6(-2)^4 - 2(-2)^3 - 12(-2) + 1\n-4 = 64 - 32 + 8 + 24 + 1\n\nSince -4 ≠ 65, P_3 is not on the curve C over the field of rational numbers.\n\nSince none of the given points are on the curve C over the field of rational numbers, we cannot form a divisor D = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 on C. Consequently, we cannot compute the rank of the associated Jacobi variety J(C) using these points."
