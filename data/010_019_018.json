    "message_2": "Let $M$ be a compact connected manifold of dimension $n$ with boundary, and let $f:M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function with no degenerate critical points on the boundary. Suppose that $f$ has exactly two critical points on $M$: a local minimum and a local maximum. Let $k_n$ be the rank of the Morse homology group $H_n(M)$.\n\nRecall that the Euler characteristic of $M$, denoted by $\\chi(M)$, can be computed as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension in a cell decomposition of $M$. In our case, we have a Morse complex for $f$, which gives us a cell decomposition of $M$. Let $c_i$ be the number of critical points of index $i$ in $f$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\chi(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i c_i$.\n\nSince $f$ has exactly two critical points, a local minimum and a local maximum, we have $c_0 = 1$ and $c_n = 1$, and $c_i = 0$ for all $i \\neq 0, n$. Therefore, the Euler characteristic of $M$ is given by:\n\n$\\chi(M) = 1 - c_n$.\n\nNow, we want to find $k_n$, the rank of the Morse homology group $H_n(M)$. Recall that the Morse inequalities relate the ranks of the homology groups to the number of critical points of each index. In particular, we have:\n\n$k_n = \\text{rank}(H_n(M)) \\leq c_n$.\n\nSince $c_n = 1$, we have $k_n \\leq 1$. However, we also know that $k_n \\geq 0$, as the rank of a homology group is always non-negative. Therefore, we have two possibilities: $k_n = 0$ or $k_n = 1$.\n\nNow, we can use the information about the Euler characteristic to determine which of these possibilities holds. If $k_n = 0$, then $\\chi(M) = 1$. If $k_n = 1$, then $\\chi(M) = 0$. Thus, we have:\n\n$k_n = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\chi(M) = 0, \\\\\n0, & \\text{if } \\chi(M) = 1.\n\\end{cases}$\n\nSo, the rank of the Morse homology group $H_n(M)$, $k_n$, is determined by the Euler characteristic of $M$: it is 1 if $\\chi(M) = 0$, and 0 if $\\chi(M) = 1$."
