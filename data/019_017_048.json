    "message_2": "1. $M \\models \\varphi$\n\nIn the model $M = (\\mathbb{Z}, +)$, the binary function symbol $f$ is interpreted as the addition operation. So, $f(x, y) = x + y$. We need to check if there exists an element $x$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$ such that for all elements $y$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$, $x + y = x$. \n\nLet's consider the element $x = 0$. For any $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we have $0 + y = y$. Thus, in this case, $f(x, y) = x$. Therefore, $M \\models \\varphi$ is true.\n\n2. Every model of $Th(\\mathbb{Z},+)$ satisfies $\\varphi$\n\n$Th(\\mathbb{Z},+)$ is the set of all sentences in the language of arithmetic that are true in the structure $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$. Since we have shown that $M \\models \\varphi$ is true, it means that $\\varphi$ is a member of $Th(\\mathbb{Z},+)$. \n\nNow, let's consider any model $N$ of $Th(\\mathbb{Z},+)$. Since $N$ is a model of $Th(\\mathbb{Z},+)$, it must satisfy all the sentences in $Th(\\mathbb{Z},+)$. In particular, it must satisfy $\\varphi$. Therefore, every model of $Th(\\mathbb{Z},+)$ satisfies $\\varphi$ is true."
