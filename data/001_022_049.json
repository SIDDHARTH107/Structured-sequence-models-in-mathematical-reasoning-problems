    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the equation y = x^4 - 4x^3 - 7x^2 + 36x - 45, we need to set y to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^4 - 4x^3 - 7x^2 + 36x - 45\n\nThis is a quartic polynomial equation, and finding the exact roots can be quite challenging. However, we can try to find the possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, -45) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nFactors of -45: ±1, ±3, ±5, ±9, ±15, ±45\n\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, we only need to test these factors as potential rational roots.\n\nTesting these factors, we find that x = 3 is a root:\n\n0 = (3)^4 - 4(3)^3 - 7(3)^2 + 36(3) - 45\n0 = 81 - 108 - 63 + 108 - 45\n0 = 0\n\nNow that we know x = 3 is a root, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining cubic polynomial:\n\n(x^4 - 4x^3 - 7x^2 + 36x - 45) / (x - 3)\n\nUsing synthetic division or long division, we find that the quotient is:\n\nx^3 - x^2 - 10x + 15\n\nNow we need to find the roots of this cubic polynomial. Unfortunately, there is no simple method to find the exact roots of a general cubic polynomial. However, we can use numerical methods (such as the Newton-Raphson method) or graphing software to approximate the roots.\n\nUsing a graphing software or numerical methods, we find the following approximate roots for the cubic polynomial:\n\nx ≈ 1.405\nx ≈ -1.702\nx ≈ 6.297\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the given equation are approximately:\n\nx ≈ 3, 1.405, -1.702, 6.297"
