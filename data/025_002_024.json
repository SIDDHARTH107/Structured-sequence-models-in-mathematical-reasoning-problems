    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of the two curves, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$$f(x,y) = x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 - y^3 = 0$$\n$$g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2 = 0$$\n\nFirst, let's solve the second equation for $x^2$:\n\n$$x^2 = 2 - y^2$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $x^2$ into the first equation:\n\n$$f(x,y) = (2 - y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} - 3(2 - y^2)(y^2) + 3(2 - y^2)(y^4) - y^6 = 0$$\n\nThis is a polynomial equation in $y^2$. Let $z = y^2$, then the equation becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = (2 - z)^{\\frac{3}{2}} - 3(2 - z)z + 3(2 - z)(z^2) - z^3 = 0$$\n\nNow, let's find the roots of this polynomial equation. We can start by checking for integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The only possible rational roots are $\\pm1, \\pm2$. We can check that none of these are roots of the polynomial equation. \n\nNext, we can try to find the roots numerically. Using a numerical solver, we find that the polynomial equation has three real roots:\n\n$$z_1 \\approx 0.439, \\quad z_2 \\approx 1.561, \\quad z_3 \\approx 2.000$$\n\nSince $z = y^2$, we can find the corresponding values of $y$:\n\n$$y_1 \\approx \\pm\\sqrt{0.439}, \\quad y_2 \\approx \\pm\\sqrt{1.561}, \\quad y_3 \\approx \\pm\\sqrt{2.000}$$\n\nFor each value of $y$, we can find the corresponding value of $x$ using the equation $x^2 = 2 - y^2$:\n\n$$x_1 \\approx \\pm\\sqrt{2 - 0.439}, \\quad x_2 \\approx \\pm\\sqrt{2 - 1.561}, \\quad x_3 \\approx \\pm\\sqrt{2 - 2.000}$$\n\nSo, we have a total of 6 intersection points:\n\n$$(x_1, y_1) \\approx (\\pm\\sqrt{1.561}, \\pm\\sqrt{0.439})$$\n$$(x_2, y_2) \\approx (\\pm\\sqrt{0.439}, \\pm\\sqrt{1.561})$$\n$$(x_3, y_3) \\approx (\\pm\\sqrt{0}, \\pm\\sqrt{2})$$\n\nThus, the two curves intersect at 6 points."
