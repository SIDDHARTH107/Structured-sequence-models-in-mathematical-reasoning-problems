    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n3x^2 + 6x = 3x(x + 2)\n\nDenominator:\n6x^3 - 27x = 3x(2x^2 - 9)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the rational expression as:\n\n(3x(x + 2)) / (3x(2x^2 - 9))\n\nWe can now cancel out the common term 3x from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(3x(x + 2)) / (3x(2x^2 - 9)) = (x + 2) / (2x^2 - 9)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(x + 2) / (2x^2 - 9)"
