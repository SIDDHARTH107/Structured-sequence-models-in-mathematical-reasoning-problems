    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to determine the girth of G, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nLet's denote the number of vertices with degree 1, 2, 3, and 4 as n1, n2, n3, and n4, respectively. Since there are 8 vertices in total, we have:\n\nn1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 8\n\nThe sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to 2 * 10 = 20, so we have:\n\nn1 * 1 + n2 * 2 + n3 * 3 + n4 * 4 = 20\n\nNow, let's consider the possible girths for the graph G:\n\n1. If the girth is 3, then the graph must contain a triangle. In this case, every vertex must have a degree of at least 2. This means that n1 = 0, and we have:\n\nn2 + n3 + n4 = 8\nn2 * 2 + n3 * 3 + n4 * 4 = 20\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get n2 = 4, n3 = 2, and n4 = 2. This is a valid solution, so the girth of G can be 3.\n\n2. If the girth is 4, then the graph must contain a quadrilateral. In this case, every vertex must have a degree of at least 2, except for the two vertices that are part of the quadrilateral but not connected by an edge. This means that n1 = 0 and n2 >= 2. However, since we already found a solution with girth 3, we don't need to consider this case further.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph G is 3."
