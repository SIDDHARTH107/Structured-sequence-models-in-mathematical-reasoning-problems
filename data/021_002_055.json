    "message_1": "Consider the matrix A = [3 1; 1 3]. Use the power iteration method to find the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector with an initial guess of [1; 1]. Perform iterations until the eigenvalue estimate does not change by more than 0.01.",
    "message_2": "Let's perform the power iteration method step by step:\n\n1. Normalize the initial guess vector:\nv0 = [1; 1]\n||v0|| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)\nv0_normalized = [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)]\n\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the normalized vector:\nA * v0_normalized = [3 1; 1 3] * [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)] = [2*sqrt(2); 2*sqrt(2)]\n\n3. Normalize the resulting vector:\nv1 = [2*sqrt(2); 2*sqrt(2)]\n||v1|| = sqrt((2*sqrt(2))^2 + (2*sqrt(2))^2) = 4\nv1_normalized = [sqrt(2)/2; sqrt(2)/2]\n\n4. Multiply the matrix A by the normalized vector:\nA * v1_normalized = [3 1; 1 3] * [sqrt(2)/2; sqrt(2)/2] = [2; 2]\n\n5. Normalize the resulting vector:\nv2 = [2; 2]\n||v2|| = sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = 2*sqrt(2)\nv2_normalized = [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)]\n\nNotice that v2_normalized is the same as v0_normalized. This means that the power iteration method has converged, and we can estimate the largest eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue = (v2_normalized' * A * v2_normalized) / (v2_normalized' * v2_normalized)\nEigenvalue = ([1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2)] * [3 1; 1 3] * [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)]) / ([1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2)] * [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)])\nEigenvalue = (4) / (1)\nEigenvalue = 4\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue is 4, and its corresponding eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)]."
