    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 5 cm and r = 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 5 * 3^2\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 5 * 9\nVolume = 90 * π^2 cubic centimeters"
