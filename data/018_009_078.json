The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A × B) × {6}. We will use the ordered pairs from A × B and the set {6}.\n\n(A × B) × {6} = {((1, 3), 6), ((1, 4), 6), ((2, 3), 6), ((2, 4), 6)}"
