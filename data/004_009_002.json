    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x - 1)(x^2 + 3x + 5) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions that are being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x - 1\nv(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5\n\nNext, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2 (the derivative of 2x - 1)\nv'(x) = 2x + 3 (the derivative of x^2 + 3x + 5)\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\n(f(x) = u(x)v(x))' = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf'(x) = (2)(x^2 + 3x + 5) + (2x - 1)(2x + 3)\n\nNow, we can distribute and simplify:\n\nf'(x) = 2x^2 + 6x + 10 + 4x^2 - 2x + 6x - 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x + 7\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x - 1)(x^2 + 3x + 5) is:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x + 7"
