    "message_2": "To determine the stability of a control system using the transfer function G(s), we need to analyze the poles of the system. The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero.\n\nGiven the transfer function G(s) = 5/(s^2 + 10s + 25), we first need to find the poles by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\ns^2 + 10s + 25 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for s using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 10, and c = 25. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\ns = (-10 ± √(10^2 - 4*1*25)) / 2*1\ns = (-10 ± √(100 - 100)) / 2\ns = (-10 ± 0) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is equal to zero, there is only one unique solution for s:\n\ns = -10 / 2\ns = -5\n\nThe system has one pole at s = -5. A system is stable if all its poles have negative real parts. Since the real part of the pole is negative (-5), the control system is stable."
