    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The smallest perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8,128, which are all generated using the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers.\n\nTo find the smallest perfect number greater than 10,000, we need to find the next prime number p for which 2^p - 1 is also prime. The next such prime number is p = 13, for which 2^13 - 1 = 8,191 is also prime.\n\nUsing the formula, the smallest perfect number greater than 10,000 is:\n\n2^(13-1) * (2^13 - 1) = 2^12 * 8,191 = 4,096 * 8,191 = 33,550,336"
