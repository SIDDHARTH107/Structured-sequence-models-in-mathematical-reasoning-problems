    "message_2": "Let X = {1,2,3}. The power set of X, denoted as P(X), is the set of all possible subsets of X, including the empty set and X itself. To find the cardinality of the power set of X, we can list all the subsets:\n\nP(X) = {âˆ…, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}}\n\nThere are 8 subsets in P(X), so the cardinality of P(X) is 8.\n\nNow let's compare the cardinality of P(X) with the cardinality of X itself. The cardinality of X is the number of elements in X, which is 3 (since X = {1,2,3}).\n\nSince the cardinality of P(X) is 8 and the cardinality of X is 3, we can see that the power set of X has strictly more elements than X (8 > 3)."
