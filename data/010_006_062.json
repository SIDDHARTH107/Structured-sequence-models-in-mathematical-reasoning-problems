    "message_2": "The first homotopy group of the unit circle $S^1$ with base point $p_0 = (1,0)$ is the group of homotopy classes of loops based at $p_0$. This group is called the fundamental group and is denoted by $\\pi_1(S^1, p_0)$.\n\nFor the unit circle $S^1$, the first homotopy group is isomorphic to the group of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. This is because loops in $S^1$ can be classified by the number of times they wind around the circle, with positive integers representing counterclockwise winding and negative integers representing clockwise winding. The homotopy classes of loops can be added by concatenating loops, and this operation corresponds to the addition of integers.\n\nSo, the first homotopy group of the unit circle $S^1$ with base point $p_0 = (1,0)$ is $\\pi_1(S^1, p_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
