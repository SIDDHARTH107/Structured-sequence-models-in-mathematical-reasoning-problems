    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches all the faces of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. In this case, the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm.\n\nThe radius (r) of the sphere is half of the diameter, so r = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume (V) of a sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nSubstitute the value of r into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3 cm)^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(27 cm^3)\n\nV = (36/3)π cm^3\n\nV = 36π cm^3\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is 36π cubic centimeters."
