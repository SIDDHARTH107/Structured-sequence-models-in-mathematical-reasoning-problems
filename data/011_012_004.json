    "message_1": "In a group of 50 students, 25 are studying French, 30 are studying Spanish, and 15 are studying both French and Spanish. How many students are not studying French or Spanish?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nThe total number of students studying French or Spanish is the sum of the number of students studying French and the number of students studying Spanish, minus the number of students studying both languages (since they are counted twice).\n\nTotal students studying French or Spanish = (Students studying French) + (Students studying Spanish) - (Students studying both)\n\nTotal students studying French or Spanish = 25 + 30 - 15 = 40\n\nNow, we have a total of 50 students in the group, so the number of students not studying French or Spanish is:\n\nTotal students - Total students studying French or Spanish = 50 - 40 = 10\n\nSo, 10 students are not studying French or Spanish."
