What is the minimum number of people needed to guarantee that there are always three mutual friends or three mutual strangers among them?",
    "message_2": "The minimum number of people needed to guarantee that there are always three mutual friends or three mutual strangers among them is 6. This is known as Ramsey's theorem, specifically R(3,3) = 6. \n\nTo understand why, consider a group of 5 people. It is possible to arrange their friendships in such a way that there are no groups of three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. However, when you add a sixth person to the group, it becomes impossible to avoid having either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. This is because when the sixth person is friends with three or more of the others, they will either form a group of three mutual friends or force a group of three mutual strangers to exist among the remaining people."
