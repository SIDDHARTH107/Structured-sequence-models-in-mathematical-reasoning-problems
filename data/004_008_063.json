    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line at x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4)/dx = 6x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2)^2 - 10(2) + 3 = 6(4) - 20 + 3 = 24 - 20 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at x = 2 is 7."
