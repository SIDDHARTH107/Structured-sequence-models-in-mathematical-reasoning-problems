    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose the stock price for a certain company is currently $S_0 = 100$, the annual interest rate is $r = 0.02$, the volatility of the stock price is $\\sigma = 0.3$, the strike price for a call option is $K = 110$, and the time to maturity for the option is $T = 1$ year. Using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for option pricing with stochastic volatility, what is the price of the call option?",
    "message_2": "To find the price of the call option, we can use the Black-Scholes-Merton formula:\n\n$C(S_0, K, T, r, \\sigma) = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$\n\nwhere $N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are given by:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{S_0}{K}) + (r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}$\n\n$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T}$\n\nGiven the values $S_0 = 100$, $K = 110$, $T = 1$, $r = 0.02$, and $\\sigma = 0.3$, we can calculate $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{100}{110}) + (0.02 + \\frac{0.3^2}{2})(1)}{0.3 \\sqrt{1}} \\approx -0.4504$\n\n$d_2 = -0.4504 - 0.3 \\sqrt{1} \\approx -0.7504$\n\nNow, we can find the values of $N(d_1)$ and $N(d_2)$ using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator:\n\n$N(d_1) \\approx 0.3264$\n\n$N(d_2) \\approx 0.2266$\n\nFinally, we can plug these values into the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to find the price of the call option:\n\n$C(100, 110, 1, 0.02, 0.3) = 100 \\times 0.3264 - 110 \\times e^{-0.02} \\times 0.2266 \\approx 32.64 - 107.82 \\times 0.2266 \\approx 32.64 - 24.42 \\approx 8.22$\n\nSo, the price of the call option is approximately $8.22."
