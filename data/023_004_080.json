    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-5|x|), we first need to express the function in terms of a piecewise function since the absolute value of x is involved. We can write f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = e^(-5x) for x ≥ 0\nf(x) = e^(5x) for x < 0\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(k) of f(x) using the following integral formula:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nWe need to calculate the integral separately for the two cases (x ≥ 0 and x < 0) and then sum the results:\n\nFor x ≥ 0:\nF1(k) = ∫[e^(-5x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from 0 to ∞\n\nFor x < 0:\nF2(k) = ∫[e^(5x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from -∞ to 0\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\nF1(k) = ∫[e^(-5x - 2πikx)] dx from 0 to ∞\nF1(k) = [(-1/(5 + 2πik)) * e^(-5x - 2πikx)] from 0 to ∞\nF1(k) = (-1/(5 + 2πik)) * (0 - 1)\nF1(k) = 1/(5 + 2πik)\n\nF2(k) = ∫[e^(5x - 2πikx)] dx from -∞ to 0\nF2(k) = [(1/(5 - 2πik)) * e^(5x - 2πikx)] from -∞ to 0\nF2(k) = (1/(5 - 2πik)) * (1 - 0)\nF2(k) = 1/(5 - 2πik)\n\nNow, we can sum F1(k) and F2(k) to obtain the Fourier transform F(k):\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k)\nF(k) = 1/(5 + 2πik) + 1/(5 - 2πik)\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can find a common denominator:\n\nF(k) = [(5 - 2πik) + (5 + 2πik)] / [(5 + 2πik)(5 - 2πik)]\nF(k) = (10) / (25 - (2πik)^2)\nF(k) = 10 / (25 + 4π^2k^2)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-5|x|) is:\n\nF(k) = 10 / (25 + 4π^2k^2)"
