    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base of length 6 cm and width 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. Calculate the volume of the pyramid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base area * Height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid is the area of the rectangle, which can be calculated as:\n\nBase area = Length * Width = 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 24 cm² * 5 cm = (1/3) * 120 cm³ = 40 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 40 cubic centimeters."
