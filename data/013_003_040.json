    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, a proposer is given $10 to split with a responder. The proposer suggests a split to the responder, who can either accept or reject the offer. If the responder accepts the split, both players get the proposed amount, but if the responder rejects, both players get nothing. What is the smallest amount the proposer can offer to ensure that the responder accepts the split?",
    "message_2": "In an Ultimatum Game, the smallest amount the proposer can offer to ensure that the responder accepts the split is $0.01. This is because the responder would still receive a positive amount of money, and accepting the offer would be better than rejecting it and getting nothing. However, this assumes that the responder is purely rational and only cares about maximizing their own monetary gain. In reality, people may reject such an unfair offer due to factors like fairness, social norms, or emotions."
