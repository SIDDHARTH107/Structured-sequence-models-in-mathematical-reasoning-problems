    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nLet f(z) = (z^3 - z)/(z^2 + 1)^2 be a meromorphic function on the complex plane. Find all poles of f(z) and their orders.",
    "message_2": "To find the poles of the function f(z) = (z^3 - z)/(z^2 + 1)^2, we first need to find the zeros of the denominator (z^2 + 1)^2.\n\nLet's set the denominator to zero and solve for z:\n\n(z^2 + 1)^2 = 0\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nNow, solving for z:\n\nz^2 = -1\nz = ±√(-1)\nz = ±i\n\nSo, the zeros of the denominator are z = i and z = -i. These are the potential poles of the function f(z). Now we need to determine their orders.\n\nThe order of a pole is the number of times it appears as a zero in the denominator. In this case, since we have (z^2 + 1)^2 in the denominator, the order of both poles i and -i is 2.\n\nTherefore, the function f(z) has two poles at z = i and z = -i, both of order 2."
