    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly removing triangles from an initial square or triangle. In each iteration, the remaining area is reduced by a factor of 3/4, since one of the four smaller squares is removed.\n\nLet's calculate the total area of the squares after five iterations:\n\nInitial area: 64 cm²\n\nAfter 1st iteration: 64 * (3/4) = 48 cm²\n\nAfter 2nd iteration: 48 * (3/4) = 36 cm²\n\nAfter 3rd iteration: 36 * (3/4) = 27 cm²\n\nAfter 4th iteration: 27 * (3/4) = 20.25 cm²\n\nAfter 5th iteration: 20.25 * (3/4) = 15.1875 cm²\n\nSo, the total area of the squares after five iterations would be approximately 15.19 cm²."
