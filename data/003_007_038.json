    "message_2": "To find the measure of the angle opposite the side with length 8 cm, we will use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides, respectively:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this problem, we have a = 6 cm, b = 8 cm, and c = 10 cm. We want to find the angle B opposite the side with length 8 cm. Plugging in the given side lengths into the Law of Cosines formula, we get:\n\n10² = 6² + 8² - 2 * 6 * 8 * cos(B)\n\n100 = 36 + 64 - 96 * cos(B)\n\n100 = 100 - 96 * cos(B)\n\nNow, isolate cos(B):\n\n0 = -96 * cos(B)\n\ncos(B) = 0\n\nNow, we find the angle B by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0:\n\nB = arccos(0)\n\nB = 90°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side with length 8 cm is 90°."
