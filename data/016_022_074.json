    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal created by repeatedly removing smaller tetrahedra from the initial larger tetrahedron. In each stage, the number of removed tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nIn the first stage, 1 tetrahedron is removed, leaving 4 smaller tetrahedra. In the second stage, 4 more tetrahedra are removed from each of the 4 smaller tetrahedra, resulting in a total of 4^2 = 16 smaller tetrahedra. This pattern continues for each stage.\n\nThe total number of triangles in the nth stage of the Sierpinski pyramid construction can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = 4^n\n\nFor the seventh stage, we have:\n\nTotal triangles = 4^7 = 16,384\n\nSo, there are 16,384 triangles in the seventh stage of the Sierpinski pyramid construction."
