    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = e^(2z)/(z-1) in the annulus 1 < |z| < 3, we first need to rewrite the function in a form that allows us to expand it using the geometric series.\n\nLet's rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = e^(2z) * (1/(z-1))\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series expansion for 1/(z-1) in the given annulus:\n\n1/(z-1) = -1/(1-z) = -1 * Σ(z^n) for n=0 to ∞, where 1 < |z| < 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the expansion of e^(2z). The Taylor series expansion of e^(2z) is:\n\ne^(2z) = Σ((2z)^n / n!) for n=0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) by multiplying the expansions of e^(2z) and 1/(z-1):\n\nf(z) = (-1) * Σ(z^n) * Σ((2z)^m / m!) for n=0 to ∞ and m=0 to ∞.\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can combine the summations into a single summation:\n\nf(z) = - Σ( Σ((2z)^(n+m) / m!) ) for n=0 to ∞ and m=0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the terms to get the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = - Σ( (2^(n+m) / m!) * z^(n+m) ) for n=0 to ∞ and m=0 to ∞.\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = e^(2z)/(z-1) in the annulus 1 < |z| < 3."
