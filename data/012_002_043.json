    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nEdges: {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,5}, {3,6}, {4,5}, {4,6}, {5,6}, {6,7}\n\nWe can try to color the vertices using the greedy coloring algorithm, which colors the vertices in order, assigning the smallest possible color to each vertex.\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A: {A, _, _, _, _, _, _}\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's connected to vertex 1): {A, B, _, _, _, _, _}\n3. Color vertex 3 with color C (since it's connected to vertices 1 and 2): {A, B, C, _, _, _, _}\n4. Color vertex 4 with color B (since it's connected to vertex 1, but not 2): {A, B, C, B, _, _, _}\n5. Color vertex 5 with color A (since it's connected to vertices 2 and 4, but not 1): {A, B, C, B, A, _, _}\n6. Color vertex 6 with color B (since it's connected to vertices 1, 3, and 5, but not 2): {A, B, C, B, A, B, _}\n7. Color vertex 7 with color A (since it's connected to vertex 6, but not 1): {A, B, C, B, A, B, A}\n\nThe graph G can be colored using 3 colors (A, B, and C) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is 3."
