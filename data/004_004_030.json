    "message_2": "To find the area bound by the x-axis, x = 2, x = 4, and the curve y = x^2 - 3x + 1, we will use definite integration. We will integrate the function y = x^2 - 3x + 1 with respect to x from the lower limit of 2 to the upper limit of 4.\n\n∫(x^2 - 3x + 1)dx from 2 to 4\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\n∫(x^2 - 3x + 1)dx = (1/3)x^3 - (3/2)x^2 + x + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits and subtract the results:\n\n[(1/3)(4)^3 - (3/2)(4)^2 + (4)] - [(1/3)(2)^3 - (3/2)(2)^2 + (2)]\n\n= [(1/3)(64) - (3/2)(16) + 4] - [(1/3)(8) - (3/2)(4) + 2]\n\n= [21.333 - 2.667]\n\n= 18.666\n\nSo, the area bound by the x-axis, x = 2, x = 4, and the curve y = x^2 - 3x + 1 is 18.666 square units."
