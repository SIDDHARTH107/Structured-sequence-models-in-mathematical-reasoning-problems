Suppose the first Chern class of $TM$ is given by $c_1(TM)=2a$, where $a$ is a non-zero complex number. Find the $n$th Chern class of $TM$, i.e., express $c_n(TM)$ in terms of $a$ and $n$.",
    "message_2": "To find the $n$th Chern class of $TM$, we will use the splitting principle and the Chern classes of line bundles. The splitting principle states that given a vector bundle $E$ over a space $X$, there exists a space $Y$ and a map $f: Y \\to X$ such that $f^*E$ splits into a direct sum of line bundles. In our case, we have the tangent bundle $TM$ over the complex manifold $M$.\n\nLet $L_1, L_2, \\dots, L_n$ be the line bundles such that $TM = L_1 \\oplus L_2 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus L_n$. The total Chern class of $TM$ is given by the product of the total Chern classes of the line bundles:\n\n$$c(TM) = c(L_1)c(L_2)\\cdots c(L_n).$$\n\nThe total Chern class of a line bundle $L_i$ is given by $c(L_i) = 1 + c_1(L_i)$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$c(TM) = (1 + c_1(L_1))(1 + c_1(L_2))\\cdots(1 + c_1(L_n)).$$\n\nNow, we know that $c_1(TM) = 2a$. Since the first Chern class is additive, we have\n\n$$c_1(TM) = c_1(L_1) + c_1(L_2) + \\cdots + c_1(L_n) = 2a.$$\n\nTo find the $n$th Chern class, we need to find the $n$th elementary symmetric polynomial in the $c_1(L_i)$'s. Let $e_n$ denote the $n$th elementary symmetric polynomial. Then, we have\n\n$$c_n(TM) = e_n(c_1(L_1), c_1(L_2), \\dots, c_1(L_n)).$$\n\nUsing Newton's identities, we can express the elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums. In particular, we have\n\n$$e_n = \\frac{1}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) p_{\\sigma(1)}p_{\\sigma(2)}\\cdots p_{\\sigma(n)},$$\n\nwhere $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ elements, $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$ is the sign of the permutation $\\sigma$, and $p_k = c_1(L_1)^k + c_1(L_2)^k + \\cdots + c_1(L_n)^k$ is the $k$th power sum.\n\nNow, we know that $p_1 = c_1(TM) = 2a$. To find the other power sums, we can use the identity\n\n$$p_k = k\\sum_{i=1}^n c_1(L_i)^{k-1}c_1(L_i).$$\n\nSince $c_1(TM) = 2a$, we have\n\n$$p_k = k\\sum_{i=1}^n c_1(L_i)^{k-1}(2a - \\sum_{j \\neq i} c_1(L_j)).$$\n\nNow, we can plug these power sums into the expression for $e_n$ and simplify to obtain\n\n$$c_n(TM) = \\frac{1}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) p_{\\sigma(1)}p_{\\sigma(2)}\\cdots p_{\\sigma(n)}.$$\n\nAfter simplification, we find that\n\n$$c_n(TM) = \\frac{(2a)^n}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\frac{1}{\\sigma(1)\\sigma(2)\\cdots\\sigma(n)}.$$\n\nSince the sum is over all permutations in $S_n$, it is equal to the number of derangements (permutations with no fixed points) in $S_n$, which is given by the subfactorial function $!n$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$c_n(TM) = \\frac{(2a)^n}{n!} !n.$$\n\nThis is the $n$th Chern class of $TM$ in terms of $a$ and $n$."
