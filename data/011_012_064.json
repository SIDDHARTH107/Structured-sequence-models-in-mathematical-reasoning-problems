    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nTotal number of students = 30\nNumber of girls = 15\nNumber of athletes = 20\nNumber of girls who are athletes = 8\n\nFirst, we find the number of students who are either girls or athletes (or both). To do this, we add the number of girls and the number of athletes, and then subtract the number of girls who are athletes (since they were counted twice).\n\nNumber of students who are either girls or athletes = (Number of girls) + (Number of athletes) - (Number of girls who are athletes)\n= 15 + 20 - 8\n= 27\n\nNow, we find the number of students who are neither girls nor athletes by subtracting the number of students who are either girls or athletes from the total number of students.\n\nNumber of students who are neither girls nor athletes = (Total number of students) - (Number of students who are either girls or athletes)\n= 30 - 27\n= 3\n\nSo, there are 3 students who are neither girls nor athletes."
