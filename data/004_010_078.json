    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 9, we will integrate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe antiderivative of 2x^3 is (2/4)x^4 = (1/2)x^4.\nThe antiderivative of 5x^2 is (5/3)x^3.\nThe antiderivative of -6x is (-6/2)x^2 = -3x^2.\nThe antiderivative of 9 is 9x.\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 9 is:\n\nF(x) = (1/2)x^4 + (5/3)x^3 - 3x^2 + 9x + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
