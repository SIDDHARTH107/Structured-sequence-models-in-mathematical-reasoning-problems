    "message_1": "A cylindrical wire of radius 0.05 meters carries a current of 2 Amps uniformly distributed over its cross-section. Determine the electric potential, V, at a radial distance of 0.1 meters from the center of the wire. Assume that Laplace's equation holds true.",
    "message_2": "To determine the electric potential at a radial distance of 0.1 meters from the center of the wire, we can use the formula for the electric potential in a cylindrical coordinate system:\n\nV(r) = - (μ₀ * I * ln(r / a)) / (2 * π)\n\nwhere V(r) is the electric potential at a radial distance r, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A), I is the current, and a is the radius of the wire.\n\nGiven the values:\n\nI = 2 A\na = 0.05 m\nr = 0.1 m\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV(0.1) = - (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 2 A * ln(0.1 / 0.05)) / (2 * π)\n\nV(0.1) = - (8π × 10^(-7) T·m * ln(2)) / (2 * π)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nV(0.1) = - (4 × 10^(-7) T·m * ln(2))\n\nV(0.1) ≈ - (2.77 × 10^(-7) V)\n\nThe electric potential at a radial distance of 0.1 meters from the center of the wire is approximately -2.77 × 10^(-7) volts."
