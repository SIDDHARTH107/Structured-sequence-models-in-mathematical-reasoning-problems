    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B, which is the symmetric difference of A and B. This means we need to find the elements that are in A or B, but not in both.\n\nA △ B = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find {1} × B, which is the Cartesian product of the set {1} and B. This means we need to find all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is from {1} and b is from B.\n\n{1} × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ ({1} × B):\n\n(A △ B) △ ({1} × B) = ({1, 3} △ {(1, 2), (1, 3)})\n\nSince the elements in the sets are different types (numbers and ordered pairs), there is no overlap between the sets. Therefore, the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n\n(A △ B) △ ({1} × B) = {1, 3, (1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nNext, let's find B △ ({1} × B):\n\nB △ ({1} × B) = ({2, 3} △ {(1, 2), (1, 3)})\n\nAgain, there is no overlap between the sets, so the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n\nB △ ({1} × B) = {2, 3, (1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find A △ (B △ ({1} × B)):\n\nA △ (B △ ({1} × B)) = ({1, 2} △ {2, 3, (1, 2), (1, 3)})\n\nIn this case, there is an overlap between the sets (the element 2). The symmetric difference will include all elements that are in either set, but not in both:\n\nA △ (B △ ({1} × B)) = {1, 3, (1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two results:\n\n(A △ B) △ ({1} × B) = {1, 3, (1, 2), (1, 3)}\nA △ (B △ ({1} × B)) = {1, 3, (1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nThe results are equal, contrary to the initial claim."
