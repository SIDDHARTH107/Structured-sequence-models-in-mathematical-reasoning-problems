    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a polynomial function, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = 3x³ + 10x² - 16x - 16\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it can be challenging to solve analytically. We can try to factor the equation or use numerical methods to find the roots. Let's first try factoring by grouping:\n\n0 = x²(3x + 10) - 16(1x + 1)\n\nNow, we can see that both terms have a common factor of (x + 1):\n\n0 = (x + 1)(3x² + 10x - 16)\n\nNow we are left with a quadratic equation (3x² + 10x - 16) that we need to solve. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 10, and c = -16:\n\nx = (-10 ± √(10² - 4 * 3 * -16)) / (2 * 3)\n\nx = (-10 ± √(100 + 192)) / 6\n\nx = (-10 ± √292) / 6\n\nThe two solutions for x from the quadratic equation are:\n\nx₁ = (-10 + √292) / 6\nx₂ = (-10 - √292) / 6\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the polynomial function are:\n\nx = -1 (from the factor x + 1)\nx = (-10 + √292) / 6\nx = (-10 - √292) / 6"
