    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation $\\sqrt{x+7} = 3$, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n$(\\sqrt{x+7})^2 = 3^2$\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\n$x+7 = 9$\n\nNext, isolate the variable x by subtracting 7 from both sides:\n\n$x = 9 - 7$\n\nFinally, simplify to find the solution:\n\n$x = 2$\n\nSo, the solution to the radical equation $\\sqrt{x+7} = 3$ is $x = 2$."
