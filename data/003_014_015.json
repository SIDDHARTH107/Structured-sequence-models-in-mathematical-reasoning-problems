    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the given function y = 2sin(3x - pi/4), we will analyze the function based on its general form:\n\ny = A sin(Bx - C)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C determines the phase shift.\n\n1. Amplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 2. So, the amplitude is 2.\n\n2. Period:\nThe period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nIn this case, B = 3. So, the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\n3. Phase Shift:\nThe phase shift is determined by the value of C in the general form. In this case, C = pi/4. To find the phase shift, we use the formula:\n\nPhase Shift = C / B\n\nPhase Shift = (pi/4) / 3\n\nSo, the phase shift is (pi/12) to the right (since it's positive).\n\nIn summary, the function y = 2sin(3x - pi/4) has an amplitude of 2, a period of (2π) / 3, and a phase shift of (pi/12) to the right."
