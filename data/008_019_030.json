    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can treat the real and imaginary parts separately. Let's rewrite the given equations:\n\n3x - 5yi = 2 + i  =>  3x - 5y = 2 (real part) and -5y = 1 (imaginary part)\n\n5x + 3yi = 7 - 2i  =>  5x + 3y = 7 (real part) and 3y = -2 (imaginary part)\n\nNow, we have two systems of linear equations with real coefficients:\n\nSystem 1 (real parts):\n3x - 5y = 2\n5x + 3y = 7\n\nSystem 2 (imaginary parts):\n-5y = 1\n3y = -2\n\nLet's solve System 2 first:\n\n-5y = 1 => y = -1/5\n\n3y = -2 => y = -2/3\n\nSince the two values of y are different, there is no solution for y that satisfies both equations in System 2. Therefore, there is no solution for x and y that satisfies the given system of linear equations with complex coefficients."
