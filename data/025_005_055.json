    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 10x - 4\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n2y = 0 => y = 0\n\n-3x^2 + 10x - 4 = 0\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation for x, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -3, b = 10, and c = -4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (10 ± √(10^2 - 4(-3)(-4))) / 2(-3)\nx = (10 ± √(100 - 48)) / -6\nx = (10 ± √52) / -6\n\nSo, we have two possible x values: x1 = (10 + √52) / -6 and x2 = (10 - √52) / -6.\n\nNow, we can plug these x values back into the original equation to find the corresponding y values:\n\nFor x1:\n0 = y^2 - x1^3 + 5x1^2 - 4x1\ny^2 = x1^3 - 5x1^2 + 4x1\n\nFor x2:\n0 = y^2 - x2^3 + 5x2^2 - 4x2\ny^2 = x2^3 - 5x2^2 + 4x2\n\nSince y = 0, both equations above are satisfied, and we have two singular points:\n\n(x1, 0) = ((10 + √52) / -6, 0)\n(x2, 0) = ((10 - √52) / -6, 0)\n\nThus, there are two singular points on the curve, and they are both ordinary double points (nodes) since the partial derivatives are linearly independent."
