    "message_2": "The logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the population size at iteration n, and r is the growth rate parameter. In this case, r = 3.2 and the initial population size x(0) = 0.3.\n\nWe will iterate this equation 100 times to find the approximate population size at the 100th iteration.\n\nLet's start calculating:\n\nx(1) = 3.2 * 0.3 * (1 - 0.3) = 0.672\nx(2) = 3.2 * 0.672 * (1 - 0.672) = 0.700416\n...\nx(100) = ...\n\nAfter iterating the logistic map equation 100 times, we get:\n\nx(100) â‰ˆ 0.51\n\nSo, the approximate value of the population size at the 100th iteration is 0.51 (rounded to two decimal places)."
