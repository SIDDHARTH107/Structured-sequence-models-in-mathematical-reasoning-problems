    "message_1": "Consider a Public Goods Game where four individuals are given the option to contribute money to a common pool. The total amount contributed will be multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and divided equally among the individuals. Each individual has a choice to contribute $10, $20 or $30. If everyone contributes the same amount, then they will receive a total reward of $60 each. However, if one or more individuals decide not to contribute, then the total reward will decrease accordingly. \n\nAssuming that each individual is rational and seeks to maximize their own payoff, what is the best amount that each individual should contribute in order to maximize their own payout?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible outcomes for each individual based on their contribution and the total contribution to the common pool.\n\nCase 1: All individuals contribute $10 each.\nTotal contribution to the pool: $10 * 4 = $40\nTotal reward: $40 * 1.5 = $60\nReward per individual: $60 / 4 = $15\nNet gain per individual: $15 - $10 = $5\n\nCase 2: All individuals contribute $20 each.\nTotal contribution to the pool: $20 * 4 = $80\nTotal reward: $80 * 1.5 = $120\nReward per individual: $120 / 4 = $30\nNet gain per individual: $30 - $20 = $10\n\nCase 3: All individuals contribute $30 each.\nTotal contribution to the pool: $30 * 4 = $120\nTotal reward: $120 * 1.5 = $180\nReward per individual: $180 / 4 = $45\nNet gain per individual: $45 - $30 = $15\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of one or more individuals deciding not to contribute.\n\nCase 4: Three individuals contribute $30 each, and one individual contributes $0.\nTotal contribution to the pool: ($30 * 3) + $0 = $90\nTotal reward: $90 * 1.5 = $135\nReward per individual (for those who contributed): $135 / 4 = $33.75\nNet gain per individual (for those who contributed): $33.75 - $30 = $3.75\nReward for the individual who did not contribute: $33.75\nNet gain for the individual who did not contribute: $33.75 - $0 = $33.75\n\nIn this case, the individual who did not contribute has a higher net gain than those who contributed. This creates an incentive for each individual to not contribute, hoping that others will contribute and they can benefit from the common pool without contributing themselves.\n\nHowever, if all individuals act rationally and decide not to contribute, the total contribution to the pool will be $0, and the reward per individual will also be $0.\n\nIn conclusion, the best amount for each individual to contribute in order to maximize their own payout depends on the behavior of the other individuals. If everyone contributes the same amount, contributing $30 each would result in the highest net gain per individual ($15). However, if one or more individuals decide not to contribute, the best strategy for each individual would be to not contribute as well, since the net gain for those who do not contribute is higher than for those who do. This situation is known as the \"free-rider problem\" in public goods games."
