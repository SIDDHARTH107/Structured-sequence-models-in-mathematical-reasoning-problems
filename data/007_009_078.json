    "message_2": "Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). To compute φ(n), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 48. The prime factors of 48 are 2 and 3, with 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we can plug these prime factors into the formula:\n\nφ(48) = 48 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(48) = 48 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(48) = 24 * (2/3)\nφ(48) = 16\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function φ(48) is 16."
