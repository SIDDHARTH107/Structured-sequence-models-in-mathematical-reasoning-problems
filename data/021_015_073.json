    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle.\n3. Update the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) positions.\n4. Update the velocities and positions of the particles.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the specified number of iterations.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I cannot perform iterative calculations or run simulations. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the exact optimal solution for this problem using PSO. \n\nHowever, I can help you find the optimal solution analytically. The given function is a quadratic function, and its maximum value can be found by completing the square or by finding the vertex of the parabola.\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5\n\nTo find the vertex, we can use the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1 and b = -6.\n\nx_vertex = -(-6) / (2 * 1) = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nNow, we can find the maximum value of the function by plugging x_vertex into the function:\n\nf(3) = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5 = -4\n\nSo, the optimal solution for this optimization problem is x = 3, and the maximum value of the function is f(x) = -4."
