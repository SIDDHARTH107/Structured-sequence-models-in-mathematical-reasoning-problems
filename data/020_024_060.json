    "message_1": "A company is producing a product with a production cost of $50 per unit. The company sells the product for $80 in the market. The company manager wants to increase the sales by offering a discount to customers. Suppose the demand function for the product is:\n\n    Q = 500 - 8P\n\nwhere Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. What is the optimal price for the product that maximizes the company's revenue?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price that maximizes the company's revenue, we need to find the price at which the revenue is maximized. Revenue (R) is the product of price (P) and quantity (Q):\n\nR = P * Q\n\nWe are given the demand function:\n\nQ = 500 - 8P\n\nWe can substitute the demand function into the revenue equation:\n\nR = P * (500 - 8P)\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum revenue by taking the derivative of the revenue function with respect to P and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndR/dP = 500 - 16P = 0\n\nSolving for P:\n\n16P = 500\nP = 500 / 16\nP = 31.25\n\nSo, the optimal price for the product that maximizes the company's revenue is $31.25."
