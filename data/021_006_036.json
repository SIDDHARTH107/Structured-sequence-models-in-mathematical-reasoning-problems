    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we will first discretize the domain and then apply the method to obtain the numerical solution. Since the problem involves time, we will also need to discretize the time interval.\n\n1. Discretize the domain:\nWe are given a square mesh with edge length h = 1/10. This means that there will be 10 equally spaced points along the x-axis and 10 equally spaced points along the y-axis. The total number of nodes in the mesh will be 11x11 = 121.\n\n2. Discretize the time interval:\nLet's use a time step Δt = 1/10, which means we will have 10 equally spaced time steps from t=0 to t=1.\n\n3. Apply the finite element method:\nWe will use the Galerkin method with piecewise linear basis functions to approximate the solution. We will also use the implicit Euler method for time discretization. This will result in a system of linear equations that can be solved for the unknowns at each time step.\n\n4. Calculate the numerical solution at the given points:\nTo find the numerical solution at the points (0.25, 0.2), (0.5, 0.5), and (0.75, 0.8), we will interpolate the solution from the surrounding nodes in the mesh.\n\n5. Compare with the actual solution:\nThe actual solution of the given PDE can be found using separation of variables and Fourier series. The solution is given by:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑ A_mn * sin(m * pi * x) * sin(n * pi * y) * exp(-(m^2 + n^2) * pi^2 * t)\n\nwhere A_mn are the coefficients that can be found using the initial condition.\n\nNow, let's calculate the actual solution at the given points and compare it with the numerical solution obtained using the FEM.\n\nIt's important to note that providing the exact numerical values for the FEM solution and the actual solution requires implementing the FEM in a programming language and solving the system of linear equations. However, the steps provided above outline the process to obtain the numerical solution using the finite element method and compare it with the actual solution."
