    "message_1": "A group of 100 people were followed prospectively for a period of 5 years to study their survival. Among them, 40 people died during the study period. Using survival analysis, calculate the cumulative survival probability at the end of 3 years for this group.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the cumulative survival probability at the end of 3 years, we need to know the number of people who died during each year of the study. Let's assume the number of deaths in each year is as follows:\n\nYear 1: 10 deaths\nYear 2: 15 deaths\nYear 3: 10 deaths\nYear 4: 5 deaths\n\nNow, we can calculate the survival probability for each year:\n\nYear 1 survival probability = (100 - 10) / 100 = 90 / 100 = 0.9\nYear 2 survival probability = (90 - 15) / 90 = 75 / 90 = 0.8333\nYear 3 survival probability = (75 - 10) / 75 = 65 / 75 = 0.8667\n\nTo find the cumulative survival probability at the end of 3 years, we multiply the survival probabilities for each year:\n\nCumulative survival probability at the end of 3 years = 0.9 * 0.8333 * 0.8667 â‰ˆ 0.646\n\nSo, the cumulative survival probability at the end of 3 years for this group is approximately 64.6%."
