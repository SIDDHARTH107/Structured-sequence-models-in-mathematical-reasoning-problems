    "message_1": "A company is planning to produce two types of products P1 and P2. Each product requires two types of raw materials R1 and R2. Given the limited availability of raw materials, the company cannot produce more than 800 units of P1 and 700 units of P2. Also, each unit of P1 requires 6 units of R1 and 8 units of R2, and each unit of P2 requires 8 units of R1 and 5 units of R2. If the company earns a profit of $10 on each unit of P1 and $12 on each unit of P2, determine the maximum profit the company can earn by utilizing robust optimization techniques.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum profit the company can earn, we can set up a linear programming problem. Let x1 be the number of units of P1 produced and x2 be the number of units of P2 produced. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nObjective function: Z = 10x1 + 12x2\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Limited availability of raw materials:\nx1 <= 800 (cannot produce more than 800 units of P1)\nx2 <= 700 (cannot produce more than 700 units of P2)\n\n2. Raw material requirements:\n6x1 + 8x2 <= R1 (total R1 used)\n8x1 + 5x2 <= R2 (total R2 used)\n\n3. Non-negativity constraints:\nx1 >= 0\nx2 >= 0\n\nNow, we need to find the values of R1 and R2. To do this, we can use the maximum production limits for P1 and P2:\n\n6(800) + 8(700) = 4800 + 5600 = 10400 (maximum R1 required)\n8(800) + 5(700) = 6400 + 3500 = 9900 (maximum R2 required)\n\nSo, the constraints become:\n\n6x1 + 8x2 <= 10400\n8x1 + 5x2 <= 9900\n\nNow we can solve the linear programming problem using the simplex method or graphical method. In this case, we'll use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x1 <= 800: Vertical line at x1 = 800\n2. x2 <= 700: Horizontal line at x2 = 700\n3. 6x1 + 8x2 <= 10400: Intersection points at (0, 1300), (800, 700), and (1733.33, 0)\n4. 8x1 + 5x2 <= 9900: Intersection points at (0, 1980), (800, 700), and (1237.5, 0)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (800, 0), (800, 700), and (0, 1300).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function Z = 10x1 + 12x2 at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 0): Z = 10(0) + 12(0) = 0\n2. (800, 0): Z = 10(800) + 12(0) = 8000\n3. (800, 700): Z = 10(800) + 12(700) = 8000 + 8400 = 16400\n4. (0, 1300): Z = 10(0) + 12(1300) = 15600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (800, 700), with a profit of $16,400. Therefore, the company should produce 800 units of P1 and 700 units of P2 to maximize their profit."
