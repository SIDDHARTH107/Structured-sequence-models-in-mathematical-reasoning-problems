    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a Rail fence cipher with a rail key of 3, we arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the letters row by row to get the ciphertext:\n\nHORELWLDOLO\n\nSo, the ciphertext generated by the Rail fence cipher for the given plain text message is \"HORELWLDOLO\"."
