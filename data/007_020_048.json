    "message_1": "Suppose you want to establish a RSA encryption system where your public key is (923, 29) and private key is (923, 401). If someone sends you an encrypted message \"1725\", what would be the original message sent?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using RSA, we need to use the private key (n, d) = (923, 401). The decryption process involves the following formula:\n\nDecrypted message = (Encrypted message ^ d) mod n\n\nIn this case, the encrypted message is 1725, d is 401, and n is 923. So, we need to calculate:\n\nDecrypted message = (1725 ^ 401) mod 923\n\nUsing a calculator or programming language, we find:\n\nDecrypted message = 218\n\nSo, the original message sent is 218."
