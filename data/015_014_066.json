    "message_1": "A mathematical model predicts that the temperature of a certain region will follow a chaotic behavior with an average temperature of 25°C and a standard deviation of 5°C. A weather station records the temperature of the region at noon for 30 consecutive days. Calculate the probability that on any given day the temperature recorded by the weather station will be within one standard deviation from the mean predicted by the model.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that the temperature recorded by the weather station will be within one standard deviation from the mean predicted by the model, we can use the empirical rule for normal distributions. The empirical rule states that for a normal distribution:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n- Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.\n- Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nSince we are interested in the probability that the temperature is within one standard deviation from the mean, we can use the first part of the empirical rule. Therefore, the probability that the temperature recorded by the weather station will be within one standard deviation from the mean predicted by the model is approximately 68%."
