    "message_1": "A math student wants to study the relationship between the number of hours spent studying and the grade received in a particular course. After collecting data from 20 students, the math student calculates a correlation coefficient of r=0.72. \n\nWhat is the coefficient of determination (r²)?",
    "message_2": "The coefficient of determination (r²) is the square of the correlation coefficient (r). In this case, r = 0.72.\n\nTo calculate r², simply square the value of r:\n\nr² = (0.72)² = 0.5184\n\nThe coefficient of determination (r²) is 0.5184."
