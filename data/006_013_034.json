    "message_2": "To find the probability of a hurricane hitting the specific coastal town in Florida in any given year, we can use the historical data provided.\n\nHistorically, hurricanes have hit the town 2 times in 20 years. So, the probability of a hurricane hitting the town in any given year can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability = (Number of times a hurricane hit the town) / (Total number of years)\n\nProbability = 2 / 20\n\nProbability = 1 / 10\n\nTherefore, the probability of a hurricane hitting the specific coastal town in Florida in any given year is 1/10 or 0.1, which is equivalent to 10%."
