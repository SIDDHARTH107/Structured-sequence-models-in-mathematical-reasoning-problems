    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can tell you that the problem you're asking about is related to knot theory, a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of knots and their variations. In knot theory, knots are classified by their minimal crossing number, which is the smallest number of crossings in any diagram of the knot.\n\nFor a knot with exactly 6 crossings, you are referring to 6-crossing knots. According to the knot tables, there are 3 prime knots with 6 crossings, which are 6_1, 6_2, and 6_3. Prime knots are knots that cannot be formed by joining two simpler knots.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there may be multiple distinct ways to tie each of these prime knots, depending on how the crossings are arranged. Determining the exact number of distinct ways to tie each prime knot is a complex problem that depends on the specific knot and the method used to tie it.\n\nIn summary, there are 3 prime knots with exactly 6 crossings, but the number of distinct ways to tie each of these knots may vary."
