    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using the firefly algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the firefly population.\n2. Define the attractiveness function.\n3. Define the movement of fireflies.\n4. Update the positions of fireflies.\n5. Evaluate the fitness of each firefly.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the maximum number of iterations.\n7. Find the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x.\n\nLet's begin:\n\n1. Initialize the firefly population:\nWe will generate 10 random initial positions for the fireflies in the search space. Let's assume the search space is between -10 and 10.\n\n2. Define the attractiveness function:\nThe attractiveness function is defined as:\nβ = β0 * exp(-γ * r^2)\n\nwhere β0 is the initial attractiveness, γ is the light absorption coefficient, and r is the distance between two fireflies.\n\n3. Define the movement of fireflies:\nThe movement of a firefly i towards a more attractive firefly j is defined as:\nx_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + β * (x_j(t) - x_i(t)) + α * (rand - 0.5)\n\nwhere α is a randomization parameter, rand is a random number between 0 and 1, and t is the current iteration.\n\n4. Update the positions of fireflies:\nFor each firefly i, find the most attractive firefly j, and update the position of firefly i using the movement equation.\n\n5. Evaluate the fitness of each firefly:\nCalculate the value of f(x) for each firefly position x.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the maximum number of iterations (50 in this case).\n\n7. Find the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x:\nAfter completing the iterations, find the firefly with the minimum f(x) value and its corresponding position x.\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the firefly algorithm requires programming and numerical computations. The above explanation provides a conceptual understanding of the steps involved in the algorithm. To find the actual minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x, you would need to implement the algorithm in a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or any other suitable language."
