    "message_1": "A museum has a collection of 20 paintings, but only has space to display 5 at a time. In how many ways can the museum choose which paintings to display if each painting must be displayed exactly once?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways the museum can choose which paintings to display, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of paintings (20) and k is the number of paintings to be displayed at a time (5).\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!(20-5)!)\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!15!)\n\nC(20, 5) = (20*19*18*17*16) / (5*4*3*2*1)\n\nC(20, 5) = 15504\n\nSo, there are 15,504 different ways the museum can choose which paintings to display if each painting must be displayed exactly once."
