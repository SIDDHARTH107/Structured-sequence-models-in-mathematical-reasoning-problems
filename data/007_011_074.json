    "message_2": "A quadratic residue is an integer that is congruent to a perfect square modulo a given modulus. In this case, we are looking for quadratic residues modulo 11.\n\nTo find all quadratic residues of 11, we can calculate the squares of the integers from 1 to (11-1)/2, which is 1 to 5, and then reduce them modulo 11.\n\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n4^2 ≡ 16 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues of 11 are {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}."
