    "message_2": "An orthogonal array with 5 factors and 2 levels per factor is represented as L(2^(5-1)), which simplifies to L(2^4) or L(16). In this array, there are 16 runs (rows) and 5 factors (columns).\n\nSince there are 2 levels per factor, each factor can take one of two values (let's say 0 or 1). To find the number of unique configurations, we can calculate the total possible combinations of these levels for all 5 factors.\n\nThe number of unique configurations is given by the formula:\n\nConfigurations = (Levels per factor)^(Number of factors)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nConfigurations = (2)^5 = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 unique configurations possible in a 2^(5-1) orthogonal array with 5 factors and 2 levels per factor."
