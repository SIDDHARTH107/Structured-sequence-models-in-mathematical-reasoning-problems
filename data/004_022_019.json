    "message_1": "A farmer has a plot of land that measures 24m by 36m. The farmer wants to fence off a rectangular section of the plot and build a small pond outside the fence with the remaining land. \nWhat is the largest possible area of the enclosed rectangular section if the total fencing material available is 120 meters?",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the enclosed rectangular section be x and y meters. The perimeter of the enclosed section is given by the formula P = 2x + 2y. We know that the total fencing material available is 120 meters, so:\n\n2x + 2y = 120\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + y = 60\n\nNow we need to express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 60 - x\n\nThe area of the enclosed rectangular section is given by the formula A = xy. We can substitute the expression for y in terms of x:\n\nA = x(60 - x)\n\nA = 60x - x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area function with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = 60 - 2x = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 60\nx = 30\n\nNow we can find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 60 - x\ny = 60 - 30\ny = 30\n\nSo the dimensions of the largest possible enclosed rectangular section are 30m by 30m, and the largest possible area is:\n\nA = 30 * 30 = 900 square meters."
