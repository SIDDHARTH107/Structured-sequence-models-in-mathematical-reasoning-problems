    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To calculate the surface area, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe area of one face (a square) is found by multiplying the length by the width. Since the length and width are both 4 cm, the area of one face is:\n\n4 cm × 4 cm = 16 square centimeters\n\nNow, multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area:\n\n16 square centimeters × 6 = 96 square centimeters\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 96 square centimeters."
