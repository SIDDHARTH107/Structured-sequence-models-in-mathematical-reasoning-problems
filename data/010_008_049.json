    "message_2": "A simplicial complex with 6 vertices can have at most 6 choose 3 = 20 faces (triangles). However, we need to consider the number of edges given, which is 10. Let's use Euler's formula for planar graphs to find the number of faces:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. In this case, V = 6 and E = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n6 - 10 + F = 2\n\nSolving for F, we get:\n\nF = 6\n\nSo, this simplicial complex has 6 faces."
