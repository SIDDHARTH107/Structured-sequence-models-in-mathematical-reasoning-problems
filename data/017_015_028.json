    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 24, and let there be 20 elements of order 3 in G. Since the order of an element divides the order of the group, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. We know there is exactly one element of order 1, which is the identity element. \n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow theorems. The number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1 and 3. If there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, it must be of order 8, and thus G would have a normal subgroup of order 8. In this case, G would be a semi-direct product of a group of order 8 and a group of order 3, which would give us a non-abelian group. However, this does not match the given condition of 20 elements of order 3.\n\nSo, there must be three 2-Sylow subgroups, each of order 8. Since each of these subgroups has 7 non-identity elements, and they intersect only at the identity element, there are a total of 3 * 7 = 21 non-identity elements in these subgroups. However, this contradicts the given condition of 20 elements of order 3, so this case is not possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the 3-Sylow subgroups. The number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is 1, so there is a unique (and thus normal) 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3. Let H be this subgroup. Since there are 20 elements of order 3 in G, and H has two non-identity elements of order 3, there must be 10 subgroups of G that are isomorphic to H. Each of these subgroups has 2 non-identity elements, and they intersect only at the identity element, so there are a total of 10 * 2 = 20 non-identity elements of order 3 in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of order 2. Since G has 24 elements, and we have accounted for 1 identity element and 20 elements of order 3, there must be 24 - 1 - 20 = 3 elements of order 2 in G. Let K be a subgroup of G generated by an element of order 2. Then, K is a normal subgroup of G, since it has index 2.\n\nNow, we have a normal subgroup K of order 2 and a normal subgroup H of order 3. Since the orders of K and H are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., K ∩ H = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, the product of K and H, denoted by KH, has order 2 * 3 = 6. By the second isomorphism theorem, we have G/KH ≅ (K ∩ H)/H, which implies that G/KH is a trivial group. Thus, G ≅ KH, and G is a semi-direct product of K and H.\n\nSince K is a group of order 2 and H is a group of order 3, both K and H are cyclic. Let k be a generator of K and h be a generator of H. Then, G is generated by k and h, and the relations between k and h are determined by the action of K on H by conjugation. Since K is a normal subgroup, this action is well-defined, and we have:\n\nkhk^(-1) = h^x,\n\nwhere x is an integer. Since k^2 = e, we have:\n\nh = kh^2k^(-1) = (khk^(-1))^2 = h^(x^2).\n\nThus, x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3), which implies that x ≡ ±1 (mod 3). If x ≡ 1 (mod 3), then G is abelian, which contradicts the given condition of 20 elements of order 3. Therefore, x ≡ -1 (mod 3), and G is non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, G is a non-abelian group of order 24, generated by elements k and h with orders 2 and 3, respectively, and the relation khk^(-1) = h^(-1). This group is isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24."
