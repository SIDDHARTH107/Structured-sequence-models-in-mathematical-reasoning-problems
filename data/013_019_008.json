    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players, A and B, who are going to play a game. Player A knows the secret code to win, but if player B figures out the code, player A will lose. Player A can send a message to player B, but it might be a lie. Player B must guess the secret code after hearing player A's message. What is the probability that player B will guess the secret code correctly if player A sends a truthful message 60% of the time and a lie 40% of the time?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that player B will guess the secret code correctly, we need to know the total number of possible secret codes. Let's assume there are N possible secret codes.\n\nIf player A sends a truthful message, player B will guess the secret code correctly with a probability of 1 (since player A is telling the truth). If player A sends a lie, player B will guess the secret code correctly with a probability of 1/(N-1) (since player A is lying, and there are N-1 other possible secret codes).\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Total Probability to find the probability that player B will guess the secret code correctly:\n\nP(correct guess) = P(correct guess | truthful message) * P(truthful message) + P(correct guess | lie) * P(lie)\n\nP(correct guess) = (1) * (0.6) + (1/(N-1)) * (0.4)\n\nP(correct guess) = 0.6 + 0.4/(N-1)\n\nWithout knowing the value of N (the total number of possible secret codes), we cannot provide a specific probability. However, this formula gives the probability that player B will guess the secret code correctly based on the given information."
