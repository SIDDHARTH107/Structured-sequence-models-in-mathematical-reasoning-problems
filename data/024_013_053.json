    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to find the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for this metric is given by:\n\n$$g = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe determinant of this metric tensor is:\n\n$$\\det(g) = 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 9 = 144$$\n\nNow, the volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume form in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, which is $dV = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. Therefore, the volume form for this metric is:\n\n$$dV = \\sqrt{144} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = 12 \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$$"
