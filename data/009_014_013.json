    "message_2": "To determine the population of rabbits in 2022 using a logistic growth model, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r * t))\n\nWhere:\nP(t) = population at time t\nK = carrying capacity (2000 rabbits)\nP0 = initial population (500 rabbits)\nr = annual growth rate (0.1 or 10%)\nt = time in years (2022 - 2010 = 12 years)\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(12) = 2000 / (1 + (2000 - 500) / 500 * e^(-0.1 * 12))\n\nP(12) = 2000 / (1 + 1500 / 500 * e^(-1.2))\n\nP(12) = 2000 / (1 + 3 * e^(-1.2))\n\nNow, we can calculate e^(-1.2) ≈ 0.301\n\nP(12) = 2000 / (1 + 3 * 0.301)\n\nP(12) = 2000 / (1 + 0.903)\n\nP(12) = 2000 / 1.903\n\nFinally, we get the population of rabbits in 2022:\n\nP(12) ≈ 1051 rabbits\n\nSo, the population of rabbits in 2022 is estimated to be approximately 1051 rabbits."
