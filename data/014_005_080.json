    "message_1": "Alice wants to send a digital message to Bob, but wants to ensure that the message has not been altered during transmission. She decides to use digital signatures. The message is 1000 bits long and Alice's private key is a 256-bit prime number. If Alice uses RSA algorithm to generate the digital signature, what will be the size of the signature?",
    "message_2": "In the RSA algorithm, the size of the digital signature is determined by the size of the key used for signing. Since Alice's private key is a 256-bit prime number, the digital signature generated using the RSA algorithm will also be 256 bits in size."
