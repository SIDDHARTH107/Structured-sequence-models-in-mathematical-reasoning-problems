    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the x variable by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation. We can also eliminate the x variable by multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the third equation.\n\n1) Multiply the first equation by 2:\n4x + 6y - 2z = 10\n\n2) Subtract the first modified equation from the second equation:\n(4x + 2y + 2z) - (4x + 6y - 2z) = 4 - 10\n-4y + 4z = -6\n\n3) Divide the new equation by -2:\n2y - 2z = 3\n\n4) Multiply the first equation by 3:\n6x + 9y - 3z = 15\n\n5) Subtract the first modified equation from the third equation:\n(6x - y + 5z) - (6x + 9y - 3z) = 14 - 15\n-10y + 8z = -1\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n2y - 2z = 3\n-10y + 8z = -1\n\n6) Multiply the first equation by 5 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n10y - 10z = 15\n\n7) Add the second equation to the modified first equation:\n(10y - 10z) + (-10y + 8z) = 15 + (-1)\n-2z = 14\n\n8) Divide by -2:\nz = -7\n\n9) Substitute the value of z back into the first equation with two variables:\n2y - 2(-7) = 3\n2y + 14 = 3\n\n10) Subtract 14 from both sides:\n2y = -11\n\n11) Divide by 2:\ny = -11/2\n\n12) Substitute the values of y and z back into the original first equation:\n2x + 3(-11/2) - (-7) = 5\n\n13) Simplify the equation:\n2x - 33/2 + 7 = 5\n\n14) Add 33/2 to both sides:\n2x = 5 - 7 + 33/2\n2x = -2 + 33/2\n2x = 29/2\n\n15) Divide by 2:\nx = 29/4\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the given system of equations are:\n\nx = 29/4\ny = -11/2\nz = -7"
