Assume that the initial temperature distribution is given by $u(z,0) = \\Re(z)$, where $\\Re(z)$ denotes the real part of $z$. Find the temperature distribution $u(z,t)$ for $t > 0$ and $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$, subject to the boundary condition that $u(z,t) = 0$ for $z \\in \\partial \\mathbb{D}$ and $t > 0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation on the unit disk with the given initial and boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables and expand the solution in terms of the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in polar coordinates.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the heat equation in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $z = r e^{i\\theta}$:\n\n$$u_t = \\Delta u = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(r \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\theta^2}.$$\n\nNow, let's assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of $r$ and $\\theta$ and time, i.e., $u(r, \\theta, t) = R(r) \\Theta(\\theta) T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$R(r) \\Theta(\\theta) T'(t) = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{d r} \\left(r \\frac{d}{d r} (R(r) \\Theta(\\theta))\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d^2}{d \\theta^2} (R(r) \\Theta(\\theta)) T(t).$$\n\nDividing both sides by $R(r) \\Theta(\\theta) T(t)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{d r} \\left(r \\frac{d R(r)}{d r}\\right) \\frac{1}{R(r)} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d^2 \\Theta(\\theta)}{d \\theta^2} \\frac{1}{\\Theta(\\theta)}.$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $r$ and $\\theta$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will denote by $-\\lambda$. Thus, we have two equations:\n\n1. $T'(t) = -\\lambda T(t)$,\n2. $\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{d r} \\left(r \\frac{d R(r)}{d r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d^2 \\Theta(\\theta)}{d \\theta^2} = -\\lambda$.\n\nThe first equation is a simple first-order ODE for $T(t)$, which has the solution $T(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$.\n\nThe second equation can be separated further into two ODEs for $R(r)$ and $\\Theta(\\theta)$:\n\n1. $\\frac{d^2 \\Theta(\\theta)}{d \\theta^2} = -m^2 \\Theta(\\theta)$, where $m^2 = -\\lambda r^2$,\n2. $\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{d r} \\left(r \\frac{d R(r)}{d r}\\right) - m^2 R(r) = 0$.\n\nThe first equation is a simple second-order ODE for $\\Theta(\\theta)$, which has the solution $\\Theta(\\theta) = A \\cos(m \\theta) + B \\sin(m \\theta)$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nThe second equation is a Bessel's equation of order $m$ for $R(r)$. The solution to this equation is given by $R(r) = C J_m(mr) + D Y_m(mr)$, where $C$ and $D$ are constants, and $J_m$ and $Y_m$ are Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively.\n\nHowever, since $Y_m(mr)$ is singular at $r=0$, we must set $D=0$. Thus, the solution for $R(r)$ is given by $R(r) = C J_m(mr)$.\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the boundary condition $u(z,t) = 0$ for $z \\in \\partial \\mathbb{D}$ and $t > 0$. This implies that $R(1) \\Theta(\\theta) = 0$. Since $\\Theta(\\theta)$ cannot be identically zero, we must have $R(1) = C J_m(m) = 0$. This means that $m$ must be a zero of the Bessel function $J_m$.\n\nLet $m_n$ be the $n$-th zero of the Bessel function $J_m$. Then, the solution to the heat equation can be written as:\n\n$$u(r, \\theta, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} e^{-\\lambda_n t} R_n(r) \\Theta_n(\\theta),$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_n = m_n^2$, $R_n(r) = J_m(m_n r)$, and $\\Theta_n(\\theta) = A_n \\cos(m_n \\theta) + B_n \\sin(m_n \\theta)$.\n\nFinally, we need to satisfy the initial condition $u(r, \\theta, 0) = \\Re(r e^{i\\theta}) = r \\cos(\\theta)$. To do this, we can use the orthogonality properties of the Bessel functions and trigonometric functions to find the coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$:\n\n$$r \\cos(\\theta) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} R_n(r) \\Theta_n(\\theta).$$\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of $\\cos(\\theta)$ and $\\sin(\\theta)$ on both sides, we can determine the coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$. In this case, we have:\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{\\int_0^1 r \\cos(\\theta) R_n(r) dr}{\\int_0^1 R_n^2(r) dr}, \\quad B_n = 0.$$\n\nThus, the temperature distribution $u(z,t)$ for $t > 0$ and $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$ is given by:\n\n$$u(r, \\theta, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} e^{-\\lambda_n t} R_n(r) A_n \\cos(m_n \\theta).$$"
