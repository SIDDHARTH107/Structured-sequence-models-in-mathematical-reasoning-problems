    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, the crime occurring exactly 3 times)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 20 incidents)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 3 crimes)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.2)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 1 - 0.2 = 0.8)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(20, 3), which is the number of combinations of 20 incidents taken 3 at a time:\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3! * (20-3)!)\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3! * 17!)\nC(20, 3) = (20 * 19 * 18 * 17!)/(3! * 17!)\nC(20, 3) = (20 * 19 * 18)/(3 * 2 * 1)\nC(20, 3) = 1140\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(20, 3) * 0.2^3 * 0.8^(20-3)\nP(X = 3) = 1140 * 0.2^3 * 0.8^17\nP(X = 3) = 1140 * 0.008 * 0.0223 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.2035 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nSo, the probability that this crime will occur exactly 3 times in a randomly selected sample of 20 incidents in the neighborhood is approximately 0.2035 or 20.35%."
