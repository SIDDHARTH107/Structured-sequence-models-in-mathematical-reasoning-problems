    "message_1": "What is the Z-score of a data point if the mean is 10 and the standard deviation is 3, and the data point is 16? Is this data point considered an outlier according to the usual criteria of a Z-score greater than 3 (or less than -3)?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Z-score, we use the formula:\n\nZ-score = (data point - mean) / standard deviation\n\nIn this case, the data point is 16, the mean is 10, and the standard deviation is 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nZ-score = (16 - 10) / 3\nZ-score = 6 / 3\nZ-score = 2\n\nThe Z-score of this data point is 2. Since the Z-score is not greater than 3 or less than -3, this data point is not considered an outlier according to the usual criteria."
