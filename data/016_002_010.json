    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a Koch snowflake curve, we need to determine the length of each side after the specified number of iterations and then add those lengths together.\n\nA Koch snowflake is formed by taking an equilateral triangle and adding a smaller equilateral triangle to each side, then repeating the process for the new sides. Each iteration increases the number of sides by a factor of 4 and the length of each side is divided by 3.\n\nLet's find the length of each side after 4 iterations:\n\nInitial side length: 10 cm\nIteration 1: 10 cm / 3 = 3.333 cm\nIteration 2: 3.333 cm / 3 = 1.111 cm\nIteration 3: 1.111 cm / 3 = 0.370 cm\nIteration 4: 0.370 cm / 3 = 0.123 cm\n\nNow, let's find the number of sides after 4 iterations:\n\nInitial number of sides: 3 (equilateral triangle)\nIteration 1: 3 * 4 = 12\nIteration 2: 12 * 4 = 48\nIteration 3: 48 * 4 = 192\nIteration 4: 192 * 4 = 768\n\nFinally, let's find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after 4 iterations:\n\nPerimeter = number of sides * length of each side\nPerimeter = 768 * 0.123 cm = 94.464 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of a Koch snowflake curve whose initial side has a length of 10 cm and iterates through four stages is approximately 94.464 cm."
