    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(3x-2) - √(x-1) = 1, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate one of the square roots.\nAdd √(x-1) to both sides of the equation:\n√(3x-2) = √(x-1) + 1\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation.\n(√(3x-2))^2 = (√(x-1) + 1)^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n3x - 2 = (x-1) + 2√(x-1) + 1\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation.\nCombine like terms on the right side of the equation:\n2x - 1 = 2√(x-1)\n\nStep 4: Isolate the remaining square root.\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2:\nx - 0.5 = √(x-1)\n\nStep 5: Square both sides of the equation again.\n(x - 0.5)^2 = (√(x-1))^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx^2 - x + 0.25 = x - 1\n\nStep 6: Move all terms to one side of the equation.\nx^2 - 2x + 1.25 = 0\n\nStep 7: Solve the quadratic equation.\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 1.25. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(1.25))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 5)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (4 - 5) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. Therefore, the equation √(3x-2) - √(x-1) = 1 has no real solutions."
