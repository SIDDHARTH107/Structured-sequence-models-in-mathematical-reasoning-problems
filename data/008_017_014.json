    "message_2": "First, we need to represent the given system of linear equations as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column matrix of variables [x, y, z], and b is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 4  5  6 |\n    | 7  8  9 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  7  |\n    | 16  |\n    | 23  |\n\nNow, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve the system of linear equations. However, the given matrix A is not a sparse matrix, as it does not have a significant number of zero entries. Sparse matrices are used to save memory and computational time when dealing with large matrices with many zero entries. In this case, we will proceed with Gaussian elimination without using sparse matrices.\n\n1. Subtract the first row multiplied by 4 from the second row, and subtract the first row multiplied by 7 from the third row to eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\nA = | 1  2   3  |\n    | 0 -3  -6  |\n    | 0 -6 -12  |\n\nb = |  7  |\n    |  4  |\n    |  2  |\n\n2. Divide the second row by -3:\n\nA = | 1  2   3  |\n    | 0  1   2  |\n    | 0 -6 -12  |\n\nb = |  7  |\n    | -4/3 |\n    |  2  |\n\n3. Add the second row multiplied by 6 to the third row to eliminate y from the third row:\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 0  1  2 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n\nb = |   7   |\n    | -4/3 |\n    |   0   |\n\nAt this point, we can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true. Therefore, we have an underdetermined system with infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo express the general solution, we can solve the system for x and y in terms of z:\n\nFrom the second row: y + 2z = -4/3\n=> y = -4/3 - 2z\n\nFrom the first row: x + 2(-4/3 - 2z) + 3z = 7\n=> x = 7 - 4 + 4/3 + z\n=> x = 1/3 + z\n\nThe general solution can be expressed as a column matrix in terms of z:\n\nx = |  1/3 + z  |\ny = | -4/3 - 2z |\nz = |     z      |"
