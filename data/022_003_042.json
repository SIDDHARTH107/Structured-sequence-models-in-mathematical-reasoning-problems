    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function f(z) is analytic (holomorphic) on a simply connected domain D and its boundary C, then the contour integral of f(z) over C is equal to zero.\n\nFirst, we need to check if f(z) is analytic on the domain D. The function f(z) = z^4 + 4z^3 - 2z^2 + 3z - 1 is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic on the domain D.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic on the domain D and its boundary C, we can apply Cauchy's theorem:\n\n∮_C f(z) dz = 0\n\nSo, the value of the contour integral ∮_C f(z) dz is 0."
