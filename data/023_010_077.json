    "message_2": "To calculate the two-dimensional Fourier Transform of a digital image with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, we can use the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The FFT algorithm reduces the number of complex multiplications required compared to the direct computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).\n\nFor a one-dimensional FFT, the number of complex multiplications required is N * log2(N), where N is the number of data points. In our case, we have a two-dimensional image, so we need to apply the FFT algorithm separately to each dimension (rows and columns).\n\nFirst, we apply the FFT to the rows:\n640 * log2(640) = 640 * 9.3219 ≈ 5966 complex multiplications per row\n\nSince there are 480 rows, the total number of complex multiplications for the rows is:\n480 * 5966 ≈ 2,863,680\n\nNext, we apply the FFT to the columns:\n480 * log2(480) = 480 * 8.9069 ≈ 4275 complex multiplications per column\n\nSince there are 640 columns, the total number of complex multiplications for the columns is:\n640 * 4275 ≈ 2,736,000\n\nFinally, we add the number of complex multiplications for the rows and columns to get the total number of complex multiplications required to calculate the two-dimensional Fourier Transform of the image:\n\n2,863,680 + 2,736,000 = 5,599,680\n\nTherefore, approximately 5,599,680 complex multiplications are required to calculate the two-dimensional Fourier Transform of a 640 x 480 pixel digital image using the FFT algorithm."
