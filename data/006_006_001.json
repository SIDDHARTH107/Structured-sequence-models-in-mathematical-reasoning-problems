    "message_1": "In a basketball game, a player has a free throw shooting percentage of 85%. What is the probability that the player makes both free throws if given two attempts?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the player makes both free throws, we need to multiply the probability of making each free throw. Since the player has an 85% free throw shooting percentage, the probability of making each free throw is 0.85.\n\nProbability of making both free throws = (Probability of making 1st free throw) × (Probability of making 2nd free throw)\n= 0.85 × 0.85\n= 0.7225\n\nSo, the probability that the player makes both free throws is 72.25%."
