For example, the trefoil knot (a knot with three crossings) is the simplest nontrivial knot, while the unknot (a knot with no crossings) is the trivial knot. The question could be rephrased to ask for the minimum crossing number of a specific knot, such as the figure-eight knot (a knot with four crossings) or the granny knot (a knot with six crossings).",
    "message_2": "In summary, the minimum number of times a closed curve in three-dimensional space has to cross itself to form a nontrivial knot is three crossings, which results in the simplest nontrivial knot known as the trefoil knot."
