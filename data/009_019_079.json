    "message_2": "To find the expected price of the stock after 1 year, we can use the geometric Brownian motion model. The given stochastic differential equation can be written as:\n\ndS/S = 0.05 dt + 0.2 dW\n\nIntegrating both sides from time 0 to time 1 (1 year), we get:\n\nln(S(1)/S(0)) = ∫(0.05 dt) + ∫(0.2 dW)\n\nTaking the expectation of both sides, we have:\n\nE[ln(S(1)/S(0))] = E[∫(0.05 dt)] + E[∫(0.2 dW)]\n\nSince the expectation of the integral of dW is 0, we have:\n\nE[ln(S(1)/S(0))] = E[∫(0.05 dt)]\n\nNow, integrating 0.05 dt from 0 to 1:\n\n∫(0.05 dt) = 0.05 * (1 - 0) = 0.05\n\nSo, E[ln(S(1)/S(0))] = 0.05\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expectation as:\n\nE[S(1)] = S(0) * e^(0.05)\n\nGiven that the initial price of the stock is $100, we have:\n\nE[S(1)] = 100 * e^(0.05)\n\nE[S(1)] ≈ 100 * 1.05127 ≈ $105.13\n\nSo, the expected price of the stock after 1 year is approximately $105.13."
