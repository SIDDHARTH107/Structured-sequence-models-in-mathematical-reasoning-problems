    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting 6 heads and 4 tails in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the total number of trials (coin flips), which is 10\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want, which is 6\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 6) = (10C6) * (0.5^6) * (0.5^4)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 10C6:\n\n10C6 = 10! / (6!(10-6)!)\n      = 10! / (6!4!)\n      = (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((6*5*4*3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n      = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1)\n      = 210\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.5^6) * (0.5^4):\n\n(0.5^6) * (0.5^4) = (0.5^10) = 1/1024 ≈ 0.00097656\n\nFinally, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 6) = 210 * 0.00097656 ≈ 0.205078\n\nSo the probability of getting 6 heads and 4 tails in 10 coin flips is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%."
