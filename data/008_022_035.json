    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we first need to eliminate one of the variables. In this case, we can eliminate y by subtracting the first equation from the second equation.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(1.01x + y) - (x + y) &= 8.1 - 8 \\\\\n1.01x - x &= 0.1 \\\\\n0.01x &= 0.1\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx = \\frac{0.1}{0.01} = 10\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation to find the value of y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y = 8 \\\\\n10 + y = 8\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving for y:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny = 8 - 10 = -2\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 10 and y = -2.\n\nAs for the accuracy of the solution, since we used the elimination method and solved the equations exactly, the solution is accurate. However, it's important to note that if the coefficients of the equations were slightly different or if the equations were solved using a numerical method, the solution could be less accurate due to potential rounding errors or other numerical issues."
