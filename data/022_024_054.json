    "message_2": "To find the temperature at the point $(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ after 3 hours, we need to plug in the values of $x$, $y$, and $t$ into the given function $u(x,y,t) = e^{-t} \\sin(x)\\sin(y)$.\n\nFirst, we need to convert 3 hours into a unit of time that is consistent with the given function. Since the function does not specify a unit of time, we will assume that the time is given in hours. Therefore, $t = 3$.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\n$u(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{3}, 3) = e^{-3} \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4})\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3})$\n\nWe know that $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSo, the temperature at the point $(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ after 3 hours is:\n\n$u(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{3}, 3) = e^{-3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{4}e^{-3}$"
