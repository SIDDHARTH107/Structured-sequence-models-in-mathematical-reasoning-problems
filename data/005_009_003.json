    "message_2": "To find the median, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22\n\nSince there are 12 numbers in the dataset, which is an even number, we need to find the average of the two middle numbers (the 6th and 7th numbers) to find the median.\n\nThe 6th number is 16, and the 7th number is 17. The average of these two numbers is:\n\n(16 + 17) / 2 = 33 / 2 = 16.5\n\nSo, the median of the given dataset is 16.5."
