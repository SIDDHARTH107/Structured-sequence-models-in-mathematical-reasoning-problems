    "message_1": "Consider the metric given by $ds^2 = 4dx^2 + 9dy^2 + 16dz^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Find all the Killing vector fields of this metric.",
    "message_2": "To find the Killing vector fields of the given metric, we need to find vector fields $X = X^i \\partial_i$ that satisfy the Killing's equation:\n\n$$\\nabla_i X_j + \\nabla_j X_i = 0$$\n\nwhere $\\nabla_i$ is the covariant derivative and $X_i = g_{ij} X^j$. The given metric is diagonal, so we have $g_{ij} = \\text{diag}(4, 9, 16)$. Thus, the inverse metric is $g^{ij} = \\text{diag}(1/4, 1/9, 1/16)$.\n\nNow, we compute the Christoffel symbols:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{lj} + \\partial_j g_{li} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal and constant, all the partial derivatives of the metric components vanish, and thus all the Christoffel symbols are zero:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$$\n\nNow, we can compute the covariant derivative of the Killing vector field components:\n\n$$\\nabla_i X_j = \\partial_i X_j - \\Gamma^k_{ij} X_k = \\partial_i X_j$$\n\nThe Killing's equation becomes:\n\n$$\\partial_i X_j + \\partial_j X_i = 0$$\n\nThis equation can be written as a system of six equations for the components of the Killing vector field:\n\n1. $\\partial_x X_x = 0$\n2. $\\partial_y X_x + \\partial_x X_y = 0$\n3. $\\partial_z X_x + \\partial_x X_z = 0$\n4. $\\partial_y X_y = 0$\n5. $\\partial_z X_y + \\partial_y X_z = 0$\n6. $\\partial_z X_z = 0$\n\nFrom equations (1), (4), and (6), we have that $X_x = f(y, z)$, $X_y = g(x, z)$, and $X_z = h(x, y)$, where $f$, $g$, and $h$ are arbitrary functions of their respective arguments.\n\nNow, we can use equations (2), (3), and (5) to find the Killing vector fields:\n\n2. $\\partial_y f + \\partial_x g = 0$\n3. $\\partial_z f + \\partial_x h = 0$\n5. $\\partial_z g + \\partial_y h = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we have $\\partial_y f = -\\partial_x g$, so $f = -\\int \\partial_x g dy + f_1(z)$. Similarly, from equation (3), we have $\\partial_z f = -\\partial_x h$, so $f = -\\int \\partial_x h dz + f_2(y)$. Combining these two expressions for $f$, we get:\n\n$$f = -\\int \\partial_x g dy - \\int \\partial_x h dz + f_3$$\n\nwhere $f_3$ is a constant. This implies that $X_x = -\\int \\partial_x g dy - \\int \\partial_x h dz + f_3$.\n\nSimilarly, we can find expressions for $X_y$ and $X_z$:\n\n$$X_y = -\\int \\partial_y h dx - \\int \\partial_y f dz + g_3$$\n$$X_z = -\\int \\partial_z f dx - \\int \\partial_z g dy + h_3$$\n\nwhere $g_3$ and $h_3$ are constants.\n\nThus, the Killing vector fields are given by:\n\n$$X = \\left(-\\int \\partial_x g dy - \\int \\partial_x h dz + f_3\\right) \\partial_x + \\left(-\\int \\partial_y h dx - \\int \\partial_y f dz + g_3\\right) \\partial_y + \\left(-\\int \\partial_z f dx - \\int \\partial_z g dy + h_3\\right) \\partial_z$$\n\nSince the metric is flat, we know that there are six linearly independent Killing vector fields. These are given by:\n\n1. $X_1 = \\partial_x$\n2. $X_2 = \\partial_y$\n3. $X_3 = \\partial_z$\n4. $X_4 = y \\partial_x + x \\partial_y$\n5. $X_5 = z \\partial_x + x \\partial_z$\n6. $X_6 = z \\partial_y + y \\partial_z$\n\nThese are the Killing vector fields of the given metric."
