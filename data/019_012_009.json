    "message_2": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA: \"I always tell the truth.\"\nIf A is true, then all other statements must be false. However, if A is true, then D (\"I sometimes tell the truth\") would also be true, which contradicts the condition that exactly one statement is true. Therefore, A must be false.\n\nB: \"I sometimes lie.\"\nIf B is true, then it is possible for other statements to be false, which satisfies the condition that exactly one statement is true. So, B could be true.\n\nC: \"I never lie.\"\nIf C is true, then it implies that all other statements are false. However, if C is true, then A (\"I always tell the truth\") would also be true, which contradicts the condition that exactly one statement is true. Therefore, C must be false.\n\nD: \"I sometimes tell the truth.\"\nIf D is true, then it is possible for other statements to be false, which satisfies the condition that exactly one statement is true. However, if D is true, then B (\"I sometimes lie\") would also be true, which contradicts the condition that exactly one statement is true. Therefore, D must be false.\n\nIn conclusion, using paraconsistent logic, statements A, C, and D must be false. Statement B could be true."
