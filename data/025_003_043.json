    "message_1": "Let X be the projective variety in P^2 defined by the homogeneous equation X^2Y - Y^3 - Z^3 = 0. Determine the singular points of X and show that they form a smooth curve.",
    "message_2": "To determine the singular points of X, we need to find the points where the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to X, Y, and Z all vanish simultaneously. The defining equation is F(X, Y, Z) = X^2Y - Y^3 - Z^3 = 0. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂X = 2XY\n∂F/∂Y = X^2 - 3Y^2\n∂F/∂Z = -3Z^2\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n1) 2XY = 0\n2) X^2 - 3Y^2 = 0\n3) -3Z^2 = 0\n\nFrom equation (3), we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: Z ≠ 0\nIn this case, equation (3) implies that Z = 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no singular points with Z ≠ 0.\n\nCase 2: Z = 0\nIn this case, equation (1) becomes 2XY = 0, which implies that either X = 0 or Y = 0. \n\nIf X = 0, then equation (2) becomes -3Y^2 = 0, which implies Y = 0. However, this is not possible in projective space since (0:0:0) is not a valid point.\n\nIf Y = 0, then equation (2) becomes X^2 = 0, which implies X = 0. Again, this is not possible in projective space.\n\nTherefore, there are no singular points on the projective variety X.\n\nNow we need to show that the singular points form a smooth curve. Since there are no singular points on X, the set of singular points is empty. An empty set is considered a smooth curve since there are no points for which the curve fails to be smooth."
