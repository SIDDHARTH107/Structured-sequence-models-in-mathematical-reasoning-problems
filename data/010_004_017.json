    "message_2": "To show that f has a continuous extension from X to Z, we need to find a continuous function g: X -> Z such that g|Y = f, where g|Y denotes the restriction of g to Y.\n\nWe will use the Tietze extension theorem, which states that if X is a normal topological space and A is a closed subspace of X, then any continuous function f: A -> R (where R is the real numbers with the usual topology) can be extended to a continuous function g: X -> R such that g|A = f.\n\nFirst, we need to show that X is a normal topological space. Recall that a topological space X is normal if for any two disjoint closed subsets A and B of X, there exist disjoint open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nSince Y is a compact subspace of X, it is also closed in X (as compact subsets of a Hausdorff space are closed). Therefore, X is a normal topological space, as any compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the continuous function f: Y -> Z. Since Z is a topological space, we can consider the continuous real-valued functions on Z. For each continuous real-valued function h: Z -> R, the composition h ∘ f: Y -> R is also continuous. By the Tietze extension theorem, there exists a continuous extension g_h: X -> R such that g_h|Y = h ∘ f.\n\nDefine a function g: X -> Z as follows: for each x ∈ X, let g(x) be the unique element z ∈ Z such that h(z) = g_h(x) for all continuous real-valued functions h: Z -> R. Note that this definition is well-defined since g_h(x) is uniquely determined by h(z) for each h.\n\nNow, we need to show that g is continuous. Let U be an open subset of Z. We want to show that g^(-1)(U) is open in X. For each continuous real-valued function h: Z -> R, consider the open set V_h = g_h^(-1)(h(U)). Since g_h is continuous, V_h is open in X. Moreover, we have g^(-1)(U) = ⋂_h V_h, as x ∈ g^(-1)(U) if and only if g(x) ∈ U, which is equivalent to g_h(x) ∈ h(U) for all h.\n\nSince g^(-1)(U) is an intersection of open sets in X, it is open in X. Therefore, g is continuous.\n\nFinally, we need to show that g|Y = f. Let y ∈ Y. For each continuous real-valued function h: Z -> R, we have h(g(y)) = g_h(y) = (h ∘ f)(y) = h(f(y)). Since h(g(y)) = h(f(y)) for all continuous real-valued functions h: Z -> R, we have g(y) = f(y) by the definition of g. Thus, g|Y = f.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists a continuous extension g: X -> Z such that g|Y = f."
