    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as AΔB, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection: AΔB = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B:\n\nA = {2, 4, 6}\nB = {4, 5, 6}\n\n1. Find the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B):\nA ∪ B = {2, 4, 6} ∪ {4, 5, 6} = {2, 4, 5, 6}\n\n2. Find the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B):\nA ∩ B = {2, 4, 6} ∩ {4, 5, 6} = {4, 6}\n\n3. Subtract the intersection from the union to find the symmetric difference (AΔB):\nAΔB = {2, 4, 5, 6} - {4, 6} = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is commutative, i.e., AΔB = BΔA:\n\n1. Find the union of sets B and A (B ∪ A):\nB ∪ A = {4, 5, 6} ∪ {2, 4, 6} = {2, 4, 5, 6}\n\n2. Find the intersection of sets B and A (B ∩ A):\nB ∩ A = {4, 5, 6} ∩ {2, 4, 6} = {4, 6}\n\n3. Subtract the intersection from the union to find the symmetric difference (BΔA):\nBΔA = {2, 4, 5, 6} - {4, 6} = {2, 5}\n\nSince AΔB = {2, 5} and BΔA = {2, 5}, we can conclude that the symmetric difference is commutative: AΔB = BΔA."
