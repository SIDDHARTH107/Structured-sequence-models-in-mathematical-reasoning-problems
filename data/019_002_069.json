    "message_2": "Let's define the predicate Q(x) as requested:\n\nQ(x): \"x is a positive integer greater than 5\"\n\nNow, we can use predicate logic to formalize the statement \"There exists a positive integer divisible by 3 and greater than 5\" as follows:\n\n∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x))\n\nThis statement asserts that there exists an x in the domain of natural numbers such that x is both divisible by 3 (P(x)) and greater than 5 (Q(x)).\n\nTo demonstrate that this statement is true, we can provide an example of such an integer:\n\nConsider the integer x = 6. It is a positive integer greater than 5 and divisible by 3:\n\n6 > 5 (satisfies Q(x))\n6 ÷ 3 = 2 (satisfies P(x))\n\nThus, x = 6 is an example of a positive integer that is both divisible by 3 and greater than 5, proving the statement ∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) is true."
