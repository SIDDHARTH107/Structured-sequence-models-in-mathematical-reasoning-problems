    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number of X and Y at the origin, we will use the concept of intersection multiplicities. Let's first find the intersection points of X and Y.\n\nThe equations of X and Y are given by:\n\nX: $x^2 + y^2 = 1$\nY: $xy = z^2$\n\nWe are interested in the intersection points at the origin, so we will set $x = 0$, $y = 0$, and $z = 0$.\n\nFor X: $0^2 + 0^2 = 1$, which is not true. Therefore, the origin is not on X.\n\nFor Y: $0 \\cdot 0 = 0^2$, which is true. Therefore, the origin is on Y.\n\nSince the origin is not on X, the intersection number of X and Y at the origin is 0."
