    "message_1": "In a group of 50 students, 20 are studying French, 25 are studying Spanish, and 15 are studying both. What is the probability that a randomly selected student from the group studies either French or Spanish, but not both?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The probability of a student studying either French or Spanish can be found by adding the probabilities of studying each language individually and then subtracting the probability of studying both.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of students studying only French, only Spanish, and both.\n\nStudents studying only French: 20 (total studying French) - 15 (studying both) = 5 students\nStudents studying only Spanish: 25 (total studying Spanish) - 15 (studying both) = 10 students\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a student studying either French or Spanish, but not both.\n\nProbability = (Students studying only French + Students studying only Spanish) / Total students\nProbability = (5 + 10) / 50\nProbability = 15 / 50\nProbability = 3 / 10\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from the group studies either French or Spanish, but not both, is 3/10 or 0.3."
