    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(3x-7) = 2, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n(√(3x-7))^2 = 2^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x - 7 = 4\n\nNow, we will isolate the variable x by adding 7 to both sides:\n\n3x = 11\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 11/3\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = 11/3."
