    "message_2": "A simplicial complex is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Every face of a simplex in the complex is also in the complex.\n2. The intersection of any two simplices in the complex is a face of both of them.\n\nIn this case, we have a triangle with vertices A(0,0), B(2,0), and C(1,3). We can construct a simplicial complex by taking the triangle and adding all of its edges and vertices.\n\nThe simplices in this complex are:\n\n1. The triangle itself: Î”ABC\n2. The edges: AB, AC, and BC\n3. The vertices: A, B, and C\n\nSo, there are a total of 1 (triangle) + 3 (edges) + 3 (vertices) = 7 simplices in this simplicial complex."
