    "message_2": "To find the average value of the sine function over the interval [0, π], we can use the formula for the average value of a continuous function:\n\naverage value = (1/(b - a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) = sin(x), and the interval is [0, π], so a = 0 and b = π.\n\naverage value = (1/(π - 0)) * ∫[0, π] sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π:\n\n∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n-(-cos(π)) - (-cos(0)) = 2\n\nSo, the average value of sin(x) over the interval [0, π] is:\n\n(1/π) * 2 = 2/π\n\nTherefore, the average value of sin(x) on the interval [0, π] is 2/π."
