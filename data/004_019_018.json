    "message_1": "A particle moves along a straight line and its position at time t is given by s(t) = 5t^2 - 2t + 1, where s is in meters and t is in seconds. Find the particle's velocity and acceleration at t = 3 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the particle's velocity, we need to find the first derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity function v(t).\n\ns(t) = 5t^2 - 2t + 1\n\nTaking the first derivative with respect to t:\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = 10t - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 3 seconds. We plug in t = 3 into the velocity function:\n\nv(3) = 10(3) - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28\n\nSo, the particle's velocity at t = 3 seconds is 28 meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the particle. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the acceleration function a(t).\n\nWe already found the first derivative (velocity function) v(t) = 10t - 2. Now, we take the derivative of v(t) with respect to t:\n\na(t) = dv/dt = 10\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, which means the acceleration is the same at any time t. Therefore, the particle's acceleration at t = 3 seconds is 10 meters per second squared."
