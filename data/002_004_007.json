    "message_1": "John has a rectangular garden that is 15 meters long and 8 meters wide. What is the perimeter of his garden?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, L = 15 meters and W = 8 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(15 + 8)\nP = 2(23)\nP = 46 meters\n\nThe perimeter of John's garden is 46 meters."
