    "message_1": "A ship sails 500 meters due north, then turns and sails 300 meters due east. What is the magnitude and direction of the ship's displacement from its original position? (Round the answer to the nearest tenth if necessary.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the ship's displacement, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry. The ship's displacement can be represented as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 500 meters (north) and 300 meters (east).\n\n1. Calculate the magnitude of the displacement (hypotenuse):\nMagnitude = √(500^2 + 300^2)\nMagnitude = √(250000 + 90000)\nMagnitude = √340000\nMagnitude ≈ 583.1 meters\n\n2. Calculate the direction of the displacement (angle θ):\nθ = arctan(opposite/adjacent)\nθ = arctan(300/500)\nθ ≈ 30.96 degrees\n\nThe ship's displacement is approximately 583.1 meters at an angle of 30.96 degrees east of north."
