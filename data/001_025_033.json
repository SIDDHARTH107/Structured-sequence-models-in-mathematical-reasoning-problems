    "message_2": "To solve the equation |x^2 - 4| = 6, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x^2 - 4 = 6\nx^2 = 10\nx = ±√10\n\nCase 2: -(x^2 - 4) = 6\nx^2 - 4 = -6\nx^2 = -2\n\nSince x^2 cannot be negative, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = √10 and x = -√10."
