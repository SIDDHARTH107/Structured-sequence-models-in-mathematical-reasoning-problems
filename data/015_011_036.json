    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem related to the chaotic behavior of the double pendulum:\n\nSuppose you have a double pendulum system, where the lengths of both arms are 1 meter and both masses are 1 kilogram. The angle between the first arm and the vertical is 30 degrees, and the angle between the second arm and the first arm is 60 degrees. Calculate the maximum angle reached by the second arm before the system becomes chaotic.",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a highly complex and non-linear system, which makes it difficult to predict its behavior analytically. The chaotic behavior of the double pendulum is highly sensitive to initial conditions, and there is no simple formula to determine the maximum angle reached by the second arm before the system becomes chaotic.\n\nHowever, we can use numerical methods and simulations to approximate the behavior of the double pendulum and observe when it becomes chaotic. This would involve solving the equations of motion for the double pendulum using numerical integration techniques, such as the Runge-Kutta method, and analyzing the resulting trajectories.\n\nIt's important to note that the transition to chaos is not determined by a specific angle, but rather by the sensitivity of the system to small changes in initial conditions. As such, the maximum angle reached by the second arm before the system becomes chaotic will depend on the specific numerical simulation and the level of accuracy used in the calculations."
