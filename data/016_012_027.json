    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, and its length increases with each order. To find the length of the Peano curve of order 3, we can use the following formula:\n\nLength of Peano curve of order n = (Length of Peano curve of order 1) * (3^(n-1))\n\nIn this case, the length of the Peano curve of order 1 is 8, and we want to find the length of the Peano curve of order 3. So, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nLength of Peano curve of order 3 = 8 * (3^(3-1))\nLength of Peano curve of order 3 = 8 * (3^2)\nLength of Peano curve of order 3 = 8 * 9\nLength of Peano curve of order 3 = 72\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve of order 3 is 72."
