    "message_2": "Kuratowski's theorem states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nTo determine if graph G is planar or non-planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have v = 12 vertices and e = 16 edges. We need to find the maximum number of faces (f) that can be formed in a planar graph with these vertices and edges.\n\nAccording to the inequality for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nLet's plug in the values for our graph:\n\n16 ≤ 3 * 12 - 6\n16 ≤ 36 - 6\n16 ≤ 30\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that our graph G is planar. However, we still need to check if it contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3.\n\nSince G has 12 vertices and 16 edges, it is not possible for it to contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K5, as K5 has 5 vertices and 10 edges, and adding vertices without adding edges would only decrease the number of edges. \n\nNow let's consider K3,3. A K3,3 graph has 6 vertices and 9 edges. If G contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3, then it must have at least 9 edges. Since G has 16 edges, it is possible for it to contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine if G actually contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3. We would need more information about the structure of G to make that determination.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine if graph G is planar or non-planar using Kuratowski's theorem."
