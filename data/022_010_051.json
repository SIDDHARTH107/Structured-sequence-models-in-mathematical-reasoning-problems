    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the given function, we first need to express it as a sum of two functions, each of which has a simple geometric series representation. We can do this by performing partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{(z+3)(z-2)} = \\frac{A}{z+3} + \\frac{B}{z-2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(z+3)(z-2)$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(z-2) + B(z+3)$$\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can use the following system of equations:\n\n$$A + B = 0$$\n$$-2A + 3B = 1$$\n\nSolving this system, we get $A = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $B = -\\frac{1}{5}$. So, our function can be written as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{1}{z+3} - \\frac{1}{z-2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term separately. Since we are given the annulus $1 < |z + 3| < 2$, we can define a new variable $w = z + 3$, so that $1 < |w| < 2$. Then, the function becomes:\n\n$$f(w) = \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{1}{w} - \\frac{1}{w-5}\\right)$$\n\nFor the first term, the Laurent series is simply:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{5w}$$\n\nFor the second term, we want to find a geometric series representation. We can rewrite the term as:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{5(w-5)} = -\\frac{1}{5}\\frac{1}{1 - (1 - w)}$$\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \\cdots$$\n\nIn our case, $x = 1 - w$, so:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{5}\\frac{1}{1 - (1 - w)} = -\\frac{1}{5}\\left(1 + (1 - w) + (1 - w)^2 + (1 - w)^3 + \\cdots\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can substitute back $z = w - 3$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{1}{z+3} - \\left(1 + (1 - (z+3)) + (1 - (z+3))^2 + (1 - (z+3))^3 + \\cdots\\right)\\right)$$\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of the function is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{1}{z+3} - \\left(1 + (-z-2) + (-z-2)^2 + (-z-2)^3 + \\cdots\\right)\\right)$$\n\nThis series converges for the given annulus $1 < |z + 3| < 2$."
