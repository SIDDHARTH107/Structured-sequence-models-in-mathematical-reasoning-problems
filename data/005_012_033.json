A consumer group randomly selected 50 bulbs and found that their average lifespan was 1480 hours. What is the margin of error for this estimate at a 95% confidence level?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the margin of error for this estimate at a 95% confidence level, we will use the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = Z * (Standard Deviation / √n)\n\nwhere Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, Standard Deviation is the standard deviation of the population, and n is the sample size.\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nGiven:\nStandard Deviation = 100 hours\nSample size (n) = 50\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (100 / √50)\n\nMargin of Error ≈ 1.96 * (100 / 7.071)\n\nMargin of Error ≈ 1.96 * 14.142\n\nMargin of Error ≈ 27.72 hours\n\nSo, the margin of error for this estimate at a 95% confidence level is approximately 27.72 hours."
