    "message_2": "To find the component of the velocity in the north direction, we can use the formula:\n\nV_north = V * cos(angle)\n\nwhere V_north is the component of the velocity in the north direction, V is the magnitude of the velocity (30 km/hr), and angle is the angle between the velocity vector and the north direction (45 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nangle (in radians) = angle (in degrees) * (π / 180)\nangle (in radians) = 45 * (π / 180) = π / 4\n\nNow, we can find the component of the velocity in the north direction:\n\nV_north = 30 * cos(π / 4)\nV_north = 30 * (1 / √2)\nV_north = 30 * (√2 / 2)\nV_north = 15√2 km/hr\n\nSo, the component of the velocity in the north direction is 15√2 km/hr."
