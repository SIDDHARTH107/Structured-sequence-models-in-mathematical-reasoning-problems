    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruences for both x and y using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first need to find the unique solution for each variable modulo the product of the moduli (5 * 7 = 35).\n\nFor x:\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nLet M = 35, M1 = 7, and M2 = 5. We need to find integers y1 and y2 such that:\n\ny1 * M1 ≡ 1 (mod M2)\ny2 * M2 ≡ 1 (mod M1)\n\n7 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n5 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nBy inspection or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find y1 = 3 and y2 = 3.\n\nNow, we can find x using the formula:\n\nx = (a1 * M1 * y1) + (a2 * M2 * y2) (mod M)\n\nx = (3 * 7 * 3) + (1 * 5 * 3) (mod 35)\nx = 63 + 15 (mod 35)\nx = 78 (mod 35)\nx = 8 (mod 35)\n\nSo, x = 8 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruences for x.\n\nFor y:\ny ≡ 5 (mod 7)\ny ≡ 2 (mod 5)\n\nWe can reuse the values of M, M1, M2, y1, and y2 from the previous calculation.\n\nNow, we can find y using the formula:\n\ny = (a1 * M1 * y1) + (a2 * M2 * y2) (mod M)\n\ny = (5 * 7 * 3) + (2 * 5 * 3) (mod 35)\ny = 105 + 30 (mod 35)\ny = 135 (mod 35)\ny = 20 (mod 35)\n\nSo, y = 20 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruences for y.\n\nIn conclusion, the smallest positive integers that satisfy the given congruences are x = 8 and y = 20."
