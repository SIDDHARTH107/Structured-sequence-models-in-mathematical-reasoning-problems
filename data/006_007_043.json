    "message_1": "A company's stock price has 60% chance of increasing by $2 and a 40% chance of decreasing by $3. What is the probability that the stock price will increase or decrease by $2?",
    "message_2": "The problem states that there is a 60% chance of the stock price increasing by $2. There is no mention of the stock price decreasing by $2. Therefore, the probability that the stock price will increase or decrease by $2 is simply the probability of it increasing by $2, which is 60% or 0.6."
