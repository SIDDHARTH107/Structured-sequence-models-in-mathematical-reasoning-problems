    "message_1": "A factory produces 5 different types of toys. They want to create a gift box containing 3 toys of any type. In how many different ways can they choose the toys for the gift box?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 5 types of toys), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 3 toys), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\n\nC(5, 3) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 × 2)\n\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 different ways to choose the toys for the gift box."
