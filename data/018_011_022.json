    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B: A × B. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and C = {1, 3, 5}. The intersection is the set of elements that are common to both A and C.\n\nA ∩ C = {1, 3}\n\nNext, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A × C) ∩ (B × C). Since A ∩ C = {1, 3}, we can rewrite this as (A ∩ C) × C = {1, 3} × {1, 3, 5}.\n\n(A ∩ C) × C = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5)}\n\nNow we have found the Cartesian product of (A × C) ∩ (B × C)."
