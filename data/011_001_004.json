    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 people (n = 10) and we want to choose a committee of 5 people (k = 5).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 30240 / 120\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 different committees that can be formed from a group of 10 people."
