    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the opposite side (a) is 6 and the adjacent side (b) is 8. The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc² = 6² + 8²\nc² = 36 + 64\nc² = 100\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse (c):\n\nc = √100\nc = 10\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 10 units."
