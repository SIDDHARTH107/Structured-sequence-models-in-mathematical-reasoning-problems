    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism are length = 5 cm, width = 5 cm, and height = 8 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDiagonal length = √(5² + 5² + 8²)\nDiagonal length = √(25 + 25 + 64)\nDiagonal length = √114\nDiagonal length ≈ 10.68 cm\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 10.68 cm."
