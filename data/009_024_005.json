    "message_2": "Since the flow is steady, the time derivative term (∂v/∂t) in the Navier-Stokes equation is zero. The equation then becomes:\n\nρ((v·∇)v) = -∇p + μΔv + f\n\nFirst, let's compute the convective term (v·∇)v:\n\nv = (2x^2 + 4y, -4xy, 0)\n\n∇v = (∂v/∂x, ∂v/∂y, ∂v/∂z) = ((4x, 4), (-4y, -4x), (0, 0))\n\n(v·∇)v = (2x^2 + 4y)(4x, 4) + (-4xy)(-4y, -4x) = (8x^3 + 16xy, 8x^2y + 16y^2)\n\nNow, let's compute the viscous term μΔv:\n\nΔv = (∇^2v_x, ∇^2v_y, ∇^2v_z)\n\n∇^2v_x = ∂^2v_x/∂x^2 + ∂^2v_x/∂y^2 = 4 + 0 = 4\n∇^2v_y = ∂^2v_y/∂x^2 + ∂^2v_y/∂y^2 = 0 - 4 = -4\n∇^2v_z = ∂^2v_z/∂x^2 + ∂^2v_z/∂y^2 = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nΔv = (4, -4, 0)\n\nμΔv = (1.789 x 10^-5)(4, -4, 0) = (7.156 x 10^-5, -7.156 x 10^-5, 0)\n\nNow, we can plug the convective and viscous terms back into the Navier-Stokes equation:\n\nρ((v·∇)v) = -∇p + μΔv + f\n\n1.225(8x^3 + 16xy, 8x^2y + 16y^2) = -(∂p/∂x, ∂p/∂y) + (7.156 x 10^-5, -7.156 x 10^-5, 0) + (100, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we can equate the components:\n\n1.225(8x^3 + 16xy) = -∂p/∂x + 7.156 x 10^-5 + 100\n1.225(8x^2y + 16y^2) = -∂p/∂y - 7.156 x 10^-5\n\nNow, we can integrate both equations with respect to x and y, respectively:\n\np(x, y) = -1.225(4x^4/4 + 8x^2y/2) + 100x + C(y) = -1.225(4x^4 + 8x^2y) + 100x + C(y)\np(x, y) = -1.225(8x^3y/3 + 16y^3/3) + D(x) = -1.225(8x^3y + 16y^3) + D(x)\n\nSince there is no information about the boundary conditions or additional constraints, we cannot determine the functions C(y) and D(x). However, we have found the general form of the pressure field p(x, y) that satisfies the given Navier-Stokes equation:\n\np(x, y) = -1.225(4x^4 + 8x^2y) + 100x + C(y) = -1.225(8x^3y + 16y^3) + D(x)"
