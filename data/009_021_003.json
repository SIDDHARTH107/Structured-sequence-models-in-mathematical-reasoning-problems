    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA digital image of size 256x256 pixels is corrupted by salt-and-pepper noise. The noisy image can be modeled as $u(x,y) = f(x,y) + n(x,y)$, where $f(x,y)$ is the original image and $n(x,y)$ is the noise signal that takes the values 0 and 1 with equal probability. A partial differential equation denoising method is applied to the noisy image to enhance it. The diffusion process is given as: \n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (c(x,y)\\nabla u)$$\n\nwhere the diffusion coefficient $c(x,y) = e^{-|\\nabla^2 u|^2/\\epsilon}$ with $\\epsilon=0.01$, $\\nabla^2 u$ is the Laplacian of $u$. The initial condition is $u(x,y,0) = u_0(x,y)$ and the boundary condition is $u(x,y,t) = u_0(x,y)$ at all times $t>0$.\n\n\na) Write the PDE in the form $\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu$, where L is a differential operator.\n\nb) Given the initial condition $u_0(x,y) = 0$, compute the image after time $t=1$ using the explicit Euler method with $\\Delta t=1/4$ and spacing $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = 1$.",
    "message_2": "a) To write the PDE in the form $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu$, we first need to express the diffusion term $\\nabla \\cdot (c(x,y)\\nabla u)$ in terms of differential operators. \n\nRecall that $\\nabla u = (\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y})$ and $\\nabla \\cdot (c(x,y)\\nabla u) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(c(x,y)\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(c(x,y)\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y})$. \n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for $c(x,y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(e^{-|\\nabla^2 u|^2/\\epsilon}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(e^{-|\\nabla^2 u|^2/\\epsilon}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y})$$\n\nThus, the differential operator $L$ is given by:\n\n$$L = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(e^{-|\\nabla^2 u|^2/\\epsilon}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(e^{-|\\nabla^2 u|^2/\\epsilon}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})$$\n\nb) To compute the image after time $t=1$ using the explicit Euler method with $\\Delta t=1/4$ and spacing $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = 1$, we will discretize the PDE and perform four iterations of the Euler method.\n\nLet $u^{(k)}(x,y)$ denote the approximation of $u(x,y,t)$ at time $t=k\\Delta t$. The explicit Euler method updates the solution as follows:\n\n$$u^{(k+1)}(x,y) = u^{(k)}(x,y) + \\Delta t \\cdot L[u^{(k)}(x,y)]$$\n\nSince the initial condition is $u_0(x,y) = 0$, we have $u^{(0)}(x,y) = 0$ for all $(x,y)$. Now, we need to compute the action of the differential operator $L$ on $u^{(k)}(x,y)$ using finite differences:\n\n$$L[u^{(k)}(x,y)] \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2}(e^{-|\\nabla^2 u^{(k)}(x,y)|^2/\\epsilon}(u^{(k)}(x+\\Delta x,y) - 2u^{(k)}(x,y) + u^{(k)}(x-\\Delta x,y)) + \\frac{1}{\\Delta y^2}(e^{-|\\nabla^2 u^{(k)}(x,y)|^2/\\epsilon}(u^{(k)}(x,y+\\Delta y) - 2u^{(k)}(x,y) + u^{(k)}(x,y-\\Delta y)))$$\n\nSince $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = 1$, this simplifies to:\n\n$$L[u^{(k)}(x,y)] \\approx e^{-|\\nabla^2 u^{(k)}(x,y)|^2/\\epsilon}(u^{(k)}(x+1,y) - 2u^{(k)}(x,y) + u^{(k)}(x-1,y)) + e^{-|\\nabla^2 u^{(k)}(x,y)|^2/\\epsilon}(u^{(k)}(x,y+1) - 2u^{(k)}(x,y) + u^{(k)}(x,y-1))$$\n\nNow, we can perform four iterations of the explicit Euler method to compute the image after time $t=1$. Note that since the initial condition is $u_0(x,y) = 0$, the action of the differential operator $L$ will be zero at each iteration, and the image will remain unchanged:\n\n$$u^{(1)}(x,y) = u^{(0)}(x,y) = 0$$\n$$u^{(2)}(x,y) = u^{(1)}(x,y) = 0$$\n$$u^{(3)}(x,y) = u^{(2)}(x,y) = 0$$\n$$u^{(4)}(x,y) = u^{(3)}(x,y) = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the image after time $t=1$ is still $u(x,y,1) = 0$ for all $(x,y)$."
