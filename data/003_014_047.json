    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and vertical shift of the given function y = 3sin(2x + π/3), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sine function: y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D.\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 3, so the amplitude is 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of x inside the sine function, which we'll call B. In this case, B = 2. The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. So, the period of the given function is (2π)/2 = π.\n\nVertical Shift (D): The vertical shift is the value added or subtracted outside the sine function. In this case, there is no value added or subtracted, so D = 0, and there is no vertical shift.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is 3, the period is π, and there is no vertical shift."
