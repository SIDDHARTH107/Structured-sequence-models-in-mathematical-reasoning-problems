    "message_2": "The bifurcation points for the logistic map function occur when the system transitions from one stable state to multiple stable states. To find the bifurcation points, we need to analyze the stability of the fixed points of the logistic map function as the growth rate r is increased.\n\nThe fixed points of the logistic map function are found by setting x(n+1) = x(n) = x:\n\nx = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nSolving for x, we get two fixed points:\n\nx1 = 0\nx2 = 1 - 1/r\n\nNow, we need to analyze the stability of these fixed points by calculating the derivative of the logistic map function with respect to x(n):\n\ndx(n+1)/dx(n) = r - 2 * r * x(n)\n\nAt the fixed points, the stability condition is given by the absolute value of the derivative:\n\nFor x1 = 0:\n|dx(n+1)/dx(n)| = |r|\n\nFor x2 = 1 - 1/r:\n|dx(n+1)/dx(n)| = |2 - r|\n\nThe fixed point x1 is stable if |r| < 1, and the fixed point x2 is stable if |2 - r| < 1.\n\nAs r is increased from 2.5 to 4.0, the first bifurcation point occurs when x2 becomes stable, which is when |2 - r| = 1. Solving for r, we get two values:\n\nr1 = 1\nr2 = 3\n\nSince we are only interested in the range 2.5 to 4.0, the first bifurcation point occurs at r = 3. At this point, the system transitions from a stable fixed point at x1 = 0 to a stable fixed point at x2 = 1 - 1/r = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3."
