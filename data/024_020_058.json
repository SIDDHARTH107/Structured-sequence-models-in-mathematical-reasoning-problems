    "message_2": "To find the preimage f^(-1)((1,0,0)), we need to find all points (x,y,z,w) in S^3 such that f(x,y,z,w) = (1,0,0). This means we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n1. 2xy + 2zw = 1\n2. 2yz - 2xw = 0\n3. x^2 - y^2 - z^2 + w^2 = 0\n4. x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1 (since (x,y,z,w) lies on the unit sphere S^3)\n\nFrom equation (2), we have yz = xw. Now, we can rewrite equation (1) as follows:\n\n2xy + 2yz = 1\n\nNow, let's express y and z in terms of x and w using equations (2) and (4):\n\ny = xw/z\nz = xw/y\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation 2xy + 2yz = 1:\n\n2x(xw/z) + 2(xw/y) = 1\n\nNow, multiply both sides by yz:\n\n2x^2w + 2xw^2 = yz\n\nNow, substitute yz = xw back into the equation:\n\n2x^2w + 2xw^2 = xw\n\nFactor out xw:\n\nxw(2x + 2w) = xw\n\nSince xw â‰  0, we can divide both sides by xw:\n\n2x + 2w = 1\n\nx + w = 1/2\n\nNow, we have w = 1/2 - x. Substitute this expression for w back into equation (4):\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (1/2 - x)^2 = 1\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1/4 - x + x^2 = 1\n\n2x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x = 3/4\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for y and z back into this equation:\n\n2x^2 + (xw/z)^2 + (xw/y)^2 - x = 3/4\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: let u = x^2 and v = w^2. Then, we have:\n\n2u + (uv/u) + (uv/v) - sqrt(u) = 3/4\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2u + v + u - sqrt(u) = 3/4\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in u:\n\n3u - sqrt(u) + v = 3/4\n\nSolving for u, we get two solutions: u = 1/4 and u = 1. These correspond to two different circles in S^3:\n\n1. x^2 = 1/4, w^2 = 1/4, y^2 + z^2 = 1/2\n2. x^2 = 1, w^2 = 0, y^2 + z^2 = 0\n\nThese two circles are disjoint since they have different values of x^2 and w^2. Thus, the preimage f^(-1)((1,0,0)) consists of two disjoint circles in S^3."
