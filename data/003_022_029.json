    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A and B are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √(5² + 2²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNext, we need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of the vectors A and B. We can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = (3 * 5) + (4 * 2) = 15 + 8 = 23\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = 23 / (5 * √29) ≈ 0.8462\n\nNow, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * 0.8462 ≈ 23\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors A and B is approximately 23."
