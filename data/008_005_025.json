    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by 4 and subtract the third equation from the result.\n\n$$4(x - 3y + 5z) - (4x + 5y - 2z) = 4(1) - 0$$\n\n$$4x - 12y + 20z - 4x - 5y + 2z = 4$$\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n$$-17y + 22z = 4$$\n\nNext, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract the third equation from the result.\n\n$$2(2x + y - z) - (4x + 5y - 2z) = 2(6) - 0$$\n\n$$4x + 2y - 2z - 4x - 5y + 2z = 12$$\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n$$-3y = 12$$\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n$$y = -\\frac{12}{3} = -4$$\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the equation we derived earlier:\n\n$$-17y + 22z = 4$$\n\n$$-17(-4) + 22z = 4$$\n\n$$68 + 22z = 4$$\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\n$$22z = -64$$\n\n$$z = -\\frac{64}{22} = -2.91$$\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation:\n\n$$2x + y - z = 6$$\n\n$$2x - 4 - (-2.91) = 6$$\n\n$$2x + 2.91 - 4 = 6$$\n\n$$2x - 1.09 = 6$$\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n$$2x = 7.09$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{7.09}{2} = 3.55$$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n$$x = 3.55$$\n$$y = -4$$\n$$z = -2.91$$"
