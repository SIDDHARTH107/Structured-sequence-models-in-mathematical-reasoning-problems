    "message_2": "To prove that C cannot be the complement of A, we need to show that there is at least one element that is in B but not in C, or vice versa.\n\nLet U be the universal set containing all elements. Since A has 10 elements and B is the complement of A, B contains all elements in U that are not in A. Similarly, if C were the complement of A, it would also contain all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nNow, let's consider the size of the universal set U. Since A has 10 elements and B is its complement, the size of U must be greater than 10. This is because if U had exactly 10 elements, then B would be an empty set, which cannot be the complement of A.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that C is the complement of A. This means that C contains all elements in U that are not in A, just like B. Since both B and C have the same elements (all elements in U that are not in A), they must have the same size.\n\nHowever, we know that C has 10 elements, and since the size of U is greater than 10, B must have more than 10 - 10 = 0 elements. This means that the size of B is greater than the size of C, which contradicts our assumption that C is the complement of A.\n\nTherefore, C cannot be the complement of A."
