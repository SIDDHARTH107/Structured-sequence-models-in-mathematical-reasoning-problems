    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet f(t) represent the position of the car at time t. We are given that the car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, so f(0) = 0 and f(2) = 120.\n\nWe want to show that there exists a time c in the interval (0, 2) such that the instantaneous speed of the car (the derivative of the position function, f'(c)) is at least 60 mph.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem are satisfied. The position function of a car is continuous and differentiable, so the conditions are met.\n\nNow, we can find the average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 2]:\n\n(f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0) = (120 - 0) / 2 = 60 mph\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a time c in the interval (0, 2) such that f'(c) = 60 mph. This means that at some point during the trip, the car must have been traveling at least 60 mph."
