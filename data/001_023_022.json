    "message_2": "To find all solutions to the equation sin(x) = 0.5 for x between 0 and 2π radians, we need to find the angles x for which the sine function equals 0.5.\n\nFirst, we can find the principal angle (the smallest positive angle) that satisfies the equation. We know that sin(π/6) = 0.5, so the principal angle is π/6.\n\nSince the sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants, there will be another angle in the second quadrant that also has a sine value of 0.5. To find this angle, we can use the fact that sine is symmetric about the line θ = π/2. So, the second angle will be π - π/6 = 5π/6.\n\nTherefore, the two solutions to the equation sin(x) = 0.5 for x between 0 and 2π radians are x = π/6 and x = 5π/6."
