    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^2 + 2z + 1), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic equation: z^2 + 2z + 1. We can factor this equation as follows:\n\n(z + 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nThis equation has a double root at z = -1.\n\nSo, the singularity of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^2 + 2z + 1) is at z = -1."
