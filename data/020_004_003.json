    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products P1 and P2. Each unit of P1 requires 2 units of raw material A and 1 unit of raw material B, while each unit of P2 requires 1 unit of raw material A and 3 units of raw material B. The company has 5 units of raw material A and 12 units of raw material B. The profit per unit of P1 is $3 and the profit per unit of P2 is $5. How many units of each type of product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of P1 and y be the number of units of P2.\n\nThe constraints for the raw materials are:\n2x + y ≤ 5 (raw material A)\nx + 3y ≤ 12 (raw material B)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 3x + 5y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we will find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph.\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 5\ny ≤ -2x + 5\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 12\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 4\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities, which is a quadrilateral with vertices A(0,0), B(0,4), C(3,2), and D(2,1).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nA(0,0): Profit = 3(0) + 5(0) = $0\nB(0,4): Profit = 3(0) + 5(4) = $20\nC(3,2): Profit = 3(3) + 5(2) = $19\nD(2,1): Profit = 3(2) + 5(1) = $11\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B(0,4), with a profit of $20. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of P1 and 4 units of P2 to maximize its profit."
