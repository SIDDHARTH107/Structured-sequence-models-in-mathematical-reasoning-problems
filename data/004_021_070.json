    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the object at time t = 2 seconds, we need to find the second derivative of the position function f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x, which represents the velocity of the object:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x - 2)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of f(x) with respect to x, which represents the acceleration of the object:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we can evaluate the acceleration at time t = 2 seconds:\n\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 12\nf''(2) = 12 - 12\nf''(2) = 0\n\nThe acceleration of the object at time t = 2 seconds is 0 m/sÂ²."
