    "message_2": "To solve the cubic equation 2x^3 - 11x^2 + 17x - 6 = 0, we can first attempt to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, 6) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 2).\n\nThe factors of 6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6, and the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. Therefore, the possible rational roots of the equation are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±1/2, and ±3/2.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by substituting them into the equation and checking if the equation equals zero:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n2(1)^3 - 11(1)^2 + 17(1) - 6 = 2 - 11 + 17 - 6 = 2 ≠ 0\n\n2. For x = -1:\n2(-1)^3 - 11(-1)^2 + 17(-1) - 6 = -2 - 11 - 17 - 6 = -36 ≠ 0\n\n3. For x = 2:\n2(2)^3 - 11(2)^2 + 17(2) - 6 = 16 - 44 + 34 - 6 = 0\n\nSo, x = 2 is a root of the equation. Now, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(2x^3 - 11x^2 + 17x - 6) / (x - 2) = 2x^2 - 7x + 3\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation 2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0. We can solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -7, and c = 3:\n\nx = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(2)(3))) / (2(2))\nx = (7 ± √(49 - 24)) / 4\nx = (7 ± √25) / 4\nx = (7 ± 5) / 4\n\nSo, there are two more roots: x = (7 + 5) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3 and x = (7 - 5) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2.\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation 2x^3 - 11x^2 + 17x - 6 = 0 are x = 2, x = 3, and x = 1/2."
