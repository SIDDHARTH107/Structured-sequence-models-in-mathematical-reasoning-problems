    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+5) - log2(x-3) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that logb(A) - logb(B) = logb(A/B). Applying this rule, we get:\n\nlog2((x+5)/(x-3)) = 2\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation to the base 2:\n\n2^(log2((x+5)/(x-3))) = 2^2\n\nSince 2 raised to the power of log base 2 of a number is equal to that number, we get:\n\n(x+5)/(x-3) = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by (x-3):\n\nx+5 = 4(x-3)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nx + 5 = 4x - 12\n\nNow, we can move all the terms with x to one side and the constants to the other side:\n\nx - 4x = -12 - 5\n\n-3x = -17\n\nFinally, we can divide by -3 to find the value of x:\n\nx = -17 / -3\n\nx = 17/3\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = 17/3."
