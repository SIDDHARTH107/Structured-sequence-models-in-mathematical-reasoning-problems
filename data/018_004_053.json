    "message_2": "To find the complement of a set A, we need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted as A', consists of all the elements in U that are not in A. Since the universal set U is not provided, we cannot find the exact complement of A.\n\nHowever, we can prove that the complement of A is unique, assuming that U is given. Let's denote the complement of A as A' and suppose there is another complement of A, which we will call B. By definition, both A' and B contain all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nTo prove that A' and B are the same set, we need to show that A' is a subset of B and B is a subset of A'. \n\n1. A' is a subset of B:\nLet x be an element of A'. By definition, x is not in A. Since B is also a complement of A, x must be in B because it is not in A. Therefore, every element of A' is also in B, which means A' is a subset of B.\n\n2. B is a subset of A':\nLet x be an element of B. By definition, x is not in A. Since A' is a complement of A, x must be in A' because it is not in A. Therefore, every element of B is also in A', which means B is a subset of A'.\n\nSince A' is a subset of B and B is a subset of A', A' and B are the same set. Thus, the complement of A is unique."
