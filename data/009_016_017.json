    "message_1": "A metal sphere with a radius of 5 cm is placed in a region of space where the electrostatic potential satisfies Laplace's equation. The potential on the surface of the sphere is 25 V. Determine the potential at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere. Assume that the potential elsewhere on the surface is zero.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of images. Since the electrostatic potential satisfies Laplace's equation, we can write the potential as a sum of spherical harmonics. In this case, we only need to consider the monopole term, as the potential is spherically symmetric.\n\nThe general solution for the potential outside the sphere is given by:\n\nV(r,θ) = A/r + B*r^(l) * P_l(cosθ)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, r is the distance from the center of the sphere, θ is the polar angle, l is the order of the spherical harmonic, and P_l is the Legendre polynomial of order l.\n\nSince the potential is spherically symmetric, we only need to consider the l = 0 term:\n\nV(r) = A/r\n\nAt the surface of the sphere (r = 5 cm), the potential is 25 V:\n\n25 = A/5\n\nA = 125\n\nSo the potential outside the sphere is given by:\n\nV(r) = 125/r\n\nNow we can find the potential at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere:\n\nV(10) = 125/10 = 12.5 V\n\nTherefore, the potential at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere is 12.5 V."
