    "message_1": "A basketball player has a free throw shooting percentage of 80%. If he takes 5 free throws, what is the probability that he will make exactly 4 of them?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 80% or 0.8)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 free throws)\n- k is the number of successes we want (in this case, 4 successful free throws)\n\nFirst, let's find C(5, 4), which is the number of ways to choose 4 successful free throws out of 5:\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!)\n         = 5! / (4! * 1!)\n         = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (1))\n         = 5\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=4) = C(5, 4) * p^4 * (1-p)^(5-4)\n       = 5 * (0.8)^4 * (1-0.8)^(5-4)\n       = 5 * (0.8)^4 * (0.2)^1\n       = 5 * 0.4096 * 0.2\n       = 0.4096\n\nSo the probability that the basketball player will make exactly 4 out of 5 free throws is approximately 40.96%."
