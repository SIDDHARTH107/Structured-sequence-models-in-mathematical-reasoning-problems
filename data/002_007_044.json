    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm. The longer base is 10 cm and the shorter base is 6 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of the bases) * height.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the bases is 10 cm (longer base) + 6 cm (shorter base) = 16 cm. The height is 8 cm.\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is (1/2) * 16 cm * 8 cm = 8 cm * 8 cm = 64 square centimeters."
