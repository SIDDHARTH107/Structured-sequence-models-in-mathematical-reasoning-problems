    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^4 - 8x^3 + 18x^2 - 11x + 10 over the interval [-2, 4], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 24x^2 + 36x - 11\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n\n4x^3 - 24x^2 + 36x - 11 = 0\n\nThis cubic equation is difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods to find the approximate solutions. Using a numerical solver, we find that the critical points are approximately:\n\nx ≈ 0.423, x ≈ 2.577, and x ≈ 3.000\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) ≈ 74\nf(0.423) ≈ 8.382\nf(2.577) ≈ 1.618\nf(3.000) ≈ 1.000\nf(4) ≈ 42\n\nThe global minimum of the function over the interval [-2, 4] occurs at x ≈ 3.000, with a minimum value of f(3) = 1."
