    "message_2": "a) To determine the degree of the curve, we look at the highest degree of a monomial in the equation. In this case, we have $y^2z$, $x^3$, $x^2z$, and $x^2\\lambda z$. The highest degree is 3, so the degree of the curve is 3.\n\nb) The arithmetic genus of a plane curve is given by the formula $g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$, where $d$ is the degree of the curve. In this case, $d = 3$, so the arithmetic genus is $g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nc) For a non-singular complex projective curve of genus $g$, the Hodge numbers are given by $h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = g$ and $h^{1,1} = 1$. In this case, since the genus is 1, we have $h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = 1$ and $h^{1,1} = 1$.\n\nd) To show that the curve is non-singular if and only if $\\lambda \\neq \\pm 1$, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the curve with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$. \n\n$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 2xz(1+\\lambda) + z^2(1-\\lambda)$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} = 2yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} = y^2 - x^2 + xz(1+\\lambda)$\n\nFor the curve to be non-singular, the partial derivatives must not all vanish simultaneously at any point on the curve. If $y = 0$, then $x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z) = 0$, which implies that $x = 0$, $x = z$, or $x = \\lambda z$. If $x = 0$, then $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} = z^2 \\neq 0$ unless $z = 0$, but the point $(0,0,0)$ is not in the projective plane. If $x = z$, then $\\lambda \\neq 1$, and if $x = \\lambda z$, then $\\lambda \\neq -1$. Thus, the curve is non-singular if and only if $\\lambda \\neq \\pm 1$."
