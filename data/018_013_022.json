    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products of the given sets:\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\nB x C = {(2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products of the resulting sets with C and A, respectively:\n\n(A x B) x C = {((1,2),3), ((1,2),4), ((1,3),3), ((1,3),4), ((2,2),3), ((2,2),4), ((2,3),3), ((2,3),4)}\n\nA x (B x C) = {(1,(2,3)), (1,(2,4)), (1,(3,3)), (1,(3,4)), (2,(2,3)), (2,(2,4)), (2,(3,3)), (2,(3,4))}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n[(A x B) x C] ∪ [A x (B x C)] = {((1,2),3), ((1,2),4), ((1,3),3), ((1,3),4), ((2,2),3), ((2,2),4), ((2,3),3), ((2,3),4), (1,(2,3)), (1,(2,4)), (1,(3,3)), (1,(3,4)), (2,(2,3)), (2,(2,4)), (2,(3,3)), (2,(3,4))}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is associative with respect to union. If it is associative, then we should have:\n\n[(A x B) x C] ∪ [A x (B x C)] = [A x (B x C)] ∪ [(A x B) x C]\n\nHowever, as we can see from the resulting sets, the elements in the sets are different, and the two sets are not equal. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
