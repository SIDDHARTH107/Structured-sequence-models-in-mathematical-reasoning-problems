    "message_2": "To answer these questions, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since A and B are sets of integers, let's consider the universal set U to be the set of integers from 1 to 9, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Now, we can find the complements and symmetric differences.\n\n1. A complement and B complement\nA complement = U - A = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}\nB complement = U - B = {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}\n\n2. (A Δ B) complement\nA Δ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\n(A Δ B) complement = U - (A Δ B) = {5, 6, 7}\n\n3. (A complement Δ B complement)\n(A complement Δ B complement) = (A complement - B complement) ∪ (B complement - A complement) = {1, 3, 6, 9} ∪ {2, 4, 7, 8} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\n4. (A Δ B) complement ≠ (A complement Δ B complement)\nAs we found in steps 2 and 3, (A Δ B) complement = {5, 6, 7} and (A complement Δ B complement) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}. These two sets are not equal, so the statement is true."
