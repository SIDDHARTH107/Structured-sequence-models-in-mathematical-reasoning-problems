    "message_2": "Let G be a group of prime order p. Since the order of the group is prime, every non-identity element generates the group. Let a be any non-identity element in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a is {e, a, a^2, ..., a^(p-1)}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of all elements in G. We have:\n\nProduct = e * a * a^2 * ... * a^(p-1)\n\nSince every non-identity element generates the group, we can pair each element with its inverse in the product. For example, a * a^(p-1) = e, a^2 * a^(p-2) = e, and so on. The only element that doesn't have a pair is the identity element e.\n\nTherefore, the product of all elements in a group of prime order is the identity element e."
