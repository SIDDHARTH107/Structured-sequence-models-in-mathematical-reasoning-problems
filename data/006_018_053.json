    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company within a year, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, fraudulent incidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k fraudulent incidents in a year\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of fraudulent incidents per year (0.05 in this case)\n- k is the number of fraudulent incidents we are interested in (1 in this case, since we want to find the probability of at least one fraud occurring)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- k! is the factorial of k (the product of all positive integers up to k)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-0.05) * 0.05^1) / 1! = (0.95123 * 0.05) / 1 = 0.04756\n\nHowever, this is the probability of exactly one financial fraud occurring. To find the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring, we can calculate the probability of no financial frauds occurring and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.05) * 0.05^0) / 0! = (0.95123 * 1) / 1 = 0.95123\n\nP(at least 1 fraud) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.95123 = 0.04877\n\nSo, the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring in a company within a year is approximately 4.88%."
