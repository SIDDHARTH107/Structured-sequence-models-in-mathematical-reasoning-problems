    "message_1": "A student is conducting an experiment that involves testing 4 factors, with each factor having 3 levels. How many experimental runs will be required if an orthogonal array of strength 3 is used?",
    "message_2": "An orthogonal array of strength 3 means that all possible combinations of any three factors are represented in the experimental runs. In this case, there are 4 factors, each with 3 levels. To determine the number of experimental runs required, we can use the formula:\n\nL^(k) = N\n\nwhere L is the number of levels, k is the strength of the orthogonal array, and N is the number of experimental runs.\n\nIn this case, L = 3 (since there are 3 levels for each factor) and k = 3 (since the orthogonal array has a strength of 3). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n3^(3) = N\n\n27 = N\n\nSo, 27 experimental runs will be required if an orthogonal array of strength 3 is used."
