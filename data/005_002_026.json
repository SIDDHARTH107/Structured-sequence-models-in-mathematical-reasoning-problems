    "message_2": "To find a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the products, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- x̄ is the sample mean (which is the same as the claimed mean in this case, 2,500 hours)\n- Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\n- σ is the standard deviation (100 hours)\n- n is the sample size (36 products)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 100 / √36 = 100 / 6 = 16.67\n\nNext, we will find the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 16.67 ≈ 32.67\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± ME = 2500 ± 32.67 = (2467.33, 2532.67)\n\nSo, based on the sample data, we can be 95% confident that the true mean lifespan of the products lies between 2,467.33 hours and 2,532.67 hours."
