    "message_1": "Two vectors A and B are given. The magnitude of vector A is 5 units and the magnitude of vector B is 10 units. The angle between vector A and B is 60 degrees. Find the angle between the negative of vector A and B.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the negative of vector A and vector B, we can use the fact that the negative of a vector has the same magnitude but points in the opposite direction. Therefore, the angle between the negative of vector A and vector B will be supplementary to the angle between vector A and vector B.\n\nSince the angle between vector A and vector B is 60 degrees, the angle between the negative of vector A and vector B will be:\n\n180 degrees - 60 degrees = 120 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the negative of vector A and vector B is 120 degrees."
