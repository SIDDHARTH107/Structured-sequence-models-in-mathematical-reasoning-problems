Using cluster analysis, group the students based on their subject marks:\n\n| Student | Mathematics | English | Science | Social Studies |\n|---------|-------------|---------|---------|----------------|\n| 1       | 80          | 75      | 85      | 80             |\n| 2       | 90          | 85      | 80      | 85             |\n| 3       | 70          | 80      | 75      | 75             |\n| ...     | ...         | ...     | ...     | ...            |\n| 50      | 85          | 90      | 95      | 90             |\n\nHow many clusters should be formed and which students are in each cluster?",
    "message_2": "To perform cluster analysis, we need to decide on the number of clusters and the method for clustering. One common method is k-means clustering. We can use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. However, since we don't have the full dataset, we will assume 3 clusters for this example.\n\nLet's assume we have performed k-means clustering on the dataset and obtained the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1: High Performers\nStudents: 2, 50, ...\nMathematics: 85-100\nEnglish: 85-100\nScience: 85-100\nSocial Studies: 85-100\n\nCluster 2: Average Performers\nStudents: 1, ...\nMathematics: 70-84\nEnglish: 70-84\nScience: 70-84\nSocial Studies: 70-84\n\nCluster 3: Low Performers\nStudents: 3, ...\nMathematics: 50-69\nEnglish: 50-69\nScience: 50-69\nSocial Studies: 50-69\n\nPlease note that this is just an example, and the actual clustering results would depend on the full dataset and the chosen clustering method."
