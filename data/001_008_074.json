    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 > 7, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality:\n   2x + 3 - 3 > 7 - 3\n   2x > 4\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n   2x/2 > 4/2\n   x > 2\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x > 2.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from -2 to 5 (or any range that includes 2).\n2. Place an open circle at 2, because x > 2 does not include the value 2.\n3. Shade the region to the right of the open circle, indicating all values greater than 2.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n-2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5\n         (------>\n         (open circle at 2, shaded region to the right)"
