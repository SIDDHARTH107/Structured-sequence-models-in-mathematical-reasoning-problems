    "message_2": "In order to be 3-dimensional, the simplicial complex must have at least one 3-dimensional simplex (a tetrahedron). A tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces of dimension 2 (triangles).\n\nSince the complex has 8 vertices and 12 edges, we can try to form two tetrahedra by sharing one common face. In this case, we would have 6 vertices (4 from the first tetrahedron and 2 additional ones for the second tetrahedron), 9 edges (6 from the first tetrahedron and 3 additional ones for the second tetrahedron), and 6 faces of dimension 2 (4 from the first tetrahedron and 2 additional ones for the second tetrahedron).\n\nHowever, this configuration does not satisfy the given conditions, as we have 8 vertices and 12 edges. So, we need to add more faces of dimension 2 to connect the remaining vertices and edges.\n\nLet's add one more face of dimension 2 (triangle) to the complex. This will add 1 vertex and 2 edges. Now we have 7 vertices, 11 edges, and 7 faces of dimension 2. We still need to add 1 more vertex and 1 more edge.\n\nFinally, let's add another face of dimension 2 (triangle) to the complex. This will add the last vertex and edge. Now we have 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces of dimension 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of faces of dimension 2 that this complex must have in order to be 3-dimensional is 8."
