    "message_1": "A company wants to simulate the probability of a product selling out in its first week based on previous data. The company knows that historically, 20% of new products sell out in the first week. Using Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 trials, what is the probability that a new product will sell out in its first week?",
    "message_2": "To perform a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 trials, we will randomly generate 10,000 outcomes based on the historical probability of 20% for a product selling out in the first week. Then, we will calculate the proportion of trials that resulted in a sell-out to estimate the probability.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Set the number of trials to 10,000.\n2. Set the historical probability of selling out in the first week to 20% (0.2).\n3. Generate 10,000 random numbers between 0 and 1.\n4. Count the number of random numbers less than or equal to 0.2 (representing a sell-out).\n5. Divide the count of sell-outs by the total number of trials (10,000) to get the simulated probability.\n\nSince the historical probability is already given as 20%, the Monte Carlo simulation should yield a similar result. However, it's important to note that the simulation result may not be exactly 20% due to the random nature of the process. The more trials you run, the closer the simulated probability will be to the true historical probability."
