    "message_1": "Consider the moduli space of smooth plane curves of degree 3, denoted by $\\mathcal{M}_3$. Let $g_i$ be the genus of the $i^{th}$ curve in $\\mathcal{M}_3$, and let $d_i$ be the number of lines that intersect the $i^{th}$ curve in $\\mathcal{M}_3$. If $i$ ranges over all possible curves in $\\mathcal{M}_3$, what is the sum of all $d_i$ divided by the sum of all $g_i$?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the genus of a smooth plane curve of degree 3. By the genus-degree formula, we have:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. Since we are considering smooth plane curves of degree 3, we have:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nThus, the genus $g_i$ of each curve in $\\mathcal{M}_3$ is 1.\n\nNext, let's find the number of lines that intersect a smooth plane curve of degree 3. By BÃ©zout's theorem, the number of intersection points of two plane curves of degrees $m$ and $n$ is $mn$, counting multiplicities. In our case, we are considering the intersection of a curve of degree 3 with lines (curves of degree 1). Therefore, each curve of degree 3 intersects a line in 3 points, counting multiplicities.\n\nSince each curve in $\\mathcal{M}_3$ has genus 1 and intersects lines in 3 points, the sum of all $d_i$ divided by the sum of all $g_i$ is simply the ratio of these two quantities for a single curve:\n\n$\\frac{d_i}{g_i} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3$.\n\nThus, the sum of all $d_i$ divided by the sum of all $g_i$ for all curves in $\\mathcal{M}_3$ is 3."
