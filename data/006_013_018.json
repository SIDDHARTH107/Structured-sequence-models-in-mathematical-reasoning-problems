    "message_1": "What is the probability that a major earthquake with a magnitude of at least 7.0 will occur in a particular city within the next 10 years, given that the historical probability of such an event is 0.5% per year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. The complement of the event \"a major earthquake with a magnitude of at least 7.0 will occur within the next 10 years\" is \"no major earthquake with a magnitude of at least 7.0 will occur within the next 10 years.\" \n\nLet P(E) be the probability of a major earthquake occurring in a given year, which is 0.5% or 0.005. The probability of no major earthquake occurring in a given year is P(E') = 1 - P(E) = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995.\n\nSince we are considering a 10-year period, we need to find the probability of no major earthquake occurring in all 10 years. The events are independent, so we can multiply the probabilities:\n\nP(no major earthquake in 10 years) = P(E')^10 = (0.995)^10 ≈ 0.9512.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of this probability, which is the probability of at least one major earthquake occurring within the next 10 years:\n\nP(at least one major earthquake in 10 years) = 1 - P(no major earthquake in 10 years) = 1 - 0.9512 ≈ 0.0488.\n\nSo, the probability that a major earthquake with a magnitude of at least 7.0 will occur in the particular city within the next 10 years is approximately 4.88%."
