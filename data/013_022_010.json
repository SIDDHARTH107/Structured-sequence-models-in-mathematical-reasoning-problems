    "message_1": "Suppose two players are playing a Dictator Game. The Dictator (Player 1) is to divide $100 between themselves and the Receiver (Player 2). The Dictator has the option to give any amount they choose to the Receiver, from $0 to $100. If the Receiver accepts the Dictator's offer, then both players get to keep their respective shares. If the Receiver rejects the offer, then neither player gets any money. Assuming that the Dictator wants to keep their share as large as possible, but also wants to ensure that the Receiver accepts the offer, what is the optimal amount for the Dictator to offer the Receiver?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the Dictator has all the power to decide the allocation of the money. However, the Dictator also wants to ensure that the Receiver accepts the offer so that both players can keep their respective shares. To achieve this, the Dictator should offer the Receiver the smallest amount that the Receiver would still accept.\n\nAssuming that the Receiver is rational and prefers to have some money rather than none, the Dictator can offer the smallest non-zero amount, which is $1. In this case, the Dictator would keep $99 for themselves, and the Receiver would accept the offer since they would still receive $1, which is better than receiving nothing.\n\nSo, the optimal amount for the Dictator to offer the Receiver is $1."
