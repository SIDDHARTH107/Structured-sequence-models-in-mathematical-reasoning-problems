    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the mentioned groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. n_3 divides 2^4 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Let P_2 and P_3 be these subgroups. Since P_2 and P_3 are normal, their product P_2P_3 is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are relatively prime, |P_2P_3| = |P_2| * |P_3| = 16 * 3 = 48. Thus, G = P_2P_3. Since P_2 is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16 and P_3 is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is a cyclic group of order 48, C48.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. Since there is more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, they are not normal in G. Similarly, the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal in G. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to C48 or A4 × C4, as both of these groups have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Thus, G must be isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C48 if there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. If there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, G must be isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. G cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4, as this group has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup."
