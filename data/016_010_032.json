    "message_2": "To find the radius of the 100th circle in the Apollonian Gasket, we can use the Descartes Circle Theorem. The theorem states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures (k1, k2, k3, k4), the following equation holds:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nCurvature (k) is the reciprocal of the radius (r): k = 1/r.\n\nGiven the radii of the first three circles (1, 1, and 2), we can find their curvatures:\n\nk1 = 1/1 = 1\nk2 = 1/1 = 1\nk3 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nNow, we can use the Descartes Circle Theorem to find the curvature of the 4th circle:\n\nk4 = 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1) - (k1 + k2 + k3)\nk4 = 2 * sqrt(1 * 1 + 1 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 1) - (1 + 1 + 0.5)\nk4 = 2 * sqrt(1 + 0.5 + 0.5) - 2.5\nk4 = 2 * sqrt(2) - 2.5\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the 4th circle:\n\nr4 = 1/k4 = 1/(2 * sqrt(2) - 2.5)\n\nTo find the radius of the 100th circle, we need to find the pattern in the sequence of radii. The Apollonian Gasket is a fractal, and the radii of the circles follow a pattern. In this case, the pattern is that each new circle's radius is half the previous circle's radius:\n\nr100 = r4 * (1/2)^96\n\nSo, the radius of the 100th circle is:\n\nr100 = (1/(2 * sqrt(2) - 2.5)) * (1/2)^96"
