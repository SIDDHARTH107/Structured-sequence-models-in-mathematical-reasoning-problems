If the population grows at a rate proportional to its size and reaches the maximum capacity in 5 years, what is the population of deer after 3 years?",
    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of deer at time t (in years). We are given that the population growth rate is proportional to its size, so we can write the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere k is the proportionality constant.\n\nWe are also given that the population reaches the maximum capacity of 1000 deer in 5 years. So, P(0) = 500 and P(5) = 1000.\n\nTo solve the differential equation, we can first separate the variables:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫k dt\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 500:\n\nln(500) = k(0) + C\nC = ln(500)\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = kt + ln(500)\n\nTo find the constant k, we can use the condition P(5) = 1000:\n\nln(1000) = k(5) + ln(500)\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = (ln(1000) - ln(500))/5 = ln(2)/5\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = (ln(2)/5)t + ln(500)\n\nWe want to find the population after 3 years, i.e., P(3):\n\nln(P) = (ln(2)/5)(3) + ln(500)\n\nP = e^((ln(2)/5)(3) + ln(500))\n\nP ≈ 709.43\n\nTherefore, the population of deer after 3 years is approximately 709."
