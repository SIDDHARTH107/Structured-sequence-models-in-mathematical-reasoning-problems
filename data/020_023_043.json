    "message_1": "Suppose an investor has $500,000 to invest in three stocks: A, B, and C. The expected returns for the three stocks are 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. The investor also has access to the following information about the three stocks:\n\n- Stock A has a standard deviation of returns of 8%\n- Stock B has a standard deviation of returns of 12%\n- Stock C has a standard deviation of returns of 15%\n\nAssuming that the investor wants to minimize their risk (as measured by the standard deviation of the portfolio return), what is the optimal allocation of their funds among the three stocks?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation of funds among the three stocks to minimize risk, we need to consider the correlation between the stocks as well. However, since the correlation information is not provided, we will assume that the stocks are uncorrelated for the purpose of this problem.\n\nLet x, y, and z represent the proportion of the investment in stocks A, B, and C, respectively. Then, x + y + z = 1.\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio return, σp, can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσp = √(x^2 * σa^2 + y^2 * σb^2 + z^2 * σc^2)\n\nwhere σa, σb, and σc are the standard deviations of stocks A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe want to minimize σp subject to the constraint x + y + z = 1.\n\nUsing the given standard deviations, we have:\n\nσp = √(x^2 * 0.08^2 + y^2 * 0.12^2 + z^2 * 0.15^2)\n\nTo minimize σp, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let L(x, y, z, λ) be the Lagrangian function:\n\nL(x, y, z, λ) = x^2 * 0.08^2 + y^2 * 0.12^2 + z^2 * 0.15^2 - λ(x + y + z - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, z, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 2 * 0.08^2 * x - λ = 0\n∂L/∂y = 2 * 0.12^2 * y - λ = 0\n∂L/∂z = 2 * 0.15^2 * z - λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x + y + z - 1 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = 0.64\ny = 0.24\nz = 0.12\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation of the $500,000 investment to minimize risk is:\n\n- $320,000 in stock A (64%)\n- $120,000 in stock B (24%)\n- $60,000 in stock C (12%)"
