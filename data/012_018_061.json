    "message_2": "To determine the edge connectivity of G, we need to find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nLet's use the following theorem: The edge connectivity of a graph G is equal to the minimum degree of G, denoted by λ(G) = min{deg(v) | v ∈ V(G)}.\n\nFirst, let's find the average degree of the graph G. Since G has 8 vertices and 12 edges, the average degree is:\n\n(2 * 12) / 8 = 3\n\nSince the average degree is 3, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less. Let's assume that the minimum degree is 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the minimum degree is 2. If there is a vertex with a degree of 2, then removing the two edges connected to that vertex will disconnect the graph. In this case, the edge connectivity would be 2.\n\nHowever, if all vertices have a degree of at least 3, then removing any two edges will not disconnect the graph. Therefore, the edge connectivity of G is equal to the minimum degree, which is 3.\n\nSo, the edge connectivity of G is 3."
