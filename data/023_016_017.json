    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x) up to the third harmonic, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for n = 0, 1, 2, 3. The general formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) ≈ (a_0/2) + Σ[a_n * cos(nωx) + b_n * sin(nωx)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, and T is the period of the function. Since f(x) is defined on the interval [0, π], the period T = π, and ω = 2.\n\nThe formulas for the coefficients are:\n\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to π\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nωx) dx] from 0 to π\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[x(π-x) dx] from 0 to π\na_0 = (2/π) * [(πx^2/2) - (x^3/3)] from 0 to π\na_0 = (2/π) * [(π^3/2) - (π^3/3)] = (2/π) * (π^3/6) = π^2/3\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[x(π-x) * cos(nωx) dx] from 0 to π\nSince the function is odd and cosine is even, the product will be odd, and the integral will be zero. So, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[x(π-x) * sin(nωx) dx] from 0 to π\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[x(π-x) * sin(2nx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nWe can use integration by parts twice to find the integral. Let u = x(π-x) and dv = sin(2nx) dx. Then du = (π-2x) dx and v = -cos(2nx)/(2n).\n\nUsing integration by parts twice, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-x(π-x) * cos(2nx)/(2n) - ∫[-cos(2nx)/(2n) * (π-2x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nNow, let u = π-2x and dv = cos(2nx) dx. Then du = -2 dx and v = sin(2nx)/(2n).\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-x(π-x) * cos(2nx)/(2n) + (sin(2nx)/4n^2) * (π-2x)] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1)^n * π^2/(4n^2) - (-1)^n * π/(4n)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series up to the third harmonic:\n\nf(x) ≈ (π^2/3)/2 + Σ[b_n * sin(nωx)] for n = 1, 2, 3\n\nf(x) ≈ (π^2/6) + [(2/π) * (π^2/4 - π/4) * sin(2x)] + [(2/π) * (-π^2/16 + π/8) * sin(4x)] + [(2/π) * (π^2/36 - π/12) * sin(6x)]\n\nf(x) ≈ (π^2/6) + (π/2 - 1/2) * sin(2x) - (π/8 - 1/4) * sin(4x) + (π/6 - 1/3) * sin(6x)"
