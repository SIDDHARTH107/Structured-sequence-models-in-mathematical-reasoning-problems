    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component fails, it is easier to first find the probability that none of the components fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component does not fail is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince the components fail independently, the probability that all five components do not fail is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\nP(all components do not fail) = 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one component fails:\n\nP(at least one component fails) = 1 - P(all components do not fail) = 1 - 0.32768 = 0.67232\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component fails in the system is 0.67232."
