    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n.\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero.\n\nNow, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 1 dx + ∫[0, π] -1 dx]\na_0 = (1/π) * [x | -π to 0 + (-x) | 0 to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [0 - (-π) + (0 - π)]\na_0 = 0\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 1 * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] -1 * sin(nx) dx]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-cos(nx)/n) | -π to 0 + (cos(nx)/n) | 0 to π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(cos(nπ)/n - 1/n) + (1/n - cos(nπ)/n)]\nb_n = (2/π) * (1/n - cos(nπ)/n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ (2/π) * (1/n - cos(nπ)/n) * sin(nx)\n\nLet's calculate the first four terms of the Fourier series (n = 1, 2, 3, 4):\n\nn = 1:\nTerm 1 = (2/π) * (1 - cos(π)) * sin(x) = (4/π) * sin(x)\n\nn = 2:\nTerm 2 = (2/π) * (1/2 - cos(2π)/2) * sin(2x) = 0\n\nn = 3:\nTerm 3 = (2/π) * (1/3 - cos(3π)/3) * sin(3x) = (4/3π) * sin(3x)\n\nn = 4:\nTerm 4 = (2/π) * (1/4 - cos(4π)/4) * sin(4x) = 0\n\nSo, the first four terms of the Fourier series are:\n\nf(x) ≈ (4/π) * sin(x) + (4/3π) * sin(3x)\n\nTo plot the function and the Fourier series on the same graph, you can use any graphing software or calculator that supports plotting functions. Simply plot the original function f(x) and the Fourier series approximation using the first four terms. You will see that the Fourier series starts to approximate the original function, but the more terms you include, the better the approximation will be."
