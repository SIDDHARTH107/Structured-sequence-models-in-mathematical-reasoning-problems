    "message_2": "To solve for x, we first need to understand the definition of the absolute value of a complex number. For a complex number in the form a + bi, the absolute value (or modulus) is given by:\n\n|a + bi| = √(a² + b²)\n\nIn our case, a = x and b = 2. So we have:\n\n|x + 2i| = √(x² + (2)²) = √(x² + 4)\n\nNow, we are given that |x + 2i| = 5. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\n√(x² + 4) = 5\n\nTo solve for x, we can square both sides of the equation:\n\nx² + 4 = 25\n\nNow, we can subtract 4 from both sides:\n\nx² = 21\n\nFinally, we can take the square root of both sides to find the two possible values for x:\n\nx = ±√21\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are x = √21 and x = -√21."
