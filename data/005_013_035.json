The results showed that 25 people preferred pepperoni, 40 people preferred mushroom, and 35 people preferred onion. \n\nWhat is the covariance between the number of people who prefer pepperoni and the number of people who prefer mushroom?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the covariance between the number of people who prefer pepperoni and the number of people who prefer mushroom, we first need to find the mean of each preference.\n\nMean of pepperoni preference (P_mean) = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25\nMean of mushroom preference (M_mean) = (40 / 100) * 100 = 40\n\nNow, we need to find the deviations from the mean for each preference and multiply them together.\n\nDeviation for pepperoni (P_dev) = 25 - 25 = 0\nDeviation for mushroom (M_dev) = 40 - 40 = 0\n\nMultiply the deviations together: (P_dev) * (M_dev) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nSince there are 100 people in the survey, we can now calculate the covariance:\n\nCovariance = (Sum of multiplied deviations) / (Number of people - 1)\nCovariance = 0 / (100 - 1)\nCovariance = 0 / 99\nCovariance = 0\n\nThe covariance between the number of people who prefer pepperoni and the number of people who prefer mushroom is 0. This means that there is no linear relationship between the preferences for pepperoni and mushroom."
