    "message_1": "A retail store and an online retailer are both selling a product for $100. The retail store incurs a cost of $50 per unit while the online retailer incurs a cost of $60 per unit in delivering the product. If both the retailers can set any price they want, what will be their final selling price and profit margin?",
    "message_2": "Since both retailers can set any price they want, let's assume they keep the selling price at $100 for simplicity.\n\nFor the retail store:\nSelling price = $100\nCost per unit = $50\n\nProfit per unit = Selling price - Cost per unit\nProfit per unit = $100 - $50 = $50\n\nProfit margin = (Profit per unit / Selling price) * 100\nProfit margin = ($50 / $100) * 100 = 50%\n\nFor the online retailer:\nSelling price = $100\nCost per unit = $60\n\nProfit per unit = Selling price - Cost per unit\nProfit per unit = $100 - $60 = $40\n\nProfit margin = (Profit per unit / Selling price) * 100\nProfit margin = ($40 / $100) * 100 = 40%\n\nSo, if both retailers keep the selling price at $100, the retail store will have a profit margin of 50%, and the online retailer will have a profit margin of 40%."
