    "message_2": "To find an isomorphism between G and one of the given groups, we will first analyze the structure of G using Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 48 = 2^4 * 3. By Sylow's theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, divides 2^4 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIf both n_2 and n_3 are 1, then G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G, and G is the internal direct product of P and Q. Since |P| = 2^4 and |Q| = 3, P is isomorphic to C16 and Q is isomorphic to C3. Thus, G is isomorphic to C16 × C3, which is isomorphic to C48.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q, which is normal in G. Let P be any 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then |P ∩ Q| = 1, since their orders are coprime. By the second isomorphism theorem, we have G/Q is isomorphic to a subgroup of PQ/Q, which is isomorphic to P. Since |G/Q| = 3, G/Q is isomorphic to C3. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 16.\n\nNow, let H be a normal subgroup of order 16 in G. Then G/H is isomorphic to C3, and G is an extension of H by C3. Since Aut(H) has order 32, which is coprime to 3, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) semi-direct product of H by C3, denoted as H ⋊ C3. In this case, G is isomorphic to H ⋊ C3.\n\nSince H is a group of order 16, it can be isomorphic to C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C2 × C2 × C2 × C2. For each of these possibilities, we can find a semi-direct product with C3, which gives us 4 non-abelian groups of order 48. However, we need to find an isomorphism between G and one of the given groups.\n\nIf H is isomorphic to C4 × C4, then G is isomorphic to (C4 × C4) ⋊ C3. Note that A4 is isomorphic to the semi-direct product of C2 × C2 by C3. Thus, G is isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found isomorphisms between G and the given groups C48 and A4 × C4. We have not considered the case where n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, but since we have already found isomorphisms with the given groups, we do not need to explore that case further."
