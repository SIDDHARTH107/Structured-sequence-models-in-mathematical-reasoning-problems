    "message_1": "Suppose that a company has 10 employees, 5 of which are managers and 5 are programmers. Each manager is responsible for overseeing 2 programmers. If the company decides to split into 2 sub-teams of equal size, such that each sub-team has one manager leading it, how many possible sub-teams can be formed?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. We need to select 1 manager for each sub-team. There are 5 managers, so there are 5 ways to choose the first manager and 4 ways to choose the second manager. However, since the order of choosing managers doesn't matter (i.e., choosing Manager A first and Manager B second is the same as choosing Manager B first and Manager A second), we need to divide by 2 to account for this. So, there are (5 * 4) / 2 = 10 ways to choose the managers for the sub-teams.\n\n2. Now, we need to distribute the 5 programmers among the 2 sub-teams. Since each sub-team must have 2 programmers, we need to choose 2 programmers for the first sub-team and the remaining 3 programmers will be in the second sub-team. There are 5 ways to choose the first programmer and 4 ways to choose the second programmer for the first sub-team. However, again, the order doesn't matter, so we need to divide by 2. So, there are (5 * 4) / 2 = 10 ways to choose the programmers for the first sub-team.\n\n3. Finally, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose the managers and the number of ways to choose the programmers to get the total number of possible sub-teams. So, there are 10 (ways to choose managers) * 10 (ways to choose programmers) = 100 possible sub-teams."
