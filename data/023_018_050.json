    "message_1": "A question a math student can solve related to applying Fourier transform to control theory is as follows:\n\nA control system is modeled by the following transfer function:\n \nG(s) = (s + 2)/[(s + 1)(s + 3)]\n \nFind the steady-state error of the system under a unit step input using the final value theorem and Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state error of the system under a unit step input, we first need to find the system's response to the input. The Laplace transform of a unit step input is U(s) = 1/s. The system's response Y(s) can be found by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input U(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * U(s) = [(s + 2) / ((s + 1)(s + 3))] * (1/s)\n\nNow, we will use the final value theorem to find the steady-state error. The final value theorem states that the steady-state value of a system's response y(t) is equal to the limit as s approaches 0 of s * Y(s):\n\ny_ss = lim (s -> 0) [s * Y(s)]\n\ny_ss = lim (s -> 0) [s * [(s + 2) / ((s + 1)(s + 3))] * (1/s)]\n\ny_ss = lim (s -> 0) [(s + 2) / ((s + 1)(s + 3))]\n\nAs s approaches 0, the steady-state value y_ss becomes:\n\ny_ss = (0 + 2) / ((0 + 1)(0 + 3)) = 2 / (1 * 3) = 2/3\n\nSince the input is a unit step, the desired steady-state value is 1. The steady-state error (ess) is the difference between the desired value and the actual steady-state value:\n\ness = |1 - y_ss| = |1 - 2/3| = 1/3\n\nSo, the steady-state error of the system under a unit step input is 1/3."
