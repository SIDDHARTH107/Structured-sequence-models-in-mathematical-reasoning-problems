    "message_1": "A trapezium has a parallel side of length 15 cm and 8 cm, while the non-parallel sides are both 10 cm in length. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply need to add the lengths of all four sides. The parallel sides have lengths of 15 cm and 8 cm, and the non-parallel sides are both 10 cm in length. \n\nPerimeter = (15 cm) + (8 cm) + (10 cm) + (10 cm) = 43 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 43 cm."
