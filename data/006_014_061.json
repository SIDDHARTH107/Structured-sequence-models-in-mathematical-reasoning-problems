    "message_1": "A system has 5 components and each component has a probability of 0.1 of failure. What is the probability that at least one component will fail in the system?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component will fail, it's easier to first find the probability that none of the components will fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component will not fail is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSince the components are independent, the probability that all 5 components will not fail is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\nP(all components not failing) = 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.9^5 ≈ 0.59049\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one component will fail, we subtract the probability that none of them will fail from 1:\n\nP(at least one component failing) = 1 - P(all components not failing) = 1 - 0.59049 ≈ 0.40951\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component will fail in the system is approximately 0.40951 or 40.951%."
