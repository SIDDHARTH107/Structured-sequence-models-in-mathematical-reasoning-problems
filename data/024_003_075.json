    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (2, 1, 5), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the metric tensor:\n\ng_ij = (X_u · X_u, X_u · X_v)\n       (X_v · X_u, X_v · X_v)\n\nwhere X(u, v) is the parametrization of the surface, and X_u and X_v are the partial derivatives of X with respect to u and v.\n\nWe can parametrize the surface as:\n\nX(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\nX_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nX_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we compute the dot products:\n\nX_u · X_u = 1 + 0 + 4u^2\nX_u · X_v = 0 + 0 + 4uv\nX_v · X_u = 0 + 0 + 4uv\nX_v · X_v = 0 + 1 + 4v^2\n\nSo, the first fundamental form is:\n\ng_ij = (1 + 4u^2, 4uv)\n       (4uv, 1 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form, which is given by the shape operator:\n\nb_ij = (X_uu · N, X_uv · N)\n       (X_vu · N, X_vv · N)\n\nwhere X_uu, X_uv, X_vu, and X_vv are the second partial derivatives of X, and N is the unit normal vector to the surface.\n\nFirst, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nX_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nX_uv = (0, 0, 2)\nX_vu = (0, 0, 2)\nX_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we compute the unit normal vector N. The normal vector is given by the cross product of X_u and X_v:\n\nN = X_u × X_v = (2u, 2v, -1)\n\nTo make it a unit vector, we divide by its magnitude:\n\n|N| = sqrt((2u)^2 + (2v)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nN = (2u/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), 2v/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), -1/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n\nNow, we compute the dot products:\n\nX_uu · N = 0 + 0 + (-2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\nX_uv · N = 0 + 0 + (-2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\nX_vu · N = 0 + 0 + (-2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\nX_vv · N = 0 + 0 + (-2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n\nSo, the second fundamental form is:\n\nb_ij = (-2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), -2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n       (-2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), -2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K, which is given by:\n\nK = (b_11 * b_22 - b_12 * b_21) / (g_11 * g_22 - g_12 * g_21)\n\nAt the point (2, 1, 5), we have u = 2 and v = 1:\n\ng_11 = 1 + 4(2)^2 = 17\ng_22 = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\ng_12 = 4(2)(1) = 8\ng_21 = 8\n\nb_11 = -2/sqrt(4(2)^2 + 4(1)^2 + 1) = -2/9\nb_22 = -2/9\nb_12 = -2/9\nb_21 = -2/9\n\nNow, we compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = ((-2/9) * (-2/9) - (-2/9) * (-2/9)) / (17 * 5 - 8 * 8)\nK = (4/81) / (85 - 64)\nK = (4/81) / 21\nK = 4 / (81 * 21)\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (2, 1, 5) is K = 4 / (81 * 21)."
