    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x using the Differential Evolution optimization technique, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 20 random solutions (x values) within the range [-10, 10].\n2. For each generation, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each individual in the population, create a mutant vector by selecting three other distinct individuals (a, b, and c) and combining them using the mutation factor (F = 0.5) as follows: mutant = a + F * (b - c).\n   b. Create a trial vector by performing crossover between the mutant vector and the original individual using the crossover probability (CR = 0.8).\n   c. Evaluate the fitness of the trial vector (i.e., the value of f(x) for the trial vector) and compare it to the fitness of the original individual. If the trial vector has a better (lower) fitness, replace the original individual with the trial vector in the population.\n3. Repeat step 2 for a certain number of generations or until a convergence criterion is met.\n4. Select the individual with the best (lowest) fitness in the final population as the solution.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find the minimum value of the function f(x) and the value of x at which the minimum value is achieved. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute code or perform iterative calculations. I recommend using a programming language like Python with a library such as SciPy to implement the Differential Evolution algorithm and find the solution to this problem."
