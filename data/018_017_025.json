    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A × B and B:\n\n(A × B) ⊕ B = (A × B ∖ B) ∪ (B ∖ A × B)\n\nTo find A × B ∖ B, we need to find the elements in A × B that are not in B. Since B contains single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, there are no elements in common. Therefore, A × B ∖ B = A × B.\n\nNow, let's find B ∖ A × B. Since B contains single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, there are no elements in common. Therefore, B ∖ A × B = B.\n\nSo, (A × B) ⊕ B = A × B ∪ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} ∪ {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and B:\n\nB ⊕ B = (B ∖ B) ∪ (B ∖ B)\n\nSince B ∖ B is an empty set, B ⊕ B is also an empty set.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and the symmetric difference of B and B:\n\nA × (B ⊕ B) = A × ∅\n\nThe Cartesian product of a set and an empty set is an empty set. Therefore, A × (B ⊕ B) = ∅.\n\nNow, let's compare (A × B) ⊕ B and A × (B ⊕ B):\n\n(A × B) ⊕ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} ∪ {2, 3}\nA × (B ⊕ B) = ∅\n\nSince (A × B) ⊕ B ≠ A × (B ⊕ B), the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
