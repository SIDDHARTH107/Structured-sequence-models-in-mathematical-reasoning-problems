    "message_2": "First, let's compute the second de Rham cohomology group $H_{dR}^2(D)$. Since $D$ is a simply-connected region in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, it has no holes. Therefore, its second de Rham cohomology group is trivial, i.e., $H_{dR}^2(D) = 0$. However, this contradicts the statement that $H_{dR}^2(D)$ should be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. There must be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. \n\nTo clarify, let's compute the first de Rham cohomology group $H_{dR}^1(D)$ instead. Since $D$ is simply-connected, we know that every closed 1-form on $D$ is exact. Therefore, $H_{dR}^1(D) = 0$. Now, let's consider the 1-form $\\omega$ on the boundary $\\gamma$ of $D$. \n\nWe can parametrize the circle $\\gamma$ of radius $R$ centered at the origin as follows:\n\n$$x = R \\cos t, \\quad y = R \\sin t, \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq 2\\pi.$$\n\nNow, let's compute the pullback of $\\omega$ under this parametrization:\n\n$$\\omega|_\\gamma = (R^2 \\cos^2 t + R^2 \\sin^2 t) d(R\\cos t) + R^2 \\cos t \\sin t d(R\\sin t) = R^3 (\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t) dt = R^3 dt.$$\n\nNow, let's integrate $\\omega|_\\gamma$ over the circle $\\gamma$:\n\n$$\\int_\\gamma \\omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} R^3 dt = 2\\pi R^3.$$\n\nSince the integral of $\\omega$ over the boundary $\\gamma$ is non-zero, $\\omega$ represents a non-trivial cohomology class in the first de Rham cohomology group of the boundary, $H_{dR}^1(\\gamma)$. In fact, $H_{dR}^1(\\gamma) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, generated by the cohomology class of $\\omega$. \n\nIn conclusion, there was a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The second de Rham cohomology group of $D$ is trivial, $H_{dR}^2(D) = 0$. However, the first de Rham cohomology group of the boundary $\\gamma$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, with the cohomology class of $\\omega$ being a generator, and the integral of $\\omega$ over the boundary $\\gamma$ is equal to $2\\pi R^3$."
