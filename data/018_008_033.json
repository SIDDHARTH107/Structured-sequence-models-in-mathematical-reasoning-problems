Determine the Cartesian product of A and B, and then determine the Cartesian product of B and A. Show that the resulting sets are not equivalent and thus prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B (A × B):\n\nA × B = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (1, d), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c), (2, d), (3, a), (3, b), (3, c), (3, d)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A (B × A):\n\nB × A = {(a, 1), (a, 2), (a, 3), (b, 1), (b, 2), (b, 3), (c, 1), (c, 2), (c, 3), (d, 1), (d, 2), (d, 3)}\n\nWe can see that the elements in A × B are ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B, while the elements in B × A are ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nNow, let's prove that A × B and B × A are not equivalent sets. Two sets are equivalent if there exists a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the sets. In other words, for every element in one set, there must be exactly one corresponding element in the other set, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, we can see that there is no such correspondence between A × B and B × A. For example, the ordered pair (1, a) in A × B does not have a corresponding ordered pair in B × A with the same elements in the same order. Similarly, the ordered pair (a, 1) in B × A does not have a corresponding ordered pair in A × B with the same elements in the same order.\n\nTherefore, A × B and B × A are not equivalent sets, and this proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
