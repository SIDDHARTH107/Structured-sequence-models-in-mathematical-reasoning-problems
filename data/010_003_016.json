    "message_2": "To determine if X is a regular space, we need to check if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n\n1. X is a T1 space, which means that for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n2. For any point x in X and any closed set F not containing x, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and F ⊆ V.\n\nFirst, let's check if X is a T1 space. Consider the points a and c in X. We can see that there are no disjoint open sets U and V such that a ∈ U and c ∈ V. The only open sets containing a are X and {a, b}, and both of these sets also contain c. Therefore, X is not a T1 space.\n\nSince X is not a T1 space, it cannot be a regular space. Thus, we have found a counterexample showing that X is not a regular space."
