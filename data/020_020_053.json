    "message_1": "A firm is designing a rectangular container with a fixed volume of 2000 cubic cm. The container must have a square base and an open top, and it must be made of a material that costs \\$5 per square cm for the base and \\$2 per square cm for the sides. What dimensions will minimize the cost of the materials used for the container, and what is the minimum cost?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and y be the height of the container. The volume of the container is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * y = 2000\n\nWe need to minimize the cost function, which is the sum of the cost of the base and the cost of the sides:\n\nC(x, y) = 5 * (x^2) + 2 * (4xy)\n\nSince the volume is fixed, we can solve for y in terms of x from the volume equation:\n\ny = 2000 / x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the cost function:\n\nC(x) = 5 * (x^2) + 2 * (4x * (2000 / x^2))\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC(x) = 5x^2 + 16000 / x\n\nTo minimize the cost function, we can find its critical points by taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nC'(x) = 10x - 16000 / x^2\n\nSet C'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n\n10x - 16000 / x^2 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n10x^3 - 16000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\nx^3 = 1600\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 20^(2/3) ≈ 11.31 cm\n\nNow, find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 2000 / (11.31^2) ≈ 15.56 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions that minimize the cost of the materials used for the container are approximately 11.31 cm for the side length of the square base and 15.56 cm for the height.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum cost by plugging these dimensions into the cost function:\n\nC(11.31) = 5 * (11.31^2) + 16000 / 11.31 ≈ 598.75\n\nThe minimum cost is approximately \\$598.75."
