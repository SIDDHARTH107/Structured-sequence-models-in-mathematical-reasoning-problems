    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 1 earthquake in the next year, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of the opposite event occurring. In this case, the opposite event is the city experiencing no earthquakes in the next year.\n\nWe can model the number of earthquakes per year using a Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, earthquakes) that occur in a fixed interval of time (in this case, 1 year) with a known average rate (in this case, 5 earthquakes per year).\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (earthquakes), k is the specific number of events we are interested in (in this case, 0), λ is the average rate of events (5 earthquakes per year), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nSo, to find the probability of no earthquakes in the next year, we plug in the values into the PMF:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-5) * 5^0) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-5) * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) = e^(-5)\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least 1 earthquake in the next year, we use the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - e^(-5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 0.0067\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 0.9933\n\nSo, the probability that the city experiences at least 1 earthquake in the next year is approximately 0.9933 or 99.33%."
