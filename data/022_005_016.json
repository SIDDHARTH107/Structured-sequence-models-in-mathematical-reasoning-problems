    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (sin z)/z^2 at z = 0, we can use the Laurent series expansion of the function around z = 0. The Laurent series of a function is a power series representation that includes both positive and negative powers of (z - a), where a is the point around which the series is expanded.\n\nFor the given function, we can use the Taylor series expansion of sin z around z = 0:\n\nsin z = z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...\n\nNow, we can divide this series by z^2:\n\n(sin z)/z^2 = (z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...)/z^2\n\n= 1/z - 1/3! + z/5! - z^3/7! + ...\n\nThe residue of a function at a point is the coefficient of the term with (z - a)^(-1) in the Laurent series expansion. In this case, the residue of f(z) at z = 0 is the coefficient of the 1/z term, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the residue of the function f(z) = (sin z)/z^2 at z = 0 is 1."
