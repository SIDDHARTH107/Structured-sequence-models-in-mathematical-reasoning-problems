If it is not, then it is a prime number.\n\nHere are the prime numbers between 50 and 70:\n\n53: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 53)\n59: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 59)\n61: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 61)\n67: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 67)\n\nSo, the prime numbers between 50 and 70 (inclusive) are 53, 59, 61, and 67."
