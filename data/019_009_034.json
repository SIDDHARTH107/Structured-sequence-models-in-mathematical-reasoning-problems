    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered true if there is a constructive proof for it. The statement given is: \"For any natural number n, there exists a natural number m such that m is the successor of n\".\n\nLet's consider the natural numbers as defined by the Peano axioms, where each natural number has a unique successor. Given any natural number n, we can find its successor by applying the successor function S(n). The successor function is defined such that S(n) = n + 1, where n is a natural number.\n\nNow, let's take any natural number n. By applying the successor function, we get S(n) = n + 1. Since n is a natural number, n + 1 is also a natural number (by the closure property of natural numbers under addition). Therefore, we have found a natural number m (which is n + 1) that is the successor of n.\n\nSince we have provided a constructive proof for the given statement, the truth value of the intuitionistic statement is true."
