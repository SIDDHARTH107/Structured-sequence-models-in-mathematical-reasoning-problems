    "message_1": "Here is a problem for a math student to solve related to RSA encryption and decryption:\n\nSuppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob using RSA encryption. Bob's public key is (e, n) = (17, 3233) and Alice wants to send the message M = 1234. \n\na) What is the encrypted message that Alice should send to Bob?\nb) If someone intercepts the encrypted message and tries to decrypt it without Bob's private key, what number will they get?\n\nHint: To solve this problem, you need to compute Bob's private key using the extended Euclidean algorithm and then use the formula for RSA encryption and decryption.",
    "message_2": "a) To encrypt the message M = 1234 using Bob's public key (e, n) = (17, 3233), Alice needs to compute the ciphertext C using the formula:\n\nC = M^e mod n\n\nC = 1234^17 mod 3233\nC = 855\n\nSo, the encrypted message that Alice should send to Bob is C = 855.\n\nb) If someone intercepts the encrypted message and tries to decrypt it without Bob's private key, they will not be able to obtain the correct message. The decryption process requires knowledge of Bob's private key (d, n), which is not provided in the problem statement. The interceptor would have to factor n = 3233 into its prime factors, compute the totient function, and then find the modular inverse of e = 17. This is a computationally difficult task, especially for larger values of n. Without the private key, the interceptor cannot correctly decrypt the message."
