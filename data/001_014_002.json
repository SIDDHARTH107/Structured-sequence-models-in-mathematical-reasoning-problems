    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √(12) - √(27), we first need to break down the square roots into their prime factors.\n\n√(12) can be factored as √(2 * 2 * 3) or √(2^2 * 3). Since there is a pair of 2's, we can take one 2 out of the square root, resulting in 2√(3).\n\n√(27) can be factored as √(3 * 3 * 3) or √(3^3). Since there are three 3's, we can take one 3 out of the square root and leave one 3 inside, resulting in 3√(3).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as 2√(3) - 3√(3).\n\nSince both terms have the same square root, we can combine them by subtracting their coefficients:\n\n2√(3) - 3√(3) = (2 - 3)√(3) = -1√(3) = -√(3).\n\nSo, the simplified expression is -√(3)."
