    "message_1": "A triangle has an angle of 40 degrees, an adjacent side of 5 cm, and an opposite side of 8 cm. What is the perimeter (in cm) of the triangle using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the length of the third side. We can use the sine rule to find the length of the third side. The sine rule states that:\n\n(a/sinA) = (b/sinB) = (c/sinC)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle, and A, B, and C are the angles opposite to those sides.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nA = 40 degrees\na = 5 cm (adjacent side)\nb = 8 cm (opposite side)\n\nWe need to find angle B and side c.\n\nFirst, let's find angle B. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, and one angle is 40 degrees, we have:\n\nangle B + angle C = 180 - 40 = 140 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the sine rule to find angle B:\n\nsinB = (b * sinA) / a\nsinB = (8 * sin(40)) / 5\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nsinB ≈ 0.8192\n\nNow, we can find angle B:\n\nB ≈ arcsin(0.8192) ≈ 56.4 degrees\n\nNow that we have angle B, we can find angle C:\n\nangle C = 140 - angle B ≈ 140 - 56.4 ≈ 83.6 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the sine rule again to find side c:\n\nc/sinC = a/sinA\nc = (a * sinC) / sinA\nc = (5 * sin(83.6)) / sin(40)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nc ≈ 7.6 cm\n\nNow that we have all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c = 5 + 8 + 7.6 ≈ 20.6 cm"
