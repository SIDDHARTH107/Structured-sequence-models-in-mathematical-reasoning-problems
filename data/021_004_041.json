    "message_2": "To approximate the definite integral of f(x) = 2x + 1 within the limits of x = 1 and x = 5 using the forward difference method with step size h = 0.5, we will divide the interval [1, 5] into equal subintervals of length 0.5 and evaluate the function at the left endpoint of each subinterval.\n\nThe subintervals are [1, 1.5], [1.5, 2], [2, 2.5], [2.5, 3], [3, 3.5], [3.5, 4], [4, 4.5], and [4.5, 5].\n\nNow, we evaluate the function f(x) at the left endpoint of each subinterval:\n\nf(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3\nf(1.5) = 2(1.5) + 1 = 4\nf(2) = 2(2) + 1 = 5\nf(2.5) = 2(2.5) + 1 = 6\nf(3) = 2(3) + 1 = 7\nf(3.5) = 2(3.5) + 1 = 8\nf(4) = 2(4) + 1 = 9\nf(4.5) = 2(4.5) + 1 = 10\n\nNow, we multiply each function value by the step size h = 0.5 and sum the results:\n\nApproximate integral = 0.5 * (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10) = 0.5 * 52 = 26\n\nSo, the approximate value of the definite integral of f(x) = 2x + 1 within the limits of x = 1 and x = 5 using the forward difference method with step size h = 0.5 is 26."
