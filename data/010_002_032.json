    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence (2, 2, 2, 2, ...) converges or diverges with respect to the given topology τ, we need to check if there exists a limit point for the sequence in the topology.\n\nA sequence (x_n) in a topological space (X, τ) converges to a limit x if for every open set U containing x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, x_n ∈ U.\n\nIn our case, the sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, ...), and the topology τ = {∅, {1}, {1, 2}, X}. Let's check if the sequence converges to any point in X.\n\n1. If x = 1, there is an open set {1} containing x. However, there is no natural number N such that for all n > N, x_n ∈ {1}, since all terms of the sequence are 2. So, the sequence does not converge to 1.\n\n2. If x = 2, consider the open set {1, 2} containing x. For any natural number N, if n > N, x_n = 2 ∈ {1, 2}. Therefore, the sequence does converge to 2.\n\n3. If x = 3, there is no open set in τ containing 3 except for X. However, since all terms of the sequence are 2, the sequence does not converge to 3.\n\nThus, the sequence (2, 2, 2, 2, ...) converges to 2 with respect to the given topology τ."
