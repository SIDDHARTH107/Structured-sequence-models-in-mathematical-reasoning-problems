    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform method, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the given differential equation, we get:\n\nY'''(ω) - 3Y''(ω) + 3Y'(ω) - Y(ω) = U(ω)\n\nwhere Y(ω), Y'(ω), Y''(ω), Y'''(ω), and U(ω) are the Fourier transforms of y(t), y'(t), y''(t), y'''(t), and u(t), respectively.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in terms of the transfer function H(ω), which is the ratio of the output Y(ω) to the input U(ω):\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / U(ω)\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by U(ω), we get:\n\nY(ω) = H(ω) * U(ω)\n\nSubstituting this back into the transformed differential equation, we get:\n\nH(ω) * U(ω) = (jω)^3 * Y(ω) - 3(jω)^2 * Y(ω) + 3(jω) * Y(ω) - Y(ω)\n\nNow, we can factor out Y(ω) from the right side of the equation:\n\nH(ω) * U(ω) = Y(ω) * [(jω)^3 - 3(jω)^2 + 3(jω) - 1]\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) by dividing both sides by U(ω) and Y(ω):\n\nH(ω) = [(jω)^3 - 3(jω)^2 + 3(jω) - 1] / Y(ω)\n\nThe stability of the system is determined by the poles of the transfer function H(ω). The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator of H(ω) becomes zero. In this case, the denominator is Y(ω), which is not a function of ω. Therefore, the system does not have any poles, and it is stable.\n\nAlternatively, we can analyze the characteristic equation of the system, which is obtained by setting the input u(t) to zero:\n\ny''' - 3y'' + 3y' - y = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nr^3 - 3r^2 + 3r - 1 = 0\n\nBy analyzing the roots of this equation, we can also determine the stability of the system. If all the roots have negative real parts, the system is stable. In this case, the roots are r = 1, which has a positive real part. Therefore, the system is unstable.\n\nIn conclusion, the system is unstable based on the analysis of the characteristic equation. The Fourier transform method does not provide a clear indication of the system's stability in this case, as the denominator of the transfer function is not a function of ω."
