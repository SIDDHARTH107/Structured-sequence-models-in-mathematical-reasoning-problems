    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. \n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 12 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 12 cm / 2 = 6 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (6 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 216 cm^3\nV = 288π cm^3\n\nThe volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 288π cubic centimeters or approximately 904.78 cubic centimeters."
