Solve the corrected system of linear equations using the elimination method, and find the values of x and y.",
    "message_2": "First, let's correct the second equation:\n\n2x - y = 6.5\n3x + y = 10.7\nx + 4y = 15.1\n\nNow, we will use the elimination method to solve the system of linear equations. We can start by eliminating y from the first two equations. To do this, we can add the first equation to the second equation:\n\n(2x - y) + (3x + y) = 6.5 + 10.7\n5x = 17.2\nx = 17.2 / 5\nx = 3.44\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the third equation to find the value of y:\n\n3.44 + 4y = 15.1\n4y = 15.1 - 3.44\n4y = 11.66\ny = 11.66 / 4\ny = 2.915\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 3.44\ny = 2.915"
