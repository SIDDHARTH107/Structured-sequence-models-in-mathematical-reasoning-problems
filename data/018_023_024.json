    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. So, A △ B = {1, 3}.\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ {2, 3}. We already know that A △ B = {1, 3}. The symmetric difference of {1, 3} and {2, 3} is {1, 2}.\n\nNext, let's find B △ {2, 3}. The symmetric difference of B and {2, 3} is {3}. Now we can find A △ (B △ {2, 3}). The symmetric difference of A and {3} is {1, 2, 3}.\n\nNow, we can compare the two sets we found: (A △ B) △ {2, 3} = {1, 2} and A △ (B △ {2, 3}) = {1, 2, 3}. These two sets are not equal, as {1, 2, 3} contains an additional element, 3, that is not present in {1, 2}."
