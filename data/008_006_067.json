    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [2-λ 3; 1 4-λ]\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\n|(A - λI)| = (2-λ)(4-λ) - (3)(1) = λ^2 - 6λ + 5\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 6λ + 5 = 0\n\n(λ - 1)(λ - 5) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 5.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([1 3; 1 3]v1 = 0\n\nWe can write the system of linear equations:\n\nv1 + 3v2 = 0\nv1 + 3v2 = 0\n\nThe second equation is the same as the first one, so we only need to consider one of them:\n\nv1 = -3v2\n\nLet v2 = 1, then v1 = -3. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 1 is:\n\nv1 = [-3; 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 5:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([-3 3; 1 -1]v2 = 0\n\nWe can write the system of linear equations:\n\n-3v1 + 3v2 = 0\nv1 - v2 = 0\n\nThe second equation is enough to find the eigenvector:\n\nv1 = v2\n\nLet v1 = 1, then v2 = 1. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 5 is:\n\nv2 = [1; 1]\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues of matrix A are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 5, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [-3; 1] and v2 = [1; 1]."
