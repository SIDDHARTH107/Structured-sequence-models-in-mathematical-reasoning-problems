    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a sample of 100 people from a certain demographic group, at least 20 of them will be affected by a particular disease, knowing that the overall prevalence of the disease in the population is 10%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people affected by the disease) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence of the disease, 10% or 0.1)\n- n is the sample size (100 people)\n- k is the number of successes we're interested in (at least 20 people affected)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 20 people being affected, we need to calculate the probability of 20, 21, 22, ..., 100 people being affected and sum those probabilities.\n\nP(X >= 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nCalculating this sum:\n\nP(X >= 20) = Σ [C(100, k) * (0.1)^k * (0.9)^(100-k)] for k = 20 to 100\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 20) ≈ 0.0574\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 people out of a sample of 100 from the demographic group will be affected by the disease is approximately 5.74%."
