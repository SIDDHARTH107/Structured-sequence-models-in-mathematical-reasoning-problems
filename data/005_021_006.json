    "message_1": "A project manager wants to estimate the average completion time for a construction project. They take a sample of 20 completed projects and calculate the average completion time to be 60 days with a standard deviation of 8 days. Using bootstrapping, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean completion time.",
    "message_2": "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean completion time using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000 or more) from the original sample of 20 completed projects. Each bootstrap sample should have the same size as the original sample (20 projects) and be drawn with replacement.\n\n2. For each bootstrap sample, calculate the mean completion time.\n\n3. Arrange the calculated means in ascending order.\n\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap means. This will give you the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nNote that the actual bootstrapping process requires computational power and programming skills. However, the explanation above provides a general understanding of the steps involved in estimating the 95% confidence interval using bootstrapping."
