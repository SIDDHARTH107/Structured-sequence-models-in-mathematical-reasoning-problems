    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 9x + 15y = 123, we first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9 and 15, which is 3. Since 123 is divisible by 3, there will be integer solutions for this equation.\n\nNow, we can divide the entire equation by 3:\n\n(9x + 15y) / 3 = 123 / 3\n\n3x + 5y = 41\n\nNext, we find a particular solution for this equation. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or trial and error to find a pair of integers (x, y) that satisfy the equation. One such solution is x = 3 and y = 4:\n\n3(3) + 5(4) = 9 + 20 = 41\n\nNow, we can find the general solution for the Diophantine equation. The general solution is given by:\n\nx = x0 + k * (b / gcd(a, b))\ny = y0 - k * (a / gcd(a, b))\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is the particular solution we found (3, 4), a = 9, b = 15, gcd(a, b) = 3, and k is an integer.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nx = 3 + 5k\ny = 4 - 3k\n\nFor any integer value of k, we will get an integer solution for the equation 9x + 15y = 123."
