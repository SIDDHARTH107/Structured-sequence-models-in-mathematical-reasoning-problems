    "message_1": "A trapezium has a length of one of its parallel sides as 10 cm, the length of the other parallel side as 20 cm, and the height as 8 cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two non-parallel sides. Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of these two sides. However, we need to find the base of the two right triangles formed by the height and the non-parallel sides. Let's call the base of the right triangle with side a as x, and the base of the right triangle with side b as y.\n\nSince the two bases add up to the difference between the two parallel sides (20 - 10 = 10), we have:\n\nx + y = 10\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for each right triangle:\n\na^2 = x^2 + 8^2\nb^2 = y^2 + 8^2\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot solve for a and b directly without more information about the trapezium. If it is an isosceles trapezium (meaning a = b), we can proceed as follows:\n\na = b\n\na^2 = x^2 + 8^2\na^2 = y^2 + 8^2\n\nx^2 + 8^2 = y^2 + 8^2\n\nx^2 = y^2\n\nSince x + y = 10, we can substitute y = 10 - x:\n\nx^2 = (10 - x)^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\nx^2 = 100 - 20x + x^2\n\n20x = 100\n\nx = 5\n\nNow, we can find y:\n\ny = 10 - x = 10 - 5 = 5\n\nNow that we have x and y, we can find a (or b, since they are equal in an isosceles trapezium):\n\na^2 = x^2 + 8^2 = 5^2 + 8^2 = 25 + 64 = 89\n\na = sqrt(89)\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = 10 + 20 + 2a = 10 + 20 + 2(sqrt(89)) ≈ 10 + 20 + 2(9.43) ≈ 48.86 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 48.86 cm."
