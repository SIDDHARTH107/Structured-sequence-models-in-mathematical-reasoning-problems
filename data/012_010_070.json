    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can find a minimum vertex cover by selecting vertices {1, 3, 5}. This covers all the edges:\n\n- {1, 2} is covered by vertex 1\n- {1, 3} is covered by vertex 1\n- {1, 4} is covered by vertex 1\n- {2, 3} is covered by vertex 3\n- {3, 4} is covered by vertex 3\n- {4, 5} is covered by vertex 5\n\nNo smaller vertex cover exists, so the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph is 3."
