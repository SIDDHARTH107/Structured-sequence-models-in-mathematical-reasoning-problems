    "message_2": "To solve the equation |4x - 6| = 10, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 4x - 6 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can directly write the equation as:\n4x - 6 = 10\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n4x = 16\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 4x - 6 is negative\nIn this case, we need to change the sign of the expression inside the absolute value:\n-(4x - 6) = 10\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n-4x + 6 = 10\n-4x = 4\nx = -1\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 4 and x = -1."
