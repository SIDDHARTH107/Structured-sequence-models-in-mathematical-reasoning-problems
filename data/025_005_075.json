    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety given by the equation x^3 + y^3 = 3xyz, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xyz.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. Let's first solve the first equation for z:\n\nz = x^2/y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z into the second equation:\n\ny^2 - x(x^2/y) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^3 - x^3 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n(y - x)(y^2 + xy + x^2) = 0\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\n1) y - x = 0, which implies y = x. Substituting this into the equation z = x^2/y, we get z = x. So, the points on the diagonal x = y = z are singular points.\n\n2) y^2 + xy + x^2 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in y:\n\ny^2 + xy + x^2 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for y:\n\ny = (-x ± √(x^2 - 4x^2))/2\n\nHowever, the discriminant (x^2 - 4x^2) is negative, so there are no real solutions for y in this case.\n\nThus, the singular points of the algebraic variety are the points on the diagonal x = y = z."
