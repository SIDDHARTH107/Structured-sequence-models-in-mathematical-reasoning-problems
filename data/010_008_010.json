    "message_2": "To calculate the Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex formed by the union of a tetrahedron and a triangular pyramid, we first need to determine the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) in the complex. Then, we can use the Euler-Poincaré formula:\n\nEuler characteristic (χ) = V - E + F\n\n1. Tetrahedron:\nA tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces.\n\n2. Triangular pyramid:\nA triangular pyramid has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces.\n\nNow, let's consider the union of these two shapes. We need to determine if any vertices, edges, or faces are shared between the two shapes.\n\nLet's assume that the triangular pyramid is attached to one of the faces of the tetrahedron. In this case, they share 1 face, 3 edges, and 3 vertices.\n\nUnion of tetrahedron and triangular pyramid:\nVertices (V) = (4 + 4) - 3 = 5\nEdges (E) = (6 + 6) - 3 = 9\nFaces (F) = (4 + 4) - 1 = 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ = V - E + F = 5 - 9 + 7 = 3\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex formed by the union of a tetrahedron and a triangular pyramid is 3."
