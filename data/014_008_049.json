    "message_2": "A 128-bit block has 2^128 possible unique combinations, as each bit can be either 0 or 1. When using a block cipher, each of these combinations can be mapped to another unique combination. Therefore, the number of possible permutations of a 128-bit block using a block cipher is (2^128)! (factorial).\n\nHowever, calculating (2^128)! is computationally infeasible due to its enormous size."
