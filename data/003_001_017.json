    "message_1": "A student is standing 15 meters away from a building. If the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the building is 30 degrees, what is the height of the building? (Round to the nearest hundredth)",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the building (15 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 15\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15:\n\nheight = 15 * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nheight ≈ 15 * 0.577\n\nheight ≈ 8.655\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the height of the building is approximately 8.66 meters."
