    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we can use the provided tree decomposition as a starting point. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the original graph, and it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags must contain all vertices of the original graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the original graph, there must be a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the original graph, the bags containing v must form a connected subtree.\n\nThe given tree decomposition is:\n\n{1, 2, 3}\n   |\n{2, 4, 5}\n   |\n{2, 6, 7}\n\nThis tree decomposition satisfies all three conditions:\n\n1. All vertices from the original graph are included in the bags.\n2. All edges are represented in the bags: (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,7), (6,7).\n3. The bags containing each vertex form a connected subtree.\n\nThe treewidth of a graph is the minimum size of the largest bag in any valid tree decomposition minus one. In this case, the largest bag size is 3, so the treewidth is 3 - 1 = 2."
