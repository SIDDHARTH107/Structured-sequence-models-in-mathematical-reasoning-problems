    "message_2": "To find the minimum size of a tree decomposition for the given graph, we first need to find its treewidth. The treewidth of a graph is the minimum size of the largest clique in a tree decomposition minus one.\n\nA tree decomposition of the given graph can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. {1, 2, 3}\n2. {3, 4, 5}\n3. {4, 6, 7}\n4. {5, 6, 8}\n5. {6, 7, 8}\n\nThe tree decomposition has the following structure:\n\n  1\n  |\n  2\n / \\\n3   4\n \\ /\n  5\n\nThe largest clique in this tree decomposition has 3 vertices. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nThe minimum size of a tree decomposition for the given graph is the treewidth + 1, which is 2 + 1 = 3."
