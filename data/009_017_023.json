    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying a steady current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point P due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length element of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a straight wire, the magnetic field at a point P at a perpendicular distance R from the wire can be found by integrating the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the wire. Let's consider a small current element Idl at a distance x from one end of the wire. The position vector r from the current element to the point P is given by:\n\nr = √(x² + R²)\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field dB at point P due to the small current element Idl:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * R) / (x² + R²)^(3/2)\n\nSince the magnetic field is in the same direction for all current elements along the wire, we can integrate dB along the length of the wire (from x = 0 to x = 2 meters) to find the total magnetic field B at point P:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl * R) / (x² + R²)^(3/2)\n\nLet's plug in the given values: I = 3 A, R = 4 cm = 0.04 m, and μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A:\n\nB = ∫(4π × 10⁻⁷ / 4π) * (3 * dl * 0.04) / (x² + 0.04²)^(3/2)\n\nThe 4π terms cancel out:\n\nB = ∫(10⁻⁷ * 3 * dl * 0.04) / (x² + 0.04²)^(3/2)\n\nNow, integrate with respect to x from 0 to 2 meters:\n\nB = 10⁻⁷ * 3 * 0.04 * ∫(1) / (x² + 0.04²)^(3/2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let x = 0.04 * tanh(u), then dx = 0.04 * sech²(u) du:\n\nB = 10⁻⁷ * 3 * 0.04 * ∫(1) / (0.04² * (tanh²(u) + 1))^(3/2) * 0.04 * sech²(u) du\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nB = 3 * 10⁻⁷ * ∫sech(u) du from u = 0 to u = arctanh(2/0.04)\n\nNow, integrate sech(u) with respect to u:\n\nB = 3 * 10⁻⁷ * [sinh^(-1)(sinh(u))] from u = 0 to u = arctanh(2/0.04)\n\nEvaluate the integral:\n\nB = 3 * 10⁻⁷ * (sinh^(-1)(sinh(arctanh(2/0.04))) - sinh^(-1)(sinh(0)))\n\nB = 3 * 10⁻⁷ * (arctanh(2/0.04))\n\nNow, calculate the numerical value:\n\nB ≈ 3 * 10⁻⁷ * (1.5493) = 4.648 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field produced at a point 4 cm away from the straight wire carrying a steady current of 3 A is approximately 4.648 × 10⁻⁷ T."
