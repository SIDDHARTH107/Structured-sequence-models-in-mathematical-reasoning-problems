    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, and r is the radius.\n\nGiven that the radius of the circle is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(5 cm) = 10π cm ≈ 31.42 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 31.42 cm."
