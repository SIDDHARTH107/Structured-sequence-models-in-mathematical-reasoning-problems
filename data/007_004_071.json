    "message_2": "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 84 and 120, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (120) by the smaller number (84) and find the remainder.\n   120 รท 84 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 36.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (120) with the smaller number (84) and the smaller number with the remainder (36).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 84 and 36.\n\n3. Divide 84 by 36.\n   84 รท 36 = 2 (quotient) with a remainder of 12.\n\n4. Replace 84 with 36 and 36 with 12.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 36 and 12.\n\n5. Divide 36 by 12.\n   36 รท 12 = 3 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12. Therefore, the GCD of 84 and 120 is 12."
