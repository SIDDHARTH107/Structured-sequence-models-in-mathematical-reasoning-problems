    "message_1": "A manufacturing company conducted a study on the number of work hours and the number of defective products produced. They found that for every 10 hours worked, there are 2 defective products produced. Using causal logic, how many defective products can they expect to produce if they work for 35 hours?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of defective products produced in 35 hours, we can set up a proportion:\n\n(Defective products in 35 hours) / 35 hours = 2 defective products / 10 hours\n\nLet x be the number of defective products in 35 hours. Then the proportion can be written as:\n\nx / 35 = 2 / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (2 / 10) * 35\n\nx = 0.2 * 35\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, they can expect to produce 7 defective products if they work for 35 hours."
