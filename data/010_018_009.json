    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient of a function is given by the partial derivatives with respect to each variable. In this case, we have two variables, x and y.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = -2y\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n2x = 0 => x = 0\n-2y = 0 => y = 0\n\nThe only point that satisfies both equations is (0, 0). Therefore, there is only 1 critical point in the Morse-Smale complex of the function f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2, which is the point (0, 0)."
