    "message_1": "In a round-robin tournament with 5 teams, each team will play once against every other team. How many matches will be played in total? (Hint: use the Catalan number formula)",
    "message_2": "The Catalan number formula is not applicable in this situation. Instead, we can use the combination formula to find the number of matches played in a round-robin tournament.\n\nIn a round-robin tournament with n teams, each team plays against every other team exactly once. To find the total number of matches, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (number of teams) and k = 2 (since each match consists of 2 teams). So, we have:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!3!)\nC(5, 2) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)*(3*2*1))\nC(5, 2) = (5*4) / (2)\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, there will be 10 matches played in total in a round-robin tournament with 5 teams."
