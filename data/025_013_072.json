    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian matrix, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 3x - 5. Then, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 3\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we can form the Jacobian matrix J:\n\nJ = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n    | -3x^2 + 3  2y  |\n\nNext, we need to evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the point (1, 2):\n\nJ(1, 2) = | -3(1)^2 + 3  2(2) |\n          |      0        4   |\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the point (1, 2) is:\n\nJ(1, 2) = | 0  4 |\n          |      |\n          |      |"
