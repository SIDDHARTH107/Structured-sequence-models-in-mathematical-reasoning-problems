    "message_2": "The largest value of c for which the Julia Set of f(z) = z^2 + c is connected to the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot Set occurs at the boundary between the main cardioid and the largest attached bulb. This boundary point is given by the following parametric equation:\n\nc = 0.25 + e^(i * pi * (1 - 1/2))\n\nHere, i is the imaginary unit. When we calculate the real part of c, we get:\n\nc = 0.25 + cos(pi * (1 - 1/2))\nc = 0.25 + cos(pi * 1/2)\nc = 0.25\n\nSo, the largest value of c (rounded to two decimal places) for which the Julia Set of f(z) = z^2 + c is connected to the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot Set is 0.25."
