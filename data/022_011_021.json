    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the zero at z=0 for the function f(z) = sin(z)/z^3, we can use the Taylor series expansion of sin(z) around z=0. The Taylor series expansion of sin(z) is:\n\nsin(z) = z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...\n\nNow, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...)/z^3\n\nDividing each term by z^3, we get:\n\nf(z) = (1 - (z^2)/3! + (z^4)/5! - (z^6)/7! + ...)\n\nNow, we can see that f(z) has a removable zero at z=0, as the function is well-defined and continuous at z=0. The order of the zero is 1, as there is only one power of z in the first term of the series (z^0 = 1). So, the zero at z=0 is a removable zero of order 1."
