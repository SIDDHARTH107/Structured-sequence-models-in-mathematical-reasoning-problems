    "message_2": "The degree of a hypersurface in projective space is determined by the highest total degree of the monomials in its defining homogeneous polynomial. In this case, the polynomial is:\n\nf(x,y,z,w) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 - 6xyzw\n\nThe monomials are x^3, y^3, z^3, w^3, and -6xyzw. The total degrees of these monomials are:\n\n- x^3: 3 (since x has degree 3)\n- y^3: 3 (since y has degree 3)\n- z^3: 3 (since z has degree 3)\n- w^3: 3 (since w has degree 3)\n- -6xyzw: 4 (since x, y, z, and w each have degree 1, and their product has degree 1+1+1+1=4)\n\nThe highest total degree among these monomials is 4. Therefore, the degree of the hypersurface of the Fano variety in P^3 defined by this polynomial is 4."
