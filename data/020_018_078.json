    "message_1": "Suppose that two companies, A and B, are competing for a market share in a town. The market size is limited to 10,000 customers, and each company can capture a share of these customers based on their advertising budget. The cost of advertising for company A is $2 per customer, while the cost for company B is $4 per customer. If company A spends x dollars on advertising and company B spends y dollars on advertising, their market shares, as a function of their advertising expenditure, are given by:\n\nSA = 100x / (2x + 4y + 100)\nSB = 100y / (2x + 4y + 100)\n\nWhat values of x and y will result in the highest combined market share for both companies?",
    "message_2": "To find the values of x and y that result in the highest combined market share for both companies, we need to maximize the sum of their market shares, SA + SB.\n\nSA + SB = (100x / (2x + 4y + 100)) + (100y / (2x + 4y + 100))\n\nWe can simplify this expression by combining the fractions:\n\nSA + SB = (100x + 100y) / (2x + 4y + 100)\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives of SA + SB with respect to x and y:\n\n∂(SA + SB) / ∂x = (100(2x + 4y + 100) - 200x) / (2x + 4y + 100)^2\n∂(SA + SB) / ∂y = (100(2x + 4y + 100) - 400y) / (2x + 4y + 100)^2\n\nTo find the critical points, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x and y:\n\n100(2x + 4y + 100) - 200x = 0\n100(2x + 4y + 100) - 400y = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nx = 50\ny = 25\n\nSo, the values of x and y that result in the highest combined market share for both companies are x = 50 and y = 25."
