Plot the resulting values of x_n on a graph and observe the behavior for increasing values of r.",
    "message_2": "To find the first value of r for which the logistic equation exhibits chaotic behavior, we will follow the hint and iterate the logistic equation for 50 iterations using different values of r between 0 and 4. We will use a starting value of x = 0.5.\n\nLet's start by defining the logistic equation as a function:\n\nf(x, r) = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nNow, we will iterate the logistic equation for 50 iterations using different values of r between 0 and 4:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef logistic_equation(x, r):\n    return r * x * (1 - x)\n\nx = 0.5\niterations = 50\nr_values = np.linspace(0, 4, 1000)\nx_values = []\n\nfor r in r_values:\n    x_temp = x\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        x_temp = logistic_equation(x_temp, r)\n    x_values.append(x_temp)\n\nplt.plot(r_values, x_values, '.')\nplt.xlabel('r')\nplt.ylabel('x_n')\nplt.title('Bifurcation Diagram')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy observing the bifurcation diagram, we can see that the logistic equation starts to exhibit chaotic behavior around r = 3.57. This is the first value of r for which the logistic equation exhibits chaotic behavior."
