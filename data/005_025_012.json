    "message_1": "A company claims that the average weight of their cereal box is 400 grams. To investigate this claim, a math student randomly selects 30 cereal boxes and finds the average weight of these boxes to be 390 grams with a standard deviation of 20 grams. Can the student conclude that the average weight of the cereal box differs from the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the student can conclude that the average weight of the cereal box differs from the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05, we will perform a t-test.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The average weight of the cereal box is 400 grams (µ = 400).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The average weight of the cereal box is not 400 grams (µ ≠ 400).\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 30\nSample mean (x̄) = 390 grams\nSample standard deviation (s) = 20 grams\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is 30, which is less than 30, we will use a t-distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - µ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (390 - 400) / (20 / √30)\nt = -10 / (20 / 5.48)\nt = -10 / 3.65\nt = -2.74\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.045.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-2.74) is less than the critical t-value (-2.045), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the student can conclude that the average weight of the cereal box differs from the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05."
