    "message_1": "Suppose you are a thief and have a backpack with a weight limit of 15 kg. You come across a jewelry store with the following items and their respective weights and values:\n\nItem A: Weight 4 kg, Value 10\nItem B: Weight 3 kg, Value 8\nItem C: Weight 7 kg, Value 15\nItem D: Weight 5 kg, Value 12\n\nWhat is the maximum total value of items that you can steal while staying within the weight limit of your backpack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum total value of items that can be stolen while staying within the weight limit of the backpack, we can use a greedy algorithm approach by calculating the value-to-weight ratio for each item and then selecting the items with the highest ratios until the backpack is full or no more items can be added.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\nItem A: 10 / 4 = 2.5\nItem B: 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67\nItem C: 15 / 7 ≈ 2.14\nItem D: 12 / 5 = 2.4\n\nSort the items by their value-to-weight ratios in descending order:\nItem B, Item A, Item D, Item C\n\nNow, we will add the items to the backpack based on this order:\n1. Add Item B (3 kg, Value 8)\n2. Add Item A (4 kg, Value 10)\n3. Add Item D (5 kg, Value 12)\n\nAt this point, the backpack has a total weight of 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 kg, and adding Item C would exceed the weight limit. Therefore, the maximum total value of items that can be stolen while staying within the weight limit of the backpack is 8 + 10 + 12 = 30."
