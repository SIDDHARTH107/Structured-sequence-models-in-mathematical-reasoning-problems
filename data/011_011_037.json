    "message_2": "Let's denote the 9 distinct numbers as a_1, a_2, ..., a_9, and the three subsets as A, B, and C. We want to find the number of ways to partition these numbers into the three subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is unique.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the possible sums for each subset. Since the numbers are distinct, the minimum sum occurs when we have the three smallest numbers, and the maximum sum occurs when we have the three largest numbers. So, the minimum sum is a_1 + a_2 + a_3, and the maximum sum is a_7 + a_8 + a_9.\n\nNow, let's consider the middle sum, which is the sum of the remaining three numbers. This sum must be greater than the minimum sum and less than the maximum sum. So, it must be in the range (a_1 + a_2 + a_3, a_7 + a_8 + a_9).\n\nTo count the number of ways to partition the numbers into the three subsets, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Choose the three numbers for subset A. There are C(9, 3) = 84 ways to do this.\n2. Choose the three numbers for subset B from the remaining six numbers. There are C(6, 3) = 20 ways to do this.\n3. The remaining three numbers form subset C.\n\nHowever, this approach overcounts the number of valid partitions because it doesn't account for the condition that the sums must be unique. To correct for this, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet's consider the cases where two of the subsets have the same sum:\n\n1. A and B have the same sum: There are C(6, 3) = 20 ways to choose the three numbers for subset A and B, and the remaining three numbers form subset C.\n2. A and C have the same sum: There are C(6, 3) = 20 ways to choose the three numbers for subset A and C, and the remaining three numbers form subset B.\n3. B and C have the same sum: There are C(6, 3) = 20 ways to choose the three numbers for subset B and C, and the remaining three numbers form subset A.\n\nNow, we need to subtract these cases from the total count. However, we also need to consider the case where all three subsets have the same sum, which we have subtracted three times. There is only 1 way for this to happen: when the numbers are consecutive integers, and the subsets are {a_1, a_4, a_7}, {a_2, a_5, a_8}, and {a_3, a_6, a_9}.\n\nSo, the final count of valid partitions is:\n\n84 * 20 - 3 * 20 + 1 = 1680 - 60 + 1 = 1621.\n\nTherefore, there are 1621 ways to partition the 9 distinct numbers into three subsets of three numbers each, such that each subset has a unique sum."
