    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = sin(x), and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π:\n\n∫[0, π] sin(x) dx = [-cos(x)] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\n[-cos(π)] - [-cos(0)] = (-(-1)) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 2 = 2/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = sin(x) on the interval [0, π] is 2/π."
