    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we will start with an arbitrary vertex and then iteratively add the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree. We will continue this process until all vertices are included in the tree.\n\nLet's start with vertex A:\n\n1. Add vertex A to the tree.\n2. Find the minimum weight edge connecting a vertex in the tree (A) to a vertex outside the tree. The edge with the minimum weight is A-B with a weight of 2.\n3. Add vertex B and edge A-B to the tree.\n4. Now, we have vertices A and B in the tree. Find the minimum weight edge connecting vertices A or B to a vertex outside the tree. The edge with the minimum weight is B-C with a weight of 3.\n5. Add vertex C and edge B-C to the tree.\n6. Now, we have vertices A, B, and C in the tree. Find the minimum weight edge connecting vertices A, B, or C to a vertex outside the tree. The edge with the minimum weight is C-D with a weight of 4.\n7. Add vertex D and edge C-D to the tree.\n8. Now, we have vertices A, B, C, and D in the tree. Find the minimum weight edge connecting vertices A, B, C, or D to a vertex outside the tree. The edge with the minimum weight is D-E with a weight of 5.\n9. Add vertex E and edge D-E to the tree.\n\nNow all vertices are included in the tree, and the minimum spanning tree is complete. The minimum spanning tree consists of the edges A-B, B-C, C-D, and D-E.\n\nTo calculate the total weight of the minimum spanning tree, add the weights of all the edges:\n\nTotal weight = 2 (A-B) + 3 (B-C) + 4 (C-D) + 5 (D-E) = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 14."
