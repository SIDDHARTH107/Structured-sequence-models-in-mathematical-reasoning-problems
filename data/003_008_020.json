    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and C is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm, b = 8 cm, and C = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 8 * sin(π / 3)\n\nThe sine of π / 3 (or 60 degrees) is √3 / 2:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 8 * (√3 / 2)\n\nArea = 20 * (√3 / 2)\n\nArea = 10√3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 10√3 cm²."
