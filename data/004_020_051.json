    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the force on the object, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nwhere Work is the work done, Force is the average force applied, Distance is the distance the object is moved, and θ is the angle between the force and the direction of motion. Since the force is parallel to the direction of motion, the angle θ is 0 degrees, and cos(0) = 1.\n\nThe force varies from 2 pounds to 6 pounds, so we need to find the average force:\n\nAverage Force = (Initial Force + Final Force) / 2\nAverage Force = (2 + 6) / 2\nAverage Force = 8 / 2\nAverage Force = 4 pounds\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\nWork = 4 pounds × 15 feet × 1\nWork = 60 foot-pounds\n\nThe work done by the force on the object is 60 foot-pounds."
