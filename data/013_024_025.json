    "message_1": "Problem: \n\nIn a group of 5 volunteers, each of them can contribute a maximum of 10 hours of service to a charity event. They have the option to either contribute 10 hours or no hours at all. If at least 3 volunteers contribute their full 10 hours, the charity event will be a success and each volunteer will receive a reward of $20. However, if less than 3 volunteers contribute their full 10 hours, the event will be a failure and no reward will be given.\n\nAssuming the volunteers are rational and self-interested, what is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies where no volunteer has an incentive to change their decision, given the decisions of the other volunteers.\n\nLet's consider the possible outcomes:\n\n1. If all 5 volunteers contribute 10 hours, the event is a success, and each volunteer receives $20.\n2. If 4 volunteers contribute 10 hours and 1 volunteer contributes 0 hours, the event is a success, and the 4 contributing volunteers receive $20 each, while the non-contributing volunteer receives $0.\n3. If 3 volunteers contribute 10 hours and 2 volunteers contribute 0 hours, the event is a success, and the 3 contributing volunteers receive $20 each, while the 2 non-contributing volunteers receive $0.\n4. If 2 volunteers contribute 10 hours and 3 volunteers contribute 0 hours, the event is a failure, and all volunteers receive $0.\n5. If 1 volunteer contributes 10 hours and 4 volunteers contribute 0 hours, the event is a failure, and all volunteers receive $0.\n6. If all 5 volunteers contribute 0 hours, the event is a failure, and all volunteers receive $0.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when no volunteer has an incentive to change their decision, given the decisions of the other volunteers. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when 3 volunteers contribute 10 hours, and 2 volunteers contribute 0 hours. In this situation, the contributing volunteers receive $20 each, and the non-contributing volunteers receive $0. If any of the contributing volunteers were to change their decision and contribute 0 hours, the event would be a failure, and they would receive $0. Similarly, if any of the non-contributing volunteers were to change their decision and contribute 10 hours, they would still receive $0, as they would be replacing one of the contributing volunteers.\n\nThus, the Nash equilibrium is when 3 volunteers contribute 10 hours, and 2 volunteers contribute 0 hours."
