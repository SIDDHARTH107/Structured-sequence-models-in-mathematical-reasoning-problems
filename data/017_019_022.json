    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. To find the isomorphism classes of each such group, we can use the Sylow theorems and the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nThe prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. Therefore, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9.\n2. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9.\n3. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9.\n4. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9.\n\nNow, we can find the isomorphism classes for each possibility:\n\n1. The Sylow 2-subgroup is either isomorphic to Z_4 or Z_2 x Z_2, and the Sylow 3-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_9. The direct product of these subgroups gives us two non-isomorphic groups: Z_4 x Z_9 and (Z_2 x Z_2) x Z_9.\n\n2. The Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_4, and the Sylow 3-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3. The semidirect product of these subgroups gives us one non-isomorphic group: Z_4 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3.\n\n3. The Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_2, and the Sylow 3-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_9. The semidirect product of these subgroups gives us one non-isomorphic group: (Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_9.\n\n4. This case does not yield any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn conclusion, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36, and their isomorphism classes are Z_4 x Z_9, (Z_2 x Z_2) x Z_9, Z_4 ⋊ Z_3 x Z_3, and (Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_9."
