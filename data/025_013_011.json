    "message_2": "To compute the order of Jac(C)(F), we first need to find the number of points on the curve C over F. We can do this by iterating through all possible x values in GF(7) and checking if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1.\n\nFor each x in GF(7), we compute the right-hand side of the equation:\n\nx = 0: RHS = 0^3 + 2*0 + 1 = 1\nx = 1: RHS = 1^3 + 2*1 + 1 = 4\nx = 2: RHS = 2^3 + 2*2 + 1 = 2\nx = 3: RHS = 3^3 + 2*3 + 1 = 6\nx = 4: RHS = 4^3 + 2*4 + 1 = 6\nx = 5: RHS = 5^3 + 2*5 + 1 = 2\nx = 6: RHS = 6^3 + 2*6 + 1 = 4\n\nNow, we check if there is a y value in GF(7) that satisfies y^2 = RHS:\n\nx = 0: y^2 = 1, y = 1, 6 (2 points)\nx = 1: y^2 = 4, y = 2, 5 (2 points)\nx = 2: y^2 = 2, y = 3, 4 (2 points)\nx = 3: y^2 = 6, y = no solution (0 points)\nx = 4: y^2 = 6, y = no solution (0 points)\nx = 5: y^2 = 2, y = 3, 4 (2 points)\nx = 6: y^2 = 4, y = 2, 5 (2 points)\n\nWe found 10 points on the curve C over F. Additionally, we have the point at infinity, which is always on the curve. So, there are 11 points on C(F).\n\nNow, we compute the order of Jac(C)(F). The Jacobian variety Jac(C) is an abelian variety, and its group of F-rational points Jac(C)(F) is a finite abelian group. By the Hasse-Weil theorem, the order of Jac(C)(F) is approximately equal to the number of points on C(F), which is 11.\n\nTherefore, the order of Jac(C)(F) is 11."
