    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole at z = 2i for f(z), we first factor the numerator:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 4) / (z - 2i)^3 = ((z - 2)(z + 2)) / (z - 2i)^3\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the pole at z = 2i. A pole of order n exists at z = 2i if the function can be written as g(z) / (z - 2i)^n, where g(z) is analytic and nonzero at z = 2i.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the function has a pole of order 3 at z = 2i, since the denominator has a (z - 2i)^3 term and the numerator does not have any (z - 2i) factors that would cancel out the pole.\n\nSo, the order of the pole at z = 2i for f(z) is 3."
