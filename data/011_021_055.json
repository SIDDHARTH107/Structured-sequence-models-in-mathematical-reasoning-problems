    "message_2": "Since the salesman needs to visit the cities in a particular order, we just need to sum up the distances between consecutive cities in that order.\n\nLet's say the order is A → B → C → D → E → F → G. Then the total distance traveled will be:\n\nA to B: 2\nB to C: 4\nC to D: 3\nD to E: 6\nE to F: 1\nF to G: 5\n\nNow, we sum up these distances: 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 5 = 21\n\nThe shortest possible distance the salesman can travel to visit all 7 cities in the given order is 21 units."
