    "message_1": "A Vigenere cipher message has been encrypted using a keyword of length 5. The ciphertext has a character frequency distribution consisting of 20% 'A', 15% 'B', 10% 'C', 30% 'D', and 25% 'E'. If the letter 'E' was the most frequent letter in the original plaintext, determine the length of the keyword used in the encryption.",
    "message_2": "The problem statement already provides the length of the keyword used in the encryption, which is 5."
