    "message_1": "Bob wants to encrypt a message using the block cipher algorithm DES. Each block has a size of 64 bits. If Bob's secret key is 56 bits long, how many possible keys are there for Bob to choose from?",
    "message_2": "Since Bob's secret key is 56 bits long, there are 2^56 possible keys for him to choose from. So, there are 72,057,594,037,927,936 (approximately 72 quadrillion) possible keys."
