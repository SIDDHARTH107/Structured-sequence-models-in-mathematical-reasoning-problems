    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (also called the circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2πr\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven a radius of 4.5 cm, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nC = 2 × 3.14159 × 4.5\n\nC ≈ 28.27431 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle with a radius of 4.5 cm is approximately 28.27 cm."
