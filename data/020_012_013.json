    "message_1": "Here's a question for the math student:\n\nA manufacturing company has a production cost function given by C(x) = 400x + 8000/x, where x is the number of units produced. What is the minimum cost to produce 100 units of the product using global optimization?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost to produce 100 units of the product, we need to find the critical points of the cost function C(x) and then evaluate the cost function at those critical points and the endpoints of the domain. \n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nC(x) = 400x + 8000/x\nC'(x) = d/dx (400x + 8000/x)\n\nUsing the power rule and the chain rule, we get:\nC'(x) = 400 - 8000/x^2\n\nNow, set C'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n0 = 400 - 8000/x^2\n8000/x^2 = 400\nx^2 = 8000/400\nx^2 = 20\nx = ±√20\nx ≈ ±4.47\n\nSince x represents the number of units produced, we can disregard the negative value. Therefore, the critical point is x ≈ 4.47.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the cost function at the critical point and the endpoints of the domain. Since the company wants to produce 100 units, the domain of interest is [1, 100]. The cost function is continuous and differentiable on this interval, so we can apply the global optimization.\n\nEvaluate C(x) at the critical point and the endpoints:\nC(1) = 400(1) + 8000/1 = 400 + 8000 = 8400\nC(4.47) ≈ 400(4.47) + 8000/4.47 ≈ 1788 + 1791.5 = 3579.5\nC(100) = 400(100) + 8000/100 = 40000 + 80 = 40080\n\nComparing the values, we see that the minimum cost occurs at x ≈ 4.47 with a cost of approximately 3579.5. However, this result is not relevant to the problem, as the company wants to produce 100 units, not 4.47 units.\n\nTherefore, the minimum cost to produce 100 units of the product is C(100) = 40,080."
