    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's represent the people with nodes and the relationships between them with edges. If a pair of people know each other, we'll draw a red edge between them; if they don't know each other, we'll draw a blue edge.\n\nConsider a single person (node) in the group. There are 5 other people (nodes) that this person can have a relationship with, so there are 5 edges connected to this node. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 3 of these edges must be the same color, either red or blue. Let's assume, without loss of generality, that there are at least 3 red edges connected to this node.\n\nNow, consider the 3 people (nodes) connected to this person by red edges. If any of these 3 people know each other (i.e., there is a red edge between them), then we have a group of 3 people who all know each other. If none of these 3 people know each other (i.e., there are only blue edges between them), then we have a group of 3 people who all do not know each other.\n\nIn either case, we have found a group of 3 people with the desired property. Since we have considered 1 person and their relationships with 3 other people, we have selected a total of 1 + 3 = 4 pairs of people. Therefore, the smallest number of pairs of people that must be selected is 4."
