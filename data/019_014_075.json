    "message_1": "Given the following two predicates about natural numbers:\n- is_prime(n): True if n is a prime number\n- is_even(n): True if n is an even number\n\nUse higher-order logic to define a new predicate is_prime_and_even(n) that is True if and only if n is both a prime and an even number. Then, prove that 6 is an instance of this new predicate.",
    "message_2": "To define the new predicate is_prime_and_even(n), we can use the logical conjunction (AND) operator to combine the two given predicates is_prime(n) and is_even(n):\n\nis_prime_and_even(n) := is_prime(n) ∧ is_even(n)\n\nNow, we need to prove that 6 is an instance of this new predicate. To do this, we will show that 6 satisfies both the is_prime(n) and is_even(n) predicates.\n\n1. Check if 6 is prime:\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Since 6 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number. Therefore, is_prime(6) is False.\n\n2. Check if 6 is even:\n\nAn even number is a natural number that is divisible by 2. Since 6 is divisible by 2 (6 = 2 * 3), it is an even number. Therefore, is_even(6) is True.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the is_prime_and_even(6) predicate:\n\nis_prime_and_even(6) = is_prime(6) ∧ is_even(6) = False ∧ True = False\n\nThus, 6 is not an instance of the is_prime_and_even(n) predicate, as it is not both prime and even."
