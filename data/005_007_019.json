    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient, we will first need to find the mean of the hours studied and the mean of the grades obtained. Then, we will calculate the covariance and the standard deviations of both variables. Finally, we will divide the covariance by the product of the standard deviations.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of hours studied and grades obtained.\nTotal students = 10 + 8 + 12 = 30\n\nMean of hours studied = (10 * 4 + 8 * 6 + 12 * 5) / 30 = (40 + 48 + 60) / 30 = 148 / 30 = 4.93 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nMean of grades obtained = (10 * 80 + 8 * 90 + 12 * 85) / 30 = (800 + 720 + 1020) / 30 = 2540 / 30 = 84.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the covariance.\nCovariance = Σ[(hours_i - mean_hours) * (grades_i - mean_grades)] / (n - 1)\nwhere hours_i and grades_i are the individual data points, and n is the number of data points.\n\nCovariance = [(4 - 4.93) * (80 - 84.67) * 10 + (6 - 4.93) * (90 - 84.67) * 8 + (5 - 4.93) * (85 - 84.67) * 12] / 29\nCovariance = [-0.93 * -4.67 * 10 + 1.07 * 5.33 * 8 + 0.07 * 0.33 * 12] / 29\nCovariance = (43.41 + 45.37 + 0.28) / 29\nCovariance = 89.06 / 29 = 3.07 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the standard deviations.\nStandard deviation of hours studied = sqrt(Σ(hours_i - mean_hours)^2 / (n - 1))\nStandard deviation of grades obtained = sqrt(Σ(grades_i - mean_grades)^2 / (n - 1))\n\nStandard deviation of hours studied = sqrt([(-0.93)^2 * 10 + (1.07)^2 * 8 + (0.07)^2 * 12] / 29)\nStandard deviation of hours studied = sqrt([8.64 + 9.17 + 0.06] / 29)\nStandard deviation of hours studied = sqrt(17.87 / 29) = sqrt(0.62) = 0.79 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nStandard deviation of grades obtained = sqrt([(-4.67)^2 * 10 + (5.33)^2 * 8 + (0.33)^2 * 12] / 29)\nStandard deviation of grades obtained = sqrt([218.45 + 226.66 + 1.31] / 29)\nStandard deviation of grades obtained = sqrt(446.42 / 29) = sqrt(15.39) = 3.92 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the correlation coefficient.\nCorrelation coefficient (r) = Covariance / (Standard deviation of hours studied * Standard deviation of grades obtained)\nr = 3.07 / (0.79 * 3.92)\nr = 3.07 / 3.10 = 0.99 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the grade obtained by the students is approximately 0.99, which indicates a strong positive relationship between the two variables."
