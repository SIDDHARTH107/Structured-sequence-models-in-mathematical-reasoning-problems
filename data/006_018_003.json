Suppose that in a given year, there is a 10% chance that the company will be targeted by a fraudster. What is the probability that the company will not detect a financial fraud if it is targeted by a fraudster?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that the company is targeted by a fraudster, and B be the event that the company detects the fraud.\n\nWe are given:\n\nP(B|A) = 0.95 (probability of detecting fraud given that the company is targeted)\nP(A) = 0.10 (probability that the company is targeted by a fraudster)\n\nWe want to find P(B' | A), which is the probability of not detecting fraud given that the company is targeted.\n\nUsing the complement rule, we know that P(B' | A) = 1 - P(B | A).\n\nSo, P(B' | A) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05.\n\nThe probability that the company will not detect a financial fraud if it is targeted by a fraudster is 5%."
