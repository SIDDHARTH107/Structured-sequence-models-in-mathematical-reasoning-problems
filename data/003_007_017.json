    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, where a = 5, b = 7, and c is the longest side. The angle opposite to the longest side is given as 120 degrees, which we'll call angle C.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the longest side (c). The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2(5)(7) * cos(120)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 120 degrees. Since cosine is negative in the second quadrant, and cos(180 - 120) = cos(60) = 1/2, we have cos(120) = -1/2.\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nc² = 25 + 49 - 2(5)(7) * (-1/2)\nc² = 25 + 49 + 35\nc² = 109\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the longest side:\n\nc = √109 ≈ 10.44\n\nSo, the length of the longest side (c) is approximately 10.44 units."
