    "message_1": "A factory produces two products P1 and P2. It takes 3 hours to produce one unit of P1 and 2 hours to produce one unit of P2. The factory has 450 hours of production time available each month. The profit margin for P1 is $30 per unit and for P2 it is $20 per unit. The factory wants to maximize its profit. How many units of each product should the factory produce to achieve maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of P1 and y be the number of units of P2. The total production time constraint can be represented as:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 450\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\n\nProfit = 30x + 20y\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraint and then find the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint for y:\n\ny ≤ (450 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region. The feasible region is bounded by the x-axis, y-axis, and the line y = (450 - 3x) / 2.\n\nVertex 1: The intersection of the x-axis and the line y = (450 - 3x) / 2.\nx = 0\ny = (450 - 3(0)) / 2 = 225\n\nVertex 1: (0, 225)\n\nVertex 2: The intersection of the y-axis and the line y = (450 - 3x) / 2.\ny = 0\nx = (450 - 2(0)) / 3 = 150\n\nVertex 2: (150, 0)\n\nVertex 3: The intersection of the x-axis and y-axis.\nx = 0\ny = 0\n\nVertex 3: (0, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nProfit at Vertex 1: 30(0) + 20(225) = $4,500\nProfit at Vertex 2: 30(150) + 20(0) = $4,500\nProfit at Vertex 3: 30(0) + 20(0) = $0\n\nThe maximum profit is $4,500, which can be achieved by producing either 150 units of P1 and 0 units of P2 or 0 units of P1 and 225 units of P2."
