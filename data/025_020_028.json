    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ on the Calabi-Yau variety given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = k$, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new function $g(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - k$ and a new variable $\\lambda$ (the Lagrange multiplier).\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = \\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}$\n4. $g(x, y, z) = 0$\n\nTaking the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n1. $2x = 3\\lambda x^2$\n2. $2y = 3\\lambda y^2$\n3. $2z = 3\\lambda z^2$\n4. $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = k$\n\nNow, let's analyze the first three equations. If $x \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides of the first equation by $x$ and get $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{3x}$. Similarly, if $y \\neq 0$, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{3y}$ from the second equation, and if $z \\neq 0$, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{3z}$ from the third equation.\n\nIf $x = y = z = 0$, then the Calabi-Yau equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = k$ would imply that $k = 0$. However, this is not a Calabi-Yau variety, as it is singular at the origin. Therefore, at least one of $x, y, z$ must be nonzero.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume that $x \\neq 0$. Then, we have $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{3x}$. If $y \\neq 0$, we can equate the expressions for $\\lambda$ and get:\n\n$\\frac{2}{3x} = \\frac{2}{3y} \\Rightarrow x = y$\n\nSimilarly, if $z \\neq 0$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{2}{3x} = \\frac{2}{3z} \\Rightarrow x = z$\n\nThus, if at least two of $x, y, z$ are nonzero, they must be equal. There are three cases to consider:\n\n1. $x = y \\neq 0, z = 0$: In this case, the Calabi-Yau equation becomes $2x^3 = k$, and the critical point is $(x, x, 0)$ with $x = \\sqrt[3]{k/2}$.\n2. $x = z \\neq 0, y = 0$: In this case, the Calabi-Yau equation becomes $2x^3 = k$, and the critical point is $(x, 0, x)$ with $x = \\sqrt[3]{k/2}$.\n3. $y = z \\neq 0, x = 0$: In this case, the Calabi-Yau equation becomes $2y^3 = k$, and the critical point is $(0, y, y)$ with $y = \\sqrt[3]{k/2}$.\n\nTherefore, the critical points of the function $f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ on the Calabi-Yau variety are $(\\sqrt[3]{k/2}, \\sqrt[3]{k/2}, 0)$, $(\\sqrt[3]{k/2}, 0, \\sqrt[3]{k/2})$, and $(0, \\sqrt[3]{k/2}, \\sqrt[3]{k/2})$."
