    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) + cos(x) on the interval [0, π], we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the first derivative of the function with respect to x:\nf'(x) = d(2sin(x) + cos(x))/dx = 2cos(x) - sin(x)\n\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x to find the critical points:\n2cos(x) - sin(x) = 0\nsin(x) = 2cos(x)\nsin(x) / cos(x) = 2\ntan(x) = 2\n\n3. Find the x value(s) that satisfy the equation tan(x) = 2 in the interval [0, π]:\nx = arctan(2) ≈ 1.107 (since arctan(2) is in the first quadrant and within the interval [0, π])\n\n4. Evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval:\nf(0) = 2sin(0) + cos(0) = 0 + 1 = 1\nf(π) = 2sin(π) + cos(π) = 0 - 1 = -1\nf(1.107) ≈ 2sin(1.107) + cos(1.107) ≈ 2.74\n\n5. Compare the function values and determine the maximum value:\nThe maximum value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) + cos(x) on the interval [0, π] is approximately 2.74, which occurs at x ≈ 1.107."
