    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\nSorted edges by weight: (d, c, 1), (a, d, 2), (a, b, 3), (b, c, 4)\n\nNow, let's add the edges one by one:\n\n1. Add edge (d, c, 1) to the minimum spanning tree.\n```\n  (a)    (b)\n         \n         \n  (d)----(c)\n      1\n```\n\n2. Add edge (a, d, 2) to the minimum spanning tree.\n```\n      3\n  (a)----(b)\n   |      \n 2 |      \n   |      \n  (d)----(c)\n      1\n```\n\n3. Add edge (a, b, 3) to the minimum spanning tree. Adding this edge will not form a cycle.\n```\n      3\n  (a)----(b)\n   |      |\n 2 |      | \n   |      |\n  (d)----(c)\n      1\n```\n\n4. We cannot add edge (b, c, 4) to the minimum spanning tree, as it would form a cycle.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete:\n\n```\n      3\n  (a)----(b)\n   |      \n 2 |      \n   |      \n  (d)----(c)\n      1\n```\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6."
