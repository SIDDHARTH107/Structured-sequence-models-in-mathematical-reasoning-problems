Let $u(z,t)$ be defined in the region $0 < |z| < 1$ and $t > 0$, subject to the following conditions:\n$$u(z,0) = \\sin(\\pi |z|^2),$$\n$$u(e^{i\\theta},t) = 0,$$\nfor all $t > 0$ and $\\theta \\in [0,2\\pi]$. Find the solution $u(z,t)$ using complex analysis techniques, and determine the temperature at the point $z = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{i}{2}$ and time $t = 1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use separation of variables and Fourier series techniques. Let's assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on $z$ and the other depending on $t$:\n$$u(z,t) = Z(z)T(t).$$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get\n$$Z(z) \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\alpha T(t) \\frac{d^2Z}{dz^2}.$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $\\alpha Z(z)T(t)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\alpha T(t)} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{Z(z)} \\frac{d^2Z}{dz^2}.$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $z$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\alpha T(t)} \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda^2,$$\n$$\\frac{1}{Z(z)} \\frac{d^2Z}{dz^2} = -\\lambda^2.$$\n\nSolving the first equation for $T(t)$, we get\n$$T(t) = Ce^{-\\alpha \\lambda^2 t},$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant.\n\nSolving the second equation for $Z(z)$, we get\n$$Z(z) = A\\cos(\\lambda z) + B\\sin(\\lambda z),$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions. For $u(e^{i\\theta},t) = 0$, we have\n$$Z(e^{i\\theta})T(t) = 0.$$\n\nSince $T(t)$ is nonzero, we must have $Z(e^{i\\theta}) = 0$. This implies that\n$$A\\cos(\\lambda e^{i\\theta}) + B\\sin(\\lambda e^{i\\theta}) = 0.$$\n\nThis condition is satisfied for all $\\theta$ if $A = 0$ and $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, we have\n$$Z_n(z) = B_n\\sin(n\\pi z),$$\nwhere $B_n$ are constants.\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition $u(z,0) = \\sin(\\pi |z|^2)$. We have\n$$u(z,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin(n\\pi z).$$\n\nComparing this with the given initial condition, we can find the coefficients $B_n$ using the orthogonality of the sine functions. We have\n$$B_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^1 \\sin(\\pi |z|^2)\\sin(n\\pi z) dz.$$\n\nTo find the temperature at the point $z = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{i}{2}$ and time $t = 1$, we first find the modulus of $z$:\n$$|z| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{i}{2}\\right| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.$$\n\nNow, we substitute this value into the initial condition:\n$$u\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1.$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values of $z$ and $t$ into the solution $u(z,t)$:\n$$u\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{i}{2}, 1\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n e^{-\\alpha n^2 \\pi^2} \\sin(n\\pi z).$$\n\nSince we know that $u\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0\\right) = 1$, we can find the temperature at the desired point and time by evaluating the series. However, this series may not have a closed-form expression, so the temperature may need to be approximated numerically."
