    "message_1": "Let A be a set containing 5 elements, and let U be the universal set. If the complement of A has 10 elements, prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "Let A' be the complement of A. By definition, A' contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Since A has 5 elements and A' has 10 elements, there are a total of 5 + 10 = 15 elements in the union of A and A'.\n\nNow, let's consider the union of A and A', denoted by A ∪ A'. By definition, the union of two sets contains all the elements that are in either of the sets. Since A contains all its elements and A' contains all the elements not in A, their union must contain all the elements in the universal set U.\n\nTherefore, A ∪ A' = U, which proves that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
