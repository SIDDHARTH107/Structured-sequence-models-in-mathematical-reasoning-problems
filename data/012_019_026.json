    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn the given graph, we can color the edges as follows:\n\n```\n   1 --- 2 (color 1)\n   |\\   /|\n   | \\ / |\n(color 2) 3 (color 3)\n   | / \\ |\n   |/   \\|\n   4 --- 5 (color 1)\n```\n\nNow, we can see that no two adjacent edges share the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of this graph is 3."
