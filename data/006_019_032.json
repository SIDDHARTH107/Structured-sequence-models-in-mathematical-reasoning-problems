    "message_1": "A survey shows that in a certain country, 75% of the population supports the ruling political party. If a random sample of 100 citizens is taken, what is the probability that at least 70 of them support the ruling political party?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 70 out of 100 citizens support the ruling political party, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of citizens sampled, which is 100)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of citizens supporting the ruling party)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the proportion of the population supporting the ruling party, which is 0.75)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the proportion of the population not supporting the ruling party, which is 0.25)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 70 citizens support the ruling party, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 70 to k = 100:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 70 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = P(X = 70) + P(X = 71) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula for each value of k and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) ≈ 0.9539\n\nSo, the probability that at least 70 out of 100 citizens support the ruling political party is approximately 95.39%."
