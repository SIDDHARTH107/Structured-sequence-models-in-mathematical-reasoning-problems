    "message_1": "Suppose that we start with a straight line segment that is 1 unit long, and we repeatedly replace each line segment with the \"Gosper curve\" (also known as the \"flowsnake\"), which is a fractal shape that consists of repeating patterns of smaller and smaller line segments. After 5 iterations, what is the total length of all the line segments that make up the resulting shape?",
    "message_2": "The Gosper curve is a fractal that is generated by replacing each line segment with a pattern of 7 smaller segments, each of which is 1/√(2) times the length of the original segment. This is because the Gosper curve is formed by connecting two copies of itself at a right angle, and the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with equal sides is √(2) times the length of each side.\n\nAfter each iteration, the total length of the line segments in the shape is multiplied by 7/√(2). Therefore, after 5 iterations, the total length of the line segments in the resulting shape is:\n\n1 * (7/√(2))^5 = 1 * (7^5) / (√(2)^5) = 16807 / 16√(2)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √(2):\n\n(16807√(2)) / (16 * 2) = (16807√(2)) / 32\n\nSo, the total length of all the line segments that make up the resulting shape after 5 iterations is 16807√(2) / 32."
