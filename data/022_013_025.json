    "message_2": "To find the analytic function $f(z)$, we need to check if the given functions $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives of $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -2y$\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 2y$\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 2x$\n\nNow, let's check if the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\Rightarrow 2x = 2x$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\Rightarrow -2y = -2y$\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the given functions $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ represent an analytic function $f(z)$. Therefore, $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 + i(2xy)$.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of $f(z)$, which is given by:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + i\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 2x + i(2y)$\n\nTo find the derivative at $z = 3 + 4i$, we substitute $x = 3$ and $y = 4$:\n\n$f'(3 + 4i) = 2(3) + i(2(4)) = 6 + 8i$\n\nSo, the derivative of $f(z)$ at $z = 3 + 4i$ is $f'(3 + 4i) = 6 + 8i$."
