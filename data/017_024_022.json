    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 96. We want to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. The order of G can be factored as 96 = 2^5 * 3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (denoted by n_2) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup in G, which is 3.\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nThe only number that satisfies these conditions is n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 3. If n_2 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. In this case, G is a semidirect product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and its Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is of order 3, it is isomorphic to C3, the cyclic group of order 3. The Sylow 2-subgroup is of order 32, and there are two possibilities for its isomorphism type: C32 (cyclic) or C16 × C2 (direct product of cyclic groups).\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to C32, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product C32 ⋊ C3. Since C32 has a unique subgroup of order 16, which is normal, the action of C3 on C32 is trivial, and G is isomorphic to the direct product C32 × C3, which is the cyclic group C96.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to C16 × C2, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product (C16 × C2) ⋊ C3. The action of C3 on C16 × C2 can be non-trivial, leading to non-abelian groups. There are 196 non-abelian groups of order 96, and some of them can be realized as semidirect products of this form.\n\nIf n_2 = 3, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G. In this case, G cannot be a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups. However, G can be isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, which has three Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G can be either 1 or 3. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C96 or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, G can be isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2."
