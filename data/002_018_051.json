    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches all six faces of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. In this case, the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm. \n\nThe radius (r) of the sphere is half of the diameter, so r = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume (V) of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3.\n\nSubstituting the value of r into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3 cm)^3 = (4/3)π(27 cm^3) = 36π cm^3 ≈ 113.097 cm^3.\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube with an edge length of 6 cm is approximately 113.097 cm^3."
