    "message_1": "In a centipede game, there are two players, A and B, and a pot of money worth $100. Player A can either pass the pot to player B, giving up $10, or keep the pot and gain $90. If player A passes the pot to player B, player B can then pass it back to player A, giving up $20 or keep the pot and gain $80. If player B passes the pot back to player A, the game continues in the same fashion. What will each player choose if the game reaches the 5th round (i.e. the pot has been passed back and forth four times)?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the game round by round:\n\n1st round: Player A has the choice to pass the pot to player B, giving up $10, or keep the pot and gain $90.\n\n2nd round: If player A passes the pot to player B, player B can pass it back to player A, giving up $20, or keep the pot and gain $80.\n\n3rd round: If player B passes the pot back to player A, player A can pass the pot to player B, giving up $30, or keep the pot and gain $70.\n\n4th round: If player A passes the pot to player B, player B can pass it back to player A, giving up $40, or keep the pot and gain $60.\n\n5th round: If player B passes the pot back to player A, player A can pass the pot to player B, giving up $50, or keep the pot and gain $50.\n\nAt the 5th round, player A has no incentive to pass the pot to player B, as they would gain the same amount ($50) by keeping the pot. Therefore, player A will choose to keep the pot and gain $50.\n\nSince player B knows that player A will keep the pot in the 5th round, player B has no incentive to pass the pot back to player A in the 4th round. Instead, player B will choose to keep the pot and gain $60.\n\nSimilarly, player A knows that player B will keep the pot in the 4th round, so player A has no incentive to pass the pot to player B in the 3rd round. Player A will choose to keep the pot and gain $70.\n\nFollowing this logic, both players will choose to keep the pot in each round, as they know that the other player will not pass the pot back to them. In the end, player A will keep the pot and gain $90 in the 1st round, and player B will not have any gain."
