    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length measuring 12 cm each. If the base of the triangle is 9 cm, what is the length of the remaining side?",
    "message_2": "Since the triangle is isosceles, the two equal sides are the legs of the triangle, and the base is the third side. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the remaining side.\n\nLet's call the length of the remaining side x. We can split the isosceles triangle into two right triangles by drawing an altitude from the vertex angle to the midpoint of the base. The altitude will be perpendicular to the base and will bisect it, creating two right triangles with legs of length 4.5 cm (half of the base) and x/2 (half of the remaining side).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n(12)^2 = (4.5)^2 + (x/2)^2\n\n144 = 20.25 + (x^2)/4\n\nTo solve for x^2, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n576 = 81 + x^2\n\nNow, subtract 81 from both sides:\n\n495 = x^2\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides:\n\nx = √495 ≈ 22.25 cm\n\nSo, the length of the remaining side is approximately 22.25 cm."
