    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, product A and B, which must be processed on two machines, machine M1 and M2. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours on machine M1 and 1 hour on machine M2. Each unit of product B requires 1 hour on machine M1 and 3 hours on machine M2. Machine M1 can be operated for at most 80 hours per week, and machine M2 can be operated for at most 70 hours per week. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and the profit per unit of product B is $12. Find the optimal production quantity of product A and B that will maximize the total profit of the company per week subject to the constraints of machine hours per week.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced per week. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented by the equation:\n\nTotal Profit = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints of machine hours per week:\n\n2x + y ≤ 80 (Machine M1 constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 70 (Machine M2 constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity of product A and B, we will use the graphical method to solve this linear programming problem.\n\n1. Plot the constraint inequalities on a graph:\n\n2x + y ≤ 80\ny ≤ -2x + 80\n\nx + 3y ≤ 70\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 70/3\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\n2. Identify the feasible region, which is the area where all constraints are satisfied.\n\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraint lines intersect:\n\n(0, 0) - Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0\n(0, 23.33) - Intersection of y = 0 and y = (-1/3)x + 70/3\n(30, 20) - Intersection of 2x + y = 80 and x + 3y = 70\n(40, 0) - Intersection of x = 0 and 2x + y = 80\n\n4. Evaluate the objective function (Total Profit = 10x + 12y) at each vertex:\n\n(0, 0): Total Profit = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\n(0, 23.33): Total Profit = 10(0) + 12(23.33) = $279.96\n(30, 20): Total Profit = 10(30) + 12(20) = $540\n(40, 0): Total Profit = 10(40) + 12(0) = $400\n\n5. Choose the vertex with the highest total profit:\n\nThe optimal production quantity is at the vertex (30, 20), with a total profit of $540 per week. Therefore, the company should produce 30 units of product A and 20 units of product B per week to maximize their total profit."
