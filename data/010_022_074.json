    "message_1": "Consider a torus (donut-shaped solid in 3D space) with major radius of 3 cm and minor radius of 1 cm. Suppose a sphere with radius of 2 cm is in contact with the torus at a point on the outer surface. Find the point of contact on the torus surface.",
    "message_2": "Let's use a coordinate system to describe the torus and the sphere. We'll place the torus centered at the origin with the hole of the torus aligned with the z-axis. The parametric equation for the torus is given by:\n\nx(u, v) = (3 + 1 * cos(v)) * cos(u)\ny(u, v) = (3 + 1 * cos(v)) * sin(u)\nz(u, v) = 1 * sin(v)\n\nwhere u and v are parameters in the range [0, 2π).\n\nNow, let's consider the sphere. Since the sphere has a radius of 2 cm and is in contact with the torus at a point on the outer surface, the center of the sphere must be located on the x-y plane (z = 0) and at a distance of 5 cm from the origin (3 cm major radius + 2 cm sphere radius). Let's call this point P.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume that the center of the sphere is at point P(5, 0, 0). Then, the equation of the sphere is given by:\n\n(x - 5)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2\n\nNow, we need to find the point of contact between the torus and the sphere. Let's call this point Q. Since Q lies on both the torus and the sphere, we can set the equations equal to each other:\n\nx(u, v) = x\ny(u, v) = y\nz(u, v) = z\n\nSubstituting the parametric equations of the torus into the equation of the sphere:\n\n((3 + cos(v)) * cos(u) - 5)^2 + ((3 + cos(v)) * sin(u))^2 + (sin(v))^2 = 4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of u and v that satisfy this equation. Since the sphere is tangent to the torus, the normal vector of the torus at point Q must be parallel to the vector from the center of the sphere to point Q.\n\nThe normal vector of the torus at point Q is given by the cross product of the partial derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to u and v:\n\nN(u, v) = ∂(x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v))/∂u × ∂(x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v))/∂v\n\nThe vector from the center of the sphere to point Q is given by:\n\nV = (x(u, v) - 5, y(u, v), z(u, v))\n\nNow, we need to find the values of u and v such that N(u, v) is parallel to V. This means that the cross product of N(u, v) and V is zero:\n\nN(u, v) × V = 0\n\nAfter solving this system of equations, we find that the point of contact Q is at:\n\nu = π\nv = 0\n\nSubstituting these values into the parametric equations of the torus:\n\nx(π, 0) = (3 + 1 * cos(0)) * cos(π) = 4\ny(π, 0) = (3 + 1 * cos(0)) * sin(π) = 0\nz(π, 0) = 1 * sin(0) = 0\n\nSo, the point of contact between the torus and the sphere is Q(4, 0, 0)."
