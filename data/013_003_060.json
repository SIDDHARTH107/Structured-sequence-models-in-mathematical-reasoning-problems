    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, a proposer must offer a division of $50 between themselves and a responder. If the responder accepts the division, they each receive their respective shares. But if the responder rejects the division, neither player receives any money. Assuming both players are rational and care only about maximizing their own payoff, what is the smallest amount the proposer can offer and still expect the responder to accept the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, if both players are rational and care only about maximizing their own payoff, the proposer should offer the smallest possible amount greater than $0 to the responder. This is because the responder, being rational, would prefer to accept any amount greater than $0 rather than rejecting the offer and receiving nothing.\n\nSo, the smallest amount the proposer can offer and still expect the responder to accept the offer is $0.01 (1 cent), assuming the division can be made in cents. The proposer would keep $49.99, and the responder would get $0.01."
