    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can start by expressing 125 as a power of 5 since the base on the left side of the equation is 5. We know that 5^3 = 125. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n5^(x-1) = 5^3\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx - 1 = 3\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 3 + 1\nx = 4"
