    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 18 and 27, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 18: 2 × 3²\nPrime factorization of 27: 3³\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor and multiply them together:\n\nLCM(18, 27) = 2 × 3³ = 2 × 27 = 54\n\nSo, the LCM of 18 and 27 is 54."
