    "message_2": "To find the intersection of set A and set B, we need to find the elements that are common to both sets. \n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nB = {4, 8, 12, 16}\n\nThe common elements in both sets are 4 and 8. Therefore, the intersection of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the intersection is a subset of both sets A and B. To do this, we need to show that every element in the intersection is also an element of both sets A and B.\n\nLet's take the elements of A ∩ B one by one:\n\n1. 4 is an element of A ∩ B. It is also an element of set A (since 4 is in A) and an element of set B (since 4 is in B).\n\n2. 8 is an element of A ∩ B. It is also an element of set A (since 8 is in A) and an element of set B (since 8 is in B).\n\nSince every element of A ∩ B is also an element of both sets A and B, we can conclude that the intersection A ∩ B is a subset of both sets A and B."
