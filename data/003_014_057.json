    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function y = 2sin(3x), we need to identify the values of A, B, and C in the general sine function form: y = A*sin(Bx + C).\n\nIn this case, we have:\nA = 2\nB = 3\nC = 0\n\n1. Amplitude:\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is the coefficient of the sine function. It determines the height of the wave from the midline.\nAmplitude = |A| = |2| = 2\n\n2. Period:\nThe period is the length of one complete cycle of the sine wave. It is determined by the value of B and can be calculated using the formula:\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\nPeriod = (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3\n\n3. Phase Shift:\nThe phase shift is the horizontal shift of the graph and is determined by the value of C. It can be calculated using the formula:\nPhase Shift = -C / B\nSince C = 0 in this case, there is no phase shift:\nPhase Shift = -0 / 3 = 0\n\nSo, for the function y = 2sin(3x), the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π)/3, and there is no phase shift."
