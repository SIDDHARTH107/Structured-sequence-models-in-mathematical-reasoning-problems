    "message_2": "We will use the Pigeonhole Principle to prove this statement. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes and n+1 pigeons, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this social network, there are 15 people, so each person can have a minimum of 0 friends and a maximum of 14 friends. However, we are given that each person has at least 3 friends, so the minimum number of friends is 3. Therefore, the possible number of friends a person can have is 3, 4, 5, ..., 14, which is a total of 12 possible values.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of friends as pigeonholes, and the people as pigeons. Since there are 15 people (pigeons) and only 12 possible values for the number of friends (pigeonholes), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one pigeonhole (number of friends) that contains more than one pigeon (person). \n\nIn other words, there must be at least two people who have exactly the same number of friends in the network."
