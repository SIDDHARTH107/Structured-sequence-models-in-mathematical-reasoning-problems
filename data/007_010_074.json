What is the largest number of animals the farmer can sell in each group? Use the Chinese remainder theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this problem. Let x be the number of animals in each group. We want to find the largest x that satisfies the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 0 (mod 101)\nx ≡ 0 (mod 102)\nx ≡ 0 (mod 103)\n\nFirst, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the moduli (101, 102, and 103). Since these numbers are all prime, their LCM is simply their product:\n\nLCM(101, 102, 103) = 101 * 102 * 103 = 1061206\n\nNow, we want to find the largest divisor of 1061206 that divides the number of each type of animal. The prime factorization of 1061206 is:\n\n1061206 = 2 * 3 * 101 * 103\n\nSince the farmer has 101 chickens, 102 ducks, and 103 pigs, we can see that the largest divisor of 1061206 that divides the number of each type of animal is:\n\nx = 2 * 3 * 101 = 606\n\nSo, the largest number of animals the farmer can sell in each group is 606."
