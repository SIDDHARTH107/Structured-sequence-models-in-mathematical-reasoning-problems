A × (B ∪ {4})\nFirst, we find the union of B and {4}:\nB ∪ {4} = {3, 4}\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∪ {4}):\nA × (B ∪ {4}) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\n3. (A ∪ {4}) × B\nFirst, we find the union of A and {4}:\nA ∪ {4} = {1, 2, 4}\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of (A ∪ {4}) and B:\n(A ∪ {4}) × B = {(1,3), (2,3), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is associative with respect to the union operation:\n\n(A × B) ∪ {4} = {(1,3), (2,3), 4}\nA × (B ∪ {4}) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n(A ∪ {4}) × B = {(1,3), (2,3), (4,3)}\n\nAs we can see, the results of the three sets are different. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to the union operation."
