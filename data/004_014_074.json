    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid formed when the cone is rotated around its axis, we can use the method of disks. We will integrate the area of the disks along the height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the equation for the radius of the cone at any given height. Since the cone has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 6 cm, we can use similar triangles to find the equation for the radius at any height y:\n\nr(y) = (4/6) * y\n\nNow, we can find the area of a disk at height y:\n\nA(y) = π * r(y)^2 = π * ((4/6) * y)^2 = (16π/36) * y^2 = (4π/9) * y^2\n\nNow, we can integrate A(y) along the height of the cone from 0 to 6 to find the volume:\n\nV = ∫[0, 6] A(y) dy = ∫[0, 6] (4π/9) * y^2 dy\n\nTo integrate, we can use the power rule:\n\nV = (4π/9) * (1/3) * y^3 | [0, 6]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\nV = (4π/9) * (1/3) * (6^3 - 0^3) = (4π/9) * (1/3) * 216 = 288π/9 = 32π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the solid formed when the cone is rotated around its axis is 32π cm^3."
