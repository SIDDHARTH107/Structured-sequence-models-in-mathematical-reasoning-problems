    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at point (1,1,2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nThe gradient of the surface is given by:\n∇z = (dz/dx, dz/dy) = (2x, 2y)\n\nAt point (1,1,2), the gradient is:\n∇z(1,1,2) = (2, 2)\n\nNow, we find the unit normal vector N:\nN = ∇z / ||∇z||\nN = (2, 2, -1) / sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2)\nN = (2, 2, -1) / sqrt(9)\nN = (2/3, 2/3, -1/3)\n\nNext, we compute the second derivatives of z:\nd^2z/dx^2 = 2\nd^2z/dy^2 = 2\nd^2z/dxdy = 0\n\nNow, we compute the components of the second fundamental form:\nL = N • (d^2z/dx^2) = (2/3, 2/3, -1/3) • (2, 0, 0) = 4/3\nM = N • (d^2z/dxdy) = (2/3, 2/3, -1/3) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\nN = N • (d^2z/dy^2) = (2/3, 2/3, -1/3) • (0, 2, 0) = 4/3\n\nFinally, we compute the Gaussian curvature K:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nFor the first fundamental form, we have:\nE = 1 + (dz/dx)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5\nF = (dz/dx)(dz/dy) = 0\nG = 1 + (dz/dy)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature K is:\nK = (4/3 * 4/3 - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - 0^2) = (16/9) / 25 = 16 / 225\n\nTherefore, the Gaussian curvature at point (1,1,2) is 16/225."
