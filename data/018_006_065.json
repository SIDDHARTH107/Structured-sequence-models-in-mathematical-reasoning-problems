    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set and A be a subset of U. If |U| = 50 and |A| = 25, what is the cardinality of A' ∪ A, where A' is the complement of A? Verify if it is equal to |U|.",
    "message_2": "A' is the complement of A, which means it contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since |U| = 50 and |A| = 25, there are 50 - 25 = 25 elements in A'.\n\nNow, we need to find the cardinality of A' ∪ A. The union of two sets contains all the elements that are in either of the sets. Since A and A' are disjoint sets (they don't have any common elements), the cardinality of their union is simply the sum of their individual cardinalities.\n\nSo, |A' ∪ A| = |A'| + |A| = 25 + 25 = 50.\n\nSince |A' ∪ A| = 50 and |U| = 50, we can conclude that A' ∪ A is equal to U."
