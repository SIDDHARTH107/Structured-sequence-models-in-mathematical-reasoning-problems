    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector u onto vector v, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection of u onto v = (u • v) / ||v||\n\nwhere \"u • v\" is the dot product of the two vectors, and \"||v||\" is the magnitude of vector v.\n\nFirst, let's find the components of vectors u and v:\n\nu_x = ||u|| * cos(35°) = 8 * cos(35°)\nu_y = ||u|| * sin(35°) = 8 * sin(35°)\n\nv_x = ||v|| * cos(100°) = 5 * cos(100°)\nv_y = ||v|| * sin(100°) = 5 * sin(100°)\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu • v = u_x * v_x + u_y * v_y\nu • v = (8 * cos(35°)) * (5 * cos(100°)) + (8 * sin(35°)) * (5 * sin(100°))\n\nNow, let's divide the dot product by the magnitude of vector v:\n\nprojection of u onto v = (u • v) / ||v||\nprojection of u onto v = ((8 * cos(35°)) * (5 * cos(100°)) + (8 * sin(35°)) * (5 * sin(100°))) / 5\n\nprojection of u onto v = (8 * cos(35°) * cos(100°) + 8 * sin(35°) * sin(100°))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for the trigonometric functions:\n\nprojection of u onto v ≈ (8 * 0.8192 * (-0.1736) + 8 * 0.5736 * 0.9848)\nprojection of u onto v ≈ (-1.1352 + 4.5232)\nprojection of u onto v ≈ 3.388\n\nTherefore, the projection of vector u onto vector v is approximately 3.388 units."
