    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 2^(x-1) = 16, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation in terms of the same base:\nSince 16 can be written as 2^4, we can rewrite the equation as:\n2^(x-1) = 2^4\n\n2. Set the exponents equal to each other:\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\nx - 1 = 4\n\n3. Solve for x:\nAdd 1 to both sides of the equation:\nx = 4 + 1\nx = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation 2^(x-1) = 16 is x = 5."
