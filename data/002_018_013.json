    "message_2": "To find the volume of the sphere, we first need to find its radius. Since the cube is inscribed inside the sphere, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the cube.\n\nThe space diagonal of a cube with side length s can be found using the formula:\n\nSpace diagonal = √(s² + s² + s²)\n\nIn this case, s = 6 cm. So,\n\nSpace diagonal = √(6² + 6² + 6²) = √(36 + 36 + 36) = √108 ≈ 10.39 cm\n\nSince the space diagonal is the diameter of the sphere, the radius of the sphere is half of the space diagonal:\n\nRadius = 10.39 cm / 2 ≈ 5.195 cm\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr³\n\nVolume ≈ (4/3)π(5.195)³ ≈ (4/3)π(139.64) ≈ 185.72π cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 185.72π cm³ or approximately 583.34 cm³."
