    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+5) - log(x-3) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this property to the given equation, we get:\n\nlog((x+5)/(x-3)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log(a) = b, then a = 10^b. Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\n(x+5)/(x-3) = 10^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(x+5)/(x-3) = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\nx + 5 = 100(x - 3)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx + 5 = 100x - 300\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n5 = 99x - 300\n\nAdd 300 to both sides:\n\n305 = 99x\n\nFinally, divide by 99:\n\nx = 305/99\n\nx â‰ˆ 3.08"
