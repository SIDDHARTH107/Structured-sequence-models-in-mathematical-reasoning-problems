    "message_2": "To determine if the system is stable or unstable, we first need to find the transfer function of the system using the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{y''\\} + 4\\mathcal{F}\\{y'\\} + 5\\mathcal{F}\\{y\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{-t}\\}$$\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we have:\n\n$$(j\\omega)^2Y(j\\omega) + 4(j\\omega)Y(j\\omega) + 5Y(j\\omega) = \\frac{1}{1+j\\omega}$$\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function, H(jω), which is the ratio of the output Y(jω) to the input X(jω):\n\n$$H(j\\omega) = \\frac{Y(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{(j\\omega)^2 + 4(j\\omega) + 5}$$\n\nTo determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function. The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator of the transfer function is zero:\n\n$$(j\\omega)^2 + 4(j\\omega) + 5 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of jω. We can find the roots using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$j\\omega = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}$$\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\n$$j\\omega = -2 \\pm j$$\n\nThe real part of the roots is negative, which means the system is stable. In general, a system is stable if all the poles of its transfer function have negative real parts. In this case, the given system is stable."
