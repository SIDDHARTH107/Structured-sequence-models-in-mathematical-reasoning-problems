    "message_2": "Let X be a Fano variety of dimension 3 with Picard number 1. Let P and Q be two general points on X. We want to find the number of lines that pass through both P and Q.\n\nConsider the incidence correspondence I ⊂ X × X × G(1,3), where G(1,3) is the Grassmannian of lines in P^3. The incidence correspondence is defined as:\n\nI = {(x, y, L) ∈ X × X × G(1,3) | x, y ∈ L}\n\nLet π₁: I → X × X and π₂: I → G(1,3) be the projections onto the first and second factors, respectively. We have the following diagram:\n\nI --(π₂)--> G(1,3)\n|            |\n(π₁)          |\nv            v\nX × X\n\nNow, let's consider the fiber of π₁ over (P, Q), which is the set of lines passing through both P and Q:\n\nF = π₁^(-1)(P, Q) = {L ∈ G(1,3) | P, Q ∈ L}\n\nSince X is a Fano variety, it is rationally connected, which means that there is a rational curve connecting any two general points. In particular, there is at least one line connecting P and Q.\n\nNow, we want to compute the dimension of F. The dimension of G(1,3) is 4, and the dimension of X × X is 6. By the fiber dimension theorem, we have:\n\ndim(F) = dim(I) - dim(X × X) = dim(G(1,3)) - dim(X) = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nThus, F is a one-dimensional variety. Since F is a finite union of lines, it must consist of a finite number of lines. Let's denote this number by N.\n\nNow, we compute the degree of π₂ restricted to I. Since X is a Fano variety of dimension 3 with Picard number 1, it has a very ample line bundle L such that the anticanonical bundle is given by -K_X = 4L. The degree of π₂ restricted to I is given by the intersection number:\n\ndeg(π₂|_I) = (π₂^*([pt])) · [I] = (4L)³ = 64\n\nFinally, we use the fact that the degree of π₂ restricted to I is equal to the sum of the degrees of the fibers of π₁:\n\ndeg(π₂|_I) = ∑ deg(F) = N * deg(F)\n\nSince F is a one-dimensional variety consisting of lines, deg(F) = 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n64 = N * 1\n\nThus, N = 64. There are 64 lines that pass through two general points on a Fano variety of dimension 3 with Picard number 1."
