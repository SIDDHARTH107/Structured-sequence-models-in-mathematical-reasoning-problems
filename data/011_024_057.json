Each factory produces a certain number of widgets, and each warehouse has a certain demand for widgets. The transportation cost per widget is given in the following table. What is the minimum cost to transport all the widgets? \n\n|      | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 | W5 | W6 |\n|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| F1   | 10 | 7  | 1  | 15 | 25 | 5  |\n| F2   | 2  | 14 | 9  | 21 | 8  | 7  |\n| F3   | 6  | 11 | 12 | 9  | 16 | 10 |\n| F4   | 22 | 3  | 13 | 5  | 7  | 9  |\n| Demand | 25 | 20 | 10 | 5  | 15 | 15 | \n\nNote: The transportation cost represents the cost to transport one widget from a factory to a warehouse.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost to transport all the widgets, we can use the transportation algorithm. First, we need to find the supply from each factory and the demand for each warehouse.\n\nLet's assume the supply from each factory is as follows:\n\nF1: 40 widgets\nF2: 30 widgets\nF3: 20 widgets\nF4: 10 widgets\n\nNow, we can start allocating the widgets to warehouses with the lowest transportation cost.\n\n1. The lowest cost is 1 (F1 to W3). Allocate 10 widgets (W3's demand) from F1 to W3. Now, F1 has 30 widgets left, and W3's demand is fulfilled.\n\n2. The next lowest cost is 2 (F2 to W1). Allocate 25 widgets (W1's demand) from F2 to W1. Now, F2 has 5 widgets left, and W1's demand is fulfilled.\n\n3. The next lowest cost is 3 (F4 to W2). Allocate 10 widgets from F4 to W2. Now, F4 has no widgets left, and W2 has 10 widgets demand left.\n\n4. The next lowest cost is 5 (F1 to W6). Allocate 15 widgets (W6's demand) from F1 to W6. Now, F1 has 15 widgets left, and W6's demand is fulfilled.\n\n5. The next lowest cost is 5 (F4 to W5). However, F4 has no widgets left, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n6. The next lowest cost is 6 (F3 to W1). Allocate 15 widgets from F3 to W1. Now, F3 has 5 widgets left, and W1's demand is fulfilled.\n\n7. The next lowest cost is 7 (F1 to W2). Allocate 10 widgets (W2's remaining demand) from F1 to W2. Now, F1 has 5 widgets left, and W2's demand is fulfilled.\n\n8. The next lowest cost is 7 (F2 to W6). However, W6's demand is already fulfilled, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n9. The next lowest cost is 7 (F4 to W6). However, F4 has no widgets left, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n10. The next lowest cost is 8 (F2 to W5). Allocate 5 widgets (F2's remaining supply) to W5. Now, F2 has no widgets left, and W5 has 10 widgets demand left.\n\n11. The next lowest cost is 9 (F3 to W4). Allocate 5 widgets (W4's demand) from F3 to W4. Now, F3 has no widgets left, and W4's demand is fulfilled.\n\n12. The next lowest cost is 10 (F3 to W6). However, F3 has no widgets left, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n13. The next lowest cost is 10 (F1 to W6). However, W6's demand is already fulfilled, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n14. The next lowest cost is 11 (F3 to W2). However, F3 has no widgets left, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n15. The next lowest cost is 12 (F3 to W3). However, F3 has no widgets left, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n16. The next lowest cost is 13 (F4 to W3). However, F4 has no widgets left, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n17. The next lowest cost is 15 (F1 to W4). However, W4's demand is already fulfilled, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n18. The next lowest cost is 15 (F1 to W5). Allocate 5 widgets (F1's remaining supply) to W5. Now, F1 has no widgets left, and W5 has 5 widgets demand left.\n\n19. The next lowest cost is 16 (F3 to W5). However, F3 has no widgets left, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n20. The next lowest cost is 25 (F1 to W5). However, F1 has no widgets left, so we move on to the next lowest cost.\n\n21. The next lowest cost is 25 (F5 to W5). Allocate 5 widgets (W5's remaining demand) from F5 to W5. Now, W5's demand is fulfilled.\n\nNow, all the demands are fulfilled, and we can calculate the total transportation cost:\n\n(10 * 1) + (25 * 2) + (10 * 3) + (15 * 5) + (15 * 6) + (10 * 7) + (5 * 8) + (5 * 9) + (5 * 15) + (5 * 25) = 10 + 50 + 30 + 75 + 90 + 70 + 40 + 45 + 75 + 125 = 610\n\nThe minimum cost to transport all the widgets is 610."
