    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one light bulb is defective, it's easier to first find the probability that none of them are defective and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single light bulb is not defective is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the light bulbs are independent events, the probability that all 20 light bulbs are not defective is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one light bulb is defective, we subtract the probability that none are defective from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415\n\nSo, the probability that at least one light bulb is defective in a pack of 20 is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
