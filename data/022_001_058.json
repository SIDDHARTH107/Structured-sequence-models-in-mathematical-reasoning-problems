    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\sqrt{z-1}$ along the path $z(t) = t^2 + 1$, we first need to parametrize the path and then substitute it into the function.\n\nThe path is given by $z(t) = t^2 + 1$. We want to find $f(z(t))$:\n\n$$\nf(z(t)) = \\sqrt{z(t) - 1} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 1 - 1} = \\sqrt{t^2}.\n$$\n\nNow, we need to be careful with the square root function, as it has two branches. Since we are starting at $z(0) = 1$, we choose the positive branch of the square root:\n\n$$\nf(z(t)) = \\sqrt{t^2} = |t|.\n$$\n\nThis is the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\sqrt{z-1}$ along the path $z(t) = t^2 + 1$ starting at $z(0) = 1$."
