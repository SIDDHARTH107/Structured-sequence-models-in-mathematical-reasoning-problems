    "message_2": "To determine the frequency domain representation of the signal, we will apply the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the sampled signal. The DFT is given by:\n\nX(k) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * n / N)]\n\nwhere X(k) is the k-th frequency component, x(n) is the n-th sample of the time-domain signal, N is the total number of samples, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn this case, the signal is a 100 Hz sinusoid, which can be represented as:\n\nx(t) = A * sin(2 * π * 100 * t)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the signal and t is the time variable.\n\nSince the signal is sampled at a rate of 500 samples per second, the time interval between samples is:\n\nΔt = 1 / 500 s\n\nThe sampled signal can be represented as:\n\nx(n) = A * sin(2 * π * 100 * n * Δt)\n\nNow, we can apply the DFT to the sampled signal:\n\nX(k) = Σ [A * sin(2 * π * 100 * n * Δt) * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * n / N)]\n\nSince we don't have a specific number of samples (N) or amplitude (A), we can't compute the exact DFT. However, we can analyze the frequency domain representation qualitatively.\n\nThe frequency domain representation will have a peak at the frequency of the sinusoid (100 Hz) and its harmonics (integer multiples of 100 Hz). The amplitude of the peak will depend on the amplitude of the time-domain signal (A). Additionally, due to the sampling rate of 500 samples per second, the frequency domain representation will be periodic with a period of 500 Hz (the Nyquist frequency is 250 Hz).\n\nIn summary, the frequency domain representation of the 100 Hz signal sampled at 500 samples per second will have a peak at 100 Hz and its harmonics, with the amplitude of the peak depending on the amplitude of the time-domain signal. The frequency domain representation will be periodic with a period of 500 Hz."
