    "message_2": "To compute the Fourier transform of a 256x256 image using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, we need to perform a 2D FFT. The 2D FFT can be computed by applying the 1D FFT on each row and then on each column of the image.\n\nThe 1D FFT of size N requires N/2*log2(N) complex multiplications. In our case, N = 256, so the number of complex multiplications for a single 1D FFT is:\n\n(256/2) * log2(256) = 128 * 8 = 1024 complex multiplications.\n\nNow, we need to perform the 1D FFT on each row and each column of the image. Since there are 256 rows and 256 columns, the total number of complex multiplications for the 2D FFT is:\n\n(256 * 1024) + (256 * 1024) = 524288 complex multiplications.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the 256x256 image using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm requires 524,288 complex multiplications."
