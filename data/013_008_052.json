    "message_1": "Consider a group of 10 people who decide to contribute money towards a public good. They each have an initial endowment of $100. If they all decide to contribute the same amount to the public good, what is the maximum amount they can contribute to the public good to maximize the common benefit? Assume that the benefit to all contributors is the sum of their individual contributions. Also assume that any money left unspent is returned to the contributors.",
    "message_2": "Since there are 10 people and each has an initial endowment of $100, the total amount of money available for contribution is 10 * $100 = $1000. If they all contribute the same amount, the maximum they can contribute to maximize the common benefit would be the entire sum of their endowments, which is $1000. This is because the benefit to all contributors is the sum of their individual contributions, and contributing the entire sum would maximize the overall benefit."
