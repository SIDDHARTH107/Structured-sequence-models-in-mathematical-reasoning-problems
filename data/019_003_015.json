    "message_1": "Here is an example of a numerical problem in Modal Logic:\n\nLet p and q be propositional variables that can represent \"It is sunny\" and \"It is raining\", respectively. Given the formula □(p → q) → (□p → □q), prove that the statement \"If it is always the case that when it is sunny it rains, then if it is always the case that it is sunny, it is always the case that it rains\" is true.\n\nNote: □ is the modal operator for \"necessarily\" or \"always\".",
    "message_2": "To prove the given statement, we will use the rules of modal logic. We are given the formula:\n\n□(p → q) → (□p → □q)\n\nWe want to show that if it is always the case that when it is sunny it rains (□(p → q)), then if it is always the case that it is sunny (□p), it is always the case that it rains (□q).\n\nAssume that it is always the case that when it is sunny it rains:\n\n1. □(p → q) (Assumption)\n\nNow, assume that it is always the case that it is sunny:\n\n2. □p (Assumption)\n\nSince we have assumed both □(p → q) and □p, we can use the rule of necessitation, which states that if A is true, then □A is true. In this case, we have:\n\n3. □(p → q) ∧ □p (Conjunction of 1 and 2)\n\nNow, we can use the rule of distribution, which states that □(A ∧ B) → (□A ∧ □B). In this case, we have:\n\n4. □((p → q) ∧ p) (Distribution of 3)\n\nUsing the rule of modus ponens, which states that if A and (A → B) are true, then B is true, we can derive:\n\n5. □q (Modus ponens applied to 4)\n\nSo, we have shown that if it is always the case that when it is sunny it rains (□(p → q)), and if it is always the case that it is sunny (□p), then it is always the case that it rains (□q). Therefore, the given statement is true."
