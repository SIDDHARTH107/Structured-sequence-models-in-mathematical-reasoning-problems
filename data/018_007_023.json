    "message_2": "Given that |A| = 3, the power set of A, P(A), contains all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. The number of elements in the power set is given by the formula |P(A)| = 2^|A|.\n\nSo, |P(A)| = 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow, we need to calculate |P(A)| - |A|:\n\n|P(A)| - |A| = 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the value of |P(A)| - |A| is 5."
