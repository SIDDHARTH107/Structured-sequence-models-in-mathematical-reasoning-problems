    "message_2": "1. To determine whether {3} is an open set in X, we need to check if it is included in the given list of open sets. The given open sets are {}, {1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, and {1, 2, 3, 4}. Since {3} is not in this list, it is not an open set in X.\n\n2. To determine whether {2} and {2, 3} are closed sets in X, we need to check if their complements are open sets. The complement of a set A in X is the set of all elements in X that are not in A.\n\n- The complement of {2} in X is {1, 3, 4}. This set is not in the list of open sets, so {2} is not a closed set in X.\n\n- The complement of {2, 3} in X is {1, 4}. This set is also not in the list of open sets, so {2, 3} is not a closed set in X."
