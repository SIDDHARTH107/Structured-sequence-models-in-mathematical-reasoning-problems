    "message_2": "Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can find the number of students who like either football or basketball or both. \n\nNumber of students who like football (F) = 60\nNumber of students who like basketball (B) = 40\nNumber of students who like both football and basketball (F ∩ B) = 30\n\nNumber of students who like either football or basketball (F ∪ B) = Number of students who like football + Number of students who like basketball - Number of students who like both\n\nF ∪ B = 60 + 40 - 30\nF ∪ B = 100 - 30\nF ∪ B = 70\n\nNow, we have the total number of students who like either football or basketball. To find the number of students who do not like either game, we subtract this number from the total number of students in the school.\n\nNumber of students who do not like either game = Total number of students - Number of students who like either game\n\nNumber of students who do not like either game = 100 - 70\nNumber of students who do not like either game = 30\n\nSo, 30 students do not like either football or basketball."
