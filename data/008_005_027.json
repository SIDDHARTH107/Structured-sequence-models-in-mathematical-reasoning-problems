    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the third equation by 4 and then subtract the second equation from the result.\n\n4(x + 2y - 3z) = 4(-1)\n4x + 8y - 12z = -4\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the result:\n(4x + 8y - 12z) - (4x + y + 2z) = -4 - 8\n7y - 14z = -12\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the third equation by 2 and then subtract the first equation from the result.\n\n2(x + 2y - 3z) = 2(-1)\n2x + 4y - 6z = -2\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the result:\n(2x + 4y - 6z) - (2x + 3y - z) = -2 - 11\ny - 5z = -13\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n7y - 14z = -12\ny - 5z = -13\n\nWe can solve for y in the second equation:\n\ny = 5z - 13\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n7(5z - 13) - 14z = -12\n35z - 91 - 14z = -12\n21z = 79\nz = 79/21\n\nNow substitute the value of z back into the expression for y:\n\ny = 5(79/21) - 13\ny = 395/21 - 273/21\ny = 122/21\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find x:\n\n2x + 3(122/21) - (79/21) = 11\n2x + 366/21 - 79/21 = 11\n2x = 287/21 - 11\n2x = 287/21 - 231/21\n2x = 56/21\nx = 28/21\n\nSo the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 28/21\ny = 122/21\nz = 79/21"
