    "message_2": "To find the probability of the basketball player making all three free throws in a row, we need to multiply the probability of making each free throw together. Since the success rate is 80%, the probability of making each free throw is 0.8.\n\nSo, the probability of making all three free throws in a row is:\n\n0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512\n\nThe probability of making all three free throws in a row is 51.2%."
