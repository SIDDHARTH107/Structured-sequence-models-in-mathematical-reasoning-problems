    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of G, we can use the theorem that states that the chromatic number of a graph is at most one more than the maximum degree of its vertices (Δ(G) + 1). The maximum degree of a vertex in a graph with n vertices and e edges is given by the formula:\n\nΔ(G) = 2 * e / n\n\nIn this case, we have n = 10 vertices and e = 23 edges. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nΔ(G) = 2 * 23 / 10 = 46 / 10 = 4.6\n\nSince the maximum degree must be an integer, we round up to get Δ(G) = 5. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of G is:\n\nChromatic number = Δ(G) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6"
