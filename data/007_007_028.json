    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 3x + 4y = 17, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 4, and then find a particular solution for the equation.\n\nFirst, we find the GCD of 3 and 4 using the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n4 = 1 * 3 + 1\n3 = 1 * 1 + 2\n\nThe GCD of 3 and 4 is 1. Since 1 divides 17, there exists a solution for the Diophantine equation.\n\nNow, we can find a particular solution:\n\n1. Start with the equation 4 = 1 * 3 + 1\n2. Multiply both sides by 17: 68 = 17 * 3 + 17\n3. Rearrange the equation: 17 = 68 - 17 * 3\n4. Substitute the original equation (4 = 1 * 3 + 1) into the equation: 17 = (1 * 3 + 1) * 17 - 17 * 3\n5. Distribute and simplify: 17 = 17 * 3 + 17 - 17 * 3\n6. Cancel out the terms with 3: 17 = 17\n\nNow we have a particular solution: x = 1, y = 4.\n\nHowever, we want to find all integer solutions for x and y. To do this, we can use the general solution for Diophantine equations:\n\nx = x0 + k * (b / gcd(a, b))\ny = y0 - k * (a / gcd(a, b))\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 4, gcd(a, b) = 1, x0 = 1, and y0 = 4.\n\nx = 1 + k * (4 / 1)\ny = 4 - k * (3 / 1)\n\nx = 1 + 4k\ny = 4 - 3k\n\nNow, we have the general solution for the Diophantine equation 3x + 4y = 17. For any integer value of k, we can find a corresponding pair of integers x and y that satisfy the equation."
