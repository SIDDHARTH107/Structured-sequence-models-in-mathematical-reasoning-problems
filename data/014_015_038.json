    "message_2": "To encode the message \"MEET ME AFTER SCHOOL\" using the Rail Fence cipher technique with a rail count of 4, we first remove the spaces and then arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows. The arrangement will look like this:\n\nM . . . . E . . . . T\n. E . T . M . A . F . R\n. . E . . . . E . . . S\n. . . C . . . . H . . . O . . . . L\n\nNow, we read the letters row by row to form the ciphertext:\n\nM E T E T M A F R E E S C H O L\n\nSo, the ciphertext obtained using the Rail Fence cipher technique with a rail count of 4 is \"METETMAFREESCHOL\"."
