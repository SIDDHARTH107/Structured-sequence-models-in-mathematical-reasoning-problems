    "message_2": "The probability of rolling a six on a fair six-sided die is 1 out of 6 possible outcomes. To express this as a probability, we can write it as a fraction:\n\nProbability = Number of successful outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n\nIn this case, there is only 1 successful outcome (rolling a six) and 6 possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a six is:\n\nProbability = 1/6 â‰ˆ 0.1667 or 16.67%"
