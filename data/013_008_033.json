    "message_1": "Suppose there are four individuals who form a group to contribute money towards a public good. Each individual has an initial endowment of $10. In each round, they have the choice to contribute $0, $1 or $2 towards the public good. The contributions are then multiplied by a factor of 2 and evenly distributed among all four individuals, regardless of their initial contribution. However, if at least one individual chooses not to contribute, the public good is not funded and everyone receives no payoff. \n\nIf the game is played for five rounds and the individuals follow a strategy of always contributing $2, what is their final payoff at the end of the game?",
    "message_2": "If all four individuals contribute $2 each round, the total contribution per round will be $8. This amount is then multiplied by a factor of 2, resulting in $16. The $16 is then evenly distributed among all four individuals, giving each person $4.\n\nNow, let's calculate the payoff for each individual after five rounds:\n\nInitial endowment: $10\nTotal contribution over 5 rounds: 5 * $2 = $10\nRemaining balance after contributions: $10 - $10 = $0\n\nTotal earnings from public good over 5 rounds: 5 * $4 = $20\n\nFinal payoff for each individual: Remaining balance + Total earnings = $0 + $20 = $20"
