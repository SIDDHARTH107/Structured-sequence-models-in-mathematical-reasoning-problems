    "message_2": "The graph G is planar. A graph is planar if it can be drawn in a plane without any edges crossing. To show this, we can redraw the graph with a different arrangement of the vertices and edges.\n\nHere is a planar representation of the graph G:\n\n```\n    A---B\n   /|   |\\\n  / |   | \\\n F--E---C--D\n```\n\nIn this representation, none of the edges cross each other, so the graph G is planar."
