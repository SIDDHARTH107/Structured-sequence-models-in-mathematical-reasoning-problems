    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and successively adding smaller equilateral triangles to each side. Each iteration increases the number of sides by a factor of 4 and the length of each side is divided by 3.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake of order 4, we first need to determine the number of sides and the length of each side.\n\nNumber of sides:\nFor order 0 (the starting equilateral triangle), there are 3 sides.\nFor order 1, there are 3 * 4 = 12 sides.\nFor order 2, there are 12 * 4 = 48 sides.\nFor order 3, there are 48 * 4 = 192 sides.\nFor order 4, there are 192 * 4 = 768 sides.\n\nLength of each side:\nFor order 0, the length of each side is 8 cm.\nFor order 1, the length of each side is 8 / 3 = 8/3 cm.\nFor order 2, the length of each side is 8/3 / 3 = 8/9 cm.\nFor order 3, the length of each side is 8/9 / 3 = 8/27 cm.\nFor order 4, the length of each side is 8/27 / 3 = 8/81 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter by multiplying the number of sides by the length of each side:\n\nPerimeter = 768 sides * (8/81 cm) = (6144/81) cm â‰ˆ 75.85 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake of order 4 with a starting side length of 8 cm is approximately 75.85 cm."
