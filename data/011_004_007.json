    "message_1": "A committee of 5 people is to be formed from a group of 12 people, where 4 are engineers, 3 are programmers, and 5 are designers. In how many ways can the committee be formed such that there are at least 2 designers and at least 1 engineer?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations. We can break down the problem into three cases:\n\nCase 1: 2 designers, 1 engineer, and 2 programmers\nCase 2: 3 designers and 2 engineers\nCase 3: 4 designers and 1 engineer\n\nNow, we will calculate the number of ways to form the committee for each case.\n\nCase 1: 2 designers, 1 engineer, and 2 programmers\nThere are C(5,2) ways to choose 2 designers from 5, C(4,1) ways to choose 1 engineer from 4, and C(3,2) ways to choose 2 programmers from 3. So, the total number of ways for this case is:\nC(5,2) * C(4,1) * C(3,2) = 10 * 4 * 3 = 120\n\nCase 2: 3 designers and 2 engineers\nThere are C(5,3) ways to choose 3 designers from 5 and C(4,2) ways to choose 2 engineers from 4. So, the total number of ways for this case is:\nC(5,3) * C(4,2) = 10 * 6 = 60\n\nCase 3: 4 designers and 1 engineer\nThere are C(5,4) ways to choose 4 designers from 5 and C(4,1) ways to choose 1 engineer from 4. So, the total number of ways for this case is:\nC(5,4) * C(4,1) = 5 * 4 = 20\n\nNow, we will add the number of ways for each case to get the total number of ways to form the committee:\nTotal ways = Case 1 + Case 2 + Case 3 = 120 + 60 + 20 = 200\n\nSo, there are 200 ways to form the committee with the given conditions."
