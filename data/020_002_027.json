    "message_1": "A manufacturing company makes two types of products X and Y. The profit per unit of X is $5 and that of Y is $7. Each product has to go through two stages of production. The time required for each stage of production for X is 2 and 4 hours, respectively, and for Y is 3 and 2 hours, respectively. The total available time for stage 1 and stage 2 production is 100 and 90 hours, respectively. Find the number of units of each product the company should produce in order to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 5x + 7y\n\nThe constraints for the production time are:\n2x + 3y ≤ 100 (stage 1)\n4x + 2y ≤ 90 (stage 2)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 100\n   y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. 4x + 2y ≤ 90\n   y ≤ (90 - 4x) / 2\n\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all these inequalities. Now, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (100 - 2x) / 3: (0, 100/3)\n3. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (90 - 4x) / 2: (0, 45)\n4. Intersection of y = 0 and x = (100 - 3y) / 2: (50, 0)\n5. Intersection of y = 0 and x = (90 - 2y) / 4: (45/2, 0)\n6. Intersection of y = (100 - 2x) / 3 and y = (90 - 4x) / 2: (20, 20)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 7y at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 100/3) = 5(0) + 7(100/3) = 700/3 ≈ 233.33\n3. P(0, 45) = 5(0) + 7(45) = 315\n4. P(50, 0) = 5(50) + 7(0) = 250\n5. P(45/2, 0) = 5(45/2) + 7(0) = 225\n6. P(20, 20) = 5(20) + 7(20) = 240\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 45), with a profit of $315. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product X and 45 units of product Y to maximize their profit."
