    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the lighthouse and the shore as x. The ship's distance from the shore (10 km) and the lighthouse's distance from the ship (15 km) are the other two sides of the right-angled triangle.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 = 10^2 + 15^2\nx^2 = 100 + 225\nx^2 = 325\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 325 to get the value of x:\n\nx ≈ √325 ≈ 18.03\n\nRounding to the nearest kilometer, the distance between the lighthouse and the shore is approximately 18 kilometers."
