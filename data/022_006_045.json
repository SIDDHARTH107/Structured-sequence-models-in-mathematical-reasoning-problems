    "message_2": "First, let's recall the Maximum Modulus Principle and the Minimum Modulus Principle:\n\nMaximum Modulus Principle: If a function is holomorphic in a bounded domain and continuous up to its boundary, then the maximum of its modulus is attained on the boundary.\n\nMinimum Modulus Principle: If a function is holomorphic in a bounded domain, non-constant, and continuous up to its boundary, then the minimum of its modulus is attained on the boundary.\n\nNow, let's analyze the function $f(z) = ze^z$. It is clear that $f(z)$ is holomorphic on the open unit disk $D$, as it is a product of two holomorphic functions, $z$ and $e^z$. Moreover, $f(z)$ is continuous up to the boundary of $D$.\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ in $D$, we need to analyze the behavior of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary of $D$. The boundary of $D$ is the unit circle, given by $|z|=1$. Let $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. Then, we have:\n\n$$|f(z)| = |e^{i\\theta}e^{e^{i\\theta}}| = |e^{i\\theta}||e^{e^{i\\theta}}| = |e^{e^{i\\theta}}|$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the modulus of the exponential function:\n\n$$|e^{e^{i\\theta}}| = e^{\\operatorname{Re}(e^{i\\theta})} = e^{\\cos(\\theta)}$$\n\nSince $\\cos(\\theta)$ takes values in the range $[-1, 1]$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, we have that the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary of $D$ are:\n\n$$\\max_{\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)} |f(z)| = e^1 = e$$\n$$\\min_{\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)} |f(z)| = e^{-1} = \\frac{1}{e}$$\n\nBy the Maximum Modulus Principle and the Minimum Modulus Principle, these are also the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ in $D$. Therefore, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ in $D$ is $e$, and the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ in $D$ is $\\frac{1}{e}$."
