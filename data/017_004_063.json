    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (p^n where p=5 and n=2), we can apply the Sylow theorems. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 25\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Let H be this normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Since H has order 5, which is prime, H is cyclic. Thus, G has a normal cyclic subgroup of order 5.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 25 and |H| = 5, we have |G/H| = 5. Since the order of G/H is prime, G/H is cyclic. Let K be a subgroup of G such that K/H is a generator of G/H. Then, K is a cyclic subgroup of G with order 5.\n\nNow, we have two cyclic subgroups H and K with orders 5. Since H is normal in G, we can consider the product HK. We have:\n\n|HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K|\n\nSince H and K are both cyclic of order 5, their intersection can either be trivial (only containing the identity element) or equal to one of the subgroups. If H ∩ K is trivial, then |HK| = 25, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, both of which are cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIf H ∩ K is not trivial, then H = K, and G is a cyclic group of order 25, generated by H.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
