    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nA smooth quartic Fano surface $X \\subset \\mathbb{P}^4$ is a surface of degree 4 in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4$. The degree of a surface is the number of points in which it intersects a generic linear space of complementary dimension. In this case, the complementary dimension of a surface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is 2, so we are looking for the number of points in which $X$ intersects a generic plane.\n\nNow, we are given that $X$ contains a line $\\ell$ with $|\\ell\\cdot X|=7$. This means that the intersection of the line $\\ell$ with the surface $X$ consists of 7 points.\n\nSince $X$ is a quartic surface, it is defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4. The intersection of $X$ with a generic plane will be a curve of degree 4 in that plane. The line $\\ell$ is contained in $X$, so when we intersect $X$ with a plane containing $\\ell$, the intersection will consist of the line $\\ell$ and another curve of degree 3 in the plane.\n\nNow, we know that the intersection of $\\ell$ with $X$ consists of 7 points. Since $\\ell$ is a line, it is defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 1. The intersection of $\\ell$ with the curve of degree 3 in the plane will be a set of points defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $(1+3)=4$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the smooth quartic Fano surface $X \\subset \\mathbb{P}^4$ that contains a line $\\ell$ with $|\\ell\\cdot X|=7$ is 4."
