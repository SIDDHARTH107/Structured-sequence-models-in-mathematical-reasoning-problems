    "message_2": "To find the Weierstrass normal form of an elliptic curve with a point of order 3 and a point of order 4 over a field of characteristic 5, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. The Weierstrass normal form of an elliptic curve is given by the equation: y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B, where A and B are constants in the field of characteristic 5.\n\n2. Since the curve has a point of order 3, there exists a point P = (x1, y1) on the curve such that 3P = O (the point at infinity). This implies that [2P] + P = O, where [2P] is the point doubling of P.\n\n3. Similarly, since the curve has a point of order 4, there exists a point Q = (x2, y2) on the curve such that 4Q = O. This implies that [2Q] + [2Q] = O, where [2Q] is the point doubling of Q.\n\n4. We can use the point addition and point doubling formulas for elliptic curves to find the coordinates of [2P], [2Q], and [3P] in terms of x1, y1, x2, and y2.\n\n5. Since [3P] = O and [4Q] = O, we can equate the x-coordinates of [3P] and [4Q] to find a relationship between x1 and x2. Similarly, we can equate the y-coordinates of [3P] and [4Q] to find a relationship between y1 and y2.\n\n6. Substitute the relationships between x1, y1, x2, and y2 into the equation of the elliptic curve (y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B) to find the values of A and B in terms of x1 and x2.\n\n7. Finally, substitute the values of A and B back into the equation of the elliptic curve to obtain the Weierstrass normal form of the elliptic curve.\n\nHowever, without specific values for the points P and Q, we cannot provide an explicit equation for the Weierstrass normal form of the elliptic curve. The process outlined above can be used to find the equation once the coordinates of P and Q are known."
