    "message_2": "To determine the most common letter in the message \"ETAOIN SHRDLU\", we will count the occurrences of each letter and calculate their frequencies.\n\nE - 1\nT - 1\nA - 1\nO - 1\nI - 1\nN - 1\nS - 1\nH - 1\nR - 1\nD - 1\nL - 1\nU - 1\n\nThere are 12 letters in the message, and each letter occurs only once. Therefore, each letter has a frequency of 1/12, or approximately 8.33%. Since no letter occurs more frequently than the others, there is no most common letter in this message."
