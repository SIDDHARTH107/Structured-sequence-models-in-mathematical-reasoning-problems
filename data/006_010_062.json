    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people affected by the disease, you can multiply the probability of being affected by the total number of people in the group.\n\nExpected number of people affected = Probability of being affected × Total number of people in the group\n\nExpected number of people affected = 0.05 × 500\n\nExpected number of people affected = 25\n\nSo, you would expect 25 people in the demographic group to be affected by the disease."
