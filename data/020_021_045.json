    "message_1": "A school has two classes each with 30 students. The school needs to schedule a 1-hour computer lab session for each class. There are 20 computers available in the lab. Each student needs to spend at least 30 minutes in the lab. What's the maximum number of students that can use the lab in one session?",
    "message_2": "The maximum number of students that can use the lab in one session is 20, as there are only 20 computers available. To accommodate all 30 students from each class, the school can schedule two 30-minute sessions for each class, allowing 20 students to use the lab in the first session and the remaining 10 students to use the lab in the second session."
