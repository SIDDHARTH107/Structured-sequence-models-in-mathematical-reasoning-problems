The system is set in motion with an initial displacement of 5 cm and an initial velocity of 0.3 m/s. Calculate the displacement equation for the system and find the frequency and period of oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement equation for the mass-spring system, we can use the following formula:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω) using the spring constant (k) and mass (m):\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nω = √(100 N/m / 2 kg)\n\nω = √(50 s^(-2))\n\nω = 5√2 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ). We know the initial displacement (x0) is 5 cm (0.05 m) and the initial velocity (v0) is 0.3 m/s. We can use these values to find A and φ:\n\nx0 = A * cos(φ)\nv0 = -A * ω * sin(φ)\n\nWe have two equations and two unknowns (A and φ). We can solve for A and φ using these equations:\n\n0.05 = A * cos(φ)\n0.3 = -A * (5√2) * sin(φ)\n\nTo eliminate one of the variables, we can square both equations and add them together:\n\n(0.05)^2 + (0.3/(5√2))^2 = A^2 * (cos^2(φ) + sin^2(φ))\n\n0.0025 + 0.0018 = A^2\n\nA^2 = 0.0043\n\nA = √0.0043 ≈ 0.0655 m\n\nNow, we can find the phase angle (φ) using the first equation:\n\n0.05 = 0.0655 * cos(φ)\n\ncos(φ) = 0.05 / 0.0655\n\nφ = arccos(0.05 / 0.0655) ≈ 0.841 rad\n\nNow we have all the values needed for the displacement equation:\n\nx(t) = 0.0655 * cos(5√2 * t + 0.841)\n\nThe frequency (f) and period (T) of oscillation can be found using the angular frequency (ω):\n\nf = ω / (2π)\nT = 1 / f\n\nf = (5√2) / (2π) ≈ 1.118 Hz\nT = 1 / 1.118 ≈ 0.895 s\n\nSo, the displacement equation for the system is x(t) = 0.0655 * cos(5√2 * t + 0.841), and the frequency and period of oscillation are approximately 1.118 Hz and 0.895 s, respectively."
