    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) ∩ B:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ B = {1, 2, 6, 7} ∩ {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} = {6, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B △ A:\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nB ∩ A = {3, 4, 5}\n\nB △ A = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find (B △ A) ∩ A:\n\n(B △ A) ∩ A = {1, 2, 6, 7} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 2}\n\nNow we have (A △ B) ∩ B = {6, 7} and (B △ A) ∩ A = {1, 2}. Since {6, 7} ≠ {1, 2}, we can conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
