    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, four individuals each contribute money to a shared pot, which will then be multiplied by a factor of 1.6 and distributed evenly among the four individuals. Each individual has an initial endowment of $100. If everyone contributes their full endowment, they will each receive $200. However, if some people do not contribute, the contribution will be multiplied by a smaller factor and those who contribute less will earn more. \n\nAssuming that the four individuals are rational and self-interested, what is the Nash Equilibrium in this situation? Specifically, how much money will each individual contribute to the shared pot?",
    "message_2": "In a Public Goods Game, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when each individual chooses a strategy that is the best response to the strategies chosen by the other individuals. In this case, the strategy is the amount of money each individual contributes to the shared pot.\n\nLet's denote the contribution of each individual as x1, x2, x3, and x4. The total contribution to the shared pot is x1 + x2 + x3 + x4. The pot will be multiplied by a factor of 1.6 and then distributed evenly among the four individuals. So, each individual will receive 0.4 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4).\n\nNow, let's consider the payoff for each individual. The payoff is the amount of money they receive from the shared pot minus their contribution. For individual 1, the payoff is:\n\nPayoff1 = 0.4 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4) - x1\n\nSince each individual is rational and self-interested, they will try to maximize their payoff. In this case, individual 1 can maximize their payoff by contributing nothing (x1 = 0). This is because the 0.4 factor is less than 1, so they will lose money by contributing to the shared pot.\n\nThe same logic applies to the other three individuals. They will also maximize their payoffs by contributing nothing (x2 = x3 = x4 = 0).\n\nTherefore, the Nash Equilibrium in this situation is when each individual contributes nothing to the shared pot (x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = 0)."
