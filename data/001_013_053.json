    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(5x - 8) = 2, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n(√(5x - 8))^2 = 2^2\n\n2. Simplify:\n\n5x - 8 = 4\n\n3. Add 8 to both sides:\n\n5x = 12\n\n4. Divide by 5:\n\nx = 12/5\n\nSo, the solution for the equation √(5x - 8) = 2 is x = 12/5."
