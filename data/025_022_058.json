    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number of X and Y, we will use the intersection theory on projective spaces. Let H be a hyperplane in P³, and let H' be a hyperplane in P⁴. We know that the intersection of X with H is a divisor of degree 3, and the intersection of Y with H' is a divisor of degree d.\n\nNow, consider the intersection of X and Y in P³. Since Y is given by a hyperplane section of degree d in P⁴, we can write Y = dH' ∩ P³ for some hyperplane H' in P⁴. Therefore, the intersection of X and Y in P³ can be represented as X ∩ (dH' ∩ P³).\n\nUsing the properties of intersection numbers, we have:\n\n(X ∩ Y) = (X ∩ (dH' ∩ P³)) = d(X ∩ H').\n\nNow, we need to compute the intersection number (X ∩ H'). Since X is a non-singular cubic curve in P³, its intersection with a hyperplane H' in P⁴ will be a divisor of degree 3. Therefore, (X ∩ H') = 3.\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation, we get:\n\n(X ∩ Y) = d(X ∩ H') = d(3) = 3d.\n\nHence, the intersection number of X and Y is equal to 3d."
