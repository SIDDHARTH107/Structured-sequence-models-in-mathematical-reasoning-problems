    "message_2": "To find the critical points of f(x), we first need to compute the first and second derivatives of the function.\n\nf(x) = x^2(1-x)^2\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = 2x(1-x)^2 - 2x^2(1-x) = 2x(1-x)(1-2x)\n\nSecond derivative:\nf''(x) = 2(1-x)(1-2x) - 2x(1-2x) - 4x(1-x) = 2(1-6x+6x^2)\n\nNow, we find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for x:\n\n2x(1-x)(1-2x) = 0\n\nThis gives us three critical points: x = 0, x = 1, and x = 1/2.\n\nNow, we analyze the second derivative at these critical points to determine their nature:\n\nf''(0) = 2(1) = 2 > 0, so x = 0 is a local minimum.\nf''(1) = 2(1-6+6) = 2 > 0, so x = 1 is a local minimum.\nf''(1/2) = 2(1-6(1/2)+6(1/4)) = -2 < 0, so x = 1/2 is a local maximum.\n\nNow we use Morse theory to calculate the Betti numbers of the level sets of f(x). Morse theory states that the Betti numbers are determined by the critical points of the function.\n\nThe Betti numbers are given by:\n\nb_0 = number of local minima = 2\nb_1 = number of saddle points = 0\nb_2 = number of local maxima = 1\n\nSo, the Betti numbers of the level sets of f(x) are b_0 = 2, b_1 = 0, and b_2 = 1."
