    "message_2": "The moduli space M_g is the space of isomorphism classes of smooth projective curves of genus g. In this case, g = 3. To determine the dimension of M_g, we can use the formula:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3\n\nwhere g is the genus of the curve. Plugging in the value of g, we get:\n\ndim(M_3) = 3(3) - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6\n\nSo, the dimension of the moduli space M_3 of algebraic curves that are birational to X is 6."
