    "message_2": "Let's call the number x. According to the given information, we have the following two equations:\n\n1) x ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n2) x ≡ 2 (mod 4)\n\nSince x leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by both 3 and 4, we can rewrite the equations as:\n\n1) x = 3a + 2\n2) x = 4b + 2\n\nWhere a and b are integers.\n\nNow, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n3a + 2 = 4b + 2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3a = 4b\n\nWe are looking for the smallest possible value of x, so we want to find the smallest values of a and b that satisfy the equation. We can start by testing small values for a and b:\n\nIf a = 1, then 3a = 3, and b = 3/4, which is not an integer.\nIf a = 2, then 3a = 6, and b = 6/4 = 3/2, which is not an integer.\nIf a = 3, then 3a = 9, and b = 9/4, which is not an integer.\nIf a = 4, then 3a = 12, and b = 12/4 = 3, which is an integer.\n\nSo, the smallest values of a and b that satisfy the equation are a = 4 and b = 3. Plugging these values back into either equation, we get:\n\nx = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of x is 14."
