    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition between two firms, where firm A is the leader and firm B is the follower. The market demand is given by the following equation: \n\nQ = 100 - 2P \n\nwhere Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. Firm A's marginal cost is $20 and firm B's marginal cost is $30. \n\nIf firm A acts as a Stackelberg leader, what will be the equilibrium price and quantity in the market?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium price and quantity in a Stackelberg competition, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the inverse demand function (P as a function of Q).\n2. Write down the reaction function for firm B (firm B's output as a function of firm A's output).\n3. Substitute firm B's reaction function into the inverse demand function to find the residual demand function for firm A.\n4. Find the profit-maximizing output for firm A by equating its marginal revenue (MR) to its marginal cost (MC).\n5. Substitute firm A's output into firm B's reaction function to find firm B's output.\n6. Substitute the outputs of both firms into the inverse demand function to find the equilibrium price.\n7. Calculate the total quantity by summing the outputs of both firms.\n\nStep 1: Inverse demand function\nP = 50 - 0.5Q\n\nStep 2: Reaction function for firm B\nTo find firm B's reaction function, we need to find its profit-maximizing output given firm A's output. Firm B's profit function is:\n\nπ_B = (P - MC_B) * q_B\n\nSubstitute the inverse demand function into the profit function:\n\nπ_B = ((50 - 0.5(Q_A + q_B)) - 30) * q_B\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the first-order condition (FOC) by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to q_B and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ_B/dq_B = 50 - 0.5Q_A - q_B - 30 = 0\n\nSolving for q_B, we get the reaction function for firm B:\n\nq_B = 20 - 0.5Q_A\n\nStep 3: Residual demand function for firm A\nSubstitute firm B's reaction function into the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 50 - 0.5(Q_A + (20 - 0.5Q_A))\n\nStep 4: Profit-maximizing output for firm A\nFirm A's profit function is:\n\nπ_A = (P - MC_A) * Q_A\n\nSubstitute the residual demand function into the profit function:\n\nπ_A = ((50 - 0.5(Q_A + (20 - 0.5Q_A))) - 20) * Q_A\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the FOC by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_A and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ_A/dQ_A = 30 - 0.75Q_A = 0\n\nSolving for Q_A, we get:\n\nQ_A = 40\n\nStep 5: Firm B's output\nSubstitute firm A's output into firm B's reaction function:\n\nq_B = 20 - 0.5(40) = 20 - 20 = 0\n\nStep 6: Equilibrium price\nSubstitute the outputs of both firms into the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 50 - 0.5(40 + 0) = 50 - 20 = 30\n\nStep 7: Total quantity\nQ = Q_A + q_B = 40 + 0 = 40\n\nSo, the equilibrium price is $30, and the equilibrium quantity is 40 units."
