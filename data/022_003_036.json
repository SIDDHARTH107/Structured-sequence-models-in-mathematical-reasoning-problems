    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is analytic inside and on $C$, it has an antiderivative $F(z)$ on the region enclosed by $C$. Therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for contour integrals, we have:\n\n$\\oint_C f(z)dz = F(z)\\Big|_{z_1}^{z_2} = 0$\n\nwhere $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the starting and ending points of the contour $C$. Since the contour is a closed curve, $z_1 = z_2$, and the integral of $f(z)$ over the contour $C$ is equal to 0."
