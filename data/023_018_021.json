    "message_2": "To determine the steady-state output of the system, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input sinusoidal signal. The input signal is given by:\n\nx(t) = 5 * sin(2 * pi * 2 * t)\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of x(t), we get:\n\nX(s) = L{x(t)} = 5 * L{sin(4 * pi * t)} = (5 * 4 * pi) / (s^2 + (4 * pi)^2)\n\nNow, we can find the output in the Laplace domain by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input X(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * X(s) = [(s + 2) / (s^2 + 4s + 5)] * [(20 * pi) / (s^2 + (4 * pi)^2)]\n\nTo find the steady-state output, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){Y(s)}\n\nTo do this, we can use partial fraction decomposition to break Y(s) into simpler terms:\n\nY(s) = A / (s^2 + 4s + 5) + B / (s^2 + (4 * pi)^2)\n\nSolving for A and B, we get:\n\nA = [(s + 2) / (s^2 + (4 * pi)^2)] evaluated at s = -2 = 20 * pi / (4 * pi)^2\nB = [(s + 2) / (s^2 + 4s + 5)] evaluated at s = -4 * pi * j = (20 * pi) / (4 * pi * j)\n\nNow, we can take the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){A / (s^2 + 4s + 5)} + L^(-1){B / (s^2 + (4 * pi)^2)}\n\nThe first term corresponds to the response of the system to the input signal, and the second term corresponds to the steady-state output. Since we are only interested in the steady-state output, we can focus on the second term:\n\ny_ss(t) = L^(-1){(20 * pi) / (4 * pi * j) * 1 / (s^2 + (4 * pi)^2)}\n\ny_ss(t) = (5 / j) * sin(4 * pi * t)\n\nThe steady-state output of the system is a sinusoidal signal with the same frequency as the input (2 Hz) and an amplitude of 5 units. However, it has a phase shift of -90 degrees due to the factor of 1/j."
