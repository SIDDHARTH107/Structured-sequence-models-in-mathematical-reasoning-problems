    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, V = 10 and E = 15. We can rearrange the formula to find the number of faces:\n\nF = 2 - V + E = 2 - 10 + 15 = 7\n\nNow, let's check if the graph is non-planar using the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph could be planar. However, we need to check if the graph satisfies the condition for the genus. The genus g of a graph can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to find the genus:\n\ng ≥ (E - 3V + 6) / 6\n\ng ≥ (15 - 3 * 10 + 6) / 6\n\ng ≥ (-15) / 6\n\nSince the genus cannot be negative, the minimum genus for this graph is 0. Therefore, the graph is planar, and its genus is 0."
