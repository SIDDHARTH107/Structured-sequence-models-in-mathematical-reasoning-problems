    "message_2": "To calculate the z-score, we use the formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the individual data point (in this case, the employee's salary), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nGiven the mean salary (μ) is $65,000 and the standard deviation (σ) is $10,000, we can find the z-score for an employee who earns a salary of $80,000 (X).\n\nz = (80,000 - 65,000) / 10,000\nz = 15,000 / 10,000\nz = 1.5\n\nThe z-score for an employee who earns a salary of $80,000 is 1.5."
