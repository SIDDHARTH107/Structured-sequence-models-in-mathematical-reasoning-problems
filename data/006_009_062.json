    "message_1": "Assuming that the probability of a person having a certain medical condition is 0.15. If 20 people are randomly selected, what is the probability that at least two of them have the condition?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least two people have the condition, we can first find the probability that none or only one person has the condition, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability that none of the 20 people have the condition. Since the probability of a person not having the condition is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85, the probability that all 20 people do not have the condition is (0.85)^20.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that exactly one person has the condition. There are 20 ways to choose which person has the condition (20 choose 1), and the probability of that person having the condition is 0.15, while the other 19 people do not have the condition with a probability of 0.85. So, the probability of exactly one person having the condition is (20 choose 1) * (0.15)^1 * (0.85)^19.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least two people having the condition by subtracting the probabilities of none and exactly one person having the condition from 1:\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(none) - P(exactly 1)\nP(at least 2) = 1 - (0.85)^20 - (20 choose 1) * (0.15)^1 * (0.85)^19\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - (0.85)^20 - 20 * (0.15) * (0.85)^19\nP(at least 2) ≈ 1 - 0.3585 - 20 * 0.15 * 0.3774\nP(at least 2) ≈ 1 - 0.3585 - 3 * 0.3774\nP(at least 2) ≈ 1 - 0.3585 - 1.1322\nP(at least 2) ≈ 1 - 1.4907\nP(at least 2) ≈ 0.5093\n\nSo, the probability that at least two of the 20 randomly selected people have the condition is approximately 0.5093 or 50.93%."
