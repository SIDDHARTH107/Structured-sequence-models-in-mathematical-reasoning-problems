    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It is constructed through a series of iterations, with each iteration increasing the complexity of the curve.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the Peano curve consists of 9 smaller line segments, each with a length of 1/3 of the original line segment. Therefore, the total length of the Peano curve after the first iteration is:\n\n9 * (1/3) = 3\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve after the first iteration is 3."
