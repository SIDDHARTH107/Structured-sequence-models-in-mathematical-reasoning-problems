    "message_2": "The probability of a randomly selected person from this demographic being affected by the disease is 15% or 0.15.\n\nTo find the expected number of people affected by the disease in a population of 500,000, we can multiply the probability by the population size:\n\nExpected number of affected people = Probability × Population size\nExpected number of affected people = 0.15 × 500,000\nExpected number of affected people = 75,000\n\nSo, the expected number of people from this group that will be affected by the disease is 75,000."
