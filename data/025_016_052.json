    "message_2": "To determine if the curves C and D are birationally equivalent, we will try to find a birational map between them. A birational map is a pair of rational functions (f, g) such that f: C → D and g: D → C are inverses of each other.\n\nLet's first rewrite the equations of the curves as follows:\n\nC: y^2 = x^3 - x = x(x^2 - 1)\nD: y^2 = x^2 - x = x(x - 1)\n\nNow, let's try to find a birational map from C to D. We can define a rational function f: C → D as follows:\n\nf(x, y) = (x', y') = (x^2, xy)\n\nWe can see that f is well-defined since x^2 and xy are rational functions in x and y. Now, let's check if f maps C to D:\n\ny'^2 = (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = x^2(x^3 - x) = x^2(x^2 - 1)\n\nSo, f indeed maps C to D. Now, let's try to find the inverse map g: D → C. We can define g as follows:\n\ng(x', y') = (x, y) = (x', y'/x')\n\nWe can see that g is well-defined since x' and y'/x' are rational functions in x' and y'. Now, let's check if g maps D to C:\n\ny^2 = (y'/x')^2 = (y'^2)/(x'^2) = (x^2 - 1)/(x^2) = x^3 - x\n\nSo, g indeed maps D to C. Therefore, the curves C and D are birationally equivalent, and the birational map between them is given by:\n\nf(x, y) = (x^2, xy)\ng(x', y') = (x', y'/x')"
