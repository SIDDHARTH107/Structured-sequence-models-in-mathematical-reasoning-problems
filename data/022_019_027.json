Unfortunately, there is no closed-form expression for the integral in terms of elementary functions. However, we can approximate the integral using numerical methods, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.\n\nLet's denote the integral as $I$:\n\n$I = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin(t/2)}{\\sinh(2\\pi\\sin t/2)}f((1+i)+e^{it})dt$\n\nUsing a numerical method, we can approximate the value of $I$. Let's assume that we have computed the approximation of $I$ and denote it as $I_{approx}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the approximation of the integral back into the equation for $f(1+i)$:\n\n$f(1+i) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(1+i) - \\frac{1}{\\pi}I_{approx}$\n\nThus, the solution to the integral equation for $f(z)$ at $z = 1 + i$ is given by:\n\n$f(1+i) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(1+i) - \\frac{1}{\\pi}I_{approx}$"
