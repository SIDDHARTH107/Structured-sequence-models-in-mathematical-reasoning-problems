If 10 students chose both blue and green, 8 chose both green and yellow, 5 chose both blue and yellow, and 2 chose all three colors, how many students chose only one color?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the number of students who chose blue, B be the number of students who chose green, and C be the number of students who chose yellow. We are given:\n\nA = 30\nB = 25\nC = 20\n\nLet A ∩ B be the number of students who chose both blue and green, B ∩ C be the number of students who chose both green and yellow, and A ∩ C be the number of students who chose both blue and yellow. We are given:\n\nA ∩ B = 10\nB ∩ C = 8\nA ∩ C = 5\n\nLet A ∩ B ∩ C be the number of students who chose all three colors. We are given:\n\nA ∩ B ∩ C = 2\n\nWe want to find the number of students who chose only one color. Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we can find the number of students who chose at least one color:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (A ∩ B + B ∩ C + A ∩ C) + A ∩ B ∩ C\n\nSince there are 50 students in total, we have:\n\n50 = 30 + 25 + 20 - (10 + 8 + 5) + 2\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n50 = 75 - 23 + 2\n50 = 52\n\nNow we need to find the number of students who chose only one color:\n\nOnly one color = Total - (A ∩ B + B ∩ C + A ∩ C - A ∩ B ∩ C)\nOnly one color = 50 - (10 + 8 + 5 - 2)\nOnly one color = 50 - 21\nOnly one color = 29\n\nSo, 29 students chose only one color."
