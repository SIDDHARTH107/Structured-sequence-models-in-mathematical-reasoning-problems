    "message_2": "A quadratic residue modulo n is an integer that is congruent to a perfect square modulo n. In other words, a number x is a quadratic residue modulo n if there exists an integer y such that x ≡ y^2 (mod n).\n\nTo find the quadratic residues modulo 11, we can calculate the squares of the integers from 0 to 10 (since 11 is a prime number) and then reduce them modulo 11.\n\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 11)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n4^2 ≡ 16 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n6^2 ≡ 36 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n8^2 ≡ 64 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n9^2 ≡ 81 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n10^2 ≡ 100 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nThe distinct quadratic residues modulo 11 are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the square roots of each residue:\n\n- For the residue 0, the square root is 0.\n- For the residue 1, the square roots are 1 and 10 (since 1^2 ≡ 10^2 ≡ 1 (mod 11)).\n- For the residue 3, the square roots are 5 and 6 (since 5^2 ≡ 6^2 ≡ 3 (mod 11)).\n- For the residue 4, the square roots are 2 and 9 (since 2^2 ≡ 9^2 ≡ 4 (mod 11)).\n- For the residue 5, the square roots are 4 and 7 (since 4^2 ≡ 7^2 ≡ 5 (mod 11)).\n- For the residue 9, the square roots are 3 and 8 (since 3^2 ≡ 8^2 ≡ 9 (mod 11)).\n\nSo, the square roots of each quadratic residue modulo 11 are as follows:\n\n0: {0}\n1: {1, 10}\n3: {5, 6}\n4: {2, 9}\n5: {4, 7}\n9: {3, 8}"
