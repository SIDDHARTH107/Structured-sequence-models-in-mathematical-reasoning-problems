    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA radioactive element has a half-life of 30 years. If the initial amount of the element is 100 grams, find the amount of the element after 90 years.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 100 grams, the half-life is 30 years, and the time elapsed is 90 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal Amount = 100 * (1/2)^(90 / 30)\n\nFinal Amount = 100 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal Amount = 100 * (1/8)\n\nFinal Amount = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 90 years, there will be 12.5 grams of the radioactive element remaining."
