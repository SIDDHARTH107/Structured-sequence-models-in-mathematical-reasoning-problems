    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group with compact support of X, we will use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem and the Poincaré duality.\n\nLet X be a complete intersection of two hypersurfaces in CP^6, with degrees 3 and 4. Then, the codimension of X in CP^6 is 2, and the dimension of X is 4.\n\nBy the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the restriction map H^k(CP^6, C) → H^k(X, C) is an isomorphism for k < 4 and an injection for k = 4. Since H^1(CP^6, C) = 0, we have H^1(X, C) = 0.\n\nNow, we want to compute the first cohomology group with compact support, H^1_c(X, C). By Poincaré duality, we have:\n\nH^1_c(X, C) ≅ H^{2n-1}(X, C),\n\nwhere n is the dimension of X, which is 4 in this case. So we need to compute H^7(X, C).\n\nSince H^7(CP^6, C) = 0, the restriction map H^7(CP^6, C) → H^7(X, C) is an injection. Therefore, H^7(X, C) = 0.\n\nBy Poincaré duality, we have:\n\nH^1_c(X, C) ≅ H^7(X, C) = 0.\n\nSo the first cohomology group with compact support of X, over the field of complex numbers, is trivial."
