The researcher collects data on the athletes' performance in each sport, including the number of points scored in basketball games, the number of goals scored in football matches, and the number of sets won in tennis matches. \n\nThe researcher wants to use factor analysis to identify any underlying factors that may be influencing the athletes' performance across these three sports. The researcher collects data from 30 athletes and identifies a total of three factors that explain 70% of the variance in the athletes' performance data.\n\nWhat is the cumulative percentage of the three factors that explains the variability in the athletes' performance data?",
