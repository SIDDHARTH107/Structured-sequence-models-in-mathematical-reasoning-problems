    "message_1": "A bird sitting on a tree branch 20 feet above the ground spots a worm below. The angle of depression from the bird to the worm is 30 degrees. How far away from the base of the tree is the worm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have a right triangle with the angle of depression (30 degrees), the height of the tree branch (20 feet), and we want to find the distance from the base of the tree to the worm (the adjacent side of the triangle).\n\nWe can use the tangent function, which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this case, the angle is 30 degrees, and the opposite side is the height of the tree branch (20 feet). We want to find the adjacent side (the distance from the base of the tree to the worm).\n\ntan(30) = 20 / adjacent side\n\nTo find the adjacent side, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nadjacent side = 20 / tan(30)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value for the tangent of 30 degrees. The tangent of 30 degrees is approximately 0.577:\n\nadjacent side = 20 / 0.577\n\nadjacent side â‰ˆ 34.64 feet\n\nSo, the worm is approximately 34.64 feet away from the base of the tree."
