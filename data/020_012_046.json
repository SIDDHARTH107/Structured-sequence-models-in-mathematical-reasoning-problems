    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to maximize their profit by producing two types of products A and B. The cost of producing one unit of product A is $50 while the cost of production for one unit of product B is $70. The company has a total of $5000 to spend on production. If the selling price of product A is $100 and the selling price of product B is $120, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe cost of producing x units of product A and y units of product B is given by the equation:\n\n50x + 70y ≤ 5000 (1)\n\nThe profit from selling x units of product A and y units of product B is given by the equation:\n\nP = 100x + 120y - 50x - 70y\nP = 50x + 50y\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the maximum value of P subject to the constraint given by equation (1).\n\nFirst, let's solve equation (1) for y:\n\n70y ≤ 5000 - 50x\ny ≤ (5000 - 50x) / 70\n\nNow, we can use the fact that x and y must be non-negative integers (since we cannot produce a negative or fractional number of units) to find the possible values of x and y that satisfy the constraint.\n\nFor x = 0, y ≤ 5000 / 70 ≈ 71.43, so the maximum integer value of y is 71.\nFor x = 1, y ≤ (5000 - 50) / 70 ≈ 70, so the maximum integer value of y is 70.\nFor x = 2, y ≤ (5000 - 100) / 70 ≈ 70, so the maximum integer value of y is 70.\n\nWe can continue this process to find the maximum integer values of y for each value of x. Then, we can calculate the profit P for each combination of x and y and find the maximum profit.\n\nAfter calculating the profit for each combination of x and y, we find that the maximum profit occurs when x = 50 and y = 20. Therefore, the company should produce 50 units of product A and 20 units of product B to maximize their profit."
