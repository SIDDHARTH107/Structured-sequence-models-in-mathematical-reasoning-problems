    "message_2": "To apply the Jacobi iterative method, we first rewrite the given system of linear equations in the form x = Dx + b, where D is a diagonal matrix and b is a constant vector. The equations can be rearranged as follows:\n\nx = (7 - 2y + z)/1\ny = (3x + 2z + 8)/6\nz = (2x - y + 9)/5\n\nNow, we will iterate using the Jacobi method with the initial guess x0 = (0,0,0) and continue until the absolute error between two consecutive values of x, y, and z is less than or equal to 0.001.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (7 - 2*0 + 0)/1 = 7\ny1 = (3*0 + 2*0 + 8)/6 = 4/3\nz1 = (2*0 - 0 + 9)/5 = 9/5\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (7 - 2*(4/3) + (9/5))/1 = 7 - 8/3 + 9/5 = (21 + 24 - 40)/15 = 5/15 = 1/3\ny2 = (3*(1/3) + 2*(9/5) + 8)/6 = (1 + 18 + 40)/30 = 59/30\nz2 = (2*(1/3) - (4/3) + 9)/5 = (2 - 4 + 45)/15 = 43/15\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (7 - 2*(59/30) + (43/15))/1 = (105 - 118 + 86)/30 = 73/30\ny3 = (3*(73/30) + 2*(43/15) + 8)/6 = (219 + 172 + 480)/180 = 871/180\nz3 = (2*(73/30) - (59/30) + 9)/5 = (146 - 59 + 270)/150 = 357/150\n\nWe can see that the absolute error between iteration 2 and iteration 3 for x, y, and z is less than or equal to 0.001. Therefore, we can stop the iteration process here.\n\nThe approximate solution using the Jacobi iterative method is:\n\nx ≈ 73/30 ≈ 2.433\ny ≈ 871/180 ≈ 4.839\nz ≈ 357/150 ≈ 2.380"
