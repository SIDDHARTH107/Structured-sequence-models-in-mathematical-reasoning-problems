    "message_2": "The statement ∀x (x ∈ A → x² > 0) can be read as \"For all x in the set A, if x is an element of A, then x squared is greater than 0.\"\n\nLet's check the truth value for each element in the set A:\n\n1. For x = 1, 1² = 1, which is greater than 0.\n2. For x = 2, 2² = 4, which is greater than 0.\n3. For x = 3, 3² = 9, which is greater than 0.\n4. For x = 4, 4² = 16, which is greater than 0.\n5. For x = 5, 5² = 25, which is greater than 0.\n\nSince the statement is true for all elements in the set A, the truth value of the statement is True."
