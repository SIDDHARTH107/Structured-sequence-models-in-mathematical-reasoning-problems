    "message_2": "Using Ramsey theory, we can solve this problem by finding the minimum number of handshakes required to guarantee either a triangle (three people shaking hands with each other) or an independent set of size 3 (three people not shaking hands with each other).\n\nLet R(m, n) denote the minimum number of vertices in a graph such that any graph with that many vertices will contain either a complete subgraph of size m (all m vertices are connected to each other) or an independent set of size n (none of the n vertices are connected to each other).\n\nIn this problem, we are looking for R(3, 3), which is the minimum number of people such that either three people shake hands with each other or three people do not shake hands with each other.\n\nUsing the recursive formula for Ramsey numbers, R(m, n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1) - 1, we can find R(3, 3):\n\nR(3, 3) = R(2, 3) + R(3, 2) - 1\nR(2, 3) = 3 (since 3 people are enough to guarantee either a pair shaking hands or a pair not shaking hands)\nR(3, 2) = 3 (for the same reason)\n\nSo, R(3, 3) = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of handshakes that must occur in a group of six people to guarantee either three people shaking hands with each other or three people not shaking hands with each other is 5."
