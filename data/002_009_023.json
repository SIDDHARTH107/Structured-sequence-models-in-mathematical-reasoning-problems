    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 5 cm. What is the total surface area of the cylinder (including the top and bottom circles)?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nThe area of one circular base is:\nA = π(5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n2 × 25π cm² = 50π cm²\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nThe lateral surface area is:\nA = 2π(5 cm)(10 cm) = 100π cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\nTotal Surface Area = 50π cm² + 100π cm² = 150π cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is 150π cm²."
