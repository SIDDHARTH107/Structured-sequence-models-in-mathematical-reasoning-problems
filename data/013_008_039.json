    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 5 players is playing the public goods game. Each player is given 10 points at the beginning and they all have to decide whether to contribute to a communal fund or not. If a player chooses to contribute, their contribution is doubled and then evenly distributed among all the players regardless of whether or not they chose to contribute. However, if a player doesn't contribute, they keep their 10 points.\n\nIf all players decide to contribute, what will be their final number of points after the communal fund has been distributed? And what will be the final number of points for each player if only 3 out of 5 players decide to contribute?",
    "message_2": "If all players decide to contribute, each player contributes 10 points, making a total of 50 points in the communal fund. The fund doubles the contributions, resulting in 100 points. These 100 points are then evenly distributed among all 5 players, so each player receives 20 points.\n\nIf only 3 out of 5 players decide to contribute, the total contribution to the communal fund is 3 * 10 = 30 points. The fund doubles the contributions, resulting in 60 points. These 60 points are then evenly distributed among all 5 players, so each player receives 12 points. The 3 players who contributed will have 12 points each after the distribution, while the 2 players who did not contribute will keep their initial 10 points, making their final number of points 10 each."
