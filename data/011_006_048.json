    "message_1": "A box contains 4 different types of candies: chocolate, lollipop, gummy bear, and mint. How many ways are there to choose 6 candies if there are no restrictions?",
    "message_2": "We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We have 6 candies to choose (stars) and 3 dividers (bars) to separate the 4 types of candies. The problem can be visualized as follows:\n\n* * * * * * | | |\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to arrange these 6 stars and 3 bars, which is a combination problem. There are a total of 9 positions (6 stars + 3 bars), and we need to choose 3 positions for the bars. So, the number of ways to choose 6 candies is:\n\nC(9,3) = 9! / (3! * (9-3)!) = 9! / (3! * 6!) = 84 ways."
