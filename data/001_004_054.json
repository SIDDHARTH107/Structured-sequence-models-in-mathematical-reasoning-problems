    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x^2 + 9x + 8, we need to find two binomials (two terms) that multiply to give the original polynomial. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to the constant term (8) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (9).\n\nThe two numbers that satisfy these conditions are 1 and 8, since 1 * 8 = 8 and 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial x^2 + 9x + 8 is:\n\n(x + 1)(x + 8)"
