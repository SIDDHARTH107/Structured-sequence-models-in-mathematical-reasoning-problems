    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change after each iteration. It remains constant regardless of the number of iterations. To find the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, N = 4 (each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments), and the scaling factor s = 3 (each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.26186.\n\nTherefore, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the 5th iteration (or any iteration) is approximately 1.26186."
