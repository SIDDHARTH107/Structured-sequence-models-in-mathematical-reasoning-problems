    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups of a torus, we can use the fact that a torus can be represented as the product of two circles, X = S^1 × S^1. We will use the Künneth formula to compute the cohomology groups of the torus.\n\nThe Künneth formula states that for spaces X and Y, and for any n ≥ 0, we have:\n\nH^n(X × Y; Z) = ⊕_{p+q=n} (H^p(X; Z) ⊗ H^q(Y; Z))\n\nFor a circle S^1, we have the following cohomology groups:\n\nH^0(S^1; Z) = Z\nH^1(S^1; Z) = Z\nH^k(S^1; Z) = 0 for k ≥ 2\n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology groups of the torus X = S^1 × S^1 using the Künneth formula:\n\nH^0(X; Z) = H^0(S^1; Z) ⊗ H^0(S^1; Z) = Z ⊗ Z = Z\n\nH^1(X; Z) = H^0(S^1; Z) ⊗ H^1(S^1; Z) ⊕ H^1(S^1; Z) ⊗ H^0(S^1; Z) = Z ⊗ Z ⊕ Z ⊗ Z = Z^2\n\nH^2(X; Z) = H^1(S^1; Z) ⊗ H^1(S^1; Z) = Z ⊗ Z = Z\n\nH^3(X; Z) = 0, since there are no nontrivial cohomology groups for the circle S^1 with degree greater than or equal to 2.\n\nSo, the cohomology groups of the torus X with integer coefficients are:\n\nH^0(X; Z) = Z\nH^1(X; Z) = Z^2\nH^2(X; Z) = Z\nH^3(X; Z) = 0"
