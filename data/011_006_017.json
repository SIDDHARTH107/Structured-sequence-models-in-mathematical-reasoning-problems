    "message_1": "How many ways are there to choose a committee of 5 people from a group of 10 candidates, if there are 3 women in the group and at least one woman must be on the committee? Use generating functions to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we'll first represent the number of ways to choose people from the group of 10 candidates as a polynomial. Let's represent the number of ways to choose men and women separately.\n\nThere are 7 men in the group, and we can choose 0 to 5 of them to be on the committee. The generating function for choosing men is:\n\nM(x) = 1 + 7x + 21x^2 + 35x^3 + 35x^4 + 21x^5\n\nThere are 3 women in the group, and since at least one woman must be on the committee, we can choose 1 to 3 of them. The generating function for choosing women is:\n\nW(x) = 3x + 3x^2 + x^3\n\nNow, we need to find the generating function for choosing a committee of 5 people with at least one woman. We can do this by multiplying the generating functions for men and women:\n\nC(x) = M(x) * W(x)\n\nC(x) = (1 + 7x + 21x^2 + 35x^3 + 35x^4 + 21x^5) * (3x + 3x^2 + x^3)\n\nNow, we'll multiply the polynomials and look for the coefficient of x^5, which represents the number of ways to choose a committee of 5 people with at least one woman:\n\nC(x) = 3x^2 + 24x^3 + 66x^4 + 111x^5 + ...\n\nThe coefficient of x^5 in C(x) is 111. Therefore, there are 111 ways to choose a committee of 5 people from a group of 10 candidates with at least one woman on the committee."
