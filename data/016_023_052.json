    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, at each iteration, the square is divided into 3x3 smaller squares, and the middle square and the four corner squares are filled. So, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces. The scaling factor is s = 3, as each side of the square is divided into three equal parts.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.465. Note that this value is independent of the number of levels of recursion."
