    "message_1": "A circular swimming pool has a diameter of 12 meters. What is the perimeter of the pool?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular pool, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference = π * diameter\n\nGiven the diameter of the pool is 12 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nCircumference = π * 12 meters\n\nUsing the approximate value of π as 3.14, we get:\n\nCircumference ≈ 3.14 * 12 meters\nCircumference ≈ 37.68 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the pool is approximately 37.68 meters."
