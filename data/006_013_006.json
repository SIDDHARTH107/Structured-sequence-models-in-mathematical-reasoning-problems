    "message_1": "A region has a 1 in 50 chance of experiencing a devastating earthquake in any given year. What is the probability that the region will experience at least one devastating earthquake in the next 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that the region will not experience any devastating earthquakes in the next 10 years and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of experiencing at least one devastating earthquake.\n\nThe probability of not experiencing a devastating earthquake in any given year is 49/50 (since there's a 1/50 chance of experiencing one). For the region to not experience any devastating earthquakes in the next 10 years, this would have to happen 10 times in a row.\n\nSo, the probability of not experiencing any devastating earthquakes in the next 10 years is (49/50)^10.\n\nNow, to find the probability of experiencing at least one devastating earthquake in the next 10 years, we subtract this probability from 1:\n\nProbability of at least one devastating earthquake = 1 - (49/50)^10\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\n(49/50)^10 ≈ 0.8174\n\n1 - 0.8174 ≈ 0.1826\n\nSo, the probability of the region experiencing at least one devastating earthquake in the next 10 years is approximately 0.1826, or 18.26%."
