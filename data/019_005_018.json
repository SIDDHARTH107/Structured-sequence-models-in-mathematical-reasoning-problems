Each friend knows whether or not they ordered a dessert, but they don't know whether or not anyone else did. The waiter comes back and says, \"at least one of you ordered dessert.\" What is the probability that each friend correctly identifies whether or not they ordered a dessert?",
    "message_2": "Since each friend knows whether or not they ordered a dessert, there is no uncertainty for them about their own dessert order. Therefore, the probability that each friend correctly identifies whether or not they ordered a dessert is 100% or 1."
