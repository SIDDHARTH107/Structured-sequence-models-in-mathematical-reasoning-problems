    "message_1": "Here's a question: \n\nSuppose you want to send a secret message to your friend using RSA encryption with a public key (n = 85, e = 11). Your friend provides you with their private key (d = 59). Encode the message \"HELLO\" as a single number using ASCII encoding and encrypt it using the given public key. What is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the message \"HELLO\" into a single number using ASCII encoding. The ASCII values for the characters are as follows:\n\nH - 72\nE - 69\nL - 76\nL - 76\nO - 79\n\nNow, we concatenate these values to form a single number: 7269767679.\n\nNext, we will use the RSA encryption formula to encrypt the message using the public key (n = 85, e = 11):\n\nC = M^e mod n\n\nwhere C is the encrypted message, M is the original message (7269767679), e is the encryption exponent (11), and n is the modulus (85).\n\nHowever, the message M is too large for the given modulus n. In practice, RSA encryption requires much larger values of n to ensure security. For this example, we cannot proceed with the encryption as the message is too large for the given public key."
