    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition method, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n    2x + 3y - 4z = -4\n    4x - 5y + z = -3\n    -2x + y - 3z = 18\n\nThe coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix B are:\n\nA = |  2   3  -4 |\n    |  4  -5   1 |\n    | -2   1  -3 |\n\nB = | -4 |\n    | -3 |\n    | 18 |\n\nNow, we perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\nL = |  1    0   0  |\n    |  2    1   0  |\n    | -1  -1   1  |\n\nU = |  2   3  -4  |\n    |  0  -11  9  |\n    |  0   0   2  |\n\nNow, we solve the system LY = B for Y:\n\n1.
