    "message_2": "To check if the system has infinitely many solutions, we can first check if the equations are linearly dependent. If they are, then the system has either no solutions or infinitely many solutions. We can do this by checking if one equation can be obtained by multiplying another equation by a constant.\n\nLet's look at the given equations:\n\n1) 2x + 3y - z = 7\n2) 4x + 6y - 2z = 14\n3) 6x + 9y - 3z = 21\n\nWe can see that equation (2) is just equation (1) multiplied by 2:\n\n2 * (2x + 3y - z) = 2 * 7\n4x + 6y - 2z = 14\n\nSimilarly, equation (3) is equation (1) multiplied by 3:\n\n3 * (2x + 3y - z) = 3 * 7\n6x + 9y - 3z = 21\n\nSince the equations are linearly dependent, the system has either no solutions or infinitely many solutions. Now, let's check if the system is consistent (i.e., has at least one solution). We can do this by checking if the augmented matrix of the system has the same rank as the coefficient matrix.\n\nThe augmented matrix of the system is:\n\n| 2  3 -1 | 7\n| 4  6 -2 | 14\n| 6  9 -3 | 21\n\nWe can perform Gaussian elimination to row reduce the matrix:\n\n1) Divide the first row by 2:\n\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 | 7/2\n| 4  6  -2   | 14\n| 6  9  -3   | 21\n\n2) Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 |  7/2\n| 0  0    0   |  0\n| 6  9  -3   |  21\n\n3) Subtract 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 |  7/2\n| 0  0    0   |  0\n| 0  0    0   |  0\n\nThe rank of the augmented matrix is 1, and the rank of the coefficient matrix is also 1. Since the ranks are equal, the system is consistent and has infinitely many solutions.\n\nNow, let's express the solution in terms of a free variable. We can rewrite equation (1) as:\n\nz = 2x + 3y - 7\n\nLet y = t, where t is a free variable. Then, we can express x and z in terms of t:\n\nx = (7 - 3t + z) / 2\n\nSubstituting y = t into the equation for z, we get:\n\nz = 2x + 3t - 7\n\nNow, we can express x, y, and z in terms of the free variable t:\n\nx = (7 - 3t + z) / 2\ny = t\nz = 2x + 3t - 7\n\nThis represents the infinitely many solutions of the given system of equations."
