    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. The first iteration of the Peano curve is constructed by dividing the initial straight line segment into three equal parts and replacing the middle segment with two segments of the same length, forming a U-shape.\n\nIn this case, the initial straight line segment has a length of 1 unit. After the first iteration, the curve consists of 4 segments, each with a length of 1/3 units. Therefore, the total length of the Peano curve after the first iteration is:\n\n4 * (1/3) = 4/3 units."
