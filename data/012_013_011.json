    "message_2": "A simple graph G with 5 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3 implies that G is a complete graph with 5 vertices, denoted as K5. The chromatic polynomial of a graph counts the number of proper colorings of the graph using at most k colors.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a complete graph K_n is given by the formula:\n\nP(K_n, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)...(k - n + 1)\n\nFor K5, n = 5, so the chromatic polynomial P(K5, k) is:\n\nP(K5, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)(k - 4)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G."
