    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is the largest connected region in the set, and it has a parametric equation given by:\n\nc(t) = (1/2) * (1 - cos(t)) * e^(it), where t is in the range [0, 2π].\n\nTo find the area of the main cardioid, we can use the polar coordinate system. The equation of the main cardioid in polar coordinates is given by:\n\nr(θ) = 1 - cos(θ), where θ is in the range [0, 2π].\n\nTo find the area, we can integrate the square of the radius with respect to θ and multiply by 1/2:\n\nArea = (1/2) * ∫[0, 2π] (1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ\n\nLet's evaluate the integral:\n\n∫(1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ = ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + cos^2(θ)) dθ\n\nNow, we can use the power-reduction formula for cos^2(θ):\n\ncos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + (1 + cos(2θ))/2) dθ\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫1 dθ - 2∫cos(θ) dθ + (1/2)∫(1 + cos(2θ)) dθ\n\nThe antiderivatives are:\n\nθ - 2sin(θ) + (1/2)(θ + (1/2)sin(2θ))\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the limits 0 and 2π:\n\n[2π - 2sin(2π) + (1/2)(2π + (1/2)sin(4π))] - [0 - 2sin(0) + (1/2)(0 + (1/2)sin(0))]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(2π + π)/2 = (3π)/2\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is (3π)/2 square units."
