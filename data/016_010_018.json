    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly applying the Descartes Circle Theorem. The Descartes Circle Theorem states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures (k1, k2, k3, k4), the following equation holds:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k1 * k3 + k1 * k4 + k2 * k3 + k2 * k4 + k3 * k4)\n\nCurvature (k) is defined as the reciprocal of the radius (r): k = 1/r.\n\nGiven that the first circle has a radius of 1, its curvature is k1 = 1. We will now find the curvatures of the next five circles.\n\nLet's denote the curvatures of the next five circles as k2, k3, k4, k5, and k6. The first three circles are mutually tangent, so we can apply the Descartes Circle Theorem to find k2:\n\n1 + k2 + k2 + k2 = 2 * sqrt(1 * k2 + 1 * k2 + 1 * k2 + k2 * k2 + k2 * k2 + k2 * k2)\n3 * k2 - 1 = 2 * sqrt(3 * k2 + 3 * k2^2)\n(3 * k2 - 1)^2 = 4 * (3 * k2 + 3 * k2^2)\n9 * k2^2 - 6 * k2 + 1 = 12 * k2 + 12 * k2^2\n3 * k2^2 - 18 * k2 + 1 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get two possible values for k2: k2 = 3 and k2 = 1/3. Since the circles in the Apollonian gasket get smaller, we choose k2 = 1/3. The radius of the second circle is r2 = 3.\n\nNow, we can find the curvatures of the next four circles using the Descartes Circle Theorem:\n\n1. For k3 (tangent to circles with curvatures 1, 1/3, and 1/3):\n1 + 1/3 + 1/3 + k3 = 2 * sqrt(1 * 1/3 + 1 * 1/3 + 1 * k3 + 1/3 * 1/3 + 1/3 * k3 + 1/3 * k3)\nk3 = 5/3\nr3 = 3/5\n\n2. For k4 (tangent to circles with curvatures 1, 1/3, and 5/3):\n1 + 1/3 + 5/3 + k4 = 2 * sqrt(1 * 1/3 + 1 * 5/3 + 1 * k4 + 1/3 * 5/3 + 1/3 * k4 + 5/3 * k4)\nk4 = 5\nr4 = 1/5\n\n3. For k5 (tangent to circles with curvatures 1, 5/3, and 5):\n1 + 5/3 + 5 + k5 = 2 * sqrt(1 * 5/3 + 1 * 5 + 1 * k5 + 5/3 * 5 + 5/3 * k5 + 5 * k5)\nk5 = 21/5\nr5 = 5/21\n\n4. For k6 (tangent to circles with curvatures 1/3, 5/3, and 5):\n1/3 + 5/3 + 5 + k6 = 2 * sqrt(1/3 * 5/3 + 1/3 * 5 + 1/3 * k6 + 5/3 * 5 + 5/3 * k6 + 5 * k6)\nk6 = 37/15\nr6 = 15/37\n\nThe sum of the radii of the first six circles is:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 + r4 + r5 + r6 = 1 + 3 + 3/5 + 1/5 + 5/21 + 15/37 â‰ˆ 4.8419"
