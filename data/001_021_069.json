    "message_2": "To find all possible solutions for the given cubic equation 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0, we can use either factoring or numerical methods. In this case, we will use factoring.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-3) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (2). The factors of -3 are ±1, ±3, and the factors of 2 are ±1, ±2. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±3, ±1/2, and ±3/2.\n\nNow, let's test these possible roots:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n2(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 - 2(1) - 3 = 2 + 3 - 2 - 3 = 0. So, x = 1 is a root.\n\nNow that we have found a root, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor.\n\nSynthetic division with x = 1:\n\n```\n1 |  2  3  -2  -3\n     +  2   1   1\n  ----------------\n      2  5  -1  -2\n```\n\nThe result of the synthetic division is a quadratic equation: 2x^2 + 5x - 2.\n\nNow, let's solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -2.\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(2)(-2))) / 2(2)\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 16)) / 4\nx = (-5 ± √41) / 4\n\nSo, the remaining two solutions are x = (-5 + √41) / 4 and x = (-5 - √41) / 4.\n\nThus, the three solutions for the equation 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 are:\n\nx = 1, x = (-5 + √41) / 4, and x = (-5 - √41) / 4."
