    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, player 1 is given $100 and must propose a division of the money between themselves and player 2. If player 2 accepts the proposal, each player gets their share of the money as proposed. However, if player 2 rejects the proposal, neither player gets any money. What is the highest amount player 1 can offer player 2 to maximize the chances of having their proposal accepted?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the highest amount player 1 can offer player 2 to maximize the chances of having their proposal accepted depends on the rationality and preferences of player 2. If player 2 is perfectly rational and only cares about maximizing their own monetary gain, then player 1 can offer any amount greater than $0, as player 2 would prefer any amount of money over nothing.\n\nHowever, in practice, people often have fairness preferences and may reject offers that they perceive as unfair. To maximize the chances of having their proposal accepted, player 1 should offer an amount that is perceived as fair by player 2. A common benchmark for fairness is an equal split, so offering $50 to player 2 would likely maximize the chances of acceptance. However, it's important to note that individual preferences may vary, and there is no guarantee that any specific offer will be accepted."
