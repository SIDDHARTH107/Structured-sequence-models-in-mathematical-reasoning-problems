    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company produces 1,000,000 units of a product every month, and on average, 0.2% of the units produced are defective. What is the probability that in a given month, there will be exactly 2,000 defective units produced?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of units produced (1,000,000)\n- k is the number of defective units we want to find the probability for (2,000)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (0.2% = 0.002)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a unit not being defective (1 - 0.002 = 0.998)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 2000) = C(1,000,000, 2,000) * (0.002)^2,000 * (0.998)^(1,000,000-2,000)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(1,000,000, 2,000):\n\nC(1,000,000, 2,000) = 1,000,000! / (2,000!(1,000,000-2,000)!)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nC(1,000,000, 2,000) ≈ 2.7018 × 10^(-7)\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.002)^2,000 and (0.998)^(1,000,000-2,000):\n\n(0.002)^2,000 ≈ 1.3839 × 10^(-3010)\n(0.998)^(998,000) ≈ 0.1353\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2000) ≈ 2.7018 × 10^(-7) * 1.3839 × 10^(-3010) * 0.1353\nP(X = 2000) ≈ 5.102 × 10^(-3017)\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 2,000 defective units in a given month is approximately 5.102 × 10^(-3017), which is an extremely small probability."
