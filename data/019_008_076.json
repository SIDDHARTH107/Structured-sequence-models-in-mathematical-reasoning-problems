    "message_1": "A manufacturer is producing light bulbs with a target lifespan of 10,000 hours. The lifespan of a bulb is represented by a number between 0 and 10,000, with 0 indicating immediate failure and 10,000 indicating perfect lifespan. Using fuzzy logic, design a system that assigns a degree of membership to each bulb lifespan in terms of \"poor\", \"fair\", \"good\", or \"excellent\" quality. For example, a lifespan of 9,000 would have a high degree of membership in the \"excellent\" category, while a lifespan of 2,000 would have a low degree of membership in the \"poor\" category.",
    "message_2": "To design a fuzzy logic system for this problem, we can define four fuzzy sets for the quality categories: poor, fair, good, and excellent. We will use trapezoidal membership functions to represent these sets. The membership functions will be defined as follows:\n\n1. Poor (P): \n- Lifespan <= 2,000 hours: membership = 1\n- 2,000 < Lifespan <= 4,000 hours: membership = (4,000 - Lifespan) / 2,000\n- Lifespan > 4,000 hours: membership = 0\n\n2. Fair (F): \n- Lifespan <= 2,000 hours or Lifespan >= 6,000 hours: membership = 0\n- 2,000 < Lifespan <= 4,000 hours: membership = (Lifespan - 2,000) / 2,000\n- 4,000 < Lifespan <= 6,000 hours: membership = (6,000 - Lifespan) / 2,000\n\n3. Good (G): \n- Lifespan <= 4,000 hours or Lifespan >= 8,000 hours: membership = 0\n- 4,000 < Lifespan <= 6,000 hours: membership = (Lifespan - 4,000) / 2,000\n- 6,000 < Lifespan <= 8,000 hours: membership = (8,000 - Lifespan) / 2,000\n\n4. Excellent (E): \n- Lifespan <= 6,000 hours: membership = 0\n- 6,000 < Lifespan <= 8,000 hours: membership = (Lifespan - 6,000) / 2,000\n- Lifespan > 8,000 hours: membership = 1\n\nNow, given a bulb lifespan (L), we can calculate its degree of membership in each category using the membership functions defined above. For example, if L = 9,000 hours, the degrees of membership would be:\n\n- P(9,000) = 0\n- F(9,000) = 0\n- G(9,000) = 0\n- E(9,000) = 1\n\nSo, a bulb with a lifespan of 9,000 hours would have a high degree of membership in the \"excellent\" category."
