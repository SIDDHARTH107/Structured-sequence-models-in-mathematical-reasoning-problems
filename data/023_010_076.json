    "message_2": "To apply the 2D discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to a 512 x 512 pixel image, we first need the image data. Since the image data is not provided, I will describe the general process to find the frequency components and the magnitude of the coefficient with the highest frequency component.\n\nThe 2D DFT is given by the formula:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ[Σ[f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (ux/M + vy/N))]], where u = 0, 1, ..., M-1 and v = 0, 1, ..., N-1\n\nHere, f(x, y) represents the pixel intensity at position (x, y) in the image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (512 x 512 in this case), and F(u, v) is the Fourier coefficient at frequency (u, v).\n\n1. Compute the 2D DFT of the image using the formula above or a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which is more computationally efficient.\n\n2. Calculate the magnitude of each Fourier coefficient F(u, v) using the formula:\n\n|F(u, v)| = sqrt(Re(F(u, v))^2 + Im(F(u, v))^2)\n\nwhere Re(F(u, v)) and Im(F(u, v)) are the real and imaginary parts of F(u, v), respectively.\n\n3. Find the maximum magnitude and its corresponding frequency components (u, v) by iterating through all the calculated magnitudes.\n\nWithout the actual image data, it is not possible to provide the specific magnitude of the coefficient with the highest frequency component. However, following the steps above will allow you to determine the frequency components present in the image and the magnitude of the coefficient with the highest frequency component once you have the image data."
