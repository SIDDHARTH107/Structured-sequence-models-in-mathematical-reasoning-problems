    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn this case, p = 13 (a prime number) and a = 7. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, 7¹³ ≡ 7 (mod 13). \n\nNow, we can rewrite 7⁹ as (7⁴)² * 7¹. \n\nSince 7¹³ ≡ 7 (mod 13), we can raise both sides of the congruence to the power of 4: (7¹³)⁴ ≡ 7⁴ (mod 13). \n\nNow, we have (7⁴)¹³ ≡ 7⁴ (mod 13). \n\nNext, we can raise both sides of the congruence to the power of 2: ((7⁴)¹³)² ≡ (7⁴)² (mod 13). \n\nNow, we have (7⁴)²⁶ ≡ (7⁴)² (mod 13). \n\nSince 7⁹ = (7⁴)² * 7¹, we can multiply both sides of the congruence by 7: (7⁴)²⁶ * 7 ≡ (7⁴)² * 7¹ (mod 13). \n\nNow, we have 7²⁶ * 7 ≡ 7⁹ (mod 13). \n\nTo find the remainder when 7⁹ is divided by 13, we can calculate 7⁹ (mod 13):\n\n7⁹ ≡ (7⁴)² * 7¹ (mod 13)\n≡ ((7⁴)¹³)² * 7¹ (mod 13)\n≡ (7¹³)² * 7¹ (mod 13)\n≡ (7)² * 7¹ (mod 13)\n≡ 49 * 7 (mod 13)\n≡ 343 (mod 13)\n\nThe remainder when 343 is divided by 13 is 3. Therefore, the remainder when 7⁹ is divided by 13 is 3."
