    "message_1": "A radio station broadcasts a sine wave signal with a frequency of 1000 Hz. What is the frequency spectrum of this signal as shown by Fourier transform?",
    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a sine wave signal is a pair of impulses (also known as Dirac delta functions) located at the positive and negative frequency of the sine wave. In this case, the sine wave has a frequency of 1000 Hz. Therefore, the frequency spectrum of this signal as shown by the Fourier transform will have impulses at +1000 Hz and -1000 Hz."
