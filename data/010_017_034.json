The problem can be: \n\n\"Consider a closed surface with genus 2 (having two holes), and let the critical points of a Morse function on this surface be x0, x1, x2, and x3, with index 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively. If the number of critical points of each index is 1, 6, 13, and 8 respectively, what is the Euler characteristic of the surface? Show your work.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of the surface, we can use the Morse inequalities and the fact that the Euler characteristic can be computed as the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index.\n\nThe Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index i is greater than or equal to the i-th Betti number, denoted by b_i. In this case, we have the following inequalities:\n\nb_0 <= 1\nb_1 <= 6\nb_2 <= 13\nb_3 <= 8\n\nFor a closed surface of genus 2, we know that the Betti numbers are b_0 = 1, b_1 = 2, and b_2 = 1 (since it has two holes). There is no b_3 term because the surface is 2-dimensional, so b_3 = 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic (χ) using the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index:\n\nχ = (# of index 0 critical points) - (# of index 1 critical points) + (# of index 2 critical points) - (# of index 3 critical points)\nχ = 1 - 6 + 13 - 8\nχ = -5 + 5\nχ = 0\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the closed surface with genus 2 is 0."
