    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative of the given 2-form $\\omega = e^x \\sin(y) dx \\wedge dy$, we need to apply the exterior derivative operator $d$ to $\\omega$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a $k$-form is a $(k+1)$-form, and it is defined as follows:\n\n$d(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\omega_i}{\\partial x^j} dx^j \\wedge dx^i$\n\nIn our case, $\\omega = e^x \\sin(y) dx \\wedge dy$, so we have only one term to consider:\n\n$d(\\omega) = \\frac{\\partial (e^x \\sin(y))}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dx + \\frac{\\partial (e^x \\sin(y))}{\\partial y} dy \\wedge dy$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (e^x \\sin(y))}{\\partial x} = e^x \\sin(y)$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (e^x \\sin(y))}{\\partial y} = e^x \\cos(y)$\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $d(\\omega)$, we get:\n\n$d(\\omega) = e^x \\sin(y) dx \\wedge dx + e^x \\cos(y) dy \\wedge dy$\n\nHowever, since $dx \\wedge dx = 0$ and $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, we have:\n\n$d(\\omega) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ on $M$ is 0."
