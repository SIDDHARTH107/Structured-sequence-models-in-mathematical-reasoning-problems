    "message_2": "In a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, there are 3 options for each player: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Since each player chooses their option independently, there are a total of 3 x 3 = 9 possible outcomes for the game.\n\nThere are 3 outcomes where both players choose the same option: Rock-Rock, Paper-Paper, and Scissors-Scissors.\n\nThe probability of both players tying by choosing the same option is the number of tie outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of tie outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 3 / 9 = 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 or 33.33%."
