    "message_1": "A solar power system has five inverters. Each inverter will fail independently within 2 years with probability 0.2. What is the probability that at least two inverters fail within 2 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability that at least two inverters fail, we will find the probability that none or only one inverter fails, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability that none of the inverters fail within 2 years. Since each inverter fails with a probability of 0.2, the probability that an inverter does not fail is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. Since the inverters fail independently, the probability that none of them fail is the product of the probabilities that each inverter does not fail:\n\nP(None fail) = 0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nNow, let's find the probability that exactly one inverter fails within 2 years. There are 5 different inverters that could be the one to fail. The probability that a specific inverter fails and the others do not is:\n\nP(1 fails, others don't) = 0.2 * 0.8^4 = 0.08192\n\nSince there are 5 different inverters that could be the one to fail, the total probability that exactly one inverter fails is:\n\nP(Exactly 1 fails) = 5 * P(1 fails, others don't) = 5 * 0.08192 = 0.4096\n\nNow we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(At least 2 fail) = 1 - P(None fail) - P(Exactly 1 fails) = 1 - 0.32768 - 0.4096 = 0.26272\n\nSo, the probability that at least two inverters fail within 2 years is approximately 0.26272 or 26.27%."
