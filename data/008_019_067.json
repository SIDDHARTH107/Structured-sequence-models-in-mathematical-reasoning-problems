    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, let's use the elimination method. First, we can multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\nFirst equation * 4:\n12x + 8yi = 40 + 16i\n\nSecond equation * 3:\n12x - 15yi = -15 - 27i\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x:\n\n(12x + 8yi) - (12x - 15yi) = (40 + 16i) - (-15 - 27i)\n\n12x + 8yi - 12x + 15yi = 40 + 16i + 15 + 27i\n\n23yi = 55 + 43i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 23 to find y:\n\ny = (55 + 43i) / 23\n\ny = 55/23 + 43i/23\n\ny = 5/3 + 43i/23\n\nNow that we have found y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find x. Let's use the first equation:\n\n3x + 2(5/3 + 43i/23)i = 10 + 4i\n\n3x + 10/3i + 86i^2/23 = 10 + 4i\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we have:\n\n3x - 86/23 + 10/3i = 10 + 4i\n\nNow, separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n3x - 86/23 = 10\n10/3i = 4i\n\nSolve for x:\n\n3x = 10 + 86/23\n\n3x = (230 + 86) / 23\n\n3x = 316/23\n\nx = 316/69\n\nNow, solve for the imaginary part:\n\n10/3i = 4i\n\n10 = 12i\n\ni = 10/12\n\ni = 5/6\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 316/69\ny = 5/3 + 43i/23"
