    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function y = 4cos(2x + π/4), we need to analyze the function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a cosine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the cosine term. In this case, the amplitude is |4| = 4.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a cosine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the cosine function. The general formula for the period of a cosine function is (2π)/|B|, where B is the coefficient of the x term. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π)/|2| = (2π)/2 = π.\n\nThus, the amplitude of the function y = 4cos(2x + π/4) is 4, and the period is π."
