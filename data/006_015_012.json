    "message_1": "What is the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network in a given year, if the historical data shows that the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a daily basis is 0.05%? Assume that the network is operational every day of the year.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network in a given year, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability of an event not occurring, which is 1 minus the probability of the event occurring.\n\nIn this case, the probability of a ransomware attack not occurring on a daily basis is:\n\n1 - 0.0005 = 0.9995\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of a ransomware attack not occurring for the entire year (365 days). We can do this by raising the daily probability to the power of the number of days:\n\n0.9995 ^ 365 ≈ 0.8318\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability of a ransomware attack occurring at least once in a year:\n\n1 - 0.8318 ≈ 0.1682\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network in a given year is approximately 16.82%."
