    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. The production of X requires 3 units of raw material and 4 units of labor, while the production of Y requires 2 units of raw material and 5 units of labor. The company has 120 units of raw material and 100 units of labor available. The profit per unit of X is $5 and for Y is $7. Formulate the linear programming model to maximize the profit for the company. Use matrix methods to solve the linear programming problem. \n\nWhat is the optimal production quantity for X and Y, and what is the maximum profit that the company can make?",
    "message_2": "To formulate the linear programming model, we need to define the variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 5x + 7y\n\nConstraints (raw material and labor):\n3x + 2y ≤ 120 (raw material constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we will use the matrix method to solve the linear programming problem.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the constraints in the standard form Ax ≤ b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 4  5 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n\nb = | 120 |\n    | 100 |\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and identifying the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe constraints are:\nx = 0\ny = 0\n3x + 2y = 120\n4x + 5y = 100\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 20)\nC(20, 0)\nD(40/3, 80/3)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 7y at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nP(A) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\nP(B) = 5(0) + 7(20) = 140\nP(C) = 5(20) + 7(0) = 100\nP(D) = 5(40/3) + 7(80/3) = 200\n\nThe maximum profit is $200, which occurs at vertex D with the optimal production quantities x = 40/3 units of product X and y = 80/3 units of product Y."
