(A × B) △ B\nTo find the symmetric difference between (A × B) and B, we need to find the elements that are in either (A × B) or B, but not in both. Since B contains single elements and (A × B) contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements. Therefore, the symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), 2, 3}\n\n2. A × (B △ B)\nSince B △ B is an empty set, the Cartesian product of A and an empty set will also be an empty set:\nA × (B △ B) = {}\n\n3. (A △ B) × B\nNow we find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and B:\n(A △ B) × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}"
