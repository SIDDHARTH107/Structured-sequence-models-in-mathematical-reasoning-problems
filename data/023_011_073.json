    "message_2": "To find the frequency content of the sound wave using the Fourier transform, we first need to understand the basics of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is a mathematical technique that transforms a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. In this case, we have a sound wave recorded over a time period of 5 seconds with a sample rate of 44,100 Hz.\n\nThe first step is to determine the total number of samples in the recording. We can calculate this by multiplying the sample rate by the duration of the recording:\n\nTotal samples = Sample rate × Time duration\nTotal samples = 44,100 Hz × 5 s\nTotal samples = 220,500\n\nNow, we can apply the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the recorded samples. The DFT is defined as:\n\nX(k) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * n / N)]\n\nwhere X(k) is the k-th frequency component, x(n) is the n-th sample in the time domain, N is the total number of samples, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nApplying the DFT to the recorded samples will give us a set of complex numbers representing the frequency content of the sound wave. The magnitude of each complex number corresponds to the amplitude of the corresponding frequency component, and the phase angle corresponds to the phase shift of that frequency component.\n\nTo find the frequency content, we need to calculate the frequency resolution, which is the difference in frequency between adjacent DFT bins. The frequency resolution can be calculated as:\n\nFrequency resolution = Sample rate / Total samples\nFrequency resolution = 44,100 Hz / 220,500\nFrequency resolution ≈ 0.2 Hz\n\nNow, we can find the frequency content by multiplying the frequency resolution by the index of each DFT bin. For example, the frequency content of the first bin (k=0) is 0 Hz, the second bin (k=1) is 0.2 Hz, the third bin (k=2) is 0.4 Hz, and so on.\n\nIn summary, to find the frequency content of the sound wave, we need to apply the Discrete Fourier Transform to the recorded samples and then calculate the frequency content for each DFT bin using the frequency resolution."
