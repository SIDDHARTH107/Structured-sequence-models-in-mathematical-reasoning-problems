    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation with the given potential and boundary conditions, we first rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$-\\frac{h^2}{2m}\\Psi''(x) + (5x^2 + 3)\\Psi(x) = 4\\Psi(x)$$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to isolate the second derivative of the wavefunction:\n\n$$\\Psi''(x) = \\frac{2m}{h^2} (4 - 5x^2 - 3)\\Psi(x)$$\n\n$$\\Psi''(x) = \\frac{2m}{h^2} (1 - 5x^2)\\Psi(x)$$\n\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation. To solve it, we can make an ansatz (educated guess) for the solution. Since the potential is a quadratic function, we can try a polynomial ansatz for the wavefunction:\n\n$$\\Psi(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C$$\n\nNow, we find the second derivative of the ansatz:\n\n$$\\Psi''(x) = 2A$$\n\nSubstituting the ansatz and its second derivative into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n$$2A = \\frac{2m}{h^2} (1 - 5x^2)(Ax^2 + Bx + C)$$\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of the powers of x on both sides of the equation:\n\nFor $x^2$ term:\n$$0 = -5A\\frac{2m}{h^2}$$\n\nFor $x$ term:\n$$0 = B\\frac{2m}{h^2}$$\n\nFor the constant term:\n$$2A = C\\frac{2m}{h^2}$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $B = 0$. From the first equation, we can conclude that either $A = 0$ or $m = 0$ or $h^2 = \\infty$. Since $m$ and $h^2$ are non-zero physical constants, we must have $A = 0$. Finally, from the third equation, we get $C = 0$. \n\nThus, the ansatz reduces to the trivial solution:\n\n$$\\Psi(x) = 0$$\n\nHowever, this solution does not provide any physical insight into the problem. The Schrödinger equation with the given potential and boundary conditions does not have a non-trivial polynomial solution. To find a non-trivial solution, one would need to use more advanced techniques, such as numerical methods or perturbation theory."
