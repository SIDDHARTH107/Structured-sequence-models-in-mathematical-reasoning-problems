    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform the actual MD5 hashing process. However, I can guide you on how to do it.\n\nTo find the hash value H(M) of a 128-bit message M using the MD5 cryptographic hash function, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Pre-processing: Pad the message M with a '1' bit followed by '0' bits until the length of the message is congruent to 448 modulo 512. Then, append a 64-bit representation of the original message length (before padding) to the end of the padded message.\n\n2. Divide the pre-processed message into 512-bit blocks.\n\n3. Initialize the MD5 hash function's internal state with four 32-bit words: A, B, C, and D. These words are usually predefined constants.\n\n4. Process each 512-bit block using the MD5 main algorithm, which consists of four rounds. Each round has 16 operations that use non-linear functions, modular arithmetic, and bitwise operations to update the internal state (A, B, C, and D).\n\n5. After processing all the blocks, the final internal state (A, B, C, and D) is concatenated to form the 128-bit hash value H(M).\n\nTo compute the MD5 hash of a message, you can use various programming languages or online tools. In Python, you can use the `hashlib` library:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef md5_hash(message):\n    md5 = hashlib.md5()\n    md5.update(message.encode('utf-8'))\n    return md5.hexdigest()\n\nmessage = \"your_message_here\"\nhash_value = md5_hash(message)\nprint(\"MD5 Hash Value:\", hash_value)\n```\n\nReplace \"your_message_here\" with the 128-bit message you want to hash. Note that this code assumes the message is a string, so you may need to adjust it if your message is in a different format."
