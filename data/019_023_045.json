    "message_2": "The given sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. To find the next 3 numbers in the sequence, we can add the common difference to the last known term, successively.\n\nThe last known term is 8. \n\n1st next number: 8 + 2 = 10\n2nd next number: 10 + 2 = 12\n3rd next number: 12 + 2 = 14\n\nSo, the next 3 numbers in the sequence are 10, 12, and 14."
