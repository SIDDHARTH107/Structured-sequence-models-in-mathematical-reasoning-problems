    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean using the bootstrapping method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample the data with replacement to create a new sample of the same size (25 scores).\n2. Calculate the mean of the resampled data.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (e.g., 1000 times) to create a distribution of resampled means.\n4. Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of resampled means, which represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince I am an AI language model and cannot perform actual resampling and calculations, I will provide you with a general formula to estimate the confidence interval using the sample mean and standard deviation.\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the formula is:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (1.96 * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nGiven the sample mean (78) and standard deviation (10) for the 25 scores:\n\nConfidence Interval = 78 ± (1.96 * (10 / √25))\nConfidence Interval = 78 ± (1.96 * (10 / 5))\nConfidence Interval = 78 ± (1.96 * 2)\nConfidence Interval = 78 ± 3.92\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (74.08, 81.92).\n\nKeep in mind that this is an estimation using the sample mean and standard deviation, not the bootstrapping method. To get the bootstrapped confidence interval, you would need to follow the steps mentioned earlier and perform the resampling process."
