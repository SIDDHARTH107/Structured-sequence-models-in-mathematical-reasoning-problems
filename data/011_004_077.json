    "message_1": "A school has 10 students and needs to divide them into three groups for a project. How many ways can they divide the students if one group has 3 students, one group has 4 students, and one group has 3 students? (Hint: Use multinomial coefficients)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula, which is:\n\nn! / (k1! * k2! * ... * km!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, and k1, k2, ..., km are the sizes of the groups.\n\nIn this case, n = 10, k1 = 3, k2 = 4, and k3 = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n10! / (3! * 4! * 3!)\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n10! = 3,628,800\n3! = 6\n4! = 24\n3! = 6\n\nNow, divide the factorials:\n\n3,628,800 / (6 * 24 * 6) = 3,628,800 / 864 = 4,200\n\nSo, there are 4,200 ways to divide the 10 students into groups of 3, 4, and 3."
