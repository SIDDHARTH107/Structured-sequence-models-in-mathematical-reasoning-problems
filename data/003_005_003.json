    "message_2": "To find the value of the inverse cosine of 0.5 (arccos(0.5)), we need to find the angle whose cosine is 0.5. In other words, we are looking for an angle θ such that:\n\ncos(θ) = 0.5\n\nWe know that the cosine function is positive in the first and fourth quadrants of the unit circle. Since the inverse cosine function has a range of [0, π] (0 to 180 degrees), we only need to consider the first and second quadrants.\n\nRecall the 30-60-90 triangle, which has angles of 30°, 60°, and 90°. In this triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:√3:2. Specifically, the cosine of 60° (π/3 radians) is 0.5:\n\ncos(60°) = cos(π/3) = 0.5\n\nTherefore, the value of the inverse cosine of 0.5 is:\n\narccos(0.5) = 60° = π/3 radians"
