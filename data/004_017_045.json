    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) between x = 0 and x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + (9/4)x, then du/dx = 9/4, and dx = (4/9)du.\n\nThe new integral becomes:\n\nL = ∫[1, 10] √(u) * (4/9) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2))[1, 10]\n\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (8/27) * (10√10 - 1)\n\nL ≈ 15.47\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 15.47."
