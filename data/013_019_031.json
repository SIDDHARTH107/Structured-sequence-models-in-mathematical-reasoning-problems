The contestant must choose one envelope without opening it. Before the contestant makes their selection, the host offers some \"cheap talk\" by saying, \"I can tell you that at least one of the envelopes contains more than $10,000.\" \n\nWhat should the contestant do? Should they stick with their original choice or switch to the other envelope? Use game theory to analyze the situation and determine the optimal strategy for the contestant.",
    "message_2": "In this situation, the host's \"cheap talk\" does not provide any new information to the contestant, as it was already known that one envelope contains $5,000 and the other contains $15,000. Therefore, the host's statement does not change the probabilities associated with each envelope.\n\nUsing game theory, we can analyze the situation as follows:\n\n1. The contestant chooses an envelope at random. The probability of choosing the $5,000 envelope is 1/2, and the probability of choosing the $15,000 envelope is also 1/2.\n\n2. The host makes the \"cheap talk\" statement, which does not provide any new information.\n\n3. The contestant must decide whether to stick with their original choice or switch to the other envelope. Since the host's statement did not change the probabilities, the probability of the chosen envelope containing $5,000 remains 1/2, and the probability of the chosen envelope containing $15,000 also remains 1/2.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal strategy for the contestant is to be indifferent between sticking with their original choice or switching to the other envelope, as the probabilities of winning $5,000 or $15,000 remain the same (1/2) regardless of their decision."
