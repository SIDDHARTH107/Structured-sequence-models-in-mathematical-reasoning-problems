    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartan connection 1-form $\\omega$, we first need to define the Cartan connection on the manifold $M$. The Cartan connection is a generalization of the Levi-Civita connection, which is determined by the Riemannian metric $g$ and the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$.\n\nLet $TM$ be the tangent bundle of $M$, and let $G$ be the orthogonal group of the Riemannian metric $g$. The Cartan connection is a $G$-valued 1-form on $TM$, which we denote by $\\omega$. The Cartan connection is determined by the following properties:\n\n1. For each point $p \\in M$, the restriction of $\\omega$ to the tangent space $T_pM$ is an isomorphism between $T_pM$ and the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$.\n\n2. For each vector field $X$ on $M$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X$ is given by the Lie algebra-valued 1-form $\\omega(X) = \\nabla_X \\omega$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartan connection 1-form $\\omega$ at a point $p$ on the manifold $M$, for a given Riemannian metric $g$ and Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$.\n\nLet $\\{e_i\\}$ be a local orthonormal frame of $TM$ around $p$, i.e., a set of vector fields such that $g(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Then, we can express the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$ in terms of the frame $\\{e_i\\}$ as follows:\n\n$$\\Gamma_{ij}^{k} = g(\\nabla_{e_i} e_j, e_k).$$\n\nNow, let $\\{e^i\\}$ be the dual coframe of $\\{e_i\\}$, i.e., a set of 1-forms such that $e^i(e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. Then, we can define the Cartan connection 1-form $\\omega$ by\n\n$$\\omega^k{}_i = \\Gamma_{ij}^{k} e^j.$$\n\nAt the point $p \\in M$, the Cartan connection 1-form $\\omega$ is given by\n\n$$\\omega_p^k{}_i = \\Gamma_{ij}^{k}(p) e^j(p).$$\n\nIn summary, the Cartan connection 1-form $\\omega$ at a point $p$ on the manifold $M$ is determined by the Riemannian metric $g$ and the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$, and can be calculated using a local orthonormal frame $\\{e_i\\}$ and its dual coframe $\\{e^i\\}$."
