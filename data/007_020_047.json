    "message_1": "Suppose you have a message \"HELLO\" that needs to be sent securely using RSA encryption. You choose the two prime numbers p=11 and q=17 as your keys. Determine the public key and private key for this encryption, and use them to encrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "To determine the public and private keys for RSA encryption, follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\nn = 11 * 17 = 187\n\n2. Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nφ(n) = (11-1) * (17-1) = 10 * 16 = 160\n\n3. Choose a public key exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1\nLet's choose e = 3 (since it is a common choice and satisfies the conditions)\n\n4. Compute the private key exponent d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1\nTo find d, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. In this case, d = 107 (since (3 * 107) % 160 = 1)\n\nNow we have the public key (e, n) = (3, 187) and the private key (d, n) = (107, 187).\n\nTo encrypt the message \"HELLO\", we first convert each letter to its ASCII value:\nH = 72, E = 69, L = 76, L = 76, O = 79\n\nNow, we encrypt each value using the public key (e, n):\nCiphertext = (Plaintext^e) % n\n72^3 % 187 = 47\n69^3 % 187 = 32\n76^3 % 187 = 123\n76^3 % 187 = 123\n79^3 % 187 = 25\n\nThe encrypted message is: 47, 32, 123, 123, 25\n\nTo decrypt the message, we use the private key (d, n):\nPlaintext = (Ciphertext^d) % n\n47^107 % 187 = 72\n32^107 % 187 = 69\n123^107 % 187 = 76\n123^107 % 187 = 76\n25^107 % 187 = 79\n\nThe decrypted message is: 72, 69, 76, 76, 79, which corresponds to the original message \"HELLO\"."
