    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(3x + 1)(x + 3) = 2(x - 5)\n\nNow, we distribute:\n\n3x^2 + 9x + x + 3 = 2x - 10\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x^2 + 10x + 3 = 2x - 10\n\nMove all terms to one side of the equation:\n\n3x^2 + 8x + 13 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 8, and c = 13:\n\nx = (-8 ± √(8^2 - 4(3)(13))) / 2(3)\n\nx = (-8 ± √(64 - 156)) / 6\n\nx = (-8 ± √(-92)) / 6\n\nSince the discriminant (the value inside the square root) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. The equation has two complex solutions:\n\nx = (-8 + √(-92)i) / 6\nx = (-8 - √(-92)i) / 6"
