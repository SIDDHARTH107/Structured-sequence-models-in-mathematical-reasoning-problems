    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the ellipsoid at the point (a, 0, 0), we first need to find the normal vector at this point. The gradient of the ellipsoid function will give us the normal vector:\n\nâˆ‡f(x, y, z) = (2x/a^2, 2y/b^2, 2z/c^2)\n\nAt the point (a, 0, 0), the normal vector is:\n\nN = (2a/a^2, 0, 0) = (2/a, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the second fundamental form matrix (also known as the shape operator matrix). The elements of this matrix are given by the second derivatives of the ellipsoid function:\n\nf_xx = 2/a^2, f_yy = 2/b^2, f_zz = 2/c^2\nf_xy = f_yx = 0, f_xz = f_zx = 0, f_yz = f_zy = 0\n\nSo, the second fundamental form matrix is:\n\n| 2/a^2  0    0  |\n| 0    2/b^2  0  |\n| 0    0    2/c^2 |\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues of this matrix, which represent the principal curvatures. Since the matrix is diagonal, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal elements:\n\nk1 = 2/a^2\nk2 = 2/b^2\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the ellipsoid at the point (a, 0, 0) are 2/a^2 and 2/b^2."
