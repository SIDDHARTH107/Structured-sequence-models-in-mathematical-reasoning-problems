    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the given algebraic curve, we first need to find its singular points and then perform a birational transformation to remove them. \n\nThe given equation is $y^2 = x^3 - 3x^2$. Let's find the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -6x + 3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nA singular point occurs when both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$-6x + 3x^2 = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nSolving the first equation for $x$, we get:\n\n$x(3x - 6) = 0$\n\n$x = 0$ or $x = 2$\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the original equation to find the corresponding $y$ values:\n\nFor $x = 0$:\n\n$y^2 = 0^3 - 3(0)^2$\n\n$y^2 = 0$\n\n$y = 0$\n\nFor $x = 2$:\n\n$y^2 = 2^3 - 3(2)^2$\n\n$y^2 = 8 - 12$\n\n$y^2 = -4$\n\nSince we are considering the real projective plane, there is no real solution for $y$ when $x = 2$. Therefore, the only singular point is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to perform a birational transformation to remove the singular point. One way to do this is by using a change of coordinates. Let's consider the following transformation:\n\n$u = x$\n\n$v = y + x^2$\n\nNow, we need to express $y$ and $x$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:\n\n$x = u$\n\n$y = v - u^2$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the original equation, we get:\n\n$(v - u^2)^2 = u^3 - 3u^2$\n\n$v^2 - 2u^2v + u^4 = u^3 - 3u^2$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$u^4 - u^3 + 2u^2v - 3u^2 + v^2 = 0$\n\nNow, let's check if the singular point $(0, 0)$ is still present in the transformed equation:\n\nFor $u = 0$ and $v = 0$:\n\n$0^4 - 0^3 + 2(0)^2(0) - 3(0)^2 + 0^2 = 0$\n\nThis equation is not satisfied, which means the singular point has been removed.\n\nThus, the minimal model of the given curve is:\n\n$u^4 - u^3 + 2u^2v - 3u^2 + v^2 = 0$"
