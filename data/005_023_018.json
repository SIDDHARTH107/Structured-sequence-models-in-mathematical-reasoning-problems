    "message_2": "First, we need to find the first quartile (Q1), the third quartile (Q3), and the interquartile range (IQR).\n\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order:\n{18, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 36, 37, 40, 42, 75, 82}\n\nStep 2: Find Q1 (the median of the lower half) and Q3 (the median of the upper half):\nThere are 14 data points, so the lower half has 7 data points: {18, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31}\nThe upper half also has 7 data points: {33, 36, 37, 40, 42, 75, 82}\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half: (25 + 27) / 2 = 26\nQ3 is the median of the upper half: (40 + 42) / 2 = 41\n\nStep 3: Calculate the IQR:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 41 - 26 = 15\n\nStep 4: Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 26 - 1.5 * 15 = 26 - 22.5 = 3.5\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 41 + 1.5 * 15 = 41 + 22.5 = 63.5\n\nStep 5: Determine if 82 is an outlier:\nSince 82 is greater than the upper bound (63.5), it is considered an outlier."
