    "message_2": "To find the value of x in degrees using the inverse trigonometric function, we can use the arccosine (cos^(-1)) function:\n\nx = cos^(-1)(0.5)\n\nUsing a calculator or a reference table, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 60°\n\nHowever, since the cosine function is periodic with a period of 360°, there is another angle in the range of 0° to 360° that also has a cosine value of 0.5. This angle can be found by subtracting the first angle from 360°:\n\n360° - 60° = 300°\n\nSo, there are two possible values for x in the range of 0° to 360°:\n\nx ≈ 60° or x ≈ 300°"
