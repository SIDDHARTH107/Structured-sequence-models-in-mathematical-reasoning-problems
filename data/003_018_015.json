    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = sin(7x) - 3cos(4x) + 5tan(2x) with respect to x, we will apply the chain rule and the derivatives of sin, cos, and tan functions.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of each term in the function:\n\n1. Derivative of sin(7x):\nThe derivative of sin(u) is cos(u), where u is a function of x.\nSo, the derivative of sin(7x) is cos(7x) times the derivative of the inner function 7x, which is 7.\nHence, the derivative of sin(7x) is 7cos(7x).\n\n2. Derivative of -3cos(4x):\nThe derivative of cos(u) is -sin(u), where u is a function of x.\nSo, the derivative of -3cos(4x) is -3(-sin(4x)) times the derivative of the inner function 4x, which is 4.\nHence, the derivative of -3cos(4x) is 12sin(4x).\n\n3. Derivative of 5tan(2x):\nThe derivative of tan(u) is sec^2(u), where u is a function of x.\nSo, the derivative of 5tan(2x) is 5sec^2(2x) times the derivative of the inner function 2x, which is 2.\nHence, the derivative of 5tan(2x) is 10sec^2(2x).\n\nNow, let's combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\ndy/dx = 7cos(7x) + 12sin(4x) + 10sec^2(2x)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 7cos(7(π/4)) + 12sin(4(π/4)) + 10sec^2(2(π/4))\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 7cos(7π/4) + 12sin(π) + 10sec^2(π/2)\n\ncos(7π/4) = √2/2, sin(π) = 0, and sec(π/2) is undefined.\n\nSince sec(π/2) is undefined, the derivative at x = π/4 is also undefined."
