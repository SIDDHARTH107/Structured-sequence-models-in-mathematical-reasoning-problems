    "message_2": "To find the value of x that satisfies the predicate statement \"x + 5 > 10\", we need to solve the inequality:\n\nx + 5 > 10\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\nx > 5\n\nSo, the predicate statement is satisfied when x is greater than 5. There is not a single value of x that satisfies the statement, but rather any value greater than 5 will satisfy it."
