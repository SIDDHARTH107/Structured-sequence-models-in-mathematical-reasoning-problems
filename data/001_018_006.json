    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can first use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation. \n\nlog₂(x+1) - log₂(2x-1) = 3\n\nUsing the quotient rule of logarithms, which states that logb(A) - logb(B) = logb(A/B), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog₂((x+1)/(2x-1)) = 3\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if logb(A) = C, then A = b^C. In this case, b = 2 and C = 3. So, we have:\n\n(x+1)/(2x-1) = 2^3\n\n(x+1)/(2x-1) = 8\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\n8(2x-1) = (x+1)\n\n16x - 8 = x + 1\n\nNow, isolate x by subtracting x from both sides and adding 8 to both sides:\n\n16x - x = 1 + 8\n\n15x = 9\n\nNow, divide by 15 to get the value of x:\n\nx = 9/15\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nx = 3/5\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\nx = 3/5"
