    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) and B, denoted as (A ∆ B) ∩ B.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {4}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of A and (A ∩ B), denoted as A ∆ (B ∩ A).\n\nA ∆ (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3} ∆ {2, 3} = {1}\n\nNow we have (A ∆ B) ∩ B = {4} and A ∆ (B ∩ A) = {1}. To verify whether the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection, we need to check if (A ∆ B) ∩ B = A ∆ (B ∩ A).\n\nSince {4} ≠ {1}, the symmetric difference is not distributive over intersection."
