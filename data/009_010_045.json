    "message_2": "To compute the value of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to calculate the following variables:\n\n1. d1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + σ²/2)T) / (σ√T)\n2. d2 = d1 - σ√T\n3. Call option value (C) = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nWhere:\nS = current stock price = $50\nK = strike price = $60\nT = time to maturity = 0.5 years (6 months)\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.04\nσ = volatility = 0.30\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\nln = natural logarithm\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(50/60) + (0.04 + (0.3²/2)) * 0.5) / (0.3 * √0.5)\nd1 = (ln(0.8333) + (0.04 + 0.045) * 0.5) / (0.3 * 0.7071)\nd1 = (-0.1823 + 0.0425) / 0.2121\nd1 = -0.6587\n\nd2 = d1 - σ√T\nd2 = -0.6587 - (0.3 * 0.7071)\nd2 = -0.6587 - 0.2121\nd2 = -0.8708\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2). Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we get:\n\nN(-0.6587) ≈ 0.2552\nN(-0.8708) ≈ 0.1921\n\nFinally, let's calculate the call option value (C):\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\nC = 50 * 0.2552 - 60 * e^(-0.04 * 0.5) * 0.1921\nC = 12.76 - 60 * 0.9802 * 0.1921\nC = 12.76 - 60 * 0.1881\nC = 12.76 - 11.29\nC ≈ $1.47\n\nSo, the value of the European call option is approximately $1.47."
