    "message_1": "A triangle has an angle of 58 degrees and a side opposite to it with a length of 8 units. Another angle measures 42 degrees, and the triangle's third angle is 80 degrees. Find the length of the other two sides of the triangle.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the other two sides of the triangle, we can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to them as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have:\n\nA = 58 degrees, a = 8 units\nB = 42 degrees\nC = 80 degrees\n\nWe want to find the lengths of sides b and c. Using the Law of Sines, we can set up the following equations:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe already know the values of a, A, B, and C, so we can plug them into the equations:\n\n8/sin(58) = b/sin(42) = c/sin(80)\n\nNow we can solve for b and c:\n\nb = (8/sin(58)) * sin(42)\nb ≈ 5.64 units\n\nc = (8/sin(58)) * sin(80)\nc ≈ 9.47 units\n\nSo, the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle are approximately 5.64 units and 9.47 units."
