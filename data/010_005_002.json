Prove that A ∩ B is path-connected. \n\nAs a numerical example, consider X to be the set of real numbers R, A to be the interval [0,1], and B to be the set of all points x such that 0 < x ≤ 1. Find a path in A ∩ B from the point 0.5 to the point 0.8.",
    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B is path-connected, we need to show that for any two points x, y in A ∩ B, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → A ∩ B such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nSince A is connected and B is path-connected, we know that for any two points x, y in A ∩ B, there exists a continuous function g: [0, 1] → A such that g(0) = x and g(1) = y, and a continuous function h: [0, 1] → B such that h(0) = x and h(1) = y.\n\nNow, consider the function f(t) = g(t) if g(t) ∈ A ∩ B, and h(t) otherwise. Since g(t) and h(t) are continuous functions, f(t) is also continuous. Moreover, f(0) = g(0) = x and f(1) = g(1) = y, as required.\n\nThus, A ∩ B is path-connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the numerical example. We have X = R, A = [0, 1], and B = (0, 1]. The intersection A ∩ B = (0, 1]. We want to find a path in A ∩ B from the point 0.5 to the point 0.8.\n\nWe can define a continuous function f: [0, 1] → (0, 1] as follows:\n\nf(t) = 0.5 + 0.3t\n\nThis function is continuous, and it maps the interval [0, 1] to the interval (0.5, 0.8]. Moreover, f(0) = 0.5 and f(1) = 0.8, as required. Thus, f(t) is a path in A ∩ B from the point 0.5 to the point 0.8."
