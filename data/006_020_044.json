    "message_1": "In a community of 200 people, it is known that 40% of them attend a monthly book club meeting. What is the probability that at least 80 people attend the book club meeting this month?",
    "message_2": "Since 40% of the 200 people attend the monthly book club meeting, on average, there are 0.4 * 200 = 80 people attending the meeting each month. The question asks for the probability that at least 80 people attend the meeting this month.\n\nHowever, to calculate the exact probability, we would need more information about the distribution of the number of attendees (e.g., is it normally distributed, binomially distributed, etc.). Without this information, we cannot provide an exact probability."
