    "message_1": "A school has 400 students, and it is known that 70% of the students get an A in Mathematics. What is the probability that, out of a random sample of 50 students, at least 35 of them will get an A in Mathematics?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, students getting an A in Mathematics) in n trials (in this case, the random sample of 50 students)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.7 or 70%)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 50)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 35)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 35 students getting an A, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 35, 36, ..., 50.\n\nP(X ≥ 35) = P(X = 35) + P(X = 36) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(50, k) * 0.7^k * 0.3^(50-k)\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 35 to 50:\n\nP(X ≥ 35) = Σ [C(50, k) * 0.7^k * 0.3^(50-k)] for k = 35 to 50\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 35) ≈ 0.9599\n\nSo, the probability that at least 35 out of a random sample of 50 students will get an A in Mathematics is approximately 95.99%."
