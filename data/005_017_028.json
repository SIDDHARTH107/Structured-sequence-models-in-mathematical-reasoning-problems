The data is as follows:\n\n| Product Line | Revenue | Marketing Expense |\n|-------------|---------|------------------|\n| 1           | 4       | 2                |\n| 2           | 8       | 4                |\n| 3           | 12      | 6                |\n| 4           | 16      | 8                |\n| 5           | 20      | 10               |\n\nUsing principal component analysis, determine the linear combination of revenue and marketing expense that explains the maximum amount of variation in the data, and calculate the proportion of the total variation in the data that is explained by this linear combination.",
    "message_2": "To perform principal component analysis (PCA), we first need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable. The means and standard deviations for revenue and marketing expense are:\n\nMean_Revenue = (4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20) / 5 = 12\nMean_Marketing_Expense = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 6\n\nStandard_Deviation_Revenue = sqrt(((4-12)^2 + (8-12)^2 + (12-12)^2 + (16-12)^2 + (20-12)^2) / 5) = 5.477\nStandard_Deviation_Marketing_Expense = sqrt(((2-6)^2 + (4-6)^2 + (6-6)^2 + (8-6)^2 + (10-6)^2) / 5) = 2.738\n\nNow, we standardize the data:\n\n| Product Line | Standardized Revenue | Standardized Marketing Expense |\n|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 1           | (4-12)/5.477         | (2-6)/2.738                    |\n| 2           | (8-12)/5.477         | (4-6)/2.738                    |\n| 3           | (12-12)/5.477        | (6-6)/2.738                    |\n| 4           | (16-12)/5.477        | (8-6)/2.738                    |\n| 5           | (20-12)/5.477        | (10-6)/2.738                   |\n\n| Product Line | Standardized Revenue | Standardized Marketing Expense |\n|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 1           | -1.460               | -1.460                         |\n| 2           | -0.730               | -0.730                         |\n| 3           | 0                    | 0                              |\n| 4           | 0.730                | 0.730                          |\n| 5           | 1.460                | 1.460                          |\n\nNext, we compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data:\n\nCov(Standardized_Revenue, Standardized_Marketing_Expense) = (1/4) * Σ(Standardized_Revenue_i * Standardized_Marketing_Expense_i) = (1/4) * (-1.460 * -1.460 + -0.730 * -0.730 + 0 * 0 + 0.730 * 0.730 + 1.460 * 1.460) = 1\n\nThe covariance matrix is:\n\n|       | Standardized Revenue | Standardized Marketing Expense |\n|-------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| SR    | 1                    | 1                              |\n| SME   | 1                    | 1                              |\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. In this case, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 0, and the corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) and v2 = (-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe first principal component is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, which is v1 = (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)). This represents the linear combination of revenue and marketing expense that explains the maximum amount of variation in the data.\n\nTo calculate the proportion of the total variation in the data that is explained by this linear combination, we divide the largest eigenvalue by the sum of all eigenvalues:\n\nProportion_of_Total_Variation = λ1 / (λ1 + λ2) = 2 / (2 + 0) = 1\n\nThus, the first principal component explains 100% of the total variation in the data."
