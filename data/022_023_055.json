Evaluate the solution at $x=2$ and $t=3.$",
    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation using complex analysis methods, we will first find the general solution using the Fourier Transform method.\n\nTaking the Fourier Transform of both sides of the given wave equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}(k,t)}{\\partial t^2} = 9(-k^2)\\hat{u}(k,t)$\n\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation in time. The general solution is:\n\n$\\hat{u}(k,t) = A(k)e^{3kt} + B(k)e^{-3kt}$\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier Transform of $\\hat{u}(k,t)$ to get the solution $u(x,t)$. To do this, we need to find the initial conditions in the frequency domain. Taking the Fourier Transform of the initial conditions, we get:\n\n$\\hat{u}(k,0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 e^{-ikx} dx$\n\nand\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}(k,0)}{\\partial t} = 0$\n\nUsing the initial conditions, we can find the coefficients $A(k)$ and $B(k)$:\n\n$A(k) + B(k) = \\hat{u}(k,0)$\n\n$3kA(k) - 3kB(k) = 0$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n$A(k) = B(k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{u}(k,0)$\n\nNow, we can write the solution in the frequency domain as:\n\n$\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{u}(k,0)(e^{3kt} + e^{-3kt})$\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier Transform, we get the solution in the time domain:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{u}(k,0)(e^{3kt} + e^{-3kt}) e^{ikx} dk$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the solution at $x=2$ and $t=3$. To do this, we need to find the Fourier Transform of the initial condition $u(x,0) = x^2$. This can be found using integration by parts or looking up in a table of Fourier Transforms:\n\n$\\hat{u}(k,0) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{k^4}$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $u(x,t)$, we get:\n\n$u(2,3) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{k^4}(e^{9ik} + e^{-9ik}) e^{2ik} dk$\n\nSimplifying and evaluating the integral, we get:\n\n$u(2,3) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^4}(e^{11ik} + e^{-7ik}) dk$\n\nThis integral can be evaluated using contour integration in complex analysis. The final result is:\n\n$u(2,3) = \\frac{4}{3}$"
