    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have:\n\na = 6, b = 9, and c = 12.\n\nWe want to find the smallest angle, which will be the angle opposite the shortest side. In this case, the shortest side is a, so we want to find angle A.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc * cos(A)\n\nNow, plug in the values for a, b, and c:\n\n6^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 - 2 * 9 * 12 * cos(A)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n36 = 81 + 144 - 216 * cos(A)\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n-189 = -216 * cos(A)\n\nNow, divide both sides by -216:\n\ncos(A) = 189/216\n\nFinally, find the angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nA = arccos(189/216)\n\nA ≈ 25.84°\n\nSo, the measure of the smallest angle (A) is approximately 25.84°."
