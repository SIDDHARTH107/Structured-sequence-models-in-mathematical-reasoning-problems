    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of graph G with 10 vertices and 20 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum number of edges in a graph with 10 vertices without any cycles (i.e., a tree). This can be done using the formula: E = V - 1, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. In this case, E = 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\n2. Since graph G has 20 edges, which is 11 more than the maximum number of edges in a tree with 10 vertices, there must be at least one cycle in the graph.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the shortest cycle in the graph. The shortest possible cycle in any graph is a triangle, which consists of 3 vertices and 3 edges.\n\n4. To check if there is a triangle in graph G, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 20 = 40.\n\n5. If there is a triangle in the graph, there must be at least three vertices with a degree of 2 or more. Since the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 40, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more.\n\n6. Therefore, there is at least one triangle in graph G, and the girth of the graph is 3."
