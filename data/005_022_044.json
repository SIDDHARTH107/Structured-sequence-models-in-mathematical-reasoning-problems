The student decides to use the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) as a robust measure of dispersion to estimate the population standard deviation. The student collects the following data: \n\n10, 12, 12, 14, 10, 20, 14, 10, 50\n\nWhat is the MAD and the estimated population standard deviation?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the median of the dataset. To do this, we'll sort the data in ascending order:\n\n10, 10, 10, 12, 12, 14, 14, 20, 50\n\nThe median is the middle value, which in this case is 12.\n\nNext, we'll find the absolute deviations from the median:\n\n|10 - 12| = 2\n|10 - 12| = 2\n|10 - 12| = 2\n|12 - 12| = 0\n|12 - 12| = 0\n|14 - 12| = 2\n|14 - 12| = 2\n|20 - 12| = 8\n|50 - 12| = 38\n\nNow, we'll find the median of these absolute deviations:\n\n0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 38\n\nThe median of the absolute deviations is 2, so the MAD is 2.\n\nTo estimate the population standard deviation using the MAD, we can use the following formula:\n\nStandard Deviation ≈ 1.4826 * MAD\n\nStandard Deviation ≈ 1.4826 * 2 ≈ 2.9652\n\nSo, the estimated population standard deviation is approximately 2.9652."
