    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 in the interval [0, 3], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - 3\n\nRearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 12)) / 2\nx = (2 ± √(-8)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real roots for this equation. This means that the two curves do not intersect in the interval [0, 3]. \n\nSince the two curves do not intersect, we can find the area between them by subtracting the lower curve from the upper curve and integrating over the interval [0, 3]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 3 - x^2) dx from 0 to 3\n\nNow, we can integrate the function:\n\nArea = [x^2 - (1/3)x^3] from 0 to 3\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nArea = [(3^2 - (1/3)(3^3)) - (0^2 - (1/3)(0^3))]\nArea = [(9 - 9)] - [0]\nArea = 0\n\nThe area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 in the interval [0, 3] is 0."
