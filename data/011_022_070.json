    "message_1": "A student has a knapsack that can hold up to 15 kg of weight. They are given five items weighing 2 kg, 5 kg, 7 kg, 10 kg and 12 kg respectively. The student wants to maximize the value of the items they can carry in the knapsack, where the values of the items are $50, $80, $120, $150, and $200 respectively. What is the maximum total value that the student can carry in their knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total value, we need to find the combination of items that has the highest value without exceeding the 15 kg weight limit.\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations of items:\n\n1. 2 kg + 5 kg + 7 kg = 14 kg, $50 + $80 + $120 = $250\n2. 2 kg + 5 kg + 10 kg = 17 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n3. 2 kg + 5 kg + 12 kg = 19 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n4. 2 kg + 7 kg + 10 kg = 19 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n5. 2 kg + 7 kg + 12 kg = 21 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n6. 5 kg + 7 kg + 10 kg = 22 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n7. 5 kg + 7 kg + 12 kg = 24 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n8. 2 kg + 10 kg + 12 kg = 24 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n\nThe only combination that doesn't exceed the weight limit is the first one, with a total value of $250. Therefore, the maximum total value that the student can carry in their knapsack is $250."
