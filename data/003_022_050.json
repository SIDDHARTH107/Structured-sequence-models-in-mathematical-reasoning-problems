    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n\n|u| = √(2² + 3²) = √(4 + 9) = √13\n|v| = √(4² + (-1)²) = √(16 + 1) = √17\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nwhere u · v is the dot product of u and v, which can be found by multiplying corresponding components and summing the results:\n\nu · v = (2 * 4) + (3 * -1) = 8 - 3 = 5\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = 5 / (√13 * √17)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ) = (√13)(√17)(5 / (√13 * √17)) = 5\n\nSo, the dot product of u and v is 5."
