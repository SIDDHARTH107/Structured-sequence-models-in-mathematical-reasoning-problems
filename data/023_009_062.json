    "message_1": "A metal rod has a length of 5 units and is insulated along its entire length. The ends are maintained at different temperatures: one end at 200°C and the other end at 0°C. Use the Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution along the length of the rod if the thermal conductivity is 0.5 units per second.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the length of the rod, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = k * ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal conductivity (0.5 units per second in this case).\n\nWe are looking for the steady-state temperature distribution, which means that the temperature does not change with time. In this case, the left side of the equation becomes zero:\n\n0 = k * ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nNow we have a second-order ordinary differential equation:\n\n∂²T(x) / ∂x² = 0\n\nIntegrating twice with respect to x, we get:\n\nT(x) = C1 * x + C2\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are constants. We can find these constants using the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = 0°C\nT(5) = 200°C\n\nPlugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n0 = C1 * 0 + C2 => C2 = 0\n200 = C1 * 5 + 0 => C1 = 40\n\nSo the temperature distribution along the length of the rod is:\n\nT(x) = 40 * x\n\nThis linear function describes the temperature distribution along the rod, with the temperature increasing by 40°C per unit length from the 0°C end to the 200°C end."
