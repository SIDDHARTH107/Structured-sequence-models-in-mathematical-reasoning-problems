    "message_2": "The complement of set B with respect to set A, denoted as A\\B or A - B, is the set of all elements in A that are not in B.\n\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7}\nB = {3, 5}\n\nA\\B = {1, 7}\n\nNow, let's prove that the complement is unique. Suppose there exists another set C such that A\\B = C. Then, C must contain all elements in A that are not in B.\n\nSince A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {3, 5}, the elements not in B are {1, 7}. Therefore, C must also contain {1, 7}.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other elements in C. If there were any other elements in C, they would also have to be in A but not in B. However, we have already identified all such elements as {1, 7}. Therefore, there are no other elements in C.\n\nThus, C = {1, 7}, which is the same as A\\B. Since there is no other set that can be the complement of B with respect to A, the complement is unique."
