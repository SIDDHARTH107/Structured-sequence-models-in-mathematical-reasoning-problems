    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We need to find the gradient of f1(x,y) and f2(x,y) and set them equal to the gradient of the constraint function g(x,y) multiplied by a Lagrange multiplier λ.\n\nThe gradient of f1(x,y) is:\n∇f1(x,y) = (2x, 2y)\n\nThe gradient of f2(x,y) is:\n∇f2(x,y) = (2(x-1), 2y)\n\nThe gradient of the constraint function g(x,y) is:\n∇g(x,y) = (1, 1)\n\nNow we set the gradients equal to each other multiplied by the Lagrange multiplier λ:\n\n∇f1(x,y) = λ∇g(x,y)\n(2x, 2y) = λ(1, 1)\n2x = λ\n2y = λ\n\n∇f2(x,y) = λ∇g(x,y)\n(2(x-1), 2y) = λ(1, 1)\n2(x-1) = λ\n2y = λ\n\nNow we have two systems of equations:\n\nSystem 1:\n2x = λ\n2y = λ\nx + y = 2\n\nSystem 2:\n2(x-1) = λ\n2y = λ\nx + y = 2\n\nSolving System 1:\nFrom the first two equations, we have 2x = 2y, which means x = y.\nSubstituting x = y into the constraint equation x + y = 2, we get x = y = 1.\n\nSolving System 2:\nFrom the first two equations, we have 2(x-1) = 2y, which means x - 1 = y.\nSubstituting x - 1 = y into the constraint equation x + y = 2, we get x = 1 and y = 0.\n\nNow we have two potential solutions: (x, y) = (1, 1) and (x, y) = (1, 0).\n\nWe need to check which one minimizes both f1(x,y) and f2(x,y):\n\nf1(1,1) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2\nf2(1,1) = (1-1)^2 + 1^2 = 1\n\nf1(1,0) = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1\nf2(1,0) = (1-1)^2 + 0^2 = 0\n\nThe point (x, y) = (1, 0) minimizes both f1(x,y) and f2(x,y). Therefore, the values of x and y that simultaneously minimize the given equations are x = 1 and y = 0."
