    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = cos(3x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function, say g(h(x)), then the derivative of g with respect to x is the derivative of g with respect to h(x) multiplied by the derivative of h(x) with respect to x. In mathematical notation, this is written as:\n\nd(g(h(x)))/dx = dg(h(x))/dh(x) * dh(x)/dx\n\nIn our case, we have the function f(x) = cos(3x), which can be written as a composite function g(h(x)) with g(u) = cos(u) and h(x) = 3x. \n\nFirst, we find the derivative of g(u) with respect to u:\n\ndg(u)/du = -sin(u)\n\nNext, we find the derivative of h(x) with respect to x:\n\ndh(x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\ndf(x)/dx = dg(h(x))/dh(x) * dh(x)/dx\n\nSubstitute g(u) = cos(u) and h(x) = 3x:\n\ndf(x)/dx = -sin(3x) * 3\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = cos(3x) is:\n\nf'(x) = -3sin(3x)"
