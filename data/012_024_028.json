    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus. The Euler's formula for planar graphs is:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, V = 12 and E = 30. However, we don't know if the graph is planar or not, so we need to consider the possibility that it is embedded on a surface of higher genus (e.g., a torus, double torus, etc.).\n\nFor a graph embedded on a surface of genus g, the generalized Euler's formula is:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find the genus:\n\ng = (2 - V + E - F) / 2\n\nSince we don't know F, we can use the inequality for the number of edges in a planar graph:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n30 ≤ 3 * 12 - 6\n30 ≤ 30\n\nThe inequality holds, so it's possible that the graph is planar (g = 0). However, we can't be sure without more information about the specific graph. If the graph is not planar, we would need to know the number of faces (F) to determine the genus."
