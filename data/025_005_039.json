    "message_2": "To find the tangent line to $V$ at the point $(a, b)$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to $x$ and $y$. Let $F(x, y) = x^2 - y^3$. Then,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = -3y^2$\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $(a, b)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(a, b) = 2a$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(a, b) = -3b^2$\n\nSince $a \\neq 0$, we have $2a \\neq 0$. The tangent line to $V$ at $(a, b)$ is given by the equation\n\n$2a(x - a) - 3b^2(y - b) = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get\n\n$2ax - 3b^2y = 3ab^2 - 2a^2$\n\nThe degree of a line in the plane is always 1, so the degree of the tangent line to $V$ at the point $(a, b)$ is $\\boxed{1}$."
