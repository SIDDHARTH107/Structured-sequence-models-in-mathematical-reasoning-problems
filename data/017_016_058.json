    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 27, we know that |G| = 27 = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which must be normal. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_3 = 3. In this case, there are three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups in G. Let P be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. However, if P were isomorphic to C3 × C3, then the number of elements of order 3 in P would be 6, which contradicts the fact that there are only 9 elements of order 3 in G (since 27 = 3^3, there are 27/3 = 9 elements of order 3 in G). Therefore, P must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nNow, let x be an element of order 9 in P, and let N be the normalizer of P in G. Since P is a Sylow 3-subgroup, we know that |G:N| = n_3 = 3. Thus, |N| = |G|/3 = 9. Since P is a subgroup of N, we have that P is a normal subgroup of N. Let y be an element of order 3 in G such that y is not in N. Then, we can form the semidirect product of P and ⟨y⟩, denoted by P ⋊ ⟨y⟩, which is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27 formed by the semidirect product P ⋊ ⟨y⟩."
