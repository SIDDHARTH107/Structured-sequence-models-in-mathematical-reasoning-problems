    "message_2": "To find the total number of cells in the 5th layer of the Sierpinski sieve, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal cells = Initial cells * (Multiplier)^(Layer - 1)\n\nIn this case, the initial number of cells is 1 (1st layer), the multiplier is 3 (each layer has three times as many cells as the previous layer), and we want to find the total cells in the 5th layer.\n\nTotal cells = 1 * (3)^(5 - 1)\nTotal cells = 1 * (3)^4\nTotal cells = 1 * 81\nTotal cells = 81\n\nSo, the 5th layer of the Sierpinski sieve has 81 cells."
