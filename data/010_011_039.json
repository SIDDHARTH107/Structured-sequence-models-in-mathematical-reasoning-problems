    "message_2": "We will use the following facts:\n\n1. The Euler characteristic of a compact manifold is given by the alternating sum of its Betti numbers: $\\chi(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i b_i$.\n2. The first Betti number $b_1$ is the rank of the abelianization of the fundamental group of the manifold: $b_1 = \\text{rank}(\\pi_1(M)^{\\text{ab}})$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4$. Since this group is already abelian, its abelianization is itself: $\\pi_1(M)^{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4$. The rank of this group is the number of free abelian summands, which is 2 (one for each of the factors $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$). Thus, we have $b_1 = 2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the Euler characteristic formula. Since $\\chi(M) = 3n+2$, we have:\n\n$3n+2 = \\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i b_i$.\n\nWe know that $b_1 = 2$. Since $M$ is a compact manifold, all other odd-indexed Betti numbers must be zero, as the homology groups of a compact manifold are finitely generated. Therefore, we have:\n\n$3n+2 = b_0 - 2 + \\sum_{i=2}^n (-1)^i b_i$.\n\nSince $b_0 = 1$ for a connected manifold (which $M$ must be, since its fundamental group is nontrivial), we get:\n\n$3n+1 = \\sum_{i=2}^n (-1)^i b_i$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic is an alternating sum of Betti numbers. If $n$ is odd, then the sum on the right-hand side of the equation above will be negative, which is a contradiction since $3n+1$ is positive for any positive integer $n$. Therefore, $n$ must be even. Let $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then we have:\n\n$6k+1 = \\sum_{i=2}^{2k} (-1)^i b_i = \\sum_{i=1}^k b_{2i}$.\n\nSince all Betti numbers are nonnegative, the sum on the right-hand side is at least $k$. Thus, we have $6k+1 \\geq k$, which implies $k \\leq \\frac{1}{5}$. Since $k$ is a positive integer, the only possibility is $k = 1$. Therefore, $n = 2k = 2$, and the dimension of the manifold $M$ is 2."
