    "message_2": "Let Z(G) be the center of G. Since Z(G) is nontrivial, there exists an element x in Z(G) such that x ≠ e (identity element). Since x is in the center, it commutes with all elements of G. Let's consider the order of x.\n\nLet |x| = n, where n is a positive integer. Since G has order 16, by Lagrange's theorem, n must divide 16. Thus, n can be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. We know that x ≠ e, so n ≠ 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/Z(G). By the class equation, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G : C_G(y_i)],\n\nwhere y_i are representatives of the non-central conjugacy classes and C_G(y_i) are their centralizers.\n\nSince |G| = 16, |Z(G)| > 1, and each term in the sum is at least 2, we must have |Z(G)| = 2^k for some integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4.\n\nIf |Z(G)| = 16, then G = Z(G), and G is abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C4 × C2 × C2. Since x has order 2, 4, or 8, G cannot be isomorphic to C16. However, this contradicts the assumption that G is non-cyclic. Therefore, |Z(G)| ≠ 16.\n\nNow, let's consider the case |Z(G)| = 8. In this case, the quotient group G/Z(G) has order 2, which implies that G/Z(G) is cyclic. By a theorem in group theory, if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is abelian. Again, G would be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C4 × C2 × C2. Since x has order 2, 4, or 8, G cannot be isomorphic to C16. However, this contradicts the assumption that G is non-cyclic. Therefore, |Z(G)| ≠ 8.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is |Z(G)| = 4. In this case, the quotient group G/Z(G) has order 4. Since G/Z(G) is a group of order 4, it is either isomorphic to C4 or C2 × C2. \n\nIf G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C4, then G has a normal subgroup of order 4. Let H be a normal subgroup of G with order 4. Since G is non-cyclic, H cannot be equal to G. Then, G has a normal subgroup H of order 4 and a central element x of order 2, 4, or 8. Since x is in the center, it commutes with all elements of H. Thus, we can form a subgroup K = ⟨x, H⟩. Since x and H commute, |K| = |x||H| = n*4, where n is the order of x. Since n is either 2, 4, or 8, |K| is either 8, 16, or 32. However, |K| must divide |G| = 16, so |K| cannot be 32. If |K| = 8, then G has a subgroup of order 8, which implies that G is not simple. If |K| = 16, then K = G, and G is generated by x and H, which implies that G is cyclic, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, G/Z(G) must be isomorphic to C2 × C2. Let a and b be elements of G such that their images in G/Z(G) generate the two cyclic factors of C2 × C2. Then, the order of a and b in G must be 2. Since G/Z(G) is generated by the images of a and b, G is generated by a, b, and Z(G). Since a and b have order 2, they are in Z(G). Thus, G is generated by Z(G), which implies that G is abelian. However, this contradicts the assumption that G is non-cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the cases for |Z(G)| are possible, which implies that our assumption that G is non-cyclic must be false. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C16."
