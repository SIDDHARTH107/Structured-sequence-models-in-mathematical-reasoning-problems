    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of equations, we can use the method of Gaussian elimination. First, we can write the system in matrix form:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0]\n[ 2 -1  1 | 0]\n[-3  4 -2 | 0]\n```\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 2:\n```\n[ 2 -1  1 | 0]\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0]\n[-3  4 -2 | 0]\n```\n\n2. Replace row 2 with (-1/2) * row 1 + row 2:\n```\n[  2  -1   1 |  0]\n[  0   3/2 -3/2 |  0]\n[ -3   4  -2  |  0]\n```\n\n3. Replace row 3 with (3/2) * row 1 + row 3:\n```\n[  2  -1   1  |  0]\n[  0  3/2 -3/2 |  0]\n[  0   1/2 -1/2 |  0]\n```\n\n4. Replace row 3 with (-1/3) * row 2 + row 3:\n```\n[ 2 -1  1 |  0]\n[ 0 3/2 -3/2 |  0]\n[ 0  0   0  |  0]\n```\n\nNow, we have the following equivalent system of equations:\n\n```\n2x - y + z = 0\n3/2y - 3/2z = 0\n```\n\nDivide the second equation by 3/2:\n\n```\ny - z = 0\n```\n\nNow, we can express the variables in terms of a free variable:\n\n```\nz = t (t is a free variable)\ny = z = t\nx = y - z = t - t = 0\n```\n\nSo, the general solution to the homogeneous system of equations is:\n\n```\nx = 0\ny = t\nz = t\n```\n\nwhere t is any real number."
