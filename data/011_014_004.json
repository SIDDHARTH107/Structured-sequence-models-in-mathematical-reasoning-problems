    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in the graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, each of the 7 vertices has a degree of 3. So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 7 * 3 = 21.\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Lemma, the number of edges is half of this sum:\n\nNumber of edges = 21 / 2 = 10.5\n\nHowever, the number of edges must be an integer. This means that a graph with 7 vertices, each with a degree of 3, cannot exist."
