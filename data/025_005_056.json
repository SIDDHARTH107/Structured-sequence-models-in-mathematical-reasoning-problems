    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety X, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the given polynomial system f(x, y, z) and find the points where all the partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet f1(x, y, z) = x^3 - y^2 - z^2 and f2(x, y, z) = x^2 - y^3 - z^2.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 3x^2, ∂f1/∂y = -2y, ∂f1/∂z = -2z\n∂f2/∂x = 2x, ∂f2/∂y = -3y^2, ∂f2/∂z = -2z\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y, z) where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n3x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n-2y = 0 => y = 0\n-2z = 0 => z = 0\n\nHowever, in the projective space P^2(C), the point (0, 0, 0) does not exist. Therefore, we need to consider the homogeneous coordinates [X:Y:Z] and homogenize the given polynomials:\n\nF1(X, Y, Z) = X^3 - Y^2Z - Z^3 and F2(X, Y, Z) = X^2Z - Y^3 - Z^3.\n\nNow, compute the partial derivatives with respect to X, Y, and Z:\n\n∂F1/∂X = 3X^2, ∂F1/∂Y = -2YZ, ∂F1/∂Z = -Y^2 - 3Z^2\n∂F2/∂X = 2XZ, ∂F2/∂Y = -3Y^2, ∂F2/∂Z = X^2 - 3Z^2\n\nWe need to find the points [X:Y:Z] where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n3X^2 = 0 => X = 0\n-2YZ = 0 => Y = 0 or Z = 0\n-Y^2 - 3Z^2 = 0 => Y^2 = -3Z^2\n2XZ = 0 => X = 0 or Z = 0\n-3Y^2 = 0 => Y = 0\nX^2 - 3Z^2 = 0 => X^2 = 3Z^2\n\nFrom the above equations, we can see that there are two cases:\n\n1) X = 0, Y = 0, Z ≠ 0: In this case, the point is [0:0:1], which is a singular point of X.\n\n2) X ≠ 0, Y = 0, Z ≠ 0: In this case, X^2 = 3Z^2. We can write this as X^2 - 3Z^2 = 0, which is the equation of a conic in P^2(C). This conic intersects the curve X at the points where Y = 0. However, these points are not singular points of X.\n\nThus, the only singular point of the algebraic variety X in the complex projective space P^2(C) is [0:0:1]."
