    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct Ferrers diagrams with six squares that are three-by-three or smaller, we need to consider all the possible arrangements of six squares within a 3x3 grid while maintaining the non-increasing row condition.\n\nHere are the possible arrangements:\n\n1. Three rows with 3, 2, and 1 squares respectively:\n```\n***\n**\n*\n```\n\n2. Two rows with 4 and 2 squares respectively:\n```\n****\n**\n```\n\n3. Two rows with 3 and 3 squares respectively:\n```\n***\n***\n```\n\n4. One row with 6 squares (not possible since it exceeds the 3x3 grid constraint)\n\nSo, there are 3 distinct Ferrers diagrams with six squares that are three-by-three or smaller."
