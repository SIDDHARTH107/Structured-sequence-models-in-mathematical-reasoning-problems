    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from an initial larger square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed. \n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 8 squares.\nAfter the second iteration, each of the 8 squares is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the central square is removed, leaving 8 * (9 - 1) = 8 * 8 = 64 squares.\nAfter the third iteration, the same process is applied to each of the 64 squares, resulting in 64 * 8 = 512 squares.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the same process is applied to each of the 512 squares, resulting in 512 * 8 = 4096 squares.\n\nSo, after 4 iterations, there are a total of 4096 squares in the Sierpinski carpet."
