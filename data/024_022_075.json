    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distances between points on the surface M. To find all isometries of (M, g), we need to consider transformations that preserve the metric g.\n\nFirst, let's write down the metric g in local coordinates (u, v) on M. We can parametrize M by the map:\n\nΦ(u, v) = (u*cos(v), u*sin(v), u^2),\n\nwhere u ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ v < 2π. The tangent vectors to M are given by:\n\nΦ_u = (∂Φ/∂u) = (cos(v), sin(v), 2u),\nΦ_v = (∂Φ/∂v) = (-u*sin(v), u*cos(v), 0).\n\nNow, we can compute the metric g:\n\ng = (Φ_u, Φ_u) du^2 + 2(Φ_u, Φ_v) du dv + (Φ_v, Φ_v) dv^2,\n\nwhere (.,.) denotes the standard Euclidean inner product in R^3. We have:\n\n(Φ_u, Φ_u) = cos^2(v) + sin^2(v) + 4u^2 = 1 + 4u^2,\n(Φ_u, Φ_v) = -u*cos(v)*sin(v) + u*sin(v)*cos(v) = 0,\n(Φ_v, Φ_v) = u^2*sin^2(v) + u^2*cos^2(v) = u^2.\n\nThus, the metric g is given by:\n\ng = (1 + 4u^2) du^2 + u^2 dv^2.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible isometries. There are three types of isometries in R^3: translations, rotations, and reflections. However, since M is not a plane, translations cannot be isometries of M. So, we only need to consider rotations and reflections.\n\n1. Rotations: Rotations around the z-axis will preserve the metric g since they preserve the Euclidean metric in R^3 and the surface M is symmetric with respect to the z-axis. These rotations can be parametrized by an angle θ, and the transformation is given by:\n\n(x, y, z) ↦ (x*cos(θ) - y*sin(θ), x*sin(θ) + y*cos(θ), z).\n\n2. Reflections: The only reflection that preserves the metric g is the one with respect to the plane x = 0 (or equivalently, v = π/2). This reflection can be described by the transformation:\n\n(x, y, z) ↦ (-x, y, z).\n\nIn conclusion, the isometries of (M, g) are rotations around the z-axis and reflection with respect to the plane x = 0."
