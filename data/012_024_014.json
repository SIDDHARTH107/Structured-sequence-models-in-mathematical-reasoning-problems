    "message_2": "A complete graph with 7 vertices is denoted as K_7. To determine the genus of K_7, we can use the formula for the genus of a graph:\n\ng = (e - n + 1)/2\n\nwhere g is the genus, e is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices.\n\nFor a complete graph, the number of edges e can be calculated using the formula:\n\ne = n(n - 1)/2\n\nFor K_7, we have n = 7, so the number of edges e is:\n\ne = 7(7 - 1)/2 = 7(6)/2 = 21\n\nNow, we can plug the values of e and n into the formula for the genus:\n\ng = (21 - 7 + 1)/2 = (14)/2 = 7\n\nSo, the genus of a complete graph with 7 vertices (K_7) is 7."
