    "message_1": "Suppose a school's math test scores follow a normal distribution with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 10. If a random sample of 25 students is taken from this school, what is the probability that the mean test score of the sample is less than 70?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, μ = 75, σ = 10, and n = 25.\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (also called the standard error) is:\n\nStandard Error (SE) = σ / √n = 10 / √25 = 10 / 5 = 2\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 70. To do this, we will calculate the z-score for a sample mean of 70:\n\nz = (X̄ - μ) / SE = (70 - 75) / 2 = -5 / 2 = -2.5\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table (also called the z-table) to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.5. Looking up -2.5 in the z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.0062.\n\nSo, the probability that the mean test score of the sample is less than 70 is approximately 0.0062, or 0.62%."
