    "message_1": "A hiker is standing on the ground and looks up at the top of a tall cliff. The angle of elevation from the hiker's eye to the top of the cliff is 42 degrees. If the hiker is standing 200 meters away from the base of the cliff, how tall is the cliff to the nearest meter? (Assume the ground is level.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 42 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the cliff (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the hiker to the base of the cliff, which is 200 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(42°) = (height of cliff) / 200\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the cliff:\n\nheight of cliff = tan(42°) * 200\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nheight of cliff ≈ 1.9003 * 200\nheight of cliff ≈ 380.06\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the cliff is approximately 380 meters."
