    "message_2": "Let's find a conformal map that transforms the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ onto a vertical slit domain from $-1$ to $1$ that excludes the point $0$. We can construct this map in several steps.\n\n1. First, we map the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ to the right half-plane. We can use the MÃ¶bius transformation $f_1(z) = \\frac{z+1}{1-z}$ for this purpose. Note that $f_1(0) = 1$ and $f_1(-1) = \\infty$.\n\n2. Next, we map the right half-plane to the upper half-plane. We can use the transformation $f_2(z) = z^2$ for this purpose. Note that $f_2(1) = 1$ and $f_2(\\infty) = \\infty$.\n\n3. Finally, we map the upper half-plane to the vertical slit domain from $-1$ to $1$ that excludes the point $0$. We can use the transformation $f_3(z) = z + \\frac{1}{z}$ for this purpose. Note that $f_3(1) = 2$ and $f_3(\\infty) = \\infty$.\n\nNow, we can find the composition of these transformations to get the desired conformal map:\n\n$$f(z) = f_3(f_2(f_1(z))) = f_3(f_2(\\frac{z+1}{1-z})) = f_3((\\frac{z+1}{1-z})^2) = (\\frac{z+1}{1-z})^2 + \\frac{1}{(\\frac{z+1}{1-z})^2}.$$\n\nTo find the image of the point $i$ under this map, we can plug $z=i$ into the formula for $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(i) = (\\frac{i+1}{1-i})^2 + \\frac{1}{(\\frac{i+1}{1-i})^2} = (\\frac{1+i}{1-i})^2 + \\frac{1}{(\\frac{1+i}{1-i})^2}.$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n$$f(i) = (\\frac{(1+i)(1+i)}{(1-i)(1+i)})^2 + \\frac{1}{(\\frac{(1+i)(1+i)}{(1-i)(1+i)})^2} = (\\frac{2i}{2})^2 + \\frac{1}{(\\frac{2i}{2})^2} = (i)^2 + \\frac{1}{(i)^2}.$$\n\nNow, we can compute the powers of $i$:\n\n$$f(i) = (-1) + \\frac{1}{(-1)} = -1 - 1 = -2.$$\n\nSo, the image of the point $i$ under the conformal map $f(z)$ is $-2$."
