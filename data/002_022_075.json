    "message_1": "A torus has a minor radius of 3 cm and a major radius of 8 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 8 cm and r = 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 8 * 3^3\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 8 * 27\n\nVolume = 2 * (9.8696) * 216\n\nVolume = 4252.5 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 4252.5 cubic centimeters."
