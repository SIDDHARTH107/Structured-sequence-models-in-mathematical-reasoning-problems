    "message_1": "The following is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic Epidemiology models for disease spread in Differential Equations:\n\nThe spread of a disease in a population can be modeled by the differential equation dS/dt = -0.005S - 0.001IS, where S(t) is the number of susceptible people, I(t) is the number of infected people, and t is time in days. Suppose that initially there are 20000 susceptible people and 50 infected people. Find the number of susceptible people and the number of infected people after 10 days assuming that 5% of susceptible people per day and 20% of infected people per day are becoming immune to the disease.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider two differential equations: one for the number of susceptible people (S) and one for the number of infected people (I). We are given the differential equation for susceptible people:\n\ndS/dt = -0.005S - 0.001IS\n\nWe also know that 5% of susceptible people per day and 20% of infected people per day are becoming immune. This means that the number of infected people is decreasing at a rate proportional to the number of infected people and the number of susceptible people becoming immune. We can write this as:\n\ndI/dt = 0.005S - 0.02I\n\nNow, we have a system of two differential equations:\n\ndS/dt = -0.005S - 0.001IS\ndI/dt = 0.005S - 0.02I\n\nWith initial conditions:\n\nS(0) = 20000\nI(0) = 50\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use numerical methods such as Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method. For simplicity, we will use Euler's method with a step size of 1 day.\n\nWe will iterate the following equations for 10 days:\n\nS(t+1) = S(t) + (-0.005S(t) - 0.001I(t)S(t)) * Δt\nI(t+1) = I(t) + (0.005S(t) - 0.02I(t)) * Δt\n\nwhere Δt = 1 day.\n\nIterating these equations for 10 days:\n\nDay 1:\nS(1) = 20000 + (-0.005*20000 - 0.001*50*20000) * 1 = 19000\nI(1) = 50 + (0.005*20000 - 0.02*50) * 1 = 150\n\nDay 2:\nS(2) = 19000 + (-0.005*19000 - 0.001*150*19000) * 1 = 18050\nI(2) = 150 + (0.005*19000 - 0.02*150) * 1 = 245\n\nDay 3:\nS(3) = 18050 + (-0.005*18050 - 0.001*245*18050) * 1 = 17159\nI(3) = 245 + (0.005*18050 - 0.02*245) * 1 = 334\n\nDay 4:\nS(4) = 17159 + (-0.005*17159 - 0.001*334*17159) * 1 = 16325\nI(4) = 334 + (0.005*17159 - 0.02*334) * 1 = 417\n\nDay 5:\nS(5) = 16325 + (-0.005*16325 - 0.001*417*16325) * 1 = 15547\nI(5) = 417 + (0.005*16325 - 0.02*417) * 1 = 493\n\nDay 6:\nS(6) = 15547 + (-0.005*15547 - 0.001*493*15547) * 1 = 14823\nI(6) = 493 + (0.005*15547 - 0.02*493) * 1 = 562\n\nDay 7:\nS(7) = 14823 + (-0.005*14823 - 0.001*562*14823) * 1 = 14152\nI(7) = 562 + (0.005*14823 - 0.02*562) * 1 = 624\n\nDay 8:\nS(8) = 14152 + (-0.005*14152 - 0.001*624*14152) * 1 = 13531\nI(8) = 624 + (0.005*14152 - 0.02*624) * 1 = 679\n\nDay 9:\nS(9) = 13531 + (-0.005*13531 - 0.001*679*13531) * 1 = 12958\nI(9) = 679 + (0.005*13531 - 0.02*679) * 1 = 728\n\nDay 10:\nS(10) = 12958 + (-0.005*12958 - 0.001*728*12958) * 1 = 12431\nI(10) = 728 + (0.005*12958 - 0.02*728) * 1 = 770\n\nAfter 10 days, there are approximately 12,431 susceptible people and 770 infected people."
