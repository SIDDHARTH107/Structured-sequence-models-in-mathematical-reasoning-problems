    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4, we first need to find the second derivative of the function and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (6x^2 - 18x + 12)\nf''(x) = 12x - 18\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n12x - 18 = 0\n12x = 18\nx = 18/12\nx = 3/2\n\nSo, there is one inflection point at x = 3/2. To find the corresponding y-value, we plug this value back into the original function:\n\nf(3/2) = 2(3/2)^3 - 9(3/2)^2 + 12(3/2) - 4\nf(3/2) = 2(27/8) - 9(9/4) + 18 - 4\nf(3/2) = 27/4 - 81/4 + 14\nf(3/2) = -54/4 + 14\nf(3/2) = -27/2 + 14\nf(3/2) = -1/2\n\nThus, the inflection point is at (3/2, -1/2)."
