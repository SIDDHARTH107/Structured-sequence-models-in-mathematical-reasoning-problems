    "message_2": "To partition the number 6 into distinct positive integers, we need to find the unique combinations of numbers that add up to 6. The distinct positive integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We can partition 6 in the following ways:\n\n1. 1 + 2 + 3\n2. 1 + 5\n3. 2 + 4\n4. 6\n\nThere are 4 ways to partition the number 6 into distinct positive integers."
