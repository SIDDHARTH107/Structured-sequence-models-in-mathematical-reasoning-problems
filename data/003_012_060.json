    "message_1": "A person standing at the bottom of a 50-feet tall building looks up at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees to the top of the building. What is the distance from the person to the base of the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have a right triangle with the building as the height (opposite side), the distance from the person to the base of the building as the base (adjacent side), and the angle of elevation (60 degrees) between them.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to solve for the distance from the person to the base of the building:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees, and the opposite side (height of the building) is 50 feet:\n\ntan(60) = 50 / adjacent\n\nFirst, we need to find the tangent of 60 degrees. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the ratio of the side opposite the 60-degree angle (the longer leg) to the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (the shorter leg). In this case, the ratio is √3:1, so tan(60) = √3.\n\nNow we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\n√3 = 50 / adjacent\n\nTo solve for the adjacent side (the distance from the person to the base of the building), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the adjacent side and then divide both sides by √3:\n\nadjacent * √3 = 50\nadjacent = 50 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\nadjacent = (50 * √3) / (√3 * √3)\nadjacent = 50√3 / 3\n\nSo the distance from the person to the base of the building is approximately 50√3 / 3 feet, which is approximately 28.87 feet."
