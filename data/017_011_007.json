    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 12 is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_3 divides 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1\n2. n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 3\n3. n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 1\n\nWe will analyze each case and show the corresponding isomorphisms.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1\n\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. Let P_3 and P_2 be these subgroups, respectively. Since they are unique, they are both normal in G. We have |P_3| = 3 and |P_2| = 4. Since P_3 ∩ P_2 = {e}, the group G is isomorphic to the direct product P_3 × P_2, which is a cyclic group of order 12. Thus, G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nIsomorphism: φ: G → C12, where φ(g) = g for all g in G.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 3\n\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, which is normal in G. However, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since |P_3| = 3 and |P_2| = 4, we have P_3 ∩ P_2 = {e}. The group G acts on the set of left cosets of P_2 by left multiplication, and this action induces a homomorphism ψ: G → S_3.\n\nThe kernel of ψ is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in P_2. Since P_3 is normal in G, the kernel must be trivial, i.e., {e}. Thus, ψ is injective, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_3. The only subgroup of S_3 with 12 elements is A4, so G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nIsomorphism: ψ: G → A4, where ψ(g) is the permutation induced by the action of g on the left cosets of P_2.\n\nCase 3: n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 1\n\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, which is normal in G. However, there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since |P_3| = 3 and |P_2| = 4, we have P_3 ∩ P_2 = {e}. The group G acts on the set of left cosets of P_3 by left multiplication, and this action induces a homomorphism ψ: G → S_4.\n\nThe kernel of ψ is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in P_3. Since P_2 is normal in G, the kernel must be trivial, i.e., {e}. Thus, ψ is injective, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_4. The only subgroup of S_4 with 12 elements is D6, so G is isomorphic to D6.\n\nIsomorphism: ψ: G → D6, where ψ(g) is the permutation induced by the action of g on the left cosets of P_3.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 12 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
