    "message_2": "A block cipher with a key size of 64 bits means there are 2^64 possible keys. Since no two keys generate the same cipher text, each key will generate a unique cipher text for a given plaintext.\n\nThe block size of 128 bits means there are 2^128 possible plaintext blocks that can be encrypted.\n\nHowever, the number of possible cipher texts is limited by the number of keys, as each key generates a unique cipher text for a given plaintext. Therefore, the number of possible cipher texts generated by this block cipher is equal to the number of possible keys, which is 2^64."
