    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of this graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph with the smallest possible maximum bag size minus one.\n\nOne possible tree decomposition is:\n\n```\n  T1\n / \\\nT2 T3\n```\n\nWhere:\n- T1 = {1, 2, 3}\n- T2 = {2, 4, 5}\n- T3 = {3, 5, 6}\n\nEach bag has 3 vertices, and every edge in the original graph is covered by at least one bag. Also, the intersection of any two bags is a subtree in the decomposition.\n\nThe maximum bag size is 3, so the treewidth of this graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
