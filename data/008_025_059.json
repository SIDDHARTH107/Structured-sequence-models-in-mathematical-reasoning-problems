    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n9x + 12y = 8\n3x + 4y = 8/3\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n3x + 4y = 6\n3x + 4y = 8/3\n\nNotice that both equations have the same left side (3x + 4y) but different right sides (6 and 8/3). This means that the system of equations is inconsistent and has no solution."
