    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1m is heated on one end and cooled on the other end. The temperature at the heated end is 100°C and at the cooled end is 0°C. The temperature distribution of the rod can be modeled by the equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + k^2 T = 0$\n\nwhere T(x) is the temperature distribution at position x along the rod and k is a constant.\n\nUse the Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution T(x) along the rod. Given k = 2π.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the general solution of the equation. The given equation is:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + k^2 T = 0$\n\nwhere k = 2π.\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution can be written as:\n\n$T(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\nNow we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) At x = 0, T(0) = 100°C:\n\n$100 = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0)$\n\nSince $\\cos(0) = 1$ and $\\sin(0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$100 = A$\n\n2) At x = 1, T(1) = 0°C:\n\n$0 = 100\\cos(2\\pi) + B\\sin(2\\pi)$\n\nSince $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$ and $\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$, we get:\n\n$0 = 100 + 0$\n\nThis implies that the given boundary conditions cannot be satisfied by the general solution of the given differential equation. This is because the problem is not well-posed for the given equation and boundary conditions. In order to find the temperature distribution T(x) along the rod, we need to consider a different mathematical model, such as the heat equation, which takes into account the time-dependent heat conduction process."
