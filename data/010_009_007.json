If we further subdivide each triangle into four congruent smaller triangles by adding diagonals, what is the total number of triangles in the mesh?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the number of smaller equilateral triangles formed by dividing each side of the original triangle into n equal segments. This can be done using the triangular number formula:\n\nT(n) = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, the total number of smaller equilateral triangles formed is:\n\nT(n) = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\nNow, we further subdivide each of these smaller equilateral triangles into four congruent smaller triangles by adding diagonals. So, the total number of triangles in the mesh after this subdivision is:\n\nTotal triangles = 4 * T(n) = 4 * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = 2 * n * (n + 1)\n\nSo, the total number of triangles in the mesh is 2 * n * (n + 1)."
