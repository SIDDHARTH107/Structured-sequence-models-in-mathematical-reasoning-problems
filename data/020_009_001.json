    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company has a production line that can operate for 8 hours a day. The production line can produce two types of products: type A and type B. The production time required for one unit of type A is 1 hour, while the production time required for one unit of type B is 2 hours. The company has a daily demand of 50 units of type A and 40 units of type B. The profit earned per unit of type A is $10, while the profit earned per unit of type B is $15. The company wants to maximize its daily profit.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of type A and type B that the company should produce each day to maximize its daily profit, given that each day the production line can operate for only 8 hours?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A produced and y be the number of units of type B produced.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. The production time constraint: 1x + 2y ≤ 8 (since type A takes 1 hour to produce and type B takes 2 hours)\n2. The demand constraint: x ≤ 50 and y ≤ 40\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the feasible region and finding the vertices.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region:\n\n1. 1x + 2y ≤ 8\n   y ≤ (8 - x) / 2\n\n2. x ≤ 50\n3. y ≤ 40\n\nNow, we plot the feasible region and find the vertices:\n\n1. (0, 0) - Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0\n2. (0, 4) - Intersection of x = 0 and y = (8 - x) / 2\n3. (8, 0) - Intersection of y = 0 and x = 8 (from 1x + 2y = 8)\n4. (50, 0) - Intersection of x = 50 and y = 0\n5. (0, 40) - Intersection of x = 0 and y = 40\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 4) = 10(0) + 15(4) = $60\n3. P(8, 0) = 10(8) + 15(0) = $80\n4. P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 15(0) = $500\n5. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 15(40) = $600\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at vertex (0, 40), which corresponds to producing 0 units of type A and 40 units of type B. The maximum daily profit is $600."
