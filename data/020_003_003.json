    "message_1": "A factory produces 1000 units of a product per day. The production cost per unit is a quadratic function given by C(x) = 0.02x^2 + 20x + 200, where x is the number of units produced. The factory wants to minimize its total production cost. What is the number of units it should produce per day to achieve this minimum?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total production cost, we need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function C(x) = 0.02x^2 + 20x + 200. To do this, we can find the vertex of the parabola represented by this function. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic function C(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. In this case, a = 0.02 and b = 20.\n\nx = -20 / (2 * 0.02)\nx = -20 / 0.04\nx = 500\n\nSo, the factory should produce 500 units per day to minimize its total production cost."
