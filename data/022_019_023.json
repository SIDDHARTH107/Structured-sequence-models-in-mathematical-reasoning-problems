    "message_2": "To find the value of the integral of f(z) over the circle |z| = 2 in the complex plane, we will use the Cauchy integral formula. First, we rewrite f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 1)/z = z - 1/z\n\nNow, we parameterize the circle |z| = 2 using z(t) = 2e^(it), where t is a real parameter and 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Then, we find the derivative of z(t) with respect to t:\n\ndz/dt = 2ie^(it)\n\nNext, we substitute z(t) into f(z):\n\nf(z(t)) = 2e^(it) - 1/(2e^(it))\n\nNow, we compute the integral of f(z) over the circle |z| = 2:\n\n∫(f(z(t))dz/dt)dt from 0 to 2π\n\n= ∫((2e^(it) - 1/(2e^(it))) * (2ie^(it)))dt from 0 to 2π\n\n= ∫(4i(e^(2it) - 1/2))dt from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we integrate with respect to t:\n\n= 4i∫(e^(2it) - 1/2)dt from 0 to 2π\n\n= 4i[(1/2)e^(2it) - 1/2t] from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n= 4i[((1/2)e^(4iπ) - 1/2(2π)) - ((1/2)e^(0) - 1/2(0))]\n\nSince e^(4iπ) = 1:\n\n= 4i[((1/2)(1) - π) - ((1/2)(1) - 0)]\n\n= 4i(-π)\n\nThus, the value of the integral of f(z) over the circle |z| = 2 in the complex plane is -4iπ."
