    "message_1": "A ship leaves port and must arrive at its destination 12 hours later, traveling a distance of 500 miles. The ship's engine moves it at a rate of 25 miles per hour in still water. However, the ship is traveling against the current, which has a speed of 5 miles per hour. What direction should the ship take to arrive at its destination in the least time possible?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the time it takes for the ship to reach its destination, it should travel in a straight line against the current. In this case, the effective speed of the ship will be the difference between its speed in still water and the speed of the current.\n\nEffective speed = Speed in still water - Speed of the current\nEffective speed = 25 mph - 5 mph = 20 mph\n\nNow, we can calculate the time it will take for the ship to travel 500 miles at this effective speed.\n\nTime = Distance / Effective speed\nTime = 500 miles / 20 mph = 25 hours\n\nHowever, the ship must arrive at its destination in 12 hours. Since the minimum time calculated is 25 hours, which is greater than the required 12 hours, it is not possible for the ship to reach its destination in the least time possible following a straight line against the current."
