The size of a vertex cover is the number of vertices in the subset.)",
    "message_2": "To find the smallest possible size of a vertex cover for this graph, we need to find a subset of vertices that covers all the edges. We can start by selecting the vertices with the highest degree (i.e., the most edges connected to them).\n\nVertices 1 and 6 have the highest degree, with 4 edges each. By selecting these two vertices, we cover the edges (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (4, 6), and (3, 6). Now we only need to cover the edges (2, 5) and (5, 7). We can do this by selecting vertex 5.\n\nSo, the smallest possible size of a vertex cover for this graph is 3, with the vertex cover being {1, 5, 6}."
