    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find all possible group orders that divide 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Using the formula for the number of divisors, we have (3 + 1)(2 + 1) = 12 divisors, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 72. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. So, we can write the abelian groups of order 72 as:\n\n1. Z_72\n2. Z_36 x Z_2\n3. Z_24 x Z_3\n4. Z_18 x Z_4\n5. Z_12 x Z_6\n6. Z_9 x Z_8\n7. Z_9 x Z_4 x Z_2\n8. Z_6 x Z_4 x Z_3\n9. Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_8\n10. Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_4 x Z_2\n\nThere are 10 abelian groups of order 72. Now, we can use the formula for the number of groups of order n:\n\nnumber of groups = (number of divisors of n) - (number of abelian groups of order n)\n\nIn our case, this is:\n\nnumber of non-abelian groups = 12 - 10 = 2\n\nThere are 2 non-abelian groups of order 72. Listing them is not straightforward, as their structure depends on the specific group presentation. However, we can describe them in terms of their semi-direct products:\n\n1. (Z_9 x Z_4) ⋊ Z_2\n2. (Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_4) ⋊ Z_2\n\nThese are the two non-abelian groups of order 72."
