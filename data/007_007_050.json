    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 17x + 31y = 1, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm not only finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b, but also the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers x and y such that:\n\nax + by = gcd(a, b)\n\nIn this case, since gcd(17, 31) = 1, we can find x and y such that:\n\n17x + 31y = 1\n\nApplying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (31) by the smaller number (17):\n   31 = 17 * 1 + 14\n\n2. Divide the previous divisor (17) by the remainder (14):\n   17 = 14 * 1 + 3\n\n3. Divide the previous divisor (14) by the remainder (3):\n   14 = 3 * 4 + 2\n\n4. Divide the previous divisor (3) by the remainder (2):\n   3 = 2 * 1 + 1\n\nNow, we can work our way back up to find the values of x and y:\n\n1 = 3 - 2 * 1\n  = 3 - (14 - 3 * 4) * 1\n  = 3 - 14 + 3 * 4\n  = -1 * 14 + 3 * 17\n\nSo, x = 3 and y = -1 is a solution to the Diophantine equation 17x + 31y = 1.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there are infinitely many solutions to this equation, as we can add or subtract multiples of the other coefficient to each variable:\n\nx = 3 + 31k\ny = -1 - 17k\n\nwhere k is any integer."
