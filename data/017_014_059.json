    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 4 (the index of 5 in the factorization) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 5 (the index of 2 in the factorization) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. There are two possibilities: either there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, or there are five Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\n1. If there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal. In this case, we have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, so the group is a direct product of these two subgroups. Since there are two isomorphism classes of groups of order 4 (C4 and C2xC2), there are two possible isomorphism classes in this case: C4xC5 and C2xC2xC5.\n\n2. If there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, none of them are normal. In this case, we can use the semidirect product to construct the group. There are two possible actions of the Sylow 5-subgroup on the Sylow 2-subgroup (trivial and nontrivial). The trivial action gives us the direct product C4xC5, which we already counted in the first case. The nontrivial action gives us a new isomorphism class, which is the dihedral group D20.\n\nSo, in total, there are three distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20: C4xC5, C2xC2xC5, and D20."
