    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{72}$, we need to find the prime factorization of 72 and then simplify the square root by pairing up factors.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is:\n$72 = 2^3 \\times 3^2$\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root by pairing up factors:\n$\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{2^3 \\times 3^2} = \\sqrt{(2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times 2} = \\sqrt{2^2} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is $6\\sqrt{2}$."
