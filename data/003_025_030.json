    "message_2": "To find the ship's velocity relative to the ground, we need to add the ship's velocity vector to the ocean's current vector. Let's represent the ship's velocity vector as V_ship and the ocean's current vector as V_current.\n\nThe ship's velocity vector can be broken down into its Eastward (x-axis) and Northward (y-axis) components:\n\nV_ship_x = 20 * cos(35°)\nV_ship_y = 20 * sin(35°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nV_ship_x ≈ 16.38 knots (Eastward)\nV_ship_y ≈ 11.49 knots (Northward)\n\nNow, let's represent the ocean's current vector:\n\nV_current_x = 0 knots (since it's flowing due South, there's no Eastward or Westward component)\nV_current_y = -5 knots (Southward, hence the negative sign)\n\nNow, we can find the ship's velocity relative to the ground by adding the two vectors:\n\nV_relative_x = V_ship_x + V_current_x\nV_relative_y = V_ship_y + V_current_y\n\nV_relative_x = 16.38 + 0 = 16.38 knots (Eastward)\nV_relative_y = 11.49 + (-5) = 6.49 knots (Northward)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude and direction of the ship's velocity relative to the ground. The magnitude can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV_relative_magnitude = sqrt(V_relative_x^2 + V_relative_y^2)\nV_relative_magnitude = sqrt(16.38^2 + 6.49^2)\nV_relative_magnitude ≈ 17.54 knots\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nDirection = arctan(V_relative_y / V_relative_x)\nDirection = arctan(6.49 / 16.38)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nDirection ≈ 21.8°\n\nSince the ship is moving North of East, the direction is 21.8° North of East.\n\nSo, the ship's velocity relative to the ground has a magnitude of approximately 17.54 knots and a direction of 21.8° North of East."
