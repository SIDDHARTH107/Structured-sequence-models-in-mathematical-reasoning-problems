    "message_2": "Since $K$ is a 1-dimensional submanifold of the closed, orientable 3-dimensional manifold $M$, it is a knot or a link in $M$. A regular neighborhood $K'$ of $K$ in $M$ is a tubular neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the product of $K$ and an open disk. In other words, $K'$ is a thickening of $K$ in $M$.\n\nNow, we are asked to find the number of points in the intersection $K \\cap K'$. Since $K'$ is a neighborhood of $K$, it contains $K$ entirely. Therefore, the intersection $K \\cap K'$ is just $K$ itself. \n\nHowever, the question seems to assume that the intersection consists of a finite number $n$ of points, which is not the case in general. The intersection $K \\cap K'$ is the entire knot or link $K$, which is a 1-dimensional submanifold, not a finite set of points. \n\nSo, the problem as stated is not well-posed, and it is not possible to find a finite value for $n$ in general."
