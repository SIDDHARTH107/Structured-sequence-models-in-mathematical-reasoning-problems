    "message_2": "To find the homotopy group $\\pi_2(S^2)$ with respect to the function $f$, we first need to understand the action of $f$ on $S^2$. Let's analyze the rotations about the $x$-axis and the $z$-axis separately.\n\n1. Rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians about the $x$-axis: This rotation maps the point $(x, y, z)$ on $S^2$ to the point $(x, -z, y)$.\n\n2. Rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians about the $z$-axis: This rotation maps the point $(x, y, z)$ on $S^2$ to the point $(-y, x, z)$.\n\nNow, let's apply these rotations sequentially to a point $(x, y, z)$ on $S^2$. After the first rotation, we have the point $(x, -z, y)$. Applying the second rotation to this point, we get $(-(-z), x, y) = (z, x, y)$. So, the function $f$ maps the point $(x, y, z)$ on $S^2$ to the point $(z, x, y)$.\n\nNow, let's find the homotopy group $\\pi_2(S^2)$ with respect to $f$. Recall that the homotopy group $\\pi_2(S^2)$ is the set of homotopy classes of maps from $S^2$ to itself, with the group operation given by the composition of maps. Since $S^2$ is simply connected, its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^2) = 0$. This implies that the higher homotopy groups are also trivial, i.e., $\\pi_n(S^2) = 0$ for $n > 1$.\n\nHowever, we are interested in the homotopy group with respect to the function $f$. To find this, we need to consider the action of $f$ on the homotopy classes of maps from $S^2$ to itself. Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the homotopy groups. In particular, $f$ induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_2(S^2)$, which is the trivial group. Therefore, the homotopy group $\\pi_2(S^2)$ with respect to $f$ is also the trivial group, i.e., $\\pi_2(S^2) = 0$."
