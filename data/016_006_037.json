    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern fractal is generated using an iterated function system (IFS) with four affine transformations. The length of the main stem and the smallest stem are determined by the scaling factors of these transformations. \n\nThe scaling factors for the four transformations are as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (f1): 0.0 (accounts for 1% of the points)\n2. Transformation 2 (f2): 0.85 (accounts for 85% of the points)\n3. Transformation 3 (f3): 0.2 (accounts for 7% of the points)\n4. Transformation 4 (f4): -0.15 (accounts for 7% of the points)\n\nThe length of the main stem is determined by the second transformation (f2), which has a scaling factor of 0.85. The length of the smallest stem is determined by the third and fourth transformations (f3 and f4), which have scaling factors of 0.2 and -0.15, respectively.\n\nTo find the scale factor of the Barnsley fern fractal, we need to determine the ratio between the length of the main stem and the length of the smallest stem. Since the length of the main stem is 1 unit and the length of the smallest stem is 0.1 units, the scale factor is:\n\nScale factor = Length of the smallest stem / Length of the main stem\nScale factor = 0.1 / 1\nScale factor = 0.1\n\nSo, the scale factor of the Barnsley fern fractal is 0.1."
