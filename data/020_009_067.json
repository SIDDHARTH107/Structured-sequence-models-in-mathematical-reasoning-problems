    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. The factory has a total production capacity of 800 units per day. It takes 4 hours to produce a unit of A and 5 hours to produce a unit of B. The profit earned from the sale of A and B is $12 and $15 respectively. The factory has a workforce of 60 members who can work for 8 hours per day. Each member can work on either A or B, but not both. If the demand for A and B is unlimited, then how many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize its profit, taking into account the stochasticity of the workforce where the productivity level of each worker follows a normal distribution with mean 80% and standard deviation 10%?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe total production capacity constraint is:\nx + y ≤ 800\n\nThe total available work hours are 60 workers * 8 hours = 480 hours.\n\nTaking into account the stochasticity of the workforce, the average productivity level is 80%, so the effective work hours are 480 * 0.8 = 384 hours.\n\nThe time constraint for producing A and B is:\n4x + 5y ≤ 384\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 12x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal production levels, we can use linear programming techniques. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 800\n2. 4x + 5y ≤ 384\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices (0, 0), (0, 76.8), (96, 0), and (64, 64).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 12(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 76.8) = 12(0) + 15(76.8) = $1,152\n3. P(96, 0) = 12(96) + 15(0) = $1,152\n4. P(64, 64) = 12(64) + 15(64) = $1,728\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (64, 64), with a profit of $1,728.\n\nTherefore, the factory should produce 64 units of product A and 64 units of product B to maximize its profit, taking into account the stochasticity of the workforce."
