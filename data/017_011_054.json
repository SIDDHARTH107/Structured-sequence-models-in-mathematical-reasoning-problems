    "message_2": "To prove that G must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will use the Sylow Theorems and analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow Theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 12. The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3^1. By the Sylow Theorems, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3.\n\nLet n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By Sylow's Third Theorem, n_2 divides 12 and n_2 ≡ 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be either 1 or 3. Similarly, n_3 divides 12 and n_3 ≡ 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, they must be normal in G (by Sylow's Second Theorem). Let P be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and Q be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Since P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since |P| = 4 and |Q| = 3 are relatively prime, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 12, so PQ = G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIf there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 3-subgroup, the Sylow 3-subgroup Q must be normal in G (by Sylow's Second Theorem). Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Then, |P ∩ Q| = 1, since their orders are relatively prime. The group G acts on the set of left cosets of Q by left multiplication, and this action induces a homomorphism φ: G → Sym(Q). The kernel of φ is the normal core of Q in G, which is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in Q. Since Q is normal in G, the normal core of Q in G is Q itself, and the image of φ is a subgroup of Sym(Q) isomorphic to G/Q.\n\nNow, |Sym(Q)| = 3! = 6, and |G/Q| = |G| / |Q| = 12 / 3 = 4. Thus, the image of φ is a subgroup of Sym(Q) of order 4. The only such subgroups are the Klein four-group V_4 and the cyclic group C4. If the image of φ is V_4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is the dihedral group D6. If the image of φ is C4, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group C12. However, we already considered the case where G is isomorphic to C12, so in this case, G must be isomorphic to D6.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups, the Sylow 2-subgroup P must be normal in G (by Sylow's Second Theorem). Since |G| = 12 and |P| = 4, |G/P| = 3. Thus, G/P is a cyclic group of order 3. The only group of order 12 with a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a cyclic quotient of order 3 is the alternating group A4. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to A4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
