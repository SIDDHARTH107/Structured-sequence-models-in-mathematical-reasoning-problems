    "message_1": "In a study of a new drug for cancer treatment, researchers followed 70 patients who received the drug. Out of these patients, 35 survived beyond 3 years while the rest died within 3 years. The survival function for the drug can be expressed as S(t), where t is the number of years since the start of the study. \n\nWhat is the probability that a patient will survive beyond 4 years?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that a patient will survive beyond 4 years, we need more information about the survival function S(t). The given information only tells us the survival rate at 3 years, which is 35 out of 70 patients, or 50%. Without knowing the specific form of the survival function S(t) or additional data points, we cannot accurately calculate the probability of survival beyond 4 years."
