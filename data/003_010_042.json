    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the flagpole) to the adjacent side (distance from the person to the flagpole).\n\nLet h be the height of the flagpole. We have:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(30°) = h / 20\n\nWe know that tan(30°) = 1/√3. So,\n\n1/√3 = h / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 20 * (1/√3)\n\nTo simplify, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by √3:\n\nh = 20 * (√3/3)\n\nh ≈ 20 * (1.732 / 3)\nh ≈ 20 * 0.577\nh ≈ 11.54\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the flagpole is approximately 12 meters."
