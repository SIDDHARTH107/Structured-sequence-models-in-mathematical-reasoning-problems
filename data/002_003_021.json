    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * side^2\n\nIn this case, the side of the cube measures 8 cm. So, we can plug in the value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (8 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 6 * 64 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 384 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 384 square centimeters."
