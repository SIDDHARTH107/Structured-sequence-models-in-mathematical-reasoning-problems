The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}\nA ∩ B = {3, 7}\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection of (A △ B) with the set {3, 4, 5, 6}:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {4, 5, 6}\n\nSo, the final result is {4, 5, 6}."
