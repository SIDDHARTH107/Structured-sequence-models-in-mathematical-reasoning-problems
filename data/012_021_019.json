The treewidth of G is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions.\n\nA tree decomposition of G is a tree T where each node i in T is associated with a bag B_i, which is a subset of vertices of G, such that:\n\na. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of G.\nb. For each edge (u, v) in G, there exists a bag B_i that contains both u and v.\nc. For each vertex v in G, the set of bags containing v forms a connected subtree of T.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can construct a tree decomposition as follows:\n\n1. T = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n2. B_1 = {1, 2, 4}\n3. B_2 = {2, 3, 5}\n4. B_3 = {3, 4, 6}\n5. B_4 = {4, 5, 7}\n6. B_5 = {5, 6, 8}\n7. B_6 = {6, 7, 9}\n8. B_7 = {7, 8}\n9. B_8 = {8, 9}\n\nThe tree T is a path with nodes 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8. The width of this tree decomposition is max(|B_i|) - 1 for all i. In this case, the maximum size of the bags is 3, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of the given graph G is 2."
