    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The profit earned from product A is $5 per unit, and the profit earned from product B is $10 per unit. The production process for both products require the same resources, but product A requires 2 hours of labor per unit, and product B requires 3 hours of labor per unit. The factory has 120 hours of labor available per day. What is the maximum profit that the factory can earn per day, assuming that it produces and sells some units of both products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced per day. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 10y, subject to the constraint that 2x + 3y ≤ 120 (due to the labor hours available).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of linear programming. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraint:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (120 - 2x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy this inequality. Since we are producing some units of both products, x and y must be greater than 0.\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (120 - 2x) / 3:\n   (0, 40)\n\n2. Intersection of y = 0 and y = (120 - 2x) / 3:\n   (60, 0)\n\n3. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0:\n   (0, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 40) = 5(0) + 10(40) = $400\n2. P(60, 0) = 5(60) + 10(0) = $300\n3. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 10(0) = $0\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 40), with a profit of $400 per day. Therefore, the factory should produce 0 units of product A and 40 units of product B to maximize its profit."
