    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n\nAs you can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) are equal, both resulting in the same set of ordered pairs. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. \n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is not commutative, we need to show that A × B ≠ B × A. As we have already calculated:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, as the ordered pairs are different. Therefore, the Cartesian product is not commutative with respect to union."
