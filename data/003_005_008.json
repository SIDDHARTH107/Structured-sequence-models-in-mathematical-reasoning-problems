    "message_2": "To find the value of arccos(0.5), we need to determine the angle whose cosine is 0.5. \n\nRecall that the cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In this case, we are looking for an angle where the adjacent side is half the length of the hypotenuse. \n\nThis occurs in a 30-60-90 triangle, where the ratio of the sides is 1:√3:2. In this triangle, the cosine of the 60-degree angle (π/3 radians) is 0.5.\n\nSo, arccos(0.5) = 60° or π/3 radians."
