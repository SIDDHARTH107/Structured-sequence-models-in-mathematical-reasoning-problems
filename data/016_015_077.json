    "message_2": "The length of the Hilbert curve increases with each iteration. In general, the length of the nth iteration of the Hilbert curve (L_n) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nL_n = (2^n - 1) * L_0\n\nwhere L_0 is the length of the initial square (in this case, 1).\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we have:\n\nL_4 = (2^4 - 1) * 1\nL_4 = (16 - 1) * 1\nL_4 = 15\n\nSo, the length of the 4th iteration of the Hilbert curve with an initial square length of 1 is 15."
