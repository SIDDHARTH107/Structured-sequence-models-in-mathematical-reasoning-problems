    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change with the number of iterations. It remains constant and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each segment is divided into 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), and each piece is 1/3 the size of the original segment (M = 3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after 5 iterations (or any number of iterations) is approximately 1.2619."
