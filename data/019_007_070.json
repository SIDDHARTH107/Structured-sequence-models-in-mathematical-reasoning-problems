    "message_1": "Sorry, but it's not possible to create a precise numerical problem related to Non-monotonic logic without further information. Non-monotonic logic deals with reasoning that may not preserve truth as new information is added. It involves rules of interpretation and is often applied in artificial intelligence and philosophy. Could you please provide more context so I can create a suitable question?",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are looking for a problem related to non-monotonic logic. While it's difficult to create a precise numerical problem, I can provide you with a simple example that demonstrates the concept of non-monotonic reasoning.\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n1. Birds can fly.\n2. Penguins are birds.\n3. Penguins cannot fly.\n\nNow, let's reason about these statements using non-monotonic logic.\n\nInitially, we only have the first statement: \"Birds can fly.\" Based on this information, we can conclude that if we encounter a bird, it can fly.\n\nNext, we add the second statement: \"Penguins are birds.\" Now, we can still conclude that if we encounter a bird, it can fly, since we have no information that contradicts this conclusion.\n\nFinally, we add the third statement: \"Penguins cannot fly.\" This new information contradicts our previous conclusion. Now, we can no longer conclude that if we encounter a bird, it can fly. Instead, we need to revise our reasoning to account for the fact that some birds (specifically, penguins) cannot fly.\n\nThis example demonstrates the concept of non-monotonic reasoning, where the addition of new information can lead to a change in our conclusions. While this example does not involve numerical calculations, it illustrates the key idea behind non-monotonic logic."
