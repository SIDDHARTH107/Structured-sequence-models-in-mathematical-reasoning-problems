He also knows that if it's not sunny today, then it will not be raining tomorrow. If John knows that it's not raining tomorrow, what can he conclude about whether it's sunny today or not?",
    "message_2": "Using modal logic, we can represent the given information as follows:\n\n1. If it's sunny today (S), then it will be raining tomorrow (R): S → R\n2. If it's not sunny today (¬S), then it will not be raining tomorrow (¬R): ¬S → ¬R\n3. John knows that it's not raining tomorrow: ¬R\n\nNow, we want to find out what John can conclude about whether it's sunny today or not.\n\nFrom the second statement (¬S → ¬R), we can use the contrapositive rule, which states that if A → B, then ¬B → ¬A. In this case, we get:\n\n4. If it's raining tomorrow (R), then it's sunny today (S): R → S\n\nSince John knows that it's not raining tomorrow (¬R), we can use the first statement (S → R) and the third statement (¬R) to deduce the following:\n\n5. It's not sunny today: ¬S\n\nSo, John can conclude that it's not sunny today."
