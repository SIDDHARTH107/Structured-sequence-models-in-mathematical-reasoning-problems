    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific problem:\n\nConsider the differential equation $y''(z)+2y'(z)+5y(z) = e^{-z}$, where $y(z)$ is a complex-valued function of a complex variable $z$. Find a particular solution $y_p(z)$ that is entire, i.e., holomorphic on the entire complex plane $z\\in \\mathbb{C}$, and determine the general solution $y(z)$ of the differential equation.",
    "message_2": "To find a particular solution $y_p(z)$, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. We guess a solution of the form $y_p(z) = Ae^{-z}$, where $A$ is a complex constant. We will differentiate this guess twice and plug it into the differential equation to solve for $A$.\n\nFirst, we find the first and second derivatives of $y_p(z)$:\n\n$y_p'(z) = -Ae^{-z}$\n\n$y_p''(z) = Ae^{-z}$\n\nNow, we plug these into the differential equation:\n\n$y_p''(z) + 2y_p'(z) + 5y_p(z) = e^{-z}$\n\n$Ae^{-z} - 2Ae^{-z} + 5Ae^{-z} = e^{-z}$\n\nFactoring out $Ae^{-z}$, we get:\n\n$(1 - 2 + 5)Ae^{-z} = e^{-z}$\n\n$4Ae^{-z} = e^{-z}$\n\nNow, we can solve for $A$:\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nSo, our particular solution is:\n\n$y_p(z) = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-z}$\n\nNow, we need to find the complementary solution $y_c(z)$. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\n$r^2 + 2r + 5 = 0$\n\nThis equation has complex roots:\n\n$r = -1 \\pm 2i$\n\nSo, the complementary solution is:\n\n$y_c(z) = C_1e^{(-1+2i)z} + C_2e^{(-1-2i)z}$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are complex constants.\n\nFinally, the general solution of the differential equation is the sum of the particular and complementary solutions:\n\n$y(z) = y_c(z) + y_p(z) = C_1e^{(-1+2i)z} + C_2e^{(-1-2i)z} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-z}$"
