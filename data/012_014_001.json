Determine whether G and H are isomorphic or not.",
    "message_2": "To determine if two graphs G and H are isomorphic, we need to find a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between their vertex sets such that the adjacency relationship is preserved.\n\nLet's try to find a bijection between the vertex sets of G and H:\n\nWe can map the vertices of G to the vertices of H as follows:\na → 1\nb → 2\nc → 3\nd → 4\n\nNow let's check if the adjacency relationship is preserved:\n\nIn graph G, the edges are:\n(a, b), (b, c), (c, d), (d, a)\n\nIn graph H, the edges are:\n(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)\n\nUnder the mapping, the edges of G become:\n(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)\n\nSince the edge sets are the same after applying the bijection, the adjacency relationship is preserved. Therefore, graphs G and H are isomorphic."
