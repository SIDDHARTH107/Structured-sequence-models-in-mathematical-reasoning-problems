    "message_2": "Let x be the number of students studying both mathematics and physics. Since every student is studying at least one of the subjects, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students studying both subjects.\n\nTotal students = Students studying mathematics + Students studying physics - Students studying both subjects\n14 = 9 + 5 - x\n14 = 14 - x\nx = 0\n\nSo, there are 0 students studying both mathematics and physics."
