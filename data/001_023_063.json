    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin x = 0.5 for x, where x is between 0 and 360 degrees, we need to find the angles whose sine value is 0.5.\n\nsin x = 0.5\n\nx = arcsin(0.5)\n\nThere are two angles between 0 and 360 degrees that have a sine value of 0.5. These angles are:\n\nx = 30 degrees (since sin(30) = 0.5)\nand\nx = 150 degrees (since sin(150) = 0.5)\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation sin x = 0.5 between 0 and 360 degrees are x = 30 degrees and x = 150 degrees."
