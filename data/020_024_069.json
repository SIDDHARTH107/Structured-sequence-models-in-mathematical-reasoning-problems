    "message_1": "A company sells a product for $50 per unit. The fixed cost of manufacturing the product is $5000 and the variable cost per unit is $20. What is the optimal number of units that the company needs to produce and sell to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the number of units that will result in the highest profit. The profit function can be represented as:\n\nProfit = (Revenue - Total Cost) = (Price per unit * Number of units) - (Fixed Cost + Variable Cost per unit * Number of units)\n\nGiven the values:\nPrice per unit = $50\nFixed Cost = $5000\nVariable Cost per unit = $20\n\nLet x be the number of units produced and sold. Then the profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit(x) = (50x) - (5000 + 20x)\n\nSimplifying the profit function, we get:\n\nProfit(x) = 30x - 5000\n\nTo find the optimal number of units to maximize profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. Since this is a linear function, there is no maximum or minimum point. However, we can find the break-even point, which is the point where the company starts making a profit.\n\nTo find the break-even point, we set the profit function to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 30x - 5000\n\nAdding 5000 to both sides:\n\n5000 = 30x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 30:\n\nx = 5000 / 30\nx â‰ˆ 166.67\n\nSince the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, they need to produce and sell at least 167 units to start making a profit. Beyond this point, the profit will increase linearly with the number of units produced and sold. Therefore, there is no optimal number of units to maximize profit, as the profit will keep increasing as long as the company produces and sells more units."
