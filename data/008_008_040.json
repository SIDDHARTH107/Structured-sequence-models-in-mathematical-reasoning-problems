To produce each unit of product A, it requires 2 hours of processing time on machine 1 and 1 hour of processing time on machine 2. To produce each unit of product B, it requires 1 hour of processing time on machine 1 and 1.5 hours of processing time on machine 2. Machine 1 can operate for at most 10 hours per day and machine 2 can operate for at most 8 hours per day. If the profit per unit of product A is $5 and the profit per unit of product B is $7.50, determine the production quantities that will maximize the company's daily profit.\"",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7.5y.\n\nThe constraints are given by the processing times on the machines:\n1. 2x + y ≤ 10 (Machine 1)\n2. x + 1.5y ≤ 8 (Machine 2)\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ -2x + 10\n2. y ≤ -(2/3)x + 16/3\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 5.333), (3, 2), and (5, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7.5(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 5.333) = 5(0) + 7.5(5.333) = $40\n3. P(3, 2) = 5(3) + 7.5(2) = $29.5\n4. P(5, 0) = 5(5) + 7.5(0) = $25\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 0 units of product A and 5.333 units of product B, with a daily profit of $40. However, since we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 5 units of product B, resulting in a daily profit of $37.50."
