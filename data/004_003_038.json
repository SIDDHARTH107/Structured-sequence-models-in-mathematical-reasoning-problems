    "message_1": "A farmer wants to fence in a rectangular plot of land along a river using 200 meters of fencing. The river will be one side of the plot. What dimensions will give the largest area?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the fence parallel to the river be x meters and the length of the fence perpendicular to the river be y meters. Since the river will be one side of the plot, the farmer will only need to use fencing for the other three sides. Therefore, the total fencing used can be represented as:\n\nx + 2y = 200\n\nWe want to find the dimensions that will give the largest area. The area of the rectangular plot can be represented as:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nWe can solve for y in terms of x from the fencing equation:\n\ny = (200 - x) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the area equation:\n\nArea = x * ((200 - x) / 2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nArea = (200x - x^2) / 2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dx = (200 - 2x) / 2 = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\n2x = 200\nx = 100\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (200 - 100) / 2\ny = 50\n\nSo, the dimensions that will give the largest area are x = 100 meters and y = 50 meters. The rectangular plot will be 100 meters along the river and 50 meters perpendicular to the river."
