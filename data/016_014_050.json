    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the Lévy C curve for n = 10, we can use the given formula:\n\nlength = lim (m->inf) [l(1)/2 + l(2)/2 + ... + l(m)/2 + l(m+1)].\n\nSince l(n) = (1/2)^[(n+1)/2], we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nlength = lim (m->inf) [(1/2)^[(1+1)/2]/2 + (1/2)^[(2+1)/2]/2 + ... + (1/2)^[(m+1)/2]/2 + (1/2)^[(m+2)/2]].\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term a = (1/2)^1 and the common ratio r = (1/2)^1/2. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:\n\nsum = a / (1 - r).\n\nPlugging in the values for a and r, we get:\n\nlength = ((1/2)^1) / (1 - (1/2)^1/2).\n\nCalculating the length:\n\nlength ≈ 0.5 / (1 - 0.7071) ≈ 0.5 / 0.2929 ≈ 1.7071.\n\nRounding the final answer to two decimal places, the approximate length of the Lévy C curve for n = 10 is 1.71."
