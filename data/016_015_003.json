    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in complexity with each order. In each order, the curve is composed of 4 smaller Hilbert curves from the previous order connected by 3 segments. The total length of the curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (4^n - 1) / 3 * s\n\nwhere n is the order of the curve and s is the length of each smaller segment.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 4 with each smaller segment length being 1 unit, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nLength = (4^4 - 1) / 3 * 1\nLength = (256 - 1) / 3\nLength = 255 / 3\nLength = 85 units\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert curve of order 4 with each smaller segment length being 1 unit is 85 units."
