    "message_1": "A game is played between two players A and B. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three actions: Rock (R), Paper (P), or Scissors (S). If both players choose the same action, the game is a tie. If not, the winner is determined as follows:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beat Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nPlayer A's strategy is to randomly choose an action with equal probability. Player B's strategy is to choose Paper (P) 40% of the time, Rock (R) 35% of the time, and Scissors (S) 25% of the time.\n\nWhat is the probability that player B wins the game?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that player B wins the game, we need to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities. Let's denote the probability of player A choosing Rock, Paper, and Scissors as P(A=R), P(A=P), and P(A=S) respectively. Similarly, let's denote the probability of player B choosing Rock, Paper, and Scissors as P(B=R), P(B=P), and P(B=S) respectively.\n\nSince player A chooses an action with equal probability, we have:\n\nP(A=R) = P(A=P) = P(A=S) = 1/3\n\nFor player B, we are given the probabilities:\n\nP(B=R) = 0.35\nP(B=P) = 0.40\nP(B=S) = 0.25\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of player B winning, which can happen in the following scenarios:\n\n1. Player A chooses Rock, and player B chooses Paper.\n2. Player A chooses Paper, and player B chooses Scissors.\n3. Player A chooses Scissors, and player B chooses Rock.\n\nThe probability of each scenario happening is the product of the probabilities of each player's action. So, we have:\n\n1. P(A=R) * P(B=P) = (1/3) * 0.40 = 4/30\n2. P(A=P) * P(B=S) = (1/3) * 0.25 = 1/12\n3. P(A=S) * P(B=R) = (1/3) * 0.35 = 7/60\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities of these scenarios to find the overall probability of player B winning:\n\nP(B wins) = 4/30 + 1/12 + 7/60\n          = 8/60 + 5/60 + 7/60\n          = 20/60\n\nTherefore, the probability that player B wins the game is 20/60, which simplifies to 1/3 or approximately 0.3333."
