    "message_1": "Suppose there are two bidders in an auction for a painting. Bidder A values the painting at $8000, while bidder B values it at $9000. If the auction is a second-price sealed-bid auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid, what is the optimal bid for each bidder?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, it is a weakly dominant strategy for each bidder to bid their true valuation of the item. This means that the optimal bid for each bidder is equal to the value they place on the painting.\n\nSo, the optimal bid for Bidder A is $8000, and the optimal bid for Bidder B is $9000. If both bidders follow this strategy, Bidder B will win the auction and pay $8000, which is the second-highest bid."
