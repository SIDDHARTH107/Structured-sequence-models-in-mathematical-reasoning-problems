Use modal logic to provide the truth values for the following modal propositions:\n\n1. ◊p ∧ ◻q (There exists a possible world where it is sunny today and it must be the case that I am happy today)\n2. □(p → r)  (In all possible worlds, if it is sunny today, then I have completed my homework today)\n\nDetermine whether each is true, false or undefined.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the basics of modal logic. In modal logic, we have two types of modal operators: possibility (◊) and necessity (□). A proposition with a possibility operator is true if there exists at least one possible world where the proposition is true. A proposition with a necessity operator is true if the proposition is true in all possible worlds.\n\nNow let's analyze the given modal propositions:\n\n1. ◊p ∧ □q (There exists a possible world where it is sunny today and it must be the case that I am happy today)\n\nFor this proposition to be true, there must exist at least one possible world where it is sunny today (p is true), and in all possible worlds, I am happy today (q is true).\n\nSince we don't have any information about the possible worlds, we cannot determine whether there exists a possible world where it is sunny today. Similarly, we cannot determine whether I am happy today in all possible worlds. Therefore, the truth value of this proposition is undefined.\n\n2. □(p → r) (In all possible worlds, if it is sunny today, then I have completed my homework today)\n\nFor this proposition to be true, in every possible world, if it is sunny today (p is true), then I have completed my homework today (r is true).\n\nAgain, we don't have any information about the possible worlds, so we cannot determine whether the given implication (p → r) is true in all possible worlds. Therefore, the truth value of this proposition is also undefined."
