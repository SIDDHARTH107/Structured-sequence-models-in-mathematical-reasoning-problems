    "message_1": "A tower is standing vertically on the ground. From a certain point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 30 degrees. If the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the tower is 50 meters, what is the height of the tower (to the nearest meter)?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using trigonometry. In this case, we have a right triangle formed by the tower (height), the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the tower (base), and the line connecting the point on the ground to the top of the tower (hypotenuse). The angle of elevation is given as 30 degrees.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to find the height of the tower:\n\ntan(angle) = (height) / (base)\n\ntan(30) = (height) / (50)\n\nTo find the tangent of 30 degrees, we can either use a calculator or recall that tan(30) = 1 / √3 ≈ 0.577.\n\n0.577 = (height) / (50)\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 0.577 * 50 ≈ 28.85\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the tower is approximately 29 meters."
