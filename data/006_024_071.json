    "message_1": "A survey shows that on a typical trip, the probability of experiencing a delay of less than 10 minutes is 0.6 and the probability of experiencing a delay of more than 20 minutes is 0.2. What is the probability of experiencing a delay between 10 and 20 minutes on a typical trip?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of experiencing a delay between 10 and 20 minutes, we can use the fact that the sum of all probabilities in a sample space is equal to 1. \n\nLet P(10-20) be the probability of experiencing a delay between 10 and 20 minutes. Since there are only three possible outcomes (less than 10 minutes, between 10 and 20 minutes, and more than 20 minutes), we can write the equation:\n\nP(<10) + P(10-20) + P(>20) = 1\n\nSubstitute the given probabilities:\n\n0.6 + P(10-20) + 0.2 = 1\n\nNow, solve for P(10-20):\n\nP(10-20) = 1 - 0.6 - 0.2\nP(10-20) = 0.2\n\nSo, the probability of experiencing a delay between 10 and 20 minutes on a typical trip is 0.2 or 20%."
