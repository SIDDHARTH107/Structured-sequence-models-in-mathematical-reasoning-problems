    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of winning this game of chance, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 5 or a 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nThere are 2 successful outcomes (rolling a 5 or a 6) and 6 possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nThe probability of winning the game is:\n\nP(winning) = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2/6\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nP(winning) = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game of chance is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333, which is about 33.33%."
