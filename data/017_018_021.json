    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 32, we first need to find the total number of groups of order 32 and then subtract the number of abelian groups of order 32.\n\nThe total number of groups of order 32 can be found using the formula for the number of groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer. In this case, p = 2 and n = 5, so the order is 2^5 = 32.\n\nThe formula for the number of groups of order p^n is given by:\n\nf(n) = (1/n) * ∑(d | n) * μ(n/d) * p^(d^2)\n\nwhere d ranges over the divisors of n, and μ is the Möbius function.\n\nFor n = 5, the divisors are 1 and 5. So,\n\nf(5) = (1/5) * (μ(5/1) * 2^(1^2) + μ(5/5) * 2^(5^2))\n     = (1/5) * (μ(5) * 2^1 + μ(1) * 2^25)\n     = (1/5) * (-1 * 2 + 1 * 33554432)\n     = (1/5) * 33554430\n     = 6710886\n\nSo, there are 6,710,886 groups of order 32.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 32. The number of abelian groups of order p^n is given by the partition function P(n). For n = 5, P(5) = 7. Therefore, there are 7 abelian groups of order 32.\n\nNow, we can find the number of non-abelian groups of order 32 by subtracting the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups:\n\n6,710,886 - 7 = 6,710,879\n\nHowever, this result is incorrect. The formula used above for the number of groups of order p^n is not valid for non-abelian groups. The correct approach is to use the Sylow theorems and the structure of p-groups.\n\nFor a group of order 32, we have the following possible structures:\n\n1. C_32\n2. C_16 x C_2\n3. C_8 x C_4\n4. C_8 x C_2 x C_2\n5. C_4 x C_4 x C_2\n6. C_4 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2\n7. C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2\n\nThe first six structures correspond to abelian groups. The last structure, C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2, can give rise to non-abelian groups. There are six non-abelian groups of order 32 that can be derived from this structure:\n\n1. Dihedral group D_16\n2. Quaternion group Q_16\n3. Semidirect product of C_4 x C_4 and C_2\n4. Semidirect product of C_8 and C_2 x C_2\n5. Semidirect product of C_4 x C_2 and C_2 x C_2\n6. Semidirect product of C_2 x C_2 x C_2 and C_2 x C_2\n\nSo, there are six non-abelian groups of order 32."
