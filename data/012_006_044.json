    "message_2": "A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex). Let's analyze the given graph with 10 vertices and 14 edges.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph could be a tree with 9 edges and an additional 5 edges connecting some of the vertices. In this case, there would be at least 4 vertices with an odd degree (the leaves of the tree), which would not satisfy the conditions for an Eulerian path.\n\nHowever, it is still possible to construct a graph with 10 vertices and 14 edges that has an Eulerian path. Here's an example:\n\n1. Start with a cycle of 6 vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F) connected in a circle: A-B-C-D-E-F-A.\n2. Add 4 more vertices (G, H, I, J) and connect them as follows: G-A, H-B, I-C, J-D.\n3. Add 2 more edges: G-H and I-J.\n\nThis graph has 10 vertices and 14 edges. The degrees of the vertices are:\n\nA: 4\nB: 4\nC: 4\nD: 4\nE: 2\nF: 2\nG: 3\nH: 3\nI: 3\nJ: 3\n\nThere are exactly 2 vertices with an odd degree (E and F), so this graph has an Eulerian path. One possible Eulerian path is:\n\nE-A-B-H-G-A-F-C-I-J-D-C-B-A-D-E"
