    "message_2": "Using relevance logic, we cannot deduce the conclusion that y + 1 > 6 from the given premises. \n\nRelevance logic requires that the premises be relevant to the conclusion. In this case, the first premise is about x, and the second premise is a disjunction involving x and y. The conclusion, however, is only about y. \n\nWhile the second premise does mention y, it is not enough to deduce the conclusion. The second premise states that either x < 4 or y > 5, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between x and y. \n\nTherefore, using relevance logic, we cannot deduce the conclusion that y + 1 > 6 from the given premises."
