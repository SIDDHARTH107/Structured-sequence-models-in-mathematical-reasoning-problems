    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted a message that was encrypted using a Rail Fence cipher with a key of 3. The message reads: \"TNHHMRSEETAOYFEHOOOZLRPUO\". Using cryptanalysis, what is the original plaintext message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail Fence cipher with a key of 3, we need to arrange the ciphertext in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows. The length of the ciphertext is 24, so we can divide it into 8 columns. The arrangement will look like this:\n\nT _ _ H _ _ M\n_ N _ _ R _ _ S\n_ _ E _ _ T _ _\n\n_ A _ _ O _ _ Y\n_ _ F _ _ E _ _\n_ _ _ H _ _ O _\n\n_ _ _ O _ _ Z\n_ _ _ _ L _ _ R\n_ _ _ _ _ P _ U\n\nNow, we can read the plaintext message by following the zigzag pattern:\n\nT -> N -> E -> H -> A -> F -> M -> O -> R -> H -> S -> O -> E -> L -> T -> P -> A -> U -> O -> Y -> Z -> R\n\nThe original plaintext message is \"THENEWYORKTIMESHALFPUZZLE\"."
