    "message_2": "To find all possible group structures for a group of order 36, we first find all possible divisors of 36. The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. For each divisor, we will consider the possible structures of a group of that order.\n\n1. Cyclic group C36: This group has order 36 and is generated by a single element of order 36. It is isomorphic to itself.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: We can have C2 × C18, C3 × C12, C4 × C9, and C6 × C6. Among these, C6 × C6 is isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\n3. Semidirect product of two cyclic groups: We can have C2 ⋊ C18, C3 ⋊ C12, C4 ⋊ C9, and C6 ⋊ C6. Among these, C3 ⋊ C12 and C4 ⋊ C9 are isomorphic to two of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\n4. Direct product of three cyclic groups: We can have C2 × C2 × C9 and C3 × C3 × C4. Among these, C3 × C3 × C4 is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3.\n\n5. Semidirect product of three cyclic groups: We can have C2 ⋊ (C2 × C9), C2 ⋊ (C3 × C6), C3 ⋊ (C3 × C4), and C6 ⋊ (C2 × C3). Among these, C2 ⋊ (C3 × C6) and C6 ⋊ (C2 × C3) are isomorphic to two of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nSo, we have found the following group structures for a group of order 36:\n\n1. Cyclic group C36\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C2 × C18, C3 × C12, C4 × C9, and C6 × C6\n3. Semidirect product of two cyclic groups: C2 ⋊ C18, C3 ⋊ C12, C4 ⋊ C9, and C6 ⋊ C6\n4. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C2 × C2 × C9 and C3 × C3 × C4\n5. Semidirect product of three cyclic groups: C2 ⋊ (C2 × C9), C2 ⋊ (C3 × C6), C3 ⋊ (C3 × C4), and C6 ⋊ (C2 × C3)\n\nAmong these, the following are isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36:\n\n1. Cyclic group C36\n2. C6 × C6 (non-abelian)\n3. C3 ⋊ C12 and C4 ⋊ C9 (non-abelian)\n4. C3 × C3 × C4 (A4 × C3)\n5. C2 ⋊ (C3 × C6) and C6 ⋊ (C2 × C3) (non-abelian)"
