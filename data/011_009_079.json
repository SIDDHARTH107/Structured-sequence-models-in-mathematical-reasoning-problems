    "message_1": "A restaurant offers 5 different dishes and a customer wants to order a meal consisting of exactly 3 dishes. How many different combinations of dishes can the customer choose from if they are allowed to order the same dish more than once? Use Bell numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. However, in this problem, we are not partitioning a set, but rather choosing combinations of dishes with repetition allowed. Therefore, we will use a different method to solve this problem.\n\nSince the customer can order the same dish more than once, we can use the combination with repetition formula to solve this problem. The formula for combination with repetition is:\n\nC(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)! / (r! * (n-1)!)\n\nwhere n is the number of different dishes (5 in this case) and r is the number of dishes the customer wants to order (3 in this case).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(5+3-1, 3) = C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * 4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 5040 / (6 * 24) = 5040 / 144 = 35\n\nTherefore, the customer can choose from 35 different combinations of dishes."
