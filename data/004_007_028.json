    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x):\n\nf(x) = 5x^2\nf'(x) = d(5x^2)/dx = 10x\n\ng(x) = cos(x)\ng'(x) = d(cos(x))/dx = -sin(x)\n\nNow, we will apply the chain rule to find the derivative of f(g(x)):\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nh'(x) = (10 * g(x)) * (-sin(x))\nh'(x) = (10 * cos(x)) * (-sin(x))\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) is:\n\nh'(x) = -10 * cos(x) * sin(x)"
