    "message_1": "Five friends went to a restaurant and ordered 2 burgers, 1 pizza, and 3 sodas. The total cost was $28. The restaurant also charges an additional $3 for every table they use. However, there were three tables available, which means they incurred $9 additional charges. \n\nAssuming that the cost of each burger, pizza, and soda were the same, find the cost of each item. Write the system of linear equations and solve it.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the cost of a burger as B, the cost of a pizza as P, and the cost of a soda as S. We know that the total cost of the food items and the table charges is $28. We can write this as:\n\n2B + P + 3S + 9 = 28\n\nSince we know that the table charges are $9, we can subtract this from the total cost to find the total cost of the food items:\n\n2B + P + 3S = 28 - 9\n2B + P + 3S = 19\n\nNow we have one equation with three variables. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to solve this equation for the individual costs of the burger, pizza, and soda. We would need at least two more equations with the same variables to solve for B, P, and S."
