    "message_1": "A recent survey suggests that 70% of eligible voters plan to vote in the upcoming election. If a random sample of 300 eligible voters is taken, what is the probability that at least 200 of them plan to vote?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (voters who plan to vote) in n trials (sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 70% or 0.7)\n- n is the sample size (300 eligible voters)\n- k is the number of successes (at least 200 voters who plan to vote)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 200 voters planning to vote, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 200, 201, ..., 300.\n\nP(X ≥ 200) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 200 to 300\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive, so we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The normal approximation uses the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution:\n\nμ = n * p = 300 * 0.7 = 210\nσ = √(n * p * (1-p)) = √(300 * 0.7 * 0.3) ≈ 8.37\n\nNow, we can standardize the value of k (200) using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (k - μ) / σ = (200 - 210) / 8.37 ≈ -1.19\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability of having a z-score less than -1.19:\n\nP(Z < -1.19) ≈ 0.117\n\nHowever, we want the probability of at least 200 voters, so we need to find the complement of this probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 200) = 1 - P(Z < -1.19) = 1 - 0.117 ≈ 0.883\n\nSo, the probability that at least 200 of the 300 eligible voters in the sample plan to vote is approximately 88.3%."
