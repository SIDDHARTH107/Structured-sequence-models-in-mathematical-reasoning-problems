    "message_2": "The degree of a curve in projective plane is defined as the maximum number of intersections with a generic line. In this case, the curve is given by the equation $f(x, y, z) = x^3 - y^3 - z^3 = 0$. \n\nTo find the degree of the curve, we can consider the intersection of the curve with a generic line in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. A generic line in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ can be represented by the equation $ax + by + cz = 0$, where $a, b, c$ are constants.\n\nSubstituting the line equation into the curve equation, we get:\n\n$a(x^3 - y^3 - z^3) + b(y^3 - x^3 - z^3) + c(z^3 - x^3 - y^3) = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n\n$(a - b + c)x^3 + (b - a + c)y^3 + (c - a - b)z^3 = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the Bezout's theorem, which states that the number of intersection points of two curves in a projective plane is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicities. Since a line has degree 1, the number of intersection points of the curve with the generic line is equal to the degree of the curve.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the equation above is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in the variables $x, y, z$. Therefore, the curve $C$ has degree 3."
