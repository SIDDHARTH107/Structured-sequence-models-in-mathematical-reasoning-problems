The temperature at x=0 and x=8cm is fixed at 100°C, while the temperature at y=0 and y=12cm is fixed at 20°C. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is 1.2 x 10^-5 m^2/s. \n\na) Set up the heat equation with appropriate boundary conditions for this scenario.\nb) Find the steady-state temperature distribution in the metal plate.\nc) Find the temperature distribution in the plate at time t=10 minutes, given that the initial condition is u(x,y,0)=60°C.\nd) At what time t will the temperature at the center of the plate reach 80°C?",
    "message_2": "a) The heat equation for this scenario is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere u(x, y, t) is the temperature at point (x, y) and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the metal.\n\nBoundary conditions:\nu(0, y, t) = 100°C\nu(8, y, t) = 100°C\nu(x, 0, t) = 20°C\nu(x, 12, t) = 20°C\n\nInitial condition:\nu(x, y, 0) = 60°C\n\nb) To find the steady-state temperature distribution, we set ∂u/∂t = 0 and solve the Laplace equation:\n\n∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nWe can use the method of separation of variables to solve this equation. Let u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y), then\n\n(1/X)∂²X/∂x² + (1/Y)∂²Y/∂y² = 0\n\nWe can separate the variables by setting:\n\n(1/X)∂²X/∂x² = -λ\n(1/Y)∂²Y/∂y² = λ\n\nSolving these two ordinary differential equations with the given boundary conditions, we get:\n\nu(x, y) = 60 + (80/π) Σ [(1/n) sin(nπx/8) sinh(nπy/8)] / [sinh(nπ12/8)]\n\nc) To find the temperature distribution at t=10 minutes, we need to solve the heat equation with the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = 60°C. We can use the method of separation of variables and Fourier series to solve this problem. The solution will be in the form:\n\nu(x, y, t) = 60 + Σ [B_n sin(nπx/8) sinh(nπy/8) exp(-n²π²αt/64)]\n\nwhere B_n are the Fourier coefficients. To find B_n, we can use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = 60°C:\n\n60 = 60 + Σ [B_n sin(nπx/8) sinh(nπy/8)]\n\nB_n = (80/π) (1/n) [sinh(nπ12/8)]\n\nNow we can plug in t=10 minutes (600 seconds) to find the temperature distribution:\n\nu(x, y, 600) = 60 + Σ [(80/π) (1/n) sin(nπx/8) sinh(nπy/8) exp(-n²π²α(600)/64)] / [sinh(nπ12/8)]\n\nd) To find the time t when the temperature at the center of the plate (x=4, y=6) reaches 80°C, we can set u(4, 6, t) = 80°C and solve for t:\n\n80 = 60 + Σ [(80/π) (1/n) sin(nπ(4)/8) sinh(nπ(6)/8) exp(-n²π²αt/64)] / [sinh(nπ12/8)]\n\n20 = Σ [(80/π) (1/n) sin(nπ/2) sinh(3nπ/4) exp(-n²π²αt/64)] / [sinh(3nπ/2)]\n\nWe can solve this equation numerically to find the time t when the temperature at the center of the plate reaches 80°C."
