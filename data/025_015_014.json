    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane, we first need to find the gradient of the surface S. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∇S = (dS/dx, dS/dy, dS/dz)\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives:\n\ndS/dx = 6xy\ndS/dy = 3x² - 6y²z\ndS/dz = -2y³ + 1\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the gradient at the point (1, 2, z):\n\n∇S(1, 2, z) = (12, -16z + 3, -16 + 1) = (12, -16z + 3, -15)\n\nTo find the z-coordinate of the point, we plug x = 1 and y = 2 into the equation of the surface:\n\n3(1)²(2) - 2(2)³z + z = 7\n6 - 16z + z = 7\n-15z = 1\nz = -1/15\n\nNow we have the point (1, 2, -1/15) and the gradient at this point is:\n\n∇S(1, 2, -1/15) = (12, -16(-1/15) + 3, -15)\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point (1, 2, -1/15) and (A, B, C) is the gradient (12, 49/15, -15):\n\n12(x - 1) + (49/15)(y - 2) - 15(z + 1/15) = 0\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent plane.\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the normal line. The normal line passes through the point (1, 2, -1/15) and has the direction vector given by the gradient ∇S(1, 2, -1/15) = (12, 49/15, -15). The parametric equations of the normal line are:\n\nx = 1 + 12t\ny = 2 + (49/15)t\nz = -1/15 - 15t\n\nThese are the equations of the tangent plane and the normal line to the surface S at the point (1, 2, -1/15)."
