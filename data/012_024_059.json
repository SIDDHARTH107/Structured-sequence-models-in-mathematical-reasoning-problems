    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 11 and E = 18. We need to find the number of faces (F) to determine if the graph is planar (genus 0) or not.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - 11 + 18\nF = 9\n\nNow we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n18 ≤ 3(11) - 6\n18 ≤ 33 - 6\n18 ≤ 27\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph is planar, and its genus is 0."
