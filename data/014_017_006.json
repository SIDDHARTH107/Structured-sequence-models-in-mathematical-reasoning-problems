    "message_1": "The following is an example of a question for a math student to solve from Cryptography:\n\nQuestion: In a text encrypted using a Caesar Cipher, the most frequent letter of the encrypted message is \"E.\" What shift was used to encrypt the text?\n\nHint: The Caeser Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. The letter \"A\" is shifted to \"B,\" \"B\" is shifted to \"C,\" and so on. A key is used to determine the specific shift.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the shift used in the Caesar Cipher. Since the most frequent letter in the encrypted message is \"E,\" we can assume that \"E\" is the result of shifting the most common letter in the English alphabet, which is \"E\" as well.\n\nLet's denote the shift as \"n\". We need to find the value of \"n\" such that:\n\nE = E + n (mod 26)\n\nSince there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, we use modulo 26 arithmetic. In this case, we can see that:\n\nn = E - E (mod 26)\nn = 0 (mod 26)\n\nSo, the shift used to encrypt the text is 0. This means that the original text was not shifted at all, and the encrypted message is the same as the plaintext message."
