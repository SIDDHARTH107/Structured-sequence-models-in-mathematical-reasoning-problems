    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic function f(x) = -2x^2 + 8x - 5, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = -2 and b = 8.\n\nx = -8 / (2 * -2) = -8 / -4 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the function:\n\nf(2) = -2(2)^2 + 8(2) - 5 = -2(4) + 16 - 5 = -8 + 16 - 5 = 3\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic function is (2, 3).\n\nSince the coefficient of the x^2 term (a) is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward, which means the vertex represents the maximum value of the function. Therefore, the maximum value is 3.\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = 2"
