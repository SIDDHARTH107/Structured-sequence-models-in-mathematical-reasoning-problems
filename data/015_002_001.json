    "message_1": "A pendulum is suspended from the ceiling and is initially displaced by 5 degrees from its equilibrium position. Assume that the motion of the pendulum can be described by the equation: \n\nθ(t) = 5cos(√(g/l)t)  \n\nwhere θ(t) is the angle of the pendulum in degrees and t is time in seconds. Use the butterfly effect to determine the maximum angle displacement of the pendulum if the initial displacement is changed to 5.1 degrees.",
    "message_2": "The butterfly effect is a concept in chaos theory that suggests that small changes in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in outcomes. In this case, we are asked to find the maximum angle displacement of the pendulum when the initial displacement is changed from 5 degrees to 5.1 degrees.\n\nThe equation for the motion of the pendulum is given by:\n\nθ(t) = 5cos(√(g/l)t)\n\nWhen the initial displacement is changed to 5.1 degrees, the new equation for the motion of the pendulum becomes:\n\nθ'(t) = 5.1cos(√(g/l)t)\n\nTo find the maximum angle displacement, we need to find the maximum value of θ'(t). Since the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, the maximum value of the cosine function is 1. Therefore, the maximum angle displacement occurs when cos(√(g/l)t) = 1.\n\nSo, the maximum angle displacement for the new initial condition is:\n\nθ'(t) = 5.1cos(√(g/l)t) = 5.1 * 1 = 5.1 degrees\n\nThus, when the initial displacement is changed to 5.1 degrees, the maximum angle displacement of the pendulum is 5.1 degrees."
