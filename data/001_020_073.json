    "message_2": "To find the vertex, x-intercept, and y-intercept of the absolute value equation y = |2x + 3|, we'll first need to analyze the equation.\n\nVertex:\nThe vertex of an absolute value equation is the point where the graph changes direction. In this case, the graph changes direction when the expression inside the absolute value (2x + 3) is equal to 0. To find the x-coordinate of the vertex, we'll set the expression inside the absolute value equal to 0:\n\n2x + 3 = 0\n2x = -3\nx = -3/2\n\nNow, we'll plug this x-coordinate back into the equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex:\n\ny = |2(-3/2) + 3|\ny = |-3 + 3|\ny = |0|\ny = 0\n\nSo, the vertex of the equation is (-3/2, 0).\n\nX-intercept:\nThe x-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the x-axis, which means the y-coordinate is 0. Since we already found the vertex, which has a y-coordinate of 0, we know that the x-intercept is the same as the vertex. Thus, the x-intercept is (-3/2, 0).\n\nY-intercept:\nThe y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis, which means the x-coordinate is 0. We'll plug in x = 0 into the equation to find the y-coordinate:\n\ny = |2(0) + 3|\ny = |3|\ny = 3\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 3).\n\nIn summary, the vertex is (-3/2, 0), the x-intercept is (-3/2, 0), and the y-intercept is (0, 3)."
