    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of the sector, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the lengths of the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * π * radius\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 10 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60 / 360) * 2 * π * 10\nArc length = (1/6) * 20π\nArc length = 10π/3 inches\n\nNow, let's add the lengths of the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + radius + radius\nPerimeter = (10π/3) + 10 + 10\nPerimeter = 10π/3 + 20 inches"
