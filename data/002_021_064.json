    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360°) × π × radius²\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 7 cm and the central angle is 60°, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (60° / 360°) × π × 7²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 49\n\nArea of sector = 49π/6\n\nThe area of the sector is (49π/6) square centimeters."
