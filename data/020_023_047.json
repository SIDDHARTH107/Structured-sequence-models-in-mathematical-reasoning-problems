    "message_2": "To find the optimal proportion of investment to allocate to each stock, we need to create a portfolio with a maximum standard deviation of 12% while maximizing the expected return. Let's denote the proportion of investment in Stock A, B, and C as w_A, w_B, and w_C, respectively. Since we are investing in three stocks, the sum of the proportions should equal 1:\n\nw_A + w_B + w_C = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by:\n\nE(R_portfolio) = w_A * E(R_A) + w_B * E(R_B) + w_C * E(R_C)\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio is given by:\n\nσ_portfolio = √[ (w_A * σ_A)^2 + (w_B * σ_B)^2 + (w_C * σ_C)^2 + 2 * w_A * w_B * σ_A * σ_B * Corr(A,B) + 2 * w_A * w_C * σ_A * σ_C * Corr(A,C) + 2 * w_B * w_C * σ_B * σ_C * Corr(B,C) ]\n\nWe want to maximize the expected return while keeping the standard deviation at or below 12%. This is an optimization problem that can be solved using numerical methods, such as the Lagrange multiplier method or quadratic programming.\n\nFor this problem, we will use the Lagrange multiplier method. First, we will set up the Lagrangian function:\n\nL(w_A, w_B, w_C, λ) = E(R_portfolio) - λ * (σ_portfolio^2 - 0.12^2)\n\nNow, we will take the partial derivatives of L with respect to w_A, w_B, w_C, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂w_A = E(R_A) - λ * (2 * w_A * σ_A^2 + 2 * w_B * σ_A * σ_B * Corr(A,B) + 2 * w_C * σ_A * σ_C * Corr(A,C)) = 0\n∂L/∂w_B = E(R_B) - λ * (2 * w_A * σ_A * σ_B * Corr(A,B) + 2 * w_B * σ_B^2 + 2 * w_C * σ_B * σ_C * Corr(B,C)) = 0\n∂L/∂w_C = E(R_C) - λ * (2 * w_A * σ_A * σ_C * Corr(A,C) + 2 * w_B * σ_B * σ_C * Corr(B,C) + 2 * w_C * σ_C^2) = 0\n∂L/∂λ = σ_portfolio^2 - 0.12^2 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations numerically, we get the optimal proportions:\n\nw_A ≈ 0.338\nw_B ≈ 0.481\nw_C ≈ 0.181\n\nSo, the optimal proportion of your investment to allocate to each stock is approximately 33.8% in Stock A, 48.1% in Stock B, and 18.1% in Stock C."
