    "message_2": "There are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. However, writing down the multiplication tables for all 51 groups would be an extremely lengthy task. Instead, I will provide a brief description of each group and a general idea of their structure.\n\n1. C32: The cyclic group of order 32.\n2. C16 x C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. C8 x C4: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n4. C4 x C4 x C2: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n5. C2 x C2 x C2 x C2 x C2: The direct product of five cyclic groups of order 2.\n6-9. Four distinct groups of order 32 with a cyclic group of order 8 as a normal subgroup.\n10-13. Four distinct groups of order 32 with a cyclic group of order 4 as a normal subgroup.\n14-17. Four distinct groups of order 32 with a cyclic group of order 2 as a normal subgroup.\n18-19. Two distinct groups of order 32 with a dihedral group of order 16 as a normal subgroup.\n20-21. Two distinct groups of order 32 with a quaternion group of order 8 as a normal subgroup.\n22-23. Two distinct groups of order 32 with a dihedral group of order 8 as a normal subgroup.\n24-25. Two distinct groups of order 32 with a quaternion group of order 4 as a normal subgroup.\n26-29. Four distinct groups of order 32 with a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n30-33. Four distinct groups of order 32 with a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n34-37. Four distinct groups of order 32 with a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n38-41. Four distinct groups of order 32 with a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n42-45. Four distinct groups of order 32 with a semidirect product of a dihedral group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n46-47. Two distinct groups of order 32 with a semidirect product of a quaternion group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n48-49. Two distinct groups of order 32 with a semidirect product of a dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n50-51. Two distinct groups of order 32 with a semidirect product of a quaternion group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation and representation of these groups, I recommend consulting a group theory textbook or online resources dedicated to the classification of finite groups."
