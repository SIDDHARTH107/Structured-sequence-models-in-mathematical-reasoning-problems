    "message_1": "A basketball player makes 70% of their free throws. If they take 10 free throws in a game, what is the probability that they make all 10 free throws?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the basketball player making all 10 free throws, we need to multiply the probability of making each individual free throw together. Since the player makes 70% of their free throws, the probability of making each free throw is 0.7.\n\nSo, the probability of making all 10 free throws is:\n\n0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.7^10 â‰ˆ 0.0282\n\nThe probability of the basketball player making all 10 free throws is approximately 2.82%."
