    "message_2": "The mean curvature H of a cylinder can be found using the formula:\n\nH = (1/R1 + 1/R2) / 2\n\nwhere R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature. For a cylinder, one of the principal curvatures is always 0, since there is no curvature along the height of the cylinder. The other principal curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of the cylinder, which in this case is 5.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nH = (1/5 + 0) / 2\nH = (1/5) / 2\nH = 1/10\n\nThe mean curvature at a point on the surface located 3 units above the base edge of the cylinder is 1/10."
