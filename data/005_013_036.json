The company collected data on advertising spending (in thousands of dollars) and sales (in millions of dollars) for each product over a period of 6 months. \n\nThe data is as follows:\n\nProduct A: \nAdvertising spending: 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27\nSales: 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 60\n\nProduct B: \nAdvertising spending: 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28\nSales: 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50\n\nProduct C: \nAdvertising spending: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35\nSales: 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75\n\nWhat is the correlation coefficient between advertising spending and sales for each product, and what does it indicate about the relationship between the two variables?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) for each product, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = [ n * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy ] / sqrt( [ n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2 ] * [ n * Σ(y^2) - (Σy)^2 ] )\n\nwhere n is the number of data points, Σ(xy) is the sum of the product of corresponding x and y values, Σx and Σy are the sum of x and y values, and Σ(x^2) and Σ(y^2) are the sum of the squares of x and y values.\n\nProduct A:\nn = 6\nΣx = 117\nΣy = 275\nΣ(xy) = 7020\nΣ(x^2) = 2259\nΣ(y^2) = 16775\n\nr_A = [ 6 * 7020 - 117 * 275 ] / sqrt( [ 6 * 2259 - 117^2 ] * [ 6 * 16775 - 275^2 ] )\nr_A = 0.997\n\nProduct B:\nn = 6\nΣx = 108\nΣy = 220\nΣ(xy) = 5280\nΣ(x^2) = 2040\nΣ(y^2) = 11050\n\nr_B = [ 6 * 5280 - 108 * 220 ] / sqrt( [ 6 * 2040 - 108^2 ] * [ 6 * 11050 - 220^2 ] )\nr_B = 0.985\n\nProduct C:\nn = 6\nΣx = 135\nΣy = 300\nΣ(xy) = 9450\nΣ(x^2) = 2925\nΣ(y^2) = 22750\n\nr_C = [ 6 * 9450 - 135 * 300 ] / sqrt( [ 6 * 2925 - 135^2 ] * [ 6 * 22750 - 300^2 ] )\nr_C = 0.999\n\nThe correlation coefficients for each product are as follows:\nProduct A: r = 0.997\nProduct B: r = 0.985\nProduct C: r = 0.999\n\nThese values indicate a very strong positive relationship between advertising spending and sales for all three products. As advertising spending increases, sales also increase for each product. The correlation coefficients are very close to 1, which indicates a near-perfect linear relationship between the two variables."
