    "message_2": "Let's denote the length and width of the rectangular cardboard as L and W, respectively. In this case, L = 16 cm and W = 10 cm. When we cut a square of side length x from each corner and fold the cardboard, the dimensions of the resulting open box will be:\n\nLength = L - 2x = 16 - 2x\nWidth = W - 2x = 10 - 2x\nHeight = x\n\nThe volume V of the open box can be calculated as the product of its length, width, and height:\n\nV(x) = (16 - 2x)(10 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum possible volume of the box, we need to find the maximum value of V(x). To do this, we can find the critical points of the function V(x) by taking its first derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (16 - 2x)(-4x) + (10 - 2x)(-2x) + x(-4x - 4x)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nV'(x) = -8x^2 + 32x - 4x^2 + 20x + 8x^2\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nV'(x) = -4x^2 + 52x\n\nNow, set V'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = -4x^2 + 52x\n0 = 4x(13 - x)\n\nThis gives us two critical points: x = 0 and x = 13. However, x = 0 corresponds to the case where no squares are cut from the corners, and x = 13 is not possible since it is greater than half of the smaller side of the cardboard (10/2 = 5). Thus, we need to find the maximum volume in the interval 0 < x < 5.\n\nSince V'(x) is a continuous function, we can use the first derivative test to determine the maximum volume. We know that V'(x) changes sign from positive to negative at x = 13, so there must be a local maximum at x = 13. Since this is the only critical point in the interval 0 < x < 5, it must be the global maximum.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum volume by plugging x = 13 back into the volume function:\n\nV(13) = (16 - 2(13))(10 - 2(13))(13)\nV(13) = (16 - 26)(10 - 26)(13)\nV(13) = (-10)(-16)(13)\n\nThe maximum possible volume of the resulting box is 2080 cubic centimeters."
