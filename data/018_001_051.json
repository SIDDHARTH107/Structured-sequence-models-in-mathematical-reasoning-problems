    "message_2": "To determine whether the empty set ∅ is a subset of set X, we need to use the definition of a subset. A set A is a subset of a set B (denoted as A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also an element of B.\n\nIn this case, set X = {2, 4, 6, 8} and set A = ∅ (the empty set). The empty set has no elements, so there are no elements in A that are not in X. Therefore, by definition, the empty set ∅ is a subset of set X.\n\nIn general, the empty set is a subset of any set, including itself."
