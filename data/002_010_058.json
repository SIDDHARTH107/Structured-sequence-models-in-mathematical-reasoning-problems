    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular polygon, we simply multiply the length of one side by the number of sides. In this case, the polygon has 9 sides, each measuring 5 cm. So, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = (Number of sides) × (Length of one side)\nPerimeter = 9 × 5 cm\nPerimeter = 45 cm\n\nThe perimeter of this regular polygon is 45 cm."
