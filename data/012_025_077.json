    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph.\n\nWe can start at vertex 1 and follow the edges in this order: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,1). This cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex 1.\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian cycle in the graph is: 1-2-3-4-5-6-1."
