    "message_1": "In a restaurant, the menu has 8 main dishes, and a customer can choose up to 3 dishes. How many different ways can a customer select their meal from the menu? Use the Bell numbers formula to calculate the answer.",
    "message_2": "The Bell numbers formula is not the appropriate method for solving this problem. Instead, we can use combinations to find the number of ways a customer can select their meal from the menu.\n\nThere are three cases to consider:\n\n1. The customer chooses only 1 dish.\n2. The customer chooses 2 dishes.\n3. The customer chooses 3 dishes.\n\nFor case 1, there are 8 ways to choose 1 dish from 8 (8C1).\n\nFor case 2, there are 8C2 ways to choose 2 dishes from 8.\n\nFor case 3, there are 8C3 ways to choose 3 dishes from 8.\n\nSo, the total number of ways a customer can select their meal is:\n\n8C1 + 8C2 + 8C3 = 8 + 28 + 56 = 92\n\nTherefore, there are 92 different ways a customer can select their meal from the menu."
