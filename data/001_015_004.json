    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation $16\\cdot2^x = 64$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by 16:\n$$2^x = \\frac{64}{16}$$\n\n2. Simplify the right side of the equation:\n$$2^x = 4$$\n\n3. Since $4$ can be written as $2^2$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$2^x = 2^2$$\n\n4. Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n$$x = 2$$\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation $16\\cdot2^x = 64$ is $x = 2$."
