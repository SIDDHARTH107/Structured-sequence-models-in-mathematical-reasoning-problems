How many ways are there to distribute a prize to each worker if the factory management wants to reward at least one worker? Use Bell numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to partition the set of 10 workers into non-empty subsets, where each subset represents a group of workers receiving a prize.\n\nThe Bell numbers can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = Î£ (from k=0 to n-1) C(n-1, k) * B(k)\n\nwhere B(n) is the nth Bell number, and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient (n choose k).\n\nThe first few Bell numbers are:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\nB(6) = 203\nB(7) = 877\nB(8) = 4140\nB(9) = 21147\nB(10) = 115975\n\nSo, there are 115975 ways to distribute a prize to the 10 workers, with at least one worker receiving a prize."
