    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem: \n\nA population of rabbits undergoes exponential growth and is described by the equation:\n\n      dP/dt = kP - aP^2\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, k = 0.5 is the growth rate, and a = 0.05 is the carrying capacity. Suppose there are initially 100 rabbits.\n\nFind the maximum population size and the time at which it occurs.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum population size, we need to find the equilibrium points of the given equation. Equilibrium points occur when the population growth rate (dP/dt) is equal to zero. So, we set dP/dt = 0 and solve for P:\n\n0 = kP - aP^2\n\nNow, we can factor out P:\n\n0 = P(k - aP)\n\nThis gives us two equilibrium points:\n\n1) P = 0 (which corresponds to no rabbits, so it's not relevant in this context)\n2) k - aP = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for P in the second equilibrium point:\n\naP = k\nP = k/a\n\nSubstitute the given values of k and a:\n\nP = 0.5/0.05\nP = 10\n\nSo, the maximum population size is 10 rabbits.\n\nNow, to find the time at which this maximum population size occurs, we need to solve the given differential equation. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndP/dt = kP(1 - aP)\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can separate the variables and integrate:\n\n∫(1/(P(1 - aP))) dP = ∫k dt\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides:\n\nln|P/(1 - aP)| = kt + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition P(0) = 100:\n\nln|100/(1 - 0.05*100)| = 0.5*0 + C\nln|100/(-4)| = C\nC = ln|25|\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation with the constant C:\n\nln|P/(1 - aP)| = kt + ln|25|\n\nTo find the time at which the maximum population size occurs (P = 10), we can substitute P = 10 and solve for t:\n\nln|10/(1 - 0.05*10)| = 0.5t + ln|25|\nln|10/(-4)| = 0.5t + ln|25|\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nln|2.5| = 0.5t\nt = 2*ln|2.5|\n\nSo, the maximum population size of 10 rabbits occurs at t = 2*ln|2.5| units of time."
