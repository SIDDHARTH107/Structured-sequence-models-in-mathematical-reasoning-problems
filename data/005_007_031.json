    "message_1": "What is the correlation coefficient between the final exam scores and the midterm exam scores of a statistics class if the final exam scores have a mean of 80, a standard deviation of 8, and a sample size of 30, while the midterm exam scores have a mean of 75, a standard deviation of 5, and a sample size of 30 as well.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient between the final exam scores and the midterm exam scores, we need the covariance between the two sets of scores. Unfortunately, the information provided does not include the covariance or the individual scores to calculate it. \n\nPlease provide the covariance or the individual scores for both the final exam and midterm exam, and then we can calculate the correlation coefficient."
