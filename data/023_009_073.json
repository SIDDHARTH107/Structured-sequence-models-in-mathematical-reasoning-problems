What is the fundamental frequency of transverse vibrations of the beam? Use the Fourier transform method to solve the boundary value problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental frequency of transverse vibrations of the beam, we can use the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. The equation is given by:\n\nEI * (d^4w/dx^4) = -ρA * (d^2w/dt^2)\n\nwhere E is the Young's modulus, I is the area moment of inertia, ρ is the density of the material, A is the cross-sectional area, and w is the transverse displacement of the beam.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area moment of inertia (I) for the beam. Assuming the cross-sectional shape of the beam is a rectangle, the area moment of inertia can be calculated as:\n\nI = (b * h^3) / 12\n\nwhere b is the width and h is the height of the rectangle. Since the cross-sectional area (A) is 2 square meters, let's assume the width (b) is 1 meter and the height (h) is 2 meters. Then, the area moment of inertia (I) is:\n\nI = (1 * 2^3) / 12 = 8 / 12 = 2/3 m^4\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform method to solve the boundary value problem. The general solution of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation can be written as:\n\nw(x, t) = Σ [A_n * sin(n * π * x / L) * cos(ω_n * t)]\n\nwhere A_n is the amplitude of the nth mode, L is the length of the beam, ω_n is the angular frequency of the nth mode, and n is the mode number.\n\nFor the fundamental frequency (n = 1), the boundary conditions are:\n\nw(0, t) = 0\nw(L, t) = 0\n(d^2w/dx^2)(0, t) = 0\n(d^2w/dx^2)(L, t) = 0\n\nApplying these boundary conditions, we get:\n\nA_1 * sin(π * x / L) * cos(ω_1 * t) = 0\n\nSince sin(π * x / L) is nonzero, we can divide both sides by it:\n\nA_1 * cos(ω_1 * t) = 0\n\nThis implies that A_1 is nonzero, and we can divide both sides by A_1:\n\ncos(ω_1 * t) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the angular frequency (ω_1) of the fundamental mode using the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation:\n\nω_1^2 = (EI * (π / L)^4) / (ρA)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nω_1^2 = (200 * 10^9 * (2/3) * (π / 10)^4) / (ρ * 2)\n\nAssuming the density of steel (ρ) is 7850 kg/m^3, we get:\n\nω_1^2 = (200 * 10^9 * (2/3) * (π / 10)^4) / (7850 * 2)\n\nω_1^2 ≈ 1.61 * 10^6\n\nω_1 ≈ 1269.3 rad/s\n\nFinally, we can find the fundamental frequency (f_1) using the relation:\n\nf_1 = ω_1 / (2 * π)\n\nf_1 ≈ 1269.3 / (2 * π) ≈ 202 Hz\n\nSo, the fundamental frequency of transverse vibrations of the beam is approximately 202 Hz."
