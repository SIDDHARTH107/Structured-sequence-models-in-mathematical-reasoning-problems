    "message_2": "To prove that the order of the identity element e in the group G is 1, we need to show that e^1 = e.\n\nRecall the definition of the order of an element in a group: The order of an element g in a group G is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group.\n\nSince e is the identity element of the group G, it has the property that for any element g in G, e * g = g * e = g. In particular, this means that e^1 = e * e = e.\n\nTherefore, the order of the identity element e in the group G is 1, as desired."
