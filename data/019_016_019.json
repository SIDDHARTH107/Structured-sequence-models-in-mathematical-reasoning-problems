    "message_2": "To determine the union and intersection of sets A and B, we need to find the elements that are in either set (union) and the elements that are in both sets (intersection).\n\nUnion of sets A and B (A ∪ B) is the set containing all elements that are in either set A or set B or in both. In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nIntersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B) is the set containing all elements that are common to both set A and set B. In this case, A ∩ B = {2, 3}.\n\nSo, the union of sets A and B is {1, 2, 3, 4}, and the intersection of sets A and B is {2, 3}."
