    "message_2": "The arctan function, also known as the inverse tangent function, returns the angle whose tangent is the given value. In this case, we want to find the angle whose tangent is sqrt(3).\n\nRecall that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. We can use the special right triangles to find the angle whose tangent is sqrt(3).\n\nConsider the 30-60-90 special right triangle, where the side lengths are in the ratio 1:√3:2. In this triangle, the side opposite the 60-degree angle has length √3, and the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle has length 1. Therefore, the tangent of the 60-degree angle is:\n\ntan(60°) = (√3) / 1 = √3\n\nSince the tangent of the 60-degree angle is equal to √3, the arctan(√3) is:\n\narctan(√3) = 60° (in degrees) or π/3 (in radians)"
