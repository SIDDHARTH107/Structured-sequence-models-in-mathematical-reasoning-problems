    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, we will analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 16, which is a power of a prime (16 = 2^4), G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 2 and divides the order of G. The only possibility for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 1. Thus, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which we will denote as H.\n\nSince H is the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G, it is normal in G. The order of H is 2^3 = 8, so H is a group of order 8. Now, we will analyze the structure of H.\n\nThere are three possibilities for the structure of H:\n\n1. H is isomorphic to C8, the cyclic group of order 8.\n2. H is isomorphic to C4 x C2, the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 2.\n3. H is isomorphic to D4, the dihedral group of order 8.\n\nWe will now analyze each of these possibilities and determine the structure of G based on the structure of H.\n\n1. If H is isomorphic to C8, then G has an element of order 8. Since the order of G is 16, G must also have an element of order 2. Let a be an element of order 8 and b be an element of order 2 in G. Then G is generated by a and b, and we can write any element of G as a^i * b^j for 0 ≤ i ≤ 7 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 1. Since H is normal in G, we have b * a * b^(-1) = a^k for some integer k. Since a has order 8, we must have k = 1 or k = 7. If k = 1, then G is abelian and isomorphic to C16. If k = 7, then G is non-abelian and isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\n2. If H is isomorphic to C4 x C2, then G has elements of orders 4 and 2. Let a be an element of order 4 and b be an element of order 2 in G. Then G is generated by a and b, and we can write any element of G as a^i * b^j for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 1. Since H is normal in G, we have b * a * b^(-1) = a^k for some integer k. Since a has order 4, we must have k = 1 or k = 3. If k = 1, then G is abelian and isomorphic to C4 x C4. If k = 3, then G is non-abelian and isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\n3. If H is isomorphic to D4, then G has elements of orders 4 and 2. Let a be an element of order 4 and b be an element of order 2 in G. Then G is generated by a and b, and we can write any element of G as a^i * b^j for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 1. Since H is normal in G, we have b * a * b^(-1) = a^k for some integer k. Since a has order 4, we must have k = 1 or k = 3. If k = 1, then G is abelian and isomorphic to D4 x C2. If k = 3, then G is non-abelian and isomorphic to D8.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16 depending on the structure of its unique Sylow 2-subgroup H. To determine the specific isomorphism, one would need more information about the group G."
