    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order p is cyclic, we will use the fact that a group of order p is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_p (the integers modulo p). We will show that a group of order 5 is cyclic by finding the generator(s) of a group of order 5.\n\nLet G be a group of order 5, and let g be an element of G. Since G has 5 elements, the possible orders of g are divisors of 5, which are 1 and 5. If the order of g is 1, then g is the identity element of G. If the order of g is 5, then g generates G, and G is cyclic.\n\nNow, let's find the generator(s) of a group of order 5. We will use the cyclic group Z_5 (the integers modulo 5) as an example. The elements of Z_5 are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. We will find the generators by checking the powers of each element:\n\n1. 1^1 ≡ 1 (mod 5), 1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 5), 1^3 ≡ 1 (mod 5), 1^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5), 1^5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. 2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 5), 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 5), 2^3 ≡ 3 (mod 5), 2^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n3. 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 5), 3^2 ≡ 4 (mod 5), 3^3 ≡ 2 (mod 5), 3^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n4. 4^1 ≡ 4 (mod 5), 4^2 ≡ 1 (mod 5), 4^3 ≡ 4 (mod 5), 4^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFrom the calculations above, we can see that the elements 2 and 3 generate the entire group Z_5, as their powers produce all the elements of the group. Therefore, the generators of a group of order 5 are 2 and 3, and the group is cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order p (in this case, p = 5) is cyclic, and we have found the generators of a group of order 5. This result can be generalized to any prime number p."
