    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle in degrees / 360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 6 meters, and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) * π * 6^2\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) * π * 36\n\nArea of sector = 6π square meters\n\nSo, the area of the sector is 6π square meters."
