    "message_2": "To find the wave function in momentum space, we need to calculate the Fourier transform of the given wave function ψ(x). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫ f(x) e^(-ikx) dx\n\nIn our case, f(x) = ψ(x) = (1/π)^(1/4) (1 - x^2) e^(-x^2 / 2). So, we need to calculate the Fourier transform of this function:\n\nψ(p) = (1/√(2π)) ∫ [(1/π)^(1/4) (1 - x^2) e^(-x^2 / 2)] e^(-ipx) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = (1 - x^2) and dv = e^(-x^2 / 2) e^(-ipx) dx. Then, du = -2x dx and v = ∫ e^(-x^2 / 2) e^(-ipx) dx.\n\nThe integral ∫ e^(-x^2 / 2) e^(-ipx) dx is a Gaussian integral, which can be solved using the error function (erf). However, the integral is quite complicated and does not have a simple closed-form solution. Therefore, we will not be able to find an exact expression for ψ(p).\n\nTo find the standard deviation of the momentum, we need to calculate the expectation value of p^2 and then take the square root of the result. The expectation value of an operator O is given by:\n\n⟨O⟩ = ∫ ψ*(x) O ψ(x) dx\n\nIn our case, O = p^2, and ψ*(x) = (1/π)^(1/4) (1 - x^2) e^(-x^2 / 2). So, we need to calculate the following integral:\n\n⟨p^2⟩ = ∫ [(1/π)^(1/4) (1 - x^2) e^(-x^2 / 2)] p^2 [(1/π)^(1/4) (1 - x^2) e^(-x^2 / 2)] dx\n\nAgain, this integral is quite complicated and does not have a simple closed-form solution. Therefore, we will not be able to find an exact expression for the standard deviation of the momentum.\n\nIn summary, the Fourier transform of the given wave function is quite complicated and does not have a simple closed-form solution. Consequently, we cannot find an exact expression for the standard deviation of the momentum."
