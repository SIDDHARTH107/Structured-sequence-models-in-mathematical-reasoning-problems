    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the partition function: P(3) = 3, P(1) = 1, P(1) = 1. There are 3 * 1 * 1 = 3 abelian groups of order 120.\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: gcd(n, φ(n)) = gcd(120, 32) = 8. There are 8 possible non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\nHowever, this formula includes abelian groups, so we need to subtract the number of abelian groups from the total: 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 120."
