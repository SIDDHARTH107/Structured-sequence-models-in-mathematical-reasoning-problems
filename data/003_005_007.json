    "message_2": "To find the value of θ in degrees using inverse trigonometric functions, we can use the arcsin (or sin^(-1)) function. \n\nsin^(-1)(0.5) = θ\n\nUsing a calculator or a table of trigonometric values, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 30°\n\nHowever, since the sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants, there is another angle in the second quadrant that also has a sine value of 0.5. To find this angle, we can subtract the angle we found from 180°:\n\n180° - 30° = 150°\n\nSo, there are two possible values for θ:\n\nθ ≈ 30° or θ ≈ 150°"
