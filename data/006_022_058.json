What is the probability that out of 100 randomly selected students, exactly 30 will receive an A grade in Mathematics?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (A grades) in n trials (students)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (A grade) for a single trial (student)\n- n is the number of trials (students)\n- k is the number of successes (A grades)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 100 (number of randomly selected students)\n- k = 30 (number of students with an A grade)\n- p = 0.25 (probability of a student receiving an A grade)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k) = C(100, 30). This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\nC(100, 30) = 100! / (30! * 70!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 30) = C(100, 30) * 0.25^30 * (1-0.25)^(100-30)\nP(X = 30) = C(100, 30) * 0.25^30 * 0.75^70\n\nAfter calculating the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 30) â‰ˆ 0.0863\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 30 out of 100 randomly selected students will receive an A grade in Mathematics is approximately 8.63%."
