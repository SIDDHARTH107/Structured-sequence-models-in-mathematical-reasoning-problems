    "message_2": "To solve for x, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 5 to both sides of the equation.\n4x - 5 + 5 = 11 + 5\n\nStep 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.\n4x = 16\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 4.\n4x / 4 = 16 / 4\n\nStep 4: Simplify both sides of the equation.\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solution is x = 4."
