    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover for a given graph.\n\nTo find the minimum size of the vertex cover for graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges, we can use the fact that the size of the minimum vertex cover is at least the number of edges divided by the maximum degree of the graph (Δ).\n\nIn this case, we know that G has 9 edges. The maximum degree of a simple graph with 7 vertices is 6 (each vertex can be connected to every other vertex). However, if the maximum degree is 6, then the graph would have more than 9 edges, which is not the case here. So, the maximum degree must be less than 6.\n\nLet's consider the case where the maximum degree is 5. In this case, the graph would have at least 5 * 7 / 2 = 17.5 edges, which is also not possible. So, the maximum degree must be less than 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the maximum degree is 4. In this case, the graph would have at least 4 * 7 / 2 = 14 edges, which is still not possible. So, the maximum degree must be less than 4.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where the maximum degree is 3. In this case, the graph would have at least 3 * 7 / 2 = 10.5 edges, which is more than 9 edges. However, since we are looking for the minimum size of the vertex cover, we can use the fact that the size of the minimum vertex cover is at least the number of edges divided by the maximum degree of the graph (Δ).\n\nSo, the minimum size of the vertex cover for graph G is at least 9 / 3 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph is 3."
