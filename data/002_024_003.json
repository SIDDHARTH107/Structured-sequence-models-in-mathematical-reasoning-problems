    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply add the lengths of all four sides.\n\nPerimeter = length of first base + length of second base + length of first non-parallel side + length of second non-parallel side\n\nPerimeter = 8 cm + 14 cm + 5 cm + 9 cm\n\nPerimeter = 36 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 36 cm."
