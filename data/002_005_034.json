    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has dimensions of length 8 cm, width 6 cm, and height 10 cm. What is the length of its longest diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the longest diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the three sides (l, w, and h).\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nIn this case, the length (l) is 8 cm, the width (w) is 6 cm, and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nd^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 + 10^2\nd^2 = 64 + 36 + 100\nd^2 = 200\n\nNow, to find the length of the diagonal (d), we take the square root of 200:\n\nd = √200\nd ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.14 cm."
