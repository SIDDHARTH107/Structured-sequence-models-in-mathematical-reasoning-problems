    "message_2": "A cut vertex (articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 8 vertices. A tree is a connected graph with the minimum number of edges, and for a tree with n vertices, there are (n-1) edges. So, for a tree with 8 vertices, there would be 7 edges.\n\nOur graph has 10 edges, which is 3 more than the minimum required for a connected graph with 8 vertices. This means that there must be at least one cycle in the graph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the cut vertices and bridges:\n\n1. If a vertex is part of a cycle, its removal will not increase the number of connected components, so it cannot be a cut vertex.\n\n2. If an edge is part of a cycle, its removal will not increase the number of connected components, so it cannot be a bridge.\n\nSince our graph has at least one cycle, we can conclude that there are fewer cut vertices and bridges than in a tree with 8 vertices.\n\nIn a tree with 8 vertices, there are 7 edges, and each edge is a bridge. However, our graph has 10 edges, so there must be at least one edge that is not a bridge. Therefore, the number of bridges in the graph is less than 7.\n\nIn a tree with 8 vertices, there can be at most 7 cut vertices (one for each non-leaf vertex). However, our graph has at least one cycle, so there must be at least one vertex that is not a cut vertex. Therefore, the number of cut vertices in the graph is less than 7.\n\nWe cannot determine the exact number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph without more information about the graph's structure. However, we can conclude that there are fewer than 7 cut vertices and fewer than 7 bridges in the graph."
