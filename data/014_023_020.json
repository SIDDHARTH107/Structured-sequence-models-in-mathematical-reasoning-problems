    "message_2": "First, let's encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Rail fence cipher with 4 rows.\n\n1. Write the message in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows:\n\nM   E   A   S\n A T M T I C\n  T   H   M\n   I   C\n\n2. Read the message row by row:\n\nMEASATMTICTHMIC\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"MEASATMTICTHMIC\".\n\nNow, let's decrypt the encrypted message \"AAHHESITTMCMA\" back to its original form.\n\n1. Determine the length of each row:\n\nRow 1: 3 characters\nRow 2: 4 characters\nRow 3: 3 characters\nRow 4: 2 characters\n\n2. Write the encrypted message in the same zigzag pattern:\n\nA   H   E\n A H S I T\n  T   M   C\n   M   A\n\n3. Read the message diagonally:\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"MATHEMATICS\"."
