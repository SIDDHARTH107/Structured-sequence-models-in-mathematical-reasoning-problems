    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of Mary's winnings, we need to consider the probabilities of each outcome and the corresponding winnings.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes: Mary picks correctly (heads or tails) or Mary picks incorrectly. Since the coin is fair, the probability of each outcome is 0.5.\n\nIf Mary picks correctly, she wins $10. If she picks incorrectly, she loses $5.\n\nThe expected value (EV) is calculated as follows:\n\nEV = (probability of winning) × (amount won) + (probability of losing) × (amount lost)\nEV = (0.5) × ($10) + (0.5) × (-$5)\nEV = $5 + (-$2.50)\nEV = $2.50\n\nSo, the expected value of Mary's winnings from one game is $2.50."
