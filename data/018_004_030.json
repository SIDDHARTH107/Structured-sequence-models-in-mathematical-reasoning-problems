That is, find the complement of set A and show that this is the only set that satisfies the definition of a complement of A.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A in the universal set U, we need to find all the elements in U that are not in A. The complement of A is denoted as A'.\n\nA' = U - A\n\nA' = {1,2,3,4,5,6} - {1,2,3}\n\nA' = {4,5,6}\n\nNow, let's prove that this complement is unique. Suppose there is another set A'' that is also a complement of A in U. By definition, A'' must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. A'' ∩ A = Ø (A'' and A have no elements in common)\n2. A'' ∪ A = U (A'' and A together contain all elements of U)\n\nSince A' is the complement of A, it satisfies these conditions:\n\n1. A' ∩ A = {4,5,6} ∩ {1,2,3} = Ø\n2. A' ∪ A = {4,5,6} ∪ {1,2,3} = {1,2,3,4,5,6} = U\n\nNow, let's check if A'' satisfies these conditions:\n\n1. A'' ∩ A = Ø (by definition)\n2. A'' ∪ A = U (by definition)\n\nSince A'' ∪ A = U and A' ∪ A = U, we can say that A'' ∪ A = A' ∪ A. This means that A'' and A' contain the same elements when combined with A. Since both A'' and A' have no elements in common with A (A'' ∩ A = Ø and A' ∩ A = Ø), we can conclude that A'' and A' must be the same set.\n\nTherefore, the complement of set A in the universal set U is unique, and it is A' = {4,5,6}."
