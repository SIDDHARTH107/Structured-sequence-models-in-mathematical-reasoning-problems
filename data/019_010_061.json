    "message_2": "In linear logic, the symbols ⊗ and ⊸ have different meanings than in standard mathematics. The ⊗ symbol represents the \"tensor\" or \"multiplicative conjunction,\" and the ⊸ symbol represents the \"linear implication\" or \"multiplicative implication.\" These symbols are used to represent relationships between resources or propositions rather than numerical operations.\n\nTo evaluate the expression (3 ⊗ 4) ⊸ 5 in linear logic, we need to interpret the numbers as resources or propositions. However, without any context or specific interpretation for these numbers, it is not possible to provide a meaningful result for this expression in linear logic."
