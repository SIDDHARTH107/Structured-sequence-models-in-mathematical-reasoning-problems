    "message_2": "To find the points where the surface has vertical tangents, we need to find the critical points of the equation. We'll do this by finding the gradient of the surface and setting it equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 6x\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 6x = 0\n3y^2 = 0\n\nLet's solve the first equation for x:\n\n3x^2 - 6x = 0\n3x(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 or x = 2.\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation for y:\n\n3y^2 = 0\ny^2 = 0\n\nSo, y = 0.\n\nNow, we have the critical points (x, y) = (0, 0) and (2, 0). Let's plug these points back into the original equation to find the corresponding z-values:\n\nFor (0, 0):\ny^3 + x^3 - 3x^2 = 0^3 + 0^3 - 3(0)^2 = 0\n\nFor (2, 0):\ny^3 + x^3 - 3x^2 = 0^3 + 2^3 - 3(2)^2 = 8 - 12 = -4\n\nSo, the points where the surface has vertical tangents are (0, 0, 0) and (2, 0, -4)."
