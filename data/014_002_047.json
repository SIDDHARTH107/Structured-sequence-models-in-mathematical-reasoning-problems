Bob chooses a secret value of x=6 and Alice chooses a secret value of y=15. What is the value of the shared secret key that both Bob and Alice will use?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, we first need to calculate the public keys for both Bob and Alice.\n\nBob's public key (A) can be calculated as follows:\nA = g^x mod p\nA = 5^6 mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 8\n\nAlice's public key (B) can be calculated as follows:\nB = g^y mod p\nB = 5^15 mod 23\nB = 30517578125 mod 23\nB = 19\n\nNow, both Bob and Alice can calculate the shared secret key using each other's public keys.\n\nBob calculates the shared secret key (S) as follows:\nS = B^x mod p\nS = 19^6 mod 23\nS = 47045881 mod 23\nS = 2\n\nAlice calculates the shared secret key (S) as follows:\nS = A^y mod p\nS = 8^15 mod 23\nS = 35184372088832 mod 23\nS = 2\n\nBoth Bob and Alice have calculated the same shared secret key, which is 2."
