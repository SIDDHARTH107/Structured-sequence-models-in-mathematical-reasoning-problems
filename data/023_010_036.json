    "message_2": "To compress an image of size 512x512 to a size of 256x256 using the Fourier transformation technique, we need to retain enough coefficients to represent the compressed image without significant loss of information.\n\nThe original image has 512x512 = 262,144 pixels. The compressed image has 256x256 = 65,536 pixels. This means that we need to retain enough coefficients to represent 65,536 pixels.\n\nIn the Fourier transformation technique, the image is represented by a 2D array of coefficients. Since we are compressing the image by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, we need to retain half of the coefficients in each dimension.\n\nFor a 512x512 image, there are 512 coefficients in each dimension. To retain half of them, we need to keep 256 coefficients in each dimension. Therefore, the total number of coefficients to be retained is:\n\n256 x 256 = 65,536 coefficients\n\nSo, to compress the 512x512 image to a 256x256 image using the Fourier transformation technique without significant loss of information, we need to retain 65,536 coefficients."
