    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we need to diagonalize the matrix A. We start by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\nThe characteristic equation of A is given by:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\nwhere λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nSo, we have:\n\ndet([[2 - λ, 1], [6, 5 - λ]]) = (2 - λ)(5 - λ) - 6 = λ^2 - 7λ + 4 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get the eigenvalues λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 6.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([[1, 1], [6, 4]])([x1, x2]) = [0, 0]\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n\n[1, 1 | 0]\n[0, 0 | 0]\n\nFrom this, we have x1 = -x2. Let x2 = 1, then x1 = -1. So, the eigenvector v1 = [-1, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 6:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([[-4, 1], [6, -1]])([x1, x2]) = [0, 0]\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n\n[1, -1/4 | 0]\n[0, 0 | 0]\n\nFrom this, we have x1 = 1/4x2. Let x2 = 4, then x1 = 1. So, the eigenvector v2 = [1, 4].\n\nNow, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [[-1, 1], [1, 4]]\n\nThe diagonal matrix D will have the eigenvalues on its diagonal:\n\nD = [[1, 0], [0, 6]]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of P:\n\nP^-1 = 1/det(P) * adj(P)\n\ndet(P) = (-1)(4) - (1)(1) = -5\n\nadj(P) = [[4, -1], [-1, -1]]\n\nSo, P^-1 = (-1/5)[[4, -1], [-1, -1]]\n\nNow, we have the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P such that A = PDP^-1."
