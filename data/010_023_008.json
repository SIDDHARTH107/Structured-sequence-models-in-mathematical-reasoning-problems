    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to knot theory that a math student could solve:\n\nA knot can be represented diagrammatically as the closure of a braid. Consider the braid with six strands in the following diagram:\n\n```\n/ \\ / \\\n| 2 1 4 3 6 5 |\n\\ / \\ /\n```\n\nThis braid can be closed to form a knot. What is the minimum number of crossings in any diagram that represents this knot?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of crossings in any diagram that represents this knot, we can use the braid index and the crossing number.\n\nThe braid index is the minimum number of strands in any braid representation of the knot. In this case, the braid index is 6.\n\nThe crossing number is the minimum number of crossings in any diagram of the knot. We can use the inequality:\n\ncrossing number ≥ (3/2) * (braid index - 1)\n\nFor our knot, we have:\n\ncrossing number ≥ (3/2) * (6 - 1)\ncrossing number ≥ (3/2) * 5\ncrossing number ≥ 7.5\n\nSince the crossing number must be an integer, the minimum crossing number for this knot is 8."
