Out of the 200 students surveyed, the data showed that 30% preferred red, 25% preferred blue, 20% preferred green, and 25% preferred other colors. Using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, determine if the observed frequencies differ significantly from the expected frequencies at a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, we first need to calculate the observed frequencies and expected frequencies for each color preference.\n\nObserved Frequencies (O):\n- Red: 0.30 * 200 = 60\n- Blue: 0.25 * 200 = 50\n- Green: 0.20 * 200 = 40\n- Other: 0.25 * 200 = 50\n\nIf there is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies, we would expect the distribution to be uniform. Therefore, the expected frequencies (E) for each color would be equal to the total number of students divided by the number of color categories:\n\nExpected Frequencies (E):\n- Red: 200 / 4 = 50\n- Blue: 200 / 4 = 50\n- Green: 200 / 4 = 50\n- Other: 200 / 4 = 50\n\nNow, we can calculate the chi-squared statistic (χ²) using the formula:\n\nχ² = Σ [(O - E)² / E]\n\nχ² = [(60 - 50)² / 50] + [(50 - 50)² / 50] + [(40 - 50)² / 50] + [(50 - 50)² / 50]\nχ² = (100 / 50) + (0 / 50) + (100 / 50) + (0 / 50)\nχ² = 2 + 0 + 2 + 0\nχ² = 4\n\nNow, we need to determine the critical value for the chi-squared distribution with a significance level of 0.05 and 3 degrees of freedom (df = number of categories - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3). Using a chi-squared table or calculator, we find the critical value to be approximately 7.815.\n\nSince our calculated chi-squared statistic (4) is less than the critical value (7.815), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies at a significance level of 0.05, and the color preferences are not significantly different from a uniform distribution."
