Determine the shear stress at a distance of 0.5 cm from the center of the pipe using the Navier-Stokes equations.",
    "message_2": "To determine the shear stress at a distance of 0.5 cm from the center of the pipe, we can use the simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations for a steady, incompressible, and fully developed flow in a circular pipe, which is given by:\n\nτ = -μ * (du/dr)\n\nwhere τ is the shear stress, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, du is the change in velocity, and dr is the change in radial distance from the center of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity gradient (du/dr). Since the velocity profile is parabolic in a fully developed laminar flow, we can use the following equation:\n\nu(r) = U_max * (1 - (r/R)^2)\n\nwhere u(r) is the velocity at a radial distance r from the center of the pipe, U_max is the maximum velocity at the center of the pipe, and R is the radius of the pipe.\n\nGiven the diameter of the pipe is 2 cm, the radius R is 1 cm or 0.01 m. The maximum velocity U_max is given as 2 m/s. Now, we can find the velocity at a distance of 0.5 cm (0.005 m) from the center of the pipe:\n\nu(0.005) = 2 * (1 - (0.005/0.01)^2)\nu(0.005) = 2 * (1 - 0.25)\nu(0.005) = 2 * 0.75\nu(0.005) = 1.5 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity gradient (du/dr). We can differentiate the velocity profile equation with respect to r:\n\ndu/dr = d/dr [U_max * (1 - (r/R)^2)]\ndu/dr = -2 * U_max * (r/R^2)\n\nNow, we can find the velocity gradient at r = 0.5 cm (0.005 m):\n\n(du/dr)_0.005 = -2 * 2 * (0.005/0.01^2)\n(du/dr)_0.005 = -200 m^-1\n\nNow, we can find the shear stress using the equation τ = -μ * (du/dr):\n\nτ = -0.01 Pa·s * (-200 m^-1)\nτ = 2 Pa\n\nSo, the shear stress at a distance of 0.5 cm from the center of the pipe is 2 Pa."
