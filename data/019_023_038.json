Finally, they need to conclude that the statement is true for all positive integers.",
    "message_2": "To prove the statement using mathematical induction, the student should follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Base Case (n = 1)\nShow that the statement is true for n = 1.\n1 = 1(1+1)/2\n1 = 1(2)/2\n1 = 1\n\nThe statement is true for n = 1.\n\nStep 2: Inductive Hypothesis\nAssume the statement is true for n = k, where k is an arbitrary positive integer. That is:\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2\n\nStep 3: Inductive Step\nProve that if the statement is true for n = k, then it is also true for n = k+1.\nConsider the sum of the first k+1 positive integers:\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1)\n\nUsing the inductive hypothesis, we can replace the sum of the first k positive integers with k(k+1)/2:\nk(k+1)/2 + (k+1)\n\nFactor out (k+1):\n(k+1)(k/2 + 1)\n\nNow, simplify the expression:\n(k+1)(k/2 + 2/2)\n(k+1)((k+2)/2)\n\nThis is the same as the formula for the sum of the first k+1 positive integers, which is (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2. Therefore, the statement is true for n = k+1.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nBy mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n."
