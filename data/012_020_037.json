    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. In other words, an automorphism maps edges to edges and non-edges to non-edges. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can identify the following automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself:\n   A -> A, B -> B, C -> C, D -> D\n\n2. The automorphism that swaps vertices C and D:\n   A -> A, B -> B, C -> D, D -> C\n\nThese are the only two automorphisms that preserve the edge structure of G. To see why, note that vertex A has degree 1, while the other vertices have degree 2. Therefore, any automorphism must map A to itself, as it is the only vertex with degree 1. Similarly, B must be mapped to itself, as it is the only vertex adjacent to A. This leaves only two possibilities for the images of C and D: either they are mapped to themselves (the identity automorphism) or they are swapped (the second automorphism).\n\nThus, the automorphism group of G is the group with two elements: {identity, (C D)}, where (C D) denotes the permutation that swaps C and D. This group is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as Z_2 or C_2."
