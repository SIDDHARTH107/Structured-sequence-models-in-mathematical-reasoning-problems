    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node 1 and node 7, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of node 1 to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (node 1 initially) and mark it as visited.\n3. Update the distances of neighboring unvisited nodes by adding the distance of the current node and the weight of the edge connecting them. If the new distance is smaller than the previous distance, update the distance.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (node 7) is visited.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞, 6: ∞, 7: ∞, 8: ∞}\n\n2. Visit node 1, update neighbors:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: ∞, 5: ∞, 6: ∞, 7: ∞, 8: ∞}\n\n3. Visit node 2 (smallest distance), update neighbors:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 5, 5: ∞, 6: ∞, 7: ∞, 8: ∞}\n\n4. Visit node 4 (smallest distance), update neighbors:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 5, 5: 7, 6: 9, 7: ∞, 8: ∞}\n\n5. Visit node 3 (smallest distance), update neighbors:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 5, 5: 7, 6: 9, 7: ∞, 8: 6}\n\n6. Visit node 8 (smallest distance), update neighbors:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 5, 5: 7, 6: 9, 7: 9, 8: 6}\n\n7. Visit node 5 (smallest distance), update neighbors:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 5, 5: 7, 6: 9, 7: 9, 8: 6}\n\n8. Visit node 7 (smallest distance), target node reached.\n\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 7 is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 7 with a total length of 9."
