    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that there are 6 vertices, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. Let's analyze the possible automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism: This is the trivial automorphism that maps each vertex to itself. It is always an element of the automorphism group.\n\n2. Rotation by 120 degrees clockwise: This automorphism maps A to B, B to C, C to A, D to E, E to F, and F to D.\n\n3. Rotation by 120 degrees counterclockwise: This automorphism maps A to C, B to A, C to B, D to F, E to D, and F to E.\n\n4. Rotation by 180 degrees: This automorphism maps A to B, B to A, C to C, D to E, E to D, and F to F.\n\n5. Reflection about the vertical axis: This automorphism maps A to A, B to C, C to B, D to D, E to F, and F to E.\n\n6. Reflection about the horizontal axis: This automorphism maps A to C, B to B, C to A, D to F, E to E, and F to D.\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of this graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph has 6 elements, and can be represented as:\n\n{identity, rotation by 120 degrees clockwise, rotation by 120 degrees counterclockwise, rotation by 180 degrees, reflection about the vertical axis, reflection about the horizontal axis}"
