    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2, the derivative is (2)(3)x^(2-1) = 6x.\n\nFor the second term, 2x, the derivative is (1)(2)x^(1-1) = 2.\n\nFor the constant term, 1, the derivative is 0, since the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of each term together:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 is f'(x) = 6x + 2."
