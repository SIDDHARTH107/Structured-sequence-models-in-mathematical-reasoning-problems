    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to address the order of operations. The expression is:\n\nsin^2(x) + cos^2(x) - (cos^2(x) / sin(x))\n\nNow, we can simplify using the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:\n\n1 - (cos^2(x) / sin(x))\n\nTo express the answer in terms of sin(x) and cos(x) only, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by sin(x):\n\n1 - (cos^2(x) * sin(x) / sin^2(x))\n\nNow, we have the simplified expression:\n\n1 - (cos^2(x) * sin(x) / sin^2(x))"
