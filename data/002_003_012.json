    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and the surface area of a cube is given by the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * side^2\n\nGiven that the surface area is 150 square centimeters, we can set up the equation:\n\n150 = 6 * side^2\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of each side:\n\nside^2 = 150 / 6\nside^2 = 25\nside = âˆš25\nside = 5\n\nSo, the length of each side of the cube is 5 centimeters."
