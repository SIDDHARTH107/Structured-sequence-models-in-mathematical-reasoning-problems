    "message_1": "Consider two firms, Firm A and Firm B, competing in a Stackelberg competition. The demand function for the market is Q = 1000 - 10P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price.\n\nFirm A is the leader and sets its quantity first, while Firm B is the follower and sets its quantity after observing Firm A's output. The costs of production for both firms are given as follows:\n\n- Firm A's cost function: C_A(Q_A) = 50Q_A\n- Firm B's cost function: C_B(Q_B) = 80Q_B\n\nWhat is the profit-maximizing quantity and price for both firms in this Stackelberg competition?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing quantity and price for both firms in this Stackelberg competition, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the inverse demand function by solving the demand function for P.\n2. Calculate the profit functions for both firms.\n3. Find the reaction function for Firm B.\n4. Substitute Firm B's reaction function into Firm A's profit function.\n5. Maximize Firm A's profit function with respect to Q_A.\n6. Find the optimal Q_A and Q_B.\n7. Calculate the market price using the inverse demand function.\n\nStep 1: Find the inverse demand function\nP = (1000 - Q) / 10\n\nStep 2: Calculate the profit functions for both firms\nΠ_A = P * Q_A - C_A(Q_A) = ((1000 - Q) / 10) * Q_A - 50Q_A\nΠ_B = P * Q_B - C_B(Q_B) = ((1000 - Q) / 10) * Q_B - 80Q_B\n\nStep 3: Find the reaction function for Firm B\nTo find Firm B's reaction function, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to Q_B. To do this, we take the first-order derivative of Π_B with respect to Q_B and set it equal to 0.\n\ndΠ_B/dQ_B = (1000 - Q - 10Q_B)/10 - 80 = 0\n\nSolving for Q_B, we get the reaction function for Firm B:\n\nQ_B = (1000 - Q - 800) / 10 = (200 - Q) / 10\n\nStep 4: Substitute Firm B's reaction function into Firm A's profit function\nNow, we substitute Q_B = (200 - Q) / 10 into Firm A's profit function:\n\nΠ_A = ((1000 - Q) / 10) * Q_A - 50Q_A = ((1000 - (Q_A + (200 - Q_A) / 10)) / 10) * Q_A - 50Q_A\n\nStep 5: Maximize Firm A's profit function with respect to Q_A\nTo maximize Firm A's profit function, we take the first-order derivative of Π_A with respect to Q_A and set it equal to 0.\n\ndΠ_A/dQ_A = (1000 - 9Q_A - 200) / 100 - 50 = 0\n\nSolving for Q_A, we get the optimal quantity for Firm A:\n\nQ_A = 100\n\nStep 6: Find the optimal Q_B\nNow, we substitute Q_A = 100 into Firm B's reaction function:\n\nQ_B = (200 - 100) / 10 = 10\n\nStep 7: Calculate the market price using the inverse demand function\nP = (1000 - (Q_A + Q_B)) / 10 = (1000 - (100 + 10)) / 10 = 890 / 10 = 89\n\nSo, the profit-maximizing quantity and price for Firm A are Q_A = 100 and P = 89, and for Firm B, they are Q_B = 10 and P = 89."
