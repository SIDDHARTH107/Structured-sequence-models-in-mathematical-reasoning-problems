    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 7 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (7 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 49 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 196π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 615.75 cm^2 (rounded to two decimal places)."
