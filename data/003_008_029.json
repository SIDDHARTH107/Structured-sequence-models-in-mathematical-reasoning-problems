    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nWe are given the base (8 cm) and two adjacent angles (30 degrees and 60 degrees). We can use trigonometry to find the height of the triangle.\n\nSince we have a 30-60-90 triangle, we know that the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. Let's call the side opposite the 30-degree angle \"a,\" the side opposite the 60-degree angle \"b,\" and the hypotenuse (the side opposite the 90-degree angle) \"c.\"\n\nWe can set up the following relationships:\n\na/8 = 1/2\nb/8 = √3/2\n\nSolving for \"a\" and \"b\":\n\na = 4 cm\nb = 4√3 cm\n\nNow, we can use the side \"b\" as the height of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 8 cm * 4√3 cm\nArea = 4 cm * 4√3 cm\nArea = 16√3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 16√3 cm²."
