    "message_2": "The second-order backward difference formula for the derivative of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x - 2h) - 4f(x - h) + 3f(x)) / (2h)\n\nIn this case, we have f(x) = sin(x), x = π/4, and h = 0.1. We need to evaluate the function at x, x - h, and x - 2h:\n\nx = π/4\nx - h = π/4 - 0.1\nx - 2h = π/4 - 2(0.1)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf'(π/4) ≈ (sin(π/4 - 2(0.1)) - 4sin(π/4 - 0.1) + 3sin(π/4)) / (2 * 0.1)\n\nf'(π/4) ≈ (sin(π/4 - 0.2) - 4sin(π/4 - 0.1) + 3sin(π/4)) / 0.2\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the sine values:\n\nsin(π/4 - 0.2) ≈ 0.63469288\nsin(π/4 - 0.1) ≈ 0.72964167\nsin(π/4) ≈ 0.70710678\n\nPlug these values back into the formula:\n\nf'(π/4) ≈ (0.63469288 - 4 * 0.72964167 + 3 * 0.70710678) / 0.2\n\nf'(π/4) ≈ (0.63469288 - 2.91856668 + 2.12132034) / 0.2\n\nf'(π/4) ≈ (-0.16255346) / 0.2\n\nf'(π/4) ≈ -0.8127673\n\nSo, the approximate derivative of f(x) = sin(x) at x = π/4 using a second-order backward difference formula with a step size of h = 0.1 is -0.8127673."
