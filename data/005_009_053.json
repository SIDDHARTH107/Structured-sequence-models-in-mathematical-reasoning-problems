    "message_1": "A company wants to test the difference in productivity between two groups of employees by conducting a survey. The first group consists of 10 employees, and the second group consists of 12 employees. The data collected on their productivity is not normally distributed. Use the Mann-Whitney U-test to determine if there is a significant difference in productivity between the two groups. The sum of the ranks for the first group is 72, and the sum of the ranks for the second group is 140. Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Mann-Whitney U-test, we first need to calculate the U values for both groups. We can use the following formulas:\n\nU1 = n1 * n2 + (n1 * (n1 + 1)) / 2 - R1\nU2 = n1 * n2 + (n2 * (n2 + 1)) / 2 - R2\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the number of employees in the first and second groups, respectively, and R1 and R2 are the sum of the ranks for the first and second groups, respectively.\n\nFor the first group:\nU1 = 10 * 12 + (10 * (10 + 1)) / 2 - 72\nU1 = 120 + (10 * 11) / 2 - 72\nU1 = 120 + 55 - 72\nU1 = 103\n\nFor the second group:\nU2 = 10 * 12 + (12 * (12 + 1)) / 2 - 140\nU2 = 120 + (12 * 13) / 2 - 140\nU2 = 120 + 78 - 140\nU2 = 58\n\nNow, we need to find the smaller U value, which is U2 = 58. Next, we need to calculate the critical value for the Mann-Whitney U-test using the significance level of 0.05. Since the sample sizes are small, we can use a table of critical values for the Mann-Whitney U-test. For n1 = 10 and n2 = 12, the critical value is 40.\n\nSince the calculated U value (58) is greater than the critical value (40), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no significant difference in productivity between the two groups of employees at the 0.05 significance level."
