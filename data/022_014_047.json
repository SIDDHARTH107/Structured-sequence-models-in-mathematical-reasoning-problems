    "message_2": "To find the analytic function F(z) = f(z) + iG(z), we need to find the harmonic conjugate G(z) of u(x,y). Since u and v are harmonic functions, they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nGiven u(x,y) = 2x^2 - 2y^2 and v(x,y) = 4xy, we can compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = 4x\n∂u/∂y = -4y\n∂v/∂x = 4y\n∂v/∂y = 4x\n\nNow we can see that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y (4x = 4x)\n∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x (-4y = -4y)\n\nSince v(x,y) is given, we can find G(z) by integrating the partial derivatives of v:\n\nG(x,y) = ∫(∂v/∂x) dx + ∫(∂v/∂y) dy\nG(x,y) = ∫4y dx + ∫4x dy\nG(x,y) = 4xy + 2x^2 + C(y)\n\nNow we have F(z) = f(z) + iG(z) = (2x^2 - 2y^2) + i(4xy + 2x^2 + C(y)).\n\nTo find the contour integral of F(z) along the rectangular path with vertices at (-1,0), (1,0), (1,3), (-1,3) in a counterclockwise direction, we can use the Cauchy-Goursat theorem. This theorem states that the contour integral of an analytic function over a simple closed curve is zero. Since F(z) is analytic (u and v are harmonic and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations), the contour integral of F(z) along the rectangular path is 0."
