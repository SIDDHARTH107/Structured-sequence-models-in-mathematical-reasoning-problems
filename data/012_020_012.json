The automorphism group of a graph G, denoted Aut(G), is the set of all automorphisms of G. \n\nIn this case, the graph G has vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and edges {(1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (4,5)}. To find the automorphism group, we need to find all permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation.\n\n1. The identity permutation (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) obviously preserves the adjacency relation.\n2. The permutation (3, 2, 1, 4, 5) swaps vertices 1 and 3, and the adjacency relation is preserved.\n3. The permutation (1, 2, 3, 5, 4) swaps vertices 4 and 5, and the adjacency relation is preserved.\n4. The permutation (3, 2, 1, 5, 4) swaps vertices 1 and 3, and vertices 4 and 5, and the adjacency relation is preserved.\n\nNo other permutations of vertices preserve the adjacency relation. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is:\n\nAut(G) = {(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), (3, 2, 1, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3, 5, 4), (3, 2, 1, 5, 4)}"
