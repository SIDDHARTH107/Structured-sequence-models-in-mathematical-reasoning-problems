    "message_1": "A student wants to choose 3 candies from a bowl that has 10 different types of candies. How many outcomes are possible? (Assuming that the order in which the candies are chosen does not matter.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 10 types of candies), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 3 candies), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the combination formula:\n\nC(10, 3) = 3,628,800 / (6 × 5,040)\n\nC(10, 3) = 3,628,800 / 30,240\n\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 possible outcomes for the student to choose 3 candies from a bowl with 10 different types of candies."
