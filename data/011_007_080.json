    "message_1": "A student wants to invest in stocks for the next 5 years. They have a choice of investing in either Company A or Company B. Company A gives a return of 10% annually while Company B gives a return of 8% annually. If the student invests in Company A for the first year, what is the recurrence relation for the total return after n years if the student alternates between companies each year? What will be the total return after 5 years if they follow this alternating pattern?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the total return after n years as R(n). Since the student alternates between companies each year, we can define the recurrence relation as follows:\n\nR(n) = R(n-1) * (1 + r_n),\n\nwhere r_n is the return rate for the nth year, which alternates between 10% and 8% depending on whether n is odd or even.\n\nFor n = 1, the student invests in Company A, so r_1 = 0.10.\nFor n = 2, the student invests in Company B, so r_2 = 0.08.\nFor n = 3, the student invests in Company A again, so r_3 = 0.10.\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, let's find the total return after 5 years.\n\nR(1) = Initial Investment * (1 + 0.10)\nR(2) = R(1) * (1 + 0.08)\nR(3) = R(2) * (1 + 0.10)\nR(4) = R(3) * (1 + 0.08)\nR(5) = R(4) * (1 + 0.10)\n\nLet's assume the initial investment is $I. Then,\n\nR(1) = I * 1.10\nR(2) = R(1) * 1.08 = I * 1.10 * 1.08\nR(3) = R(2) * 1.10 = I * 1.10 * 1.08 * 1.10\nR(4) = R(3) * 1.08 = I * 1.10 * 1.08 * 1.10 * 1.08\nR(5) = R(4) * 1.10 = I * 1.10 * 1.08 * 1.10 * 1.08 * 1.10\n\nAfter simplifying, we get:\n\nR(5) = I * (1.10^3) * (1.08^2) â‰ˆ I * 1.46410\n\nSo, the total return after 5 years will be approximately 46.41% more than the initial investment."
