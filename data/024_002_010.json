    "message_2": "To find the geodesic equation for the surface of a sphere with radius 5 meters, we first need to express the sphere in spherical coordinates. The equation for a sphere with radius R in spherical coordinates is:\n\n$$x = R \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi$$\n$$y = R \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi$$\n$$z = R \\cos\\theta$$\n\nHere, R = 5 meters, and $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ are the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively.\n\nThe metric tensor for the sphere in spherical coordinates is given by:\n\n$$g_{ij} = \\begin{bmatrix} R^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & R^2 \\sin^2\\theta \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe geodesic equation for a surface can be derived from the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}^i}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q^i} = 0$$\n\nWhere $L = g_{ij} \\dot{q}^i \\dot{q}^j$ is the Lagrangian, and $\\dot{q}^i$ is the derivative of the coordinate $q^i$ with respect to the parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nFor the sphere, the geodesic equations are:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left(2 R^2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\dot{\\phi}^2\\right) - R^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left(2 R^2 \\sin^2\\theta \\dot{\\phi}\\right) - 0 = 0$$\n\nNow, we need to find the shortest path (geodesic) between two points on the sphere located at (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) in terms of the polar angle $\\theta$.\n\nThe points in spherical coordinates are:\n\nPoint A: $(R, \\theta_A, \\phi_A) = (5, \\pi/2, 0)$\nPoint B: $(R, \\theta_B, \\phi_B) = (5, \\pi/2, \\pi)$\n\nSince the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ changes from 0 to $\\pi$, the polar angle $\\theta$ remains constant at $\\pi/2$. Therefore, the shortest path (geodesic) between the two points on the sphere is a great circle with constant polar angle $\\theta = \\pi/2$."
