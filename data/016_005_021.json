    "message_2": "The Cantor set is formed by iteratively removing the middle third of each segment. After each iteration, the remaining length is multiplied by 2/3. \n\nTo find the total length of the Cantor set after the first 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (2/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the given problem, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 5 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (2/3)^5\nLength = 1 * (32/243)\nLength â‰ˆ 0.1316872428\n\nSo, the total length of the Cantor set after the first 5 iterations is approximately 0.1316872428."
