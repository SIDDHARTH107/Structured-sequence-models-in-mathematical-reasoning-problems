    "message_1": "A manufacturing company is planning to produce two types of products, A and B. The cost of producing product A is $50 per unit and the cost of producing product B is $80 per unit. The company has a budget of $12,000 for production and can produce a maximum of 150 units of A and 100 units of B. The selling price of product A is $120 per unit and the selling price of product B is $150 per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit. \n\nHow many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit? Formulate the problem as a mixed-integer programming problem and find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit): \nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nProfit = (120x + 150y) - (50x + 80y)\nProfit = 70x + 70y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Budget constraint: 50x + 80y ≤ 12,000\n2. Maximum units of product A: x ≤ 150\n3. Maximum units of product B: y ≤ 100\n4. Non-negativity constraints: x, y ≥ 0\n\nThe mixed-integer programming problem can be formulated as:\n\nMaximize: P = 70x + 70y\n\nSubject to:\n50x + 80y ≤ 12,000\nx ≤ 150\ny ≤ 100\nx, y ≥ 0 and integers\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use a graphical method or software tools like Python's PuLP library or Excel Solver. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\n1. Plot the constraints on a graph with x-axis representing product A and y-axis representing product B.\n2. Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region.\n4. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex.\n5. Choose the vertex with the highest profit value.\n\nAfter plotting the constraints and finding the vertices of the feasible region, we have the following vertices: (0, 100), (0, 150), (150, 0), and (100, 50).\n\nEvaluate the profit function at each vertex:\nP(0, 100) = 70(0) + 70(100) = 7,000\nP(0, 150) = 70(0) + 70(150) = 10,500\nP(150, 0) = 70(150) + 70(0) = 10,500\nP(100, 50) = 70(100) + 70(50) = 10,500\n\nThe maximum profit of $10,500 can be achieved by producing any of the following combinations of products A and B: (0, 150), (150, 0), or (100, 50). The company can choose any of these production plans to maximize its profit."
