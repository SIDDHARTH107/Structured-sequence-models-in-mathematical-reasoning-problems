The relevant formulas for the energy eigenvalues are:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) hbar omega\n\nwhere omega = sqrt(k/m) is the angular frequency and hbar is the reduced Planck constant.",
    "message_2": "To find the first five energy levels, we need to plug in the values of n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 into the energy eigenvalue formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) hbar omega\n\nwhere omega = sqrt(k/m).\n\n1. For n = 0:\nE_0 = (0 + 1/2) hbar omega = (1/2) hbar omega\n\n2. For n = 1:\nE_1 = (1 + 1/2) hbar omega = (3/2) hbar omega\n\n3. For n = 2:\nE_2 = (2 + 1/2) hbar omega = (5/2) hbar omega\n\n4. For n = 3:\nE_3 = (3 + 1/2) hbar omega = (7/2) hbar omega\n\n5. For n = 4:\nE_4 = (4 + 1/2) hbar omega = (9/2) hbar omega\n\nSo, the first five energy levels of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle with mass m in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential are:\n\nE_0 = (1/2) hbar omega\nE_1 = (3/2) hbar omega\nE_2 = (5/2) hbar omega\nE_3 = (7/2) hbar omega\nE_4 = (9/2) hbar omega"
