    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem based on the Traveler's Dilemma in Game Theory:\n\nTwo air travelers are returning from a trip with identical antiques they picked up in a foreign country. At customs, the agents ask each traveler to name the value of the antique, with the warning that if they find the value to be incorrect, they will confiscate the antique and impose a fine. The true value of the antique is $200. The possible values each traveler can declare are integers between $2 and $200.\n\nIf both travelers declare the true value, they each receive a reward of $200. However, if one traveler declares a lower value than the other, the lower declaration receives a reward of $2 more than the higher declaration, while the higher declaration receives a reward equal to the declared value.\n\nWhat is the optimal bid for each traveler to make?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal bid for each traveler, we can use backward induction. We start by considering the highest possible bid of $200. If one traveler bids $200, the other traveler can bid $199 and receive a reward of $201. However, if the first traveler anticipates this and bids $199, the second traveler can bid $198 and receive a reward of $200. This pattern continues all the way down to the lowest possible bid of $2.\n\nIn this scenario, both travelers have an incentive to keep lowering their bids, as they can always gain an additional $2 by bidding one dollar less than their opponent. This leads to a \"race to the bottom,\" with both travelers ultimately bidding the minimum value of $2.\n\nTherefore, the optimal bid for each traveler in this game is $2."
