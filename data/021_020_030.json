    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It is used to find the minimum or maximum of a given function. In this case, we want to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x + 10.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the ABC algorithm to find the minimum value of the function:\n\n1. Initialize the population of bees (solutions) randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each bee (solution) using the given function.\n3. Repeat the following steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations):\n   a. Employed bees search for new solutions in the neighborhood of their current solutions.\n   b. Calculate the fitness of the new solutions.\n   c. If the new solution is better than the current solution, replace the current solution with the new one.\n   d. Onlooker bees select solutions based on their fitness and search for new solutions in the neighborhood of the selected solutions.\n   e. Calculate the fitness of the new solutions.\n   f. If the new solution is better than the current solution, replace the current solution with the new one.\n   g. Scout bees search for new solutions randomly within the search space if a solution has not improved for a certain number of iterations.\n4. Return the best solution found.\n\nApplying the ABC algorithm to the given function f(x) = x^4 - 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x + 10, we can find the minimum value of the function. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute the algorithm and provide a numerical result. You can implement the ABC algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB to find the minimum value of the function."
