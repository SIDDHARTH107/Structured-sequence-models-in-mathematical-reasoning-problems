    "message_2": "To find the equation for the height of a rider on the ferris wheel as a function of time, we can model the motion using a sinusoidal function. Since the wheel starts at the lowest point, we will use a cosine function.\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is:\n\nh(t) = A * cos(B(t - C)) + D\n\nwhere h(t) is the height of the rider at time t, A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nThe diameter of the ferris wheel is 50 feet, so the radius is 25 feet. This means that the amplitude (A) is 25 feet, as the rider moves 25 feet above and below the center of the wheel.\n\nThe period of the function is the time it takes for the wheel to complete one full revolution, which is 40 seconds. To find the frequency (B), we use the formula:\n\nB = 2π / period\n\nB = 2π / 40 = π / 20\n\nSince the wheel starts at the lowest point, there is no phase shift (C = 0).\n\nThe vertical shift (D) is the height of the center of the wheel, which is equal to the radius (25 feet).\n\nNow we can write the equation for the height of the rider as a function of time:\n\nh(t) = 25 * cos(π/20 * t) + 25\n\nThe amplitude of the function is 25 feet, and the period is 40 seconds."
