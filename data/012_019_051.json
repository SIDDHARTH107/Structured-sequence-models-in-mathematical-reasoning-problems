    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic index of the given graph G, we first need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph. The chromatic index is the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nThe degree of each vertex in the graph G is as follows:\ndeg(A) = 4\ndeg(B) = 4\ndeg(C) = 4\ndeg(D) = 4\ndeg(E) = 4\n\nThe maximum degree (Δ) of the graph G is 4.\n\nAccording to Vizing's Theorem, the chromatic index (χ'(G)) of a graph G is either equal to the maximum degree (Δ) or Δ + 1. So, the chromatic index of G is either 4 or 5.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges of the graph G using 4 colors. We can use the following edge coloring:\n\n1. (A, B) - color 1\n2. (B, C) - color 2\n3. (C, D) - color 3\n4. (D, E) - color 4\n5. (E, A) - color 2\n6. (A, C) - color 3\n7. (B, D) - color 4\n8. (C, E) - color 1\n9. (D, A) - color 1\n10. (E, B) - color 3\n\nSince we were able to color the edges of the graph G using 4 colors without any two adjacent edges sharing the same color, the chromatic index of the graph G is 4."
