    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow that can be transported from node A to node D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we initialize the flow on all edges to 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path:\n\n   One possible augmenting path is A -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is min(3, 6) = 3.\n\n3. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   AC: 3 - 3 = 0\n   CD: 6 - 3 = 3\n\n4. Find another augmenting path:\n\n   Another possible augmenting path is A -> B -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is min(7, 5) = 5.\n\n5. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   AB: 7 - 5 = 2\n   BD: 5 - 5 = 0\n\n6. Find another augmenting path:\n\n   Another possible augmenting path is A -> B -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is min(2, 8, 3) = 2.\n\n7. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   AB: 2 - 2 = 0\n   BC: 8 - 2 = 6\n   CD: 3 - 2 = 1\n\nAt this point, there are no more augmenting paths from A to D. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows along the paths we found: 3 + 5 + 2 = 10. Therefore, the maximum flow that can be transported from node A to node D in this network is 10."
