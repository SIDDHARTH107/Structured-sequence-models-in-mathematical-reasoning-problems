    "message_2": "The Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm that helps us determine if a given number is prime or not. To use the Miller-Rabin test, we first need to rewrite the given number (n) as 2^r * d + 1, where r and d are positive integers and d is odd.\n\nFor n = 37, we can rewrite it as:\n37 = 2^3 * 4 + 1, with r = 3 and d = 4.\n\nNow, we need to choose some random integers (called witnesses) a, where 2 ≤ a ≤ n-2. For this example, let's choose a = 2 and a = 3. We will perform the test for each witness.\n\nFor a = 2:\n1. Compute a^d mod n: 2^4 mod 37 = 16\n2. If the result is 1 or n-1 (36), the test is inconclusive. In this case, it's not.\n3. For each i in the range [1, r), compute a^(2^i * d) mod n:\n   - i = 1: 2^(2^1 * 4) mod 37 = 2^8 mod 37 = 256 mod 37 = 1\n   Since the result is 1, the test is inconclusive for a = 2.\n\nFor a = 3:\n1. Compute a^d mod n: 3^4 mod 37 = 81 mod 37 = 10\n2. If the result is 1 or n-1 (36), the test is inconclusive. In this case, it's not.\n3. For each i in the range [1, r), compute a^(2^i * d) mod n:\n   - i = 1: 3^(2^1 * 4) mod 37 = 3^8 mod 37 = 6561 mod 37 = 1\n   Since the result is 1, the test is inconclusive for a = 3.\n\nSince the Miller-Rabin test is inconclusive for both witnesses, we cannot definitively say that 37 is composite. However, since the test did not find any evidence that 37 is composite, it is likely that 37 is prime. In fact, 37 is a prime number, but we would need to use a deterministic primality test (like the AKS primality test) to prove it conclusively."
