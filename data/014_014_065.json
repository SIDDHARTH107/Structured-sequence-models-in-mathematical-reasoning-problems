    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH IS FUN\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid using the key \"CRYPTO\" and filling the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding \"J\" since it's combined with \"I\" in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   C  R  Y  P  T\n   O  A  B  D  E\n   F  G  H  I  K\n   L  M  N  S  U\n   V  W  X  Z  Q\n\n2. Prepare the message by removing spaces and splitting it into pairs. If a pair has the same letters, insert an \"X\" between them. If the message has an odd number of characters, add an \"X\" at the end.\n\n   MA  TH  IS  FU  NX\n\n3. For each pair, follow the Playfair cipher rules:\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle.\n\n   Encrypted pairs:\n   MA -> OD\n   TH -> YK\n   IS -> CF\n   FU -> RT\n   NX -> ZQ\n\n4. Combine the encrypted pairs to get the final encrypted message:\n\n   ODYKCFRTZQ"
