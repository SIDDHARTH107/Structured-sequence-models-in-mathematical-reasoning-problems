    "message_2": "To solve the complex number equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nz = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(1)(13))) / 2(1)\nz = (-4 ± √(16 - 52)) / 2\nz = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root of -36 as follows:\n\n√(-36) = √(36 * -1) = √(36) * √(-1) = 6i\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nz = (-4 ± 6i) / 2\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\nz = (-2 ± 3i)\n\nThus, the two complex solutions for the given equation are:\n\nz1 = -2 + 3i\nz2 = -2 - 3i"
