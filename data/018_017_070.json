This means we will create ordered pairs with elements from A and B, such that the first element is from A and the second element is from B.\n\nA ⊗ B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find B △ B, which represents the symmetric difference of B with itself. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either B or B, but not in both.\n\nB △ B = {}\n\nNow, let's find (A ⊗ B) △ B. Since B is a set of single elements and (A ⊗ B) is a set of ordered pairs, their symmetric difference will be the same as the union of the two sets, as there are no common elements between them.\n\n(A ⊗ B) △ B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), 2, 3, 4}\n\nFinally, let's find A ⊗ (B △ B).
