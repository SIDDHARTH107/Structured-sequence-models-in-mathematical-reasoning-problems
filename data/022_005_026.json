    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2+4z+13}$ at the pole $z=-2+3i$, we first need to factor the denominator and rewrite the function in terms of partial fractions.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n$z^2 + 4z + 13 = (z + 2 - 3i)(z + 2 + 3i)$\n\nNow we can rewrite the function as:\n$f(z) = \\frac{A}{z + 2 - 3i} + \\frac{B}{z + 2 + 3i}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator, we get:\n$1 = A(z + 2 + 3i) + B(z + 2 - 3i)$\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in the values of the poles:\nFor A, let $z = -2 + 3i$:\n$1 = A(3i + 3i) + B(0)$\n$1 = 6iA$\n$A = \\frac{1}{6i} = -\\frac{i}{6}$\n\nFor B, let $z = -2 - 3i$:\n$1 = A(0) + B(-3i - 3i)$\n$1 = -6iB$\n$B = -\\frac{1}{6i} = \\frac{i}{6}$\n\nNow, we have the partial fraction decomposition:\n$f(z) = -\\frac{i}{6(z + 2 - 3i)} + \\frac{i}{6(z + 2 + 3i)}$\n\nThe residue at the pole $z = -2 + 3i$ is the coefficient of the term with the denominator $(z + 2 - 3i)$, which is $-\\frac{i}{6}$."
