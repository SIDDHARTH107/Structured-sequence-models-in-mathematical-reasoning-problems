    "message_2": "To avoid creating a cycle of length 3 (triangle), we can construct a bipartite graph. A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V. In a bipartite graph, there are no cycles of odd length, including triangles.\n\nLet's assume that the bipartite graph has |U| vertices in set U and |V| vertices in set V. The maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph is |U| * |V|, as each vertex in U can be connected to each vertex in V.\n\nSince we have n vertices in total, we can distribute them between U and V to maximize the number of edges. To do this, we should aim to have a balanced partition, i.e., |U| ≈ |V|. If n is even, we can divide the vertices equally between U and V, so |U| = |V| = n/2. If n is odd, we can have |U| = (n+1)/2 and |V| = (n-1)/2 or vice versa.\n\nFor even n:\nMaximum number of edges = (n/2) * (n/2) = n^2 / 4\n\nFor odd n:\nMaximum number of edges = ((n+1)/2) * ((n-1)/2) = (n^2 - 1) / 4\n\nIn general, the maximum number of edges without creating a cycle of length 3 can be expressed as:\n\n⌊n^2 / 4⌋\n\nwhere ⌊x⌋ denotes the floor function, which rounds x down to the nearest integer."
