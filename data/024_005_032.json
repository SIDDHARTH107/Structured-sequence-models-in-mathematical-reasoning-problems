    "message_1": "Let S be a surface in 3-dimensional space given by the equation x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1. Determine the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1, 0, 0).",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface S by a function F(u, v) = (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)). We can use the following parameterization:\n\nF(u, v) = (cosh(u) * cos(v), cosh(u) * sin(v), sinh(u))\n\nNow, we need to find the first fundamental form, which is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [E, F]\n    [F, G]\n\nWhere E = <F_u, F_u>, F = <F_u, F_v>, and G = <F_v, F_v>. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\nF_u = (sinh(u) * cos(v), sinh(u) * sin(v), cosh(u))\nF_v = (-cosh(u) * sin(v), cosh(u) * cos(v), 0)\n\nNow, we can compute E, F, and G:\n\nE = <F_u, F_u> = (sinh(u) * cos(v))^2 + (sinh(u) * sin(v))^2 + (cosh(u))^2 = sinh^2(u) + cosh^2(u) = cosh^2(u)\nF = <F_u, F_v> = 0\nG = <F_v, F_v> = (-cosh(u) * sin(v))^2 + (cosh(u) * cos(v))^2 = cosh^2(u) * (sin^2(v) + cos^2(v)) = cosh^2(u)\n\nSo, the first fundamental form is:\n\nI = [cosh^2(u), 0]\n    [0, cosh^2(u)]\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form, which is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [L, M]\n     [M, N]\n\nWhere L = <F_uu, N>, M = <F_uv, N>, and N = <F_vv, N>. Let's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nF_uu = (cosh(u) * cos(v), cosh(u) * sin(v), sinh(u))\nF_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nF_vv = (-cosh(u) * cos(v), -cosh(u) * sin(v), 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the normal vector N at the point (1, 0, 0). We can find it by taking the cross product of F_u and F_v:\n\nN = F_u Ã— F_v = (cosh(u) * sin(v), -cosh(u) * cos(v), 0)\n\nAt the point (1, 0, 0), we have u = 0 and v = 0. So, N = (0, -1, 0).\n\nNow, we can compute L, M, and N:\n\nL = <F_uu, N> = cosh(u) * sin(v) = 0\nM = <F_uv, N> = 0\nN = <F_vv, N> = -cosh(u) * sin(v) = -1\n\nSo, the second fundamental form is:\n\nII = [0, 0]\n     [0, -1]\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by finding the eigenvalues of the matrix product (I^(-1) * II):\n\nI^(-1) = [1/cosh^2(u), 0]\n         [0, 1/cosh^2(u)]\n\nI^(-1) * II = [0, 0]\n              [0, -1/cosh^2(u)]\n\nAt the point (1, 0, 0), we have u = 0, so:\n\nI^(-1) * II = [0, 0]\n              [0, -1]\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are the principal curvatures, which are k1 = 0 and k2 = -1."
