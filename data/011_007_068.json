    "message_2": "To find the total number of handshakes, we can use the formula for combinations, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of people and k is the number of people involved in each handshake (which is 2 in this case).\n\nSo, we have C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\n\n= 8! / (2!6!)\n\n= (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2 × 1 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\n= (8 × 7) / (2 × 1)\n\n= 28\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 28 handshakes that occurred in the group."
