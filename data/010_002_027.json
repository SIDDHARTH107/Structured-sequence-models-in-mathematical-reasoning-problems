    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, every subset of X is an open set. To prove that the sequence (x_n) converges to x in X, we need to show that for every open neighborhood U of x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N, x_n ∈ U.\n\nFirst, let's find the sequence (x_n):\n\nx_1 = f(1) = 2\nx_2 = f(f(1)) = f(2) = 3\nx_3 = f(f(f(1))) = f(3) = 4\nx_4 = f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(4) = 1\nx_5 = f(f(f(f(f(1))))) = f(1) = 2\nx_6 = f(f(f(f(f(f(1)))))) = f(2) = 3\n...\n\nThe sequence (x_n) is periodic with period 4: (2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, ...).\n\nNow, let's consider the open neighborhood U of x = {1, 2}. Since X has the discrete topology, U is an open set. There are three cases to consider:\n\n1. U contains both 1 and 2: In this case, for any n ≥ 1, x_n ∈ U, since the sequence (x_n) contains both 1 and 2 periodically.\n\n2. U contains only 1: In this case, for any n ≥ 4 and n ≡ 0 (mod 4), x_n ∈ U, since the sequence (x_n) contains 1 periodically with a period of 4.\n\n3. U contains only 2: In this case, for any n ≥ 1 and n ≡ 1 (mod 4), x_n ∈ U, since the sequence (x_n) contains 2 periodically with a period of 4.\n\nIn all three cases, we can find a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N, x_n ∈ U. Therefore, the sequence (x_n) converges to x in X."
