    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the linear system |D|, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on a smooth projective curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) denotes the dimension of the linear system |D|, K is the canonical divisor on X, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nIn our case, we have a curve X of genus g = 3 and a divisor D with deg(D) = 4. We want to find l(D). To do this, we need to find l(K - D) and the canonical divisor K.\n\nThe canonical divisor K is associated with the canonical bundle, which is the cotangent bundle of X. For a curve of genus g, the degree of the canonical divisor is given by:\n\ndeg(K) = 2g - 2.\n\nIn our case, with g = 3, we have:\n\ndeg(K) = 2(3) - 2 = 4.\n\nNow we can find the degree of K - D:\n\ndeg(K - D) = deg(K) - deg(D) = 4 - 4 = 0.\n\nSince deg(K - D) = 0, we know that l(K - D) = 1, as the only divisor of degree 0 is the trivial divisor, which has a one-dimensional space of global sections.\n\nNow we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to find l(D):\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\nl(D) - 1 = 4 + 1 - 3\nl(D) = 3.\n\nThus, the dimension of the linear system |D| is 3."
