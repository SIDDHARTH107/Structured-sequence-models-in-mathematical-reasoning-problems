    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs in a manufacturing process. The probability of a light bulb being defective is 0.05. How many light bulbs must the company produce in order to expect 10 defective bulbs?",
    "message_2": "Let X be the number of light bulbs the company needs to produce to expect 10 defective bulbs. We can use the expected value formula to solve this problem.\n\nExpected value (E) = Probability (P) × Number of trials (X)\n\nIn this case, the expected value (E) is 10 defective bulbs, and the probability (P) of a light bulb being defective is 0.05.\n\n10 = 0.05 × X\n\nTo find the number of trials (X), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.05.\n\nX = 10 / 0.05\nX = 200\n\nThe company must produce 200 light bulbs in order to expect 10 defective bulbs."
