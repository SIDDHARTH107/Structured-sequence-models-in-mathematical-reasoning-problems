What is the total weight of the minimum spanning tree?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree. If it does, discard the edge.\n\nSorted edges by weight:\n```\nBC: 1\nAC: 2\nCE: 3\nDE: 4\nAB: 5\nBD: 6\nAD: 7\nBE: 8\nEF: 9\n```\n\nNow, let's add the edges one by one:\n\n1. Add BC (weight 1).\n2. Add AC (weight 2).\n3. Add CE (weight 3).\n4. Add DE (weight 4). At this point, adding DE would form a cycle (ACED), so we discard it.\n5. Add AB (weight 5).\n6. Add BD (weight 6). At this point, adding BD would form a cycle (ABCD), so we discard it.\n7. Add AD (weight 7). At this point, adding AD would form a cycle (ACD), so we discard it.\n8. Add BE (weight 8).\n9. Add EF (weight 9). At this point, adding EF would form a cycle (BEF), so we discard it.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete with the following edges and their weights:\n\n```\nBC: 1\nAC: 2\nCE: 3\nAB: 5\nBE: 8\n```\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 19."
