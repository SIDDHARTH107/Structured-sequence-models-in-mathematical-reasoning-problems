    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg that measures 8 cm and another leg that measures 15 cm. What is the length of its hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two legs (a and b). In this case, a = 8 cm and b = 15 cm. The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc² = (8 cm)² + (15 cm)²\nc² = 64 cm² + 225 cm²\nc² = 289 cm²\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = √(289 cm²)\nc = 17 cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 17 cm."
