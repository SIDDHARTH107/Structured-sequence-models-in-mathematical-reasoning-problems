The researcher then gathers a random sample of 100 customers and finds that 70 of them have purchased the product. Assuming a beta prior distribution for the proportion parameter, what is the posterior distribution of the proportion?",
    "message_2": "To find the posterior distribution of the proportion, we need to update the prior distribution with the data from the random sample. In this case, the prior distribution is a beta distribution with parameters α and β. Since the prior belief is that the proportion of customers who will purchase the product is 0.6, we can set the prior distribution as Beta(α, β) with mean α / (α + β) = 0.6. However, we need specific values for α and β to proceed. Without specific values, we can only express the posterior distribution in terms of α and β.\n\nThe likelihood function for the data is given by the binomial distribution, since we have a random sample of 100 customers and 70 of them purchased the product. The likelihood function is:\n\nL(p) = C(100, 70) * p^70 * (1-p)^(100-70)\n\nwhere p is the proportion of customers who will purchase the product, and C(100, 70) is the number of combinations of 100 customers taken 70 at a time.\n\nNow, we can update the prior distribution with the likelihood function to find the posterior distribution:\n\nPosterior(p) ∝ Prior(p) * L(p)\n\nSince the prior distribution is a beta distribution, we have:\n\nPrior(p) = Beta(α, β) = Γ(α + β) / (Γ(α) * Γ(β)) * p^(α-1) * (1-p)^(β-1)\n\nwhere Γ is the gamma function.\n\nMultiplying the prior distribution by the likelihood function, we get:\n\nPosterior(p) ∝ p^(α-1) * (1-p)^(β-1) * p^70 * (1-p)^30\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nPosterior(p) ∝ p^(α+70-1) * (1-p)^(β+30-1)\n\nThis is the kernel of a beta distribution with parameters α' = α + 70 and β' = β + 30. Therefore, the posterior distribution of the proportion is:\n\nPosterior(p) = Beta(α + 70, β + 30)"
