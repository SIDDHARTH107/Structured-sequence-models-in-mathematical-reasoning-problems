An observer standing at the center of the wheel records the height of a passenger as the wheel revolves. The height of the passenger can be modeled by the function h(t) = -25 cos(π/20 t) + 25, where t is time in seconds. Determine the period and amplitude of the passenger's height.",
    "message_2": "The given function is h(t) = -25 cos(π/20 t) + 25. This is a cosine function of the form h(t) = A cos(Bt) + C, where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, A = -25, B = π/20, and C = 25.\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of A, which is |-25| = 25 meters. This means that the passenger's height oscillates 25 meters above and below the center of the Ferris wheel.\n\nTo find the period of the function, we can use the formula T = 2π/B, where T is the period and B is the angular frequency.\n\nT = 2π/(π/20) = 2π * (20/π) = 40 seconds.\n\nSo, the period of the passenger's height is 40 seconds, which matches the time it takes for the Ferris wheel to complete one rotation.\n\nIn conclusion, the amplitude of the passenger's height is 25 meters, and the period is 40 seconds."
