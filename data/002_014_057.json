    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 7 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of the front and back faces (length x height): 5 cm * 7 cm = 35 cm². Since there are 2 faces, the total area is 35 cm² * 2 = 70 cm².\n\n2. The area of the top and bottom faces (length x width): 5 cm * 3 cm = 15 cm². Since there are 2 faces, the total area is 15 cm² * 2 = 30 cm².\n\n3. The area of the left and right faces (width x height): 3 cm * 7 cm = 21 cm². Since there are 2 faces, the total area is 21 cm² * 2 = 42 cm².\n\nNow, add the areas of all the faces together: 70 cm² + 30 cm² + 42 cm² = 142 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 142 cm²."
