    "message_2": "According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn a planar graph, each face must have at least 3 edges, and each edge is shared by at most 2 faces. Therefore, we have:\n\n3F ≤ 2E\n\nCombining this inequality with Euler's formula, we get:\n\nV - E + F ≥ V - E + (2/3)E = V + (1/3)E ≥ 2\n\nRearranging the inequality, we have:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nFor a planar graph with 8 vertices (V = 8), the maximum number of edges (E) is:\n\nE ≤ 3(8) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges a planar graph with 8 vertices can have is 18."
