    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry. \n\nLet Vb represent the boat's velocity (10 mph southward) and Vr represent the river's velocity (6 mph eastward). We want to find the magnitude of the resultant velocity (Vt) and its direction (θ).\n\nFirst, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nVt^2 = Vb^2 + Vr^2\nVt^2 = (10 mph)^2 + (6 mph)^2\nVt^2 = 100 + 36\nVt^2 = 136\nVt = √136\nVt ≈ 11.66 mph\n\nNow, we can find the direction of the resultant velocity using trigonometry. We can use the tangent function to find the angle θ:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(θ) = Vr / Vb\ntan(θ) = 6 mph / 10 mph\ntan(θ) = 0.6\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse tangent (arctan) of 0.6:\n\nθ = arctan(0.6)\nθ ≈ 30.96°\n\nSince the boat is traveling southward and the river is flowing eastward, the direction of the resultant velocity is southeast. Therefore, the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground are approximately 11.66 mph and 30.96° southeast."
