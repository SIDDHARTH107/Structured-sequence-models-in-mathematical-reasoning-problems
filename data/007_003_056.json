    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 2^10 is divided by 7, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We can first find the remainders of the powers of 2 when divided by 7 and look for a pattern.\n\n2^1 % 7 = 2\n2^2 % 7 = 4\n2^3 % 7 = 1\n2^4 % 7 = 2\n2^5 % 7 = 4\n2^6 % 7 = 1\n\nWe can see that the remainders repeat in a cycle of 2, 4, 1. Now, we can find the remainder of 10 when divided by the length of the cycle (which is 3):\n\n10 % 3 = 1\n\nSince the remainder is 1, the remainder of 2^10 when divided by 7 will be the same as the first element in the cycle:\n\n2^10 % 7 = 2"
