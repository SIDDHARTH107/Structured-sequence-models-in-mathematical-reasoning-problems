    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest game where there are 10 players and each player needs to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game will be the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the chosen numbers. What number should you choose to maximize your chances of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning the game, you should try to predict what the other players will choose and then choose a number that is 2/3 of the predicted average. This is because the winner is the one whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers.\n\nLet's assume that all players choose their numbers randomly and uniformly from the range [0, 100]. In this case, the expected average of the chosen numbers would be 50 (since the midpoint of the range is 50). \n\nNow, you should choose a number that is 2/3 of this expected average, which is:\n\n(2/3) * 50 = 100/3 ≈ 33.33\n\nHowever, this is just the first level of reasoning. If all players think like this, they will all choose around 33.33. In this case, the new expected average would be 33.33, and you should choose 2/3 of that:\n\n(2/3) * 33.33 ≈ 22.22\n\nThis process can be iterated multiple times, with each iteration representing a higher level of reasoning. However, it's important to note that not all players will necessarily think at the same level of reasoning, and some might still choose numbers randomly or based on personal preferences.\n\nIn practice, it's difficult to predict exactly what number to choose to maximize your chances of winning, as it depends on the reasoning levels of the other players. However, choosing a number around 22.22 could be a reasonable strategy, as it represents a second level of reasoning and might outperform players who only think at the first level."
