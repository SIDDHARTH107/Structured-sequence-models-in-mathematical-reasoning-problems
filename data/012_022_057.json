    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,4) is 9. This means that in any graph with 9 vertices, there must be either a complete subgraph with 3 vertices (a triangle) where all edges are the same color or a complete subgraph with 4 vertices (a tetrahedron) where all edges are the same color.\n\nThe corresponding complete graph has 9 vertices. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The number of edges in a complete graph can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEdges = (n * (n - 1)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn this case, n = 9, so the number of edges is:\n\nEdges = (9 * (9 - 1)) / 2 = (9 * 8) / 2 = 72 / 2 = 36\n\nSo, the corresponding complete graph has 9 vertices and 36 edges."
