    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot directly draw graphs. However, I can guide you through the process of graphing the function y = 2sin(3x + π/2) for values of x ranging from 0 to 2π.\n\n1. Identify the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift.\n\nAmplitude (A): The coefficient of the sine function is 2, so the amplitude is 2. The graph will oscillate between -2 and 2.\n\nPeriod (T): The period of the sine function is 2π divided by the absolute value of the coefficient of x, which is 3 in this case. So, the period is T = 2π/3.\n\nPhase Shift (PS): The phase shift is determined by the value inside the parentheses. In this case, it is π/2. Since it is positive, the graph will shift to the left by π/2.\n\nVertical Shift (VS): There is no vertical shift in this function since there is no constant added or subtracted outside the sine function.\n\n2. Set up the graph.\n\nDraw the x and y axes. Label the x-axis with values from 0 to 2π. Divide the x-axis into equal intervals according to the period (2π/3). Label the y-axis with values from -2 to 2, as the amplitude is 2.\n\n3. Plot the key points.\n\nStart at the phase shift (π/2) and plot the key points of the sine function:\n\n- At x = π/2, y = 2sin(3(π/2) + π/2) = 2sin(5π/2) = 2(1) = 2.\n- At x = π/2 + (2π/3)/4, y = 2sin(3(3π/4) + π/2) = 2sin(9π/4) = 2(0) = 0.\n- At x = π/2 + (2π/3)/2, y = 2sin(3(π) + π/2) = 2sin(11π/2) = 2(-1) = -2.\n- At x = π/2 + 3(2π/3)/4, y = 2sin(3(5π/4) + π/2) = 2sin(13π/4) = 2(0) = 0.\n- At x = π/2 + 2π/3, y = 2sin(3(3π/2) + π/2) = 2sin(15π/2) = 2(1) = 2.\n\n4. Connect the points.\n\nDraw a smooth curve connecting the points, making sure the curve oscillates between -2 and 2.\n\n5. Repeat the pattern.\n\nSince the period is 2π/3, the graph will repeat itself every 2π/3 units. Continue plotting points and connecting them with a smooth curve until you reach the end of the x-axis (2π).\n\nThat's it! You have successfully graphed the function y = 2sin(3x + π/2) for values of x ranging from 0 to 2π."
