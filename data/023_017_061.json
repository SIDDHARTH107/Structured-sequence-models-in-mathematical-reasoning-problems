    "message_1": "A cylindrical tank with a radius of 2 meters is initially filled with water. A small disturbance causes a wave to propagate along the surface of the water. The wave can be described by the function h(x,t) = 0.2 sin(10t - 3x), where x is the horizontal distance in meters and t is time in seconds. Use the Fourier transform to determine the amplitude and wavelength of the wave.",
    "message_2": "The given wave function is h(x, t) = 0.2 sin(10t - 3x). We can rewrite this function in terms of the angular frequency (ω) and the wave number (k) as follows:\n\nh(x, t) = A sin(ωt - kx)\n\nComparing the given function with the general form, we can identify the amplitude, angular frequency, and wave number:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 0.2\nAngular frequency (ω) = 10 rad/s\nWave number (k) = 3 rad/m\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength and frequency using the following relationships:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 2π / k\nFrequency (f) = ω / 2π\n\nCalculating the wavelength and frequency:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 2π / 3 ≈ 2.09 meters\nFrequency (f) = 10 / 2π ≈ 1.59 Hz\n\nSo, the amplitude of the wave is 0.2 meters, and the wavelength is approximately 2.09 meters."
