    "message_2": "To find out how many students are not studying either Spanish or French, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of students = Students studying Spanish + Students studying French - Students studying both + Students studying neither\n\nLet's denote the number of students studying neither as N.\n\n50 = 30 + 25 - 10 + N\n\nNow, we can solve for N:\n\n50 = 45 - 10 + N\n50 = 35 + N\nN = 50 - 35\nN = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 students in the group who are not studying either Spanish or French."
