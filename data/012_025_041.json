    "message_2": "To find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph, we can try to construct a path that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. One possible Hamiltonian cycle is:\n\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> A\n\nThis cycle uses the edges AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH, and HA, and it visits each vertex exactly once before returning to the starting vertex A."
