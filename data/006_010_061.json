    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a group of 80 people, at least 10 people are affected by a disease, given the probability of an individual in the demographic group being affected by the disease is 0.15?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k people being affected by the disease\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k! * (n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of an individual being affected by the disease (0.15)\n- n is the total number of people in the group (80)\n- k is the number of people affected by the disease\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 10 people being affected, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 10, 11, 12, ..., 80.\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9))\n\nCalculating the probabilities for k = 0 to 9 and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.0483\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 10 people being affected:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.0483 ≈ 0.9517\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 people are affected by the disease in a group of 80 people is approximately 0.9517 or 95.17%."
