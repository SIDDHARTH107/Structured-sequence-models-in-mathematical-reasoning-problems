    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to properly color this graph, we can use the concept of graph theory and the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 8 vertices, and each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices. This graph is known as a 3-regular graph. To find the chromatic number, we can use the following inequality:\n\nχ(G) ≥ (Δ(G) + 1) / 2\n\nwhere χ(G) is the chromatic number of the graph G, and Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the graph G. In this case, Δ(G) = 3, since each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices.\n\nUsing the inequality, we get:\n\nχ(G) ≥ (3 + 1) / 2\nχ(G) ≥ 4 / 2\nχ(G) ≥ 2\n\nSo, the chromatic number of the graph G is at least 2. However, we need to check if it is possible to color the graph with only 2 colors. If we try to color the graph with 2 colors, we will find that it is not possible to do so without having two adjacent vertices sharing the same color. This is because the graph contains cycles of odd length, which cannot be colored with just 2 colors.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to properly color this graph is 3."
