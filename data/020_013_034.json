    "message_2": "To minimize the function f(x) = x1 + 2x2 subject to the constraints x1^2 + 3x2^2 >= 1 and x1 + x2 = 1, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nLet L(x1, x2, λ, μ) = x1 + 2x2 + λ(x1^2 + 3x2^2 - 1) - μ(x1 + x2 - 1), where λ and μ are the Lagrange multipliers.\n\nNow we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x1, x2, λ, and μ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x1 = 1 + 2λx1 - μ = 0\n∂L/∂x2 = 2 + 6λx2 - μ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x1^2 + 3x2^2 - 1 = 0\n∂L/∂μ = x1 + x2 - 1 = 0\n\nFrom the last equation, we have x1 + x2 = 1. Since x1^2 + 3x2^2 >= 1, we can assume that the constraint x1^2 + 3x2^2 = 1 is active (otherwise, we could decrease x1 and x2 to make the objective function smaller). So, we have:\n\nx1^2 + 3x2^2 = 1\nx1 + x2 = 1\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations:\n\n1) 1 + 2λx1 - μ = 0\n2) 2 + 6λx2 - μ = 0\n3) x1^2 + 3x2^2 = 1\n4) x1 + x2 = 1\n\nFrom equation (4), we can express x1 as x1 = 1 - x2 and substitute it into equation (3):\n\n(1 - x2)^2 + 3x2^2 = 1\n1 - 2x2 + x2^2 + 3x2^2 = 1\n4x2^2 - 2x2 = 0\n2x2^2 - x2 = 0\nx2(2x2 - 1) = 0\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions: x2 = 0 or x2 = 1/2.\n\nIf x2 = 0, then x1 = 1, and the constraint x1^2 + 3x2^2 = 1 is satisfied. In this case, f(x) = 1.\n\nIf x2 = 1/2, then x1 = 1/2, and the constraint x1^2 + 3x2^2 = 1 is also satisfied. In this case, f(x) = 1/2 + 2(1/2) = 2.\n\nThus, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x1 + 2x2 subject to the constraints is f(x) = 1, which occurs at the point (x1, x2) = (1, 0)."
