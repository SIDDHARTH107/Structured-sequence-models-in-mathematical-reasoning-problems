    "message_2": "To find all solutions of the equation sin(2x) = 1/2 in the interval [0, 2π], we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation in terms of sin(x) using the double-angle formula for sine: sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n2. Set the equation equal to 1/2: 2sin(x)cos(x) = 1/2\n3. Solve for sin(x)cos(x): sin(x)cos(x) = 1/4\n4. Notice that sin(x)cos(x) is the product-to-sum formula: sin(x)cos(x) = (1/2)[sin(x + x) + sin(x - x)]\n5. Plug in the values: (1/2)[sin(2x) + sin(0)] = 1/4\n6. Since sin(0) = 0, the equation simplifies to: (1/2)sin(2x) = 1/4\n7. Solve for sin(2x): sin(2x) = 1/2\n8. Find the general solutions for 2x: 2x = π/6 + 2nπ and 2x = 5π/6 + 2nπ, where n is an integer.\n9. Solve for x: x = π/12 + nπ and x = 5π/12 + nπ\n10. Find all solutions in the interval [0, 2π]: x = π/12, 5π/12, 13π/12, and 17π/12.\n\nSo, the solutions of the equation sin(2x) = 1/2 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = π/12, 5π/12, 13π/12, and 17π/12."
