    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent value for the Lorenz system can be estimated numerically, as there is no closed-form expression for it. The Lorenz system is given by the following set of differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = sigma * (y - x)\ndy/dt = x * (rho - z) - y\ndz/dt = x * y - beta * z\n\nFor the given input parameters (sigma = 10, beta = 8/3, and rho = 28), the maximum Lyapunov exponent value is approximately 0.9056. This value indicates that the Lorenz system exhibits chaotic behavior for these parameters."
