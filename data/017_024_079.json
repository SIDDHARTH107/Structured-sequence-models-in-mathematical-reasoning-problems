Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the partition function: P(5) = 7, P(1) = 1, so there are 7 * 1 = 7 abelian groups.\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of a given order: G(n) = (1/n) * ∑(d|n) * μ(n/d) * P(d), where G(n) is the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n, d are the divisors of n, μ is the Möbius function, and P(d) is the partition function.\n\nApplying this formula to n = 96, we get:\n\nG(96) = (1/96) * [μ(1) * P(96) + μ(2) * P(48) + μ(3) * P(32) + μ(4) * P(24) + μ(6) * P(16) + μ(8) * P(12) + μ(12) * P(8) + μ(16) * P(6) + μ(24) * P(4) + μ(32) * P(3) + μ(48) * P(2) + μ(96) * P(1)]\n\nUsing the values of the Möbius function and partition function for the divisors of 96, we get:\n\nG(96) = (1/96) * [1 * 194 + (-1) * 28 + (-1) * 7 + 0 * 15 + 1 * 9 + 0 * 11 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 4 + (-1) * 3 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 1]\n\nG(96) = (1/96) * [194 - 28 - 7 + 9 + 4 + 1]\n\nG(96) = (1/96) * [173]\n\nG(96) = 1.802083 (approximately)\n\nSince the number of non-isomorphic groups must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer:\n\nG(96) = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
