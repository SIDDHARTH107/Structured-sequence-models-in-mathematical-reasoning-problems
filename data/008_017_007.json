    "message_2": "1. Express this system in matrix form using a sparse matrix.\n\nA sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the given system of linear equations does not have many zero elements. However, we can still represent it in matrix form (not necessarily sparse).\n\nThe matrix form of the given system is:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  5  7 |\n    | 5  2  8 |\n    | 6  7  9 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 12 |\n    | 14 |\n\n2. Solve the system using the sparse matrix method.\n\nSince the matrix A is not sparse, we will use the Gaussian elimination method to solve the system.\n\nFirst, we will convert the matrix A to its row echelon form:\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\nA = | 5  2  8 |\n    | 3  5  7 |\n    | 6  7  9 |\n\nStep 2: Subtract 3/5 of row 1 from row 2 and 6/5 of row 1 from row 3:\n\nA = |  5   2   8  |\n    |  0   4   1  |\n    |  0   5  -3  |\n\nStep 3: Divide row 2 by 4:\n\nA = |  5   2    8  |\n    |  0   1   1/4 |\n    |  0   5  -3  |\n\nStep 4: Subtract 2 times row 2 from row 1 and 5 times row 2 from row 3:\n\nA = |  5   0   6  |\n    |  0   1   1/4 |\n    |  0   0  -13/4 |\n\nNow, we have the row echelon form of matrix A. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = (-13/4)^(-1) * 14 = -14/(13/4) = -56/13\n\ny = 14 - 1/4 * z = 14 - 1/4 * (-56/13) = 14 + 14/13 = 196/13\n\nx = (10 - 6z - 2y) / 5 = (10 - 6*(-56/13) - 2*(196/13)) / 5 = (10 + 336/13 - 392/13) / 5 = (-46/13) / 5 = -46/65\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -46/65\ny = 196/13\nz = -56/13"
