    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and let B and C be the complements of set A. If B and C have no elements in common, what are the values of B and C?",
    "message_2": "To determine the values of B and C, we first need to know the universal set (U) that A, B, and C are subsets of. The complement of a set A (denoted as A') is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. Since B and C are both complements of A, they both contain all elements in the universal set that are not in A.\n\nHowever, the problem states that B and C have no elements in common. This is a contradiction, as both B and C should have the same elements, being complements of A. Therefore, it is not possible to find the values of B and C under the given conditions."
