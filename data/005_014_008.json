    "message_1": "A company wants to assess the factors that influence employee satisfaction in the workplace. They survey 100 employees and ask them to rate their satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10 for various factors such as salary, work-life balance, job security, and opportunities for growth. The company decides to perform a factor analysis to identify common underlying factors that explain the variance in employee satisfaction ratings. Based on the factor analysis results, they find that 60% of the variance can be explained by two underlying factors.\n\nWhat is the percentage of variance that cannot be explained by the two underlying factors identified in the factor analysis?",
    "message_2": "If 60% of the variance can be explained by the two underlying factors, then the percentage of variance that cannot be explained by these factors is 100% - 60% = 40%."
