    "message_2": "To determine if the sequence (xn) converges in X under the usual metric on X, we need to find if there exists a limit L in X such that for every ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, the distance between xn and L is less than ε.\n\nThe sequence (xn) is defined as xn = 1/n. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0. Therefore, we can hypothesize that the limit L is 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the usual metric on X, which is the absolute value of the difference between two elements. For any ε > 0, we need to find a natural number N such that for all n > N, |xn - L| < ε.\n\nSince xn = 1/n and L = 0, we have:\n\n|xn - L| = |1/n - 0| = |1/n|\n\nWe want to find N such that for all n > N, |1/n| < ε. We can rewrite this inequality as:\n\n1/n < ε\n\nNow, we can solve for n:\n\nn > 1/ε\n\nSince n is a natural number, we can choose N to be the smallest integer greater than 1/ε. Then, for all n > N, |1/n| < ε.\n\nThus, the sequence (xn) converges to 0 in X under the usual metric on X."
