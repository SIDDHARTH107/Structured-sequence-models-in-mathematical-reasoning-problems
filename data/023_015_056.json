    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the wave function, we first need to define the function f(x) piecewise:\n\nf(x) = { 2x for x ≤ 0\n         { 0  for x > 0\n\nThe Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-i*k*x)] dx\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), i is the imaginary unit, and k is the wave number.\n\nSince f(x) is a piecewise function, we need to compute the Fourier transform separately for each piece and then add them together. For the first piece (2x for x ≤ 0), the integral becomes:\n\nF1(k) = ∫[2x * e^(-i*k*x)] dx from -∞ to 0\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 2x and dv = e^(-i*k*x) dx\nThen du = 2 dx and v = (-1/(i*k)) * e^(-i*k*x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\nF1(k) = uv | from -∞ to 0 - ∫ v du\n\nF1(k) = (-2x/(i*k)) * e^(-i*k*x) | from -∞ to 0 - (-1/(i*k)) * ∫ e^(-i*k*x) * 2 dx\n\nNow, we can solve the remaining integral:\n\n∫ e^(-i*k*x) * 2 dx = (-2/(i*k)) * e^(-i*k*x) | from -∞ to 0\n\nPlugging this back into the integration by parts formula:\n\nF1(k) = (-2x/(i*k)) * e^(-i*k*x) | from -∞ to 0 - (-2/(i*k)) * (-2/(i*k)) * e^(-i*k*x) | from -∞ to 0\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nF1(k) = (2/(k^2)) * (1 - e^(i*k*0))\n\nSince e^(i*k*0) = 1, F1(k) simplifies to:\n\nF1(k) = 2/(k^2)\n\nFor the second piece (0 for x > 0), the integral is simply 0, as the function is multiplied by 0:\n\nF2(k) = ∫[0 * e^(-i*k*x)] dx from 0 to ∞\nF2(k) = 0\n\nNow, we can add F1(k) and F2(k) to find the total Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k) = 2/(k^2)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the wave function is F(k) = 2/(k^2).\n\nThe speed at which the wave is traveling is given in the problem statement as 300 m/s."
