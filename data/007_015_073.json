    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can inform you that the 50th Mersenne prime is not yet known. Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. As of now, only 51 Mersenne primes have been discovered, but they are not in consecutive order. The largest known Mersenne prime is 2^77,232,917 - 1, which is the 51st known Mersenne prime, but it doesn't mean that it's the 51st in the sequence. The search for Mersenne primes is ongoing, and new discoveries are made through collaborative efforts like the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)."
