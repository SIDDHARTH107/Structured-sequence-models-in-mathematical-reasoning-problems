    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given $100 to split with Player 2. Player 1 can choose to keep any amount between $0 and $100 and give the rest to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts, they both keep the money as decided. If Player 2 rejects, they both receive $0. What is the maximum amount that Player 1 can keep to guarantee that Player 2 will accept the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, Player 1 has complete control over the division of the $100, and Player 2 can only accept or reject the offer. To guarantee that Player 2 will accept the offer, Player 1 should offer an amount that is more than what Player 2 would get if they reject the offer, which is $0.\n\nIn this case, the maximum amount that Player 1 can keep to guarantee that Player 2 will accept the offer is $99, giving $1 to Player 2. This is because Player 2 would prefer to accept the $1 offer rather than rejecting it and receiving $0. However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical answer and in real-life situations, people may behave differently due to factors such as fairness and social norms."
