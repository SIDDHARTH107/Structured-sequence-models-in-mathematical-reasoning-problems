    "message_2": "A torus has several types of symmetries. In this case, with a major radius of 3 and a minor radius of 1, the torus has the following symmetries:\n\n1. Rotational symmetry: The torus can be rotated around its central axis (the axis passing through the center of the major circle) by any angle, and it will still look the same. This is a continuous symmetry.\n\n2. Translational symmetry: The torus has translational symmetry along the central axis. If you move the torus along this axis by a distance equal to the circumference of the major circle (2π * 3 = 6π), it will look the same.\n\n3. Reflection symmetry: The torus has reflection symmetry with respect to any plane that contains the central axis. If you reflect the torus across such a plane, it will look the same.\n\n4. Helical symmetry: The torus has helical symmetry along the central axis. If you rotate the torus around this axis by any angle and simultaneously translate it along the axis by a distance proportional to the angle of rotation, it will look the same. This is another continuous symmetry.\n\nIn summary, the torus with a major radius of 3 and a minor radius of 1 has rotational, translational, reflection, and helical symmetries."
