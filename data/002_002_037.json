    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSince the diameter of the spherical water tank is 5 meters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 2.5 meters.\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(2.5)^3\n\nV ≈ (4/3) * 3.14159 * 15.625\n\nV ≈ 65.4498 * 3.14159\n\nV ≈ 205.9153 cubic meters\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the volume of water that the tank can hold is approximately 205.92 cubic meters."
