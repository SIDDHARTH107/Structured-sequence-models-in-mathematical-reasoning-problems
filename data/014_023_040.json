    "message_2": "To decrypt a message encrypted with the rail fence cipher, we need to arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with the specified key (in this case, 4) as the number of rows. Then, we read the message row by row. Let's arrange the given encrypted message `TMTTEEHPREOOWSRAAFNYSIIGSNA` with a key of 4:\n\n```\nT     M     T\n  T  E  H  P  R\n    E  O  W  S\n      R  A  A  F  N  Y  S  I  I  G  S  N  A\n```\n\nNow, let's read the message row by row:\n\n`TMT` + `TEHPRE` + `EOWS` + `RAAFNYSIIGSNA`\n\nThe original message is: `TMTTEHPREEOWSRAAFNYSIIGSNA`."
