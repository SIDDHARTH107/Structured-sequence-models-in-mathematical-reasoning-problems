    "message_1": "Suppose a market research conducted a survey to determine the probability that a consumer will purchase a new electronic gadget product. The results of the survey showed that 75% of consumers are likely to purchase a new electronic gadget product. If there are 200 consumers in the market, how many of them are likely to purchase the new electronic gadget product?",
    "message_2": "To find out how many consumers are likely to purchase the new electronic gadget product, we can multiply the total number of consumers by the probability of purchasing the product.\n\nTotal consumers = 200\nProbability of purchasing = 75% = 0.75\n\nNumber of consumers likely to purchase = 200 * 0.75 = 150\n\nSo, 150 consumers are likely to purchase the new electronic gadget product."
