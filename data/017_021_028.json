    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we will use the Sylow Theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. \n\nLet G be a group of order 48. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 16 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 or 3\n2. n_3 = 1 or 4\n\nWe will now analyze these possibilities:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 16 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. The order of P_2 * P_3 is |P_2| * |P_3| = 16 * 3 = 48, which is the order of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is C_16 × C_3. Since C_16 × C_3 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_48, we have one possibility: G ≅ C_48.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 16 and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. The group G acts on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation, and this action gives rise to a homomorphism from G to S_4. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups, and the image is a subgroup of S_4. Since P_2 is normal in G, it is contained in the kernel. Therefore, the image of the homomorphism has order 3 or 6. If the image has order 3, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_2 and a group of order 3, which is C_16 ⋊ C_3. If the image has order 6, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_2 and a group of order 6, which is C_16 ⋊ C_6. However, C_16 ⋊ C_6 is isomorphic to the direct product A_4 × C_4, so we have another possibility: G ≅ A_4 × C_4.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. The group G acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation, and this action gives rise to a homomorphism from G to S_3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups, and the image is a subgroup of S_3. Since P_3 is normal in G, it is contained in the kernel. Therefore, the image of the homomorphism has order 2 or 4. If the image has order 2, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_3 and a group of order 2, which is C_3 ⋊ C_2. If the image has order 4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_3 and a group of order 4, which is C_3 ⋊ C_4. However, C_3 ⋊ C_2 and C_3 ⋊ C_4 are both abelian, and they are isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 and the direct product C_3 × C_4, respectively. Since these groups have orders less than 48, they cannot be isomorphic to G.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. There is no normal Sylow subgroup in this case, so G must be non-abelian. There are two non-abelian groups of order 48 that satisfy these conditions: the semidirect product C_16 ⋊ C_3 and the semidirect product C_16 ⋊ C_6. However, as we saw in Case 2, the semidirect product C_16 ⋊ C_6 is isomorphic to the direct product A_4 × C_4. Therefore, we have one more possibility: G ≅ C_16 ⋊ C_3.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three non-isomorphic groups of order 48: the cyclic group C_48, the direct product A_4 × C_4, and the semidirect product C_16 ⋊ C_3. Every group of order 48 is isomorphic to one of these groups."
