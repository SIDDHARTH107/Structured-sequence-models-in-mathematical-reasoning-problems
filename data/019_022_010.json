There is a 70% chance that the student will enjoy Mathematics, and a 90% chance that they will enjoy Computer Science. If the student chooses Mathematics, there is a 60% chance they will graduate with honors, and if they choose Computer Science, there is an 80% chance they will graduate with honors. Considering only the chance of graduating with honors, which major should the student choose?",
