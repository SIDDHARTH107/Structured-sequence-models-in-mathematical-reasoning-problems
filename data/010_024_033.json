    "message_2": "A right-angled hyperbolic triangle has angles A, B, and C, where A and B are acute angles, C is a right angle (90 degrees), and the sides opposite to these angles are a, b, and c, respectively. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a right-angled triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = (π/2) - (A + B)\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is equal to π (180 degrees) in hyperbolic geometry, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nArea = (π/2) - (π - C)\nArea = C - (π/2)\n\nGiven that the area of the triangle is 20 square units, we have:\n\n20 = C - (π/2)\n\nHowever, this equation does not have a solution for integer sides a, b, and c, because the area of a right-angled hyperbolic triangle depends on the angles, not the side lengths. Furthermore, the area is expressed in terms of π, which is an irrational number, making it impossible to find integer side lengths that would result in an area of 20 square units.\n\nTherefore, there are no right-angled hyperbolic triangles with integer sides that have an area of 20 square units."
