    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nSince the two equations are the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n3y = 7 - 2x\ny = (7 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow we have a general solution for the system:\n\ny = (7 - 2x) / 3\n\nFor any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y that satisfies the system of equations."
