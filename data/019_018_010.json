    "message_2": "Let's consider two odd integers, a and b. By definition, an odd integer can be represented as 2n + 1, where n is an integer. So, we can represent a and b as follows:\n\na = 2n1 + 1\nb = 2n2 + 1\n\nNow, let's find the sum of a and b:\n\na + b = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1)\n\nUsing the distributive property, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\na + b = 2n1 + 2n2 + 1 + 1\n\nNow, we can factor out the common factor of 2:\n\na + b = 2(n1 + n2) + 2\n\nSince n1 and n2 are integers, their sum (n1 + n2) is also an integer. Let's represent this sum as another integer, k:\n\na + b = 2k + 2\n\nNow, we can factor out the common factor of 2 again:\n\na + b = 2(k + 1)\n\nSince k is an integer, (k + 1) is also an integer. Let's represent (k + 1) as another integer, m:\n\na + b = 2m\n\nBy definition, an even integer can be represented as 2 times an integer. In this case, the sum of the two odd integers a and b is represented as 2 times the integer m, which means that the sum of any two odd integers is an even integer."
