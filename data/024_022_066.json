    "message_2": "To find the isometries of the given metric, we need to find all transformations that preserve the metric. In other words, we need to find transformations T(x, y) = (x', y') such that the metric remains unchanged:\n\nds'^2 = 4(dx')^2 + (dy')^2 = 4(dx)^2 + (dy)^2\n\nLet's consider the following types of transformations:\n\n1. Translations: T(x, y) = (x + a, y + b), where a and b are constants.\n   In this case, dx' = dx and dy' = dy, so the metric remains unchanged:\n\n   ds'^2 = 4(dx')^2 + (dy')^2 = 4(dx)^2 + (dy)^2 = ds^2\n\n   Therefore, translations are isometries of the given metric.\n\n2. Rotations: T(x, y) = (x*cos(θ) - y*sin(θ), x*sin(θ) + y*cos(θ)), where θ is a constant.\n   In this case, we have:\n\n   dx' = -x*sin(θ)dx + x*cos(θ)dy - y*cos(θ)dx - y*sin(θ)dy\n   dy' = x*cos(θ)dx + x*sin(θ)dy + y*sin(θ)dx + y*cos(θ)dy\n\n   Now, we compute the metric:\n\n   ds'^2 = 4(dx')^2 + (dy')^2\n         = 4((-x*sin(θ)dx + x*cos(θ)dy)^2 + (-y*cos(θ)dx - y*sin(θ)dy)^2) + (x*cos(θ)dx + x*sin(θ)dy + y*sin(θ)dx + y*cos(θ)dy)^2\n\n   After expanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n   ds'^2 = 4(dx)^2 + (dy)^2 = ds^2\n\n   Therefore, rotations are also isometries of the given metric.\n\n3. Scaling: T(x, y) = (kx, ly), where k and l are constants.\n   In this case, dx' = k*dx and dy' = l*dy, so the metric becomes:\n\n   ds'^2 = 4(k*dx)^2 + (l*dy)^2 = 4k^2(dx)^2 + l^2(dy)^2\n\n   For the metric to remain unchanged, we must have 4k^2 = 4 and l^2 = 1. This implies k = ±1 and l = ±1. Therefore, only reflections (i.e., scaling with k = -1 or l = -1) are isometries of the given metric.\n\nIn conclusion, the isometries of the given metric are translations, rotations, and reflections."
