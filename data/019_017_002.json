    "message_2": "To show that T has a model of size 𝑛 for every cardinal 𝑛 ≥ ℵ₀, we will use the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. The Löwenheim-Skolem theorem states that if a countable theory has an infinite model, then it has a model of every infinite cardinality.\n\nFirst, let's recall the axioms of the theory T of dense linear orders without endpoints:\n\n1. ∀x (x = x) (reflexivity)\n2. ∀x∀y (x = y → y = x) (symmetry)\n3. ∀x∀y∀z (x = y ∧ y = z → x = z) (transitivity)\n4. ∀x∀y (x = y ∨ x < y ∨ y < x) (trichotomy)\n5. ∀x∀y∀z (x < y ∧ y < z → x < z) (transitivity of <)\n6. ∀x∀y (x < y → ¬(y < x)) (asymmetry of <)\n7. ∀x∀y (x < y → ∃z (x < z ∧ z < y)) (density)\n8. ¬∃x (∀y (x < y ∨ x = y)) (no minimum)\n9. ¬∃x (∀y (y < x ∨ y = x)) (no maximum)\n\nNow, we will show that T has an infinite model. Consider the set of rational numbers Q with the usual order <. We can see that Q satisfies all the axioms of T:\n\n1. Reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity are satisfied by the equality relation on Q.\n2. Trichotomy holds for the order relation on Q.\n3. Transitivity of < holds for the order relation on Q.\n4. Asymmetry of < holds for the order relation on Q.\n5. Density holds for the order relation on Q since between any two distinct rational numbers, we can find another rational number.\n6. Q has no minimum or maximum element.\n\nThus, Q is a model of T, and T has an infinite model.\n\nNow, we can apply the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. Since T is a countable theory (it has a finite number of axioms, each of which is a first-order formula with a finite number of symbols), and it has an infinite model (Q), the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem implies that T has a model of size 𝑛 for every cardinal 𝑛 ≥ ℵ₀."
