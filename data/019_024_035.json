    "message_2": "Let the two integers be x and y. We are given the following information:\n\n1. x + y = 25\n2. x * y = 120\n\nWe can rearrange the first equation to get y = 25 - x. Now, we can substitute this expression for y in the second equation:\n\nx * (25 - x) = 120\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n25x - x^2 = 120\n\nRearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 25x + 120 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 20) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = 5 or x = 20\n\nIf x = 5, then y = 25 - 5 = 20.\nIf x = 20, then y = 25 - 20 = 5.\n\nSo, the two integers are 5 and 20."
