    "message_1": "A toy factory claims that the average weight of their stuffed animals is 1.5 pounds. A concerned customer takes a random sample of 25 stuffed animals, and finds that the average weight is only 1.2 pounds, with a standard deviation of 0.2 pounds. Can the customer conclude with 95% confidence that the average weight of the stuffed animals produced by this factory is less than 1.5 pounds?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the customer can conclude with 95% confidence that the average weight of the stuffed animals produced by this factory is less than 1.5 pounds, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 1.5 (The average weight of the stuffed animals is 1.5 pounds)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ < 1.5 (The average weight of the stuffed animals is less than 1.5 pounds)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic.\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √sample size)\nt = (1.2 - 1.5) / (0.2 / √25)\nt = (-0.3) / (0.2 / 5)\nt = -0.3 / 0.04\nt = -7.5\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value.\nFor a one-tailed t-test with a 95% confidence level and 24 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1), the critical value is -1.711.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value.\nSince the test statistic (-7.5) is less than the critical value (-1.711), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThe customer can conclude with 95% confidence that the average weight of the stuffed animals produced by this factory is less than 1.5 pounds."
