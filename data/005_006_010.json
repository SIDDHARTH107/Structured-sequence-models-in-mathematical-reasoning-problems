    "message_1": "A clothing factory produces shirts with a mean weight of 250 grams and a standard deviation of 10 grams. If a sample of 100 shirts is randomly selected, what is the probability that the average weight of the sample is between 248 and 252 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 250 grams, the population standard deviation (σ) is 10 grams, and the sample size (n) is 100 shirts.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean):\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\nσ_sample_mean = 10 / √100\nσ_sample_mean = 10 / 10\nσ_sample_mean = 1 gram\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the range (248 and 252 grams, respectively):\n\nz_lower = (x_lower - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz_lower = (248 - 250) / 1\nz_lower = -2\n\nz_upper = (x_upper - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz_upper = (252 - 250) / 1\nz_upper = 2\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability between these z-scores. The probability of a z-score being between -2 and 2 is approximately 0.9544, or 95.44%.\n\nSo, there is a 95.44% probability that the average weight of the sample of 100 shirts is between 248 and 252 grams."
