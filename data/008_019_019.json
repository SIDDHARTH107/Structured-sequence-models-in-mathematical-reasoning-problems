    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the system of equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n| 1   2i  -3 | | x |   | 1 - i |\n| 3  -1   2+i | | y | = | 3 + 2i|\n| 2  1-i   2 | | z |   |  2i   |\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Multiply the first row by 3 and subtract it from the second row:\n\n```\n| 1   2i  -3 | | x |   | 1 - i |\n| 0  -1-6i 11 | | y | = | 2 + 5i|\n| 2  1-i   2 | | z |   |  2i   |\n```\n\n2. Multiply the first row by 2 and subtract it from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1   2i  -3 | | x |   | 1 - i |\n| 0  -1-6i 11 | | y | = | 2 + 5i|\n| 0  -3+3i  8 | | z |   |  4i   |\n```\n\n3. Multiply the second row by (-1-6i)/(-3+3i) and add it to the third row:\n\n```\n| 1   2i  -3 | | x |   | 1 - i |\n| 0  -1-6i 11 | | y | = | 2 + 5i|\n| 0   0   2+8i| | z |   |  4+12i|\n```\n\nNow, we can solve the system using back-substitution:\n\n1. Divide the third row by (2+8i):\n\n```\nz = (4+12i)/(2+8i)\n```\n\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n```\nz = ((4+12i)(2-8i))/((2+8i)(2-8i)) = (32+96i)/68 = (16+48i)/34 = 8/17 + (24/17)i\n```\n\n2. Substitute z into the second row and solve for y:\n\n```\ny = -1 - 6i - 11(8/17 + (24/17)i)\ny = -1 - 6i - (88/17 + (264/17)i)\ny = (-1 - 88/17) - (6 + 264/17)i\ny = (-105/17) - (138/17)i\n```\n\n3. Substitute y and z into the first row and solve for x:\n\n```\nx = 1 - i - 2i(-105/17 - (138/17)i) + 3(8/17 + (24/17)i)\nx = 1 - i + (210/17 + 276/17i) + (24/17 + 72/17i)\nx = (1 + 210/17 + 24/17) + (-1 + 276/17 + 72/17)i\nx = (251/17) + (347/17)i\n```\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 251/17 + 347/17i\ny = -105/17 - 138/17i\nz = 8/17 + 24/17i\n```"
