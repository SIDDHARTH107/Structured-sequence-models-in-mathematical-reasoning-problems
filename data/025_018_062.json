    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension 2 defined over the field of complex numbers. Let L be a line bundle over X and consider the rational map π: X --> Y associated to the complete linear system |\\mbox{m}L|. Suppose that π is a morphism and that Y is a normal variety. If the general fiber of π is isomorphic to P^1, then prove that Y is also isomorphic to P^1.\n\nNow, a specific numerical problem based on this could be:\n\nLet X = P^2 be the complex projective plane and L be the line bundle \\mathcal{O}(d) for some positive integer d. Assume that π: X --> Y is a morphism and that Y is a normal variety. If the general fiber of π is isomorphic to P^1 and d ≥ 2, what is the possible range of values for the degree of Y?",
    "message_2": "Proof that Y is isomorphic to P^1:\n\nSince the general fiber of π is isomorphic to P^1, we have that the fibers of π are one-dimensional. By the theorem on the dimension of fibers, we have that dim(Y) = dim(X) - dim(Fiber) = 2 - 1 = 1. Thus, Y is a one-dimensional projective variety. Since Y is normal, it is also smooth. Therefore, Y is a smooth projective curve, which implies that Y is isomorphic to P^1.\n\nNow, let's find the possible range of values for the degree of Y:\n\nLet X = P^2 be the complex projective plane and L be the line bundle \\mathcal{O}(d) for some positive integer d. Since the general fiber of π is isomorphic to P^1, the morphism π is a d-to-1 map. The degree of Y can be computed as the degree of the pushforward of the line bundle L under the morphism π, which is given by π_*L = \\mathcal{O}(d).\n\nThe degree of Y is the degree of the divisor associated to the line bundle π_*L, which is the intersection number of the divisor with a generic line in Y. Since Y is isomorphic to P^1, we can compute this intersection number in P^1. Let H be the hyperplane class in P^1, then the degree of Y is given by the intersection number (π_*L . H) = d * (H . H) = d.\n\nSince d ≥ 2, the possible range of values for the degree of Y is all integers greater than or equal to 2."
