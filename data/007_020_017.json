Compute the value of Φ(PQ), where Φ is the Euler totient function.\n   Φ(PQ) = Φ(7) * Φ(11) = (7-1) * (11-1) = 6 * 10 = 60\n\n3. Choose an encryption exponent e that is relatively prime to Φ(PQ) and less than Φ(PQ).\n   Let's choose e = 13, as it is relatively prime to 60 (their greatest common divisor is 1) and less than 60.\n\n4. Compute the decryption exponent d using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n   We need to find d such that (e * d) % Φ(PQ) = 1.\n   Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that d = 37, as (13 * 37) % 60 = 1.\n\n5. Encrypt the message m = 5 using the public key (PQ, e).\n   The encryption function is c = m^e % PQ.\n   So, c = 5^13 % 77 = 71\n\n6. Decrypt the ciphertext using the private key (PQ, d) to reveal the original message.\n   The decryption function is m = c^d % PQ.\n   So, m = 71^37 % 77 = 5\n\nThe original message is 5, as expected."
