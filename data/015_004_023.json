    "message_2": "Calculating the exact perimeter length of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is a difficult task due to the fractal nature of the set. The Mandelbrot set is a collection of complex numbers that do not diverge when iterated through the equation Zn+1 = Zn² + c, with Z0 = 0.\n\nThe main cardioid is the largest, heart-shaped region in the Mandelbrot set. Its equation can be given in polar coordinates as:\n\nc = r * e^(i * θ) = (1 - cos(θ)) * e^(i * θ)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the origin, θ is the angle, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the main cardioid, we can use the arc length formula for polar coordinates:\n\nL = ∫(√(r^2 + (dr/dθ)^2)) dθ\n\nHowever, due to the fractal nature of the Mandelbrot set, the perimeter is not well-defined, as it contains an infinite number of smaller and smaller details. As a result, it is not possible to provide an exact value for the perimeter length of the main cardioid."
