    "message_2": "A group of order 77 has the order as the product of two distinct prime factors, 7 and 11. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group can be expressed as the direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nSince 7 and 11 are distinct prime factors, the structure of the group of order 77 can be expressed as the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7 and 11, respectively. In other words, the group is isomorphic to the group Z_7 Ã— Z_11, where Z_n denotes the cyclic group of order n."
