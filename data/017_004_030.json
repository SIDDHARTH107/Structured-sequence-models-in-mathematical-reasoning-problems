    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 49. Since 49 is a prime power (49 = 7^2), we can apply the Sylow Theorems to G. In particular, we know that the number of Sylow 7-subgroups of G, denoted by n_7, must divide the order of G and must be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility for n_7 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup of G, say H.\n\nSince H is the unique Sylow 7-subgroup of G, it must be a normal subgroup of G. Now, let's consider the order of H. Since H is a Sylow 7-subgroup, its order must be 7^k for some k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 (because the order of G is 7^2). If k = 2, then the order of H is 49, which means H = G, and G is a cyclic group of order 49.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when k = 1. In this case, the order of H is 7, and H is a cyclic group of order 7. Let x be a generator of H, so H = ⟨x⟩. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is (order of G)/(order of H) = 49/7 = 7, so G/H is a cyclic group of order 7. Let yH be a generator of G/H, where y is an element of G.\n\nNow, consider the element (x, y) in the direct product group H × G/H. The order of (x, y) is the least common multiple of the orders of x and yH, which are both 7. Therefore, the order of (x, y) is 7, and ⟨(x, y)⟩ is a cyclic group of order 7. Moreover, since the orders of H and G/H are coprime, the direct product H × G/H is isomorphic to the internal direct product H * G/H by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group has an order of 49, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7."
