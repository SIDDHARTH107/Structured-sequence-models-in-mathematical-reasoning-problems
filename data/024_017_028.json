    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve C, we need to find the covariant derivative of v with respect to t, and then set it to zero. This will ensure that the vector remains parallel to the curve as it moves along it.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C by taking the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nT(t) = r'(t) = (-sin t)i + (cos t)j + k\n\nNow, let's find the covariant derivative of v with respect to t:\n\nDv/Dt = (dv/dt) + (v • ∇)T\n\nSince v is a constant vector, its derivative with respect to t is zero:\n\ndv/dt = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the dot product of v and the gradient operator ∇:\n\nv • ∇ = (2i - j + k) • (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z) = 2∂/∂x - ∂/∂y + ∂/∂z\n\nNow, let's apply this operator to the tangent vector T:\n\n(v • ∇)T = 2∂(-sin t)/∂x - ∂(cos t)/∂y + ∂(1)/∂z = 0\n\nSince the covariant derivative Dv/Dt is zero, the vector v remains parallel to the curve C as it moves along it. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve C is simply the vector v itself:\n\nv_parallel = 2i - j + k"
