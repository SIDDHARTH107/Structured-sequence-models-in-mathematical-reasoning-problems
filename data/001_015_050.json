    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that allows us to isolate x. We can do this by expressing both sides of the equation with the same base. Since 4 and 32 are both powers of 2, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n4^(x+1) = 32\n(2^2)^(x+1) = 2^5\n\nNow, using the power of a power rule (a^(mn) = a^(m*n)), we can simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n2^(2(x+1)) = 2^5\n\nSince the bases are equal (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2(x+1) = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x + 2 = 5\n2x = 3\nx = 3/2\n\nSo, x = 1.5."
