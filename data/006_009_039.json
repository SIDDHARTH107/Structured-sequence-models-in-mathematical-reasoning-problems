    "message_1": "In a population of 10,000 individuals, 100 have a certain medical condition. What is the probability that a randomly selected individual has this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected individual has the medical condition, we need to divide the number of individuals with the condition by the total population.\n\nNumber of individuals with the condition = 100\nTotal population = 10,000\n\nProbability = (Number of individuals with the condition) / (Total population)\nProbability = 100 / 10,000\nProbability = 0.01 or 1%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected individual has the medical condition is 1%."
