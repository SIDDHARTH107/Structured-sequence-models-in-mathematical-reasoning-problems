    "message_1": "Consider a message encrypted using a substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet is replaced with another letter. In a particular message, the letter \"A\" appears 20 times, \"B\" appears 10 times, \"C\" appears 15 times, and all other letters appear less than 10 times. Assuming that the message is written in English, which letter is most likely to correspond to \"A\" in the encryption key?",
    "message_2": "In the English language, the most frequently used letter is \"E.\" Since \"A\" appears the most frequently in the encrypted message (20 times), it is most likely that \"A\" corresponds to \"E\" in the encryption key."
