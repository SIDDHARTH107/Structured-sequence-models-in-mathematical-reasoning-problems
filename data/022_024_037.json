Find an explicit solution for $u(x,y,t)$ using the method of Fourier transforms.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using Fourier transforms, we first take the Fourier transform of the equation with respect to both x and y variables. Let's denote the Fourier transform of u(x, y, t) as U(k_x, k_y, t). Then, the Fourier transform of the heat equation is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} = -(k_x^2 + k_y^2)U$$\n\nNow, we solve this ordinary differential equation (ODE) for U. This is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is given by:\n\n$$U(k_x, k_y, t) = U(k_x, k_y, 0)e^{-(k_x^2 + k_y^2)t}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the initial condition for U, which is the Fourier transform of the given initial condition:\n\n$$U(k_x, k_y, 0) = \\mathcal{F}\\{1 + x + iy\\}$$\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of each term separately, we get:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{1\\} = \\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y)$$\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{x\\} = -i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x}\\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y)$$\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{iy\\} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_y}\\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y)$$\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the initial condition is:\n\n$$U(k_x, k_y, 0) = \\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y) - i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x}\\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_y}\\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y)$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the solution for U:\n\n$$U(k_x, k_y, t) = \\left[\\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y) - i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x}\\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_y}\\delta(k_x)\\delta(k_y)\\right]e^{-(k_x^2 + k_y^2)t}$$\n\nFinally, we take the inverse Fourier transform of U to obtain the solution for u(x, y, t):\n\n$$u(x, y, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{U(k_x, k_y, t)\\}$$\n\nUsing the convolution theorem and the properties of the delta function, we find:\n\n$$u(x, y, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi t}\\left[e^{-(x^2+y^2)/4t} - x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}e^{-(x^2+y^2)/4t} - y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}e^{-(x^2+y^2)/4t}\\right]$$\n\nThis is the explicit solution for u(x, y, t) using the method of Fourier transforms."
