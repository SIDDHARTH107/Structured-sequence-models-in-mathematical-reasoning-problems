    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, and let A be a subset of U such that A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Find the complement of set A, and then find the union of set A and its complement. Verify that the result is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', can be found by subtracting the elements of A from U:\n\nA' = U - A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements of both sets. In this case, the union of A and A' is:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nWe can see that the result of the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U\n\nThus, we have verified that the union of set A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
