    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student studying Bayesian statistics:\n\nSuppose that a certain disease occurs in 2% of the population. A test for the disease has a sensitivity of 90% (meaning that it correctly identifies 90% of people who have the disease) and a specificity of 95% (meaning that it correctly identifies 95% of people who do not have the disease). If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that a person has the disease (A) given that they tested positive (B). We are given the following information:\n\n- P(A) = 0.02 (2% of the population has the disease)\n- P(B|A) = 0.90 (sensitivity, or the probability of testing positive given that a person has the disease)\n- P(not A) = 0.98 (98% of the population does not have the disease)\n- P(B|not A) = 0.05 (1 - specificity, or the probability of testing positive given that a person does not have the disease)\n\nNow we need to find P(B), the probability of testing positive. We can do this using the law of total probability:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\n\nP(B) = (0.90 * 0.02) + (0.05 * 0.98)\nP(B) = 0.018 + 0.049\nP(B) = 0.067\n\nNow we can apply Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nP(A|B) = (0.90 * 0.02) / 0.067\nP(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2687\n\nSo, the probability that a person actually has the disease given that they tested positive is approximately 26.87%."
