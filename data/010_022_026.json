What is the maximum possible diameter of a small sphere that can be placed on top of the larger sphere such that it touches the top of the cylindrical cup and the larger sphere at the same time?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the radius of the smaller sphere as r. When the smaller sphere is placed on top of the larger sphere and touches the top of the cylindrical cup, it forms a right triangle with the radii of the two spheres and the distance between their centers as its sides.\n\nThe distance between the centers of the two spheres is equal to the sum of their radii (5 + r). The height of the cylindrical cup is 10 cm, and since the larger sphere has a radius of 5 cm, the distance from the top of the larger sphere to the top of the cylindrical cup is also 5 cm.\n\nNow, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle formed by the radii of the two spheres and the distance between their centers:\n\n(5 + r)^2 = 5^2 + r^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n25 + 10r + r^2 = 25 + r^2\n\n10r = 25\n\nr = 2.5 cm\n\nThe maximum possible diameter of the smaller sphere is twice its radius, which is:\n\n2 * 2.5 cm = 5 cm"
