    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^3 + 2x^2) * (5x - 7) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together:\n\nu(x) = x^3 + 2x^2\nv(x) = 5x - 7\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(u(x))/dx = d(x^3 + 2x^2)/dx = 3x^2 + 4x\nv'(x) = d(v(x))/dx = d(5x - 7)/dx = 5\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is given by:\n\nd(uv)/dx = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x) into the product rule formula, we get:\n\nf'(x) = (3x^2 + 4x)(5x - 7) + (x^3 + 2x^2)(5)\n\nNow, we expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (15x^3 - 21x^2 + 20x^2 - 28x) + (5x^3 + 10x^2)\nf'(x) = 15x^3 - 21x^2 + 20x^2 - 28x + 5x^3 + 10x^2\nf'(x) = (15x^3 + 5x^3) + (-21x^2 + 20x^2 + 10x^2) - 28x\nf'(x) = 20x^3 + 9x^2 - 28x\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^3 + 2x^2) * (5x - 7) using the product rule is:\n\nf'(x) = 20x^3 + 9x^2 - 28x"
