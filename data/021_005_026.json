    "message_2": "To solve the given ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the 2nd order Runge-Kutta method, we first need to define the function f(t, y) representing the ODE:\n\nf(t, y) = -2y + 1\n\nNow, let's implement the 2nd order Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.2 on the interval [0, 1]. We will start with the initial condition y(0) = 3.\n\nThe 2nd order Runge-Kutta method is given by the following formulas:\n\nk1 = h * f(t, y)\nk2 = h * f(t + h/2, y + k1/2)\ny_new = y + k2\n\nWe will apply this method iteratively to find the approximate value of y(1).\n\nStep 1 (t = 0, y = 3):\nk1 = 0.2 * f(0, 3) = 0.2 * (-2 * 3 + 1) = -1.0\nk2 = 0.2 * f(0 + 0.2/2, 3 - 1.0/2) = 0.2 * f(0.1, 2.5) = 0.2 * (-2 * 2.5 + 1) = -0.8\ny_new = 3 - 0.8 = 2.2\n\nStep 2 (t = 0.2, y = 2.2):\nk1 = 0.2 * f(0.2, 2.2) = 0.2 * (-2 * 2.2 + 1) = -0.84\nk2 = 0.2 * f(0.2 + 0.2/2, 2.2 - 0.84/2) = 0.2 * f(0.3, 1.78) = 0.2 * (-2 * 1.78 + 1) = -0.672\ny_new = 2.2 - 0.672 = 1.528\n\nStep 3 (t = 0.4, y = 1.528):\nk1 = 0.2 * f(0.4, 1.528) = 0.2 * (-2 * 1.528 + 1) = -0.7056\nk2 = 0.2 * f(0.4 + 0.2/2, 1.528 - 0.7056/2) = 0.2 * f(0.5, 1.1752) = 0.2 * (-2 * 1.1752 + 1) = -0.5504\ny_new = 1.528 - 0.5504 = 0.9776\n\nStep 4 (t = 0.6, y = 0.9776):\nk1 = 0.2 * f(0.6, 0.9776) = 0.2 * (-2 * 0.9776 + 1) = -0.3552\nk2 = 0.2 * f(0.6 + 0.2/2, 0.9776 - 0.3552/2) = 0.2 * f(0.7, 0.8) = 0.2 * (-2 * 0.8 + 1) = -0.32\ny_new = 0.9776 - 0.32 = 0.6576\n\nStep 5 (t = 0.8, y = 0.6576):\nk1 = 0.2 * f(0.8, 0.6576) = 0.2 * (-2 * 0.6576 + 1) = -0.13152\nk2 = 0.2 * f(0.8 + 0.2/2, 0.6576 - 0.13152/2) = 0.2 * f(0.9, 0.59184) = 0.2 * (-2 * 0.59184 + 1) = -0.18336\ny_new = 0.6576 - 0.18336 = 0.47424\n\nThus, the approximate numerical solution for y(1) is 0.47424."
