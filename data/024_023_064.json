    "message_1": "Let M be a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with the metric tensor g. Suppose M has a symmetry given by the Killing vector field K = x∂y - y∂x, where x and y are the standard coordinates on R^2. Determine the metric tensor g explicitly, assuming that the metric is given in the standard coordinates as g = f(x,y)dx^2 + g(x,y)dy^2, and that the manifold is simply connected.",
    "message_2": "To determine the metric tensor g explicitly, we will use the Killing equation, which states that for a Killing vector field K, the Lie derivative of the metric tensor g with respect to K is zero:\n\nL_K g = 0\n\nHere, L_K is the Lie derivative with respect to the Killing vector field K. The Lie derivative of a tensor can be computed using the following formula:\n\nL_K g = K^i ∂_i g + g_i^j ∂_j K^i + g^i_j ∂_i K^j\n\nNow, let's compute the Lie derivative of the metric tensor g with respect to K:\n\nL_K g = (x∂y - y∂x)(f(x,y)dx^2 + g(x,y)dy^2)\n\nWe can compute the Lie derivative component-wise:\n\nL_K g_xx = x∂y(f) - y∂x(f) = 0\nL_K g_yy = x∂y(g) - y∂x(g) = 0\n\nThese equations give us two partial differential equations for f(x, y) and g(x, y):\n\nx∂y(f) - y∂x(f) = 0\nx∂y(g) - y∂x(g) = 0\n\nWe can solve these equations using the method of characteristics. For the first equation, we have:\n\ndf / (x∂y(f) - y∂x(f)) = dx / x = dy / y\n\nIntegrating the first equation, we get:\n\nln(f) = ln(x^2 + y^2) + C_1\nf(x, y) = C_1(x^2 + y^2)\n\nSimilarly, integrating the second equation, we get:\n\nln(g) = ln(x^2 + y^2) + C_2\ng(x, y) = C_2(x^2 + y^2)\n\nNow, we can write the metric tensor g explicitly:\n\ng = f(x, y)dx^2 + g(x, y)dy^2 = C_1(x^2 + y^2)dx^2 + C_2(x^2 + y^2)dy^2\n\nHere, C_1 and C_2 are constants that depend on the specific Riemannian manifold M."
