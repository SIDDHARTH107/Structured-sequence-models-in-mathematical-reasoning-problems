    "message_2": "To determine the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(5)³\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(125)\n\nVolume = (500/3)π\n\nVolume ≈ 523.6 cubic centimeters\n\nTherefore, the volume of the sphere is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
