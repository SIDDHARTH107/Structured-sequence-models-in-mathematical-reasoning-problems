    "message_2": "To find the dominant frequencies of the stock index using Fourier analysis, we need to look at the terms in the function f(t) and identify the frequencies associated with each term. The function is given by:\n\nf(t) = 2cos(2πt) + 3sin(4πt) + √5cos(6πt)\n\nHere, we have three terms, each with a different frequency:\n\n1. 2cos(2πt): The frequency is 2π (in radians) or 1 cycle per time unit.\n2. 3sin(4πt): The frequency is 4π (in radians) or 2 cycles per time unit.\n3. √5cos(6πt): The frequency is 6π (in radians) or 3 cycles per time unit.\n\nSo, the three dominant frequencies of the stock index are 1, 2, and 3 cycles per time unit."
