    "message_2": "The fractal dimension (D) of a self-similar curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the self-similarity ratio.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, it is composed of 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4) and has a self-similarity ratio of 1/3 (S = 1/3).\n\nSo, the fractal dimension D can be calculated as:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nD ≈ 1.2619\n\nTherefore, the fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 1.2619."
