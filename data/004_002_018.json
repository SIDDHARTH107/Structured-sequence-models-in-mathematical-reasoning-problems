    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (x^3 - 8) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to factor the numerator:\n\nx^3 - 8 = (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)\n\nNow, the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = [(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)] / (x - 2)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 2) terms:\n\nf(x) = x^2 + 2x + 4\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (xâ†’2) (x^2 + 2x + 4)\n\n= (2^2) + (2 * 2) + 4\n\n= 4 + 4 + 4\n\n= 12\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^3 - 8) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 12."
