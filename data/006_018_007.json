    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.05. If a company has 100 employees, what is the probability that at least 5 employees are involved in the fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k employees being involved in the fraud\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k employees out of n, which is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of an employee being involved in the fraud (0.05)\n- n is the total number of employees (100)\n- k is the number of employees involved in the fraud\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 5 employees being involved in the fraud, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 5, 6, 7, ..., 100.\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0) = 0.005920529\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1) = 0.031160680\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2) = 0.081181771\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3) = 0.139575677\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * 0.05^4 * (1-0.05)^(100-4) = 0.178142641\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 5 employees being involved in the fraud:\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - (0.005920529 + 0.031160680 + 0.081181771 + 0.139575677 + 0.178142641) = 1 - 0.435981298 = 0.564018702\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 employees are involved in the fraud is approximately 0.564 or 56.4%."
