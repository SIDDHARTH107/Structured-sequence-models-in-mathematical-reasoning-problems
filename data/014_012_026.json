    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenere cipher with the key \"PI\", we first need to repeat the key to match the length of the message. In this case, the repeated key is \"PIPIPIPIPIPI\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere table to encrypt each letter of the message using the corresponding letter of the repeated key. The Vigenere table is a 26x26 table of letters, where each row is shifted one position to the left compared to the previous row. The first row starts with the alphabet in order (A-Z), and the last row ends with Z followed by A-Y.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter of the message:\n\n1. M (message) + P (key) = X (encrypted)\n2. A + I = I\n3. T + P = C\n4. H + I = R\n5. E + P = N\n6. M + I = V\n7. A + P = P\n8. T + I = W\n9. I + P = Z\n10. C + I = L\n11. S + P = X\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"XICRNPVPWZLX\"."
