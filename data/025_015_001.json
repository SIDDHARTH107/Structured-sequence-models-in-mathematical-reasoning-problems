    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane of the surface S at the point (0, -1/2, 1/2), we first need to find the gradient of the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 4xyz - 1.\n\nThe gradient of F is given by the vector (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z), where the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x + 4yz\n∂F/∂y = 2y + 4xz\n∂F/∂z = 2z + 4xy\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the gradient at the point (0, -1/2, 1/2):\n\n∂F/∂x(0, -1/2, 1/2) = 2(0) + 4(-1/2)(1/2) = -1\n∂F/∂y(0, -1/2, 1/2) = 2(-1/2) + 4(0)(1/2) = -1\n∂F/∂z(0, -1/2, 1/2) = 2(1/2) + 4(0)(-1/2) = 1\n\nSo, the gradient of F at the point (0, -1/2, 1/2) is (-1, -1, 1).\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector (the gradient in this case), and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point (0, -1/2, 1/2).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n-1(x - 0) - 1(y - (-1/2)) + 1(z - 1/2) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-x - y - 1/2 + z - 1/2 = 0\n\nor\n\n-x - y + z = 1\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane of S at the point (0, -1/2, 1/2) is:\n\nx + y - z = -1"
