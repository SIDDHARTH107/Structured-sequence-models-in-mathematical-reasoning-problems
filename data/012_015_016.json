    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and the edges are distributed in such a way that there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 7 vertices (n = 7). The minimum number of edges required to make the graph connected is (n-1) = (7-1) = 6 edges.\n\nSince the graph G has 10 edges, which is more than the minimum required 6 edges, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, we cannot guarantee that the graph is connected without knowing the distribution of the edges. There could be a scenario where the edges are not distributed in a way that connects all vertices.\n\nIn conclusion, it is possible for the graph G with 7 vertices and 10 edges to be connected, but we cannot guarantee it without knowing the distribution of the edges."
