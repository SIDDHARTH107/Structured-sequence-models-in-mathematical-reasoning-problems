    "message_2": "A cyclic group of order 32 is denoted by Z_32, and it is generated by a single element, say g, such that every element in the group can be written as a power of g. The generators of a cyclic group of order n are the elements that have an order equal to n.\n\nIn the case of Z_32, the order of the group is 32. To find the generators, we need to find the elements with order 32. The order of an element a in a group is the smallest positive integer k such that a^k = 1 (identity element).\n\nFor Z_32, the elements are the integers modulo 32, i.e., {0, 1, 2, ..., 31}. The generators are those elements a in Z_32 such that a^32 ≡ 1 (mod 32) and a^k ≠ 1 (mod 32) for all k < 32.\n\nBy Euler's theorem, we know that a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) for any integer a coprime to n, where φ(n) is the Euler's totient function. In our case, n = 32, and φ(32) = 32(1 - 1/2) = 16.\n\nSo, we have a^16 ≡ 1 (mod 32) for all a coprime to 32. To find the generators, we need to find the elements a such that a^32 ≡ 1 (mod 32) and a^16 ≠ 1 (mod 32).\n\nWe can check each element in Z_32:\n\n1. a = 1: 1^32 ≡ 1 (mod 32), but 1^16 ≡ 1 (mod 32), so not a generator.\n2. a = 2: 2^32 ≡ 1 (mod 32), but 2^16 ≡ 1 (mod 32), so not a generator.\n3. a = 3: 3^32 ≡ 1 (mod 32) and 3^16 ≡ 17 (mod 32), so 3 is a generator.\n4. a = 4: 4^32 ≡ 1 (mod 32), but 4^16 ≡ 1 (mod 32), so not a generator.\n\nWe can continue this process for all elements in Z_32. The generators of Z_32 are {3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31}. There are 13 generators in total."
