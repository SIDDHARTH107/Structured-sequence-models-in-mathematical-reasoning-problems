    "message_2": "Wilson's Theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod p). In other words, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nSo, we are looking for the smallest prime number greater than 1. The smallest prime number greater than 1 is 2.\n\nFor n = 2, (n - 1)! + 1 = (2 - 1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer greater than 1 for which (n - 1)! + 1 is divisible by n is 2."
