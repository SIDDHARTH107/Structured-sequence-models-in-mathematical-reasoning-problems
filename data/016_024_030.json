    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal, and its area can be calculated using the geometric series formula. \n\nAt each iteration, the number of squares increases by a factor of 8, and the side length of each square decreases by a factor of 3. Therefore, the area of each square decreases by a factor of 3^2 = 9.\n\nLet A be the total area of the squares in the Sierpinski carpet.\n\nA = (1) + (8/9) + (8^2/9^2) + (8^3/9^3) + ...\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with the first term a = 1 and the common ratio r = 8/9.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:\n\nSum = a / (1 - r)\n\nIn this case:\n\nA = 1 / (1 - 8/9)\n\nA = 1 / (1/9)\n\nA = 1 * 9\n\nA = 9\n\nSo, the total area of the squares in the Sierpinski carpet is 9."
