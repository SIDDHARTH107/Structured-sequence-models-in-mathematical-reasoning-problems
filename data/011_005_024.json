    "message_2": "First, let's find the unique letters in the word \"COMBINATORICS\". The unique letters are C, O, M, B, I, N, A, T, R, and S. There are 10 unique letters.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 4 letters from these 10 unique letters. This can be done using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (unique letters) and k = 4 (letters to choose).\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to choose 4 letters from the word \"COMBINATORICS\" such that the letters chosen have no repeated letters."
