    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve at any point $t$. We can do this by taking the derivative of the parametric equations with respect to $t$.\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = 4t + 3$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = 1$\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vector at the point $(1,1)$. To do this, we need to find the value of $t$ that corresponds to this point. Since $y(t) = t$, we know that $t = 1$. Plugging this value into the equation for $x(t)$:\n\n$x(1) = 2(1)^2 + 3(1) = 2 + 3 = 5$\n\nSo, the point $(1,1)$ corresponds to $t = 1$. Now, let's find the tangent vector at this point by plugging $t = 1$ into the derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt}(1) = 4(1) + 3 = 7$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt}(1) = 1$\n\nThe tangent vector at the point $(1,1)$ is $(7,1)$. Now, we need to find the parallel transport of the initial vector $(2,1)$ along the curve. To do this, we will find the ratio of the magnitudes of the tangent vectors at the initial point and the point $(1,1)$:\n\n$\\frac{||(7,1)||}{||(2,1)||} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7^2 + 1^2}}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{50}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{10}$\n\nNow, we can find the parallel transport of the initial vector by multiplying its components by the ratio of the magnitudes:\n\nParallel transport of $(2,1)$ = $\\sqrt{10}(2,1) = (2\\sqrt{10}, \\sqrt{10})$\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector $(2,1)$ along the curve to the point $(1,1)$ is $(2\\sqrt{10}, \\sqrt{10})$."
