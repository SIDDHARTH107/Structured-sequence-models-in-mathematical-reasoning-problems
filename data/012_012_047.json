    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to determine the girth of graph G with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Determine the minimum number of edges required to form a cycle in a graph with 6 vertices.\n2. Compare this minimum number of edges with the given number of edges (9) to determine if a cycle of that length exists.\n3. If a cycle of that length does not exist, increment the cycle length and repeat steps 1 and 2 until a cycle of the desired length is found.\n\nStep 1: The minimum number of edges required to form a cycle in a graph with 6 vertices is 3 (forming a triangle). This is because a cycle must have at least 3 vertices, and each vertex must be connected to two other vertices.\n\nStep 2: Compare the minimum number of edges (3) with the given number of edges (9). Since 9 is greater than 3, it is possible for a cycle of length 3 to exist in the graph.\n\nStep 3: Since a cycle of length 3 exists, the girth of the graph G is 3."
