We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 9.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible group structures based on the number of Sylow subgroups.\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Both of these subgroups are normal, and their intersection is trivial. Therefore, the group is a direct product of the two subgroups, which results in an abelian group (Z_4 x Z_9). This is not a non-abelian group, so we discard this case.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup (which is normal) and four 3-Sylow subgroups. The group structure is a semi-direct product of the two subgroups. Since there is only one way to define the semi-direct product in this case, we have one non-abelian group.\n\n3. n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there are nine 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup (which is normal). The group structure is a semi-direct product of the two subgroups. There are two possible ways to define the semi-direct product in this case, but one of them results in an abelian group (Z_4 x Z_9). So, we have one non-abelian group.\n\n4. n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there are nine 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. However, this case does not result in any non-abelian groups.\n\nIn summary, there are two non-abelian groups of order 36. They are:\n\n1. The semi-direct product of Z_4 and Z_9 with n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4.\n2. The semi-direct product of Z_4 and Z_9 with n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1."
