    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let x be the integer we are looking for. We have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products: N1 = N/3 = 35, N2 = N/5 = 21, and N3 = N/7 = 15.\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products. We are looking for integers y1, y2, and y3 such that:\n\nN1 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nN2 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\nN3 * y3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\n35 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => y1 = 2 (since 35 * 2 = 70 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\n21 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => y2 = 1 (since 21 * 1 = 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\n15 * y3 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => y3 = 1 (since 15 * 1 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nFinally, we can find the integer x using the formula:\n\nx = (a1 * N1 * y1) + (a2 * N2 * y2) + (a3 * N3 * y3)\n\nwhere a1, a2, and a3 are the remainders from the original congruences (2, 3, and 2, respectively).\n\nx = (2 * 35 * 2) + (3 * 21 * 1) + (2 * 15 * 1)\nx = 140 + 63 + 30\nx = 233\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is congruent to 233 modulo 105. \n\n233 ≡ 23 (mod 105)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions is 23."
