    "message_1": "Sorry, I cannot do that as Deontic logic deals with normative concepts such as obligation, permission, and prohibition, rather than numerical problems. It is a branch of logic that explores how statements about what ought to be can be translated into statements about what is.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are referring to Deontic logic. However, as a mathematician, I am here to help you with any mathematical problems or questions you may have. Please feel free to ask any math-related questions, and I will do my best to assist you."
