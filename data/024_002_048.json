    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve on the surface defined by the equation $z = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ that passes through the point $(1, 0, 1)$ and is tangent to the curve given by the intersection of the plane $z = 1$ and the cylinder $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the parametric representation of the curve of intersection.\n2. Compute the tangent vector to the curve at the given point.\n3. Use the geodesic equation to find the geodesic curve.\n\nStep 1: Find the parametric representation of the curve of intersection.\n\nThe intersection of the plane $z = 1$ and the cylinder $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ can be parametrized as follows:\n\n$x = \\cos(\\theta)$\n$y = \\sin(\\theta)$\n$z = 1$\n\nStep 2: Compute the tangent vector to the curve at the given point.\n\nThe tangent vector to the curve at the point $(1, 0, 1)$ can be found by taking the derivative of the parametric representation with respect to $\\theta$ and evaluating it at the corresponding value of $\\theta$:\n\n$\\frac{d}{d\\theta}(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta), 1) = (-\\sin(\\theta), \\cos(\\theta), 0)$\n\nSince $(1, 0, 1)$ lies on the curve, we have $\\cos(\\theta) = 1$ and $\\sin(\\theta) = 0$. Therefore, the tangent vector at $(1, 0, 1)$ is:\n\n$(-\\sin(\\theta), \\cos(\\theta), 0) = (0, 1, 0)$\n\nStep 3: Use the geodesic equation to find the geodesic curve.\n\nThe geodesic equation for a surface defined by $z = f(x, y)$ is given by:\n\n$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x^2}\\frac{dx}{dt}^2 + 2\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x\\partial y}\\frac{dx}{dt}\\frac{dy}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial y^2}\\frac{dy}{dt}^2) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x^2}\\frac{dx}{dt}^2 + 2\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x\\partial y}\\frac{dx}{dt}\\frac{dy}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial y^2}\\frac{dy}{dt}^2) = 0$\n\nFor the surface $z = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{y^2}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x\\partial y} = -\\frac{xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{x^2}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$\n\nAt the point $(1, 0, 1)$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x^2} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x\\partial y} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial y^2} = 1$\n\nSince the tangent vector at $(1, 0, 1)$ is $(0, 1, 0)$, we can write the geodesic equation as:\n\n$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0$\n$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \\frac{1}{2}(1) = 0$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n$x(t) = x_0$\n$y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + y_0$\n\nSince the geodesic curve passes through the point $(1, 0, 1)$, we have $x_0 = 1$ and $y_0 = 0$. Therefore, the geodesic curve is given by:\n\n$x(t) = 1$\n$y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2$\n\nFinally, we can find the corresponding $z$-coordinate using the surface equation:\n\n$z(t) = \\sqrt{x(t)^2 + y(t)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + (\\frac{1}{2}t^2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{4}t^4}$\n\nThus, the geodesic curve on the surface is given by:\n\n$(x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (1, \\frac{1}{2}t^2, \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{4}t^4})$"
