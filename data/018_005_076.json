    "message_2": "Let A be a set containing 5 elements, i.e., A = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}. By definition, the complement of A, denoted as B, contains all elements that are not in A. In other words, no element in B can be found in A.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B. By definition, the intersection of two sets contains all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nSince B is the complement of A, there are no common elements between A and B. Therefore, the intersection of A and B, A ∩ B, contains no elements.\n\nTo prove that the intersection is the empty set, we can use a proof by contradiction. Suppose that A ∩ B is not the empty set. This means that there exists at least one element x in A ∩ B. However, this contradicts the definition of the complement, as x would have to be in both A and B, which is not possible. Thus, our assumption that A ∩ B is not the empty set must be false.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the intersection of A and B, A ∩ B, is indeed the empty set."
