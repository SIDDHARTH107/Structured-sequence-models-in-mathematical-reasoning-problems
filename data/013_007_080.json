    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 farmers using a common piece of land for grazing their goats. The land can only support a maximum of 20 goats. Each farmer decides how many goats to graze on the land, with the goal of maximizing their own profit. The cost of 1 goat is $50, and the selling price for 1 goat is $100. If a farmer earns a profit of $100 for each goat, how many goats should each farmer graze to achieve maximum profit? What is the maximum total profit earned by all 10 farmers?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation. The land can support a maximum of 20 goats, and there are 10 farmers. If each farmer wants to maximize their profit, they should try to graze as many goats as possible without exceeding the land's capacity.\n\nIf each farmer grazes 2 goats, there will be a total of 20 goats on the land (10 farmers * 2 goats each). This is the maximum number of goats the land can support.\n\nNow let's calculate the profit for each farmer and the total profit for all farmers.\n\nThe cost of 1 goat is $50, and the selling price is $100. So the profit for 1 goat is $100 - $50 = $50.\n\nEach farmer grazes 2 goats, so their individual profit is 2 goats * $50 profit per goat = $100.\n\nThere are 10 farmers, so the maximum total profit earned by all farmers is 10 farmers * $100 profit per farmer = $1000."
