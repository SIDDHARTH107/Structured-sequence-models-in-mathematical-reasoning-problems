    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first three perfect numbers are 6, 28, and 496. To find the fourth perfect number, we can use the formula for even perfect numbers, which is given by:\n\n(2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1)\n\nwhere p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem.\n\nThe first three pairs of (p, 2^p - 1) that satisfy this condition are (2, 3), (3, 7), and (5, 31). The next pair is (7, 127), as both 7 and 127 are prime numbers.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n(2^(7-1)) * (2^7 - 1) = (2^6) * (127) = 64 * 127 = 8128\n\nSo, the fourth perfect number is 8128."
