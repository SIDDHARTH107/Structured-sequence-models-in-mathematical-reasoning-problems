    "message_1": "Let u(x,t) be a harmonic function that satisfies the heat equation: \n\nu_t = 4u_xx\n\nwhere -∞ < x < +∞ and t > 0, with the following initial and boundary conditions: \n\nu(x,0) = x(π - x), \n\nu(0,t) = u(π,t) = 0. \n\nFind the value of u(π/2,0.5) using the method of separation of variables.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the method of separation of variables, we first assume that the solution u(x, t) can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this expression into the heat equation:\n\nu_t = 4u_xx => X(x)T'(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)\n\nNext, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = 4X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = 4X''(x) / X(x) = -λ^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) T'(t) = -λ^2 T(t)\n2) 4X''(x) = -λ^2 X(x)\n\nLet's solve the second equation first:\n\n4X''(x) + λ^2 X(x) = 0\n\nThis is a linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx/2) + B*sin(λx/2)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 0 (since u(0, t) = 0)\nX(π) = A*cos(λπ/2) + B*sin(λπ/2) = B*sin(λπ/2) = 0 (since u(π, t) = 0)\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(λπ/2) = 0. This implies that λ = 2n for some integer n. So, the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = B*sin(nx)\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation:\n\nT'(t) = -λ^2 T(t) => T'(t) = -4n^2 T(t)\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-4n^2 t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for u(x, t) as:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[B_n * sin(nx) * exp(-4n^2 t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = x(π - x):\n\nx(π - x) = ∑[B_n * sin(nx)]\n\nWe can find B_n using the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * ∫[x(π - x) * sin(nx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nBy integrating by parts twice, we get:\n\nB_n = (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (4n) / (n^2 - 1)^2 for odd n\nB_n = 0 for even n\n\nNow, we have the solution:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[(-1)^((n-1)/2) * (4n) / (n^2 - 1)^2 * sin(nx) * exp(-4n^2 t)] for odd n\n\nFinally, we find the value of u(π/2, 0.5):\n\nu(π/2, 0.5) = ∑[(-1)^((n-1)/2) * (4n) / (n^2 - 1)^2 * sin(nπ/2) * exp(-4n^2 * 0.5)] for odd n\n\nThe series converges rapidly, so we can approximate the value by taking the first few terms:\n\nu(π/2, 0.5) ≈ (4/3) * exp(-2) - (4*3/15) * exp(-18) + (4*5/99) * exp(-50) - ...\n\nu(π/2, 0.5) ≈ 0.5413"
