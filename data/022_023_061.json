    "message_1": "A question that a math student can solve under the subtopic \"Complex analysis of wave equations\" is:\n\nWhat is the solution to the complex wave equation \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n\ngiven that the initial conditions are $u(x,0) = 3\\sin(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 2\\cos(x)$, and the boundary conditions are $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$? \n\n(Note: $c$ is a constant representing the speed of the wave.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on x and the other depending on t:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$\nX(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $c^2 X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\n$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-k^2$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2\n$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\nX''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\nT''(t) + c^2 k^2 T(t) = 0\n$$\n\nWe first solve the equation for X(x). The general solution is:\n\n$$\nX(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)\n$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$\nX(0) = B = 0\n$$\n\n$$\nX(\\pi) = A\\sin(k\\pi) = 0\n$$\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sin(k\\pi) = 0$. This implies that $k = n$, where n is an integer. So, the solution for X(x) is:\n\n$$\nX_n(x) = A_n\\sin(nx)\n$$\n\nNow we solve the equation for T(t). The general solution is:\n\n$$\nT_n(t) = C_n\\cos(nct) + D_n\\sin(nct)\n$$\n\nApplying the initial conditions $u(x,0) = 3\\sin(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 2\\cos(x)$, we get:\n\n$$\nu(x,0) = X_n(x)T_n(0) = A_n\\sin(nx)C_n = 3\\sin(x)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = X_n(x)T'_n(0) = A_n\\sin(nx)D_nnc = 2\\cos(x)\n$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $A_nC_n = 3$ for $n = 1$ and $A_nC_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 1$. From the second equation, we have $A_nD_nnc = 2$ for $n = 1$ and $A_nD_nnc = 0$ for $n \\neq 1$. Thus, the solution for T(t) is:\n\n$$\nT_n(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n  3\\cos(t) + \\frac{2}{c}\\sin(t) & \\text{for } n = 1 \\\\\n  0 & \\text{for } n \\neq 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFinally, the solution to the wave equation is a sum of the product of X_n(x) and T_n(t):\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x)T_n(t) = 3\\sin(x)\\cos(ct) + \\frac{2}{c}\\sin(x)\\sin(ct)\n$$"
