    "message_2": "For a particle in a one-dimensional box with V(x) = 0 inside the box and infinity outside the box, the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\n-2m/h^2 * d^2ψ/dx^2 = E * ψ\n\nThe solutions to this equation are of the form:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE)/h. Since the wave function must be zero at the boundaries of the box (x = 0 and x = L), we have:\n\nψ(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivially zero everywhere), we must have sin(kL) = 0. This implies that kL = n * pi, where n is an integer. The energy levels are given by:\n\nE_n = (h^2 * k^2) / (2m) = (h^2 * (n * pi / L)^2) / (2m)\n\nFor the first excited state, we have n = 2 (since n = 1 corresponds to the ground state). Plugging in the values for h, m, and L, we get:\n\nE_2 = (6.62607015 × 10^-34 J·s)^2 * (2 * pi / (1 × 10^-9 m))^2 / (2 * 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg)\n\nE_2 ≈ 1.51 × 10^-19 J\n\nSo the energy of the particle for the first excited state is approximately 1.51 × 10^-19 J."
