    "message_2": "There are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 72. Here is a list of them:\n\n1. C_72 (cyclic group of order 72)\n2. C_36 × C_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 36 and 2)\n3. C_24 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 24 and 3)\n4. C_12 × C_6 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 12 and 6)\n5. C_9 × C_8 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9 and 8)\n6. C_9 × Q_8 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and the quaternion group of order 8)\n7. C_3 × C_4 × C_6 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 4, and 6)\n8. C_3 × (C_4 × C_4) (direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4)\n9. C_3 × D_12 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and the dihedral group of order 12)\n10. C_3 × D_4 × C_3 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 3, the dihedral group of order 4, and another cyclic group of order 3)\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic, meaning they have different structures and cannot be transformed into one another by renaming their elements."
