    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation and the first equation multiplied by 2 from the third equation:\n\n(2) - (1):\nx + 2y + 3z - (x + y + z) = 14 - 6\ny + 2z = 8  (4)\n\n(3) - 2*(1):\n2x + 3y + 5.0001z - 2(x + y + z) = 25 - 2*6\ny + 1.0001z = 13  (5)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n(4) y + 2z = 8\n(5) y + 1.0001z = 13\n\nWe can eliminate y from these two equations by subtracting (4) from (5):\n\n(5) - (4):\ny + 1.0001z - (y + 2z) = 13 - 8\n-0.9999z = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = 5 / -0.9999\nz ≈ -5.0005\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into (4) to find the value of y:\n\ny + 2(-5.0005) = 8\ny - 10.001 = 8\ny ≈ 18.001\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\nx + 18.001 + (-5.0005) = 6\nx ≈ -7.0005\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that solve this system are approximately:\n\nx ≈ -7.0005\ny ≈ 18.001\nz ≈ -5.0005"
