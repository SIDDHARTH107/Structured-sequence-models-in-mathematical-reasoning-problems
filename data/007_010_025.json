    "message_2": "Let the number be x. We have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the smallest positive solution for x. \n\nFirst, find the product of the moduli: M = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nNext, find the modular inverses:\nM1 = M/5 = 7, and we need to find the inverse of 7 modulo 5. 7 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so the inverse is 3.\n\nM2 = M/7 = 5, and we need to find the inverse of 5 modulo 7. 5 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so the inverse is 3.\n\nNow, compute the solution using the formula:\nx = (3 * M1 * 3) + (4 * M2 * 3) (mod 35)\nx = (3 * 7 * 3) + (4 * 5 * 3) (mod 35)\nx = 63 + 60 (mod 35)\nx = 123 (mod 35)\n\nThe smallest positive number that satisfies both congruences is x = 18."
