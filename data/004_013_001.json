    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5x + 2 in the interval [-2, 3], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5x + 2)\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x + 5\n\nNow, let's set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem. After testing possible factors of the constant term 5, we find that x = 1 is a root:\n\nf'(1) = 12(1)^3 - 12(1)^2 - 24(1) + 5 = 0\n\nNow we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x + 5) / (x - 1) = 12x^2 - 24x\n\nNow we have the simplified first derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 24x\n\nSet f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n12x^2 - 24x = 0\n12x(x - 2) = 0\n\nx = 0, 2\n\nSo, we have three critical points: x = 0, x = 1, and x = 2.\n\nNow let's evaluate the function at the critical points and endpoints:\n\nf(-2) = 3(-2)^4 - 4(-2)^3 - 12(-2)^2 + 5(-2) + 2 = 48 - 32 - 48 - 10 + 2 = -40\nf(0) = 3(0)^4 - 4(0)^3 - 12(0)^2 + 5(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = 3(1)^4 - 4(1)^3 - 12(1)^2 + 5(1) + 2 = 3 - 4 - 12 + 5 + 2 = -6\nf(2) = 3(2)^4 - 4(2)^3 - 12(2)^2 + 5(2) + 2 = 48 - 32 - 48 + 10 + 2 = -20\nf(3) = 3(3)^4 - 4(3)^3 - 12(3)^2 + 5(3) + 2 = 243 - 108 - 108 + 15 + 2 = 44\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and endpoints, we find that the maximum value is 44 at x = 3, and the minimum value is -40 at x = -2."
