    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartan connection associated to θ_1, θ_2,..., θ_n, we first need to define the Cartan connection. The Cartan connection is a connection 1-form on the frame bundle of M, which is a principal bundle with structure group the Lorentz group SO(1, n-1). The Cartan connection is a Lie algebra-valued 1-form ω on the frame bundle, which can be pulled back to a Lie algebra-valued 1-form on M via a local frame.\n\nLet {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n} be a local frame on M such that θ_i = g(e_i, ·) for i = 1, 2, ..., n. Then, we can define the Cartan connection ω by its action on the frame {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n} as follows:\n\nω(e_i) = θ_i\n\nNow, we need to calculate the curvature 2-form Ω associated to the Cartan connection ω. The curvature 2-form is given by the exterior covariant derivative of ω:\n\nΩ = dω + ω ∧ ω\n\nUsing the properties of the Levi-Civita connection and the given conditions on the 1-forms θ_i, we can compute the curvature 2-form Ω:\n\nΩ = d(θ_i) + θ_j ∧ θ_k = θ_j ∧ θ_k + θ_j ∧ θ_k = 2θ_j ∧ θ_k\n\nThe Cartan connection associated to θ_1, θ_2,..., θ_n is given by the Lie algebra-valued 1-form ω, which is determined by its action on the local frame {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n}:\n\nω(e_i) = θ_i\n\nThe curvature 2-form Ω associated to the Cartan connection is given by:\n\nΩ = 2θ_j ∧ θ_k"
