    "message_1": "Suppose in a certain market, the probability that a customer will buy a product is 0.6. If 100 potential customers are approached, what is the probability that at least 70 will buy the product?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 70 customers will buy the product, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, customers buying the product)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 100 potential customers)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 70 or more customers buying the product)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 1 - 0.6 = 0.4)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 70 customers will buy the product, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 70, 71, 72, ..., 100.\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 70 to 100\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = Σ [C(100, k) * (0.6)^k * (0.4)^(100-k)] for k = 70 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum can be done using a calculator or software with binomial probability functions. Using a calculator or software, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) ≈ 0.0283\n\nSo, the probability that at least 70 customers will buy the product is approximately 0.0283 or 2.83%."
