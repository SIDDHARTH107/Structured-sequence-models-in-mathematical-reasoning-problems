    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces t-shirts and wants to maximize their profit. The cost to produce each t-shirt is $5 and they sell each t-shirt for $20. The company also has a fixed operational cost of $2000. Using gradient descent method, what is the number of t-shirts that the company must produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of t-shirts to produce. Let's denote the number of t-shirts produced as x. The profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit(x) = Revenue(x) - Cost(x)\n\nRevenue(x) = 20x (since each t-shirt is sold for $20)\nCost(x) = 5x + 2000 (since each t-shirt costs $5 to produce and there is a fixed operational cost of $2000)\n\nNow, let's find the profit function:\n\nProfit(x) = 20x - (5x + 2000) = 15x - 2000\n\nTo find the optimal number of t-shirts to produce, we need to find the maximum point of the profit function. We can do this by finding the derivative of the profit function and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dx = d(15x - 2000)/dx = 15\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and does not depend on x, the profit function is a linear function, and there is no maximum point. This means that the more t-shirts the company produces, the more profit they will make. There is no specific number of t-shirts that will maximize their profit, as their profit will continue to increase as they produce more t-shirts."
