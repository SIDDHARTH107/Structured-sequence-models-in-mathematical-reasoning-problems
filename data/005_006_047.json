    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that their machine produces bolts with a mean length of 5 cm and a standard deviation of 0.5 cm. If a sample of 100 bolts are taken, what is the probability that their mean length is between 4.9 cm and 5.1 cm? (Hint: use the central limit theorem)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the information, we have:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 5 cm\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 0.5 cm\nSample size (n) = 100\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (also known as the standard error), which is calculated as:\n\nStandard error (SE) = σ / √n\nSE = 0.5 / √100\nSE = 0.5 / 10\nSE = 0.05 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the range we are interested in (4.9 cm and 5.1 cm):\n\nLower bound z-score:\nz1 = (4.9 - μ) / SE\nz1 = (4.9 - 5) / 0.05\nz1 = -0.1 / 0.05\nz1 = -2\n\nUpper bound z-score:\nz2 = (5.1 - μ) / SE\nz2 = (5.1 - 5) / 0.05\nz2 = 0.1 / 0.05\nz2 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean falls between these z-scores. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between z1 and z2:\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = P(z < 2) - P(z < -2)\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find:\nP(z < 2) ≈ 0.9772\nP(z < -2) ≈ 0.0228\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean falls between 4.9 cm and 5.1 cm is:\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228\nP(-2 < z < 2) = 0.9544\n\nTherefore, there is approximately a 95.44% chance that the mean length of the sample of 100 bolts is between 4.9 cm and 5.1 cm."
