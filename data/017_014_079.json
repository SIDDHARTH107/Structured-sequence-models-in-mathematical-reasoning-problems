    "message_2": "To prove that there is only one non-abelian group of order 20 (up to isomorphism), we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 20. Since 20 = 2^2 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a 2-Sylow subgroup P of order 4 and a 5-Sylow subgroup Q of order 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 = 1, and the 5-Sylow subgroup Q is unique and normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 5. If n_2 = 1, then the 2-Sylow subgroup P is unique and normal in G, and G would be the direct product of P and Q, which is abelian. However, we are interested in the non-abelian case, so we must have n_2 = 5.\n\nNow, since |P| = 4, P is either isomorphic to Z_4 (the cyclic group of order 4) or V_4 (the Klein four-group). If P is isomorphic to Z_4, then G would be a semidirect product of P and Q, and there is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Q to Aut(P) since |Aut(Z_4)| = 2. This gives us a non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to V_4, then |Aut(V_4)| = 6, but there is no non-trivial homomorphism from Q to Aut(P) since |Q| = 5 and gcd(5, 6) = 1. Thus, in this case, G would be the direct product of P and Q, which is abelian.\n\nTherefore, there is only one non-abelian group of order 20 (up to isomorphism), which is the semidirect product of Z_4 and Z_5 with a non-trivial homomorphism from Z_5 to Aut(Z_4)."
