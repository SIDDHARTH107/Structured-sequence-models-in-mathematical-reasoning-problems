    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge (also known as a cut edge) is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, the cut vertices are B, C, and H. Removing any of these vertices and their incident edges will increase the number of connected components.\n\nThe bridges in the graph are the edges (B, C), (C, D), and (C, H). Removing any of these edges will increase the number of connected components."
