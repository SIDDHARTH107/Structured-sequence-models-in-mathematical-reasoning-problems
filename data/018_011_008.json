    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B and A × {2}.\n\nA × B = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2)}\nA × {2} = {(3,2), (4,2), (5,2)}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of these two Cartesian products, (A × B) ∩ (A × {2}).\n\n(A × B) ∩ (A × {2}) = {(3,2), (4,2), (5,2)}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of set B and the set {2}.\n\nB ∩ {2} = {2}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product A × (B ∩ {2}).\n\nA × (B ∩ {2}) = {(3,2), (4,2), (5,2)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∩ (A × {2}) = A × (B ∩ {2}) = {(3,2), (4,2), (5,2)}.\n\nNow let's prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection.\n\nLet A, B, and C be any sets. We want to show that (A × B) ∩ (A × C) = A × (B ∩ C).\n\nLet (x, y) be an element in (A × B) ∩ (A × C). This means that (x, y) is in both A × B and A × C. So, x is in A, y is in B, and y is in C. Since y is in both B and C, y is in B ∩ C. Therefore, (x, y) is in A × (B ∩ C).\n\nNow let (x, y) be an element in A × (B ∩ C). This means that x is in A and y is in B ∩ C. So, y is in both B and C. Since x is in A and y is in B, (x, y) is in A × B. Similarly, since x is in A and y is in C, (x, y) is in A × C. Therefore, (x, y) is in (A × B) ∩ (A × C).\n\nSince we have shown that any element in (A × B) ∩ (A × C) is in A × (B ∩ C) and vice versa, we can conclude that (A × B) ∩ (A × C) = A × (B ∩ C). This proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection."
