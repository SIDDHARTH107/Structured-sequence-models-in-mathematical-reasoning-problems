    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = z^2/(z-1) centered at z = 0, we can first rewrite the function using partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = z^2/(z-1) = z^2 * (1/(1-z))\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula to expand the term 1/(1-z):\n\n1/(1-z) = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + ...\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of f(z) is:\n\nf(z) = z^2 * (1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + ...) = z^2 + z^3 + z^4 + z^5 + ...\n\nNow, let's determine the convergence of this series on the annulus 0 < |z| < 1. The series converges if the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms goes to zero as n goes to infinity:\n\nlim (n->∞) |a_(n+1)/a_n| = lim (n->∞) |z^(n+1)/z^n| = |z|\n\nSince 0 < |z| < 1, the limit is less than 1, and thus the series converges on the annulus 0 < |z| < 1."
