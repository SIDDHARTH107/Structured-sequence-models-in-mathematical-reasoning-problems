    "message_2": "First, let's try to eliminate one of the variables by using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we can use the elimination method. We want to make the coefficients of y's in both equations the same so that we can eliminate the y variable. The second equation can be simplified by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x + 6y = 9\nDivide by 3:\nx + 2y = 3\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\nx + 2y = 7\nx + 2y = 3\n\nNext, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(x + 2y) - (x + 2y) = 7 - 3\n0 = 4\n\nSince we got a false statement (0 â‰  4), this means that the given system of linear equations has no solution. The system is inconsistent."
