    "message_1": "A car travels due west for 120 meters and then turns 60 degrees to the south. What is the magnitude and direction of the vector representing the car's displacement from its original position? Use trigonometry to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the vector representing the car's displacement from its original position, we can use the law of cosines and the law of sines.\n\nLet's represent the car's displacement as a triangle with sides A, B, and C, and angles α, β, and γ. Side A is the distance traveled due west (120 meters), side B is the distance traveled after turning 60 degrees to the south, and side C is the displacement from the original position. Angle α is the angle between sides A and B (60 degrees), angle β is the angle between sides A and C, and angle γ is the angle between sides B and C.\n\nFirst, we need to find side B. Since the car turns 60 degrees to the south, it forms a 30-60-90 triangle with the ground. Let's call the distance traveled south after turning x meters. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:√3:2. Therefore, we have:\n\nx : B : 120\n1 : √3 : 2\n\nFrom this, we can find the value of B:\n\nB = 120 * (√3 / 2) = 60√3 meters\n\nNow we have the lengths of sides A and B, and the angle α between them. We can use the law of cosines to find the length of side C (the displacement):\n\nC² = A² + B² - 2AB * cos(α)\nC² = 120² + (60√3)² - 2 * 120 * 60√3 * cos(60°)\nC² = 14400 + 10800 - 14400\nC² = 25200\n\nC = √25200 ≈ 158.11 meters\n\nNow we need to find the direction of the displacement vector. We can use the law of sines to find angle β:\n\nsin(β) / B = sin(α) / C\nsin(β) / (60√3) = sin(60°) / 158.11\n\nsin(β) ≈ (60√3) * sin(60°) / 158.11\nsin(β) ≈ 0.5774\n\nβ ≈ arcsin(0.5774) ≈ 35.9°\n\nSince the car initially traveled due west, the direction of the displacement vector is 35.9° south of west.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the displacement vector is approximately 158.11 meters, and its direction is 35.9° south of west."
