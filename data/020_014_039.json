    "message_1": "A company wants to produce a minimum-cost rectangular prism-shaped box with a volume of 100 cubic centimeters. The base of the box must have sides of length 'x' and 'y' centimeters, while the height of the box must be 'z' centimeters. The material cost for each side of the box is as follows: $1 per square centimeter for the base and $2 per square centimeter for the sides. \n\nWhat are the dimensions of the box that minimize the material cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the material cost, we need to minimize the surface area of the box, given the volume constraint. The volume of the box is given by V = xyz = 100 cm³. The surface area of the box is given by A = xy + 2xz + 2yz, where the cost of the base is $1 per square centimeter and the cost of the sides is $2 per square centimeter.\n\nUsing the volume constraint, we can express z in terms of x and y: z = 100/(xy). Now, we can substitute this expression for z into the surface area equation:\n\nA(x, y) = xy + 2x(100/(xy)) + 2y(100/(xy)) = xy + 200/x + 200/y\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can use the first-order partial derivatives of A with respect to x and y and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂A/∂x = y - 200/x² = 0\n∂A/∂y = x - 200/y² = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we have y = 200/x². Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx - 200/(200/x²)² = 0\nx - x³/10000 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10000 and rearranging, we get:\n\nx³ - 10000x = 0\nx(x² - 10000) = 0\n\nSince x cannot be zero (the box would have no volume), we have x² = 10000, which gives x = 10√10 cm. Now, we can find y using the equation y = 200/x²:\n\ny = 200/(10√10)² = 200/1000 = 1/5 cm\n\nFinally, we can find z using the volume constraint:\n\nz = 100/(xy) = 100/(10√10 * 1/5) = 5√10 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the material cost are x = 10√10 cm, y = 1/5 cm, and z = 5√10 cm."
