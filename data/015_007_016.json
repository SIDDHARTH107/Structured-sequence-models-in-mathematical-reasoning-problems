    "message_2": "The logistic map is given by the equation $x_{n+1} = rx_n(1-x_n)$, where $r$ is a parameter that controls the behavior of the system. In this case, we are given $r = 4$. The period-doubling route to chaos refers to the sequence of bifurcations that occur as $r$ is increased, leading to a doubling of the period of the system's behavior until it eventually becomes chaotic.\n\nTo find the value of $r$ at which the system becomes chaotic, we need to find the value of $r$ at the onset of chaos, which is known as the Feigenbaum point. This point is characterized by the accumulation of period-doubling bifurcations, and it can be found using the Feigenbaum constant, denoted by $\\delta \\approx 4.6692$.\n\nThe Feigenbaum constant relates the values of $r$ at successive period-doubling bifurcations. Let $r_n$ be the value of $r$ at the $n$-th period-doubling bifurcation. Then, the Feigenbaum constant is given by:\n\n$$\\delta = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{r_{n+1} - r_n}{r_{n+2} - r_{n+1}}$$\n\nThe value of $r$ at the onset of chaos, denoted by $r_\\infty$, can be found using the following formula:\n\n$$r_\\infty = r_1 + (r_2 - r_1) + (r_3 - r_2) + \\cdots$$\n\nSince we know the Feigenbaum constant, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\n$$r_\\infty = r_1 + \\frac{r_2 - r_1}{\\delta} + \\frac{r_3 - r_2}{\\delta^2} + \\cdots$$\n\nFor the logistic map, the first period-doubling bifurcation occurs at $r_1 = 3$, and the second period-doubling bifurcation occurs at $r_2 = 1 + \\sqrt{6} \\approx 3.4495$. Using these values, we can approximate the value of $r_\\infty$:\n\n$$r_\\infty \\approx 3 + \\frac{3.4495 - 3}{4.6692} \\approx 3.0962$$\n\nThus, the value of $r$ at which the system becomes chaotic is approximately $r_\\infty \\approx 3.0962$."
