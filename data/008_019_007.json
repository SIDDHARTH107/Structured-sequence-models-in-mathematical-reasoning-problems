    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the second and third equations. Multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract the second equation from the result:\n\n2(x + 2y + 3z) - (2x - y + z) = 2(4) - (1 + 2i)\n2x + 4y + 6z - 2x + y - z = 8 - 1 - 2i\n5y + 5z = 7 - 2i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\ny + z = (7 - 2i)/5\n\nNext, let's eliminate y from the first and third equations. Multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract the third equation from the result:\n\n3(x + 2y + 3z) - (3x + y + 4z) = 3(4) - (-2i)\n3x + 6y + 9z - 3x - y - 4z = 12 + 2i\n5y + 5z = 12 + 2i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\ny + z = (12 + 2i)/5\n\nWe now have two equations with the same variables y and z:\n\ny + z = (7 - 2i)/5\ny + z = (12 + 2i)/5\n\nSince both equations are equal to y + z, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n(7 - 2i)/5 = (12 + 2i)/5\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominators:\n\n7 - 2i = 12 + 2i\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n-5 - 2i = 2i\n\nAdd 2i to both sides:\n\n-5 = 4i\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\ni = -5/4\n\nNow that we have the value of i, we can substitute it back into either equation for y + z:\n\ny + z = (12 + 2i)/5\ny + z = (12 + 2(-5/4))/5\ny + z = (12 - 5/2)/5\ny + z = (19/2)/5\ny + z = 19/10\n\nNow, let's substitute the value of z back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 4\nx + 2y + 3(-5/4) = 4\nx + 2y - 15/4 = 4\n\nAdd 15/4 to both sides:\n\nx + 2y = 31/4\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables, x and y:\n\nx + 2y = 31/4\ny + (-5/4) = 19/10\n\nSolve for y in the second equation:\n\ny = 19/10 + 5/4\ny = 38/20 + 25/20\ny = 63/20\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx + 2(63/20) = 31/4\nx + 126/20 = 31/4\nx = 31/4 - 126/20\nx = 155/20 - 126/20\nx = 29/20\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 29/20\ny = 63/20\nz = -5/4"
