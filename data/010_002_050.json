The sequence is defined by $x_n = \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nLet's consider the limit:\n\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}$$\n\nAs $n$ approaches infinity, the value of $\\frac{1}{n}$ approaches 0. Therefore, the limit of the sequence is:\n\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = 0$$\n\nSince the limit exists and is a finite value, the sequence $(x_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ is convergent. The sequence converges to the limit 0."
