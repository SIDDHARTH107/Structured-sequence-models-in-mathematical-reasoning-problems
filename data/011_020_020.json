    "message_1": "A factory produces 1000 items per day. The production manager decides to make the production process more efficient by dividing it into three shifts with different numbers of workers. In the first shift, 10 workers can produce 200 items, in the second shift, 15 workers can produce 300 items, and in the third shift, 20 workers can produce 500 items. What is the minimum number of workers needed in each shift to produce 1000 items per day?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of workers needed in each shift, we need to determine the production rate per worker in each shift.\n\nFirst shift: 10 workers produce 200 items, so the production rate per worker is 200 items / 10 workers = 20 items/worker.\n\nSecond shift: 15 workers produce 300 items, so the production rate per worker is 300 items / 15 workers = 20 items/worker.\n\nThird shift: 20 workers produce 500 items, so the production rate per worker is 500 items / 20 workers = 25 items/worker.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of workers needed in each shift to produce 1000 items per day.\n\nFirst shift: To produce 200 items, we need 200 items / 20 items/worker = 10 workers.\n\nSecond shift: To produce 300 items, we need 300 items / 20 items/worker = 15 workers.\n\nThird shift: To produce 500 items, we need 500 items / 25 items/worker = 20 workers.\n\nSo, the minimum number of workers needed in each shift to produce 1000 items per day is 10 workers in the first shift, 15 workers in the second shift, and 20 workers in the third shift."
