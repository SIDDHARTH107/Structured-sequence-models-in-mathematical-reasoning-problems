    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob using ElGamal encryption with a prime modulus p=23 and generator g=5. Alice's private key is a=6 and her public key is A=g^a mod p. The message she wants to send is 17. \n\na) Find Alice's public key A.\nb) Choose a random secret key k=3 for Bob and calculate his public key B=g^k mod p.\nc) Calculate the shared key s=B^a mod p and use it to encrypt the message.\nd) Decrypt the message using Bob's private key (k) and the shared key (s).",
    "message_2": "a) To find Alice's public key A, we use the formula A = g^a mod p.\nA = 5^6 mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 10\n\nAlice's public key A is 10.\n\nb) To find Bob's public key B, we use the formula B = g^k mod p with k=3.\nB = 5^3 mod 23\nB = 125 mod 23\nB = 3\n\nBob's public key B is 3.\n\nc) To calculate the shared key s, we use the formula s = B^a mod p.\ns = 3^6 mod 23\ns = 729 mod 23\ns = 9\n\nThe shared key s is 9. Now, we use it to encrypt the message (m=17) using the formula: encrypted message (c) = m * s mod p.\nc = 17 * 9 mod 23\nc = 153 mod 23\nc = 2\n\nThe encrypted message is 2.\n\nd) To decrypt the message, we first find the inverse of the shared key s modulo p. Let's call this inverse s_inv.\ns * s_inv â‰¡ 1 mod 23\n\nWe can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find s_inv. After applying the algorithm, we get:\ns_inv = 18\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message using the formula: decrypted message (m) = c * s_inv mod p.\nm = 2 * 18 mod 23\nm = 36 mod 23\nm = 17\n\nThe decrypted message is 17, which is the original message Alice wanted to send."
