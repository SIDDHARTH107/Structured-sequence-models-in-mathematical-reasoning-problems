    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. In other words, the sequence f(0), f(f(0)), f(f(f(0))), ... remains bounded.\n\nThe largest value of N for which all points in a square of side 2N centered at the origin belong to the Mandelbrot set can be found by considering the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. It is known that the Mandelbrot set is contained within a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Therefore, any square of side 2N centered at the origin with N > 1 will have points outside this circle and thus not belong entirely to the Mandelbrot set.\n\nFor N = 1, the square of side 2 centered at the origin has vertices at (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), and (1, 1). All of these points are within the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, and it can be verified that they belong to the Mandelbrot set. Therefore, the largest value of N for which all points in a square of side 2N centered at the origin belong to the Mandelbrot set is N = 1."
