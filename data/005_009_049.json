    "message_1": "A math student wants to know if there is a significant difference between the average ages of two groups of students. The student decides to use the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to compare the two groups. The age of 10 students from group A are as follows: 19, 21, 20, 24, 18, 22, 20, 21, 19, 23. The age of 12 students from group B are as follows: 22, 25, 21, 20, 26, 23, 27, 21, 22, 23, 25, 24. Using a significance level of 0.05, can the student conclude that there is a significant difference in the average age between the two groups?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, we first need to combine the two groups and rank the ages from smallest to largest. Here are the combined ages and their ranks:\n\n18(1), 19(2), 19(3), 20(4), 20(5), 20(6), 21(7), 21(8), 21(9), 21(10), 22(11), 22(12), 22(13), 23(14), 23(15), 23(16), 24(17), 24(18), 25(19), 25(20), 26(21), 27(22)\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the ranks for each group:\n\nGroup A: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 17 = 72\nGroup B: 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 13 + 15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 = 191\n\nNext, we need to find the expected rank sum for each group. The formula for the expected rank sum is:\n\nE(R) = n1(n1 + n2 + 1) / 2\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the two groups.\n\nFor Group A: E(R) = 10(10 + 12 + 1) / 2 = 10(23) / 2 = 115\nFor Group B: E(R) = 12(12 + 10 + 1) / 2 = 12(23) / 2 = 138\n\nNow, we need to calculate the test statistic W for each group:\n\nW = |R - E(R)|\n\nFor Group A: W = |72 - 115| = 43\nFor Group B: W = |191 - 138| = 53\n\nWe will use the smaller W value (43) to compare with the critical value. Since we have 10 samples in group A and 12 samples in group B, we can refer to the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test table to find the critical value. At a significance level of 0.05, the critical value for (10, 12) is 50.\n\nSince our test statistic W (43) is smaller than the critical value (50), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the average age between the two groups at a 0.05 significance level."
