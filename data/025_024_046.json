    "message_1": "Suppose that we have a line in the plane with equation $y = m x$, where $m$ is a real number. Consider the action of the special linear group $\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$ on the plane by linear transformations.\n\nDefine the stabilizer $G$ of the line to be the subgroup of $\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$ that fixes the line pointwise. It's a fact that $G$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^\\times$, the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers.\n\nSuppose that $v = (a,b)$ is a non-zero vector in the plane that is not lying on the line $y = m x$. Show that there is a unique element $g \\in G$ that sends $v$ to a scalar multiple of $(1,0)$. Then compute this scalar multiple explicitly in terms of $m,a,b$.",
    "message_2": "Let $g \\in G$ be an element of the stabilizer group, which means that $g$ fixes the line $y = mx$ pointwise. Since $G$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^\\times$, we can represent $g$ as a $2 \\times 2$ matrix of the form:\n\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix} r & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{r} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere $r \\in \\mathbb{R}^\\times$ is a nonzero real number. This is because the determinant of $g$ must be 1, so we have $r \\cdot \\frac{1}{r} = 1$.\n\nNow, let $v = (a, b)$ be a non-zero vector in the plane that is not lying on the line $y = mx$. We want to find a unique element $g \\in G$ that sends $v$ to a scalar multiple of $(1, 0)$. In other words, we want to find $r$ such that:\n\n$$\ng \\cdot v = \\begin{pmatrix} r & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{r} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nfor some scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Multiplying the matrices, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} ra \\\\ \\frac{b}{r} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that $ra = \\lambda$ and $\\frac{b}{r} = 0$. Since $r$ is nonzero, this implies that $b = 0$. However, this contradicts the assumption that $v$ is not lying on the line $y = mx$. Therefore, there is no unique element $g \\in G$ that sends $v$ to a scalar multiple of $(1, 0)$ when $v$ is not lying on the line $y = mx$."
