    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 48, we first need to find the number of all possible groups of order 48 and then subtract the number of abelian groups.\n\nThe prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nn(48) = n(2^4) * n(3^1) = (4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 * 2 = 10\n\nSo there are 10 possible groups of order 48.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 48. An abelian group of order 48 can be represented as a direct product of cyclic groups of orders that multiply to 48. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C_48 (Cyclic group of order 48)\n2. C_24 x C_2\n3. C_16 x C_3\n4. C_12 x C_4\n5. C_8 x C_6\n6. C_4 x C_4 x C_3\n\nThere are 6 abelian groups of order 48.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups to find the number of non-abelian groups:\n\n10 (total groups) - 6 (abelian groups) = 4\n\nThere are 4 non-abelian groups of order 48."
