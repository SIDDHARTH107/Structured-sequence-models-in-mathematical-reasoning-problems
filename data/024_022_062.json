    "message_2": "To find the isometries that map the given points, we first note that isometries in the Euclidean plane can be combinations of translations, rotations, and reflections. Let's first find the distance between the given points and their images.\n\nThe distance between $(1,1)$ and $(-2,3)$ is given by:\n\n$d_1 = \\sqrt{(-2-1)^2 + (3-1)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4} = \\sqrt{13}$\n\nThe distance between $(3,2)$ and $(5,7)$ is given by:\n\n$d_2 = \\sqrt{(5-3)^2 + (7-2)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 25} = \\sqrt{29}$\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the line segments connecting the given points and their images.\n\nLet $A = (1,1)$, $A' = (-2,3)$, $B = (3,2)$, and $B' = (5,7)$. The angle $\\theta$ between the line segments $AA'$ and $BB'$ can be found using the dot product:\n\n$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{(A'-A) \\cdot (B'-B)}{\\lVert A'-A \\rVert \\lVert B'-B \\rVert} = \\frac{(-3,2) \\cdot (2,5)}{\\sqrt{13} \\sqrt{29}} = \\frac{-6 + 10}{\\sqrt{13} \\sqrt{29}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{13} \\sqrt{29}}$\n\nNow, we can consider the possible isometries:\n\n1. Translation: Since the distances between the points and their images are different, a simple translation cannot be the isometry.\n\n2. Rotation: We can try to find a rotation that maps the points. Let the rotation center be $(x_c, y_c)$ and the rotation angle be $\\alpha$. The rotation transformation can be written as:\n\n$(x', y') = (x_c + (x - x_c)\\cos\\alpha - (y - y_c)\\sin\\alpha, y_c + (x - x_c)\\sin\\alpha + (y - y_c)\\cos\\alpha)$\n\nApplying this transformation to the given points, we have:\n\n$(-2, 3) = (x_c + (1 - x_c)\\cos\\alpha - (1 - y_c)\\sin\\alpha, y_c + (1 - x_c)\\sin\\alpha + (1 - y_c)\\cos\\alpha)$\n\n$(5, 7) = (x_c + (3 - x_c)\\cos\\alpha - (2 - y_c)\\sin\\alpha, y_c + (3 - x_c)\\sin\\alpha + (2 - y_c)\\cos\\alpha)$\n\nThis system of equations can be solved for the rotation center $(x_c, y_c)$ and the rotation angle $\\alpha$. However, since the distances and the angle between the points are not preserved, a rotation is not the correct isometry.\n\n3. Reflection: We can try to find a reflection that maps the points. Let the reflection line be given by the equation $y = mx + b$. The reflection transformation can be written as:\n\n$(x', y') = \\left(\\frac{(1 + m^2)x - 2my + 2mb}{1 + m^2}, \\frac{(1 + m^2)y + 2mx - 2mb}{1 + m^2}\\right)$\n\nApplying this transformation to the given points, we have:\n\n$(-2, 3) = \\left(\\frac{(1 + m^2)(1) - 2m(1) + 2mb}{1 + m^2}, \\frac{(1 + m^2)(1) + 2m(1) - 2mb}{1 + m^2}\\right)$\n\n$(5, 7) = \\left(\\frac{(1 + m^2)(3) - 2m(2) + 2mb}{1 + m^2}, \\frac{(1 + m^2)(2) + 2m(3) - 2mb}{1 + m^2}\\right)$\n\nThis system of equations can be solved for the reflection line parameters $m$ and $b$. However, since the distances and the angle between the points are not preserved, a reflection is not the correct isometry.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no isometry that maps the point $(1,1)$ to $(-2,3)$ and the point $(3,2)$ to $(5,7)$, as the distances and the angle between the points are not preserved."
