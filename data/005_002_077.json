    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the average height of 50 randomly selected students, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a sample mean:\n\nCI = x̄ ± Z * (σ / √n)\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95%), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the sample mean (x̄) is equal to the population mean, which is 175 cm. The population standard deviation (σ) is 5 cm, and the sample size (n) is 50.\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (you can find this value in a standard Z-score table).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 175 ± 1.96 * (5 / √50)\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard error = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error (Z * standard error):\n\nMargin of error = 1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.3859\n\nFinally, calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = 175 ± 1.3859\nCI = (173.6141, 176.3859)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the average height of 50 randomly selected students from this college is approximately (173.6 cm, 176.4 cm)."
