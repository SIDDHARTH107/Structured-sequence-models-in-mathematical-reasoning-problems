    "message_1": "A student wants to buy a new calculator. They have two options: a basic calculator for $25 or a scientific calculator for $50. The probability of passing their math exam with the basic calculator is 0.8 and with the scientific calculator is 0.9. If the student passes the exam, they will receive $100. If they fail, they will receive $0. Which calculator should the student choose based on their expected value?",
    "message_2": "To determine which calculator the student should choose, we need to calculate the expected value for each option. The expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then summing the results.\n\nExpected value for basic calculator:\nPassing the exam: 0.8 * $100 = $80\nFailing the exam: 0.2 * $0 = $0\nTotal expected value: $80 - $25 (cost of the calculator) = $55\n\nExpected value for scientific calculator:\nPassing the exam: 0.9 * $100 = $90\nFailing the exam: 0.1 * $0 = $0\nTotal expected value: $90 - $50 (cost of the calculator) = $40\n\nBased on the expected value, the student should choose the basic calculator, as it has a higher expected value ($55) compared to the scientific calculator ($40)."
