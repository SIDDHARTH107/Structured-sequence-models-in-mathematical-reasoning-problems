    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm and two bases of lengths 25 cm and 15 cm. What is the area of this trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (sum of the lengths of the bases) × height\n\nIn this case, the height is 10 cm, and the lengths of the bases are 25 cm and 15 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (25 + 15) × 10\n\nArea = (1/2) × 40 × 10\n\nArea = 20 × 10\n\nArea = 200 square centimeters\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 200 square centimeters."
