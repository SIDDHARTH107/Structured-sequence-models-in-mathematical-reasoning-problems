    "message_1": "A Discriminant Analysis was conducted on a set of data containing three groups, with each group having five observations. The results of Discriminant Analysis revealed two significant functions with Wilks' lambda values of 0.34 and 0.68, respectively. What percentage of the total variation in the data is accounted for by each function?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of total variation accounted for by each function, we need to calculate the proportion of explained variation for each function using the Wilks' lambda values.\n\nThe proportion of explained variation for a function can be calculated as:\n\nProportion of explained variation = (1 - Wilks' lambda value) * 100\n\nFor the first function with Wilks' lambda value of 0.34:\n\nProportion of explained variation = (1 - 0.34) * 100\nProportion of explained variation = 0.66 * 100\nProportion of explained variation = 66%\n\nFor the second function with Wilks' lambda value of 0.68:\n\nProportion of explained variation = (1 - 0.68) * 100\nProportion of explained variation = 0.32 * 100\nProportion of explained variation = 32%\n\nSo, the first function accounts for 66% of the total variation in the data, and the second function accounts for 32% of the total variation in the data."
