The observer walked 50 meters towards the base of the tree and found that the angle of elevation to the top of the tree is now 60 degrees. Find the height of the tree.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the tree as h meters, and the distance from the first observation point to the base of the tree as x meters. From the first observation point, we can form a right triangle with the tree, where the angle of elevation is 45 degrees. Using the tangent function, we have:\n\ntan(45) = h/x\n1 = h/x (since tan(45) = 1)\nx = h\n\nFrom the second observation point, the observer is now 50 meters closer to the tree, so the distance from this point to the base of the tree is (x - 50) meters. We can form another right triangle with the tree, where the angle of elevation is 60 degrees. Using the tangent function again, we have:\n\ntan(60) = h/(x - 50)\n√3 = h/(x - 50) (since tan(60) = √3)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (h and x):\n\n1) x = h\n2) √3 = h/(x - 50)\n\nSubstitute equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n√3 = h/(h - 50)\n\nNow solve for h:\n\nh√3 = h^2 - 50h\nh^2 - 50h - h√3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in h. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nh = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -50, and c = -h√3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nh = (50 ± √((-50)^2 - 4(1)(-h√3))) / 2(1)\n\nh = (50 ± √(2500 + 4h√3)) / 2\n\nNow, we know that h must be a positive value since it represents the height of the tree. Therefore, we can ignore the negative solution and only consider the positive one:\n\nh = (50 + √(2500 + 4h√3)) / 2\n\nTo solve for h, we can use an iterative approach or numerical methods. However, we can make an educated guess and check if it works. Let's try h = 50:\n\n50 = (50 + √(2500 + 4(50)√3)) / 2\n\n100 = 50 + √(2500 + 200√3)\n\n50 = √(2500 + 200√3)\n\n2500 = 2500 + 200√3 - 100√3\n\n0 = 100√3 - 200√3\n\n0 = 100(√3 - 2√3)\n\nSince the left and right sides of the equation are equal, our guess of h = 50 is correct. Therefore, the height of the tree is 50 meters."
