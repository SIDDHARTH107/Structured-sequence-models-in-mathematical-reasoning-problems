    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose you intercepted the following encrypted message that was encrypted with a Playfair Cipher: \"ED ZD PJ AD VI BQ QD EA XV HK PQ EA YP\". Using cryptanalysis, determine the plaintext message. The encryption key used in this case was \"MATHEMATICS\".",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message encrypted with a Playfair Cipher, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the given key \"MATHEMATICS\". The matrix is created by filling in the letters of the keyword (without repeating any letters) and then filling in the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is usually combined with 'I').\n\nThe matrix for the keyword \"MATHEMATICS\" is:\n\nM A T H E\nI C S B D\nF G K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we will decrypt the message \"ED ZD PJ AD VI BQ QD EA XV HK PQ EA YP\" using the matrix:\n\n1. ED -> PL\n2. ZD -> AY\n3. PJ -> F\n4. AD -> AI\n5. VI -> R\n6. BQ -> C\n7. QD -> H\n8. EA -> L\n9. XV -> O\n10. HK -> G\n11. PQ -> R\n12. EA -> L\n13. YP -> S\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext message is \"PLAYFAIRCHALOGRLS\". Since Playfair Cipher doesn't use spaces, we need to add spaces to make it readable: \"PLAYFAIR CHALOGRLS\". The decrypted message is \"PLAYFAIR CHALOGRLS\"."
