    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct groups of order 36 up to isomorphism, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is equal to 1 mod p and divides the order of the group.\n\nSince 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, we know that there are Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in the group of order 36. Let's denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups as n_2 and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that there are two elements of order 9 and one element of order 3. This means that there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9 (since the order of a Sylow 3-subgroup must be a power of 3, and 9 is the largest power of 3 that divides 36). Therefore, n_3 = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. We know that n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2 and divides 36. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, and 9. However, since there is only one element of order 2, there must be a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 (since the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup must be a power of 2, and 4 is the largest power of 2 that divides 36). Therefore, n_2 = 1.\n\nNow that we have determined that there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, we can use the following theorem:\n\nIf G is a group of order p^a * q^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and G has a unique Sylow p-subgroup P and a unique Sylow q-subgroup Q, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q.\n\nIn our case, the group of order 36 is isomorphic to the direct product of the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. The only groups of order 4 are the cyclic group Z_4 and the Klein four-group V_4, and the only group of order 9 is the cyclic group Z_9.\n\nTherefore, there are two distinct groups of order 36 up to isomorphism: Z_4 × Z_9 and V_4 × Z_9."
