    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Jacobi iterative method, we first need to rearrange the equations to isolate x and y:\n\nx = (22 - y) / 4\ny = (13 - x) / 3\n\nNow, we will use the Jacobi iterative method to find the solution. We start with an initial guess for x and y, and then iteratively update the values using the above equations. Let's start with x = 0 and y = 0 as our initial guess:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (22 - 0) / 4 = 5.50\ny1 = (13 - 0) / 3 = 4.33\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (22 - 4.33) / 4 = 4.42\ny2 = (13 - 5.50) / 3 = 2.50\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (22 - 2.50) / 4 = 4.88\ny3 = (13 - 4.42) / 3 = 2.86\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = (22 - 2.86) / 4 = 4.79\ny4 = (13 - 4.88) / 3 = 2.71\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = (22 - 2.71) / 4 = 4.82\ny5 = (13 - 4.79) / 3 = 2.74\n\nWe can see that the values are converging. Let's round the values to two decimal places:\n\nx = 4.82\ny = 2.74\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations using the Jacobi iterative method is x = 4.82 and y = 2.74."
