    "message_2": "Let A be a set with A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements that are not in A. To find the intersection of A and its complement, we need to find the elements that are common to both A and A'.\n\nBy definition, the elements in A' are not in A. Therefore, there are no elements that can be common to both A and A'. This means that the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nTo show that the intersection is indeed the empty set, let's assume there exists an element x that belongs to both A and A'. If x is in A, then it cannot be in A' because A' contains elements not in A. Similarly, if x is in A', then it cannot be in A. This contradiction shows that there cannot be any element common to both A and A', and thus the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set (∅)."
