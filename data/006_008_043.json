    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The probability of rain tomorrow is 0.4.\n2. It rains three times in every seven days on average.\n3. We need to find the probability that it will rain tomorrow and also rain exactly three times over the next seven days.\n\nSince it is given that it rains three times in every seven days on average, the probability of rain on any given day is 3/7.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of it raining exactly three times over the next seven days, given that it will rain tomorrow.\n\nSince it will rain tomorrow, we need to find the probability of it raining exactly two more times in the remaining six days. This is a binomial probability problem. We can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\nn = number of trials (6 days)\nk = number of successes (2 more rainy days)\np = probability of success (3/7)\n\nP(X = 2) = (6C2) * (3/7)^2 * (4/7)^4\n\nP(X = 2) = (15) * (9/49) * (256/2401)\n\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.3249\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of both events happening: it raining tomorrow (0.4) and it raining exactly two more times in the next six days (0.3249).\n\nP(rain tomorrow and 3 times in 7 days) = P(rain tomorrow) * P(2 more rainy days in next 6 days)\n\nP(rain tomorrow and 3 times in 7 days) = 0.4 * 0.3249\n\nP(rain tomorrow and 3 times in 7 days) ≈ 0.1300\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain tomorrow and also rain exactly three times over the next seven days is approximately 0.1300 or 13%."
