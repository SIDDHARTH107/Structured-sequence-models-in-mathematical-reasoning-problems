    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding a non-trivial factor of a composite number. To find the smallest prime factor of 1027 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random starting point x0 (usually 2) and a function f(x) (usually f(x) = x^2 + 1).\n2. Generate a sequence of numbers using the function f(x) and the previous number in the sequence: xi = f(xi-1) mod N, where N is the number we want to factor (1027 in this case).\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between two numbers in the sequence and N: d = GCD(xi - xj, N).\n4. If d is a non-trivial factor of N (1 < d < N), we found a factor. Otherwise, repeat steps 2-4 with a new starting point or function.\n\nLet's start with x0 = 2 and f(x) = x^2 + 1:\n\n1. x0 = 2\n2. x1 = f(x0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5 mod 1027\n3. x2 = f(x1) = 5^2 + 1 = 26 mod 1027\n4. x3 = f(x2) = 26^2 + 1 = 677 mod 1027\n5. x4 = f(x3) = 677^2 + 1 = 350 mod 1027\n\nNow, we calculate the GCD of the differences between the numbers in the sequence and 1027:\n\n1. d1 = GCD(x1 - x0, 1027) = GCD(5 - 2, 1027) = GCD(3, 1027) = 1\n2. d2 = GCD(x2 - x1, 1027) = GCD(26 - 5, 1027) = GCD(21, 1027) = 1\n3. d3 = GCD(x3 - x2, 1027) = GCD(677 - 26, 1027) = GCD(651, 1027) = 1\n4. d4 = GCD(x4 - x3, 1027) = GCD(350 - 677, 1027) = GCD(-327, 1027) = GCD(327, 1027) = 29\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, d4 = 29. Since 29 is a prime number, it is the smallest prime factor of 1027."
