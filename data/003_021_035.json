    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product formula is:\n\nv · w = |v| * |w| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere v · w is the dot product of the two vectors, |v| and |w| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nv · w = (3 * 5) + (4 * -2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|v| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|w| = √(5² + (-2)²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n7 = 5 * √29 * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 * √29:\n\ncos(θ) = 7 / (5 * √29)\n\nNow, find the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(7 / (5 * √29))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 1.2094 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, multiply by 180/π:\n\nθ ≈ 1.2094 * (180/π) ≈ 69.3 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 69 degrees."
