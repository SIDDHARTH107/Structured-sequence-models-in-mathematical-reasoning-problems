    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = cos(2x^2 - 3x + 1) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet g(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1, so f(x) = cos(g(x)). \n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the outer function, which is the cosine function. The derivative of cos(x) with respect to x is -sin(x).\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the inner function g(x) with respect to x. The derivative of 2x^2 - 3x + 1 with respect to x is 4x - 3.\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule: \n\nf'(x) = (derivative of outer function) * (derivative of inner function)\nf'(x) = -sin(g(x)) * (4x - 3)\n\nSubstitute g(x) back into the equation:\n\nf'(x) = -sin(2x^2 - 3x + 1) * (4x - 3)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = -(4x - 3)sin(2x^2 - 3x + 1)"
