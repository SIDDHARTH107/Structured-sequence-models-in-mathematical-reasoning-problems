Then, we will use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 3 -2  5 | 12\n| 1  4 -2 | 6\n| 2 -1  3 | 2\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - (1/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (2/3)R1\n\n|  3  -2   5 |  12\n|  0   6  -4 |   2\n|  0   1   1 |  -6\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - (1/6)R2\n\n|  3  -2   5 |  12\n|  0   6  -4 |   2\n|  0   0   2 |  -8\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\n2z = -8\nz = -4\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find y.\n\n6y - 4z = 2\n6y + 16 = 2\n6y = -14\ny = -7/3\n\nStep 5: Back-substitute to find x.\n\n3x - 2y + 5z = 12\n3x + 14/3 - 20 = 12\n3x = 50/3\nx = 50/9\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 50/9\ny = -7/3\nz = -4"
