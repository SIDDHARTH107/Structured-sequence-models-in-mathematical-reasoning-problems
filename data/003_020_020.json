    "message_2": "To find the angle that the ramp makes with the ground, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the side opposite the angle is the height of the ramp (2 feet), and the side adjacent to the angle is the horizontal distance from the bottom of the ramp to the point where it meets the ground (which we need to find).\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the horizontal distance:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the legs of the right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse (the length of the ramp). In this case, a is the height of the ramp (2 feet), and c is the length of the ramp (8 feet).\n\n2^2 + b^2 = 8^2\n4 + b^2 = 64\nb^2 = 60\nb = √60\n\nNow that we have the horizontal distance (b), we can find the tangent of the angle:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(angle) = 2/√60\n\nTo find the angle, we can use the inverse tangent function (arctan):\n\nangle = arctan(2/√60)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the angle in degrees:\n\nangle ≈ 14.48 degrees\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the angle that the ramp makes with the ground is approximately 14 degrees."
