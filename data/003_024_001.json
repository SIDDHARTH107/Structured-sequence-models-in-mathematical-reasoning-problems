    "message_2": "To find the component of the boat's velocity directed due North, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. The North component of the velocity can be found using the formula:\n\nNorth component = speed × cos(angle)\n\nwhere speed is 20 km/h and angle is 30° East of North.\n\nNorth component = 20 × cos(30°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n30° × (π/180) = (30 × π) / 180 = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle:\n\ncos(π/6) ≈ 0.866025\n\nFinally, we can find the North component of the velocity:\n\nNorth component = 20 × 0.866025 ≈ 17.32 km/h\n\nSo, the component of the boat's velocity directed due North is approximately 17.32 km/h."
