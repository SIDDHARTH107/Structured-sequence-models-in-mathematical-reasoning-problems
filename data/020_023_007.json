    "message_1": "Suppose you have $100,000 to invest in two different stocks. Based on historical data, the first stock has an expected return of 8% with a standard deviation of 10%, while the second stock has an expected return of 12% with a standard deviation of 15%. What is the optimal allocation of your investment between the two stocks to maximize expected return while keeping the risk (measured by the variance of the portfolio return) at most 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation between the two stocks, we will use the concept of portfolio theory. Let's denote the proportion of investment in the first stock as x and the proportion of investment in the second stock as (1-x). The expected return and risk (variance) of the portfolio can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\nExpected return of the portfolio (Rp): Rp = x * R1 + (1-x) * R2\nVariance of the portfolio (σp^2): σp^2 = x^2 * σ1^2 + (1-x)^2 * σ2^2 + 2 * x * (1-x) * Cov(1,2)\n\nWhere R1 and R2 are the expected returns of stock 1 and stock 2, σ1^2 and σ2^2 are the variances of stock 1 and stock 2, and Cov(1,2) is the covariance between the two stocks. Since we don't have information about the correlation between the two stocks, we will assume that they are uncorrelated, which means Cov(1,2) = 0.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nR1 = 0.08\nσ1^2 = 0.10^2 = 0.01\nR2 = 0.12\nσ2^2 = 0.15^2 = 0.0225\n\nWe want to maximize the expected return Rp while keeping the risk (variance) at most 0.05. So, we have the following optimization problem:\n\nMaximize Rp = 0.08x + 0.12(1-x)\nSubject to: x^2 * 0.01 + (1-x)^2 * 0.0225 ≤ 0.05\n\nFirst, let's find the x value that satisfies the constraint:\n\nx^2 * 0.01 + (1-x)^2 * 0.0225 = 0.05\n0.01x^2 + 0.0225 - 0.045x + 0.0225x^2 = 0.05\n0.0325x^2 - 0.045x + 0.0225 = 0.05\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for x:\n\n0.0325x^2 - 0.045x - 0.0275 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (0.045 ± √(0.045^2 - 4 * 0.0325 * -0.0275)) / (2 * 0.0325)\n\nx ≈ 1.385 or x ≈ -0.606\n\nSince x represents the proportion of investment in stock 1, it must be between 0 and 1. Therefore, we discard the negative solution and consider x ≈ 1.385. However, this value is greater than 1, which means that the constraint is not binding, and we can invest 100% in stock 2 to maximize the expected return.\n\nSo, the optimal allocation is to invest $0 in stock 1 and $100,000 in stock 2."
