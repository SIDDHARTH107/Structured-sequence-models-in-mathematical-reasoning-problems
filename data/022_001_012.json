    "message_2": "The function f(z) = (1 + z)^2 is already analytic on the open unit disc D = {z : |z| < 1} since it is a polynomial and polynomials are entire functions (i.e., analytic on the whole complex plane). Now, we want to find an analytic continuation of f(z) to the region C \\ [1, ∞).\n\nNotice that f(z) = (1 + z)^2 is also analytic on the region C \\ [1, ∞) since it is a polynomial. The only issue is the branch cut along the real interval [1, ∞). To avoid this issue, we can rewrite f(z) in terms of its principal branch.\n\nLet's rewrite f(z) using the polar form of complex numbers. Let z = r * e^(iθ), where r = |z| and θ is the argument of z. Then,\n\nf(z) = (1 + r * e^(iθ))^2 = (1 + r * (cos(θ) + i * sin(θ)))^2.\n\nNow, we can use the binomial theorem to expand the square:\n\nf(z) = (1 + 2r * (cos(θ) + i * sin(θ)) + r^2 * (cos^2(θ) + 2i * cos(θ) * sin(θ) - sin^2(θ))).\n\nSimplifying the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\nf(z) = (1 + r^2 * cos(2θ) + 2r * cos(θ)) + i * (2r * sin(θ) + r^2 * sin(2θ)).\n\nNow, let's define the function F(z) as:\n\nF(z) = (1 + |z|^2 * cos(2 * arg(z)) + 2|z| * cos(arg(z))) + i * (2|z| * sin(arg(z)) + |z|^2 * sin(2 * arg(z))).\n\nNotice that F(z) agrees with f(z) on the open unit disc D = {z : |z| < 1} and is analytic on C \\ [1, ∞) since it is defined in terms of the principal branch of the argument. Therefore, F(z) is the desired analytic continuation of f(z) from the open unit disc D to the region C \\ [1, ∞)."
