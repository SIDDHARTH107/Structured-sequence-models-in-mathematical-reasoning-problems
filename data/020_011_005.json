    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a multi-objective optimization problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company is trying to produce two products A and B. The production of product A generates a revenue of $10 per unit and requires 3 hours of labor and 2 units of raw material. The production of product B generates a revenue of $8 per unit and requires 2 hours of labor and 1 unit of raw material. The company has 600 hours of labor and 400 units of raw material available for production. Find the optimal production plan that maximizes the total revenue for the company while minimizing the labor and raw material usage.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We want to maximize the total revenue, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nRevenue = 10x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 600 (labor constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 400 (raw material constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 600\n   y ≤ (600 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + y ≤ 400\n   y ≤ 400 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. Now, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and raw material constraint:\n   3x + 2y = 600\n   2x + y = 400\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 100 and y = 200.\n\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n   3x + 2(0) = 600\n   x = 200\n\n3. Intersection of raw material constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n   2(0) + y = 400\n   y = 400\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 400), (200, 0), and (100, 200).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function (Revenue = 10x + 8y) at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 400): Revenue = 10(0) + 8(400) = 0 + 3200 = $3200\n2. (200, 0): Revenue = 10(200) + 8(0) = 2000 + 0 = $2000\n3. (100, 200): Revenue = 10(100) + 8(200) = 1000 + 1600 = $2600\n\nThe maximum revenue is $3200, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 400 units of product B. This production plan also minimizes the labor and raw material usage, as it only requires 400 units of raw material and 800 hours of labor, which is within the available resources."
