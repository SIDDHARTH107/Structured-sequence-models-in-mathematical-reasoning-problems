Therefore, aₙ = 0 for all n.\n\n3. bₙ:\nbₙ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] (x - 3)sin(nx) dx\n   = (1/π) [ ∫[-π, π] x*sin(nx) dx - 3∫[-π, π] sin(nx) dx ]\n\nThe second integral is zero since sin(nx) is an odd function. Now, let's solve the first integral using integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\nThen, du = dx, v = -cos(nx)/n\n\n∫[-π, π] x*sin(nx) dx = -x*cos(nx)/n | from -π to π + (1/n)∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx\n\nThe integral of cos(nx) is also zero since cos(nx) is an even function. So, we have:\n\n∫[-π, π] x*sin(nx) dx = -π*cos(nπ)/n + π*cos(-nπ)/n = (-1)^n * 2π/n\n\nNow, we can write bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * (-1)^n * 2π/n = (-1)^n * 2/n\n\nFinally, the Fourier series of f(x) = x - 3 on the interval -π < x < π is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(-1)^n * (2/n) * sin(nx)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ..."
