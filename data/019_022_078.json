    "message_2": "To determine the best investment option based on expected returns, we can calculate the expected value for each option. The expected value is calculated by multiplying the potential return by the probability of that return occurring.\n\nOption A Expected Value:\n$20,000 * 0.80 = $16,000\n\nOption B Expected Value:\n$30,000 * 0.50 = $15,000\n\nOption C Expected Value:\n$40,000 * 0.30 = $12,000\n\nBased on the expected values, Option A has the highest expected return of $16,000. Since the company has a moderate risk tolerance, Option A would be the best investment option for the company."
