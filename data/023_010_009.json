    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem related to applying the Fourier transform in image processing:\n\nSuppose you have a black and white JPEG image that is 512 pixels wide and 256 pixels tall. The image data is represented using 8 bits per pixel. Apply the Fourier transform to this image and determine the size of the resulting Fourier transformed image. How many complex numbers are needed to represent the entire Fourier transformed image, and what is the total number of bits needed to store this information?",
    "message_2": "When you apply the Fourier transform to an image, the resulting transformed image will have the same dimensions as the original image. In this case, the Fourier transformed image will also be 512 pixels wide and 256 pixels tall.\n\nEach pixel in the Fourier transformed image will be represented by a complex number, which consists of a real part and an imaginary part. Since the dimensions of the transformed image are the same as the original image, there will be a total of 512 * 256 = 131,072 complex numbers needed to represent the entire Fourier transformed image.\n\nTo store a complex number, you need to store both the real and imaginary parts. Assuming that each part is represented using the same number of bits as the original image (8 bits per part), you would need 16 bits to store each complex number.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bits needed to store the Fourier transformed image would be:\n\n131,072 complex numbers * 16 bits per complex number = 2,097,152 bits."
