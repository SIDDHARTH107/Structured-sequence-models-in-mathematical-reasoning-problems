    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by successively applying the Koch curve-generating transformation to each line segment in the figure. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (Initial line segment length) * (Number of sides) * (Multiplier)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial line segment length is 3 units, and the Koch snowflake has 3 sides (it's a triangle). The multiplier for each iteration is 4/3, as each line segment is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nGiven the iteration depth n = 4, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * 3 * (4/3)^4\nPerimeter = 9 * (256/81)\nPerimeter = 9 * 3.160493827\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the 4th iteration is approximately 28.44444444 units."
