    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is connected or not, we can use the following fact: A graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and the minimum number of edges required to connect n vertices is (n-1).\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 8 vertices. The minimum number of edges required to connect 8 vertices is (8-1) = 7 edges.\n\nSince the given graph has 10 edges, which is more than the minimum required (7 edges), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as the extra edges could form cycles within the graph.\n\nTo definitively determine if the graph is connected or not, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges."
