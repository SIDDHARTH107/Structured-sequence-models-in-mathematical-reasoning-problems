    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology groups of a torus, we can use the fact that the De Rham cohomology groups are isomorphic to the singular cohomology groups with real coefficients. The torus can be obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a square, so we can use the standard cell decomposition of a torus with one 0-cell, two 1-cells, and one 2-cell.\n\nLet $M$ be a torus. Then, we have the following chain complex of real vector spaces:\n\n$$\n0 \\rightarrow C^0(M) \\xrightarrow{d^0} C^1(M) \\xrightarrow{d^1} C^2(M) \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nwhere $C^p(M)$ denotes the space of $p$-cochains on $M$. Since $M$ has one 0-cell, $C^0(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. Similarly, $M$ has two 1-cells, so $C^1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, and $M$ has one 2-cell, so $C^2(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we compute the differentials. The differential $d^0: C^0(M) \\rightarrow C^1(M)$ is the zero map, since there are no boundaries of 0-cells. The differential $d^1: C^1(M) \\rightarrow C^2(M)$ is also the zero map, since the 2-cell is attached to the 1-cells without any orientation reversal.\n\nThe De Rham cohomology groups are given by the quotient of the kernel and image of the differentials:\n\n1. $H^0_{dR}(M) = \\ker(d^0) / \\text{im}(0) = C^0(M) / 0 \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2. $H^1_{dR}(M) = \\ker(d^1) / \\text{im}(d^0) = C^1(M) / 0 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n3. $H^2_{dR}(M) = \\ker(0) / \\text{im}(d^1) = C^2(M) / 0 \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSo, the first three De Rham cohomology groups of the torus $M$ are:\n\n$$\nH^0_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}, \\quad H^1_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2, \\quad H^2_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}.\n$$"
