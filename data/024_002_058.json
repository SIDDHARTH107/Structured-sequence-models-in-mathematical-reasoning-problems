    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between two given points on the surface of a sphere using the concept of geodesics, we need to find the great circle distance between the two points. A great circle is a circle on the surface of the sphere whose center coincides with the center of the sphere, and a geodesic on a sphere is a segment of a great circle.\n\nLet's denote the two points on the surface of the sphere as A and B, and the radius of the sphere as r (in this case, r = 4). To find the great circle distance between A and B, we first need to find the angle θ between the two points, measured at the center of the sphere.\n\nWe can find θ using the dot product of the position vectors of A and B. Let the position vectors of A and B be →a and →b, respectively. Then, the dot product of →a and →b is given by:\n\n→a • →b = |→a| |→b| cos(θ)\n\nSince A and B are on the surface of the sphere, |→a| = |→b| = r. Thus, we can find the angle θ as:\n\ncos(θ) = (→a • →b) / (r^2)\n\nNow, we can find the great circle distance d between A and B using the formula:\n\nd = r * θ\n\nSo, to find the shortest distance between two given points on the surface of a sphere with radius 4 using the concept of geodesics, we need to find the angle θ between the two points using their position vectors, and then calculate the great circle distance using the formula d = 4 * θ."
