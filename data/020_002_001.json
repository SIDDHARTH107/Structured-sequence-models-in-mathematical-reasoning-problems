The manufacturer has a limited amount of glass material and needs to optimize the number of each type of glass to produce in order to maximize their profit. Each wine glass requires 4 units of glass material and 1 unit of labor, while each beer glass requires 3 units of glass material and 2 units of labor. \n\nThe manufacturer has 100 units of glass material and 50 units of labor available. How many of each type of glass should the manufacturer produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of wine glasses and y be the number of beer glasses.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 15x + 10y\n\nConstraints are given by the availability of glass material and labor:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 100 (glass material constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 50 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Glass material constraint: 4x + 3y ≤ 100\ny ≤ (100 - 4x) / 3\n\n2. Labor constraint: x + 2y ≤ 50\ny ≤ (50 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these constraints, including the non-negativity constraint.\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of glass material constraint and labor constraint:\n4x + 3y = 100\nx + 2y = 50\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 20 and y = 15.\n\n2. Intersection of glass material constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n4x + 3(0) = 100\nx = 25\n\n3. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + 2y = 50\ny = 25\n\nSo, the corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (25, 0), (0, 25), and (20, 15).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P(x, y) at each of these corner points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 15(0) + 10(0) = $0\nP(25, 0) = 15(25) + 10(0) = $375\nP(0, 25) = 15(0) + 10(25) = $250\nP(20, 15) = 15(20) + 10(15) = $450\n\nThe maximum profit is $450, which occurs when the manufacturer produces 20 wine glasses and 15 beer glasses."
