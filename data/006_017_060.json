    "message_1": "A town has two major routes connecting it to the city. It is estimated that the probability of an accident occurring on Route A is 0.05 and on Route B is 0.02. What is the probability that at least one accident will occur whenever you travel from the town to the city?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring on either route and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident on Route A is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\nThe probability of no accident on Route B is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nThe probability of no accidents on both routes is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.95 * 0.98 = 0.931.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring:\n\n1 - 0.931 = 0.069.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one accident occurring when traveling from the town to the city is 0.069 or 6.9%."
