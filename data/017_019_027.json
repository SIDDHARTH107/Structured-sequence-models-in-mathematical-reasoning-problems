    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 36: 36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n2. Determine the possible group structures based on the prime factorization:\n   a. C_36 (cyclic group of order 36)\n   b. C_9 x C_4 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9 and 4)\n   c. C_18 x C_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 18 and 2)\n   d. C_3 x C_3 x C_2 x C_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 3, 2, and 2)\n3. Determine the number of non-isomorphic groups for each group structure:\n   a. There is only 1 cyclic group of order 36: C_36\n   b. There is only 1 direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9 and 4: C_9 x C_4\n   c. There are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 18: C_18 and C_9 x C_2. So, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of the form C_18 x C_2.\n   d. For the group structure C_3 x C_3 x C_2 x C_2, we have the following possibilities:\n      i. C_3 x C_3 x C_4 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 3, and 4)\n      ii. C_3 x C_3 x C_2 x C_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 3, 2, and 2)\n      iii. C_9 x C_2 x C_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9, 2, and 2)\n      There are 3 non-isomorphic groups of this form.\n\nSo, there are a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
