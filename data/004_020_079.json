    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the force in lifting the object, we need to find the integral of the force function with respect to the distance. First, we need to find the force function.\n\nSince the force varies linearly from 400 N at the bottom (0 m) to 300 N at the top (3 m), we can represent the force function as a linear equation:\n\nF(x) = mx + b\n\nwhere x is the distance in meters, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nWe know that F(0) = 400 N and F(3) = 300 N. We can use these points to find the slope (m) and y-intercept (b).\n\nm = (F(3) - F(0)) / (3 - 0) = (300 - 400) / (3 - 0) = -100 / 3\n\nNow, we can find the y-intercept (b) using F(0) = 400 N:\n\n400 = (-100 / 3)(0) + b\nb = 400\n\nSo, the force function is:\n\nF(x) = -100/3 * x + 400\n\nNow, we can find the work done by integrating the force function with respect to the distance from 0 to 3 meters:\n\nW = ∫[F(x) dx] from 0 to 3\nW = ∫[-100/3 * x + 400 dx] from 0 to 3\n\nTo integrate, we can use the power rule:\n\n∫[x^n dx] = (x^(n+1)) / (n+1)\n\nW = [(-100/3 * x^2 / 2) + 400x] from 0 to 3\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = [(-100/3 * 3^2 / 2) + 400(3)] - [(-100/3 * 0^2 / 2) + 400(0)]\nW = [(-100/3 * 9 / 2) + 1200] - [0]\nW = [-150 + 1200]\nW = 1050 J\n\nTherefore, the work done by the force in lifting the object is 1050 Joules."
