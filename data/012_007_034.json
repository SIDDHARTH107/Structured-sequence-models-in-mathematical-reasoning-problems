    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in the network, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will look for augmenting paths and update the flow along those paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Start with an initial flow of 0 in all edges.\n2. Find an augmenting path from A to F using DFS or BFS. Update the flow along the path with the minimum capacity of the edges in the path.\n3. Repeat step 2 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's find the augmenting paths and update the flow:\n\nPath 1: A -> B -> D -> F (capacity = min(10, 6, 8) = 6)\nUpdated capacities:\nA -> B: 4\nA -> C: 5\nB -> D: 0\nB -> E: 5\nC -> D: 10\nC -> E: 5\nD -> F: 2\nE -> F: 8\n\nPath 2: A -> C -> D -> F (capacity = min(5, 10, 2) = 2)\nUpdated capacities:\nA -> B: 4\nA -> C: 3\nB -> D: 0\nB -> E: 5\nC -> D: 8\nC -> E: 5\nD -> F: 0\nE -> F: 8\n\nPath 3: A -> B -> E -> F (capacity = min(4, 5, 8) = 4)\nUpdated capacities:\nA -> B: 0\nA -> C: 3\nB -> D: 0\nB -> E: 1\nC -> D: 8\nC -> E: 5\nD -> F: 0\nE -> F: 4\n\nPath 4: A -> C -> E -> F (capacity = min(3, 5, 4) = 3)\nUpdated capacities:\nA -> B: 0\nA -> C: 0\nB -> D: 0\nB -> E: 1\nC -> D: 8\nC -> E: 2\nD -> F: 0\nE -> F: 1\n\nNo more augmenting paths can be found.
