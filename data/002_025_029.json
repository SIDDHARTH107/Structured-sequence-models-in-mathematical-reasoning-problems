    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has a base of length 8 cm and each of its equal sides measures 10 cm. What is the length of the altitude drawn from any vertex to the opposite side?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the isosceles triangle as ABC, with AB = AC = 10 cm and BC = 8 cm. Let D be the midpoint of BC, so AD is the altitude drawn from vertex A to the opposite side BC.\n\nSince AD is the altitude, it is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, triangle ABD is a right-angled triangle with AD as the height and BD as the base. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AD.\n\nIn right-angled triangle ABD, we have:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n\nSince D is the midpoint of BC, BD = BC/2 = 8/2 = 4 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n10^2 = AD^2 + 4^2\n100 = AD^2 + 16\nAD^2 = 100 - 16\nAD^2 = 84\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of AD:\n\nAD = √84 ≈ 9.165 cm\n\nSo, the length of the altitude drawn from any vertex to the opposite side is approximately 9.165 cm."
