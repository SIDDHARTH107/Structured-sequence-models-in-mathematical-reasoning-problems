    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval (-π, π), we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the series:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function, its integral over a symmetric interval around the origin is zero. Therefore, a_0 = 0.\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(n * x) dx\n\nAgain, since x is an odd function and cos(n * x) is an even function, their product is an odd function. Therefore, the integral over a symmetric interval around the origin is zero. So, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫(-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * sin(n * π) - (1/n^2) * sin(n * (-π))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = sin(n * (-π)) = 0 for all integer values of n, b_n = 0.\n\nThus, the Fourier series for f(x) = x on the interval (-π, π) is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nHowever, since we found that b_n = 0, the Fourier series is identically zero. This is because the function f(x) = x is not periodic on the interval (-π, π), and its Fourier series converges to the zero function."
