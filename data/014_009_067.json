    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel Cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. If the round function uses a 32-bit key and applies an S-box with 4 input bits and 4 output bits, how many rounds are required to achieve a strong level of encryption?",
    "message_2": "The number of rounds required for a strong level of encryption in a Feistel Cipher depends on various factors such as the complexity of the round function, the key schedule, and the overall security requirements. However, a general rule of thumb is that more rounds provide better security.\n\nFor a Feistel Cipher with a 64-bit block size, it is common to use at least 16 rounds to achieve a strong level of encryption. This is based on the design of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which uses 16 rounds and has been widely studied and analyzed for its security properties.\n\nHowever, since the round function in this case uses a 32-bit key and applies an S-box with 4 input bits and 4 output bits, it might be less complex than the round function used in DES. Therefore, to achieve a strong level of encryption, it might be necessary to use more than 16 rounds. The exact number of rounds required would depend on a thorough security analysis of the specific Feistel Cipher implementation."
