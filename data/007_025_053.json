    "message_2": "To calculate the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g = 2, a = 3, and p = 11.\n   A = 2^3 mod 11\n   A = 8 mod 11\n   A = 8\n\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where g = 2, b = 5, and p = 11.\n   B = 2^5 mod 11\n   B = 32 mod 11\n   B = 10\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K = B^a mod p, where B = 10, a = 3, and p = 11.\n   K = 10^3 mod 11\n   K = 1000 mod 11\n   K = 1\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K = A^b mod p, where A = 8, b = 5, and p = 11.\n   K = 8^5 mod 11\n   K = 32768 mod 11\n   K = 1\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key, K = 1. They can now use this key to encrypt and decrypt messages between them."
