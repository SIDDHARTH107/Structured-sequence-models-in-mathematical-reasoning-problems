    "message_2": "To find the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern, we need to divide the height of the tallest frond by the height of the original fern.\n\nScaling factor = (Height of the tallest frond) / (Height of the original fern)\n\nScaling factor = 13 meters / 1 meter\n\nScaling factor = 13\n\nSo, the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern is 13."
