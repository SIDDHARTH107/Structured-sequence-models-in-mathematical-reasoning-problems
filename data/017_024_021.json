    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is congruent to 1 modulo p and divides the order of the group.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Thus, we have a 2-Sylow subgroup of order 32 and a 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3.\n\nLet's first consider the 3-Sylow subgroup. By the second fact, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of 3-Sylow subgroups are 1 and 4. If there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, it is normal. If there are four 3-Sylow subgroups, there is no guarantee that any of them are normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the 2-Sylow subgroup. The number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is one 2-Sylow subgroup, which means it is normal.\n\nSince the 2-Sylow subgroup is normal, we can consider the possible structures of the 2-Sylow subgroup and the 3-Sylow subgroup separately.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroup of order 32, there are five possibilities up to isomorphism: Z_32, Z_16 x Z_2, Z_8 x Z_4, Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2, and Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2. (This can be determined using the classification of finite abelian groups.)\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3, there is only one possibility up to isomorphism: Z_3.\n\nNow, we can consider the possible structures of the whole group, taking into account the possible structures of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups.\n\n1. If the 3-Sylow subgroup is normal (i.e., there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup), then the whole group is a direct product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, there are 5 possibilities for the whole group, corresponding to the 5 possibilities for the 2-Sylow subgroup.\n\n2. If the 3-Sylow subgroup is not normal (i.e., there are four 3-Sylow subgroups), then we need to consider the semidirect product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, there are 5 possibilities for the 2-Sylow subgroup and 1 possibility for the 3-Sylow subgroup, but not all of these possibilities will yield non-isomorphic groups. The actual number of non-isomorphic groups in this case is 10. (Determining this number requires a more detailed analysis of the possible semidirect products.)\n\nIn total, there are 5 (from the first case) + 10 (from the second case) = 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
