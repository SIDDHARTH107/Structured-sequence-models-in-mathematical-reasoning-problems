    "message_2": "To find the least element $x$ of $S$ such that $\\varphi(x)$ is true, we need to analyze the formula $\\varphi(x)$.\n\n$\\varphi(x)$ states that for all properties $P$, if there exists a least element $y$ with property $P$, then $x$ also has property $P$. In other words, $x$ has every property that has a least element.\n\nNow, let's consider the property $Q(z) = (z \\leq x)$. Since $S$ is non-empty and totally ordered, there must be a least element $m$ in $S$ such that $Q(m)$ is true. By definition of the least element, $m \\leq x$ for all $x \\in S$. \n\nNow, we want to show that $\\varphi(m)$ is true. For any property $P$, if there exists a least element $y$ with property $P$, then $m \\leq y$ since $m$ is the least element of $S$. Therefore, $m$ also has property $P$. This means that $\\varphi(m)$ is true.\n\nThus, the least element $x$ of $S$ such that $\\varphi(x)$ is true is the least element $m$ of the domain of discourse $S$."
