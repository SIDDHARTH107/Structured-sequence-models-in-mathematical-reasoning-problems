    "message_2": "A 12-letter message can be divided into three groups of 4 letters each. Since the transposition cipher reverses the order of every 4 letters, we need to find the number of possible arrangements for each group and then multiply them together.\n\nFor a group of 4 letters, there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange them. However, since the transposition cipher only reverses the order, there are actually only 2 unique arrangements for each group: the original order and the reversed order.\n\nSo, for each of the three groups, there are 2 possible arrangements. To find the total number of possible arrangements for the entire 12-letter message, we multiply the number of arrangements for each group together:\n\n2 (arrangements for the first group) * 2 (arrangements for the second group) * 2 (arrangements for the third group) = 2^3 = 8\n\nThere are 8 different possible arrangements for a 12-letter message encrypted with this transposition cipher."
