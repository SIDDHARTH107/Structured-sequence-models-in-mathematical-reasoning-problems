    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective algebraic variety over the complex numbers. Suppose the canonical divisor class K_X is not pseudo-effective. Prove that X admits a minimal model.\n\nFor example, the student could prove this statement for X = P^n, the n-dimensional complex projective space. In this case, the canonical divisor class is ample, so the statement reduces to showing that P^n has a minimal model.",
    "message_2": "To prove that X admits a minimal model, we will use the Minimal Model Program (MMP) which is a powerful tool in birational geometry. The MMP consists of a series of steps, called \"flips\" and \"divisorial contractions,\" which transform a given variety into a birationally equivalent one with better properties. The goal is to reach a minimal model, which is a variety with minimal Kodaira dimension among all varieties in its birational class.\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions:\n\n1. A divisor D on X is called nef (numerically effective) if D.C >= 0 for every curve C in X.\n2. A divisor D on X is called pseudo-effective if there exists a sequence of effective divisors {D_i} such that D_i converges to D in the numerical sense.\n3. A variety X is called minimal if K_X is nef.\n\nNow, let's prove the statement:\n\nSince K_X is not pseudo-effective, by the Cone Theorem, there exists an extremal ray R in the cone of curves of X such that K_X.R < 0. By the Contraction Theorem, there exists a contraction morphism φ: X → Y with respect to R. There are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: φ is a divisorial contraction, i.e., it contracts a divisor E to a point. In this case, we have K_X = φ^*K_Y + aE for some a > 0. Since K_X is not pseudo-effective, K_Y is also not pseudo-effective. We can then apply the same argument to Y and continue the process. Since X is a smooth projective variety, this process must terminate after finitely many steps, and we obtain a minimal model.\n\nCase 2: φ is a small contraction, i.e., it contracts a curve C to a curve. In this case, we have K_X = φ^*K_Y. Since K_X is not pseudo-effective, K_Y is also not pseudo-effective. We can then apply the same argument to Y and continue the process. However, in this case, we may encounter flips, which are birational transformations that replace a contracted curve with another curve. After finitely many flips and small contractions, we will reach a variety with a divisorial contraction, and we can proceed as in Case 1.\n\nIn both cases, we eventually reach a minimal model, as desired.\n\nFor the example of X = P^n, the n-dimensional complex projective space, the canonical divisor class K_X is indeed ample, and P^n is already a minimal model, since K_X is nef."
