    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 out of 10 students being affected by the flu, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (students affected by the flu) out of n trials (students in the class)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n- p is the probability of success (student being affected by the flu)\n- n is the number of trials (students in the class)\n- k is the number of successes (students affected by the flu)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 10 (students in the class)\n- p = 0.15 (probability of a student being affected by the flu)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 2 students being affected by the flu, which means we need to find the probability of 2, 3, 4, ..., 10 students being affected by the flu and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the complementary probability (the probability of 0 or 1 student being affected) and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(at least 2 students) = 1 - P(0 students) - P(1 student)\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(0 students) = C(10, 0) * (0.15)^0 * (1-0.15)^(10-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.85)^10 ≈ 0.1969\n\nP(1 student) = C(10, 1) * (0.15)^1 * (1-0.15)^(10-1) = 10 * 0.15 * (0.85)^9 ≈ 0.3834\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 students being affected:\n\nP(at least 2 students) = 1 - P(0 students) - P(1 student) = 1 - 0.1969 - 0.3834 ≈ 0.4197\n\nSo, the probability of at least 2 out of 10 students in a class of 30 being affected by the flu is approximately 0.4197 or 41.97%."
