    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the period and amplitude of the following trigonometric function: \n\n$f(x) = 5cos(2x - \\dfrac{\\pi}{3})$\n\nCan you solve for the period and amplitude of the given function?",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the given trigonometric function, we need to analyze the function and identify the relevant coefficients.\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is:\n\n$f(x) = A\\cos(Bx - C)$\n\nWhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our given function:\n\n$f(x) = 5\\cos(2x - \\dfrac{\\pi}{3})$\n\nWe can see that:\n\nA = 5\nB = 2\n\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is:\n\nAmplitude = |A| = |5| = 5\n\nTo find the period, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = $\\dfrac{2\\pi}{|B|}$\n\nIn our case, B = 2, so:\n\nPeriod = $\\dfrac{2\\pi}{|2|} = \\dfrac{2\\pi}{2} = \\pi$\n\nSo, the amplitude of the given function is 5, and the period is $\\pi$."
