    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, the function represents the distance traveled by the bicyclist, and the interval [a, b] represents the time interval of 2 hours. The average rate of change of the function (distance) over the interval [a, b] is the average speed of the bicyclist.\n\nTo find the average speed, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nTotal distance = 40 miles\nTotal time = 2 hours\n\nAverage speed = 40 miles / 2 hours = 20 miles per hour\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there must be at least one point during the trip where the cyclist's speed was exactly 20 miles per hour."
