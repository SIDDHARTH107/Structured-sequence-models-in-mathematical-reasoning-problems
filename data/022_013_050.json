    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral ∫γ f(z)dz, we can use the Cauchy's integral formula or the residue theorem. However, since f(z) is a polynomial and has no singularities, the integral over the closed contour γ will be zero. This is a direct consequence of the Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed contour is zero.\n\nSo, ∫γ f(z)dz = 0."
