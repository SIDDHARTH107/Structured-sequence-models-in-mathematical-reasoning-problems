    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 4 centimeters and a height of 10 centimeters. What is the surface area of the cylinder?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 4 centimeters and the height (h) is 10 centimeters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(4²) + 2π(4)(10)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(16) + 2π(40)\n\nSurface Area = 32π + 80π\n\nSurface Area = 112π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 112 × 3.14\n\nSurface Area ≈ 351.68\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 351.68 square centimeters."
