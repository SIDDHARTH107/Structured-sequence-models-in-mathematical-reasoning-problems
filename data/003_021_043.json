    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors u and v, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu · v = (3)(-2) + (4)(3) = -6 + 12 = 6\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v| = √((-2)² + 3²) = √(4 + 9) = √13\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for cos(θ):\n\n6 = 5 * √13 * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 * √13:\n\ncos(θ) = 6 / (5 * √13)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(6 / (5 * √13))\n\nθ ≈ 0.969 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, multiply by (180/π):\n\nθ ≈ 0.969 * (180/π) ≈ 55.54 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors u and v is approximately 55.54 degrees."
