    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet. From the plane, a person observes a building on the ground at an angle of depression of 25 degrees. Determine the horizontal distance between the plane and the building. (Assume that the person and the building are at the same level.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have the angle of depression (25 degrees) and the altitude of the plane (10,000 feet). We can create a right triangle with the altitude as the opposite side, the horizontal distance as the adjacent side, and the angle of depression between them.\n\nLet's denote the horizontal distance as x. Using the tangent function, we have:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(25°) = 10,000 feet / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 10,000 feet / tan(25°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 10,000 feet / 0.4663\nx ≈ 21,428 feet\n\nSo, the horizontal distance between the plane and the building is approximately 21,428 feet."
