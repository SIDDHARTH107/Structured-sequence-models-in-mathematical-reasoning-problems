    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x for x between 0 and 5, we can first find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to 0.\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nThe critical point is x = 2. Now we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 5] and the critical point to determine the minimum value of f(x).\n\nf(0) = (0)^2 - 4(0) = 0\nf(2) = (2)^2 - 4(2) = 4 - 8 = -4\nf(5) = (5)^2 - 4(5) = 25 - 20 = 5\n\nComparing the values of f(x) at the endpoints and the critical point, we find that the minimum value of f(x) for x between 0 and 5 is -4, which occurs at x = 2."
