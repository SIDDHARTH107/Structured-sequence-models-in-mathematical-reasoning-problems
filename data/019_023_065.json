    "message_1": "The following is a problem for the math student to solve, based on Inductive Logic:\n\nA math teacher noticed that the first five students who entered the classroom each had a backpack on. Based on this observation, the teacher made the hypothesis that all students in the class would have backpacks on. Later, when the entire class had arrived, the teacher observed that only 80% of the students had backpacks. How many students were in the class?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the total number of students in the class as x. According to the problem, 80% of the students had backpacks. We can represent this as:\n\n0.8x = number of students with backpacks\n\nSince the first five students had backpacks, we know that at least 5 students had backpacks. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\n0.8x = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 5 / 0.8\nx = 6.25\n\nHowever, the number of students must be a whole number. Since 6 students would result in less than 80% having backpacks (5/6 = 83.3%), we need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7.\n\nSo, there were 7 students in the class."
