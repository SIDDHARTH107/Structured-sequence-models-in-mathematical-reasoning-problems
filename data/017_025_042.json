Determine the number of possible groups for each prime factor using the formula: n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1), where p is the prime factor and k is its exponent.\n\nFor 2^3:\nn_2 = (2^(3+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = (16 - 1) / 1 = 15\n\nFor 3:\nn_3 = (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = (9 - 1) / 2 = 4\n\nFor 5:\nn_5 = (5^(1+1) - 1) / (5 - 1) = (25 - 1) / 4 = 6\n\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: n = (n_p1 * n_p2 * ... * n_pk) / (p1 * p2 * ... * pk)\n\nn = (15 * 4 * 6) / (2 * 3 * 5) = 360 / 30 = 12\n\nThere are 12 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
