    "message_1": "A factory produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The total number of products made in a day is 200. The profit earned from each product is $10 for A, $15 for B, and $20 for C. The total profit earned in a day is $2950. However, due to noisy data, the number of products made for each type got disturbed by some random errors, which can be represented as a perturbation vector e = (1, -2, 3), where e is a column vector. Using linear algebra, find the actual number of products made for each type.",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z represent the actual number of products A, B, and C produced, respectively. We have the following system of linear equations:\n\nx + y + z = 200 (1) (Total number of products)\n10x + 15y + 20z = 2950 (2) (Total profit)\n\nDue to the perturbation vector e = (1, -2, 3), the observed number of products is (x+1, y-2, z+3). Thus, we have:\n\n(x+1) + (y-2) + (z+3) = 200\nx + y + z = 198 (3)\n\nNow, we can subtract equation (3) from equation (1) to find the relationship between the perturbation vector and the actual number of products:\n\n(1) - (3): 2 = 0, which is a contradiction.\n\nThis means that there is an error in the problem statement or the data provided. Please check the information given and provide the correct data to solve the problem."
