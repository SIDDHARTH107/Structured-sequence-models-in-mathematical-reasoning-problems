Find the rate at which the water level is rising when the height of the water is 4 feet. (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "Let V be the volume of the water in the tank and h be the height of the water. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nIn this case, the radius r is constant at 2 feet, so we can write the equation as:\n\nV = π(2^2)h\nV = 4πh\n\nNow, we are given that the water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 cubic feet per minute. This is the rate of change of the volume with respect to time, which can be written as dV/dt. So, we have:\n\ndV/dt = 3\n\nWe want to find the rate at which the water level is rising, which is the rate of change of the height with respect to time, or dh/dt. To find this, we can differentiate the equation for the volume with respect to time:\n\ndV/dt = d(4πh)/dt\ndV/dt = 4π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given value for dV/dt and solve for dh/dt:\n\n3 = 4π(dh/dt)\n\nTo find dh/dt when the height of the water is 4 feet, we can plug in h = 4:\n\n3 = 4π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = 3 / (4π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ 0.239 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the rate at which the water level is rising when the height of the water is 4 feet is approximately 0.239 feet per minute."
