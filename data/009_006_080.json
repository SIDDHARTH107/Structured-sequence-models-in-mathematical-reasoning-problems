    "message_2": "To find the concentration of reactant A after 20 minutes, we can use the first-order reaction equation:\n\nA_t = A_0 * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere A_t is the concentration of A at time t, A_0 is the initial concentration of A, k is the rate constant, and t is the time in minutes.\n\nGiven:\nA_0 = 0.1 M\nk = 0.05 min^-1\nt = 20 minutes\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nA_t = 0.1 * e^(-0.05 * 20)\n\nA_t = 0.1 * e^(-1)\n\nA_t ≈ 0.1 * 0.3679\n\nA_t ≈ 0.03679 M\n\nSo, the concentration of reactant A after 20 minutes is approximately 0.03679 M."
