    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x)*(2x - 5), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. \n\nLet u(x) = x^2 + 3x and v(x) = 2x - 5. \n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(u)/dx = d(x^2 + 3x)/dx = 2x + 3\nv'(x) = d(v)/dx = d(2x - 5)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (2x + 3)(2x - 5) + (x^2 + 3x)(2)\n\nNow, we expand the terms:\n\nf'(x) = (4x^2 - 10x + 6x - 15) + (2x^2 + 6x)\nf'(x) = 4x^2 - 4x - 15 + 2x^2 + 6x\n\nFinally, we combine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 2x - 15\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x)*(2x - 5) is f'(x) = 6x^2 + 2x - 15."
