    "message_2": "To find the complex Fourier series for f(t), we first need to find the Fourier coefficients, which are given by the following formula:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) ∫[-π,π] f(t) * e^(-int) dt\n\nwhere n is an integer, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nFor f(t) = sin(t) + cos(2t), we need to find the coefficients c_n for all integer values of n.\n\nc_n = (1/2π) ∫[-π,π] (sin(t) + cos(2t)) * e^(-int) dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) [∫[-π,π] sin(t) * e^(-int) dt + ∫[-π,π] cos(2t) * e^(-int) dt]\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n\n∫[-π,π] sin(t) * e^(-int) dt = ∫[-π,π] sin(t) * (cos(-nt) - i*sin(-nt)) dt\n= ∫[-π,π] (sin(t)*cos(-nt) - i*sin(t)*sin(-nt)) dt\n\nNow, we can split this integral into two parts:\n\n= ∫[-π,π] sin(t)*cos(-nt) dt - i*∫[-π,π] sin(t)*sin(-nt) dt\n\nUsing integration by parts, we find that both integrals are zero:\n\n∫[-π,π] sin(t)*cos(-nt) dt = 0\n∫[-π,π] sin(t)*sin(-nt) dt = 0\n\nSo, the first integral is zero.\n\nNow let's solve the second integral:\n\n∫[-π,π] cos(2t) * e^(-int) dt = ∫[-π,π] cos(2t) * (cos(-nt) - i*sin(-nt)) dt\n= ∫[-π,π] (cos(2t)*cos(-nt) - i*cos(2t)*sin(-nt)) dt\n\nAgain, we can split this integral into two parts:\n\n= ∫[-π,π] cos(2t)*cos(-nt) dt - i*∫[-π,π] cos(2t)*sin(-nt) dt\n\nUsing integration by parts, we find that the first integral is zero:\n\n∫[-π,π] cos(2t)*cos(-nt) dt = 0\n\nFor the second integral, we can use the product-to-sum formula:\n\ncos(2t)*sin(-nt) = 1/2 [sin(-nt - 2t) - sin(-nt + 2t)]\n\nSo, the second integral becomes:\n\n- i*∫[-π,π] cos(2t)*sin(-nt) dt = -i/2 * [∫[-π,π] sin(-nt - 2t) dt - ∫[-π,π] sin(-nt + 2t) dt]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we find that both integrals are zero:\n\n∫[-π,π] sin(-nt - 2t) dt = 0\n∫[-π,π] sin(-nt + 2t) dt = 0\n\nSo, the second integral is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier coefficients c_n are all zero:\n\nc_n = 0\n\nThe complex Fourier series for f(t) = sin(t) + cos(2t) is:\n\nf(t) = Σ c_n * e^(int) = 0\n\nThis means that the function f(t) = sin(t) + cos(2t) cannot be represented by a complex Fourier series."
