    "message_2": "A group of order 120 has the prime factorization 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime p dividing the order of the group must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nFor p = 2, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 3, and 15.\n\nFor p = 3, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 and 10.\n\nFor p = 5, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 1 and 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the three isomorphism types of groups of order 120:\n\n1. The cyclic group C_120: In this case, there is one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, as all the subgroups are unique.\n\n2. The direct product C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_3 × C_5: In this case, there are 7 Sylow 2-subgroups (1 normal subgroup and 6 non-normal subgroups), 4 Sylow 3-subgroups (1 normal subgroup and 3 non-normal subgroups), and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups (1 normal subgroup and 5 non-normal subgroups).\n\n3. The symmetric group S_5: In this case, there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nIn summary, the possible numbers of Sylow subgroups for a group of order 120 are:\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroups: 1, 3, or 15\n- Sylow 3-subgroups: 1 or 10\n- Sylow 5-subgroups: 1 or 6\n\nThe correspondences with the three isomorphism types of groups of order 120 are:\n\n1. C_120: 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, 1 Sylow 3-subgroup, 1 Sylow 5-subgroup\n2. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_3 × C_5: 7 Sylow 2-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, 6 Sylow 5-subgroups\n3. S_5: 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, 6 Sylow 5-subgroups"
