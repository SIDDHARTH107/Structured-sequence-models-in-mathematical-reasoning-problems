    "message_2": "Let $g(z) = \\frac{f(z)}{z+1}$. Then $|g(z)| = 1$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{-1\\}$. Since $g(z)$ is an entire function, it is continuous on $\\mathbb{C}$. By the continuity of $g(z)$, we have $|g(-1)| = 1$ as well.\n\nNow, consider the function $h(z) = g(z) - 1$. We have $|h(z)| = |g(z) - 1| = |g(z)| - 1 = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Since $h(z)$ is an entire function, it must be identically zero by the Identity Theorem. Thus, $g(z) = 1$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nFinally, we have $f(z) = g(z)(z+1) = (z+1)$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This function satisfies the given conditions, and it is the unique solution."
