    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear homogeneous equations using the Gaussian elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  1 -1 | 0\n| 1 -3  1 | 0\n| 4 -1  3 | 0\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get the matrix:\n\n| 1 -3  1 | 0\n| 2  1 -1 | 0\n| 4 -1  3 | 0\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and Row 3 with (-4 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n| 1 -3  1 | 0\n| 0  7 -3 | 0\n| 0 11 -1 | 0\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 7:\n\n| 1 -3  1 | 0\n| 0  1 -3/7 | 0\n| 0 11 -1 | 0\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 1 with (3 * Row 2) + Row 1 and Row 3 with (-11 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n| 1  0  4/7 | 0\n| 0  1 -3/7 | 0\n| 0  0 20/7 | 0\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by (20/7):\n\n| 1  0  4/7 | 0\n| 0  1 -3/7 | 0\n| 0  0   1  | 0\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the solutions.\n\nFrom the third equation, we have z = 0.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have y - (3/7)z = 0, which simplifies to y = 0.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have x + (4/7)z = 0, which simplifies to x = 0.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear homogeneous equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
