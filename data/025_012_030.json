    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of R = P + Q on the elliptic curve E, we will use the addition formula for elliptic curves. Let P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2). Then the slope λ (lambda) and the coordinates (x3, y3) of R = P + Q are given by:\n\n1. If P ≠ Q:\n   λ = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod p\n   x3 = (λ^2 - x1 - x2) mod p\n   y3 = (λ * (x1 - x3) - y1) mod p\n\n2. If P = Q:\n   λ = (3 * x1^2 + a) * (2 * y1)^(-1) mod p\n   x3 = (λ^2 - 2 * x1) mod p\n   y3 = (λ * (x1 - x3) - y1) mod p\n\nIn our case, P = (1, 3) and Q = (10, 5), so P ≠ Q. We will use the first set of formulas:\n\n1. Compute λ:\n   λ = (5 - 3) * (10 - 1)^(-1) mod 23\n   λ = 2 * 9^(-1) mod 23\n\nTo find the inverse of 9 modulo 23, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or try different numbers until we find the correct one. In this case, the inverse of 9 modulo 23 is 18 (since 9 * 18 ≡ 1 mod 23).\n\n   λ = 2 * 18 mod 23\n   λ = 36 mod 23\n   λ = 13\n\n2. Compute x3:\n   x3 = (13^2 - 1 - 10) mod 23\n   x3 = (169 - 11) mod 23\n   x3 = 158 mod 23\n   x3 = 2\n\n3. Compute y3:\n   y3 = (13 * (1 - 2) - 3) mod 23\n   y3 = (-13 - 3) mod 23\n   y3 = -16 mod 23\n   y3 = 7\n\nSo, the coordinates of R = P + Q on the elliptic curve E are R = (2, 7)."
