    "message_1": "Suppose a chaotic system is modeled by the following equation:\n\nx(t+1) = 4x(t)(1-x(t))\n\nwhere x(t) represents the state of the system at time t. Starting with an initial state of x(0) = 0.2, calculate the state of the system x(100) using a computer program or a graphing calculator. What do you observe about the behavior of the system over time? Does it exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions, in line with the butterfly effect?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the state of the system x(100), we can write a simple program or use a graphing calculator to iterate the equation 100 times, starting with x(0) = 0.2. Here's a Python code to do this:\n\n```python\nx = 0.2\nfor t in range(100):\n    x = 4 * x * (1 - x)\nprint(x)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get x(100) â‰ˆ 0.639143732.\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of the system over time. We can plot the values of x(t) for t = 0 to 100. Here's the Python code to do this using the matplotlib library:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx_values = [0.2]\nfor t in range(1, 101):\n    x = 4 * x_values[-1] * (1 - x_values[-1])\n    x_values.append(x)\n\nplt.plot(range(101), x_values)\nplt.xlabel('Time (t)')\nplt.ylabel('State (x(t))')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nFrom the plot, we can observe that the system exhibits chaotic behavior, with no apparent pattern or periodicity. The values of x(t) oscillate irregularly between 0 and 1.\n\nTo test the sensitivity to initial conditions, let's slightly perturb the initial state x(0) and see how the system evolves. We can set x(0) = 0.2001 and run the same code as before:\n\n```python\nx_perturbed = 0.2001\nx_values_perturbed = [x_perturbed]\nfor t in range(1, 101):\n    x_perturbed = 4 * x_values_perturbed[-1] * (1 - x_values_perturbed[-1])\n    x_values_perturbed.append(x_perturbed)\n\nplt.plot(range(101), x_values, label='x(0) = 0.2')\nplt.plot(range(101), x_values_perturbed, label='x(0) = 0.2001')\nplt.xlabel('Time (t)')\nplt.ylabel('State (x(t))')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nFrom the new plot, we can see that the two trajectories start to diverge significantly after a few iterations, even though their initial states were very close. This indicates that the system exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions, in line with the butterfly effect."
