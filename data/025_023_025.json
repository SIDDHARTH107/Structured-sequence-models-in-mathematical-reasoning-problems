    "message_1": "Let X be a complex algebraic variety of dimension d. Consider the intersection cohomology groups of X, denoted by IH^k(X) for k = 0, 1, ..., 2d. Suppose that IH^0(X) = IH^1(X) = 0 and IH^{2d}(X) = \\mathbb{Q}, the rational numbers. Prove that either IH^k(X) = 0 for all k, or there exists a unique k such that IH^k(X) = \\mathbb{Q}. Furthermore, determine the value of k in the latter case.",
    "message_2": "To prove the statement, we will use the Poincaré duality for intersection cohomology, which states that for a complex algebraic variety X of dimension d, there is a non-degenerate pairing:\n\nIH^k(X) ⊗ IH^{2d-k}(X) → IH^{2d}(X) = \\mathbb{Q}\n\nSince IH^0(X) = IH^1(X) = 0, the only possible non-zero intersection cohomology groups are for k = 2, 3, ..., 2d-1. We will now show that either all of these are zero, or there exists a unique k such that IH^k(X) = \\mathbb{Q}.\n\nSuppose there exists a non-zero intersection cohomology group IH^k(X) for some k. By Poincaré duality, this implies that IH^{2d-k}(X) is also non-zero. If there exists another non-zero intersection cohomology group IH^l(X) for l ≠ k, then by Poincaré duality, IH^{2d-l}(X) is also non-zero. However, this would mean that the pairing of IH^k(X) and IH^{2d-l}(X) would give a non-zero result in IH^{2d}(X) = \\mathbb{Q}, which is a contradiction since k + (2d - l) ≠ 2d. Therefore, there can be at most one non-zero intersection cohomology group IH^k(X) for k = 2, 3, ..., 2d-1.\n\nNow, let's determine the value of k in the case when there exists a unique non-zero intersection cohomology group IH^k(X) = \\mathbb{Q}. By Poincaré duality, we have:\n\nIH^k(X) ⊗ IH^{2d-k}(X) → \\mathbb{Q}\n\nSince IH^k(X) = \\mathbb{Q}, this implies that IH^{2d-k}(X) = \\mathbb{Q} as well. However, we know that there can be at most one non-zero intersection cohomology group, so we must have k = 2d - k. Solving for k, we get k = d.\n\nIn conclusion, either IH^k(X) = 0 for all k, or there exists a unique k such that IH^k(X) = \\mathbb{Q}, and in the latter case, k = d."
