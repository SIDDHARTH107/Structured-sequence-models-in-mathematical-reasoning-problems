    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive isotope has an activity of 50 Bq when it is created. The half-life of the isotope is 3 days. How long will it take for the activity of the sample to decrease to 6.25 Bq?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nA(t) = A0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nA(t) is the activity at time t,\nA0 is the initial activity (50 Bq),\nt is the time elapsed,\nT is the half-life of the isotope (3 days).\n\nWe want to find the time t when the activity A(t) is 6.25 Bq. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n6.25 = 50 * (1/2)^(t/3)\n\nNow, we need to solve for t. First, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:\n\n(6.25/50) = (1/2)^(t/3)\n\n0.125 = (1/2)^(t/3)\n\nTo solve for t, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation. We'll use the base 2 logarithm (log2) since the base of the exponent is 2:\n\nlog2(0.125) = log2((1/2)^(t/3))\n\nSince log2((1/2)^(t/3)) = (t/3) * log2(1/2), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog2(0.125) = (t/3) * log2(1/2)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by log2(1/2):\n\nt/3 = log2(0.125) / log2(1/2)\n\nt/3 = log2(0.125) / (-1)  [since log2(1/2) = -1]\n\nt/3 = -log2(0.125)\n\nt/3 = -(-3)  [since log2(0.125) = log2(1/8) = -3]\n\nt/3 = 3\n\nFinally, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of t:\n\nt = 3 * 3\n\nt = 9\n\nSo, it will take 9 days for the activity of the sample to decrease to 6.25 Bq."
