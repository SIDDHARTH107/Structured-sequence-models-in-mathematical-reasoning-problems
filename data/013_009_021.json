    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to the Matching Pennies game in Game Theory:\n\nPlayer A has two pennies; one with heads on both sides and the other with tails on both sides. Player B also has two pennies; one with heads and tails on opposite sides and the other with tails on both sides. If both players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their pennies, what is the probability that they will match (i.e. both will reveal heads or both will reveal tails)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of probability. We will first list all possible outcomes when both players choose and reveal one of their pennies. Then, we will count the number of outcomes where they match (both reveal heads or both reveal tails) and divide it by the total number of outcomes.\n\nPlayer A has two pennies: \n1. Heads-Heads (HH)\n2. Tails-Tails (TT)\n\nPlayer B has two pennies:\n1. Heads-Tails (HT)\n2. Tails-Tails (TT)\n\nNow, let's list all possible outcomes when both players reveal one of their pennies:\n\n1. Player A reveals HH, Player B reveals HT\n2. Player A reveals HH, Player B reveals TT\n3. Player A reveals TT, Player B reveals HT\n4. Player A reveals TT, Player B reveals TT\n\nOut of these 4 outcomes, let's identify the ones where they match:\n\n1. Player A reveals HH, Player B reveals HT (No match)\n2. Player A reveals HH, Player B reveals TT (Match - both reveal heads)\n3. Player A reveals TT, Player B reveals HT (No match)\n4. Player A reveals TT, Player B reveals TT (Match - both reveal tails)\n\nThere are 2 outcomes where they match out of a total of 4 outcomes. Therefore, the probability that they will match is:\n\nProbability = (Number of matching outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) = 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%."
