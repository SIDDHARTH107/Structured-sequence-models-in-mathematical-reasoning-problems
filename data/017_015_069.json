    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 24: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n2. Find the number of possible abelian groups of order 24 using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups: The number of abelian groups of order 24 is equal to the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. In this case, we have the following partitions:\n\n   For 2^3: (3), (2,1), (1,1,1)\n   For 3^1: (1)\n\n   Combining these partitions, we get the following abelian groups:\n\n   - Z_24 (partition (3,1))\n   - Z_8 x Z_3 (partition (2,1,1))\n   - Z_4 x Z_6 (partition (1,1,1,1))\n\n   So, there are 3 abelian groups of order 24.\n\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 24: To do this, we can use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 24, and let n_p be the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G.\n\n   - For p = 2, we have n_2 | 3 (by Sylow's second theorem) and n_2 = 1 mod 2 (by Sylow's third theorem). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, which implies that G is a semidirect product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and its Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, there are two possibilities: G ≅ Z_4 x Z_6 (which is abelian) or G ≅ Z_4 x_s Z_6 (which is non-abelian). If n_2 = 3, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups, and G is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_4.\n\n   - For p = 3, we have n_3 | 8 and n_3 = 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, which implies that G is a semidirect product of its Sylow 3-subgroup and its Sylow 2-subgroup. In this case, there are two possibilities: G ≅ Z_6 x Z_4 (which is abelian) or G ≅ Z_6 x_s Z_4 (which is non-abelian). If n_3 = 4, then G has four Sylow 3-subgroups, but this case does not yield any new non-abelian groups.\n\nSo, there are 2 non-abelian groups of order 24: Z_4 x_s Z_6 and S_4.\n\nIn total, there are 3 abelian groups + 2 non-abelian groups = 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
