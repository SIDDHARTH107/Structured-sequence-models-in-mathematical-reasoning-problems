    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 - 1 and y = 3 - x^2 over the interval [-2, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves.\n\nSet the two functions equal to each other:\n\nx^2 - 1 = 3 - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 4\n\nx^2 = 2\n\nx = ±√2\n\nThe points of intersection are at x = -√2 and x = √2. Now, we will integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [-√2, √2]:\n\nArea = ∫[-√2, √2] (3 - x^2 - (x^2 - 1)) dx\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫[-√2, √2] (4 - 2x^2) dx\n\nNow, integrate with respect to x:\n\nArea = [4x - (2/3)x^3] evaluated from -√2 to √2\n\nArea = (4√2 - (2/3)(√2)^3) - (4(-√2) - (2/3)(-√2)^3)\n\nArea = (4√2 - (8/3)(2)) - (-4√2 - (8/3)(2))\n\nArea = (4√2 - 16/3) - (-4√2 + 16/3)\n\nArea = 8√2 - 32/3 + 32/3\n\nArea = 8√2\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 - 1 and y = 3 - x^2 over the interval [-2, 2] is 8√2 square units."
