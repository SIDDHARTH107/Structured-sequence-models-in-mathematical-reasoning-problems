    "message_1": "A communication network consists of two components, a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter sends a signal to the receiver every second. The signal sent by the transmitter is a sine wave with frequency 10 Hz. The signal received by the receiver has a few distortions, which are represented by a signal with frequency components at 8 Hz, 12 Hz, and 15 Hz. \n\nWhat is the Fourier transform of the received signal?",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the received signal, we need to consider the individual frequency components of the signal. The received signal consists of the original 10 Hz sine wave and the additional frequency components at 8 Hz, 12 Hz, and 15 Hz.\n\nLet's represent the received signal as a sum of sine waves with different frequencies:\n\nx(t) = A1 * sin(2π * 10 * t) + A2 * sin(2π * 8 * t) + A3 * sin(2π * 12 * t) + A4 * sin(2π * 15 * t)\n\nwhere A1, A2, A3, and A4 are the amplitudes of the sine waves at frequencies 10 Hz, 8 Hz, 12 Hz, and 15 Hz, respectively, and t is time in seconds.\n\nThe Fourier transform of x(t) can be found by taking the Fourier transform of each individual sine wave and summing them up. The Fourier transform of a sine wave is given by:\n\nF{sin(2π * f * t)} = (1/2j) * (δ(f - f0) - δ(f + f0))\n\nwhere F is the Fourier transform, f is the frequency, f0 is the frequency of the sine wave, and δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of each sine wave in the received signal:\n\nF1 = F{A1 * sin(2π * 10 * t)} = (A1/2j) * (δ(f - 10) - δ(f + 10))\nF2 = F{A2 * sin(2π * 8 * t)} = (A2/2j) * (δ(f - 8) - δ(f + 8))\nF3 = F{A3 * sin(2π * 12 * t)} = (A3/2j) * (δ(f - 12) - δ(f + 12))\nF4 = F{A4 * sin(2π * 15 * t)} = (A4/2j) * (δ(f - 15) - δ(f + 15))\n\nThe Fourier transform of the received signal x(t) is the sum of these individual Fourier transforms:\n\nF{x(t)} = F1 + F2 + F3 + F4\n        = (A1/2j) * (δ(f - 10) - δ(f + 10)) + (A2/2j) * (δ(f - 8) - δ(f + 8)) + (A3/2j) * (δ(f - 12) - δ(f + 12)) + (A4/2j) * (δ(f - 15) - δ(f + 15))\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the received signal, which represents the frequency components of the signal in the frequency domain."
