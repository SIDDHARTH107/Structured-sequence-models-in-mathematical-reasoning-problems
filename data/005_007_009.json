    "message_2": "The correlation coefficient (r) between two variables X and Y can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr = Cov(X, Y) / (σ_X * σ_Y)\n\nwhere Cov(X, Y) is the covariance between X and Y, and σ_X and σ_Y are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively.\n\nGiven the standard deviations σ_X = 4 and σ_Y = 5, and the covariance Cov(X, Y) = 10, we can calculate the correlation coefficient as follows:\n\nr = 10 / (4 * 5)\nr = 10 / 20\nr = 0.5\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the two variables X and Y is 0.5."
