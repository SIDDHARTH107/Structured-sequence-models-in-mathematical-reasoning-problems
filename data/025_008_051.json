    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials on $X$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle $L$ on a smooth projective surface $X$ with canonical bundle $K_X$, we have:\n\n$$\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) + h^2(X, L) = \\frac{1}{2}L\\cdot (L - K_X) + \\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X),\n$$\n\nwhere $h^i(X, L) = \\dim H^i(X, L)$, and $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X)$ is the Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf of $X$.\n\nIn our case, we are interested in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials, which corresponds to the line bundle $L = K_X^2$. Therefore, we need to compute the intersection numbers $K_X^2 \\cdot K_X^2$ and $K_X^2 \\cdot K_X$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the canonical bundle $K_X$. The given variety is a smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$, which is a degree 2 hypersurface. The canonical bundle of a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C})$ is given by $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(n+1-d)$. In our case, $n = 2$ and $d = 2$, so $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$.\n\nNow, we compute the intersection numbers. Since $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$, we have $K_X^2 = \\mathcal{O}_X(2)$. The intersection numbers are then:\n\n$$\nK_X^2 \\cdot K_X^2 = 2^2 = 4,\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nK_X^2 \\cdot K_X = 2.\n$$\n\nFinally, we need to compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X)$. For a smooth projective surface, this is given by the topological Euler characteristic divided by 2. The topological Euler characteristic of a smooth quadric surface is 4, so $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = 4/2 = 2$.\n\nPlugging these values into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\n$$\nh^0(X, K_X^2) - h^1(X, K_X^2) + h^2(X, K_X^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(4) + 2 = 4.\n$$\n\nSince $X$ is a smooth projective surface, we have $h^1(X, K_X^2) = 0$ and $h^2(X, K_X^2) = 0$. Therefore, the dimension of the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials on $X$ is $h^0(X, K_X^2) = 4$."
