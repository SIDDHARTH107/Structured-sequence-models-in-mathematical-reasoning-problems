    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation 5x + 7y = 41, we can first find one particular solution and then use the general formula for Diophantine equations to find all solutions.\n\nStep 1: Find one particular solution\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution. However, in this case, we can find a solution by trial and error:\n\nLet x = 3, then we have:\n5(3) + 7y = 41\n15 + 7y = 41\n7y = 26\ny = 26/7\n\nSince y is not an integer, we can try another value for x:\n\nLet x = 4, then we have:\n5(4) + 7y = 41\n20 + 7y = 41\n7y = 21\ny = 3\n\nNow we have a particular solution: (x, y) = (4, 3).\n\nStep 2: Use the general formula for Diophantine equations\nThe general formula for the solutions of a Diophantine equation of the form ax + by = c, given one particular solution (x0, y0), is:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere d = gcd(a, b) and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 5, b = 7, and d = gcd(5, 7) = 1 (since 5 and 7 are both prime numbers). Our particular solution is (x0, y0) = (4, 3). So the general formula for our equation is:\n\nx = 4 + 7n\ny = 3 - 5n\n\nNow we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for n:\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (4, 3)\nn = 1: (x, y) = (11, -2)\nn = -1: (x, y) = (-3, 8)\nn = 2: (x, y) = (18, -7)\n...\n\nSo the integer solutions to the equation 5x + 7y = 41 are given by (x, y) = (4 + 7n, 3 - 5n) for any integer n."
