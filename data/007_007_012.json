    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 3x + 5y = 37 for positive integers x and y, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the general solution and then find the specific solution with positive integers.\n\nFirst, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 5 using the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n5 = 1 * 3 + 2\n3 = 1 * 2 + 1\n\nNow, we can express the GCD (1) as a linear combination of 3 and 5:\n\n1 = 3 - 1 * 2\n1 = 3 - 1 * (5 - 1 * 3)\n1 = 2 * 3 - 1 * 5\n\nSo, the general solution for the Diophantine equation 3x + 5y = 37 can be written as:\n\n37 = 37 * (2 * 3 - 1 * 5)\n\nNow, we need to find the specific solution with positive integers x and y:\n\n37 = 2 * 3 * 37 - 1 * 5 * 37\n37 = 222 - 185\n37 = 3 * 74 - 5 * 37\n\nSo, the specific solution with positive integers x and y is:\n\nx = 74\ny = 37"
