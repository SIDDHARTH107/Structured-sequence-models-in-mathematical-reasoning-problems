    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (edge length)^2\n\nIn this case, the edge length is 7 cm. So, the surface area would be:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (7 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 6 * 49 cm^2\nSurface Area = 294 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 294 square centimeters."
