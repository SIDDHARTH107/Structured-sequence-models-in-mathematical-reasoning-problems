    "message_2": "To show that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of each set, we first need to find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, can be found as follows:\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of set A and set B, we can see that the common elements are 3, 4, and 5.\n\nSo, A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∩ B is a subset of both set A and set B. A set C is a subset of set D (denoted as C ⊆ D) if every element of C is also an element of D.\n\n1. A ∩ B ⊆ A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element of A. Since A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}, and all these elements are present in set A, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\n2. A ∩ B ⊆ B:\n\nSimilarly, for every element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element of B. Since A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}, and all these elements are present in set B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and set B, A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}, is a subset of each set A and B."
