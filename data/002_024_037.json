    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8cm, parallel sides of length 12cm and 18cm. What is its perimeter?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of these sides. Since the trapezium is not an isosceles trapezium, we need to split it into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter base to the longer base.\n\nLet's call the length of this perpendicular line x. Now we have two right triangles: one with legs of length 8 cm and x, and the other with legs of length 8 cm and (18 - x).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the first right triangle:\na^2 = 8^2 + x^2\n\nAnd for the second right triangle:\nb^2 = 8^2 + (18 - x)^2\n\nNow we need to find x. Since the height of the trapezium is 8 cm, we can use the area formula for a trapezium to find x:\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 18) * 8\nArea = 120 cm^2\n\nWe can also express the area in terms of x:\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * (x + (18 - x))\n120 = (1/2) * 8 * 18\n120 = 72\nx = 6 cm\n\nNow we can find the length of a and b:\na^2 = 8^2 + 6^2\na^2 = 64 + 36\na^2 = 100\na = 10 cm\n\nb^2 = 8^2 + (18 - 6)^2\nb^2 = 64 + 144\nb^2 = 208\nb ≈ 14.42 cm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\nPerimeter = a + b + 12 + 18\nPerimeter = 10 + 14.42 + 12 + 18\nPerimeter ≈ 54.42 cm (rounded to two decimal places)"
