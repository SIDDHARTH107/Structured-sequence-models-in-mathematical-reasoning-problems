    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition between two firms. Firm 1 is the leader and sets their quantity first, followed by Firm 2. The demand function for the market is given by P=200-Q, where P is price and Q is total quantity produced. The cost functions are C1=50Q1, and C2=100Q2. What is the Stackelberg equilibrium quantity and price for both firms?",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg equilibrium, we need to first find the reaction function of Firm 2, which is the quantity that Firm 2 will produce given the quantity produced by Firm 1. Then, we will find the optimal quantity for Firm 1 to produce, taking into account Firm 2's reaction function. Finally, we will find the equilibrium price.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function of Firm 2\nFirm 2's profit function is given by:\nπ2 = P*Q2 - C2\nπ2 = (200 - Q)*Q2 - 100Q2\nπ2 = (200 - Q1 - Q2)*Q2 - 100Q2\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 2 will choose Q2 such that the derivative of its profit function with respect to Q2 is equal to zero:\ndπ2/dQ2 = 200 - 2Q2 - Q1 - 100 = 0\n\nSolving for Q2, we get Firm 2's reaction function:\nQ2 = (100 - Q1)/2\n\nStep 2: Find the optimal quantity for Firm 1\nFirm 1's profit function is given by:\nπ1 = P*Q1 - C1\nπ1 = (200 - Q)*Q1 - 50Q1\nπ1 = (200 - Q1 - Q2)*Q1 - 50Q1\n\nSubstitute Firm 2's reaction function into Firm 1's profit function:\nπ1 = (200 - Q1 - (100 - Q1)/2)*Q1 - 50Q1\nπ1 = (300 - 3Q1/2)*Q1 - 50Q1\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 1 will choose Q1 such that the derivative of its profit function with respect to Q1 is equal to zero:\ndπ1/dQ1 = 300 - 3Q1 - 50 = 0\n\nSolving for Q1, we get the optimal quantity for Firm 1:\nQ1 = 250/3 ≈ 83.33\n\nStep 3: Find the equilibrium quantity for Firm 2\nUsing Firm 2's reaction function, we can find the equilibrium quantity for Firm 2:\nQ2 = (100 - Q1)/2\nQ2 = (100 - 250/3)/2 ≈ 16.67\n\nStep 4: Find the equilibrium price\nUsing the demand function, we can find the equilibrium price:\nP = 200 - Q\nP = 200 - (Q1 + Q2)\nP = 200 - (83.33 + 16.67)\nP = 200 - 100\nP = 100\n\nSo, the Stackelberg equilibrium quantities are Q1 ≈ 83.33 and Q2 ≈ 16.67, and the equilibrium price is P = 100."
