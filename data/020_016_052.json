    "message_1": "A rectangular steel plate is 10 cm wide and 20 cm long. What are the dimensions of the square cutout that could be made such that the resulting plate has the highest possible area? (Assume the cutout is done at the center of the plate)",
    "message_2": "Let the side length of the square cutout be x cm. Since the cutout is made at the center of the plate, the remaining plate will have two rectangles on the longer sides and two rectangles on the shorter sides.\n\nThe dimensions of the two rectangles on the longer sides will be (20 - x) cm by 10 cm each, and the dimensions of the two rectangles on the shorter sides will be x cm by (10 - x) cm each.\n\nThe total area of the remaining plate (A) can be calculated as follows:\n\nA = 2 * (20 - x) * 10 + 2 * x * (10 - x)\n\nA = 2 * (200 - 10x) + 2 * (10x - x^2)\n\nA = 400 - 20x + 20x - 2x^2\n\nA = 400 - 2x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can find the vertex of the parabola represented by the equation above. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = -2 and b = 0.\n\nx_vertex = -0 / (2 * -2) = 0\n\nHowever, a cutout with side length 0 is not possible. Since the width of the plate is 10 cm, the maximum side length of the square cutout should be less than 10 cm. The cutout should be as large as possible without affecting the area of the two rectangles on the longer sides. Therefore, the maximum side length of the square cutout should be slightly less than 10 cm, leaving a very thin rectangle on the longer sides.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the square cutout that could be made such that the resulting plate has the highest possible area are approximately 10 cm by 10 cm."
