    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 7 \\\\\n-1 & 3 & 2 & 8 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 3 & 15\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Add the first row to the second row to eliminate $x_1$ from the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 7 \\\\\n0 & 5 & 1 & 15 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 3 & 15\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n2. Subtract twice the first row from the third row to eliminate $x_1$ from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 7 \\\\\n0 & 5 & 1 & 15 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 5 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n3. Divide the second row by 5 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 7 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1/5 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 5 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n4. Add twice the second row to the third row to eliminate $x_2$ from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 7 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1/5 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 21/5 & 7\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n5. Divide the third row by 21/5 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 7 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1/5 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 5/3\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the solutions for $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$:\n\n1. From the third row, we have $x_3 = 5/3$.\n\n2. From the second row, we have $x_2 + (1/5)(5/3) = 3 \\Rightarrow x_2 = 3 - (1/3) = 8/3$.\n\n3. From the first row, we have $x_1 + 2(8/3) - (5/3) = 7 \\Rightarrow x_1 = 7 - (16/3) + (5/3) = 6/3 = 2$.\n\nSo, the solutions for the given system of linear equations are $x_1 = 2$, $x_2 = 8/3$, and $x_3 = 5/3$."
