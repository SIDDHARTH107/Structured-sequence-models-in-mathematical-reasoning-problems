    "message_2": "To find the angle between the two planes, we can use the dot product formula for vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||)\n\nwhere A and B are the velocity vectors of the two planes, θ is the angle between them, and ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nFirst, we need to find the components of the velocity vectors A and B.\n\nFor the first plane (A):\nAx = 450 * cos(30°) = 450 * (√3 / 2) = 225√3\nAy = 450 * sin(30°) = 450 * (1 / 2) = 225\n\nFor the second plane (B):\nBx = 500 * cos(60°) = 500 * (1 / 2) = 250\nBy = 500 * sin(60°) = 500 * (√3 / 2) = 250√3\n\nNow, we can find the dot product (A · B) and the magnitudes of the vectors ||A|| and ||B||.\n\nA · B = Ax * Bx + Ay * By = (225√3 * 250) + (225 * 250√3) = 56250√3 + 56250√3 = 112500√3\n\n||A|| = √(Ax^2 + Ay^2) = √((225√3)^2 + 225^2) = √(30375 + 50625) = √81000 = 450√2\n\n||B|| = √(Bx^2 + By^2) = √(250^2 + (250√3)^2) = √(62500 + 187500) = √250000 = 500\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||) = (112500√3) / (450√2 * 500) = (√3) / √2\n\nθ = arccos(√3 / √2) ≈ 35.26°\n\nSo, the angle between the two planes is approximately 35.26°."
