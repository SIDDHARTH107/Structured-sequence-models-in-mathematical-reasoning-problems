The payoff matrix is as follows:\n\nPlayer 1/Player 2 | X | Y \n--- | --- | --- \nA | 4 | 2 \nB | 3 | 5 \nC | 1 | 4 \n\nIf both players play optimally, what is the Nash equilibrium of the game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best responses for each player given the other player's strategy. A Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are playing their best response.\n\nFirst, let's find the best responses for Player 1 given Player 2's strategies:\n\nIf Player 2 plays X:\n- Player 1 gets a payoff of 4 with strategy A\n- Player 1 gets a payoff of 3 with strategy B\n- Player 1 gets a payoff of 1 with strategy C\nThe best response for Player 1 is strategy A.\n\nIf Player 2 plays Y:\n- Player 1 gets a payoff of 2 with strategy A\n- Player 1 gets a payoff of 5 with strategy B\n- Player 1 gets a payoff of 4 with strategy C\nThe best response for Player 1 is strategy B.\n\nNow, let's find the best responses for Player 2 given Player 1's strategies:\n\nIf Player 1 plays A:\n- Player 2 gets a payoff of 4 with strategy X\n- Player 2 gets a payoff of 2 with strategy Y\nThe best response for Player 2 is strategy X.\n\nIf Player 1 plays B:\n- Player 2 gets a payoff of 3 with strategy X\n- Player 2 gets a payoff of 5 with strategy Y\nThe best response for Player 2 is strategy Y.\n\nIf Player 1 plays C:\n- Player 2 gets a payoff of 1 with strategy X\n- Player 2 gets a payoff of 4 with strategy Y\nThe best response for Player 2 is strategy Y.\n\nNow, let's find the Nash equilibrium by looking for the combination of strategies where both players are playing their best response:\n\n- If Player 1 plays A and Player 2 plays X, both players are playing their best response. This is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nThere is one Nash equilibrium in this game: (A, X) with payoffs (4, 4) for Player 1 and Player 2, respectively."
