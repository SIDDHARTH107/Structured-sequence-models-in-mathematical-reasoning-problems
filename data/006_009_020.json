    "message_1": "A certain medical test for a disease has a 98% sensitivity and 85% specificity. If a patient really has the disease, what is the probability that the test will show a positive result?",
    "message_2": "The sensitivity of a medical test measures the proportion of true positive results among the patients who actually have the disease. In this case, the sensitivity is 98%. Therefore, if a patient really has the disease, the probability that the test will show a positive result is 98%."
