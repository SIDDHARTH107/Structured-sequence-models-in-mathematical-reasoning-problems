    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake curve is formed by iterating the Koch curve construction process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nLet L_n be the length of the curve after n iterations. Then, L_n = (4/3)^n * L_0, where L_0 is the initial length of the line segment (3 cm in this case).\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the length of the Koch snowflake curve is:\n\nL_4 = (4/3)^4 * 3 cm\n\nL_4 ≈ 6.5616 * 3 cm\n\nL_4 ≈ 19.6848 cm\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after four iterations is approximately 19.6848 cm."
