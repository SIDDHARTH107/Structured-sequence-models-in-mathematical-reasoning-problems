    "message_1": "If a tetrahedron is subdivided into smaller tetrahedrons by adding vertices at the midpoints of its edges, how many total tetrahedrons will there be after the subdivision?",
    "message_2": "When a tetrahedron is subdivided by adding vertices at the midpoints of its edges, it creates four smaller tetrahedrons. One tetrahedron is formed at the center, and the other three are formed by connecting the midpoints of the edges to the original vertices. So, there will be a total of 4 tetrahedrons after the subdivision."
