    "message_1": "Here's a matching pennies problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you and a friend are playing the matching pennies game. Each of you starts with $10 to bet. You both secretly choose a side of the coin to reveal simultaneously. If the sides match, your friend gives you $1, otherwise you give your friend $1. The game is played for 20 rounds. \n\nAssuming both you and your friend play optimally, what is the highest expected profit you can achieve from this game?",
    "message_2": "In the matching pennies game, if both players play optimally, they will choose each side of the coin with a probability of 1/2. This means that the expected outcome of each round is a 50% chance of winning $1 and a 50% chance of losing $1.\n\nSince the game is played for 20 rounds, the expected profit for each round is:\n\n(1/2) * $1 + (1/2) * (-$1) = $0.5 - $0.5 = $0\n\nAs the expected profit for each round is $0, the highest expected profit you can achieve from this game after 20 rounds is also $0. This is because, when both players play optimally, the game becomes a fair game with no advantage for either player."
