    "message_2": "To encrypt a message using RSA, you need to perform the following calculation:\n\nciphertext = (plaintext^e) mod n\n\nIn this case, the plaintext is 42, e is 5, and n is 323. So the calculation would be:\n\nciphertext = (42^5) mod 323\n\nFirst, calculate 42^5:\n\n42^5 = 130691232\n\nNow, find the remainder when dividing by 323:\n\n130691232 mod 323 = 105\n\nSo, the ciphertext is 105."
