    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1}\nB - A = {4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of each set. The complement of a set A is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nA' = U - A = {5, 6}\nB' = U - B = {1, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complements A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' - B') ∪ (B' - A')\n\nA' - B' = {6}\nB' - A' = {1}\n\nA' ∆ B' = {6} ∪ {1} = {1, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference A ∆ B:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {2, 3, 5, 6}\n\nComparing the symmetric difference of the complements A' ∆ B' and the complement of the symmetric difference (A ∆ B)', we see that they are not equal:\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 6}\n(A ∆ B)' = {2, 3, 5, 6}\n\nThus, the symmetric difference of the complements is not equal to the complement of the symmetric difference."
