    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that increases in length with each iteration. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (Length Multiplier)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations and the length multiplier for the Gosper curve is approximately 2.10433.\n\nGiven that the initial length of the curve is 1 unit, we can calculate the total length of the Gosper curve after the 6th iteration as follows:\n\nLength = 1 * (2.10433)^6\nLength ≈ 1 * 64.6501\nLength ≈ 64.6501 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after the 6th iteration is approximately 64.6501 units."
