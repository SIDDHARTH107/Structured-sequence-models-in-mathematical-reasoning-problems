    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the letter \"e\" in the cipher text, we first need to determine the total number of letters in the text. The cipher text has 42 characters, including spaces and punctuation. Removing spaces and punctuation, we have 35 letters.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of times the letter \"e\" appears in the text. Since this is a cipher text, the letter \"e\" is likely to be represented by a different letter. Using the hint that \"e\" is the most commonly used letter in the English language with a frequency of approximately 12.7%, we can look for the most frequent letter in the cipher text.\n\nHere's the frequency of each letter in the cipher text:\n\nZ: 1, p: 2, x: 1, r: 3, n: 2, e: 1, y: 3, v: 1, l: 2, h: 1, b: 2, w: 3, i: 1, a: 1, s: 1, k: 1\n\nThe most frequent letters in the cipher text are \"r\", \"y\", and \"w\", each appearing 3 times. Since we don't have enough information to determine which of these letters represents \"e\" in the cipher, we can't provide an exact frequency for the letter \"e\" in this cipher text."
