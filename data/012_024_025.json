    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn this case, V = 8 and E = 12. We need to find the minimum number of faces (F) for which the graph can be embedded on a surface of genus g without any edge crossings.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of edges (E_max) for a planar graph with 8 vertices:\n\nE_max = 3V - 6 = 3 * 8 - 6 = 18\n\nSince our graph has 12 edges, which is less than E_max, it is possible that the graph is planar (g = 0). However, we need to check if there exists a planar embedding of the graph.\n\nLet's assume the graph is planar and try to find the number of faces (F). Using the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nF = 2 - V + E = 2 - 8 + 12 = 6\n\nNow, let's use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\n12 ≤ 3 * 8 - 6\n\n12 ≤ 18\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, we cannot guarantee that the graph is planar without knowing its specific structure. If the graph is planar, then the genus is 0.\n\nIf the graph is not planar, we can try to find the genus by increasing the genus value (g) and checking if the Euler's formula holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nFor g = 1:\n\nF = 2 - 8 + 12 + 2 = 8\n\nNow, let's use the inequality for graphs with genus 1:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6\n\n12 ≤ 3 * 8 + 6\n\n12 ≤ 30\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph can be embedded on a surface of genus 1.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we can conclude that the genus of the graph is either 0 (if the graph is planar) or 1 (if the graph is non-planar)."
