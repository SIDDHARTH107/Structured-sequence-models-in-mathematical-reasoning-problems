    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the partial derivatives of the function with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2. Then,\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1,1,2):\n\n∂f/∂x(1,1) = 2(1) = 2\n∂f/∂y(1,1) = 2(1) = 2\n\nThe gradient vector of the function at the point (1,1,2) is given by the vector (2, 2, -1), where the -1 comes from the fact that the z-component of the gradient vector is -1 for a surface equation of the form z = f(x, y).\n\nNow, we can use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane, which is given by:\n\nA(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector to the plane (in this case, the gradient vector), and (x0, y0, z0) is the point on the plane (in this case, (1,1,2)).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) - 1(z - 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we obtain the equation of the tangent plane:\n\n2x + 2y - z = 1"
