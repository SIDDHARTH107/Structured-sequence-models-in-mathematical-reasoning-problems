    "message_2": "To find a group of order 35, we can use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 35 = 5 * 7, we know that the group G must have a 5-Sylow subgroup P and a 7-Sylow subgroup Q.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G is congruent to 1 mod 5 and divides 7. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups in G is congruent to 1 mod 7 and divides 5. The only possibility in both cases is that there is exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup and one 7-Sylow subgroup.\n\nSince there is only one 5-Sylow subgroup P, it must be normal in G. Similarly, the 7-Sylow subgroup Q is also normal in G. Now, let's consider the intersection of P and Q. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime (5 and 7 are prime and do not share any factors), their intersection must be the identity element.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that P and Q are both normal in G and their intersection is trivial to show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. Let's consider the function φ: P × Q → G defined by φ(p, q) = pq for all p in P and q in Q. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since P and Q are normal in G, their product pq is well-defined for all p in P and q in Q.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) be elements of P × Q. Then φ((p1, q1)(p2, q2)) = φ(p1p2, q1q2) = p1p2q1q2. Since P and Q commute (because their intersection is trivial), we can rewrite this as p1q1p2q2 = φ(p1, q1)φ(p2, q2). Thus, φ is a homomorphism.\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(p, q) = e, where e is the identity element in G. Then pq = e, which implies that p = q^(-1). Since p is in P and q^(-1) is in Q, their intersection is trivial, so p = q^(-1) = e. Thus, the kernel of φ is trivial, and φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: Since the orders of P and Q are 5 and 7, respectively, the order of P × Q is 5 * 7 = 35, which is the same as the order of G. Since φ is a homomorphism from P × Q to G and both groups have the same order, φ must be surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined, injective, surjective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively."
