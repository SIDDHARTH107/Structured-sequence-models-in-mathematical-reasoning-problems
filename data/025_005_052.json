    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety $V(f)$, we need to find the points where both the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ are zero. So, we first compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3ay$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3ax$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3ay = 0$\n\n$3y^2 - 3ax = 0$\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\n$x^2 - ay = 0$\n\n$y^2 - ax = 0$\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $x = 0$ and $y = 0$\n\nIn this case, both equations are satisfied, so $(0, 0)$ is a singular point.\n\nCase 2: $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$\n\nIn this case, we can divide the first equation by $x$ and the second equation by $y$:\n\n$x - a\\frac{y}{x} = 0$\n\n$y - a\\frac{x}{y} = 0$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equations:\n\n$a = \\frac{x^2}{y}$\n\n$a = \\frac{y^2}{x}$\n\nNow, we can equate the expressions for $a$:\n\n$\\frac{x^2}{y} = \\frac{y^2}{x}$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$x^3 = y^3$\n\nSince $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$, we can take the cube root of both sides:\n\n$x = y$\n\nNow, substituting $x = y$ into either equation for $a$, we get:\n\n$a = x$\n\nSo, the singular points are of the form $(x, x)$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. However, we need to check if these points satisfy $f(x, x) = 0$. Substituting $x = y$ into $f(x, y)$, we get:\n\n$f(x, x) = x^3 + x^3 - 3ax^2 = 2x^3 - 3ax^2$\n\nSince $a = x$, we have:\n\n$f(x, x) = 2x^3 - 3x^3 = -x^3$\n\nFor $x = 0$, we have $f(0, 0) = 0$, so $(0, 0)$ is a singular point. For $x \\neq 0$, we have $f(x, x) = -x^3 \\neq 0$, so there are no other singular points.\n\nTherefore, the only singular point of the algebraic variety $V(f)$ is $(0, 0)$."
