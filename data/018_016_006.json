    "message_2": "To prove that AxB ≠ BxA with respect to union, we will first find the Cartesian products AxB and BxA, and then show that their unions are not equal.\n\nThe Cartesian product AxB is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, AxB = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}.\n\nSimilarly, the Cartesian product BxA is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, BxA = {(2, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)}.\n\nNow, let's find the union of AxB and BxA. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the two sets.\n\nUnion(AxB, BxA) = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (2, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)}\n\nWe can clearly see that the ordered pairs in AxB are not the same as the ordered pairs in BxA. Specifically, the pairs (1, 2) and (2, 1) are different, as are the pairs (1, 4) and (4, 1), (3, 2) and (2, 3), and (3, 4) and (4, 3).\n\nTherefore, AxB ≠ BxA with respect to union."
