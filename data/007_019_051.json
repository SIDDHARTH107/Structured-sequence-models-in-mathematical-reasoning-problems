    "message_2": "We are looking for the smallest prime number P greater than 100, such that P = p1 + p2, where p1 and p2 are prime numbers.\n\nLet's start by listing the prime numbers greater than 100:\n\n101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, ...\n\nNow, let's check if any of these prime numbers can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers:\n\n101 = 2 + 99 (99 is not prime)\n103 = 3 + 100 (100 is not prime)\n107 = 2 + 105 (105 is not prime)\n109 = 2 + 107 (2 and 107 are both prime)\n\nThus, the smallest prime number greater than 100 that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers is 109, with the prime numbers being 2 and 107."
