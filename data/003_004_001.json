    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos(x) = √2 for x, where x is between 0 and 2π, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by 2:\ncos(x) = (√2)/2\n\n2. Now, we need to find the angles x for which the cosine function equals (√2)/2. Recall that the cosine function has a periodicity of 2π, so we only need to consider the interval [0, 2π].\n\n3. The angles x for which cos(x) = (√2)/2 are x = π/4 and x = 7π/4. These angles are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively, where the cosine function is positive.\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 2cos(x) = √2 for x in the interval [0, 2π] are x = π/4 and x = 7π/4."
