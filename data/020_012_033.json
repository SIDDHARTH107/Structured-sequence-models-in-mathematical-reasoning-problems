The production of Model A requires 6 hours of labor and $300 worth of materials, while Model B requires 8 hours of labor and $400 worth of materials. The company has 48 hours of labor and $3000 for materials to use in total. Model A sells for $800 and Model B sells for $1000. Determine the number of each model the company should produce to maximize their profit.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can make, and how many of each model should they produce to achieve it?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Model A televisions and y be the number of Model B televisions.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 6x + 8y ≤ 48 (hours)\n2. Material constraint: 300x + 400y ≤ 3000 (dollars)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 800x + 1000y.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y ≤ (48 - 6x) / 8\n2. Material constraint: y ≤ (3000 - 300x) / 400\n\nNow we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by setting the constraints equal to each other:\n\n1. (48 - 6x) / 8 = (3000 - 300x) / 400\n2. 48 - 6x = 60 - 3x\n3. x = 4\n\nSubstitute x = 4 back into the labor constraint:\n\ny ≤ (48 - 6(4)) / 8\ny ≤ 3\n\nSo the feasible region has vertices at (0, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), and (0, 6).\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 800(0) + 1000(0) = $0\n2. P(4, 0) = 800(4) + 1000(0) = $3200\n3. P(4, 3) = 800(4) + 1000(3) = $6200\n4. P(0, 6) = 800(0) + 1000(6) = $6000\n\nThe maximum profit is $6200, which occurs when the company produces 4 Model A televisions and 3 Model B televisions."
