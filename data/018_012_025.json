    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B. A × B consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∩ {1}. The intersection of (A × B) and {1} would be the set of elements that are common to both sets. However, {1} is a set of single elements, while (A × B) is a set of ordered pairs. There are no common elements between these two sets.\n\n(A × B) ∩ {1} = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNext, let's find ({1} × A) and then the intersection with B. The Cartesian product {1} × A consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ {1} and b ∈ A.\n\n{1} × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find (({1} × A) ∩ B). The intersection of ({1} × A) and B would be the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there is one common element:\n\n(({1} × A) ∩ B) = {(1, 2)}\n\nNow, we can see that (A × B) ∩ {1} ≠ (({1} × A) ∩ B), as the first is the empty set and the second is a set containing the ordered pair (1, 2). This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
