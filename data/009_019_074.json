If the current stock price is $50, what is the probability that the stock price will exceed $60 in the next 3 months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of geometric Brownian motion and the Black-Scholes formula. The given stochastic differential equation (SDE) is:\n\ndS = μSdt + σSdW\n\nwhere μ = 0.1 (drift), σ = 0.2 (volatility), and dW is the increment of a standard Brownian motion.\n\nFirst, we need to find the expected value and variance of the stock price after 3 months (0.25 years). For a geometric Brownian motion, the expected value and variance of the stock price at time t are given by:\n\nE[S(t)] = S(0) * exp(μt)\nVar[S(t)] = S(0)^2 * exp(2μt) * (exp(σ^2 * t) - 1)\n\nwhere S(0) is the initial stock price, which is $50 in this case.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nE[S(0.25)] = 50 * exp(0.1 * 0.25) ≈ 51.28\nVar[S(0.25)] = 50^2 * exp(2 * 0.1 * 0.25) * (exp(0.2^2 * 0.25) - 1) ≈ 132.60\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the stock price will exceed $60 in the next 3 months. To do this, we can standardize the stock price and use the standard normal distribution. Let Z be the standardized stock price:\n\nZ = (S(t) - E[S(t)]) / sqrt(Var[S(t)])\n\nWe want to find P(S(t) > 60), which is equivalent to finding P(Z > (60 - E[S(t)]) / sqrt(Var[S(t)])):\n\nP(Z > (60 - 51.28) / sqrt(132.60)) ≈ P(Z > 0.76)\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(Z > 0.76) ≈ 1 - P(Z ≤ 0.76) ≈ 1 - 0.7764 ≈ 0.2236\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will exceed $60 in the next 3 months is approximately 22.36%."
