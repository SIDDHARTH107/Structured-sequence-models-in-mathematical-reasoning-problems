    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one fatal accident occurring, we can first find the probability of no fatal accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a non-fatal accident is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor 100 non-fatal accidents, the probability of no fatal accidents occurring is (0.95)^100 ≈ 0.00657.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one fatal accident occurring, we subtract the probability of no fatal accidents from 1:\n\n1 - 0.00657 ≈ 0.99343.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one fatal accident occurring on this road is approximately 0.99343 or 99.34%."
