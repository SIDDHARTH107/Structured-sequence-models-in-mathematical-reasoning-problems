    "message_1": "Alice and Bob want to securely communicate a secret message using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. They agree to use a modulus of 23 and a base of 5. Alice chooses a secret number of 3 and Bob chooses a secret number of 7. Using these values and the Diffie-Hellman protocol, what is the shared secret key they can use to encrypt and decrypt their messages?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman protocol, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key: (base ^ secret number) % modulus = (5 ^ 3) % 23 = 125 % 23 = 10\n2. Bob computes his public key: (base ^ secret number) % modulus = (5 ^ 7) % 23 = 78125 % 23 = 17\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key: (Bob's public key ^ her secret number) % modulus = (17 ^ 3) % 23 = 4913 % 23 = 18\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key: (Alice's public key ^ his secret number) % modulus = (10 ^ 7) % 23 = 10000000 % 23 = 18\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have computed the same shared secret key, which is 18. They can now use this key to encrypt and decrypt their messages."
