    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player A is given $100 and has the option to offer any amount of money to Player B. Player B can either accept the offer or reject it. If Player B accepts the offer, both players keep the designated amounts of money. If Player B rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. If Player A wants to maximize their own earnings while ensuring that Player B accepts the offer, what is the minimum amount of money they should offer to Player B?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, Player A should consider the minimum amount that Player B would be willing to accept. Since even a small amount of money is better than nothing, Player B is likely to accept any offer greater than $0. Therefore, to maximize their own earnings while ensuring that Player B accepts the offer, Player A should offer the minimum amount of $1 to Player B. This way, Player A would keep $99, and Player B would accept the offer since they would receive $1, which is better than nothing."
