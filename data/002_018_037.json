    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find the side length of the cube and the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the side length. We are given that the volume of the cube is 27 cubic units.\n\n27 = s^3\n\nTo find the side length, take the cube root of both sides:\n\ns = ∛27 = 3 units\n\nNow that we have the side length of the cube, we can find the diameter of the inscribed sphere. The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, which is 3 units. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 3/2 = 1.5 units\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula V = (4/3)πr^3:\n\nV = (4/3)π(1.5)^3\nV ≈ (4/3)π(3.375)\nV ≈ 4.5π\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 14.1 cubic units."
