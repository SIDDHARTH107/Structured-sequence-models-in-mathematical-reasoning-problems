    "message_2": "The function f(z) = z^2 + 1 is a polynomial function, which means it is entire (analytic on the whole complex plane). Therefore, the function is already analytic in the region Re(z) < 0, and there is no need to find an analytic continuation. The function f(z) = z^2 + 1 is its own analytic continuation in the region Re(z) < 0."
