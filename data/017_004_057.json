    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, we know that the prime factorization of the order of G is p^2, where p = 5. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, say H, of order 5. Since the index of H in G is 5, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 25 and |H| = 5, we have |G/H| = 5. Since 5 is a prime number, G/H is a cyclic group. Let gH be a generator of G/H, where g is an element of G. Then, the order of gH is 5, which implies that the order of g is either 5 or 25. If the order of g is 25, then G is a cyclic group generated by g, and we are done.\n\nNow, let's assume that the order of g is 5. Then, G is generated by H and g. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the set product of H and g, denoted by Hg. Note that |Hg| = |H||g| = 5 * 5 = 25, which implies that G = Hg. Moreover, since the orders of H and g are both 5, which is a prime number, H and g are both cyclic groups.\n\nFinally, we need to show that the intersection of H and g is trivial, i.e., H ∩ ⟨g⟩ = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Suppose there exists an element x in H ∩ ⟨g⟩, where x ≠ e. Then, x is an element of both H and ⟨g⟩, which implies that x has order 5 in both H and ⟨g⟩. However, this would mean that ⟨x⟩ is a subgroup of both H and ⟨g⟩, which contradicts the fact that H and ⟨g⟩ are distinct Sylow 5-subgroups of G. Therefore, H ∩ ⟨g⟩ = {e}.\n\nSince G = Hg and H ∩ ⟨g⟩ = {e}, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and ⟨g⟩, both of which are cyclic groups of order 5. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
