    "message_2": "To show that M is homeomorphic to R^3, we will construct a homeomorphism between M and R^3. Since M is a connected topological manifold of dimension 3, it is locally Euclidean. This means that for every point p in M, there exists an open neighborhood U of p and a homeomorphism h: U -> V, where V is an open subset of R^3.\n\nSince M is non-compact, it is not bounded. This means that there exists a sequence of points {p_n} in M such that the distance between p_n and p_m goes to infinity as n and m go to infinity. We can use this sequence to construct a straight line that goes to infinity in all directions.\n\nConsider the sequence of points {q_n} in R^3, where q_n = (n, 0, 0) for all n in the set of natural numbers. Define a map f: M -> R^3 as follows: for each point p in M, let f(p) = h(p) if p is in the domain of h, and f(p) = q_n if p = p_n for some n. This map is well-defined since the sequence {p_n} converges to infinity in M and the sequence {q_n} converges to infinity in R^3.\n\nWe claim that f is a homeomorphism between M and R^3. First, we show that f is continuous. Let p be a point in M and let V be an open neighborhood of f(p) in R^3. If p is in the domain of h, then h^(-1)(V) is an open neighborhood of p in M, and f(h^(-1)(V)) = V. If p = p_n for some n, then there exists an open neighborhood U of p in M such that U contains only finitely many points of the sequence {p_n}. Then f(U) is an open neighborhood of q_n in R^3, and f(U) contains V.\n\nNext, we show that f is a bijection. Since f is defined on all points of M and R^3, it is surjective. To show that f is injective, suppose that f(p) = f(q) for some points p and q in M. If p and q are both in the domain of h, then h(p) = h(q), so p = q. If p = p_n and q = p_m for some n and m, then q_n = q_m, so n = m and p = q. If p is in the domain of h and q = p_n for some n, then h(p) = q_n, which is a contradiction since h is a homeomorphism between U and V, and q_n is not in V.\n\nFinally, we show that the inverse map f^(-1): R^3 -> M is continuous. Let p be a point in M and let U be an open neighborhood of f^(-1)(p) in M. If p is in the range of h, then h(U) is an open neighborhood of p in R^3, and f^(-1)(h(U)) = U. If p = q_n for some n, then there exists an open neighborhood V of p in R^3 such that V contains only finitely many points of the sequence {q_n}. Then f^(-1)(V) is an open neighborhood of p_n in M, and f^(-1)(V) contains U.\n\nSince f is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse, it is a homeomorphism between M and R^3. Therefore, M is homeomorphic to R^3."
