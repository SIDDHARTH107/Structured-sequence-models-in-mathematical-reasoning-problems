    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the position function of the ball with respect to time. We are given the initial velocity (v0) and the acceleration due to gravity (a). \n\nThe acceleration function is a constant: a(t) = -9.8 m/s².\n\nTo find the velocity function, we integrate the acceleration function with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫(-9.8) dt = -9.8t + C1\n\nWe are given the initial velocity, v0 = 20 m/s. So, when t = 0, v(0) = 20:\n\n20 = -9.8(0) + C1\nC1 = 20\n\nSo, the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = -9.8t + 20\n\nNow, we integrate the velocity function to find the position function:\n\ns(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-9.8t + 20) dt = -4.9t² + 20t + C2\n\nWe are given that the initial height of the ball is 100 meters. So, when t = 0, s(0) = 100:\n\n100 = -4.9(0)² + 20(0) + C2\nC2 = 100\n\nSo, the position function is:\n\ns(t) = -4.9t² + 20t + 100\n\nTo find the maximum height, we need to find the critical points of the position function, which occur when the derivative (velocity function) is equal to zero:\n\n0 = -9.8t + 20\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = 20/9.8 ≈ 2.04 seconds\n\nNow, we plug this value of t back into the position function to find the maximum height:\n\ns(2.04) = -4.9(2.04)² + 20(2.04) + 100 ≈ 120.82 meters\n\nThe maximum height the ball will reach is approximately 120.82 meters.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the ball to return to the ground, we need to find when the position function is equal to zero:\n\n0 = -4.9t² + 20t + 100\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for t:\n\nt = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -4.9, b = 20, and c = 100:\n\nt = (-20 ± √(20² - 4(-4.9)(100))) / (2(-4.9))\n\nt ≈ -1.02, 4.12\n\nSince time cannot be negative, we take the positive value:\n\nt ≈ 4.12 seconds\n\nThe ball will take approximately 4.12 seconds to return to the ground."
