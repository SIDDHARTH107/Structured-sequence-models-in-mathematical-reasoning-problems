    "message_2": "When a line segment of length 1 is divided into 3 equal parts and the middle part is removed, the resulting line segment has a length of 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nIf this process is repeated indefinitely, we can find the total length of the Cantor set using the geometric series formula:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nIn this case, a (the first term) is 2/3, r (the common ratio) is 2/3, and n (the number of terms) approaches infinity.\n\nAs n approaches infinity, r^n approaches 0, so the formula becomes:\n\nSum = a / (1 - r)\n\nSum = (2/3) / (1 - 2/3)\n\nSum = (2/3) / (1/3)\n\nSum = 2\n\nSo, the total length of the Cantor set that is formed is 0. The Cantor set is an uncountable set of points, but its total length is 0 because it is a set of measure zero."
