    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 48 and 64, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (64) by the smaller number (48) and find the remainder.\n64 รท 48 = 1 with a remainder of 16.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (64) with the smaller number (48) and the smaller number with the remainder (16).\nNow we need to find the GCD of 48 and 16.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (48) by the smaller number (16) and find the remainder.\n48 รท 16 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 16. So, the GCD of 48 and 64 is 16."
