The payoff matrix for this game is as follows:\n\n| Player X / Player Y | Strategy A | Strategy B |\n|-------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Strategy A | (2,2) | (0,1) |\n| Strategy B | (1,0) | (3,3) |\n\nAssuming both players communicate with each other before making a move (cheap talk), what strategy should each player choose to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "If both players communicate and cooperate to maximize their joint payoff, they should choose Strategy B. This is because the payoff for both players choosing Strategy B is (3,3), which is higher than the payoff for both players choosing Strategy A (2,2). By choosing Strategy B, both players maximize their individual payoffs as well as their joint payoff."
