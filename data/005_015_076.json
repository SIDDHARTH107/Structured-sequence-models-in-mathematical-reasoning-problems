To analyze the data, the company wants to group the employees based on their salary and experience levels using cluster analysis. The data set contains 50 observations. The variables considered are salary (in thousands of dollars) and years of experience. The data set is as follows:\n\n| Employee | Salary | Experience (in years) |\n| -------- | ------ | --------------------- |\n| 1        | 35     | 4                     |\n| 2        | 42     | 6                     |\n| 3        | 27     | 2                     |\n| 4        | 39     | 7                     |\n| ...      | ...    | ...                   |\n| 50       | 32     | 5                     |\n\nUsing cluster analysis, divide the employees into 3 distinct groups based on their salary and years of experience. Show your work and how you arrived at your final solution.",
    "message_2": "To perform cluster analysis, we will use the k-means clustering algorithm. The k-means algorithm aims to partition the data into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. In this case, we want to divide the employees into 3 distinct groups (k=3).\n\nStep 1: Normalize the data\nBefore applying the k-means algorithm, it's important to normalize the data to ensure that both variables (salary and experience) have equal weight in the clustering process. We will use min-max normalization for this purpose.\n\nNormalized value = (Value - Min) / (Max - Min)\n\nFor salary:\nMin = 27, Max = 42\nNormalized salary = (Salary - 27) / (42 - 27)\n\nFor experience:\nMin = 2, Max = 7\nNormalized experience = (Experience - 2) / (7 - 2)\n\nStep 2: Initialize cluster centroids\nRandomly select 3 observations as the initial cluster centroids. Let's assume we have selected the following observations:\n\nCentroid 1: (35, 4)\nCentroid 2: (42, 6)\nCentroid 3: (27, 2)\n\nStep 3: Assign each observation to the nearest centroid\nCalculate the Euclidean distance between each observation and the centroids, and assign each observation to the nearest centroid.\n\nEuclidean distance = sqrt((Normalized salary difference)^2 + (Normalized experience difference)^2)\n\nStep 4: Update centroids\nCalculate the new centroids by taking the mean of the normalized salary and experience values of the observations in each cluster.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4\nContinue iterating between steps 3 and 4 until the centroids do not change significantly or a predefined number of iterations have been reached.\n\nStep 6: Denormalize the centroids\nOnce the algorithm converges, denormalize the centroids by reversing the normalization process.\n\nDenormalized salary = (Normalized salary * (42 - 27)) + 27\nDenormalized experience = (Normalized experience * (7 - 2)) + 2\n\nThe final solution will have 3 distinct groups of employees based on their salary and years of experience, with each group represented by its denormalized centroid.\n\nNote: Since the k-means algorithm is sensitive to the initial choice of centroids, it's a good idea to run the algorithm multiple times with different initial centroids and choose the solution with the lowest within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)."
