    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.05. If there are 100 companies randomly selected, what is the probability that exactly 5 companies will experience financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, financial frauds) in n trials (companies)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (financial fraud) in a single trial (company)\n- n is the number of trials (companies)\n- k is the number of successes (financial frauds)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 100 (companies)\n- k = 5 (financial frauds)\n- p = 0.05 (probability of financial fraud)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(100, 5):\n\nC(100, 5) = 100! / (5!(100-5)!) = 100! / (5!95!) ≈ 75,287,520\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(100, 5) * 0.05^5 * (1-0.05)^(100-5)\nP(X = 5) ≈ 75,287,520 * 0.05^5 * 0.95^95\nP(X = 5) ≈ 0.180\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 5 out of the 100 randomly selected companies will experience financial fraud is approximately 0.180 or 18%."
