    "message_2": "To find all possible subgroups of G, we need to consider the divisors of the order of G, which is 15. The divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. For each divisor, we will find the corresponding subgroup generated by a^k, where k is a factor of 15.\n\n1. For the divisor 1, we have the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n2. For the divisor 3, we have the subgroup generated by a^5 (since 15/3 = 5). This subgroup is {a^5, (a^5)^2, (a^5)^3} = {a^5, a^10, e}. This subgroup has order 3 and is cyclic.\n\n3. For the divisor 5, we have the subgroup generated by a^3 (since 15/5 = 3). This subgroup is {a^3, (a^3)^2, (a^3)^3, (a^3)^4, (a^3)^5} = {a^3, a^6, a^9, a^12, e}. This subgroup has order 5 and is cyclic.\n\n4. For the divisor 15, we have the entire group G itself, generated by a. This group is cyclic by definition.\n\nIn summary, we have the following subgroups of G:\n\n1. {e} (cyclic, order 1)\n2. {a^5, a^10, e} (cyclic, order 3)\n3. {a^3, a^6, a^9, a^12, e} (cyclic, order 5)\n4. G (cyclic, order 15)\n\nAll subgroups of G are cyclic."
