    "message_1": "Suppose there are 20 farmers who share a common field. Each farmer is free to use the field as much as he/she wants. The total profit each farmer can earn by using the field is directly proportional to their usage. The cost for each farmer to maintain the field is $200, and the revenue earned per unit usage per farmer is $50. The common field has a capacity of 400 units, beyond which its output will decline. What is the optimal usage for each farmer if they wish to maximize the total profit of the group?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units used by each farmer. Since there are 20 farmers, the total usage is 20x. The total profit for each farmer is the revenue earned minus the cost to maintain the field, which is $50x - $200. The total profit for the group is the sum of the profits of all 20 farmers, which is 20($50x - $200).\n\nWe want to maximize the total profit for the group, subject to the constraint that the total usage does not exceed the field's capacity of 400 units. In other words, we want to maximize 20($50x - $200) subject to the constraint 20x ≤ 400.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the profit function: 20($50x - $200) = $1000x - $4000.\n\nNow, let's consider the constraint: 20x ≤ 400. Dividing both sides by 20, we get x ≤ 20. Since the field's capacity is limited, the farmers should use the entire capacity to maximize their total profit. Therefore, each farmer should use 20 units of the field.\n\nSo, the optimal usage for each farmer is 20 units."
