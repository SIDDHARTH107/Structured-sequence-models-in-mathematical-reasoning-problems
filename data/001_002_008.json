    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 9), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation, which is given by:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is a point on the line and m is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope (m) using the two given points:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the points (3, 5) and (7, 9), we have:\n\nm = (9 - 5) / (7 - 3) = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either of the given points to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (3, 5):\n\ny - 5 = 1(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ny - 5 = x - 3\n\ny = x - 3 + 5\n\ny = x + 2\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 9) is:\n\ny = x + 2"
