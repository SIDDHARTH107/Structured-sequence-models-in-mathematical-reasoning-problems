    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of C1 and C2, we need to solve the system of equations formed by C1 and C2. Let's first rewrite C2 in terms of y^2:\n\nC2: y^2 = x^2 - 1\n\nNow substitute this expression for y^2 into C1:\n\nC1: 2x^2 + 3(x^2 - 1) - 5 = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n5x^2 - 3 - 5 = 0\n5x^2 - 8 = 0\n\nNow solve for x^2:\n\nx^2 = 8/5\n\nSince we are working over the complex field, x can have two values:\n\nx = ±√(8/5)\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding y values by substituting x back into the equation for y^2:\n\ny^2 = x^2 - 1\ny^2 = (8/5) - 1\ny^2 = 3/5\n\nAgain, since we are working over the complex field, y can have two values:\n\ny = ±√(3/5)\n\nSo, we have four intersection points over the complex field, taking into account their multiplicities:\n\n1. ( √(8/5),  √(3/5))\n2. ( √(8/5), -√(3/5))\n3. (-√(8/5),  √(3/5))\n4. (-√(8/5), -√(3/5))"
