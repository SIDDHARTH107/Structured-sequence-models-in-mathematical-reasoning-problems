    "message_2": "First, let's find the y-coordinates of the points where the line intersects the elliptic curve. We can do this by plugging the x-coordinates into the equation of the elliptic curve:\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = (1)^3 + 2(1) + 3\ny^2 = 1 + 2 + 3\ny^2 = 6\ny = ±√6\n\nSo, the points are (1, √6) and (1, -√6).\n\nFor x = 4:\ny^2 = (4)^3 + 2(4) + 3\ny^2 = 64 + 8 + 3\ny^2 = 75\ny = ±√75\n\nSo, the points are (4, √75) and (4, -√75).\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the line that passes through these points. The general equation of a line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nWe can find the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nLet's first find the line passing through (1, √6) and (4, √75):\n\nm = (√75 - √6) / (4 - 1)\nm = (√75 - √6) / 3\n\nNow, we can find the y-intercept (b) by plugging one of the points into the equation and solving for b:\n\n√6 = m(1) + b\nb = √6 - m\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through (1, √6) and (4, √75) is:\n\ny = ((√75 - √6) / 3)x + (√6 - (√75 - √6) / 3)\n\nNow, let's find the line passing through (1, -√6) and (4, -√75):\n\nm = (-√75 + √6) / (4 - 1)\nm = (-√75 + √6) / 3\n\nNow, we can find the y-intercept (b) by plugging one of the points into the equation and solving for b:\n\n-√6 = m(1) + b\nb = -√6 - m\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through (1, -√6) and (4, -√75) is:\n\ny = ((-√75 + √6) / 3)x + (-√6 - (-√75 + √6) / 3)\n\nThus, we have found the equations of the two lines that intersect the elliptic curve at the given points."
