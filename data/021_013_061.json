    "message_2": "Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. The algorithm starts with an initial solution and iteratively moves to a neighboring solution with a probability that depends on the difference in the objective function values and a temperature parameter. The temperature parameter decreases over time, making the algorithm more likely to accept better solutions and less likely to accept worse solutions.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7 using simulated annealing, follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7\n2. Choose an initial solution x0 (e.g., a random number within the search space)\n3. Set an initial temperature T0 and a cooling rate alpha (e.g., T0 = 1000 and alpha = 0.99)\n4. Set the maximum number of iterations max_iter (e.g., 1000)\n\nFor each iteration i from 1 to max_iter:\n  a. Generate a neighboring solution x_new by perturbing the current solution x (e.g., x_new = x + random.uniform(-1, 1))\n  b. Calculate the change in the objective function value: delta_f = f(x_new) - f(x)\n  c. If delta_f < 0 (i.e., the new solution is better), accept the new solution: x = x_new\n  d. If delta_f >= 0 (i.e., the new solution is worse), accept the new solution with probability exp(-delta_f / T): if random.random() < exp(-delta_f / T), x = x_new\n  e. Update the temperature: T = alpha * T\n\nAfter the iterations are complete, the final solution x should be close to the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7. Note that the algorithm may not always find the exact minimum, but it should provide a good approximation.\n\nIn this case, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7 can be found analytically by completing the square or taking the derivative and setting it to zero. The minimum occurs at x = 2, and the minimum value is f(2) = 2^2 - 4*2 + 7 = 4 - 8 + 7 = 3."
