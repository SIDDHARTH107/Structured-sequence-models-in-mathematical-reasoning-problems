    "message_2": "To find the mean, median, and mode of this dataset, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Mean: Add up all the values and divide by the total number of values.\n2. Median: Arrange the values in ascending order and find the middle value.\n3. Mode: Find the value(s) that occur most frequently in the dataset.\n\nMean:\n(10 + 15 + 18 + 20 + 22 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45) / 10 = 270 / 10 = 27\n\nMedian:\nThe dataset is already in ascending order. Since there are 10 values (an even number), we will take the average of the two middle values (20 and 22).\n(20 + 22) / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21\n\nMode:\nThere are no repeating values in this dataset, so there is no mode.\n\nSo, the mean is 27, the median is 21, and there is no mode for this dataset."
