    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, player 1 is given $100 and has to propose a split of the money to player 2. If player 2 accepts the split, both players get the agreed upon amounts. If player 2 rejects the split, both players get nothing. Assuming player 2 is rational and values money equally, what is the smallest amount player 1 should offer to player 2 to ensure a fair split is accepted?",
    "message_2": "In an ultimatum game, if player 2 is rational and values money equally, they would accept any amount greater than $0, as receiving something is better than receiving nothing. Therefore, the smallest amount player 1 should offer to player 2 to ensure the split is accepted is $1. This would result in player 1 receiving $99 and player 2 receiving $1."
