    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find (A△B)△{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)} where △ represents the symmetric difference of two sets and {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)} represents the Cartesian product of the two sets.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A△B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. \n\nA△B = {1, 4} (since 1 is in A but not in B, and 4 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetric difference of (A△B) and the given set {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)}. However, there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The symmetric difference operation is defined for sets of the same type, i.e., sets containing the same kind of elements. In this case, A△B is a set of single numbers, while {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)} is a set of ordered pairs (tuples). Therefore, it is not possible to find the symmetric difference of these two sets, as they are not of the same type."
