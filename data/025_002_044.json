    "message_2": "First, we need to find the tangent line to the curve $C$ at the point $P=(1,1)$. To do this, we will differentiate the equation of the curve implicitly with respect to $x$ and then find the slope of the tangent line at $P$.\n\nDifferentiating the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x - 2$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 2$\n\nNow, we will plug in the coordinates of the point $P=(1,1)$ into the equation to find the slope of the tangent line at $P$:\n\n$2(1)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(1)^2 + 2$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{5}{2}$\n\nNow, we have the slope of the tangent line at $P$. The equation of the tangent line is given by:\n\n$y - 1 = \\frac{5}{2}(x - 1)$\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nNow, we will find the intersection points of the curve $C$ and the tangent line. To do this, we will substitute the expression for $y$ from the tangent line equation into the curve equation:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{5}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = x^3 + 2x - 2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{25}{4}x^2 - \\frac{15}{2}x + \\frac{9}{4} = x^3 + 2x - 2$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$x^3 - \\frac{25}{4}x^2 + \\frac{23}{2}x - \\frac{17}{4} = 0$\n\nSince we know that $P=(1,1)$ is a point on the curve and the tangent line, it must be a solution to the equation above. Therefore, we can factor out $(x-1)$:\n\n$(x-1)(x^2 - 6x + 4) = 0$\n\nNow, we have two intersection points: $P=(1,1)$ and the other point(s) given by the quadratic equation $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$. Since the tangent line intersects the curve at $P$ with multiplicity 2, the intersection number $C \\cdot C$ at $P$ is 2.\n\nTo find the intersection number $C \\cdot C \\cdot C$ at $P$, we need to consider the intersection of the curve $C$ with itself three times. However, since the intersection number $C \\cdot C$ at $P$ is already 2, the intersection number $C \\cdot C \\cdot C$ at $P$ must be at least 2. Since the intersection number cannot be greater than the multiplicity of the point on the curve, the intersection number $C \\cdot C \\cdot C$ at $P$ is also 2."
