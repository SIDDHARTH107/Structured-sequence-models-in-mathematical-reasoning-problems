    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (which is a circle) and the area of the lateral surface (which is a sector of a larger circle). Then, we add these two areas together.\n\n1. Base area (A_base): \nThe base is a circle with a radius of 4 cm. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. \n\nA_base = π(4 cm)^2\nA_base = π(16 cm^2)\nA_base = 16π cm^2\n\n2. Lateral surface area (A_lateral): \nThe lateral surface of a cone can be \"unrolled\" into a sector of a larger circle. The radius of this larger circle is the slant height of the cone (10 cm), and the arc length of the sector is the circumference of the base of the cone (2πr, where r is the radius of the base). \n\nThe formula for the area of a sector is A = (1/2) * r * s, where A is the area, r is the radius, and s is the arc length. \n\nA_lateral = (1/2) * (10 cm) * (2π(4 cm))\nA_lateral = (1/2) * (10 cm) * (8π cm)\nA_lateral = 40π cm^2\n\n3. Total surface area (A_total): \nAdd the base area and the lateral surface area together.\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 16π cm^2 + 40π cm^2\nA_total = 56π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the right circular cone is 56π cm^2."
