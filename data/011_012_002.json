    "message_1": "In a school with 150 students, there are 80 students who take Math, 60 students who take Science, and 30 students who take both Math and Science. How many students are not taking Math or Science?",
    "message_2": "We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nTotal number of students taking Math or Science = number of students taking Math + number of students taking Science - number of students taking both Math and Science.\n\nTotal number of students taking Math or Science = 80 (Math) + 60 (Science) - 30 (both)\n\nTotal number of students taking Math or Science = 110\n\nNow, we need to find the number of students who are not taking Math or Science.\n\nTotal number of students - Total number of students taking Math or Science = number of students not taking Math or Science\n\n150 (total students) - 110 (taking Math or Science) = 40\n\nSo, there are 40 students who are not taking Math or Science."
