    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 9 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 5x^3, n = 3. So, the derivative is (3 * 5) * x^(3-1) = 15x^2.\n2. For the term 2x^2, n = 2. So, the derivative is (2 * 2) * x^(2-1) = 4x.\n3. For the term -7x, n = 1. So, the derivative is (1 * -7) * x^(1-1) = -7.\n4. For the constant term 9, the derivative is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^2 + 4x - 7"
