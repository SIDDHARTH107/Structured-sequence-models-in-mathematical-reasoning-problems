    "message_1": "In type theory, we have a type called \"Boolean\" which has two values: \"True\" and \"False\". Suppose we have a function \"not\" that takes a Boolean value and returns its negation (i.e., \"True\" becomes \"False\" and vice versa). \n\nIf we apply this function twice to a Boolean value, would we get the original value back? \n\nWrite a truth table to show the results of applying the \"not\" function two times to both \"True\" and \"False\".",
    "message_2": "Yes, applying the \"not\" function twice to a Boolean value would give us the original value back. Let's create a truth table to demonstrate this:\n\n| Input | not(Input) | not(not(Input)) |\n|-------|------------|-----------------|\n| True  | False      | True            |\n| False | True       | False           |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, applying the \"not\" function twice to both \"True\" and \"False\" returns the original values. This is because the \"not\" function negates the input value, and negating it again brings it back to the original value."
