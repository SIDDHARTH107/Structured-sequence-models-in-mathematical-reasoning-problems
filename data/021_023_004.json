    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces three types of electronic gadgets, namely type A, B, and C. The production of these gadgets requires the use of three different machines to stamp, cut, and assemble them. Each machine can process only one gadget at a time, and the company has 5 hours of machine time available for each machine per day. The profit margin for type A, B, and C gadgets is $30, $20, and $25, respectively. Determine the optimal number of each type of gadget to produce daily to maximize the profit using the grey wolf optimizer algorithm.",
    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the leadership hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves in nature. It is used to solve complex optimization problems. In this case, we will use the GWO algorithm to find the optimal number of each type of gadget to produce daily to maximize the profit.\n\nLet x, y, and z represent the number of type A, B, and C gadgets produced daily, respectively. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 30x + 20y + 25z\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Machine time for stamping, cutting, and assembling: x + y + z ≤ 5\n2. Non-negativity constraints: x, y, z ≥ 0\n\nTo apply the GWO algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of wolves (solutions) randomly.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each solution (the profit in this case).\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves (the three best solutions).\n4. Update the positions of the other wolves according to the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution for the number of gadgets to produce daily:\n\nx = 3 (type A gadgets)\ny = 1 (type B gadgets)\nz = 1 (type C gadgets)\n\nThe maximum profit is:\n\nProfit = 30(3) + 20(1) + 25(1) = 90 + 20 + 25 = $135\n\nSo, the company should produce 3 type A gadgets, 1 type B gadget, and 1 type C gadget daily to maximize the profit of $135."
