    "message_1": "A sample of Uranium-238 has an initial mass of 400 grams. If the half-life of Uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years, how much of the mass will remain after 13.5 billion years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 400 grams, the time elapsed is 13.5 billion years, and the half-life of Uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 400 * (1/2)^(13.5 / 4.5)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of half-lives that have passed:\n\n13.5 billion years / 4.5 billion years = 3 half-lives\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nFinal mass = 400 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 400 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 50 grams\n\nSo, after 13.5 billion years, 50 grams of the initial 400 grams of Uranium-238 will remain."
