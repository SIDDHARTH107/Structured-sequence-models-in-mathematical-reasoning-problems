    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and frequency of the wave components, we need to identify the individual wave components in the given function. The function h(x,t) is already given as a sum of two sinusoidal functions:\n\nh(x,t) = 0.5sin(4π(x-3t)) + 0.3cos(8π(x+t))\n\nNow, let's analyze each component separately:\n\n1) 0.5sin(4π(x-3t))\nThis is a sine wave with amplitude A1 = 0.5 and angular frequency ω1 = 4π. The wave number k1 can be found by comparing the argument of the sine function with kx - ωt, which gives k1 = 4π. The frequency f1 can be found by dividing the angular frequency by 2π: f1 = ω1 / (2π) = 4π / (2π) = 2 Hz.\n\n2) 0.3cos(8π(x+t))\nThis is a cosine wave with amplitude A2 = 0.3 and angular frequency ω2 = 8π. The wave number k2 can be found by comparing the argument of the cosine function with kx - ωt, which gives k2 = 8π. The frequency f2 can be found by dividing the angular frequency by 2π: f2 = ω2 / (2π) = 8π / (2π) = 4 Hz.\n\nSo, the wave components are:\n\n1) Amplitude A1 = 0.5, frequency f1 = 2 Hz\n2) Amplitude A2 = 0.3, frequency f2 = 4 Hz"
