    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at point P(2, -1, 2), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe surface equation is: F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3x - 3y - 3z + 5\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x - 3\n∂F/∂y = 2y - 3\n∂F/∂z = 2z - 3\n\nNext, we evaluate the partial derivatives at the point P(2, -1, 2):\n\n∂F/∂x(P) = 2(2) - 3 = 1\n∂F/∂y(P) = 2(-1) - 3 = -5\n∂F/∂z(P) = 2(2) - 3 = 1\n\nThe gradient at point P is given by the vector (1, -5, 1). This vector is also the normal vector to the tangent plane at point P. Now we can use the point-normal form of the plane equation:\n\nA(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector (1, -5, 1) and (x0, y0, z0) is the point P(2, -1, 2):\n\n1(x - 2) - 5(y + 1) + 1(z - 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx - 5y + z - 1 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at point P(2, -1, 2) is:\n\nx - 5y + z - 1 = 0"
