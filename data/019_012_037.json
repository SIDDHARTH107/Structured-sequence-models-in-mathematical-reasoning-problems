    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but paraconsistent logic doesn't involve numerical problems. It is a type of logic that allows for contradictions without leading to a complete breakdown of reasoning, which is not based on numerical values or equations. Instead, it deals with propositions and their truth values. If you'd like, I can provide a question that involves concepts of paraconsistent logic for a math student to solve, but it won't be a precise numerical problem.",
    "message_2": "Sure, here's a question related to paraconsistent logic:\n\nConsider the following propositions:\n\nA: \"This statement is true.\"\nB: \"Statement A is false.\"\n\nUsing paraconsistent logic, determine the truth values of statements A and B. Are they true, false, both, or neither?"
