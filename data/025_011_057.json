    "message_1": "Let A be an abelian variety of dimension 3 over a field K. Suppose that A(K) is finite and that A has good reduction at every prime of K. If |A(K)|=61, find a prime number p of K such that A has non-reduced reduction at p.",
    "message_2": "Since A(K) is finite with 61 elements and A has good reduction at every prime of K, we have a contradiction in the problem statement. It is not possible to find a prime number p of K such that A has non-reduced reduction at p, as it is given that A has good reduction at every prime of K."
