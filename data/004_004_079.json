    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x over the given interval.\n\nThe integral of f(x) = x^2 with respect to x is:\n\nâˆ«(x^2) dx = (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we need to find the definite integral from x = 0 to x = 4:\n\nArea = [(1/3)(4)^3 + C] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + C]\n\nArea = [(1/3)(64) + 0] - [(1/3)(0) + 0]\n\nArea = (64/3)\n\nTherefore, the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 64/3 square units."
