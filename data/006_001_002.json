    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 tosses, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (tosses)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial (toss)\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial (toss)\n- n is the number of trials (tosses)\n- k is the number of successes (heads)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 10 (tosses)\n- k = 6 (heads)\n- p = 1/2 (since it's a fair coin)\n- q = 1/2 (since it's a fair coin)\n\nFirst, let's find nCk (10C6):\n\n10C6 = 10! / (6! * (10-6)!)\n10C6 = 10! / (6! * 4!)\n10C6 = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n10C6 = 210\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = (210) * (1/2)^6 * (1/2)^(10-6)\nP(X = 6) = 210 * (1/64) * (1/16)\nP(X = 6) = 210 * (1/1024)\nP(X = 6) â‰ˆ 0.2051\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 tosses of a fair coin is approximately 0.2051 or 20.51%."
