    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exist subgroups of G with orders 5 and 7, which we will denote as H and K, respectively. Let's denote the orders of these subgroups as |H| = 5 and |K| = 7.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups (n_5) divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups (n_7) divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1. Thus, there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup H and a unique 7-Sylow subgroup K.\n\nSince H and K are the unique subgroups of their respective orders, they must be normal in G. Now, consider the elements h ∈ H and k ∈ K. Since |H| and |K| are coprime (gcd(5, 7) = 1), we have that the order of hk is the least common multiple of the orders of h and k, which is 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nNow, consider the set HK = {hk : h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. Since |H| = 5 and |K| = 7, we have |HK| = 35. Since the order of hk is 35, we have that HK is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since |HK| = |G|, we have that HK = G.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. G is cyclic: In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 35, which is Z_35.\n\n2. G is not cyclic: In this case, we have shown that G is the internal direct product of H and K, which are both cyclic (since they have prime order). Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups with orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 35, it must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups with orders 5 and 7, respectively."
