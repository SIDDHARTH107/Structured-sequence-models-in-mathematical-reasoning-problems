    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these Cartesian products:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\n(B x A) ∪ (A x B) = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nAs we can see, both (A x B) ∪ (B x A) and (B x A) ∪ (A x B) result in the same set of ordered pairs. Therefore, the two sets are equal, and the Cartesian product of two sets is commutative with respect to union in this case.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this example does not prove that the Cartesian product is always commutative with respect to union for all sets. This example only demonstrates that it is true for these specific sets A and B."
