    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the sine formula for the area of a triangle: \n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we don't have the angle between the base and the height. Instead, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then use the cosine formula to find the angle.\n\nLet's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c. \n\na = 8 meters\nb = 10 meters\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n8^2 + 10^2 = c^2\n64 + 100 = c^2\n164 = c^2\nc = √164 ≈ 12.81 meters\n\nNow we can use the cosine formula to find the angle between the base and the height. Let's call this angle θ.\n\ncos(θ) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2 * a * b)\ncos(θ) = (8^2 + 10^2 - (12.81)^2) / (2 * 8 * 10)\ncos(θ) = (64 + 100 - 164) / 160\ncos(θ) = 0\n\nθ = arccos(0)\nθ = 90°\n\nSince the angle between the base and the height is 90°, this is a right-angled triangle. Therefore, we can simply use the formula for the area of a right-angled triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 10\nArea = 4 * 10\nArea = 40 square meters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 40 square meters."
