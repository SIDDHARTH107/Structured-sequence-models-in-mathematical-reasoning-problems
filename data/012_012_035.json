    "message_2": "The girth of a graph G is the length of the shortest cycle in G. To determine the girth of G, we will use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * |E| / (|V| - k + 1)\n\nwhere |E| is the number of edges, |V| is the number of vertices, and k is the number of connected components in G. Since G is connected, k = 1.\n\nIn this case, |E| = 14 and |V| = 10, so the inequality becomes:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 14 / (10 - 1 + 1) = 28 / 10 = 2.8\n\nSince the girth must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer, which is 3. Therefore, the girth of G is at least 3.\n\nNow, let's check if it's possible to have a girth of 3. A graph with girth 3 has at least one triangle (a cycle of length 3). In the worst-case scenario, we can add triangles one by one, each time adding a new vertex and two new edges. \n\n1st triangle: 3 vertices, 3 edges\n2nd triangle: 4 vertices, 5 edges\n3rd triangle: 5 vertices, 7 edges\n4th triangle: 6 vertices, 9 edges\n5th triangle: 7 vertices, 11 edges\n6th triangle: 8 vertices, 13 edges\n7th triangle: 9 vertices, 15 edges\n\nWe can see that with 10 vertices, we can have at most 6 triangles, which results in 13 edges. However, our graph has 14 edges, so it must have a cycle of length greater than 3.\n\nThus, the girth of G is 4."
