Choose an integer e such that 1<e<φ(n) and e is co-prime to φ(n).\nWe can choose e = 13, as it is between 1 and 60 and is co-prime to 60 (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\n4. Compute an integer d such that d is the inverse of e modulo φ(n).\nWe need to find a value for d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1.\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we can find d = 37, as (13 * 37) % 60 = 481 % 60 = 1.\n\n5. The public key is (n,e), and the private key is (n,d).\nPublic key: (77, 13)\nPrivate key: (77, 37)"
