    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 4 elements. Calculate the size of the power set of A and show that it is greater than the size of A itself.",
    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself. The size of the power set of A is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in A.\n\nIn this case, A has 4 elements, so the size of the power set of A is 2^4 = 16.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set of A to the size of A itself. The size of A is 4, and the size of the power set of A is 16. Since 16 > 4, the size of the power set of A is greater than the size of A itself."
