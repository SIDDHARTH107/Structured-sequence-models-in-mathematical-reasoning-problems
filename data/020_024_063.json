    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem related to optimal pricing:\n\nA company produces and sells widgets at a cost of $10 per unit. The demand function for these widgets can be expressed as q = 100 - 2p, where q is the quantity demanded at a price of p. Determine the price that will maximize the company's profit.\n\nGood luck with the problem-solving!",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to find the price that maximizes the profit function. The profit function can be expressed as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue is the product of the price and the quantity demanded (p * q), and the cost is the product of the cost per unit and the quantity demanded ($10 * q).\n\nFirst, let's express the revenue in terms of p:\n\nRevenue = p * q = p * (100 - 2p)\n\nNow, let's express the cost in terms of p:\n\nCost = $10 * q = $10 * (100 - 2p)\n\nNow we can write the profit function in terms of p:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = p * (100 - 2p) - $10 * (100 - 2p)\n\nTo find the price that maximizes the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative with respect to p and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dp = (100 - 2p) - 2p - 20 + 20p = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n-4p + 20p = 100 - 20\n16p = 80\n\nNow, solve for p:\n\np = 80 / 16\np = $5\n\nSo, the price that will maximize the company's profit is $5 per widget."
