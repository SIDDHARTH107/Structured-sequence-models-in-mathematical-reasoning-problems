    "message_1": "A rectangular garden measuring 10 meters by 20 meters is to be surrounded by a fence. What is the minimum length of fence required if the fence will be placed around the perimeter of the garden?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum length of fence required, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 20 meters and the width is 10 meters. So, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (20 + 10)\nPerimeter = 2 * 30\nPerimeter = 60 meters\n\nTherefore, the minimum length of fence required to surround the garden is 60 meters."
