    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants (7, 14, 21).\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2  4 -2 |\n    | 3  6 -3 |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | 14  |\n    | 21  |\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = 1 * (4 * (-3) - (-2) * 6) - 2 * (2 * (-3) - (-2) * 3) + (-1) * (2 * 6 - 4 * 3)\n\ndet(A) = 1 * ( -12 + 12) - 2 * (-6 + 6) + (-1) * (12 - 12)\n\ndet(A) = 0\n\nSince the determinant of matrix A is 0, the matrix is singular. A singular matrix means that it is not invertible, and in the context of a system of linear equations, it indicates that the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the system of equations to determine if it has no solution or infinitely many solutions. We can do this by checking if the equations are consistent.\n\nNotice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. In other words, all three equations are linearly dependent and represent the same line in 3D space.\n\nSince all three equations represent the same line, there are infinitely many points (x, y, z) that satisfy the system of equations. Therefore, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions."
