The intersection of two sets contains all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA intersect B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of A and B, we find that the common elements are 2 and 4.\n\nSo, A intersect B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that A intersect B is a subset of A and a subset of B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if every element of set X is also an element of set Y, then X is a subset of Y, denoted as X ⊆ Y.\n\n1. A intersect B ⊆ A:\n\nFor every element x in A intersect B, x must also be in A. Since A intersect B = {2, 4}, and both 2 and 4 are elements of A, A intersect B is a subset of A.\n\n2. A intersect B ⊆ B:\n\nSimilarly, for every element x in A intersect B, x must also be in B. Since A intersect B = {2, 4}, and both 2 and 4 are elements of B, A intersect B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that A intersect B is a subset of both A and B."
