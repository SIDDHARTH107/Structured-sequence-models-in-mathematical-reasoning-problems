Next, find the symmetric difference of B and A and then find the intersection of the symmetric difference with A. Show that the two results are not equal, proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In this case, the symmetric difference of A and B is:\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference with B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A:\n\nB ∆ A = {4, 1}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference with A:\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ A = {4, 1} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1}\n\nAs we can see, the two results are not equal:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {4} ≠ {1} = (B ∆ A) ∩ A\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
