    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G, denoted by λ(G), is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges that, when removed, will result in at least one vertex being disconnected from the rest of the graph.\n\nMenger's theorem states that the edge connectivity of a graph G is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in the graph. To find the edge connectivity of the given graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Find the minimum degree of the graph, denoted by δ(G). This is the smallest number of edges connected to any vertex in the graph.\n\n2. Since the edge connectivity λ(G) cannot be greater than the minimum degree δ(G), we can use this as an upper bound for the edge connectivity.\n\n3. Check if there is a pair of vertices with edge-disjoint paths less than or equal to the minimum degree. If such a pair exists, the edge connectivity will be equal to the number of edge-disjoint paths between that pair of vertices.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph G:\n\n1. To find the minimum degree δ(G), we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our case, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 12 = 24. Since there are 8 vertices, the average degree of a vertex is 24 / 8 = 3. Therefore, the minimum degree δ(G) must be less than or equal to 3.\n\n2. The edge connectivity λ(G) cannot be greater than the minimum degree δ(G), so λ(G) ≤ 3.\n\n3. Now, we need to check if there is a pair of vertices with edge-disjoint paths less than or equal to the minimum degree. Since the minimum degree is 3, we can look for a pair of vertices with 3 or fewer edge-disjoint paths between them. If such a pair exists, the edge connectivity will be equal to the number of edge-disjoint paths between that pair of vertices.\n\nWithout the specific details of the graph, we cannot determine the exact edge connectivity. However, we can conclude that the edge connectivity of the given graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges is at most 3, i.e., λ(G) ≤ 3."
