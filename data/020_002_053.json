    "message_1": "A farm has 200 acres of land to grow two crops: strawberries and tomatoes. Each acre of strawberries requires 30 hours of labor, while each acre of tomatoes requires 20 hours of labor. The labor available for the farm is limited to 4000 hours. Strawberries sell for $1000 per acre, while tomatoes sell for $1500 per acre. How many acres of each crop should the farm plant to maximize their revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of strawberries and y be the number of acres of tomatoes. We are given the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (total acres)\n2. 30x + 20y ≤ 4000 (total labor hours)\n\nWe want to maximize the revenue, which is given by the equation:\n\nRevenue = 1000x + 1500y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint equations for y:\n\ny ≤ 200 - x (from constraint 1)\ny ≤ (4000 - 30x) / 20 (from constraint 2)\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the intersection points of the constraint equations:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2:\nx + y = 200\n30x + 20y = 4000\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. We'll use substitution:\n\ny = 200 - x\n30x + 20(200 - x) = 4000\n\n30x + 4000 - 20x = 4000\n10x = 0\nx = 0\n\ny = 200 - 0 = 200\n\nSo, one vertex is (0, 200).\n\nNext, we'll find the intersection of each constraint equation with the x and y axes:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 with x-axis (y = 0):\nx + 0 = 200\nx = 200\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 with y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + y = 200\ny = 200\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 with x-axis (y = 0):\n30x + 20(0) = 4000\n30x = 4000\nx = 4000 / 30 ≈ 133.33\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 with y-axis (x = 0):\n30(0) + 20y = 4000\n20y = 4000\ny = 4000 / 20 = 200\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 200), (200, 0), and (133.33, 200).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the revenue function at each vertex:\n\nRevenue at (0, 200) = 1000(0) + 1500(200) = $300,000\nRevenue at (200, 0) = 1000(200) + 1500(0) = $200,000\nRevenue at (133.33, 200) = 1000(133.33) + 1500(200) = $433,330\n\nThe maximum revenue is $433,330, which occurs when the farm plants approximately 133.33 acres of strawberries and 200 acres of tomatoes. Since the farm cannot plant a fraction of an acre, they should plant 133 acres of strawberries and 200 acres of tomatoes to maximize their revenue."
