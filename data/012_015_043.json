    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 8 vertices, so a connected graph must have at least 8-1 = 7 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 10 edges, which is more than the minimum required 7 edges, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, just because a graph has more than the minimum required number of edges does not guarantee that it is connected.\n\nTo be sure, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges in the graph. Without that information, we cannot definitively determine if the graph is connected or not."
