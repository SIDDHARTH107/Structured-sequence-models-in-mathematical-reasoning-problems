    "message_2": "A level-1 dragon curve has 2 line segments. With each iteration, the number of line segments doubles. To find the number of line segments in a level-5 dragon curve, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^(level - 1)\n\nFor a level-5 dragon curve:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^(5 - 1) = 2^4 = 16\n\nSo, a level-5 dragon curve requires 16 line segments."
