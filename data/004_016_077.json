    "message_1": "Suppose a race car travels around an oval track of length 1 mile in 120 seconds. Use Mean Value Theorem to prove that at some point, the car must have traveled at exactly 30 mph.",
    "message_2": "Let f(t) represent the position of the race car on the track at time t, where t is measured in seconds. Since the car completes the 1-mile track in 120 seconds, we have f(0) = f(120) (assuming the car starts and ends at the same position).\n\nNow, we want to show that at some point, the car must have traveled at exactly 30 mph. First, we need to convert 30 mph to feet per second, since our time unit is in seconds and we need to be consistent with our units. There are 5280 feet in a mile, and 3600 seconds in an hour, so:\n\n30 mph * (5280 feet/mile) * (1 hour/3600 seconds) = 44 feet/second\n\nNow we want to show that there exists a time t in the interval [0, 120] such that the car's instantaneous speed is 44 feet/second.\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, if f(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 120] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 120), then there exists a number c in the open interval (0, 120) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(120) - f(0)) / (120 - 0)\n\nSince the car travels 1 mile (5280 feet) in 120 seconds, we have:\n\nf'(c) = (5280 - 0) / (120 - 0) = 5280 / 120 = 44\n\nSo, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a time c in the interval (0, 120) such that the car's instantaneous speed is 44 feet/second, which is equivalent to 30 mph. Therefore, at some point, the car must have traveled at exactly 30 mph."
