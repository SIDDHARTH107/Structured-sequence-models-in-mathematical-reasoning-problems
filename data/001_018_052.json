    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. \n\n1. Subtracting logarithms with the same base is equivalent to dividing the arguments:\n\nlog base 2 (8x) - log base 2 (2) = log base 2 (8x / 2)\n\n2. Simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n\nlog base 2 (4x) = 2\n\n3. To solve for x, we can rewrite the logarithmic equation as an exponential equation:\n\n2^(log base 2 (4x)) = 2^2\n\n4. Since the base of the logarithm and the base of the exponent are the same, we can remove them:\n\n4x = 4\n\n5. Finally, solve for x:\n\nx = 4 / 4\nx = 1"
