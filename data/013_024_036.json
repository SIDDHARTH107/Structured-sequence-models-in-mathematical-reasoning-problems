    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem based on the Volunteer's Dilemma in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose there are six volunteers who have offered to help clean up a park. If at least four volunteers show up, the park will be thoroughly cleaned, which is the best outcome for everyone involved. However, if fewer than four volunteers show up, the park will not be fully cleaned, and the volunteers who did show up will have been wasted their time and effort. Each volunteer must decide whether to show up or not, not knowing whether the others will show up or not.\n\nIf each volunteer prefers the park to be fully cleaned and they trust each other, how many volunteers should show up to ensure the park is thoroughly cleaned?",
    "message_2": "To ensure the park is thoroughly cleaned, at least four volunteers should show up. However, since they trust each other, all six volunteers can show up to guarantee the best outcome for everyone involved."
