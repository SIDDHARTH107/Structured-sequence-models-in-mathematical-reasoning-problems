    "message_1": "Let's say that in a given region, the probability of a tornado occurring in a year is 0.02. What is the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the region in the next four years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability of no tornadoes occurring in the next four years and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least one tornado occurring.\n\nThe probability of no tornado occurring in a year is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nThe probability of no tornadoes occurring in the next four years is the product of the probabilities of no tornado occurring in each of those years:\n\n0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.92236816\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next four years:\n\n1 - 0.92236816 = 0.07763184\n\nSo, the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the region in the next four years is approximately 0.0776 or 7.76%."
