    "message_2": "The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_n+1 = 1 - a * x_n^2 + y_n\ny_n+1 = b * x_n\n\nwhere x_n and y_n are the coordinates at the nth iteration, and a and b are the parameters of the map.\n\nFor the Hénon map to exhibit chaotic behavior, the parameters a and b must lie within certain ranges. The most commonly studied chaotic behavior occurs when b is set to 0.3. In this case, the minimum value of the parameter \"a\" for which the Hénon map exhibits chaotic behavior is approximately a = 1.4."
