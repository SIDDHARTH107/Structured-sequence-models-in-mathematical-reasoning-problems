    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. The first few Sophie Germain primes are 2, 3, 5, 11, and 23. To find the sixth Sophie Germain prime, we can continue testing prime numbers.\n\nThe next prime number after 23 is 29. Let's check if 2(29) + 1 is prime:\n\n2(29) + 1 = 58 + 1 = 59\n\n59 is a prime number. Therefore, the sixth Sophie Germain prime number is 29."
