    "message_1": "A factory produces 1000 units of a certain product every day. The probability of a defective unit being produced is 0.02. What is the probability of having at least 20 defective units in a day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of having at least 20 defective units in a day, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of units produced (1000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective units (20 or more in this case)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (0.02 in this case)\n\nSince we want the probability of having at least 20 defective units, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 1000.\n\nP(X >= 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 20 to 1000\n\nHowever, calculating this sum directly can be quite tedious. Instead, we can find the probability of having fewer than 20 defective units and subtract it from 1 to get the probability of having at least 20 defective units.\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of the probabilities for k = 0 to 19 using the binomial probability formula and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - Σ [C(1000, k) * (0.02)^k * (0.98)^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nUsing a calculator or software that can handle binomial probabilities, we find that:\n\nP(X >= 20) ≈ 0.959\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 20 defective units in a day is approximately 0.959 or 95.9%."
