    "message_2": "A biholomorphism is a bijective holomorphic function with a holomorphic inverse. In other words, we are looking for a function f: D → G that is holomorphic (complex differentiable) and has a holomorphic inverse. One such function is the Möbius transformation, which is defined as follows:\n\nf(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex numbers such that ad - bc ≠ 0. We want to find a Möbius transformation that maps the open unit disk D to the upper half-plane G.\n\nLet's consider the following Möbius transformation:\n\nf(z) = (z - i) / (z + i)\n\nNow, let's check if this function maps D to G:\n\n1. f is holomorphic: The function f(z) is a rational function of z with a non-zero denominator, so it is holomorphic.\n\n2. f maps D to G: Let z = x + yi ∈ D, where x and y are real numbers and |z| < 1. Then,\n\nf(z) = ((x + yi) - i) / ((x + yi) + i) = (x + (y - 1)i) / (x + (y + 1)i)\n\nNow, let's compute the imaginary part of f(z):\n\nIm(f(z)) = Im((x + (y - 1)i)(x - (y + 1)i) / (x^2 + (y + 1)^2))\n= Im((x^2 + (y^2 - 1)) / (x^2 + (y + 1)^2))\n= (2y) / (x^2 + (y + 1)^2)\n\nSince |z| < 1, we have y^2 < 1 - x^2, which implies y < 1. Therefore, 0 < y < 1, and the imaginary part of f(z) is positive. Thus, f(z) ∈ G.\n\n3. f is bijective: The inverse of the Möbius transformation f(z) is given by:\n\nf^(-1)(w) = (dw - b) / (-cw + a)\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = -i, c = 1, and d = i. So,\n\nf^(-1)(w) = (iw + i) / (-w + 1)\n\nThis inverse function is also holomorphic, and it maps G back to D. Therefore, f is bijective.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) = (z - i) / (z + i) is a biholomorphism from the open unit disk D to the upper half-plane G."
