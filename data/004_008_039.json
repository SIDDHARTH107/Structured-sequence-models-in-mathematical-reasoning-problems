    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line at a given point, we need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x, and then evaluate it at the given x-coordinate.\n\nThe given equation is y = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 1.\n\nLet's find the derivative dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = d(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 1)/dx\n     = 3(2x^2) - 2(5x) + 3\n     = 6x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at the given x-coordinate (x = 2):\n\ndy/dx(2) = 6(2)^2 - 10(2) + 3\n         = 6(4) - 20 + 3\n         = 24 - 20 + 3\n         = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 7) is 7."
