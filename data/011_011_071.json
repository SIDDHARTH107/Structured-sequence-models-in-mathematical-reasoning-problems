    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to partition the number 10 into distinct summands, we can use the concept of partitioning in combinatorics. \n\nA partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. The order of the summands does not matter, so the partitions are considered distinct if they have different summands. \n\nFor the number 10, we can find the following partitions with distinct summands:\n\n1. {1, 2, 3, 4}\n2. {1, 2, 7}\n3. {1, 3, 6}\n4. {2, 3, 5}\n\nSo, there are 4 ways to partition the number 10 into distinct summands."
