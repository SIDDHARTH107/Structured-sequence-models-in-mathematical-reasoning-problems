    "message_2": "First, let's recall some basic facts about groups and their orders:\n\n1. If a group G has order n, then by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide n.\n2. If a group G has order n, and p is a prime number dividing n, then by Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order p.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, where 2 and 5 are prime numbers, by Cauchy's theorem, G has elements a and b of orders 2 and 5, respectively. Let H be the subgroup generated by b, so |H| = 5. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H is a cyclic group and isomorphic to C5.\n\nNow consider the element a. Since a has order 2, a^2 = e (the identity element of G). We have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: a * b = b * a\nIn this case, G is an abelian group. We can define a group homomorphism φ: G → C10 by φ(a^i * b^j) = c^(2i + 5j), where c is a generator of C10 with order 10. It is easy to verify that φ is a group homomorphism:\n\nφ((a^i * b^j)(a^k * b^l)) = φ(a^(i+k) * b^(j+l)) = c^(2(i+k) + 5(j+l)) = c^(2i + 5j) * c^(2k + 5l) = φ(a^i * b^j) * φ(a^k * b^l)\n\nSince G has 10 elements and C10 has 10 elements, φ is a bijective group homomorphism, and thus G is isomorphic to C10.\n\nCase 2: a * b ≠ b * a\nIn this case, G is a non-abelian group. We can show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5 or the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nDefine a group homomorphism ψ: G → D5 by ψ(a^i * b^j) = r^j * s^i, where r and s are the standard generators of D5 with orders 5 and 2, respectively. It is easy to verify that ψ is a group homomorphism:\n\nψ((a^i * b^j)(a^k * b^l)) = ψ(a^(i+k) * b^(j+l)) = r^(j+l) * s^(i+k) = (r^j * s^i)(r^l * s^k) = ψ(a^i * b^j) * ψ(a^k * b^l)\n\nSince G has 10 elements and D5 has 10 elements, ψ is a bijective group homomorphism, and thus G is isomorphic to D5.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that for any group G of order 10, there exists a bijective group homomorphism from G to one of the groups C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10, and thus G is isomorphic to one of these groups."
