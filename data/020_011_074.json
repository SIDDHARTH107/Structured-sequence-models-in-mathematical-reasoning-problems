    "message_1": "A company produces two types of toys: cars and dolls. The company can produce a maximum of 5000 toys per day, and the production process requires 2 hours of labor for every 5 cars produced or 1 hour of labor for every 4 dolls produced. The company has a maximum of 2000 labor hours per day. The profit for each car sold is $5 and for each doll sold is $3. The company wants to find the optimum number of cars and dolls to produce per day to maximize profit. What is the maximum profit that the company can make per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of cars produced and y be the number of dolls produced.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 5000 (maximum number of toys produced per day)\n2. (2/5)x + (1/4)y ≤ 2000 (maximum labor hours per day)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 3y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region determined by the constraints. To do this, we'll solve the inequalities for y:\n\n1. y ≤ 5000 - x\n2. y ≤ (8000 - 2x)/4\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. These are the points where the constraints intersect. We have the following intersections:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 5000 (intersection of constraint 1 and y-axis)\n2. x = 5000, y = 0 (intersection of constraint 1 and x-axis)\n3. x = 0, y = 2000 (intersection of constraint 2 and y-axis)\n4. x = 3200, y = 1800 (intersection of constraints 1 and 2)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 5000) = 5(0) + 3(5000) = $15,000\n2. P(5000, 0) = 5(5000) + 3(0) = $25,000\n3. P(0, 2000) = 5(0) + 3(2000) = $6,000\n4. P(3200, 1800) = 5(3200) + 3(1800) = $22,400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (5000, 0), which corresponds to producing 5000 cars and 0 dolls. The maximum profit the company can make per day is $25,000."
