    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 between the interval [0, 2], we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 0 to 2.\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 2x + 1) dx from 0 to 2\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative of x^2 is (1/3)x^3\nAntiderivative of 2x is x^2\nAntiderivative of 1 is x\n\nSo, the antiderivative of the function is (1/3)x^3 + x^2 + x.\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\n((1/3)(2)^3 + (2)^2 + 2) - ((1/3)(0)^3 + (0)^2 + 0)\n\n= ((1/3)(8) + 4 + 2) - (0)\n\n= (8/3 + 4 + 2)\n\n= (8/3 + 12/3 + 6/3)\n\n= (26/3)\n\nSo, the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 between the interval [0, 2] is 26/3 square units."
