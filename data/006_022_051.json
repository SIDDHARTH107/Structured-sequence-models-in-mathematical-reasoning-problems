    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 8 out of 10 students will pass the exam, we need to consider the probabilities of exactly 8, 9, and 10 students passing the exam. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.75 in this case), and n is the total number of trials (10 students).\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of exactly 8 students passing the exam:\n\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * (0.75)^8 * (1-0.75)^(10-8)\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.75)^8 * (0.25)^2\n\nNext, let's find the probability of exactly 9 students passing the exam:\n\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * (0.75)^9 * (1-0.75)^(10-9)\nP(X = 9) = 10 * (0.75)^9 * (0.25)^1\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of all 10 students passing the exam:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * (0.75)^10 * (1-0.75)^(10-10)\nP(X = 10) = 1 * (0.75)^10 * (0.25)^0\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 8 students passing by adding the probabilities of exactly 8, 9, and 10 students passing:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 8) ≈ 45 * 0.1001 * 0.0625 ≈ 0.2816\nP(X = 9) ≈ 10 * 0.0751 * 0.25 ≈ 0.1883\nP(X = 10) ≈ 1 * 0.0563 * 1 ≈ 0.0563\n\nP(X ≥ 8) ≈ 0.2816 + 0.1883 + 0.0563 ≈ 0.5262\n\nSo, the probability that at least 8 out of 10 students will pass the exam is approximately 0.5262 or 52.62%."
