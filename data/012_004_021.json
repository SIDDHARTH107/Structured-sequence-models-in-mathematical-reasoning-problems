    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\nSorted edges by weight: (A, B, 1), (B, D, 1), (C, D, 2), (A, C, 3), (B, C, 4), (A, D, 5)\n\nNow, let's add the edges to the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add edge (A, B, 1): MST = {(A, B, 1)}\n2. Add edge (B, D, 1): MST = {(A, B, 1), (B, D, 1)}\n3. Add edge (C, D, 2): MST = {(A, B, 1), (B, D, 1), (C, D, 2)}\n\nAt this point, all vertices are included in the MST, and adding any more edges would create a cycle. So, we stop here.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is: {(A, B, 1), (B, D, 1), (C, D, 2)}\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4."
