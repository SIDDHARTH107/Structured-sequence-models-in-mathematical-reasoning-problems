    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg that is 5 cm long and the hypotenuse is 13 cm. What is the length of the other leg, using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the other leg be x cm. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n5^2 + x^2 = 13^2\n\n25 + x^2 = 169\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 169 - 25\nx^2 = 144\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nx = âˆš144\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
