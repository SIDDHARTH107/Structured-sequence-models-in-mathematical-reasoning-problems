    "message_2": "To find the smallest and largest angles of the triangle, we will use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides, respectively:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nLet's label the sides of the triangle as follows:\na = 30 meters\nb = 40 meters\nc = 50 meters\n\nWe will first find the smallest angle, which is opposite the shortest side (a = 30 meters). We will solve for angle A using the Law of Cosines:\n\n30² = 40² + 50² - 2 * 40 * 50 * cos(A)\n\n900 = 1600 + 2500 - 4000 * cos(A)\n900 = 4100 - 4000 * cos(A)\n\nNow, isolate cos(A):\ncos(A) = (4100 - 900) / 4000\ncos(A) = 3200 / 4000\ncos(A) = 0.8\n\nNow, find the angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0.8:\nA = arccos(0.8)\nA ≈ 36.87°\n\nNow, let's find the largest angle, which is opposite the longest side (c = 50 meters). We will solve for angle C using the Law of Cosines:\n\n50² = 30² + 40² - 2 * 30 * 40 * cos(C)\n\n2500 = 900 + 1600 - 2400 * cos(C)\n2500 = 2500 - 2400 * cos(C)\n\nNow, isolate cos(C):\ncos(C) = (2500 - 2500) / 2400\ncos(C) = 0\n\nNow, find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0:\nC = arccos(0)\nC = 90°\n\nSo, the smallest angle is approximately 36.87°, and the largest angle is 90°."
