In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is commutative by finding B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince union and intersection are commutative, we have:\n\nB ∪ A = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ∩ A = A ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nSo, B Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5}\n\nSince A Δ B = {1, 2, 5} and B Δ A = {1, 2, 5}, we can conclude that the symmetric difference is commutative:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A"
