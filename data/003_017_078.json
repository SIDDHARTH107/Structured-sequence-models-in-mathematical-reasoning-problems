    "message_1": "A flag on a flagpole oscillates back and forth due to wind. The height of the flagpole is 15 meters and the flag oscillates with a period of 2 seconds. If the flag is modeled with the function h(t) = 5sin(πt) + 10, where t is the time in seconds, find the average height of the flag above the ground over one complete oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To find the average height of the flag above the ground over one complete oscillation, we need to integrate the function h(t) over one period and then divide by the length of the period.\n\nThe given function is h(t) = 5sin(πt) + 10, and the period is 2 seconds.\n\nFirst, let's integrate h(t) over one period:\n\n∫(5sin(πt) + 10) dt from 0 to 2\n\n= ∫(5sin(πt)) dt + ∫(10) dt from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we'll integrate each part separately:\n\n∫(5sin(πt)) dt = (-5/π)cos(πt) + C\n∫(10) dt = 10t + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integrals at the limits 0 and 2:\n\n((-5/π)cos(2π) - (-5/π)cos(0)) + (10(2) - 10(0))\n\n= ((-5/π)(1) - (-5/π)(1)) + (20 - 0)\n\n= 0 + 20\n\nNow, we'll divide the result by the length of the period (2 seconds) to find the average height:\n\nAverage height = (20) / 2 = 10 meters\n\nSo, the average height of the flag above the ground over one complete oscillation is 10 meters."
