    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10. By Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element of order 2 and an element of order 5 in G. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 5. Then, the orders of a and b are 2 and 5, respectively.\n\nNow, consider the following two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has exactly one element of order 2.\n\nIn this case, G must be a cyclic group, as there is only one element of order 2. Since the order of G is 10, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_10.\n\nCase 2: G has more than one element of order 2.\n\nLet's assume that G has k elements of order 2. Since the order of G is 10, there are 10 - k elements left. Among these remaining elements, there must be an element of order 5 (which is b). The other 9 - k elements must be the powers of b, i.e., b^2, b^3, b^4, and the identity element e.\n\nNow, we know that the number of elements of order 5 is 4 (as the powers of b have order 5). So, we have k elements of order 2 and 4 elements of order 5. Therefore, k = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nSo, G has 6 elements of order 2. Since G is non-abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_10. The only other non-abelian group of order 10 is the dihedral group D5. Thus, G must be isomorphic to D5.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group of order 10 has exactly one element of order 2, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_10. If it has more than one element of order 2 (specifically, 6 elements), it must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D5."
