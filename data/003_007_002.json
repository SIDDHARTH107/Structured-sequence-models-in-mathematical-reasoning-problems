    "message_1": "A triangle has a side length of 5 cm and another side length of 8 cm. The angle between these two sides is 60 degrees. What is the length of the third side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side of the triangle. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and an angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm, b = 8 cm, and C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 5² + 8² - 2 * 5 * 8 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 25 + 64 - 80 * (1/2)\nc² = 89 - 40\nc² = 49\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\n\nc = √49\nc = 7 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the triangle is 7 cm."
