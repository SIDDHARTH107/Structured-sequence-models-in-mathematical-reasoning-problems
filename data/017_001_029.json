    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4, we will first show that G must have three elements of order 2, and then show that the group operation table of G is the same as that of V4.\n\nSince G is not cyclic, it cannot have an element of order 4. Let's consider the possible orders of the elements in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G, which is 4. So, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 2.\n\nThere must be exactly one element of order 1, which is the identity element e. Let a be an element of order 2 in G. Since G is not cyclic, there must be another element b in G which is not a power of a. The order of b cannot be 4 (otherwise G would be cyclic), so it must be 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the product ab. If ab = e, then b = a^{-1}, but since a has order 2, a^{-1} = a, which means b = a, which is a contradiction. So, ab â‰  e. If ab = a, then b = e, which is also a contradiction. Similarly, if ab = b, then a = e, which is another contradiction. Therefore, ab must be a distinct element in G, and since G has only 4 elements, G = {e, a, b, ab}.\n\nNow, let's check the orders of the elements in G. We already know that a and b have order 2. Since (ab)^2 = abab, and G is a group, we have:\n\n(abab)(a^{-1}b^{-1}) = e\n(abab)(a^{-1}a)(b^{-1}b) = e\n(abab)(ee) = e\n(abab) = e\n\nSo, ab also has order 2. Thus, G has three elements of order 2.\n\nNow, let's construct the group operation table for G:\n\n```\n   |  e  a  b  ab\n---+-------------\n e |  e  a  b  ab\n a |  a  e  ab b\n b |  b  ab e  a\nab |  ab b  a  e\n```\n\nThis is the group operation table for the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4."
