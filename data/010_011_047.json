    "message_2": "To find the transition function $ϕ_2 \\circ ϕ_1$, we first need to find the intersection of the domains $U_1$ and $U_2$, which is the region where both coordinate charts are defined. In this case, we have:\n\n$$U_1 \\cap U_2 = (0, 5) \\cap (-2, 0) = \\emptyset$$\n\nSince the intersection is empty, there is no overlap between the two coordinate charts, and the transition function $ϕ_2 \\circ ϕ_1$ is not defined. In this case, the atlas is not sufficient to cover the entire manifold, and additional coordinate charts would be needed to provide a complete description of the manifold."
