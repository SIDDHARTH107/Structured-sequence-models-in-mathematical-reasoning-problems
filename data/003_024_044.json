    "message_2": "To determine the velocity of the ship in an eastward and northward direction, we can use the concept of vector components. Since the ship is sailing at a bearing of 045°, this means that the angle between the ship's velocity vector and the eastward direction is 45°. We can use trigonometry to find the eastward and northward components of the ship's velocity vector.\n\nLet V_east be the eastward component of the velocity and V_north be the northward component of the velocity. We can use the following trigonometric relationships:\n\nV_east = V * cos(θ)\nV_north = V * sin(θ)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the ship's velocity (20 km/h) and θ is the angle between the ship's velocity vector and the eastward direction (45°).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 45° * (π / 180) = π / 4\n\nNow, we can find the eastward and northward components of the velocity:\n\nV_east = 20 * cos(π / 4) = 20 * (√2 / 2) = 10√2 km/h\nV_north = 20 * sin(π / 4) = 20 * (√2 / 2) = 10√2 km/h\n\nSo, the velocity of the ship in an eastward direction is 10√2 km/h, and the velocity of the ship in a northward direction is also 10√2 km/h."
