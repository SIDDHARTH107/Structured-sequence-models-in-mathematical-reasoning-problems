    "message_2": "To find the Lyapunov exponent for the given system of differential equations, we first need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the linear system. The matrix A for the given system is:\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n      | -4  9 |\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is given by:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. The characteristic equation for the given matrix A is:\n\n(2 - λ)(9 - λ) - (-4)(3) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nλ^2 - 11λ + 18 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find the roots (eigenvalues) using the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = -11, and c = 18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nλ = (11 ± √((-11)^2 - 4(1)(18))) / 2(1)\nλ = (11 ± √(121 - 72)) / 2\nλ = (11 ± √49) / 2\nλ = (11 ± 7) / 2\n\nSo, we have two eigenvalues:\n\nλ1 = (11 + 7) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9\nλ2 = (11 - 7) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is related to the eigenvalues of the matrix A. In this case, since we have a 2D system, we have two Lyapunov exponents, one for each eigenvalue. The Lyapunov exponent is given by the real part of the eigenvalue:\n\nLyapunov exponent 1 = Re(λ1) = 9\nLyapunov exponent 2 = Re(λ2) = 2\n\nSo, the Lyapunov exponents for the given system of differential equations are 9 and 2."
