    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 6 with a binary operation * defined on it. Since G is a group, it must satisfy the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, a * b is also in G.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n3. Identity: There exists an element e in G such that for all a in G, e * a = a * e = a.\n4. Inverse: For every element a in G, there exists an element a' in G such that a * a' = a' * a = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the order of elements in G. Let a be an element in G. The order of a, denoted as |a|, is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where a^n denotes the n-fold product of a with itself.\n\nSince G has order 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nLet's analyze the possible structures of G based on the order of its elements:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 6.\nIf G has an element a with order 6, then the cyclic subgroup generated by a, <a> = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}, has 6 elements. Since G has 6 elements, G = <a>, and G is a cyclic group of order 6, which is isomorphic to C6.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 6.\nIn this case, G must have elements of order 1, 2, and 3. The element of order 1 is the identity element e. Let a be an element of order 2, and b be an element of order 3. Then, a^2 = e and b^3 = e.\n\nNow, consider the element c = a * b. Since G is a group, c is also in G. We want to find the order of c. Note that (a * b)^2 = a * b * a * b. Since a has order 2, a * a = a^2 = e, and we have (a * b)^2 = b * a * b. Similarly, (a * b)^3 = a * b * a * b * a * b = b * a * b * a * b. \n\nWe know that b has order 3, so b^3 = e. Thus, (a * b)^3 = b * a * e = b * a. We can see that the orders of c = a * b are not 1, 2, or 3, as none of these powers of c equal the identity element e. However, this contradicts our earlier statement that the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we conclude that G must be isomorphic to C6 or D3. Since we have shown that G cannot have the structure described in Case 2, G must be isomorphic to C6."
