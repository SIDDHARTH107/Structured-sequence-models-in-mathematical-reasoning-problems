    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n3. Two groups are isomorphic if and only if their Sylow subgroups are isomorphic.\n\nThe prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. Therefore, a group of order 60 has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4, Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3, and Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for a prime p divides the order of the group and is congruent to 1 modulo p. Thus, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 1, 3, 5, or 15; the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1 or 4; and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is the direct product of these subgroups, and we get a group isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_60.\n\n2. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and six Sylow 5-subgroups, then the group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_4 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_5. There are four possible actions of Z_5 on Z_4 × Z_3, but only two of them yield non-isomorphic groups. These two groups are the dihedral group D_10 of order 20 and a non-abelian group of order 60.\n\n3. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_4 × Z_5) ⋊ Z_3. There are two possible actions of Z_3 on Z_4 × Z_5, yielding two non-isomorphic groups: the dihedral group D_6 of order 12 and a non-abelian group of order 60.\n\n4. If there are fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, four Sylow 3-subgroups, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_5) ⋊ Z_2. There is only one possible action of Z_2 on Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_5, yielding the alternating group A_5 of order 60.\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 60: Z_60, D_10, D_6, A_5, and two non-abelian groups of order 60."
