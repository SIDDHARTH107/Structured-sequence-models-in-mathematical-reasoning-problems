    "message_2": "To find the frequency-domain representation of the given signal f(t) = 3sin(2πt) + 5cos(4πt), we can use the Fourier transform. However, since the given function is already in the sum of sinusoids form, we can directly read off the amplitudes and frequencies of its constituent sinusoids.\n\nThe given function can be written as:\n\nf(t) = 3sin(2πt) + 5cos(4πt)\n\nHere, we have two sinusoids:\n\n1. A sinusoid with amplitude A1 = 3 and frequency f1 = 1 Hz (since the argument of the sine function is 2πt, and 2πf1t = 2πt, so f1 = 1 Hz).\n\n2. A sinusoid with amplitude A2 = 5 and frequency f2 = 2 Hz (since the argument of the cosine function is 4πt, and 2πf2t = 4πt, so f2 = 2 Hz).\n\nSo, the frequency-domain representation of the signal consists of two sinusoids with amplitudes A1 = 3 and A2 = 5, and frequencies f1 = 1 Hz and f2 = 2 Hz."
