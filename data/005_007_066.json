The data is given in the following table:\n\n| Hours studied | Exam score |\n|--------------|------------|\n| 5            | 60         |\n| 10           | 70         |\n| 12           | 72         |\n| 20           | 85         |\n| 15           | 76         |\n| 7            | 65         |\n| 9            | 68         |\n| 16           | 82         |\n| 18           | 84         |\n| 21           | 88         |\n| 8            | 67         |\n| 11           | 72         |\n| 13           | 75         |\n| 17           | 83         |\n| 19           | 80         |\n| 22           | 89         |\n| 6            | 62         |\n| 14           | 78         |\n| 16           | 80         |\n| 19           | 84         |\n| 22           | 90         |\n| 10           | 72         |\n| 11           | 76         |\n| 12           | 77         |\n| 14           | 80         |\n| 17           | 82         |\n| 20           | 86         |\n| 23           | 91         |\n| 9            | 70         |\n| 15           | 77         |\n\na) Calculate the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the final exam scores.\nb) Interpret the result and discuss the strength of the relationship between the two variables.",
    "message_2": "a) To calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r), we will first find the mean of both the hours studied and exam scores, and then use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / sqrt(Σ(xi - x_mean)^2 * Σ(yi - y_mean)^2)\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, and x_mean and y_mean are the means of the respective variables.\n\nMean of hours studied (x_mean) = (5+10+12+20+15+7+9+16+18+21+8+11+13+17+19+22+6+14+16+19+22+10+11+12+14+17+20+23+9+15) / 30 = 420 / 30 = 14\n\nMean of exam scores (y_mean) = (60+70+72+85+76+65+68+82+84+88+67+72+75+83+80+89+62+78+80+84+90+72+76+77+80+82+86+91+70+77) / 30 = 2344 / 30 = 78.1333\n\nNow, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] = (5-14)(60-78.1333) + (10-14)(70-78.1333) + ... + (15-14)(77-78.1333) = 1020.8\n\nDenominator = sqrt(Σ(xi - x_mean)^2 * Σ(yi - y_mean)^2) = sqrt((5-14)^2 + (10-14)^2 + ... + (15-14)^2) * ((60-78.1333)^2 + (70-78.1333)^2 + ... + (77-78.1333)^2) = sqrt(784 * 5046.933) = 87.9344\n\nFinally, we will calculate the correlation coefficient:\n\nr = 1020.8 / 87.9344 = 11.605\n\nb) The correlation coefficient r = 11.605 indicates a strong positive relationship between the number of hours studied and the final exam scores. This means that as the number of hours studied increases, the final exam scores also tend to increase. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and there may be other factors affecting the relationship between these two variables."
