    "message_1": "A manufacturing company claims that their production line produces light bulbs with an average lifespan of 1200 hours. A sample of 36 bulbs had an average lifespan of 1180 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. \n\nUsing a significance level of 0.05, can we reject the manufacturer's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true average lifespan of the light bulbs is 1200 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true average lifespan is not 1200 hours.\n\nGiven data:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 1200 hours\nSample mean (x̄) = 1180 hours\nSample size (n) = 36\nSample standard deviation (s) = 100 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (1180 - 1200) / (100 / √36)\nt = -20 / (100 / 6)\nt = -20 / 16.67\nt ≈ -1.20\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 35 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.03.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-1.20) is within the range of the critical t-values (-2.03 to 2.03), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is not enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim that the average lifespan of the light bulbs is 1200 hours at a 0.05 significance level."
