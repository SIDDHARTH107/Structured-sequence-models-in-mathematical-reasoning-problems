    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', can be found by subtracting the elements of A from U:\n\nA' = U - A = {5,6,7,8}\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either one of the sets or in both. In this case, since A and A' have no elements in common, the union will simply be the combination of all elements in A and A':\n\nA ∪ A' = {1,2,3,4} ∪ {5,6,7,8} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}\n\nAs we can see, the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U. This confirms that the union of a set and its complement is always equal to the universal set."
