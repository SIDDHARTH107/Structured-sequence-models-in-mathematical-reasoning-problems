    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion for the function f(z) = 1/(z-2) about the point z=1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z-1). Let w = z-1, then z = w+1. The function becomes:\n\nf(w) = 1/((w+1)-2) = 1/(w-1)\n\nNow, we want to find the Laurent series expansion of f(w) = 1/(w-1) that is valid for 1 < |w| < 2. We can use the geometric series formula:\n\n1/(1-x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nIn our case, x = -w:\n\n1/(1-(-w)) = 1 - w + w^2 - w^3 + ...\n\nNow, we substitute back z-1 for w:\n\nf(z) = 1 - (z-1) + (z-1)^2 - (z-1)^3 + ...\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion for the function f(z) = 1/(z-2) about the point z=1, valid for 1 < |z-1| < 2."
