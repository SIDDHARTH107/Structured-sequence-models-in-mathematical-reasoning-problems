    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges, we can use depth-first search (DFS) and keep track of the discovery time and the lowest reachable vertex for each vertex in the graph.\n\nAfter analyzing the given graph, we can determine the following:\n\nCut vertices: B, C, and D\nBridges: (B, C), (C, D), and (C, E)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Removing vertex B disconnects the graph into two components: {A, B, C, D, E} and {F, G, H}.\n2. Removing vertex C disconnects the graph into two components: {A, B} and {C, D, E, F, G, H}.\n3. Removing vertex D disconnects the graph into two components: {A, B, C} and {D, E, F, G, H}.\n\nThe bridges are the edges that, when removed, increase the number of connected components:\n\n1. Removing edge (B, C) disconnects the graph into two components: {A, B} and {C, D, E, F, G, H}.\n2. Removing edge (C, D) disconnects the graph into two components: {A, B, C} and {D, E, F, G, H}.\n3. Removing edge (C, E) disconnects the graph into two components: {A, B, C, D} and {E, F, G, H}."
