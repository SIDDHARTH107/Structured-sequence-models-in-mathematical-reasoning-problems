    "message_2": "To calculate the number of elements in A's power set, we use the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in set A. In this case, n = 4.\n\n2^4 = 16\n\nSo, the power set of A contains 16 elements.\n\nNow, to prove that the power set of A is always larger than A itself, let's consider the general case where A has n elements. The power set of A will have 2^n elements. We need to show that 2^n > n for all n.\n\nWe can prove this by induction.\n\nBase case: n = 1\n2^1 = 2 > 1, so the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that 2^k > k for some k ≥ 1. We need to show that 2^(k+1) > k + 1.\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k (by the properties of exponents)\n\nSince we assumed that 2^k > k, it follows that 2 * 2^k > 2 * k. Now, we need to show that 2 * k ≥ k + 1 for all k ≥ 1.\n\n2 * k - k = k ≥ 1, which is true for all k ≥ 1.\n\nThus, 2 * 2^k > 2 * k ≥ k + 1, which implies that 2^(k+1) > k + 1.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, 2^n > n for all n, which means that the power set of A is always larger than A itself."
