    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into cases based on the number of slow songs in each group.\n\nCase 1: 1 slow song and 3 fast songs\nThere are 3 ways to choose 1 slow song (since there are 3 slow songs available) and C(7,3) ways to choose 3 fast songs from the 7 available. So, there are 3 * C(7,3) combinations for this case.\n\nCase 2: 2 slow songs and 2 fast songs\nThere are C(3,2) ways to choose 2 slow songs from the 3 available and C(7,2) ways to choose 2 fast songs from the 7 available. So, there are C(3,2) * C(7,2) combinations for this case.\n\nCase 3: 3 slow songs and 1 fast song\nThere are C(3,3) ways to choose all 3 slow songs and 7 ways to choose 1 fast song (since there are 7 fast songs available). So, there are C(3,3) * 7 combinations for this case.\n\nNow, we can calculate the combinations for each case and sum them up:\n\nCase 1: 3 * C(7,3) = 3 * 35 = 105\nCase 2: C(3,2) * C(7,2) = 3 * 21 = 63\nCase 3: C(3,3) * 7 = 1 * 7 = 7\n\nTotal combinations = 105 + 63 + 7 = 175\n\nSo, there are 175 distinct groups of 4 songs that can be played in a karaoke night with the given conditions."
