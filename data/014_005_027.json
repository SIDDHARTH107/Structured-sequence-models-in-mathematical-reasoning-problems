    "message_2": "To sign a message using the ElGamal digital signature scheme, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the message \"HELLO\" into a numerical representation. We can use the ASCII values of the characters: H=72, E=69, L=76, L=76, O=79. We can concatenate these numbers to form a single number: 7269767679.\n\n2. Choose a random number k, which is relatively prime to (p-1), where p is the first element of the public key. Let's choose k=5.\n\n3. Calculate r = (g^k) mod p, where g is the second element of the public key. In this case, r = (5^5) mod 33 = 22.\n\n4. Calculate s = (m - x*r) * k^(-1) mod (p-1), where m is the numerical representation of the message, x is the private key, and k^(-1) is the modular inverse of k modulo (p-1). In this case, s = (7269767679 - 3*22) * 5^(-1) mod 32 = 7269767593 * 21 mod 32 = 29.\n\nThe signature of the message \"HELLO\" is the pair (r, s) = (22, 29)."
