    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin tosses)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting a head) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting a tail) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin tosses), which is 7 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want, which is 4 in this case\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 4) = (7C4) * (0.5^4) * (0.5^(7-4))\n\nFirst, let's calculate 7C4:\n\n7C4 = 7! / (4!(7-4)!)\n= 7! / (4!3!)\n= (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\n= (7*6*5) / (3*2*1)\n= 35\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 4) = 35 * (0.5^4) * (0.5^3)\n= 35 * 0.0625 * 0.125\n= 35 * 0.0078125\n= 0.2734375\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 7 coin tosses is approximately 0.2734 or 27.34%."
