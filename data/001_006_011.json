    "message_2": "To find the vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b / 2a. In this case, a = 2, b = -3, and c = 1.\n\nx = -(-3) / 2(2) = 3 / 4\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can plug it back into the equation to find the y-coordinate:\n\ny = 2(3/4)^2 - 3(3/4) + 1\ny = 2(9/16) - 9/4 + 1\ny = 9/8 - 9/4 + 1\ny = 9/8 - 18/8 + 8/8\ny = (9 - 18 + 8) / 8\ny = -1/8\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of the vertex is -1/8.\n\nTo graph the equation, you can plot the vertex (3/4, -1/8) and a few other points by plugging in different x-values into the equation. For example, you can plug in x = 0, x = 1, x = 2, etc., and find the corresponding y-values. Then, connect the points with a smooth curve to form the parabola."
