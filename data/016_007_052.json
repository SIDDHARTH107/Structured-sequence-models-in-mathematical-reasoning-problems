    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from the original cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 20 smaller cubes, each with a side length of 1/3 of the original cube. So, the volume of the remaining structure is 20 * (1/3)^3.\n\nAfter the second iteration, there are 20^2 smaller cubes, each with a side length of (1/3)^4 of the original cube. So, the volume of the remaining structure is 20^2 * (1/3)^6.\n\nAfter the third iteration, there are 20^3 smaller cubes, each with a side length of (1/3)^7 of the original cube. So, the volume of the remaining structure is 20^3 * (1/3)^9.\n\nAfter the fourth iteration, there are 20^4 smaller cubes, each with a side length of (1/3)^10 of the original cube. So, the volume of the remaining structure is 20^4 * (1/3)^12.\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the Menger sponge after four iterations:\n\nVolume = 20^4 * (1/3)^12 * (original cube volume)\nVolume = 20^4 * (1/3)^12 * (3^3)\nVolume = 160000 * (1/531441) * 27\nVolume = 160000 * 27 / 531441\nVolume = 4320000 / 531441\nVolume â‰ˆ 8.1247 cubic units"
