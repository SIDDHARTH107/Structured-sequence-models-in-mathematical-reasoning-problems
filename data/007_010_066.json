    "message_1": "Suppose we have a number which when divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1 and when divided by 4 gives a remainder of 2. What is the smallest number that satisfies these conditions?",
    "message_2": "Let the number be x. According to the given conditions, we can write the following equations:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 4)\n\nTo find the smallest number that satisfies these conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, in this case, we can also find the solution by simply checking the numbers that satisfy the second equation and see if they also satisfy the first equation.\n\nStarting with the second equation, the first few numbers that give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 are 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, and so on. Now let's check which of these numbers give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3:\n\n2 % 3 = 2 (not a solution)\n6 % 3 = 0 (not a solution)\n10 % 3 = 1 (solution)\n\nSo, the smallest number that satisfies both conditions is 10."
