The delivery times are 9am-10am for Location A, 10am-11am for Location B, 11am-12pm for Location C, 1pm-2pm for Location D, and 2pm-3pm for Location E. The driver starts at Location A and wants to plan the most efficient route to visit all 5 locations in the minimum amount of time, while respecting the delivery time windows. What is the optimal routing for the driver?",
