    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 27 = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since 27 = 3^3, the only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let P be this unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^3 = 27, which is the same as the order of G, we have that P = G. Therefore, G is a 3-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z_27, Z_9 x Z_3, or Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_3. \n\nHowever, we can eliminate the last possibility, Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_3, because it has no element of order 27, while a cyclic group of order 27 must have an element of order 27. Thus, G must be isomorphic to either Z_27 or Z_9 x Z_3.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, let P, Q, and R be distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since the intersection of distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have that |P ∩ Q| = 1, |P ∩ R| = 1, and |Q ∩ R| = 1. \n\nNow, consider the product PQ. Since |P| = |Q| = 9, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 9 * 9 / 1 = 81. However, this is impossible, as |PQ| must divide the order of G, which is 27. This contradiction implies that there cannot be three Sylow 3-subgroups in G.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that G is isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 27 or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
