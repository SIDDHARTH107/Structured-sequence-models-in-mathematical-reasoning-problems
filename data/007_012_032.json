So, we are looking for the smallest prime number p, such that (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nLet's start with the smallest prime number, which is 2:\n\n(2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2 is divisible by 2, so the smallest positive integer n such that (n - 1)! + 1 is divisible by n, according to Wilson's theorem, is n = 2."
