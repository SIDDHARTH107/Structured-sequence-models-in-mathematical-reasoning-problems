    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time, which will give us the velocity function $v(t)$. \n\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(4t^3 - 3t^2 - 40t) = 12t^2 - 6t - 40$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t=2$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(2) = 12(2)^2 - 6(2) - 40 = 12(4) - 12 - 40 = 48 - 12 - 40 = -4$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t=2$ seconds is $-4$ meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we need to find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time, which will give us the acceleration function $a(t)$.\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(4t^3 - 3t^2 - 40t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(12t^2 - 6t - 40) = 24t - 6$\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration at $t=2$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$ into the acceleration function:\n\n$a(2) = 24(2) - 6 = 48 - 6 = 42$\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at $t=2$ seconds is $42$ meters per second squared.\n\nIn summary, at $t=2$ seconds, the car has a velocity of $-4$ m/s and an acceleration of $42$ m/sÂ²."
