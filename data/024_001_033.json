    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of a space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the given vector function r(t).\n\nGiven r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t), let's find the first and second derivatives:\n\nr'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1)\nr''(t) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vector T(t), which is the unit tangent vector of r'(t):\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt((-sin(t))^2 + (cos(t))^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1)\n\nSince the magnitude is 1, the tangent vector T(t) is equal to r'(t):\n\nT(t) = r'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the tangent vector T'(t):\n\nT'(t) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)\n\nTo find the curvature k(t), we need to find the magnitude of T'(t) and divide it by the magnitude of r'(t):\n\nk(t) = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)||\n\nSince ||r'(t)|| = 1, we only need to find the magnitude of T'(t):\n\n||T'(t)|| = sqrt((-cos(t))^2 + (-sin(t))^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(1)\n\nSo, the curvature k(t) is:\n\nk(t) = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)|| = sqrt(1) / 1 = 1\n\nNow, let's find the torsion τ(t). We need to find the derivative of the binormal vector B(t), which is the cross product of T(t) and N(t), where N(t) is the normal vector. First, let's find N(t):\n\nN(t) = T'(t) / ||T'(t)|| = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0) / sqrt(1) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)\n\nNow, let's find the binormal vector B(t):\n\nB(t) = T(t) x N(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1) x (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0) = (sin^2(t) + cos^2(t), sin(t), -cos(t))\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the binormal vector B'(t):\n\nB'(t) = (0, cos(t), sin(t))\n\nTo find the torsion τ(t), we need to find the dot product of B'(t) and N(t), and divide it by the magnitude of r'(t):\n\nτ(t) = (B'(t) • N(t)) / ||r'(t)|| = (0 * (-cos(t)) + cos(t) * (-sin(t)) + sin(t) * 0) / 1 = -cos(t) * sin(t)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature and torsion at t = pi/4:\n\nk(pi/4) = 1\nτ(pi/4) = -cos(pi/4) * sin(pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2)/2 = -1/2\n\nSo, the curvature of the space curve at t = pi/4 is 1, and the torsion is -1/2."
