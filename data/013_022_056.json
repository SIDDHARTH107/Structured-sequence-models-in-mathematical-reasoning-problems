    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player A is given $100 and is asked to share any amount with Player B. If Player A shares $x with Player B, Player B receives $x and Player A keeps the remaining $(100-x). If Player B's utility function is represented by U(B)=√x, what is the amount that Player A should share to maximize the sum of their utilities?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the sum of their utilities, we need to find the optimal value of x that maximizes the sum of Player A's utility and Player B's utility. Let's denote Player A's utility as U(A) and Player B's utility as U(B).\n\nSince Player A's utility is the amount of money they keep, we have:\n\nU(A) = 100 - x\n\nPlayer B's utility is given as:\n\nU(B) = √x\n\nNow, we want to maximize the sum of their utilities, which is:\n\nU(A) + U(B) = (100 - x) + √x\n\nTo find the maximum, we can take the derivative of this function with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(U(A) + U(B))/dx = -1 + 1/(2√x) = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n1/(2√x) = 1\n\n2√x = 1\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n4x = 1\n\nx = 1/4\n\nSo, Player A should share $0.25 (25 cents) with Player B to maximize the sum of their utilities. However, since we are dealing with whole dollars, Player A should share $1 with Player B to maximize the sum of their utilities in practice."
