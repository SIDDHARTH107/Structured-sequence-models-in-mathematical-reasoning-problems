    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 2 heads, we can find the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and the probability of getting 3 heads, and then add those probabilities together.\n\nThere are 8 possible outcomes when tossing a fair coin 3 times (HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT). \n\nThere are 3 outcomes with exactly 2 heads: HHT, HTH, and THH. So the probability of getting exactly 2 heads is 3/8.\n\nThere is 1 outcome with 3 heads: HHH. So the probability of getting 3 heads is 1/8.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of getting exactly 2 heads and 3 heads together:\n\nP(at least 2 heads) = P(2 heads) + P(3 heads) = (3/8) + (1/8) = 4/8 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is 1/2 or 50%."
