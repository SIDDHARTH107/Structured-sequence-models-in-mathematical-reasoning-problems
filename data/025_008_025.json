Let $H^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})$ denote the first singular cohomology group of $C$ with integer coefficients. Using Hodge theory, show that $h^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})$, the dimension of $H^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})$, can be expressed in terms of $g$ and $d$ as\n$$h^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})=\\frac{1}{2}(d-1)(d-2)g.$$ \n\nFor example, if $C$ is a smooth degree $d$ plane curve, then $g=\\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$ and so $h^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})=\\frac{1}{2}(d-1)(d-2)^2$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Hodge decomposition theorem, which states that for a smooth projective variety $X$, the singular cohomology group $H^k(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ can be decomposed as a direct sum of Hodge subgroups $H^{p,q}(X)$, where $p+q=k$. In our case, we have a smooth projective curve $C$, so we are interested in the first singular cohomology group $H^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})$. According to the Hodge decomposition theorem, we have:\n\n$$H^1(C,\\mathbb{Z}) = H^{1,0}(C) \\oplus H^{0,1}(C).$$\n\nNow, we know that the dimension of $H^{1,0}(C)$ is equal to the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. This is because the space $H^{1,0}(C)$ corresponds to the space of holomorphic 1-forms on $C$, and the dimension of this space is equal to the genus $g$ by the Riemann-Roch theorem. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\dim H^{1,0}(C) = g.$$\n\nSince $C$ is a smooth projective curve, it is also a complex manifold, and by the complex conjugation, we have:\n\n$$\\dim H^{0,1}(C) = \\dim H^{1,0}(C) = g.$$\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of $H^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})$ as the sum of the dimensions of $H^{1,0}(C)$ and $H^{0,1}(C)$:\n\n$$h^1(C,\\mathbb{Z}) = \\dim H^1(C,\\mathbb{Z}) = \\dim H^{1,0}(C) + \\dim H^{0,1}(C) = g + g = 2g.$$\n\nNow, we need to express $h^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of $g$ and $d$. Recall that for a smooth degree $d$ plane curve, we have:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}.$$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$$2g = (d-1)(d-2).$$\n\nFinally, we can express $h^1(C,\\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of $g$ and $d$ as:\n\n$$h^1(C,\\mathbb{Z}) = 2g = \\frac{1}{2}(d-1)(d-2)g.$$"
