    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two types of products, X and Y, which generate a profit of $4 and $6 per unit, respectively. The company has limited resources, so a maximum of 20,000 units of each product can be produced. The total production cost for X and Y is $3 and $4 per unit, respectively. The company wants to maximize its profit. Using simulated annealing method, find the optimal production quantities for X and Y that maximize the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform the simulated annealing method directly. However, I can provide you with an outline of the steps you would need to take to solve this problem using the simulated annealing method.\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function represents the profit the company makes. In this case, it is given by:\n\nProfit = 4 * X + 6 * Y - 3 * X - 4 * Y = X + 2 * Y\n\nwhere X and Y are the production quantities of products X and Y, respectively.\n\n2. Define the constraints: The constraints are the limitations on the production quantities of X and Y:\n\n0 <= X <= 20,000\n0 <= Y <= 20,000\n\n3. Initialize the simulated annealing parameters: Choose an initial temperature T, a cooling rate α, and a stopping criterion (e.g., a minimum temperature or a maximum number of iterations).\n\n4. Generate an initial solution: Randomly select an initial production quantity for X and Y within the constraints.\n\n5. Repeat the following steps until the stopping criterion is met:\n\n  a. Generate a neighboring solution: Slightly modify the current solution (e.g., by adding or subtracting a small random value to the production quantities of X and Y) while ensuring that the new solution still satisfies the constraints.\n  \n  b. Calculate the change in the objective function: ΔE = E(new solution) - E(current solution), where E is the profit.\n  \n  c. If ΔE > 0, accept the new solution. If ΔE < 0, accept the new solution with a probability of exp(ΔE / T).\n  \n  d. Update the temperature: T = α * T\n\n6. The final solution will be the production quantities of X and Y that maximize the company's profit.\n\nTo actually perform the simulated annealing method, you would need to implement these steps in a programming language like Python or MATLAB."
