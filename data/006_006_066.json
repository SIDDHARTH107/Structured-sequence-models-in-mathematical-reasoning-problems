    "message_1": "A basketball player has a free throw percentage of 85%. If she takes 10 free throws, what is the probability that she makes all 10 shots?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the basketball player makes all 10 shots, we simply multiply the probability of making each individual shot together. Since her free throw percentage is 85%, the probability of making a single shot is 0.85.\n\nProbability of making all 10 shots = (0.85)^10 = 0.1968744043407226\n\nSo, the probability that she makes all 10 shots is approximately 19.69%."
