    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of the vector field $X$ with respect to the vector field $Y$, we use the Lie bracket $[Y, X]$. The Lie bracket is defined as:\n\n$$[Y, X] = Y(X) - X(Y)$$\n\nwhere $Y(X)$ and $X(Y)$ are the action of the vector fields $Y$ and $X$ on each other. In our case, we have:\n\n$$Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad X = x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$$\n\nNow, we compute the action of $Y$ on $X$:\n\n$$Y(X) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\n\nSince $X$ and $Y$ have no $z$ components, their derivatives with respect to $z$ are zero.\n\nNext, we compute the action of $X$ on $Y$:\n\n$$X(Y) = \\left(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) - y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\n\nAgain, since $X$ and $Y$ have no $z$ components, their derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are zero.\n\nNow, we compute the Lie bracket $[Y, X] = Y(X) - X(Y) = 0 - 0 = 0$. Therefore, the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to $Y$ at the point $(1,1,1)$ on $M$ is:\n\n$$[Y, X](1,1,1) = 0$$"
