    "message_2": "First, let's count the number of vowels and consonants in the word \"MATHEMATICS\". There are 4 vowels (A, A, E, I) and 7 consonants (M, M, T, T, H, C, S).\n\nWe can arrange the vowels and consonants in two groups: VVVV and CCCCCCC. The vowels can be arranged in 4!/(2!) ways, as there are two A's. The consonants can be arranged in 7!/(2! * 2!) ways, as there are two M's and two T's.\n\nNow, we can arrange these two groups in two ways: either the vowels come first (VVVVCCCCCC) or the consonants come first (CCCCCCCVVVV).\n\nSo, the total number of unique arrangements is:\n\n(4!/(2!)) * (7!/(2! * 2!)) * 2 = (12) * (2520) * 2 = 30240 unique arrangements."
