    "message_2": "This statement is true. Here's the proof:\n\nLet x be an odd integer. By definition, an odd integer can be written in the form x = 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, let's consider the square of x:\n\nx^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = (2k + 1)(2k + 1) = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n\nNotice that both 4k^2 and 4k are even integers, as they are multiples of 2. The sum of two even integers is also even, so:\n\n4k^2 + 4k = 2(2k^2 + 2k) is even.\n\nNow, the sum of an even integer and an odd integer is odd. Therefore:\n\nx^2 = (4k^2 + 4k) + 1 is odd.\n\nSo, for all integers x, if x is odd, then x^2 is odd."
