    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 for x in the interval [0, 2π), follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(x):\n2sin(x) = -1\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\n2. Find the angles x in the interval [0, 2π) that have a sine of -1/2:\nSince sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we need to find the reference angle in those quadrants.\n\nThe reference angle for sin(x) = 1/2 is π/6 (or 30°). So, the angles in the third and fourth quadrants with the same reference angle are:\n\nx1 = π + π/6 = 7π/6\nx2 = 2π - π/6 = 11π/6\n\n3. Check the solutions:\nsin(7π/6) = -1/2\nsin(11π/6) = -1/2\n\nBoth solutions are valid. Therefore, the solutions for the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π) are:\n\nx = 7π/6, 11π/6"
