    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5, we need to apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5 is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(8x)/dx + d(5)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3(2x^(2-1)) - 8(1x^(1-1)) + 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0)\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 8\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 8\n\nf'(2) = 12 - 8\n\nf'(2) = 4\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5 at x = 2 is 4."
