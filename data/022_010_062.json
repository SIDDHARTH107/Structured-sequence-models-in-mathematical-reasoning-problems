    "message_2": "To find the coefficients of the Laurent series expansion of the given function, we first rewrite the function in terms of $w = z - 1$. Then, we can use partial fraction decomposition to simplify the expression and find the coefficients.\n\nLet $w = z - 1$, so $z = w + 1$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{w + 2}{(w + 1)^2 - 2(w + 1)} = \\frac{w + 2}{w^2}$$\n\nNow, we can use partial fraction decomposition to rewrite the function as:\n\n$$\\frac{w + 2}{w^2} = \\frac{A}{w} + \\frac{B}{w^2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $w^2$ gives:\n\n$$w + 2 = A w + B$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of $w$, we get:\n\n$$A = 1$$\n$$B = 2$$\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{w} + \\frac{2}{w^2}$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function in terms of $z$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z - 1} + \\frac{2}{(z - 1)^2}$$\n\nThus, the coefficients of the Laurent series expansion are:\n\n$$a_{-1} = 1$$\n$$a_{-2} = 2$$\n\nAnd all other coefficients are zero. The Laurent series expansion of the function is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z - 1} + \\frac{2}{(z - 1)^2}$$"
