    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of their union. The complement of a set is the set of elements that are not in the given set. Assuming the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n(A ∪ B)' = U - (A ∪ B) = { }\n\nThe complement of the union of A and B is the empty set, as all elements in the universal set are in the union of A and B.\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the complement of their union. The distributive property states that:\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C)\n\nLet's test this property with A ∆ B and (A ∪ B)':\n\nA ∆ (A ∪ B)' = A ∆ { } = A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\n(A ∆ A) ∪ (A ∆ B') = { } ∪ {1, 2, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nSince A ∆ (A ∪ B)' ≠ (A ∆ A) ∪ (A ∆ B'), the symmetric difference of A and B is not distributive over the complement of their union."
