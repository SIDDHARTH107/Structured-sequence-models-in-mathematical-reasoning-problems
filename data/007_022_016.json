    "message_2": "To compute the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve E(Z/13Z), we will use the following method:\n\n1. Initialize a counter variable N to 1, which accounts for the point at infinity.\n2. Iterate through all possible x-coordinates (0 to 12) modulo 13.\n3. For each x-coordinate, compute the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 - 7x + 10) modulo 13.\n4. Check if the result is a quadratic residue modulo 13, i.e., if there exists a y-coordinate such that y^2 is congruent to the result modulo 13.\n5. If it is a quadratic residue, increment the counter N by 2 (since there are two possible y-coordinates for each x-coordinate).\n6. After iterating through all x-coordinates, the counter N will represent the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve E(Z/13Z).\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. N = 1\n2. Iterate through x = 0 to 12 modulo 13:\n\nFor x = 0:\n3. RHS = (0^3 - 7*0 + 10) % 13 = 10\n4. 10 is a quadratic residue modulo 13 (5^2 = 25 ≡ 10 (mod 13)), so increment N by 2.\n5. N = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nFor x = 1:\n3. RHS = (1^3 - 7*1 + 10) % 13 = 4\n4. 4 is a quadratic residue modulo 13 (2^2 = 4 ≡ 4 (mod 13)), so increment N by 2.\n5. N = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nFor x = 2:\n3. RHS = (2^3 - 7*2 + 10) % 13 = 1\n4. 1 is a quadratic residue modulo 13 (1^2 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 13)), so increment N by 2.\n5. N = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nFor x = 3:\n3. RHS = (3^3 - 7*3 + 10) % 13 = 12\n4. 12 is not a quadratic residue modulo 13, so do not increment N.\n\nFor x = 4:\n3. RHS = (4^3 - 7*4 + 10) % 13 = 5\n4. 5 is not a quadratic residue modulo 13, so do not increment N.\n\nFor x = 5:\n3. RHS = (5^3 - 7*5 + 10) % 13 = 0\n4. 0 is a quadratic residue modulo 13 (0^2 = 0 ≡ 0 (mod 13)), so increment N by 2.\n5. N = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nFor x = 6 to 12, none of the RHS values are quadratic residues modulo 13, so N remains unchanged.\n\n6. The order of the group of points on the elliptic curve E(Z/13Z) is N = 9."
