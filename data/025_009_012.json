Let $\\omega_{i}$ denote the $i$-th normalized holomorphic differential form on a curve in $\\mathcal{M}_{3}$.\n\nThe problem is: Compute the value of the intersection number $<\\omega_{1}^{2}, \\omega_{3}>$ in $\\mathcal{M}_{3}$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number $<\\omega_{1}^{2}, \\omega_{3}>$ in $\\mathcal{M}_{3}$, we will use the Mumford-Morita-Miller (MMM) classes and their intersection properties. The MMM classes are denoted by $\\kappa_i$, where $i$ is a non-negative integer. They are cohomology classes on the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_{g}$ of smooth algebraic curves of genus $g$.\n\nThe intersection numbers of the form $<\\omega_{1}^{2}, \\omega_{3}>$ can be expressed in terms of the MMM classes using the following formula:\n\n$$<\\omega_{1}^{2}, \\omega_{3}> = \\frac{1}{(2-1)!(3-1)!} \\int_{\\mathcal{M}_{3}} \\kappa_1^2 \\kappa_2.$$\n\nNow, we will use the known intersection numbers of the MMM classes in $\\mathcal{M}_{3}$. The only non-zero intersection numbers in $\\mathcal{M}_{3}$ are:\n\n$$\\int_{\\mathcal{M}_{3}} \\kappa_1^3 = 24, \\quad \\int_{\\mathcal{M}_{3}} \\kappa_1 \\kappa_2 = 12.$$\n\nSince $\\kappa_1^2 \\kappa_2$ does not match any of the non-zero intersection numbers listed above, we conclude that the intersection number $<\\omega_{1}^{2}, \\omega_{3}>$ is zero:\n\n$$<\\omega_{1}^{2}, \\omega_{3}> = \\frac{1}{(2-1)!(3-1)!} \\int_{\\mathcal{M}_{3}} \\kappa_1^2 \\kappa_2 = 0.$$"
