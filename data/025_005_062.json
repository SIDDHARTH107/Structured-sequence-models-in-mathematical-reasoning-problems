    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the function f(x, y, z) with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x + yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 + xz\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2 + xy\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n2x + yz = 0\n3y^2 + xz = 0\n3z^2 + xy = 0\n\nLet's analyze the system of equations:\n\n1. If x = 0, then from the first equation, we get yz = 0. So, either y = 0 or z = 0.\n   a) If y = 0, then from the second equation, xz = 0. Since x = 0, z can be any value.\n   b) If z = 0, then from the third equation, xy = 0. Since x = 0, y can be any value.\n   So, the points (0, y, 0) and (0, 0, z) are singular points for any values of y and z.\n\n2. If x ≠ 0, then we can divide the second equation by x and the third equation by y:\n\n   3y^2/x + z = 0\n   3z^2/y + x = 0\n\n   Now, multiply the first equation by y and the second equation by z:\n\n   3y^3 + xyz = 0\n   3z^3 + xyz = 0\n\n   Subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n   3z^3 - 3y^3 = 0\n   3(z^3 - y^3) = 0\n   z^3 = y^3\n\n   Since z^3 = y^3, we have z = y or z = -y. However, from the first equation, 2x + yz = 0, if z = -y, then 2x = 0, which contradicts our assumption that x ≠ 0. Therefore, z = y.\n\n   Now, substitute z = y in the second equation:\n\n   3y^2 + xy = 0\n   y(3y + x) = 0\n\n   So, either y = 0 or 3y + x = 0. But we already analyzed the case y = 0 in step 1. So, let's consider 3y + x = 0:\n\n   x = -3y\n\n   Substitute x = -3y in the first equation:\n\n   2(-3y) + y^2 = 0\n   -6y + y^2 = 0\n   y(y - 6) = 0\n\n   So, either y = 0 or y = 6. But we already analyzed the case y = 0 in step 1. So, let's consider y = 6:\n\n   x = -3y = -18\n   z = y = 6\n\n   So, the point (-18, 6, 6) is a singular point.\n\nIn conclusion, the singular points of the algebraic variety V are (0, y, 0), (0, 0, z), and (-18, 6, 6) for any values of y and z."
