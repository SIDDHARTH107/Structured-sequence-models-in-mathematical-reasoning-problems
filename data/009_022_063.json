Suppose that the substance diffuses through a one-dimensional space with $x\\in[0,1]$. The initial concentration is given as $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n\nFind the concentration of the substance at $t=0.05$ if $D=0.1$ and $f(u)=u(1-u)(u-0.1)$. Use a numerical method of your choice to solve this problem. Use a spatial resolution of $N=100$ (i.e., divide the space into 100 equal intervals) and set the time step to $\\Delta t = 0.001$.",
    "message_2": "We will use the finite difference method to solve this problem. First, we discretize the spatial domain into $N=100$ intervals with $\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{N}$. Let $u_i^n$ denote the concentration at the $i$-th spatial point and the $n$-th time step. We can approximate the second derivative with respect to $x$ using the central difference formula:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}.$$\n\nNext, we approximate the time derivative using the forward difference formula:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t}.$$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the reaction-diffusion equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t} = D\\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} + f(u_i^n).$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $u_i^{n+1}$:\n\n$$u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + \\Delta t \\left(D\\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} + f(u_i^n)\\right).$$\n\nWe can use this formula to update the concentration at each time step. The initial condition is given as $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, so we have $u_i^0 = \\sin(\\pi i\\Delta x)$ for $i=0,1,\\dots,N$. We will iterate this process for $n=0,1,\\dots,50$ to reach $t=0.05$.\n\nHere is a Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nN = 100\ndx = 1 / N\ndt = 0.001\nD = 0.1\nt_final = 0.05\n\ndef f(u):\n    return u * (1 - u) * (u - 0.1)\n\n# Initialize the concentration array\nu = np.array([np.sin(np.pi * i * dx) for i in range(N+1)])\n\n# Time-stepping loop\nt = 0\nwhile t < t_final:\n    u_new = np.zeros(N+1)\n    for i in range(1, N):\n        u_new[i] = u[i] + dt * (D * (u[i+1] - 2*u[i] + u[i-1]) / dx**2 + f(u[i]))\n    u = u_new\n    t += dt\n\nprint(u)\n```\n\nThe resulting `u` array contains the concentration of the substance at each spatial point at $t=0.05$."
