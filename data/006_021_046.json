    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next 5 years, we can first find the probability of no tornadoes occurring in the next 5 years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no tornado occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor 5 years, the probability of no tornadoes occurring in all 5 years is (0.95)^5 = 0.774.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next 5 years:\n\n1 - 0.774 = 0.226.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next 5 years is 0.226 or 22.6%."
