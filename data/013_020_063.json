    "message_1": "In a Beauty Contest Game where players must choose a number between 0 and 100, the winning number is defined as the number that is closest to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. If there are 10 players and the already chosen numbers are 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, what number should the last player choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the average of the already chosen numbers:\n\n(20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 70 + 80 + 90) / 8 = 440 / 8 = 55\n\nNow, let's assume the last player chooses the number x. The average of all chosen numbers will then be:\n\n(440 + x) / 9\n\nThe winning number will be 2/3 of this average:\n\n(2/3) * ((440 + x) / 9)\n\nTo maximize their chances of winning, the last player should choose a number closest to this value. To find the optimal value of x, we can set up an equation:\n\nx = (2/3) * ((440 + x) / 9)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 9 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n9x = 2(440 + x)\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n9x = 880 + 2x\n7x = 880\nx â‰ˆ 125.71\n\nHowever, since the player can only choose a number between 0 and 100, they should choose the closest possible number within this range. In this case, the last player should choose 100 to maximize their chances of winning."
