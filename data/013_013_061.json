    "message_1": "In a sealed-bid second price auction for a painting, there are three bidders A, B, and C. The true valuations they have for the painting are $100, $120 and $150, respectively. What would be the winning bid and the profit of the winning bidder if the auction follows the second-price rule?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price. In this case, bidder C has the highest valuation at $150, followed by bidder B at $120, and bidder A at $100.\n\nSince bidder C has the highest bid, they would win the auction. They would pay the second-highest bid, which is $120 (bidder B's valuation). The winning bid would be $120.\n\nTo calculate the profit of the winning bidder (bidder C), we subtract the winning bid from their true valuation:\n\nProfit = True Valuation - Winning Bid\nProfit = $150 - $120\nProfit = $30\n\nSo, the profit of the winning bidder (bidder C) would be $30."
