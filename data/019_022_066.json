    "message_1": "A math student is trying to decide whether to enroll in a statistics course or a calculus course for the upcoming semester. The statistics course costs $700 and will require 80 hours of studying outside of class, while the calculus course costs $1000 and will require 120 hours of studying outside of class. Additionally, the math student's expected grade in the statistics course is an A-, while their expected grade in the calculus course is a B+. Using decision theory, what course should the student choose if their goal is to maximize their expected outcome?",
    "message_2": "To use decision theory, we need to assign values to the different aspects of each course and calculate the expected utility for each course. Let's assign the following values:\n\n- A- grade: 90 points\n- B+ grade: 87 points\n- Cost: -$1 per dollar spent\n- Study time: -1 point per hour of studying\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected utility for each course:\n\nStatistics course:\nUtility = (90 points for A- grade) + (-$700 for cost) + (-80 points for study time)\nUtility = 90 - 700 - 80 = -690\n\nCalculus course:\nUtility = (87 points for B+ grade) + (-$1000 for cost) + (-120 points for study time)\nUtility = 87 - 1000 - 120 = -1033\n\nSince the statistics course has a higher expected utility (-690) compared to the calculus course (-1033), the student should choose the statistics course to maximize their expected outcome."
