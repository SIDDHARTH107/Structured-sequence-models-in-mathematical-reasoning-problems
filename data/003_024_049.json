    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector a onto vector b, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection of a onto b = (a · b) / ||b||\n\nwhere a · b is the dot product of the two vectors and ||b|| is the magnitude of vector b.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\na · b = (3 * 6) + (4 * -2) = 18 - 8 = 10\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector b:\n\n||b|| = √(6^2 + (-2)^2) = √(36 + 4) = √40\n\nNow, we can find the projection of a onto b:\n\nprojection of a onto b = (a · b) / ||b|| = 10 / √40\n\nTo find the magnitude of the projection, we can simplify the expression:\n\nmagnitude = 10 / √40 = 10 / (2 * √10) = 5 / √10\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √10:\n\nmagnitude = (5 * √10) / (10) = √10 / 2\n\nSo, the magnitude of the projection of vector a onto vector b is √10 / 2."
