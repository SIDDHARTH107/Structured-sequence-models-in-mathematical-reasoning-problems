Then, determine the behavior of the solutions around each critical point using phase portraits.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the system, we need to set both dx/dt and dy/dt equal to zero and solve for x and y.\n\ndx/dt = -y - x^3 = 0\ndy/dt = x - y^3 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\ny = -x^3\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\nx - (-x^3)^3 = x - x^9 = 0\n\nFactor out x:\nx(1 - x^8) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\nx = 0 or x = 1\n\nFor x = 0, we have y = -x^3 = 0.\nFor x = 1, we have y = -x^3 = -1.\n\nSo, the critical points are (0, 0) and (1, -1).\n\nNow, we need to linearize the system around each critical point. To do this, we find the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂(dx/dt)/∂x  ∂(dx/dt)/∂y |\n          | ∂(dy/dt)/∂x  ∂(dy/dt)/∂y |\n\nJ(x, y) = | -3x^2  -1 |\n          |   1    -3y^2 |\n\nNow, we evaluate the Jacobian at each critical point:\n\nJ(0, 0) = |  0  -1 |\n          |  1   0 |\n\nJ(1, -1) = | -3  -1 |\n           |  1  -3 |\n\nNext, we find the eigenvalues of each Jacobian matrix to determine the stability of the critical points.\n\nFor J(0, 0), the characteristic equation is:\nλ^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis has complex eigenvalues λ = ±i, which means the critical point (0, 0) is a center.\n\nFor J(1, -1), the characteristic equation is:\n(λ + 3)(λ + 3) - 1 = λ^2 + 6λ + 8 = 0\n\nThis has real eigenvalues λ = -2 and λ = -4, which means the critical point (1, -1) is a stable node.\n\nNow, we can sketch the phase portraits around each critical point.\n\nAround the critical point (0, 0), the solutions will form closed orbits, as it is a center. This means the solutions will neither converge nor diverge from the critical point, but instead oscillate around it.\n\nAround the critical point (1, -1), the solutions will converge to the critical point, as it is a stable node. This means the solutions will approach the critical point as time goes to infinity."
