    "message_1": "In a certain market, 60% of the consumers purchase product A, 30% purchase product B, and 10% purchase both products. What is the probability that a randomly chosen consumer from this market will only purchase product A?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen consumer will only purchase product A, we can use the formula:\n\nP(A only) = P(A) - P(A and B)\n\nwhere P(A) is the probability of purchasing product A, P(B) is the probability of purchasing product B, and P(A and B) is the probability of purchasing both products.\n\nWe are given that P(A) = 60%, P(B) = 30%, and P(A and B) = 10%.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A only) = 60% - 10% = 50%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen consumer will only purchase product A is 50%."
