    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that grows with each iteration. The total length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (initial side length) * (scaling factor)^n\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the scaling factor is 3^(3/2), or approximately 2.598.\n\nSo, to find the total length of the Gosper curve after 6 iterations with an initial side length of 1 unit, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2.598)^6\nLength ≈ 1 * 1075.65\nLength ≈ 1075.65 units\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Gosper curve after 6 iterations with an initial side length of 1 unit is approximately 1075.65 units."
