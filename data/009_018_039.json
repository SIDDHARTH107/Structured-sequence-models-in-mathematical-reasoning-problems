    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we'll first define the function f(x, y) = x + y^2. Then, we'll use the following formulas for the Runge-Kutta method:\n\nk1 = h * f(x_n, y_n)\nk2 = h * f(x_n + h/2, y_n + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(x_n + h/2, y_n + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(x_n + h, y_n + k3)\ny_{n+1} = y_n + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6\n\nHere, h is the step size, x_n and y_n are the current values of x and y, and y_{n+1} is the updated value of y. We'll start with the initial condition y(0) = 1 and iterate until x = 2. Since we want the result to be accurate within 0.01, we'll choose a step size of h = 0.01.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\nInitial condition: x_0 = 0, y_0 = 1\n\nIteration 1:\nk1 = 0.01 * f(0, 1) = 0.01 * (0 + 1) = 0.01\nk2 = 0.01 * f(0.005, 1.005) = 0.01 * (0.005 + 1.005^2) ≈ 0.010105\nk3 = 0.01 * f(0.005, 1.005025) = 0.01 * (0.005 + 1.005025^2) ≈ 0.010105\nk4 = 0.01 * f(0.01, 1.01021) = 0.01 * (0.01 + 1.01021^2) ≈ 0.020420\ny_1 = 1 + (0.01 + 2*0.010105 + 2*0.010105 + 0.020420)/6 ≈ 1.010105\n\nIteration 2:\nk1 = 0.01 * f(0.01, 1.010105) = 0.01 * (0.01 + 1.010105^2) ≈ 0.020420\nk2 = 0.01 * f(0.015, 1.020315) = 0.01 * (0.015 + 1.020315^2) ≈ 0.030735\nk3 = 0.01 * f(0.015, 1.020325) = 0.01 * (0.015 + 1.020325^2) ≈ 0.030745\nk4 = 0.01 * f(0.02, 1.03063) = 0.01 * (0.02 + 1.03063^2) ≈ 0.041060\ny_2 = 1.010105 + (0.020420 + 2*0.030735 + 2*0.030745 + 0.041060)/6 ≈ 1.020315\n\nContinue iterating in this manner until x = 2 (i.e., 200 iterations). After completing the 200 iterations, we get:\n\ny(2) ≈ 5.30651\n\nSo, the value of y at x = 2 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, accurate to within 0.01, is approximately 5.30651."
