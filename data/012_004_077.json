They have calculated the distances between each pair of buildings and created a weighted graph. Find the minimum spanning tree for the following distances:\n\n- Building 1 to 2: 5 km\n- Building 1 to 3: 3 km\n- Building 1 to 4: 6 km\n- Building 1 to 5: 2 km\n- Building 1 to 6: 8 km\n- Building 1 to 7: 9 km\n- Building 2 to 3: 4 km\n- Building 2 to 4: 3 km\n- Building 2 to 5: 3 km\n- Building 2 to 6: 7 km\n- Building 2 to 7: 2 km\n- Building 3 to 4: 1 km\n- Building 3 to 5: 5 km\n- Building 3 to 6: 4 km\n- Building 3 to 7: 5 km\n- Building 4 to 5: 5 km\n- Building 4 to 6: 2 km\n- Building 4 to 7: 1 km\n- Building 5 to 6: 6 km\n- Building 5 to 7: 3 km\n- Building 6 to 7: 3 km\n\nWhat is the total length of the minimum spanning tree and which buildings are connected?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. Building 3 to 4: 1 km\n2. Building 4 to 7: 1 km\n3. Building 1 to 5: 2 km\n4. Building 4 to 6: 2 km\n5. Building 2 to 7: 2 km\n6. Building 1 to 3: 3 km\n7. Building 2 to 4: 3 km\n8. Building 2 to 5: 3 km\n9. Building 5 to 7: 3 km\n10. Building 6 to 7: 3 km\n11. Building 3 to 6: 4 km\n12. Building 2 to 3: 4 km\n13. Building 1 to 2: 5 km\n14. Building 3 to 7: 5 km\n15. Building 3 to 5: 5 km\n16. Building 4 to 5: 5 km\n17. Building 1 to 4: 6 km\n18. Building 5 to 6: 6 km\n19. Building 2 to 6: 7 km\n20. Building 1 to 6: 8 km\n21. Building 1 to 7: 9 km\n\nNow, we add edges to the minimum spanning tree while ensuring that no cycles are formed:\n\n1. Add edge Building 3 to 4 (1 km)\n2. Add edge Building 4 to 7 (1 km)\n3. Add edge Building 1 to 5 (2 km)\n4. Add edge Building 4 to 6 (2 km)\n5. Add edge Building 2 to 7 (2 km)\n6. Add edge Building 1 to 3 (3 km) - Adding this edge will not form a cycle.\n7. Add edge Building 2 to 4 (3 km) - Adding this edge will form a cycle, so we skip it.\n8. Add edge Building 2 to 5 (3 km) - Adding this edge will not form a cycle.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete, and the connections are as follows:\n\n- Building 1 to 3: 3 km\n- Building 1 to 5: 2 km\n- Building 2 to 5: 3 km\n- Building 2 to 7: 2 km\n- Building 3 to 4: 1 km\n- Building 4 to 6: 2 km\n- Building 4 to 7: 1 km\n\nThe total length of the minimum spanning tree is 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 14 km."
