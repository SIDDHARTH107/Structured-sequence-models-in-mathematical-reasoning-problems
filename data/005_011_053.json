    "message_1": "A company wants to test the effectiveness of a new energy drink in increasing focus and concentration. They recruit 100 participants and randomly assign 50 to drink the new energy drink and 50 to drink a placebo. After 1 hour, each participant takes a concentration test, and the scores are recorded. The average concentration score for the energy drink group is 85 with a standard deviation of 10, while the average concentration score for the placebo group is 75 with a standard deviation of 8. \n\nThe question for the math student to solve is: Based on this data, is there a significant difference in concentration scores between the energy drink group and the placebo group? Conduct a hypothesis test at a 5% significance level.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in concentration scores between the energy drink group and the placebo group, we will conduct a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference between the two groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant difference between the two groups.\n\nH0: μ1 - μ2 = 0\nH1: μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0\n\nHere, μ1 is the mean concentration score for the energy drink group, and μ2 is the mean concentration score for the placebo group.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the difference between the two sample means:\n\nSE = sqrt[(s1^2 / n1) + (s2^2 / n2)]\n\nwhere s1 and s2 are the standard deviations of the two groups, and n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the two groups.\n\nSE = sqrt[(10^2 / 50) + (8^2 / 50)] = sqrt[(100 / 50) + (64 / 50)] = sqrt[2 + 1.28] = sqrt[3.28] ≈ 1.81\n\nNext, we calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (M1 - M2) / SE\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the sample means of the two groups.\n\nt = (85 - 75) / 1.81 ≈ 5.52\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a 5% significance level (α = 0.05) and degrees of freedom (df) equal to the smaller of n1 - 1 and n2 - 1:\n\ndf = min(50 - 1, 50 - 1) = 49\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value for α = 0.05 and df = 49:\n\nt_critical ≈ ± 2.01\n\nSince our calculated t-score (5.52) is greater than the critical t-value (2.01), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a significant difference in concentration scores between the energy drink group and the placebo group at a 5% significance level."
