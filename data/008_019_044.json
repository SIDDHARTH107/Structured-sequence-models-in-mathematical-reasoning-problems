    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation, and subtract the first equation from the third equation:\n\n(2x + 3y - 4z) - (x - 5y + 3z) = -5 - 1\nx + 8y - 7z = -6  (1)\n\n(x + 2y + (2+i)z) - (x - 5y + 3z) = (3-i) - 1\n7y - (1-i)z = 2-i  (2)\n\nNow we have a new system of linear equations with two equations and two unknowns (y and z):\n\nx + 8y - 7z = -6\n7y - (1-i)z = 2-i\n\nNext, we can eliminate y from these two equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 8 and subtract the first equation:\n\n8(7y - (1-i)z) - (x + 8y - 7z) = 8(2-i) - (-6)\n56y - 8(1-i)z - x - 8y + 7z = 16 - 8i + 6\n48y - 8(1-i)z + 7z = 22 - 8i\n\nNow, let's isolate z in this equation:\n\n48y - 8z + 8iz + 7z = 22 - 8i\n48y - z + 8iz = 22 - 8i\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for z back into equation (2):\n\n7y - (1-i)(-z + 8iz) = 2-i\n7y + z - 8iz - (1-i)z + 8i(1-i)z = 2-i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n7y + (1-8i)z = 2-i\n\nNow we can solve for y:\n\ny = (2-i - (1-8i)z) / 7\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y back into the equation for z:\n\n48((2-i - (1-8i)z) / 7) - z + 8iz = 22 - 8i\n\nNow we can solve for z:\n\nz = (6 - 8i) / 15\n\nNow we can substitute this value of z back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (2-i - (1-8i)((6 - 8i) / 15)) / 7\ny = (2-i - (6 - 8i + 48i - 64) / 15) / 7\ny = (2-i - (-58 + 56i) / 15) / 7\ny = (2-i + (58 - 56i) / 15) / 7\ny = (32 - 50i) / 105\n\nNow we can substitute the values of y and z back into the equation for x:\n\nx - 5((32 - 50i) / 105) + 3((6 - 8i) / 15) = 1\nx = 1 + 5((32 - 50i) / 105) - 3((6 - 8i) / 15)\nx = (1 + (160 - 250i) / 105 - (18 - 24i) / 15)\nx = (105 + 160 - 250i - 18 + 24i) / 105\nx = (247 - 226i) / 105\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = (247 - 226i) / 105\ny = (32 - 50i) / 105\nz = (6 - 8i) / 15"
