    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people affected by the disease, we can multiply the probability of being affected by the total number of people in the group.\n\nExpected number of affected people = Probability × Total number of people\n= 0.35 × 200\n= 70\n\nSo, 70 people are expected to be affected by the disease in that demographic group."
