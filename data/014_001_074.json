    "message_2": "To find the private decryption key d, we first need to compute the modulus n and the totient of n (denoted as φ(n)).\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\nn = 23 * 41 = 943\n\n2. Compute φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nφ(n) = (23-1) * (41-1) = 22 * 40 = 880\n\n3. Find the decryption key d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1\nIn this case, e = 17 and φ(n) = 880. We need to find the modular inverse of e (17) with respect to φ(n) (880).\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular inverse:\n\nExtended Euclidean Algorithm:\nfunction inverse(a, m) {\n    if (gcd(a, m) != 1) {\n        return -1; // a and m are not coprime\n    }\n    else {\n        return (a^(m-2)) % m;\n    }\n}\n\nApplying the function to our values:\ninverse(17, 880) = (17^(880-2)) % 880 = (17^878) % 880 = 593\n\nSo, the private decryption key d is 593."
