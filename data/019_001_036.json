    "message_2": "To find the truth value of the compound proposition ~(p v q), we first need to determine the truth values of p and q.\n\np: \"7 is greater than 5\" - This statement is true.\nq: \"4 is less than 9\" - This statement is also true.\n\nNow, let's find the truth value of the disjunction (p v q):\n\np v q: True v True = True\n\nFinally, let's find the truth value of the negation of (p v q):\n\n~(p v q): ~True = False\n\nSo, the truth value of the compound proposition ~(p v q) is False."
