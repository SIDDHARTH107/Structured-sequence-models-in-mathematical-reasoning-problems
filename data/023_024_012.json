    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x) = |sin(x)|, we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n in the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nSince f(x) is an even function (f(-x) = f(x)), all the sine terms will be zero, and we only need to find the a_n coefficients. The formulas for a_0 and a_n are:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[|sin(x)|]dx from -π to π\n\nSince |sin(x)| is symmetric about the y-axis, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[sin(x)]dx from 0 to π\n\na_0 = (2/π) * [-cos(x)] from 0 to π\na_0 = (2/π) * (1 - (-1))\na_0 = 4/π\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[|sin(x)| * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nAgain, since |sin(x)| is symmetric about the y-axis, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[sin(x) * cos(n * x)]dx from 0 to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the product-to-sum identity:\n\nsin(x) * cos(n * x) = (1/2) * [sin((n - 1) * x) - sin((n + 1) * x)]\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[sin((n - 1) * x) - sin((n + 1) * x)]dx from 0 to π\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/(n - 1)) * cos((n - 1) * x) - (1/(n + 1)) * cos((n + 1) * x)] from 0 to π\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/(n - 1)) * (cos(n * π - π) - cos(0)) - (1/(n + 1)) * (cos(n * π + π) - cos(0))]\n\nFor odd n, cos(n * π) = -1, and for even n, cos(n * π) = 1. Since we're only interested in the odd n values (because a_n = 0 for even n), we can write:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/(n - 1)) * (2) - (1/(n + 1)) * (-2)] for odd n\na_n = (4/π) * [(1/(n - 1)) + (1/(n + 1))] for odd n\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) = |sin(x)| for -π ≤ x ≤ π is:\n\nf(x) = (4/π) * [1 + Σ[((1/(n - 1)) + (1/(n + 1))) * cos(n * x)] for odd n"
