    "message_2": "To find the genus of a graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nWe are given that |V(G)| = 6 and |E(G)| = 10. Since the degree of each vertex is 3, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nÎ£(deg(v)) = 2|E(G)|\n\nIn this case, since each vertex has degree 3, we have:\n\n6 * 3 = 2 * 10\n18 = 20\n\nHowever, this equation is not true, which means that the given information is inconsistent and a graph with these properties cannot exist. Therefore, we cannot find the genus of such a graph."
