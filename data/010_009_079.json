    "message_1": "A square with a side length of 5 cm is dissected into triangles using non-intersecting segments as shown in the figure. What is the minimum number of triangles required to dissect the square? \n\n(Note: The triangles must have sides which are segments of sides of the square). \n\n[Insert an image of the dissected square, if possible]",
    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot view or insert images. However, I can help you find the minimum number of triangles required to dissect a square with a side length of 5 cm.\n\nTo dissect a square into triangles, you can draw a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner. This will create two right-angled triangles. This is the minimum number of triangles required to dissect a square, as you cannot create a triangle with fewer than three sides.\n\nSo, the minimum number of triangles required to dissect a square with a side length of 5 cm is 2."
