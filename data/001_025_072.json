    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x + 13 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(13))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-4 ± √(16 - 52)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, we will have complex solutions. We can rewrite the square root of a negative number as the square root of the positive number times the imaginary unit i:\n\nx = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2\n\nx = (-4 ± 6i) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nx = -2 ± 3i\n\nSo, the complex solutions for the equation x^2 + 4x + 13 = 0 are:\n\nx = -2 + 3i and x = -2 - 3i"
