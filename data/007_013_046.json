    "message_2": "This statement is known as the Goldbach Conjecture, which is an unsolved problem in number theory. Although it has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values and found to be true, no general proof or counterexample has been discovered yet.\n\nThe conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For example:\n\n4 = 2 + 2\n6 = 3 + 3\n8 = 3 + 5\n10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5\n12 = 7 + 5\n\nAnd so on.\n\nDespite the lack of a general proof, the Goldbach Conjecture has been verified for even numbers up to 4 x 10^18, which provides strong numerical evidence for its validity. However, until a rigorous proof or counterexample is found, the conjecture remains unproven."
