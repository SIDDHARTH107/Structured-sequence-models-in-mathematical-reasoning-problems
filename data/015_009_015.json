    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent of the given system, we can use the Runge-Kutta method to numerically solve the differential equation and then estimate the Lyapunov exponent using the method of small perturbations. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\nθ'(t) = ω(t)\nω'(t) = -10ω(t) - 25sin(θ(t))\n\nNow, let's define the initial conditions:\n\nθ(0) = 0.2\nω(0) = 0\n\nNext, we will use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to numerically solve the system of differential equations. We will also introduce a small perturbation δθ(0) to the initial condition θ(0) and track its evolution over time. The Lyapunov exponent will be estimated as the average growth rate of the perturbation.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef runge_kutta_step(t, y, h, f):\n    k1 = h * f(t, y)\n    k2 = h * f(t + h/2, y + k1/2)\n    k3 = h * f(t + h/2, y + k2/2)\n    k4 = h * f(t + h, y + k3)\n    return y + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n\ndef pendulum_system(t, y):\n    theta, omega = y\n    return np.array([omega, -10*omega - 25*np.sin(theta)])\n\ndef lyapunov_exponent(time_steps, h, initial_conditions, perturbation):\n    y = initial_conditions\n    y_perturbed = initial_conditions + perturbation\n    lyapunov_sum = 0\n\n    for _ in range(time_steps):\n        y = runge_kutta_step(_, y, h, pendulum_system)\n        y_perturbed = runge_kutta_step(_, y_perturbed, h, pendulum_system)\n        perturbation_growth = np.linalg.norm(y_perturbed - y)\n        lyapunov_sum += np.log(perturbation_growth / np.linalg.norm(perturbation))\n        y_perturbed = y + perturbation * (perturbation_growth / np.linalg.norm(perturbation))\n\n    return lyapunov_sum / time_steps\n\ninitial_conditions = np.array([0.2, 0])\nperturbation = np.array([1e-6, 0])\ntime_steps = 10000\nh = 0.01\n\nlyapunov = lyapunov_exponent(time_steps, h, initial_conditions, perturbation)\nprint(\"Lyapunov exponent:\", lyapunov)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the Lyapunov exponent for the given initial conditions and a small perturbation in θ(0). The result will vary depending on the chosen time step (h), number of time steps, and the size of the perturbation. However, the Lyapunov exponent should be a good estimate of the average growth rate of the perturbation, indicating the stability of the system. If the Lyapunov exponent is positive, the system is chaotic, and if it's negative, the system is stable."
