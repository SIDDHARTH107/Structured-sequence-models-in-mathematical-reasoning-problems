    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it covers the entire 2D plane as the number of iterations approaches infinity. The length of the Peano curve increases with each iteration. \n\nFor the Peano curve, the length of the curve at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (3^n) * (Original segment length) / (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the original segment length is 1, and we want to find the length of the curve up to the 4th iteration (n = 4).\n\nLength = (3^4) * (1) / (2^4)\nLength = (81) / (16)\nLength = 5.0625\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve up to the 4th iteration is 5.0625."
