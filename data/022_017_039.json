    "message_2": "To find the constants $A$ and $B$, we will use the given initial conditions $z(0) = 3$ and $z'(0) = -1$. First, let's find the derivative of $z(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$z'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(Ae^{-t} + Be^{-5t}) = -Ae^{-t} - 5Be^{-5t}$.\n\nNow, we will use the initial conditions:\n\n1) $z(0) = 3 \\Rightarrow Ae^{-0} + Be^{-0} = A + B = 3$.\n\n2) $z'(0) = -1 \\Rightarrow -Ae^{-0} - 5Be^{-0} = -A - 5B = -1$.\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n\n$A + B = 3$\n$-A - 5B = -1$\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n\n$(-A - 5B) + (A + B) = -1 + 3$\n\n$-4B = 2$\n\nNow, divide by -4:\n\n$B = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow that we have the value of $B$, we can find the value of $A$ using the first equation:\n\n$A + (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 3$\n\n$A = 3 + \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$A = \\frac{7}{2}$\n\nSo the constants are $A = \\frac{7}{2}$ and $B = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\n$z(t) = \\frac{7}{2}e^{-t} - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-5t}$."
