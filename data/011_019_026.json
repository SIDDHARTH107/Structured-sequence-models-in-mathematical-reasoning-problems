    "message_1": "A factory production line can produce 4 different products. Each product has 3 characteristics that can have 2 different values (yes or no). Use an orthogonal array to design a set of experiments to test the production line in a way that tests all possible combinations of product and characteristics values, but uses the smallest number of tests possible. How many tests are required?",
    "message_2": "To design a set of experiments using an orthogonal array, we need to determine the appropriate array to use. In this case, we have 4 different products, each with 3 characteristics that can have 2 different values (yes or no). This means we have 4 factors (products) with 2 levels (yes or no) for each factor.\n\nAn orthogonal array is represented as L^(s^t), where L is the number of experiments, s is the number of levels, and t is the number of factors. In this case, we need an orthogonal array with 4 factors and 2 levels. The smallest orthogonal array that meets these requirements is L8(2^7), which has 8 experiments.\n\nSo, the smallest number of tests required to test all possible combinations of product and characteristics values using an orthogonal array is 8 tests."
