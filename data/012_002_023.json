    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of the graph G, we need to find the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph G, denoted as Δ(G). Since G has 9 vertices and 12 edges, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 12) / 9 ≈ 2.67. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 3. It's possible to have a vertex with a degree of 4, but not higher, as it would require more than 12 edges in the graph.\n\nNow, we can use the following theorem to find the chromatic number:\n\nTheorem: For any graph G, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn our case, Δ(G) = 4, so χ(G) ≤ 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nHowever, we can't be sure that the chromatic number is exactly 5 without more information about the graph's structure. We can only conclude that the chromatic number of the graph G is at most 5."
