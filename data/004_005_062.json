    "message_1": "Sure, how about this:\n\nA tank initially contains 100 gallons of water with 1 lb of salt dissolved in it. Salt water with a concentration of 0.05 lb/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min, while well-stirred water flows out of the tank at the same rate. Assuming that the salt is uniformly distributed throughout the water in the tank, write a differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time, and find the amount of salt in the tank after 30 minutes.",
    "message_2": "Let S(t) be the amount of salt in the tank at time t (in minutes). The rate of salt flowing into the tank is 2 gal/min * 0.05 lb/gal = 0.1 lb/min. The rate of salt flowing out of the tank is proportional to the concentration of salt in the tank, which is S(t)/100 lb/gal, and the flow rate of 2 gal/min. So, the rate of salt flowing out is (S(t)/100) * 2 lb/min.\n\nNow, we can write a differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time:\n\ndS/dt = rate of salt flowing in - rate of salt flowing out\ndS/dt = 0.1 - (S(t)/100) * 2\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫-2/100 dt) = e^(-t/50). Multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(-t/50) dS/dt - (2/100)e^(-t/50) S(t) = 0.1e^(-t/50)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product S(t)e^(-t/50). So, we can integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(d/dt[S(t)e^(-t/50)]) dt = ∫0.1e^(-t/50) dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nS(t)e^(-t/50) = -5e^(-t/50) + C\n\nNow, we can solve for the initial condition, S(0) = 1 lb:\n\n1 = -5 + C\nC = 6\n\nSo, the equation for S(t) is:\n\nS(t) = -5e^(-t/50) + 6e^(t/50)\n\nNow, we can find the amount of salt in the tank after 30 minutes:\n\nS(30) = -5e^(-30/50) + 6e^(30/50) ≈ 1.643 lb\n\nSo, after 30 minutes, there will be approximately 1.643 pounds of salt in the tank."
