    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces two types of chairs: a wooden chair and a metal chair. The manufacturer has 20 units of metal and 30 units of wooden materials available in stock. The wooden chair requires 2 units of wood and 1 unit of metal to produce, while the metal chair requires 1 unit of wood and 3 units of metal to produce. The profit for wooden chair is $20 and for metal chair is $30. The manufacturer wants to maximize the profit by deciding how many chairs of each type to produce, while respecting the material constraints. Formulate and solve the problem using mixed-integer programming to figure out how many wooden chairs and metal chairs the manufacturer should produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of wooden chairs and y be the number of metal chairs produced.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized):\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints (material availability):\n2x + y <= 30 (wood constraint)\nx + 3y <= 20 (metal constraint)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can now solve this mixed-integer programming problem.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Wood constraint:\ny <= 30 - 2x\n\n2. Metal constraint:\ny <= (20 - x) / 3\n\n3. Non-negativity constraint:\nx, y >= 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. We'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the constraint equations:\n\n1. Intersection of wood constraint and metal constraint:\n2x + y = 30\nx + 3y = 20\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\nx = 10, y = 0\n\n2. Intersection of wood constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 0 = 30\nx = 15\n\n3. Intersection of metal constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + 3y = 20\ny = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n\nNow we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(10, 0) = 20(10) + 30(0) = 200\n2. P(15, 0) = 20(15) + 30(0) = 300\n3. P(0, 6.67) = 20(0) + 30(6.67) ≈ 200.1\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (15, 0), with a profit of $300. Therefore, the manufacturer should produce 15 wooden chairs and no metal chairs to maximize the profit."
