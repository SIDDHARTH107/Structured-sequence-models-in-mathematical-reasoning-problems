    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we will first analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 96, which can be factored as 2^5 * 3. Therefore, G has a 2-Sylow subgroup of order 32 and a 3-Sylow subgroup of order 3.\n\nLet P be a 2-Sylow subgroup of G and Q be a 3-Sylow subgroup of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, divides 3 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, divides 32 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C96.\nIf G is isomorphic to C96, then G must have a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, i.e., n_2 = n_3 = 1. In this case, P and Q are both normal in G, and since their orders are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, which is a cyclic group of order 96.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2.\nIn this case, G is a direct product of three groups: A4, which has order 12, C4, which has order 4, and C2, which has order 2. The order of G is then 2^4 * 3, which is not equal to 96. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nCase 3: G is one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\nIf G is non-abelian, then it cannot be a direct product of abelian groups. Since the 2-Sylow subgroup P is abelian (as all groups of order 2^5 are abelian), it must not be normal in G. Thus, n_2 must be 3. Similarly, since the 3-Sylow subgroup Q is also abelian (as all groups of order 3 are abelian), it must not be normal in G. Thus, n_3 must be either 4 or 16.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C96 if it has unique 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2. If G is non-abelian, it must have multiple 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups, and it could be one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. To determine which specific group G is isomorphic to, further information about the structure of G would be needed."
