    "message_1": "A rectangular plot of land has an area of 800 square meters. What are the dimensions of the plot that minimize the cost of fencing it with a fence that costs $10 per meter along its longer side and $5 per meter along its shorter side?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the longer side be x meters and the length of the shorter side be y meters. The area of the rectangular plot is given by:\n\nArea = x * y = 800\n\nWe need to minimize the cost of fencing. The cost of fencing is given by:\n\nCost = 10x + 5y\n\nWe can express y in terms of x using the area equation:\n\ny = 800/x\n\nNow substitute this expression for y in the cost equation:\n\nCost = 10x + 5(800/x)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we can find the derivative of the cost function with respect to x and set it to zero:\n\nd(Cost)/dx = 10 - (4000/x^2)\n\nNow set the derivative to zero and solve for x:\n\n10 - (4000/x^2) = 0\n\n4000/x^2 = 10\n\nx^2 = 400\n\nx = 20 (since x must be positive)\n\nNow substitute x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = 800/20\n\ny = 40\n\nSo the dimensions of the plot that minimize the cost of fencing are 20 meters for the longer side and 40 meters for the shorter side."
