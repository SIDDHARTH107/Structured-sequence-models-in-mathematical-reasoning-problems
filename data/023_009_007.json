    "message_1": "A metal bar of length 2L and thermal diffusivity α is insulated along its sides and at one end, while the temperature at the other end is kept at a constant T0. At the initial time, the temperature of the bar is given by:\n\nf(x) = sin(πx/L)\n\nUse the Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution u(x,t) in the bar at any later time t. Let α = 1 and L = 1. Also, let the initial temperature distribution be f(x) = sin(πx). Find the temperature distribution at t = 0.25.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution u(x,t) in the bar at any later time t, we can use the heat equation and its solution using Fourier series. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nSince the bar is insulated along its sides and at one end, we have the following boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = 0\nu(2L,t) = T0\n∂u/∂x |_(x=L) = 0\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nu(x,0) = f(x) = sin(πx)\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier series to find the solution to the heat equation. The general solution for the heat equation with the given boundary conditions is:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx/L) * exp(-α(nπ/L)²t)]\n\nwhere B_n are the Fourier coefficients. To find B_n, we can use the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(πx):\n\nB_n = (2/L) ∫[u(x,0) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nSince L = 1, we have:\n\nB_n = 2 ∫[sin(πx) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\n\nFor n = 1, B_1 = 1, and for n ≠ 1, B_n = 0. Therefore, the temperature distribution u(x,t) is:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(πx) * exp(-π²t)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 0.25:\n\nu(x, 0.25) = sin(πx) * exp(-π² * 0.25)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution u(x,t) in the bar at time t = 0.25."
