If the cost of producing one bicycle is $300 and the demand equation is given by p=1000-2q where p is the price and q is the quantity demanded, what is the optimal price and quantity that will maximize the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to find the optimal price and quantity. We can start by finding the revenue function, which is the product of price (p) and quantity (q). Given the demand equation p = 1000 - 2q, we can write the revenue function as:\n\nR(q) = p * q = (1000 - 2q) * q = 1000q - 2q^2\n\nNext, we need to find the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function. The cost function is given by C(q) = 300q (since it costs $300 to produce one bicycle). Therefore, the profit function is:\n\nP(q) = R(q) - C(q) = (1000q - 2q^2) - 300q = 700q - 2q^2\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum of the profit function. To do this, we can find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(q) = dP(q)/dq = 700 - 4q\n\nSetting P'(q) = 0:\n\n0 = 700 - 4q\n4q = 700\nq = 175\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a maximum by taking the second derivative of the profit function:\n\nP''(q) = d^2P(q)/dq^2 = -4\n\nSince P''(q) is negative, the critical point q = 175 corresponds to a maximum.\n\nNow that we have the optimal quantity, we can find the optimal price using the demand equation:\n\np = 1000 - 2q = 1000 - 2(175) = 1000 - 350 = $650\n\nSo, the optimal price is $650, and the optimal quantity is 175 bicycles to maximize the company's profit."
