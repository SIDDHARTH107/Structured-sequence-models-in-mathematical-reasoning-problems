    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, f(x) is the outer function and g(x) is the inner function.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the outer function, f(x) = sin(3x^2), with respect to its argument (3x^2):\n\nf'(x) = d(sin(3x^2))/d(3x^2) = cos(3x^2)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the inner function, g(x) = 3x^2:\n\ng'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx = 6x\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of the composite function f(g(x)):\n\n(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = cos(3x^2) * 6x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) is:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = 6x * cos(3x^2)"
