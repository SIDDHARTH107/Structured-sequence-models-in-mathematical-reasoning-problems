    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 84 and 60 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (84) by the smaller number (60) and find the remainder.\n   84 รท 60 = 1 with a remainder of 24.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (84) with the smaller number (60) and the smaller number with the remainder (24) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 60 and 24.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (60) by the new smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n   60 รท 24 = 2 with a remainder of 12.\n\n4. Replace the larger number (60) with the smaller number (24) and the smaller number with the remainder (12) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 24 and 12.\n\n5. Divide the new larger number (24) by the new smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n   24 รท 12 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n6. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 84 and 60 is 12."
