    "message_2": "The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a domain D and continuous on the boundary of D, then the function can be analytically continued across the boundary by reflecting the function across the boundary.\n\nLet's consider the function $f(z) = \\sqrt{z}$ defined on the upper half plane $\\mathfrak{Im}(z) > 0$. We want to find its analytic continuation to the lower half plane $\\mathfrak{Im}(z) < 0$.\n\nFirst, we need to find a function that is the reflection of $f(z)$ across the real axis. Let's denote this function as $g(z)$. Since the reflection of $z$ across the real axis is its complex conjugate $\\bar{z}$, we have:\n\n$$g(z) = f(\\bar{z}) = \\sqrt{\\bar{z}}$$\n\nNow, we want to find a function that is analytic in the lower half plane and agrees with $g(z)$ on the real axis. Let's denote this function as $h(z)$. We can define $h(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$h(z) = -\\sqrt{z}$$\n\nWe can see that $h(z)$ is analytic in the lower half plane, and it agrees with $g(z)$ on the real axis:\n\n$$h(\\bar{z}) = -\\sqrt{\\bar{z}} = g(z)$$\n\nThus, the analytic continuation of $f(z) = \\sqrt{z}$ to the lower half plane is given by the function $h(z) = -\\sqrt{z}$."
