    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nLet's find A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {4, 5}\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow let's find B x A:\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB = {4, 5}\nA = {1, 2, 3}\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. The elements in the pairs are the same, but their order is different. Therefore, A x B is not equal to B x A."
