    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem in Temporal Logic for a math student to solve:\n\nA system has three states, A, B, and C, and two inputs, X and Y. The system can transition between its states according to the following rules:\n\n1. If the system is in state A and input X is received, it moves to state B.\n2. If the system is in state A and input Y is received, it remains in state A.\n3. If the system is in state B and input X is received, it moves to state C.\n4. If the system is in state B and input Y is received, it moves to state A.\n5. If the system is in state C and input X is received, it remains in state C.\n6. If the system is in state C and input Y is received, it moves to state B.\n\nCreate a temporal logic formula that specifies the condition \"the system never ends up in state C.\"",
    "message_2": "To create a temporal logic formula that specifies the condition \"the system never ends up in state C,\" we can use Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to express this property. In LTL, we use the \"Globally\" operator (denoted by a square) to represent that a certain condition must hold at all times.\n\nLet's denote the states A, B, and C as propositions a, b, and c, respectively. The condition \"the system never ends up in state C\" can be represented as:\n\nG(Â¬c)\n\nThis formula states that it is globally true that the system is not in state C."
