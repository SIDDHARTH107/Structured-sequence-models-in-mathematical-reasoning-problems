    "message_2": "To find the number of possible sets of true statements, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to find the number of ways to choose 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 true statements out of the 10 statements.\n\nFor 6 true statements:\nC(10,6) = 10! / (6! * (10-6)!) = 210\n\nFor 7 true statements:\nC(10,7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!) = 120\n\nFor 8 true statements:\nC(10,8) = 10! / (8! * (10-8)!) = 45\n\nFor 9 true statements:\nC(10,9) = 10! / (9! * (10-9)!) = 10\n\nFor 10 true statements:\nC(10,10) = 10! / (10! * (10-10)!) = 1\n\nNow, we add the number of combinations for each case:\n\nTotal sets of true statements = 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 386\n\nSo, there are 386 possible sets of true statements that the program can produce."
