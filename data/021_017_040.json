    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 7 on the interval [-2, 5] using the differential evolution algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions.\n2. Mutate the population by applying the differential evolution algorithm.\n3. Perform selection by choosing the best solutions based on their fitness (i.e., the function value).\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a sufficiently small change in the best solution).\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the differential evolution algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 6*x**2 + 9*x + 7\n\ndef differential_evolution(population, f, bounds, mutation_factor, crossover_rate, max_iterations):\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        new_population = []\n        for i, x in enumerate(population):\n            a, b, c = population[np.random.choice(len(population), 3, replace=False)]\n            mutant = a + mutation_factor * (b - c)\n            mutant = np.clip(mutant, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n\n            trial = np.where(np.random.rand(len(x)) < crossover_rate, mutant, x)\n            if f(trial) < f(x):\n                new_population.append(trial)\n            else:\n                new_population.append(x)\n\n        population = np.array(new_population)\n\n    best_solution = min(population, key=f)\n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\nbounds = np.array([[-2], [5]])\npopulation_size = 20\nmutation_factor = 0.8\ncrossover_rate = 0.9\nmax_iterations = 1000\n\ninitial_population = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], (population_size, 1))\nbest_solution, best_value = differential_evolution(initial_population, f, bounds, mutation_factor, crossover_rate, max_iterations)\n\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 7 on the interval [-2, 5] is:\")\nprint(\"f(x) =\", best_value, \"at x =\", best_solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum value of the function and the corresponding x value. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the differential evolution algorithm. You can increase the population size or the number of iterations to improve the accuracy of the result."
