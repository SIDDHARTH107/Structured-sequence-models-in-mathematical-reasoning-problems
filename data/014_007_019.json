    "message_1": "A stream cipher generates a key stream of 32 bits. Using this key stream, encrypt the message \"HELLO\" (in ASCII code) by XOR-ing the key stream with the ASCII code of each character in the message. Display the encrypted message in binary code.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using a stream cipher with a 32-bit key stream, we first need to convert each character in the message to its ASCII code and then to binary. After that, we will XOR each character's binary code with the key stream. Since the key stream is not provided, I will use a placeholder key stream for demonstration purposes.\n\nLet's assume the key stream is: 10100111011010010101001101101010\n\n1. Convert \"HELLO\" to ASCII codes and then to binary:\n   H - 72 - 01001000\n   E - 69 - 01000101\n   L - 76 - 01001100\n   L - 76 - 01001100\n   O - 79 - 01001111\n\n2. XOR each character's binary code with the key stream (32 bits are too long for 8-bit ASCII characters, so we will use the first 8 bits of the key stream for each character):\n\n   01001000 (H) XOR 10100111 (first 8 bits of key stream) = 11101111\n   01000101 (E) XOR 10100111 (first 8 bits of key stream) = 11100010\n   01001100 (L) XOR 10100111 (first 8 bits of key stream) = 11101011\n   01001100 (L) XOR 10100111 (first 8 bits of key stream) = 11101011\n   01001111 (O) XOR 10100111 (first 8 bits of key stream) = 11101000\n\n3. The encrypted message in binary code is:\n   11101111 11100010 11101011 11101011 11101000\n\nPlease note that this example uses a placeholder key stream. To encrypt the message with a specific key stream, replace the placeholder with the given key stream and follow the same steps."
