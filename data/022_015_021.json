    "message_2": "To determine the image of the upper half of the complex plane under the map $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$, we first need to understand the behavior of the function on the upper half-plane.\n\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $y \\geq 0$. Then, the complex conjugate of $z$ is $\\bar{z} = x - iy$. The product of $z$ and its complex conjugate is $z\\bar{z} = (x + iy)(x - iy) = x^2 + y^2$. Therefore, we can rewrite the function $f(z)$ as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\bar{z}}{z\\bar{z}} = \\frac{x - iy}{x^2 + y^2} = \\frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} - i\\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the image of the upper half-plane under this function. Since $y \\geq 0$, the imaginary part of $f(z)$ is non-positive:\n\n$$-\\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} \\leq 0$$\n\nThis means that the image of the upper half-plane under $f(z)$ lies in the lower half-plane, including the real axis.\n\nNow, let's apply the Schwarz reflection principle. The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a domain and continuous up to the boundary, then it can be analytically continued to the reflection of the domain across the boundary.\n\nSince $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$ is analytic in the upper half-plane and continuous up to the real axis, we can apply the Schwarz reflection principle to analytically continue $f(z)$ to the lower half-plane. The reflection of the upper half-plane across the real axis is the lower half-plane, so the image of the lower half-plane under $f(z)$ is the upper half-plane, including the real axis.\n\nTherefore, the image of the upper half of the complex plane, including the real axis, under the map $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$ is the lower half of the complex plane, including the real axis."
