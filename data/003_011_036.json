    "message_1": "A ship leaves a port and sails 10km due east. It then turns and sails 15km on a bearing of 040°. What is the distance between the ship and the port at this point (to the nearest kilometer), and what bearing must the ship follow to return to the port? (Assume the Earth is flat for this problem)",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the law of cosines and some trigonometry. Let's denote the port as point A, the point where the ship sails 10 km due east as point B, and the final position of the ship after sailing 15 km on a bearing of 040° as point C.\n\nWe have a triangle ABC, where AB = 10 km, BC = 15 km, and angle BAC = 40° (since the bearing is 040°).\n\nFirst, let's find the distance between the ship and the port (AC). We can use the law of cosines:\n\nAC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 * AB * BC * cos(angle BAC)\nAC^2 = 10^2 + 15^2 - 2 * 10 * 15 * cos(40°)\nAC^2 ≈ 200.97\nAC ≈ √200.97 ≈ 14.17 km (to the nearest kilometer, it's 14 km)\n\nNow, let's find the bearing the ship must follow to return to the port. We can use the law of sines to find angle ABC:\n\nsin(angle ABC) / AC = sin(angle BAC) / BC\nsin(angle ABC) ≈ (sin(40°) * 15) / 14.17\nangle ABC ≈ arcsin((sin(40°) * 15) / 14.17) ≈ 47.87°\n\nSince the ship initially sailed due east, angle ABE is 90°, where E is the east direction. So, the bearing to return to the port is:\n\nBearing = 90° - angle ABC ≈ 90° - 47.87° ≈ 42.13°\n\nThus, the distance between the ship and the port is approximately 14 km, and the ship must follow a bearing of approximately 042° to return to the port."
