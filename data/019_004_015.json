    "message_1": "A train leaves station A and travels towards station B at a speed of 60 km/h. At the same time, a car leaves station B and travels towards station A at a speed of 80 km/h. If the distance between station A and B is 360 km, at what time will the train and the car meet?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the time it takes for the train and the car to meet as t (in hours). During this time, the train will have traveled 60t kilometers, and the car will have traveled 80t kilometers. Since they are traveling towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel will be equal to the distance between station A and B, which is 360 km.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n60t + 80t = 360\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n140t = 360\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = 360 / 140\nt = 18 / 7\nt â‰ˆ 2.57 hours\n\nSo, the train and the car will meet approximately 2.57 hours after they start traveling towards each other."
