    "message_2": "1. To show that the point (0,0,0) is a singular point of the variety, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, and z, and then evaluate them at the point (0,0,0). If all the partial derivatives are zero at this point, then it is a singular point.\n\nThe equation is: x^3 + y^3 = 3z^3\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2\n∂f/∂z = -9z^2\n\nNow, let's evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (0,0,0):\n\n∂f/∂x(0,0,0) = 3(0)^2 = 0\n∂f/∂y(0,0,0) = 3(0)^2 = 0\n∂f/∂z(0,0,0) = -9(0)^2 = 0\n\nSince all the partial derivatives are zero at the point (0,0,0), it is a singular point of the variety.\n\n2. To find the equation of the tangent plane to the variety at the point (0,0,0), we can use the gradient of the function at this point. The gradient is given by the vector (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z), which we have already computed.\n\nThe gradient at the point (0,0,0) is (0, 0, 0). However, this gradient does not define a unique tangent plane, since the point (0,0,0) is a singular point. In this case, the tangent plane is not well-defined, and we cannot find a unique equation for it."
