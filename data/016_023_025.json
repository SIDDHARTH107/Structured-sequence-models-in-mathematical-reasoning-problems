    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the self-affine scaling parameter.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces. When the self-affine scaling parameter is set to 1/3, we have:\n\nD = log(5) / log(1/(1/3))\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the self-affine scaling parameter is set to 1/3 is approximately 1.47 (rounded to two decimal places)."
