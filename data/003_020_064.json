    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 5000 feet. The pilot needs to find the distance between the plane and a building on the ground. If the angle of depression from the plane to the top of the building is 30 degrees, what is the distance (in feet) between the plane and the building? (Round to the nearest foot)",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the plane and the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of depression is 30 degrees, which means the angle of elevation from the building to the plane is also 30 degrees.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the plane and the building as d, and the horizontal distance between the plane's vertical projection on the ground and the building as x. We can use the right triangle formed by the altitude of the plane (5000 feet), the horizontal distance x, and the distance d.\n\nIn this right triangle, we have:\n\ntan(30°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(30°) = 5000 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 5000 / tan(30°)\nx ≈ 5000 / 0.57735\nx ≈ 8658.5 feet\n\nNow that we have the horizontal distance x, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance d between the plane and the building:\n\nd^2 = x^2 + 5000^2\nd^2 = (8658.5)^2 + (5000)^2\nd^2 ≈ 75000000 + 25000000\nd^2 ≈ 100000000\n\nNow, we can find d:\n\nd = √100000000\nd ≈ 10000 feet\n\nSo, the distance between the plane and the building is approximately 10000 feet, rounded to the nearest foot."
