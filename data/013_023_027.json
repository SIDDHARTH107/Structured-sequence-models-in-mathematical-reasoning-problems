    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A is given $10 and decides how much to keep and how much to send to Player B. Player B receives this sent amount, and it is then multiplied by a factor (for example, 3). Player B then decides how much to keep and how much to return to Player A. \n\nIf Player A sends $3 to Player B, and the multiplication factor is 2, how much money should Player B return to Player A to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Player A sends $3 to Player B.\n2. The multiplication factor is 2, so Player B receives 3 * 2 = $6.\n3. Player B decides how much to keep and how much to return to Player A.\n\nTo maximize their own payoff, Player B should keep as much of the $6 as possible while still giving some amount back to Player A to maintain trust. In this case, Player B could return $1 to Player A and keep $5 for themselves. This way, Player A ends up with $10 - $3 + $1 = $8, and Player B has $5."
