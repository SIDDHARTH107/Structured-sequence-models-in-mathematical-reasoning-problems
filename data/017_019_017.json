    "message_2": "To prove this, we will construct a non-abelian group of order 36 that is not isomorphic to C36 or A4 × C3.\n\nLet's consider the group G = S3 × C6, where S3 is the symmetric group on 3 elements and C6 is the cyclic group of order 6. The order of G is |G| = |S3| × |C6| = 6 × 6 = 36.\n\nNow, let's show that G is non-abelian. Since S3 is non-abelian, there exist elements a, b ∈ S3 such that ab ≠ ba. Let c, d ∈ C6 be the identity elements of C6. Then, ((a, c), (b, d)) ∈ G, and we have:\n\n(ab, cd) ≠ (ba, dc) ⟹ (a, c)(b, d) ≠ (b, d)(a, c)\n\nThis shows that G is non-abelian.\n\nNext, we need to show that G is not isomorphic to C36. Since C36 is a cyclic group, it is abelian. However, we have already shown that G is non-abelian. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to C36.\n\nFinally, we need to show that G is not isomorphic to A4 × C3. The group A4 × C3 has an element of order 12, as (A4 has an element of order 3) × (C3 has an element of order 3). However, the maximum order of an element in G is 6, which can be seen by considering the orders of elements in S3 and C6. Since G does not have an element of order 12, G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C3.\n\nIn conclusion, we have constructed a non-abelian group G of order 36 that is not isomorphic to C36 or A4 × C3, proving the existence of such a group."
