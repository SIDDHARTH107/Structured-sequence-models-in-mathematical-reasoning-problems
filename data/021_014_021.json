    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profits per unit for product A and B are $4 and $6 respectively. The company has a production capacity of 60 units per day. The production process for one unit of product A and B require 1 and 2 hours respectively. The company wants to maximize its daily profit. Using genetic algorithms, what is the optimal production plan?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using genetic algorithms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the problem: Maximize daily profit with a production capacity of 60 units per day and given production times for products A and B.\n\n2. Represent the solution: We can represent the solution as a pair of integers (x, y) where x is the number of units of product A and y is the number of units of product B.\n\n3. Define the fitness function: The fitness function is the daily profit, which is calculated as (4x + 6y).\n\n4. Initialize the population: Create an initial population of random solutions (pairs of integers x and y).\n\n5. Evaluate the population: Calculate the fitness of each individual in the population.\n\n6. Selection: Select the best individuals (solutions) based on their fitness.\n\n7. Crossover: Create new offspring by combining the selected parents.\n\n8. Mutation: Randomly change some of the offspring's genes (x and y values).\n\n9. Evaluate the new population: Calculate the fitness of each individual in the new population.\n\n10. Repeat steps 6-9 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a certain number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level).\n\nAfter running the genetic algorithm, we will find the optimal production plan that maximizes the daily profit while satisfying the production constraints. The optimal solution will be a pair of integers (x, y) representing the number of units of product A and B to be produced daily."
