    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). The size of the maximum independent set is the largest possible number of vertices in such a set.\n\nLet's use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum independent set. If a vertex is in the independent set, then none of its neighbors can be in the set. Therefore, the more neighbors a vertex has, the fewer vertices can be in the independent set.\n\nTo maximize the size of the independent set, we want to minimize the degrees of the vertices in the set. Since the sum of the degrees is 20, there must be at least one vertex with degree at least 20/7 â‰ˆ 2.86. Since the degree must be an integer, there must be at least one vertex with degree at least 3.\n\nLet's assume that there is a vertex with degree 3 in the maximum independent set. Removing this vertex and its 3 neighbors leaves 3 vertices that can be in the independent set. So, the size of the maximum independent set is at least 3.\n\nNow, let's show that there is a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges for which the maximum independent set has size 3. Consider the following graph:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4\n|         |\n5 -- 6 -- 7\n\nThis graph has 7 vertices and 10 edges. The maximum independent set is {1, 6, 4}, which has size 3.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges is 3."
