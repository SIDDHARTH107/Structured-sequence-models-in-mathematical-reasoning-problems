    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, A △ B = {1, 4} because 1 is in A but not in B, and 4 is in B but not in A.\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ C. We already know A △ B = {1, 4}, so we need to find the symmetric difference between {1, 4} and C = {3, 4, 5}. The result is {1, 3, 5} because 1 is in {1, 4} but not in C, 3 is in C but not in {1, 4}, and 5 is in C but not in {1, 4}. So, (A △ B) △ C = {1, 3, 5}.\n\nNext, let's find B △ C. The symmetric difference between B and C is {2, 5} because 2 is in B but not in C, and 5 is in C but not in B.\n\nNow, let's find A △ (B △ C). We already know B △ C = {2, 5}, so we need to find the symmetric difference between A = {1, 2, 3} and {2, 5}. The result is {1, 3, 5} because 1 is in A but not in {2, 5}, 3 is in A but not in {2, 5}, and 5 is in {2, 5} but not in A. So, A △ (B △ C) = {1, 3, 5}.\n\nIn conclusion, both (A △ B) △ C and A △ (B △ C) are equal to {1, 3, 5}."
