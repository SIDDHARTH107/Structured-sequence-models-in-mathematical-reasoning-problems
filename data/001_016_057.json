    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we can use the rule for multiplying exponential expressions with the same base:\n\n$$a^{m} \\cdot a^{n} = a^{m+n}$$\n\nIn this case, our base is 2, and our exponents are 4 and 6. So, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$$2^{4} \\cdot 2^{6} = 2^{4+6}$$\n\nNow, we just need to add the exponents:\n\n$$2^{4+6} = 2^{10}$$\n\nSo, the simplified exponential expression is:\n\n$$2^{10}$$"
