    "message_1": "A professor wants to divide a class of 12 students into 4 groups of 3 for a project. Assuming that each group must have exactly 3 students, how many possible combinations of groups can the professor create?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. First, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 students out of 12. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (12) and k is the number of students in each group (3).\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12-3)!) = 12! / (3!9!) = 220\n\nNow, we have 220 ways to choose the first group of 3 students. After choosing the first group, we have 9 students left. We need to find the number of ways to choose 3 students out of the remaining 9:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!) = 9! / (3!6!) = 84\n\nNow, we have 84 ways to choose the second group of 3 students. After choosing the second group, we have 6 students left. We need to find the number of ways to choose 3 students out of the remaining 6:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = 20\n\nNow, we have 20 ways to choose the third group of 3 students. After choosing the third group, we have 3 students left, which will automatically form the fourth group.\n\nTo find the total number of possible combinations of groups, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose each group. However, since the order of the groups does not matter, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 4 groups, which is 4! (4 factorial).\n\nTotal combinations = (220 * 84 * 20) / 4! = (220 * 84 * 20) / 24 = 1540\n\nSo, the professor can create 1540 different combinations of groups."
