    "message_1": "In a certain school, the probability of a student getting an A grade in Mathematics is 0.6, and the probability of a student getting an A grade in English is 0.8. If a student is selected at random from the school, what is the probability that the student will get an A grade in both Mathematics and English?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a student getting an A grade in both Mathematics and English, we need to multiply the individual probabilities together.\n\nProbability of getting an A in Mathematics = 0.6\nProbability of getting an A in English = 0.8\n\nProbability of getting an A in both subjects = (Probability of getting an A in Mathematics) × (Probability of getting an A in English)\n= 0.6 × 0.8\n= 0.48\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student will get an A grade in both Mathematics and English is 0.48 or 48%."
