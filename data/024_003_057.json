    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface of revolution formed by rotating the curve y = x^2 around the x-axis, we first need to parameterize the surface. Let's use the following parameterization:\n\nx(u, v) = u\ny(u, v) = u^2 * cos(v)\nz(u, v) = u^2 * sin(v)\n\nwhere u is the parameter along the x-axis and v is the parameter along the rotation angle. Now, we need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\nx_u = (1, 0, 0)\nx_v = (0, -u^2 * sin(v), u^2 * cos(v))\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = <x_u, x_u> = 1\nF = <x_u, x_v> = 0\nG = <x_v, x_v> = u^4 * sin^2(v) + u^4 * cos^2(v) = u^4\n\nNow, we compute the second derivatives:\n\nx_uu = (0, 0, 0)\nx_uv = (0, -2u * cos(v), 2u * sin(v))\nx_vv = (0, -u^2 * cos(v), -u^2 * sin(v))\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <x_uu, N> = 0\nM = <x_uv, N> = 2u\nN = <x_vv, N> = u^2\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector to the surface. We can compute N by taking the cross product of x_u and x_v and normalizing it:\n\nN = (x_u x x_v) / ||x_u x x_v|| = (2u^3 * cos(v), u, 2u^3 * sin(v)) / (u^2 * sqrt(1 + 4u^4))\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (0 * u^2 - (2u)^2) / (1 * u^4 - 0) = -4u^2 / u^4 = -4/u^2\n\nFinally, we evaluate K at the point (1, 1) on the surface:\n\nK(1, 1) = -4/1^2 = -4\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1) is -4."
