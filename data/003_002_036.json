    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean identity for sine and cosine to find sin(x):\n\nsin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nGiven that cos(x) = 1/2, we have:\n\nsin^2(x) + (1/2)^2 = 1\nsin^2(x) + 1/4 = 1\n\nSubtract 1/4 from both sides:\n\nsin^2(x) = 3/4\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nsin(x) = ±√(3/4)\nsin(x) = ±√3/2\n\nNow, we can find tan(x) using the sine and cosine values:\n\ntan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)\n\nWe have two possible values for sin(x), so we will find two possible values for tan(x):\n\ntan(x) = (√3/2) / (1/2) = √3\n\nand\n\ntan(x) = (-√3/2) / (1/2) = -√3\n\nSo, the possible values for sin(x) are ±√3/2, and the possible values for tan(x) are ±√3."
