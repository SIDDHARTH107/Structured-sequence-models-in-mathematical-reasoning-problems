    "message_1": "Suppose a new industrial system has been installed, and it consists of 4 identical components, each with a probability of 0.05 of failure. What is the probability that at most one of the components will fail?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at most one component will fail, we can calculate the probabilities of the following scenarios: no components fail, and exactly one component fails. Then, we will add these probabilities together.\n\n1. No components fail:\nThe probability of a component not failing is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. Since all components are independent, the probability of all 4 components not failing is 0.95^4 = 0.8145.\n\n2. Exactly one component fails:\nThere are 4 ways for exactly one component to fail (either the first, second, third, or fourth component fails). The probability of one component failing is 0.05, and the probability of the other three components not failing is 0.95^3 = 0.857375. So, the probability of exactly one component failing is 4 * 0.05 * 0.857375 = 0.171475.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two scenarios together:\n0.8145 (no components fail) + 0.171475 (exactly one component fails) = 0.985975.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at most one of the components will fail is approximately 0.986 or 98.6%."
