    "message_2": "To divide the group of 10 students into two groups of 6 and 4 students, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, k is the number of students in one group, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of ways to choose 6 students from 10, which can be represented as C(10, 6):\n\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6!(10-6)!)\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6!4!)\n\nNow, we'll calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nNow, we'll plug these factorials back into the combination formula:\n\nC(10, 6) = 3,628,800 / (720 × 24)\nC(10, 6) = 3,628,800 / 17,280\nC(10, 6) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different ways to divide the group of 10 students into two groups of 6 and 4 students, respectively."
