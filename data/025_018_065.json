    "message_2": "1. Show that the curve is smooth.\n\nTo show that the curve is smooth, we need to check that the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to x and y do not simultaneously vanish at any point on the curve. The defining equation is:\n\nF(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 3x - 2 = 0\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 3\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nFor a point (x, y) on the curve, we have F(x, y) = 0. If both partial derivatives vanish at this point, we have:\n\n-3x^2 + 3 = 0\n2y = 0\n\nThe first equation gives x^2 = 1, so x = ±1. The second equation gives y = 0. Thus, the only points where both partial derivatives could vanish are (1, 0) and (-1, 0). However, plugging these points back into the defining equation, we get:\n\nF(1, 0) = 0^2 - 1^3 + 3(1) - 2 = 0\nF(-1, 0) = 0^2 - (-1)^3 + 3(-1) - 2 = 0\n\nSince both points satisfy the defining equation, the curve is smooth.\n\n2. Find all rational points on the curve.\n\nTo find the rational points on the curve, we can use the method of descent. We first note that the curve has the rational points (1, 0) and (-1, 0), as shown above. We can then use these points to generate other rational points on the curve.\n\nLet P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2) be two rational points on the curve. Then the line through P and Q has the equation:\n\ny = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) * (x - x1) + y1\n\nSubstituting this into the curve equation and simplifying, we get:\n\ny^2 = (y2 - y1)^2 * (x - x1)^2 / (x2 - x1)^2 + 2y1(y2 - y1)(x - x1)/(x2 - x1) + y1^2\n\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of x, we can solve for x3 and y3, the coordinates of the third rational point R = (x3, y3) on the curve that is collinear with P and Q:\n\nx3 = (x1^2 + x1x2 + x2^2 - 3)/(x1 - x2)\ny3 = (y1(x1^2 - x2^2) - 2x1x2(y1 - y2))/(x1 - x2)\n\nUsing these formulas, we can generate new rational points on the curve starting from the known points (1, 0) and (-1, 0). However, after trying several combinations, we find that no new rational points are generated. Thus, the only rational points on the curve are (1, 0) and (-1, 0).\n\n3. Find the degree of the canonical bundle of the curve.\n\nThe canonical bundle of an algebraic curve is the line bundle associated with the canonical divisor, which is the divisor of the differential 1-forms on the curve. For a smooth plane curve defined by the equation F(x, y) = 0, the degree of the canonical bundle is given by the formula:\n\ndeg(K) = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2\n\nwhere d is the degree of the defining polynomial. In this case, d = 3, so the degree of the canonical bundle is:\n\ndeg(K) = (3 - 1)(3 - 2)/2 = 2(1)/2 = 1\n\n4. Determine whether the curve is projectively normal or not.\n\nA curve is projectively normal if and only if its homogeneous coordinate ring is generated by the degree 1 elements. In this case, the curve is given by the equation:\n\nY^2Z = X^3 - 3XZ^2 + 2Z^3\n\nThe homogeneous coordinate ring is generated by the monomials X, Y, and Z. Since the curve is smooth and has degree 3, it is a non-singular projective curve, and by the theorem of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, it is projectively normal."
