    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 3x + 2 using GWO, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of grey wolves.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each wolf.\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n4. Update the positions of the other wolves.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations).\n\nHere's a simplified implementation of the GWO algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population:\nLet's say we have a population of 10 wolves, and their initial positions (x-values) are randomly chosen between -3 and 3.\n\n2. Calculate the fitness of each wolf:\nEvaluate the function f(x) for each wolf's position and store the results.\n\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves:\nFind the wolves with the three best fitness values (lowest f(x) values) and label them as alpha, beta, and delta.\n\n4. Update the positions of the other wolves:\nFor each wolf, update its position using the following equations:\n\nX_new = X_alpha - A * D_alpha + X_beta - A * D_beta + X_delta - A * D_delta\n\nwhere X_new is the new position of the wolf, X_alpha, X_beta, and X_delta are the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves, A is a random number between 0 and 1, and D_alpha, D_beta, and D_delta are the distances between the current wolf and the alpha, beta, and delta wolves, respectively.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met:\nContinue updating the positions and fitness values of the wolves for a set number of iterations or until the minimum value converges.\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm, the position of the alpha wolf will be the approximate x-value that minimizes the function f(x). To find the minimum value of the function, simply plug this x-value back into the function.\n\nNote that the GWO algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution may not be the exact global minimum. However, it can provide a good approximation for complex optimization problems."
