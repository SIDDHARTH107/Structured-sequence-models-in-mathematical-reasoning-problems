    "message_2": "To find the probability that at most 10 light bulbs are defective, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective light bulbs\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of light bulbs (200 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective light bulbs (we want to find the probability for at most 10 defective light bulbs)\n- p is the probability of a light bulb being defective (0.05 in this case)\n\nWe need to find the probability for 0 to 10 defective light bulbs and then sum those probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 10)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(200, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(200-k)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 10 and sum them:\n\nP(X ≤ 10) = Σ [C(200, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(200-k)] for k = 0 to 10\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 10) ≈ 0.816\n\nSo, the probability that at most 10 light bulbs are defective in a sample of 200 is approximately 0.816 or 81.6%."
