    "message_2": "Since f(z) is analytic in domain D, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nWe are given u(x, y) = 2x^2 - 3y^2 + 4x + 6y - 1. Let's find the partial derivatives of u(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\n∂u/∂x = 4x + 4\n∂u/∂y = -6y + 6\n\nNow we need to find v(x, y) such that it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂v/∂y = 4x + 4\n∂v/∂x = 6y - 6\n\nIntegrate the first equation with respect to y:\n\nv(x, y) = (4x + 4)y + g(x)\n\nwhere g(x) is an arbitrary function of x.\n\nNow differentiate v(x, y) with respect to x:\n\n∂v/∂x = 4y + g'(x)\n\nWe know that ∂v/∂x = 6y - 6, so we can equate the two expressions:\n\n4y + g'(x) = 6y - 6\n\nNow, isolate g'(x):\n\ng'(x) = 2y - 6\n\nIntegrate g'(x) with respect to x:\n\ng(x) = 2yx - 6x + C\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nNow we can write v(x, y) as:\n\nv(x, y) = (4x + 4)y + 2yx - 6x + C\n\nv(x, y) = 2yx + 4xy - 6x + C\n\nNow we have both u(x, y) and v(x, y), so we can write f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\n\nf(z) = (2x^2 - 3y^2 + 4x + 6y - 1) + i(2yx + 4xy - 6x + C)\n\nf(z) = (2x^2 - 3y^2 + 4x + 6y - 1) + i(6xy - 6x + C)\n\nThis is the complex-valued function f(z) that is analytic in domain D and has the given harmonic function u(x, y)."
