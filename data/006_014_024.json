    "message_1": "A technology company has 50 servers, each of which has a 10% chance of failure in any given month. What is the probability that at least 5 servers will fail in a given month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (servers), k is the number of successes (failures), p is the probability of success (failure), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nIn this case, n = 50, p = 0.1, and we want to find the probability of at least 5 failures, so we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 5 to k = 50.\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k:\n\nP(X = 0) = (50 choose 0) * 0.1^0 * (1-0.1)^(50-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.9^50 ≈ 0.00515\n\nP(X = 1) = (50 choose 1) * 0.1^1 * (1-0.1)^(50-1) = 50 * 0.1 * 0.9^49 ≈ 0.02857\n\nP(X = 2) = (50 choose 2) * 0.1^2 * (1-0.1)^(50-2) = 1225 * 0.01 * 0.9^48 ≈ 0.07529\n\nP(X = 3) = (50 choose 3) * 0.1^3 * (1-0.1)^(50-3) = 19600 * 0.001 * 0.9^47 ≈ 0.12548\n\nP(X = 4) = (50 choose 4) * 0.1^4 * (1-0.1)^(50-4) = 230300 * 0.0001 * 0.9^46 ≈ 0.13707\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 5 failures:\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)) ≈ 1 - (0.00515 + 0.02857 + 0.07529 + 0.12548 + 0.13707) ≈ 1 - 0.37156 ≈ 0.62844\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 servers will fail in a given month is approximately 62.84%."
