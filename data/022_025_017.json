    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle with mass $m=2$ and potential energy function $V(x) = 4x^2 - 6x$, we first need to write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$,\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\psi(x)$ is the wave function, and $E$ is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for $m$ and $V(x)$:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + (4x^2 - 6x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$.\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation for the wave function $\\psi(x)$. Unfortunately, there is no general analytical solution for this equation, as it depends on the specific form of the potential energy function. In this case, the potential energy function is a quadratic function of $x$, which does not correspond to any of the well-known solvable cases in quantum mechanics (such as the harmonic oscillator or the infinite square well).\n\nTo find the solutions for this specific potential, one would typically resort to numerical methods, such as the shooting method or the finite difference method, to find the wave functions and corresponding energy eigenvalues. Alternatively, one could use perturbation theory or variational methods to approximate the solutions if the potential is close to a known solvable case."
