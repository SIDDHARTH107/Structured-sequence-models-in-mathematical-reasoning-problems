    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all automorphisms of the graph.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can find the automorphisms by considering the possible permutations of the vertices that preserve adjacency. The vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all connected to the central vertex X, so any automorphism must map each of these vertices to another vertex connected to X.\n\nThere are 8 possible automorphisms for this graph:\n\n1. Identity: (1)(2)(3)(4)(X)\n2. Swap vertices 1 and 2: (12)(3)(4)(X)\n3. Swap vertices 1 and 3: (13)(2)(4)(X)\n4. Swap vertices 1 and 4: (14)(2)(3)(X)\n5. Swap vertices 2 and 3: (1)(23)(4)(X)\n6. Swap vertices 2 and 4: (1)(24)(3)(X)\n7. Swap vertices 3 and 4: (1)(2)(34)(X)\n8. Swap vertices 1 and 2, and 3 and 4: (12)(34)(X)\n\nThese 8 automorphisms form the automorphism group of G, which can be denoted as Aut(G). This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, which is the group of symmetries of a square."
