    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 10 cm and the height is 8 cm. Plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (10 * 8) / 2\n\nArea = 80 / 2\n\nArea = 40 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 40 square centimeters."
