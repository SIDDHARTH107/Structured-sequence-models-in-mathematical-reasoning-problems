    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation y'' + 4y' + 5y = 0, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is given by:\n\nr^2 + 4r + 5 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nr = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(5))) / 2(1)\nr = (-4 ± √(16 - 20)) / 2\nr = (-4 ± √(-4)) / 2\nr = (-4 ± 2i) / 2\n\nSo, the roots are r1 = -2 + i and r2 = -2 - i.\n\nSince the roots are complex, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\ny(x) = e^(-2x) (C1 * cos(x) + C2 * sin(x))\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants."
