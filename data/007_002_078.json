    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 8756 is divided by 17, we can use the divisibility rule of 17. The rule states that for a number to be divisible by 17, subtract 5 times the last digit from the remaining digits, and the result should be divisible by 17.\n\nLet's apply the rule to 8756:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 5 times the last digit (6) from the remaining digits (875).\n875 - (5 * 6) = 875 - 30 = 845\n\nStep 2: Repeat the process for the new number (845).\n84 - (5 * 5) = 84 - 25 = 59\n\nThe result is 59, which is not divisible by 17. Therefore, 8756 is not divisible by 17. To find the remainder, we can simply divide 8756 by 17:\n\n8756 รท 17 = 515 R 1\n\nThe remainder when 8756 is divided by 17 is 1."
