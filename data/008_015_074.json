    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + y + z = 9 \n\n3x + 4y + 5z = 38 \n\nx + 3y + 3z = 23 \n\nUsing Cholesky decomposition method, solve for the values of x, y, and z.",
    "message_2": "The Cholesky decomposition method is not applicable to this system of linear equations because it requires a symmetric positive definite matrix. The given system of linear equations can be represented as a matrix equation Ax = b, where\n\nA = | 2  1  1 |\n    | 3  4  5 |\n    | 1  3  3 |\n\nb = |  9  |\n    | 38  |\n    | 23  |\n\nThe matrix A is not symmetric, so we cannot use the Cholesky decomposition method to solve this system of linear equations. Instead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to find the values of x, y, and z."
