    "message_2": "The quadratic residues of a prime number p are the numbers that can be represented as a square of an integer modulo p. To find the quadratic residues of 13, we need to compute the squares of the integers from 1 to (13-1)/2, which is 6, and then reduce them modulo 13.\n\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 13)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n4^2 ≡ 16 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 12 (mod 13)\n6^2 ≡ 36 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues of 13 are {1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12}."
