    "message_1": "Suppose we have a closed and bounded region in the plane, which can be represented as a disk of radius 1. Let's say that we consider all the possible ways in which we can tie a rope around this disk, forming a knot. How many different non-isomorphic knots can we form in this way?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, we can only form one non-isomorphic knot, which is the trivial knot or unknot. This is because any knot tied around the disk can be continuously deformed into the trivial knot without cutting the rope or passing it through itself.\n\nThe reason for this is that the disk is a simply connected region, meaning that it has no holes or gaps. In a simply connected region, any loop can be continuously shrunk to a point without leaving the region. Therefore, any knot tied around the disk can be untied by continuously deforming it within the disk's boundary, resulting in the trivial knot."
