    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start adding the edges to the minimum spanning tree, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n3. Repeat step 2 until we have (number of vertices - 1) edges in the minimum spanning tree.\n\nSorted edges by weight:\n1. (A, B) - 1\n2. (B, C) - 2\n3. (C, D) - 3\n4. (D, E) - 4\n5. (E, F) - 5\n6. (A, F) - 6\n7. (B, D) - 7\n8. (C, E) - 8\n\nNow, let's add the edges to the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add edge (A, B) - weight 1\n2. Add edge (B, C) - weight 2\n3. Add edge (C, D) - weight 3\n4. Add edge (D, E) - weight 4\n5. Add edge (E, F) - weight 5\n   (Adding edge (A, F) would form a cycle, so we skip it)\n6. Adding edge (B, D) or (C, E) would also form a cycle, so we don't add any more edges.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree has the following edges: (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, E), and (E, F).\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15."
