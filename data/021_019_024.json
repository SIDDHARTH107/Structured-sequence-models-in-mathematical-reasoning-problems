    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. Here, we will use the HS algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 6.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Harmony Memory Size (HMS): 10\n- Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): 0.8\n- Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): 0.3\n- Number of iterations: 100\n- Search space: [-10, 10]\n\nStep 2: Initialize the Harmony Memory (HM)\nGenerate 10 random solutions (harmonies) within the search space and store them in the HM.\n\nStep 3: Improvise a new harmony\nFor each decision variable (x in this case), do the following:\n- Generate a random number between 0 and 1. If it is less than HMCR, select a value from the HM for that variable. Otherwise, generate a random value within the search space.\n- Generate another random number between 0 and 1. If it is less than PAR, adjust the selected value slightly (e.g., add or subtract a small random number).\n\nStep 4: Update the Harmony Memory\nEvaluate the new harmony's objective function value (f(x)). If it is better than the worst harmony in the HM, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\nStep 5: Check the stopping criterion\nIf the number of iterations is reached, stop the algorithm. Otherwise, go back to Step 3.\n\nStep 6: Return the best solution\nReturn the harmony with the best objective function value (minimum f(x)) in the HM.\n\nAfter running the Harmony Search algorithm with the given parameters, you will get an approximate minimum value for the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 6. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the randomness involved in the algorithm. To improve the accuracy, you can increase the number of iterations or fine-tune the parameters."
