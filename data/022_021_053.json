    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 3t^2 - 5t + 2 using complex analysis techniques, we first recall the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) f(t) dt\n\nIn our case, f(t) = 3t^2 - 5t + 2. So, we need to find the Laplace transform of each term separately and then combine them.\n\n1) L{3t^2}:\nL{3t^2} = ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) (3t^2) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let u = t^2 and dv = e^(-st) dt. Then, du = 2t dt and v = -1/s e^(-st). Applying integration by parts:\n\n∫_0^∞ e^(-st) (3t^2) dt = -3/s [t^2 e^(-st)]_0^∞ + 3/s ∫_0^∞ 2t e^(-st) dt\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts again to the remaining integral. Let u = t and dv = e^(-st) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -1/s e^(-st). Applying integration by parts:\n\n3/s ∫_0^∞ 2t e^(-st) dt = -6/s^2 [t e^(-st)]_0^∞ + 6/s^2 ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) dt\n\nThe remaining integral is a simple exponential integral:\n\n6/s^2 ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) dt = 6/s^2 [-1/s e^(-st)]_0^∞ = 6/s^3\n\nSo, L{3t^2} = 6/s^3\n\n2) L{-5t}:\nL{-5t} = ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) (-5t) dt\n\nUsing integration by parts with u = -5t and dv = e^(-st) dt, we get:\n\nL{-5t} = 5/s [t e^(-st)]_0^∞ - 5/s ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) dt = 5/s^2\n\n3) L{2}:\nL{2} = ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) (2) dt = 2 ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) dt = 2 [-1/s e^(-st)]_0^∞ = 2/s\n\nNow, we combine the Laplace transforms of each term:\n\nL{3t^2 - 5t + 2} = L{3t^2} + L{-5t} + L{2} = 6/s^3 + 5/s^2 + 2/s\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = 3t^2 - 5t + 2 is F(s) = 6/s^3 + 5/s^2 + 2/s."
