    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first substitute the assumed solution ψ(x) = e^(-x^2/2)u(x) into the Schrödinger equation:\n\nd^2ψ/dx^2 + (λ - x^2)ψ = 0\n\nBy applying the chain rule, we find the first and second derivatives of ψ(x):\n\ndψ/dx = e^(-x^2/2)(-xu(x) + u'(x))\n\nd^2ψ/dx^2 = e^(-x^2/2)(x^2u(x) - 2xu'(x) + u''(x) - u(x))\n\nNow, substitute these derivatives back into the Schrödinger equation:\n\ne^(-x^2/2)(x^2u(x) - 2xu'(x) + u''(x) - u(x)) + (λ - x^2)e^(-x^2/2)u(x) = 0\n\nSince e^(-x^2/2) is never zero, we can divide both sides by it:\n\nx^2u(x) - 2xu'(x) + u''(x) - u(x) + (λ - x^2)u(x) = 0\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\nu''(x) - (1 - λ)u(x) = 0\n\nThis is a linear differential equation for u(x). The value of λ for which there is a non-zero solution u(x) that is bounded as x tends to infinity is given by the eigenvalues of the associated Hermite differential equation. The eigenvalues are λ = 2n + 1, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nSo, the value of λ for which there is a non-zero solution u(x) that is bounded as x tends to infinity is λ = 2n + 1, where n is a non-negative integer."
