    "message_1": "An ice cream vendor sells three flavors of ice cream: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. The vendor wants to know the favorite flavor among his customers. He randomly surveys 80 customers and their preference towards ice cream is noted. The results show that 30 customers prefer chocolate, 25 prefer vanilla, and the rest prefer strawberry. What is the estimated proportion of customers who prefer strawberry ice cream?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find out how many customers prefer strawberry ice cream. Since there are 80 customers in total and 30 prefer chocolate and 25 prefer vanilla, we can find the number of customers who prefer strawberry by subtracting the chocolate and vanilla preferences from the total number of customers:\n\n80 (total customers) - 30 (chocolate) - 25 (vanilla) = 25 (strawberry)\n\nNow, to find the estimated proportion of customers who prefer strawberry ice cream, we can divide the number of customers who prefer strawberry by the total number of customers:\n\n25 (strawberry) / 80 (total customers) = 0.3125\n\nSo, the estimated proportion of customers who prefer strawberry ice cream is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
