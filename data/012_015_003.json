    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a graph is connected if and only if it has at least (n-1) edges, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIn this case, n = 10, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is (10-1) = 9 edges.\n\nSince the graph G has 16 edges, which is greater than the minimum required number of edges (9), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, just knowing the number of vertices and edges is not enough to definitively conclude that the graph is connected. We would need more information about the structure of the graph or the specific connections between vertices to make a definitive conclusion."
