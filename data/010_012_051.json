If yes, describe all such differential structures. If no, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "No, there is no smooth differential structure on R^3 that agrees with the standard differential structure except near A and B. The reason is that both A and B are submanifolds of R^3, and their differential structures are induced by the standard differential structure on R^3.\n\nThe set A is a hyperboloid of one sheet, which is a smooth surface in R^3. The set B is a sphere, which is also a smooth surface in R^3. Both of these surfaces are submanifolds of R^3, and their tangent spaces at each point are determined by the standard differential structure on R^3.\n\nSince the differential structure of a submanifold is induced by the ambient manifold (in this case, R^3), it is not possible to change the differential structure near A and B without changing the differential structure of R^3 itself. However, R^3 has a unique smooth differential structure up to diffeomorphism, which is the standard differential structure. Therefore, there is no smooth differential structure on R^3 that agrees with the standard differential structure except near A and B."
