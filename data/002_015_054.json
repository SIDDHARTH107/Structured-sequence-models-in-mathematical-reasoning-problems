    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle, also known as the circumference, can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 cm, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2π(5 cm)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 5 cm\nC ≈ 31.4159 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the circle is approximately 31.4159 cm."
