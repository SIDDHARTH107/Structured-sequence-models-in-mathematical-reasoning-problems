The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNote that the symmetric difference of B and B is the empty set, since all elements in B are also in B.\n\nB △ B = {}\n\nNow let's find A × (B △ B). Since B △ B is an empty set, the Cartesian product of A and the empty set will also be an empty set.\n\nA × (B △ B) = {}\n\nNow, let's compare (A × B) △ B and A × (B △ B):\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nA × (B △ B) = {}\n\nSince (A × B) △ B is not equal to A × (B △ B), we have shown that (A × B) △ B is not equal to A × (B △ B)."
