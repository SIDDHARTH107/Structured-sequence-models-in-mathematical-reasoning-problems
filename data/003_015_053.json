A rider boards the Ferris wheel at the lowest point and is at a height of 10 feet when the ride begins. Write an equation for the height of the rider as a function of time and determine the amplitude and period of the ride.",
    "message_2": "To model the height of the rider as a function of time, we can use a sinusoidal function. Since the rider starts at the lowest point, we will use a cosine function. The general form of the cosine function is:\n\nh(t) = A * cos(B * (t - C)) + D\n\nwhere h(t) is the height of the rider at time t, A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the horizontal shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nThe diameter of the Ferris wheel is 60 feet, so the radius is 30 feet. This means that the amplitude A is 30 feet, as the rider will move 30 feet above and below the center of the Ferris wheel.\n\nThe period of the Ferris wheel is the time it takes to complete one revolution, which is given as 30 seconds. The period is related to the B value in the cosine function by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nWe can solve for B:\n\n30 = 2π / B\nB = 2π / 30\nB = π / 15\n\nSince the rider starts at the lowest point, there is no horizontal shift, so C = 0.\n\nThe vertical shift D is the height of the center of the Ferris wheel. The rider starts at a height of 10 feet, which is the lowest point, so the center of the Ferris wheel is 30 feet above this point (the radius). Therefore, D = 10 + 30 = 40 feet.\n\nNow we can write the equation for the height of the rider as a function of time:\n\nh(t) = 30 * cos(π/15 * t) + 40\n\nThe amplitude of the ride is 30 feet, and the period is 30 seconds."
