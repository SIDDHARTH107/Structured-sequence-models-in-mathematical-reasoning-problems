    "message_2": "In a simple undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. Since there are eight vertices and each vertex has a degree of three, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 8 * 3 = 24.\n\nHowever, each edge is counted twice in this sum (once for each of its two vertices). To find the actual number of edges, we need to divide the sum of the degrees by 2:\n\nNumber of edges = (Sum of degrees) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12\n\nSo, the graph has 12 edges."
