    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the Cholesky decomposition method, we first need to rewrite the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the variable vector, and b is the constant vector.\n\nA = | 2  1  3 |\n    | 0  1  4 |\n    | 3  1 -2 |\n\nb = | 14 |\n    |  6 |\n    |  4 |\n\nNow, we need to find the Cholesky decomposition of A, which is the lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, such that A = LL^T.\n\nFirst, we need to make sure that the matrix A is symmetric and positive definite. In this case, the matrix A is not symmetric, so we cannot use the Cholesky decomposition method directly. However, we can still solve the system using other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition.\n\nFor this example, we will use Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Eliminate x from the second and third equations:\n\nR3 = R3 - (3/2)R1\nNew system:\n\n2x +  y + 3z = 14\ny + 4z = 6\n-1/2y - 11/2z = -17\n\n2. Eliminate y from the third equation:\n\nR3 = R3 - (-1/2)R2\nNew system:\n\n2x +  y + 3z = 14\ny + 4z = 6\nz = 2\n\n3. Back-substitute to find y and x:\n\ny + 4(2) = 6\ny = -2\n\n2x + (-2) + 3(2) = 14\n2x = 8\nx = 4\n\nSo the solution to the system is x = 4, y = -2, and z = 2."
