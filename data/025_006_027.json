    "message_2": "To show that $X(\\mathbb{C})$ has infinitely many points if $X$ has a rational point, we will use the fact that $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^r$ for some positive integer $r$. This implies that the first cohomology group has rank $r$, which means there are $r$ linearly independent elements in the group.\n\nNow, let $P$ be a rational point on $X$. Since $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ has rank $r$, there exist $r$ linearly independent elements $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots, \\alpha_r$ in the cohomology group. We can consider the sum of these elements with the rational point $P$:\n\n$Q_i = P + \\alpha_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, r$.\n\nSince the $\\alpha_i$ are linearly independent, the points $Q_i$ are distinct. Moreover, since $P$ is a rational point and the $\\alpha_i$ are elements of the cohomology group with integer coefficients, the points $Q_i$ are also rational points on $X$. Thus, we have found $r$ distinct rational points on $X$.\n\nNow, let us consider the curve $X$ defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + x$. We will show that if $X$ has a rational point, then $X(\\mathbb{C})$ has infinitely many points.\n\nFirst, observe that the curve $X$ is an elliptic curve, and its group law is well-defined. If $X$ has a rational point, let it be the point at infinity, denoted by $O$. Then, for any point $P \\in X(\\mathbb{C})$, we have $P + O = P$. This implies that the set of points on $X(\\mathbb{C})$ forms a group under the group law of the elliptic curve.\n\nNow, let $P$ be any non-identity element in $X(\\mathbb{C})$. Then, the multiples of $P$, denoted by $nP = P + P + \\dots + P$ ($n$ times), are distinct points on $X(\\mathbb{C})$ for all positive integers $n$. This is because if $nP = mP$ for some positive integers $n$ and $m$, then $(n - m)P = O$, which implies that $P$ has finite order. However, this contradicts the fact that $X$ is an elliptic curve, as elliptic curves have no non-identity elements of finite order.\n\nTherefore, the multiples of $P$ form an infinite set of distinct points on $X(\\mathbb{C})$. Since $P$ was an arbitrary non-identity element in $X(\\mathbb{C})$, we can conclude that $X(\\mathbb{C})$ has infinitely many points if $X$ has a rational point."
