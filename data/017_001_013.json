    "message_2": "Let's denote the four elements of the group as e, a, b, and c, where e is the identity element. There are two possible group structures for a group with 4 elements: the cyclic group of order 4 (denoted as Z4) and the Klein four-group (denoted as V).\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 4 (Z4):\n\nThe multiplication table for Z4 is:\n\n```\n  e a b c\ne e a b c\na a b c e\nb b c e a\nc c e a b\n```\n\nIn this group, a has order 4, and the other elements are its powers: e = a^0, b = a^2, and c = a^3. This group is cyclic because there is an element (in this case, a) whose powers generate the entire group.\n\n2. Klein four-group (V):\n\nThe multiplication table for V is:\n\n```\n  e a b c\ne e a b c\na a e c b\nb b c e a\nc c b a e\n```\n\nIn this group, all non-identity elements have order 2: a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. The group is not cyclic because there is no single element whose powers generate the entire group. Instead, it is the Klein four-group, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2: V = Z2 Ã— Z2.\n\nIn summary, there are two possible multiplication tables for a group with 4 elements: one forms a cyclic group (Z4), and the other forms the Klein four-group (V)."
