    "message_2": "First, let's show that the number of elements in the homomorphism $\\phi: \\pi_1(X, x_0) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(X, x_1)$ is equal to the number of sheets of the covering $p: \\tilde{X} \\rightarrow X$ over the path from $x_0$ to $x_1$. \n\nSince $X$ is path-connected, there exists a path $f: [0, 1] \\rightarrow X$ such that $f(0) = x_0$ and $f(1) = x_1$. Let $F: [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\rightarrow X$ be a homotopy between $f$ and the constant path at $x_0$, i.e., $F(0, t) = f(t)$ and $F(1, t) = x_0$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. \n\nNow, consider the lifted homotopy $\\tilde{F}: [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\tilde{X}$ such that $p \\circ \\tilde{F} = F$ and $\\tilde{F}(0, 0) = \\tilde{x}_0$. Since $p$ is a covering map, such a lift exists and is unique. Moreover, $\\tilde{F}(1, 0) \\in p^{-1}(x_0)$, and the number of distinct endpoints $\\tilde{F}(1, t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ is equal to the number of sheets of the covering $p$ over the path from $x_0$ to $x_1$. \n\nFor each $t \\in [0, 1]$, let $\\tilde{f}_t: [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\tilde{X}$ be the path given by $\\tilde{f}_t(s) = \\tilde{F}(s, t)$. Then, $p \\circ \\tilde{f}_t$ is a loop in $X$ based at $x_0$, and the homotopy class $[p \\circ \\tilde{f}_t]$ is an element of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$. Moreover, the map $t \\mapsto [p \\circ \\tilde{f}_t]$ is a bijection between the set of distinct endpoints $\\tilde{F}(1, t)$ and a subset of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$. \n\nNow, consider the homomorphism $\\phi: \\pi_1(X, x_0) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(X, x_1)$ induced by the path $f$. By definition, $\\phi([p \\circ \\tilde{f}_t]) = [p \\circ \\tilde{f}_t * f]$, where $*$ denotes the concatenation of paths. Since $p$ is a covering map, the number of distinct homotopy classes $[p \\circ \\tilde{f}_t * f]$ is equal to the number of distinct endpoints $\\tilde{F}(1, t)$, which is the number of sheets of the covering $p$ over the path from $x_0$ to $x_1$. \n\nNow, let's find the number of sheets of the covering map $p: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow S^1$ defined by $p(t) = (\\cos(2\\pi t), \\sin(2\\pi t))$ over the path from $x_0 = (1, 0)$ to $x_1 = (-1, 0)$. \n\nConsider the path $f: [0, 1] \\rightarrow S^1$ given by $f(t) = (\\cos(\\pi t), \\sin(\\pi t))$. Then, $f(0) = x_0$ and $f(1) = x_1$. Let $\\tilde{f}: [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be the lift of $f$ such that $p \\circ \\tilde{f} = f$ and $\\tilde{f}(0) = 0$. Then, $\\tilde{f}(1) = n$ for some integer $n$, since $p(n) = p(0) = x_0$. \n\nWe have $f(1) = (\\cos(\\pi), \\sin(\\pi)) = (-1, 0)$, so $p(\\tilde{f}(1)) = p(n) = (\\cos(2\\pi n), \\sin(2\\pi n)) = (-1, 0)$. This implies that $2\\pi n = \\pi + 2\\pi k$ for some integer $k$, so $n = \\frac{1}{2} + k$. Since $\\tilde{f}(1)$ is an integer, we must have $k = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $n = 1$. \n\nTherefore, the number of sheets of the covering map $p: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow S^1$ over the path from $x_0$ to $x_1$ is 1."
