    "message_1": "A student wants to measure the intelligence of their classmates based on a scale of 0 to 10. However, they recognize that intelligence is not a completely black-and-white concept and that classmates may have varying degrees of intelligence. Using fuzzy logic, they assign fuzzy values to each classmate's intelligence rating, ranging from 0 to 1. The ratings are as follows:\n\n- Jake: 0.7\n- Sara: 0.8\n- Anthony: 0.6\n- Emily: 0.9\n\nBased on these fuzzy values, what is the average intelligence rating of the class? Round your answer to 2 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the average intelligence rating of the class, we will add up the fuzzy values of each student's intelligence and then divide by the total number of students.\n\nThe sum of the fuzzy values is:\n0.7 (Jake) + 0.8 (Sara) + 0.6 (Anthony) + 0.9 (Emily) = 3.0\n\nThere are 4 students in total, so we will divide the sum by 4:\n\n3.0 / 4 = 0.75\n\nThe average intelligence rating of the class, rounded to 2 decimal places, is 0.75."
