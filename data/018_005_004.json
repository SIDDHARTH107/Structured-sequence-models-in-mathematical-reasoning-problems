    "message_2": "The complement of Set A, denoted as A', contains all elements that are not in Set A. By definition, there is no element that can be both in Set A and its complement A' at the same time.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of Set A and its complement A', denoted as A ∩ A'. Since there is no element that can be both in Set A and A', the intersection of these two sets will not contain any elements. In other words, A ∩ A' is an empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nProof:\n\nLet x be an element in the intersection of Set A and its complement A', i.e., x ∈ A ∩ A'. By the definition of intersection, this means that x ∈ A and x ∈ A' simultaneously. However, this contradicts the definition of the complement, which states that an element cannot be in both Set A and its complement A' at the same time. Therefore, there can be no such element x, and the intersection of Set A and its complement A' must be the empty set ∅.\n\nThus, A ∩ A' = ∅."
