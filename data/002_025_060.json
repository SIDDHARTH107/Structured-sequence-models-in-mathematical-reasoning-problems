    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle, we need more information. There are multiple possibilities for the third side depending on the angles of the triangle. \n\nFor example, if the isosceles triangle is also an equilateral triangle, then the third side would also be 8 cm. However, if the triangle is a right-angled isosceles triangle, then the third side would be the hypotenuse, and we could use the Pythagorean theorem to find its length. In that case, the third side would be √(8² + 8²) = √128 ≈ 11.31 cm.\n\nPlease provide more information about the angles or the type of isosceles triangle to determine the exact length of the third side."
