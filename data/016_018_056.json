    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, the initial segment consists of one interval of length 1. After the first step, we remove the middle third, leaving two intervals of length 1/3 each. So, N = 2 and r = 3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.6309."
