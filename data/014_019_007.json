If the encrypted message appears as \"MTAIHMASIECFUN\", what is the correct order of the letters in the transposition cipher?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to rearrange the encrypted message \"MTAIHMASIECFUN\" into the original 5 rows and 4 columns format. \n\nFirst, let's divide the encrypted message into equal parts based on the number of columns:\n\nMTAI\nHMAS\nIECF\nUN\n\nNow, we need to read the message column-wise to get the original message:\n\nM H I U\nT A E N\nA M C F\nI S F\n\nReading column-wise, we get the original message: \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\".\n\nSo, the correct order of the letters in the transposition cipher is:\n\n1 5 9 13\n2 6 10 14\n3 7 11 15\n4 8 12 16"
