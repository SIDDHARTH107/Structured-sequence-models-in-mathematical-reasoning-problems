    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface of genus 3, we can use the formula for the Euler characteristic of a surface of genus g:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere χ is the Euler characteristic and g is the genus of the surface. In this case, g = 3, so we have:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4\n\nSo the Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface of genus 3 is -4.\n\nNow, let's consider the state-sum model of (2+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theory with values in the semisimple Lie algebra sl(2,C). In this context, the Euler characteristic is related to the partition function of the theory, which is a sum over all possible states of the system. However, the specific details of the state-sum model and the Lie algebra sl(2,C) do not affect the topological invariant, which is the Euler characteristic.\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface of genus 3 remains -4, even when considering the state-sum model of (2+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theory with values in the semisimple Lie algebra sl(2,C)."
