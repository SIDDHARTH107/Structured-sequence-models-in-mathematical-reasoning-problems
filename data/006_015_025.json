    "message_1": "A company's cybersecurity team has determined that the probability of a malware attack on their network is 0.25, and the probability of a DDoS attack is 0.15. Find the probability that there will be at least one successful cyber attack on the company's network.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one successful cyber attack, we can use the complementary probability rule. This rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nLet A be the event of a malware attack and B be the event of a DDoS attack. We want to find the probability of A or B occurring (at least one successful cyber attack).\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of neither A nor B occurring (no successful cyber attack). This means that there is no malware attack and no DDoS attack. \n\nP(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 (probability of no malware attack)\nP(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (probability of no DDoS attack)\n\nSince the events A and B are not mutually exclusive (both can occur), we can use the multiplication rule for independent events to find the probability of both A' and B' occurring:\n\nP(A' and B') = P(A') * P(B') = 0.75 * 0.85 = 0.6375\n\nNow, we can use the complementary probability rule to find the probability of at least one successful cyber attack (A or B):\n\nP(A or B) = 1 - P(A' and B') = 1 - 0.6375 = 0.3625\n\nSo, the probability of at least one successful cyber attack on the company's network is 0.3625 or 36.25%."
