    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the scores in ascending order: 68, 73, 78, 79, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92.\n\nTo find the median, we take the average of the middle two numbers since there are an even number of scores: (80 + 82) / 2 = 81. So the median score is 81.\n\nTo find the interquartile range (IQR), we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). \n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (not including the overall median if the number of data points is odd): (73 + 78) / 2 = 75.5.\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (not including the overall median if the number of data points is odd): (85 + 88) / 2 = 86.5.\n\nNow, we can find the interquartile range by subtracting Q1 from Q3: 86.5 - 75.5 = 11.\n\nSo, the median score is 81 and the interquartile range is 11."
