    "message_2": "To find the median of the reaction times using the median absolute deviation (MAD) method, we first need to find the median of the data set. \n\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order:\n18, 20, 21, 22, 25, 30\n\nStep 2: Find the median:\nSince there are 6 data points (an even number), the median is the average of the middle two values (20 and 21).\nMedian = (20 + 21) / 2 = 41 / 2 = 20.5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the absolute deviations from the median:\n|18 - 20.5| = 2.5\n|20 - 20.5| = 0.5\n|21 - 20.5| = 0.5\n|22 - 20.5| = 1.5\n|25 - 20.5| = 4.5\n|30 - 20.5| = 9.5\n\nStep 4: Find the median of the absolute deviations:\nArrange the absolute deviations in ascending order:\n0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 9.5\n\nSince there are 6 absolute deviations (an even number), the median is the average of the middle two values (1.5 and 2.5).\nMedian Absolute Deviation (MAD) = (1.5 + 2.5) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the median of the reaction times is 20.5 ms, and the median absolute deviation (MAD) is 2 ms."
