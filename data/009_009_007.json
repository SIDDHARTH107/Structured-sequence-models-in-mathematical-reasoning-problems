    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box, we first need to consider the boundary conditions. Since V(x) = ∞ outside the box, the wave function ψ(x) must be zero at x = 0 and x = 1 Å. Inside the box, V(x) = 0, so the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\n(-h^2/8m) d^2ψ/dx^2 = Eψ\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, and its general solution is:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(8mE)/h.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0 (since ψ(0) = 0)\nψ(1 Å) = A sin(k) = 0 (since ψ(1 Å) = 0)\n\nThe second boundary condition implies that sin(k) = 0, which means k must be an integer multiple of π:\n\nk = nπ, where n is a positive integer.\n\nNow we can find the allowed energy levels E:\n\nk = sqrt(8mE)/h => E = (k^2 * h^2) / (8m)\n\nSubstituting k = nπ:\n\nE = (n^2 * π^2 * h^2) / (8m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for h and m:\n\nE = (n^2 * π^2 * (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s)^2) / (8 * 9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\n\nE = (n^2 * 3.1416^2 * 4.39 x 10^-68 J^2) / (7.29 x 10^-31 kg)\n\nE = 1.51 x 10^-37 n^2 J\n\nNow we can find the energy levels in eV by dividing by the charge of an electron (1.602 x 10^-19 C):\n\nE = (1.51 x 10^-37 n^2 J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 C)\n\nE = 9.42 x 10^-19 n^2 eV\n\nThe allowed energy levels of the particle in the one-dimensional box are given by:\n\nE = 1.51 x 10^-37 n^2 J (in Joules)\nE = 9.42 x 10^-19 n^2 eV (in electron volts)\n\nwhere n is a positive integer."
