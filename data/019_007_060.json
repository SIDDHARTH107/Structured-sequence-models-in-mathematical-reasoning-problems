    "message_1": "One classical problem in non-monotonic logic is the \"Dogs and Birds Paradox\". The student can be asked to solve the following problem:\n\nSuppose you know that \"Dogs bark\" and \"Birds can fly\", and that \"Tweety is a bird\". Does it follow that \"Tweety can fly\"? \n\nPlease give a precise answer, and explain the reasoning behind it.",
    "message_2": "Based on the given information, we can conclude that \"Tweety can fly.\" Here's the reasoning behind it:\n\n1. We know that \"Birds can fly.\"\n2. We are given that \"Tweety is a bird.\"\n3. Since Tweety is a bird and birds can fly, it follows that \"Tweety can fly.\"\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that there are no exceptions to the general rule that \"Birds can fly.\" In reality, there are some birds, like ostriches and penguins, that cannot fly. But since we are not given any additional information about Tweety or any exceptions to the rule, we can only conclude that \"Tweety can fly\" based on the information provided."
