    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2^(3x+1) = 32, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation with the same base on both sides.\nSince 32 is a power of 2 (2^5 = 32), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^(3x+1) = 2^5\n\nStep 2: Set the exponents equal to each other.\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n3x + 1 = 5\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3x = 4\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 4/3\n\nSo, the solution for x is x = 4/3."
