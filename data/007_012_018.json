    "message_2": "To use Wilson's theorem, we need to compute (18!) mod 19 and check if it's equal to 18.\n\nFirst, let's find the factorial of 18:\n\n18! = 18 × 17 × 16 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression by taking the modulus 19 at each step:\n\n(18 × 17 × 16 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1) mod 19\n\nSince 19 is a prime number, we can use the property a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) for all a such that gcd(a, p) = 1. In this case, p = 19.\n\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\n\n(18 × 17 × 16 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1) mod 19 = (18 × 17 × 16 × ... × 3 × 2) mod 19\n\nNow, we can apply the property mentioned above:\n\n(18 × 17 × 16 × ... × 3 × 2) mod 19 = (18^18 × 17^18 × 16^18 × ... × 3^18 × 2^18) mod 19\n\nUsing the property a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p), we get:\n\n(1 × 1 × 1 × ... × 1 × 1) mod 19 = 1\n\nSo, (18!) mod 19 = 1, which is not equal to 18.\n\nHowever, Wilson's theorem states that (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p) if and only if p is prime. In this case, we found that (18!) mod 19 = 1, which is equivalent to -18 (mod 19). Therefore, according to Wilson's theorem, 19 is a prime number."
