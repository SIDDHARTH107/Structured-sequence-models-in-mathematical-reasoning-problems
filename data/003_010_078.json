    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on a flat ground. From a point 20 meters away from the foot of the flagpole, the angle of elevation of the top of the pole is 35 degrees. What is the height of the flagpole to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 35 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the point to the foot of the flagpole (20 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the flagpole (which we want to find).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(35°) = height / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(35°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for the height:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(35°) ≈ 20 * 0.7002 ≈ 14.004\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the flagpole is approximately 14 meters."
