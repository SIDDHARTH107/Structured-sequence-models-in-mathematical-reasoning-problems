    "message_2": "Since X has a finite number of connected components, we can write X as a disjoint union of its connected components:\n\nX = X_1 ∪ X_2 ∪ ... ∪ X_n\n\nwhere each X_i is a connected component of X.\n\nNow, we use the fact that the cohomology groups of a disjoint union of topological spaces are the direct sum of the cohomology groups of the individual spaces:\n\nH^1(X, Z) = H^1(X_1, Z) ⊕ H^1(X_2, Z) ⊕ ... ⊕ H^1(X_n, Z)\n\nWe are given that H^1(X, Z) = Z/2Z. Since Z/2Z is a cyclic group of order 2, there are two possibilities for the direct sum decomposition:\n\n1) There is exactly one connected component X_i such that H^1(X_i, Z) = Z/2Z, and H^1(X_j, Z) = 0 for all j ≠ i. In this case, n = 1.\n\n2) There are exactly two connected components X_i and X_j (i ≠ j) such that H^1(X_i, Z) = H^1(X_j, Z) = Z/2Z, and H^1(X_k, Z) = 0 for all k ≠ i, j. In this case, n = 2.\n\nWe need to determine which of these possibilities is correct. To do this, we can use the fact that the first cohomology group with integer coefficients, H^1(X, Z), is related to the abelianization of the fundamental group of X, π_1(X):\n\nH^1(X, Z) = Hom(π_1(X), Z)\n\nSince X has a finite number of connected components, its fundamental group is a free product of the fundamental groups of its connected components:\n\nπ_1(X) = π_1(X_1) * π_1(X_2) * ... * π_1(X_n)\n\nNow, consider the abelianization of π_1(X). Since the abelianization of a free product is the direct sum of the abelianizations of the factors, we have:\n\nπ_1(X)^ab = π_1(X_1)^ab ⊕ π_1(X_2)^ab ⊕ ... ⊕ π_1(X_n)^ab\n\nSince H^1(X, Z) = Hom(π_1(X), Z) = Z/2Z, it follows that π_1(X)^ab = Z/2Z. This means that there must be exactly one connected component X_i such that π_1(X_i)^ab = Z/2Z, and π_1(X_j)^ab = 0 for all j ≠ i.\n\nThis corresponds to the first possibility mentioned above, where there is exactly one connected component X_i such that H^1(X_i, Z) = Z/2Z, and H^1(X_j, Z) = 0 for all j ≠ i. Therefore, the total number of connected components of X is n = 1."
