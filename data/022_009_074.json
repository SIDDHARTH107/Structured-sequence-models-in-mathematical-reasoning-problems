    "message_2": "To determine the radius of convergence and interval of convergence for the power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x-3)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^2+1}}{\\frac{(x-3)^n}{n^2+1}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(x-3)(n^2+1)}{(n+1)^2+1}\\right|$$\n\nNow, let's find the limit as n approaches infinity:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(x-3)(n^2+1)}{(n+1)^2+1}\\right| = (x-3)\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{n^2+1}{(n+1)^2+1}\\right|$$\n\nDivide both the numerator and denominator by $n^2$:\n\n$$= (x-3)\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{1+\\frac{1}{n^2}}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2+\\frac{1}{n^2}}\\right|$$\n\nAs $n$ approaches infinity, the terms with $n$ in the denominator approach 0:\n\n$$= (x-3)\\left|\\frac{1}{1^2}\\right| = |x-3|$$\n\nFor the series to converge, we need $|x-3| < 1$. This gives us the interval of convergence:\n\n$$2 < x < 4$$\n\nThe radius of convergence is half the length of the interval of convergence:\n\n$$R = \\frac{4-2}{2} = 1$$\n\nSo, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is $(2, 4)$. However, we need to check the endpoints to see if the series converges at $x=2$ and $x=4$.\n\nFor $x=2$, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2+1}$$\n\nThis is an alternating series, and since $\\frac{1}{n^2+1}$ is a decreasing sequence that approaches 0 as $n$ approaches infinity, the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.\n\nFor $x=4$, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^2+1}$$\n\nThis series converges by the Comparison Test, as it is dominated by the convergent p-series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^2}$ (with $p=2 > 1$).\n\nThus, the series converges at both endpoints, and the interval of convergence is $[2, 4]$. The radius of convergence is 1."
