    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and h be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * h\n\nWe are given that the volume should be 72 cubic inches:\n\nx^2 * h = 72\n\nNow, we need to minimize the surface area of the box. The surface area (SA) of the box with an open top is given by:\n\nSA = x^2 + 4 * (x * h)\n\nWe want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can first solve the volume equation for h and substitute it into the surface area equation:\n\nh = 72 / x^2\n\nSA = x^2 + 4 * (x * (72 / x^2))\n\nNow, we have the surface area as a function of x:\n\nSA(x) = x^2 + 288 / x\n\nTo minimize this function, we can find its critical points by taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(SA)/dx = 2x - 288 / x^2\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0:\n\n2x - 288 / x^2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2:\n\n2x^3 - 288 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nx^3 = 144\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 4∛(2^3 * 3^2) = 4∛(64) = 4\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of h:\n\nh = 72 / x^2 = 72 / 16 = 4.5\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will minimize the sum of the surface area are length = 4 inches, width = 4 inches, and height = 4.5 inches."
