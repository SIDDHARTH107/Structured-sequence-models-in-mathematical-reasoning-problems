Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.\n\n(Note: in Hyperbolic geometry, the formulas for calculating area and angles are different from those in Euclidean geometry.)",
    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet formula:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle measurements from degrees to radians:\n\nα = 80° = (80 * π) / 180 = (4 * π) / 9\nβ = 60° = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\nγ = 40° = (40 * π) / 180 = (2 * π) / 9\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Gauss-Bonnet formula:\n\nArea = π - ((4 * π) / 9 + π / 3 + (2 * π) / 9)\nArea = π - (6 * π) / 9\nArea = π - (2 * π) / 3\nArea = (3 * π - 2 * π) / 3\nArea = π / 3\n\nNow, we convert the area back to a decimal value:\n\nArea ≈ (π / 3) * (180 / π) ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the area of the hyperbolic triangle is approximately 60 square units, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
