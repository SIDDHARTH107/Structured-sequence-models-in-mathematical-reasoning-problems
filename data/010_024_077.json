    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the angles from degrees to radians. To do this, we use the formula: radians = degrees * (π/180).\n\nα = 60 degrees * (π/180) = π/3 radians\nβ = 70 degrees * (π/180) = 7π/18 radians\nγ = 50 degrees * (π/180) = 5π/18 radians\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the curvature of a hyperbolic triangle: K = α + β + γ - π.\n\nK = (π/3) + (7π/18) + (5π/18) - π\nK = (6π/18) + (7π/18) + (5π/18) - (18π/18)\nK = (18π/18) - (18π/18)\nK = 0\n\nThe curvature of the hyperbolic triangle with angles measuring 60 degrees, 70 degrees, and 50 degrees is 0."
