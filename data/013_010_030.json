    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly market with two companies: Company A and Company B. The inverse demand function is given by P = 100 - Q where P is the market price and Q is the total output of both companies.\n\nCompany A’s cost function is C_A(Q) = Q^2 + 2Q and Company B’s cost function is C_B(Q) = 4Q^2 - 8Q.\n\nWhat is the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantity and price in this market?",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot-Nash equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction functions for both companies. The reaction function shows the optimal output for each company given the output of the other company.\n\nLet q_A and q_B be the outputs of Company A and Company B, respectively. Then, the total output Q = q_A + q_B.\n\nThe profit functions for both companies are:\n\nΠ_A = P * q_A - C_A(q_A) = (100 - Q) * q_A - (q_A^2 + 2q_A)\nΠ_B = P * q_B - C_B(q_B) = (100 - Q) * q_B - (4q_B^2 - 8q_B)\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit functions with respect to each company's output, taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n\nFor Company A:\ndΠ_A/dq_A = (100 - Q) - 2q_A - q_B = 0\n\nFor Company B:\ndΠ_B/dq_B = (100 - Q) - 8q_B + 8 - q_A = 0\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (q_A and q_B):\n\n1) 98 - 2q_A - q_B = 0\n2) 108 - 8q_B - q_A = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nq_A = 20\nq_B = 30\n\nNow we can find the total output Q and the market price P:\n\nQ = q_A + q_B = 20 + 30 = 50\nP = 100 - Q = 100 - 50 = 50\n\nSo, the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantity is 50 units, with Company A producing 20 units and Company B producing 30 units. The equilibrium market price is 50."
