    "message_2": "The logistic equation is given by:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) * e^(-r*t) / P0)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, K = 800, P0 = 200, r = 0.6, and t = 5.\n\nP(5) = 800 / (1 + (800 - 200) * e^(-0.6*5) / 200)\n\nP(5) = 800 / (1 + 600 * e^(-3) / 200)\n\nP(5) = 800 / (1 + 3 * e^(-3))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-3) and then find P(5).\n\ne^(-3) ≈ 0.049787\n\nP(5) = 800 / (1 + 3 * 0.049787)\n\nP(5) = 800 / (1 + 0.149361)\n\nP(5) = 800 / 1.149361\n\nP(5) ≈ 696.21\n\nAfter 5 years, the population of squirrels will be approximately 696."
