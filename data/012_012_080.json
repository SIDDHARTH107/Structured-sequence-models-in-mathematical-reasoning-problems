    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to determine the girth of the given graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have 10 vertices and 15 edges, so the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 15 = 30.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum degree of a vertex in the graph. If the minimum degree is 3, then each vertex is connected to at least 3 other vertices. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one pair of vertices that share a common neighbor, which would form a cycle of length 3 (a triangle).\n\nIf the minimum degree is 2, then each vertex is connected to at least 2 other vertices. In this case, the graph would be a tree, which means it would have 10 - 1 = 9 edges. However, we have 15 edges, so the minimum degree must be at least 3.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph is 3, as there must be a cycle of length 3 (a triangle) in the graph."
