    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $10,000 to allocate among 3 projects. The expected profits (in thousands of dollars) for each project are:\n\n- Project A: 5x\n- Project B: 2x^2\n- Project C: 4x\n\nWhere x represents the percentage of the budget allocated to each project (e.g. if x=0.5, then half of the budget is allocated to that project).\n\nWhat is the optimal allocation of the budget among the three projects to maximize the total expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total expected profit, we need to find the optimal values of x for each project. Let x_A, x_B, and x_C represent the percentage of the budget allocated to projects A, B, and C, respectively. Since the total budget is $10,000, we have:\n\nx_A + x_B + x_C = 1\n\nThe expected profits for each project are:\n\n- Project A: 5x_A\n- Project B: 2x_B^2\n- Project C: 4x_C\n\nThe total expected profit is:\n\nP_total = 5x_A + 2x_B^2 + 4x_C\n\nWe want to maximize P_total with respect to x_A, x_B, and x_C, subject to the constraint x_A + x_B + x_C = 1.\n\nTo do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function L:\n\nL(x_A, x_B, x_C, λ) = 5x_A + 2x_B^2 + 4x_C + λ(1 - x_A - x_B - x_C)\n\nNow we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x_A, x_B, x_C, and λ, and set them equal to 0:\n\n∂L/∂x_A = 5 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂x_B = 4x_B - λ = 0\n∂L/∂x_C = 4 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 1 - x_A - x_B - x_C = 0\n\nSolving the first three equations for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 5\nλ = 4x_B\nλ = 4\n\nNow, equating the expressions for λ, we get:\n\n5 = 4x_B = 4\n\nFrom the last equation, we find that x_B = 1. However, this would mean that the entire budget is allocated to project B, which is not optimal. Therefore, we need to consider the case where x_B = 0.\n\nIf x_B = 0, then from the first and third equations, we have:\n\n5 = λ = 4\n\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no optimal solution with x_B = 0.\n\nHowever, we can still find an approximate solution by considering the case where x_B is very small. In this case, we can assume that x_A + x_C ≈ 1, and the total expected profit is approximately:\n\nP_total ≈ 5x_A + 4x_C\n\nSince x_A + x_C = 1, we can rewrite this as:\n\nP_total ≈ 5x_A + 4(1 - x_A) = 5x_A + 4 - 4x_A\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to x_A and setting it equal to 0, we get:\n\n∂P_total/∂x_A = 5 - 4 = 1\n\nThis implies that the optimal allocation is approximately x_A = 1 and x_C = 0, with x_B being very small. In other words, the company should allocate almost the entire budget to project A to maximize the total expected profit."
