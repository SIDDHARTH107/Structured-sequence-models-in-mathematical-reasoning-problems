    "message_1": "A Gosper curve starts with an equilateral triangle with a side length of 1. Each subsequent iteration increases the number of sides by a factor of 4. What is the perimeter of the tenth iteration of the Gosper curve? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the 10th iteration of the Gosper curve, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Perimeter * (Growth Factor)^Iteration\n\nThe initial perimeter is the perimeter of the equilateral triangle, which is 3 (since each side has a length of 1). The growth factor for the Gosper curve is 4, and we want to find the perimeter for the 10th iteration.\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (4)^10\nPerimeter ≈ 3 * 1,048,576\nPerimeter ≈ 3,145,728\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 10th iteration of the Gosper curve is approximately 3,145,728."
