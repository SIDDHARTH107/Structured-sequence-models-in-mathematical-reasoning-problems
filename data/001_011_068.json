    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we first need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for the three fractions is the product of the factors (x+3) and (x-2), which is (x^2 - x - 6). \n\nNow, we'll rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n[(x-2) - 2(x+3)] / [(x+3)(x-2)] = 3 / [(x^2 - x - 6)]\n\nNow that the denominators are the same, we can focus on the numerators:\n\n(x-2) - 2(x+3) = 3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx - 2 - 2x - 6 = 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-x - 8 = 3\n\nAdd x to both sides:\n\n-8 = x + 3\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n-11 = x\n\nSo, x = -11."
