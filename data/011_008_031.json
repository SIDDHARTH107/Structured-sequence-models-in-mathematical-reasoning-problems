    "message_1": "How many ways can you distribute 8 identical apples to 4 distinct baskets if each basket can have at most 3 apples?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use generating functions. Let's represent the number of apples in each basket as a_i, where i is the basket number (1 ≤ i ≤ 4). We want to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 8\n\nsubject to the constraint that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 for each i.\n\nThe generating function for each basket is:\n\n(1 + x + x^2 + x^3)\n\nThis represents the possible number of apples in each basket (0, 1, 2, or 3). Since there are 4 baskets, the generating function for the entire problem is:\n\n(1 + x + x^2 + x^3)^4\n\nWe want to find the coefficient of x^8 in the expansion of this generating function, as that will represent the number of ways to distribute the 8 apples.\n\nUsing the multinomial theorem, we can expand the generating function:\n\n(1 + x + x^2 + x^3)^4 = Σ (4!/(m_0!m_1!m_2!m_3!)) x^(m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all non-negative integers m_0, m_1, m_2, and m_3 such that m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 = 8 and m_0 + m_1 + m_2 + m_3 = 4.\n\nThere are 5 such terms:\n\n1. m_0 = 0, m_1 = 2, m_2 = 2, m_3 = 0: (4!/(0!2!2!0!)) = 6\n2. m_0 = 0, m_1 = 4, m_2 = 0, m_3 = 1: (4!/(0!4!0!1!)) = 1\n3. m_0 = 1, m_1 = 0, m_2 = 3, m_3 = 0: (4!/(1!0!3!0!)) = 4\n4. m_0 = 1, m_1 = 2, m_2 = 0, m_3 = 1: (4!/(1!2!0!1!)) = 12\n5. m_0 = 2, m_1 = 0, m_2 = 1, m_3 = 1: (4!/(2!0!1!1!)) = 12\n\nAdding these coefficients, we find that there are 6 + 1 + 4 + 12 + 12 = 35 ways to distribute the 8 apples among the 4 baskets with the given constraints."
