    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The production of each item requires two types of raw materials, Raw Material X and Raw Material Y. Each unit of Product A requires 5 units of Raw Material X and 3 units of Raw Material Y. Each unit of Product B requires 3 units of Raw Material X and 5 units of Raw Material Y. The company has 10 units of Raw Material X and 12 units of Raw Material Y. The profit of each unit of Product A is $8 and the profit of each unit of Product B is $12. The company wants to optimize its profits by determining the maximum number of units of each product to produce given the available raw materials. \n\nFormulate this as a semi-definite programming problem and determine the maximum profit the company can earn.",
    "message_2": "To formulate this problem as a linear programming problem, let's define the variables:\n\nLet x be the number of units of Product A produced.\nLet y be the number of units of Product B produced.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 8x + 12y\n\nConstraints (raw materials availability):\n5x + 3y ≤ 10 (Raw Material X constraint)\n3x + 5y ≤ 12 (Raw Material Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for Product A)\ny ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for Product B)\n\nNow, we need to solve this linear programming problem to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n5x + 3y ≤ 10\ny ≤ (10 - 5x) / 3\n\n3x + 5y ≤ 12\ny ≤ (12 - 3x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's the area enclosed by the lines y = (10 - 5x) / 3, y = (12 - 3x) / 5, x = 0, and y = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraints intersect:\n\nIntersection of y = (10 - 5x) / 3 and y = (12 - 3x) / 5:\n(10 - 5x) / 3 = (12 - 3x) / 5\n50 - 25x = 36 - 9x\n16x = 14\nx = 14/16 = 7/8\n\ny = (10 - 5(7/8)) / 3 = (10 - 35/8) / 3 = (45/8) / 3 = 15/8\n\nSo, the intersection point is (7/8, 15/8).\n\nIntersection of y = (10 - 5x) / 3 and y = 0:\n(10 - 5x) / 3 = 0\n10 - 5x = 0\nx = 2\n\nIntersection of y = (12 - 3x) / 5 and x = 0:\ny = (12 - 3(0)) / 5 = 12 / 5 = 2.4\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (2, 0), (0, 2.4), and (7/8, 15/8).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function P = 8x + 12y at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 8(0) + 12(0) = 0\nP(2, 0) = 8(2) + 12(0) = 16\nP(0, 2.4) = 8(0) + 12(2.4) = 28.8\nP(7/8, 15/8) = 8(7/8) + 12(15/8) = 7 + 22.5 = 29.5\n\nThe maximum profit is $29.5 when producing 7/8 units of Product A and 15/8 units of Product B. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a product, they should produce 1 unit of Product A and 2 units of Product B to achieve a profit of $28, which is the closest achievable profit to the maximum."
