    "message_2": "To simplify the given algebraic expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power.\n\nThe expression is: 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 3x^2 + 5x - 7\n\nFirst, let's identify the like terms:\n\n- 2x^2 and -3x^2 are like terms (both have x^2)\n- 4x^3 is the only term with x^3\n- 5x is the only term with x\n- -7 is the constant term\n\nNow, let's combine the like terms:\n\n(2x^2 - 3x^2) + 4x^3 + 5x - 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(-1x^2) + 4x^3 + 5x - 7\n\nSo, the simplified algebraic expression is:\n\n4x^3 - x^2 + 5x - 7"
