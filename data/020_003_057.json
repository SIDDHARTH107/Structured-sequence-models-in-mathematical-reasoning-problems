    "message_1": "Suppose a farmer has 400 acres of land to plant two crops: wheat and corn. The profit per acre for growing wheat is $200 and for growing corn is $300. The farmer can spend at most $50,000 on farming operations. Each acre of wheat requires $150 of farming costs and each acre of corn requires $200 of farming costs. Assuming that the farmer wants to maximize profits, how much of each crop should they plant?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of corn. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The total land available for planting is 400 acres: x + y = 400\n2. The farmer can spend at most $50,000 on farming operations: 150x + 200y ≤ 50,000\n3. The profit per acre for growing wheat is $200, and for growing corn is $300: Profit = 200x + 300y\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function (200x + 300y) subject to the constraints x + y = 400 and 150x + 200y ≤ 50,000.\n\nFirst, let's solve the equation x + y = 400 for y: y = 400 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the inequality 150x + 200y ≤ 50,000:\n\n150x + 200(400 - x) ≤ 50,000\n150x + 80,000 - 200x ≤ 50,000\n-50x ≤ -30,000\nx ≥ 600\n\nSince x represents the number of acres of wheat, it cannot be greater than 400. Therefore, the inequality has no solution in this context, and we need to consider the case where the farmer spends exactly $50,000 on farming operations:\n\n150x + 200(400 - x) = 50,000\n150x + 80,000 - 200x = 50,000\n-50x = -30,000\nx = 600\n\nAgain, this solution is not valid in this context since x cannot be greater than 400. This means that the farmer cannot spend the entire $50,000 on farming operations. In this case, we can assume that the farmer will use all the available land (400 acres) and divide it between wheat and corn to maximize profits.\n\nNow, let's substitute the expression for y in the profit function:\n\nProfit = 200x + 300(400 - x)\nProfit = 200x + 120,000 - 300x\nProfit = -100x + 120,000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to minimize the number of acres of wheat (x) since the profit per acre for corn is higher than for wheat. Therefore, the farmer should plant 0 acres of wheat and 400 acres of corn.\n\nSo, the farmer should plant 0 acres of wheat and 400 acres of corn to maximize profits."
