    "message_1": "Suppose two travelers are caught with identical antique souvenirs that they want to sell. They are told that the souvenirs are worth between $1 and $100, but they do not know the exact value. Each person must simultaneously declare a selling price. The catch is that the person who chooses the LOWER price will sell his souvenir for the price he chose, while the person who chooses the HIGHER price will sell his souvenir for TWO DOLLARS LESS than the price he chose. If the two choose the same price, they will each sell their souvenirs for that price. What selling price (in dollars) should each traveler choose in order to maximize his profit and minimize his loss?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation. If both travelers choose the same price, they will both sell their souvenirs for that price. However, if one traveler chooses a higher price, he will sell his souvenir for two dollars less than the price he chose. Therefore, each traveler wants to choose a price that is slightly lower than the other traveler's price to maximize their profit.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario for each traveler. If one traveler chooses a price of $1, the other traveler can choose a price of $2 and sell his souvenir for $1, which is two dollars less than the price he chose. In this case, both travelers sell their souvenirs for $1, which is the minimum possible value.\n\nNow, let's consider the best-case scenario for each traveler. If one traveler chooses a price of $100, the other traveler can choose a price of $99 and sell his souvenir for $99, which is the maximum possible value. In this case, the traveler who chose the higher price will sell his souvenir for $98, which is two dollars less than the price he chose.\n\nTo maximize their profit and minimize their loss, each traveler should choose a price that is slightly lower than the other traveler's price. Since the souvenirs are worth between $1 and $100, a reasonable strategy would be for each traveler to choose a price around the midpoint of this range, which is $50. This way, if both travelers choose the same price, they will each sell their souvenirs for $50. If one traveler chooses a slightly higher price, he will sell his souvenir for $48, which is two dollars less than the price he chose. This strategy balances the potential profit and loss for each traveler."
