    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform technique, we first need to express the function y(t) as a Fourier series. Since the given boundary conditions are homogeneous (y(0) = y(2π) = 0), we can use the sine Fourier series representation:\n\ny(t) = ∑[B_n * sin(nω₀t)]\n\nwhere ω₀ = 2π / (2π) = 1, and B_n are the Fourier coefficients to be determined.\n\nNow, let's plug the Fourier series representation into the given differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 9y(t) = 0\n\nTaking the second derivative of y(t) with respect to t, we get:\n\ny''(t) = ∑[-n²ω₀²B_n * sin(nω₀t)]\n\nNow, substitute y(t) and y''(t) into the differential equation:\n\n∑[-n²ω₀²B_n * sin(nω₀t)] + 9∑[B_n * sin(nω₀t)] = 0\n\nSince the sine functions are linearly independent, we can equate the coefficients of each sine function:\n\n-n²ω₀²B_n + 9B_n = 0\n\nSolve for B_n:\n\nB_n = 0 for n² ≠ 9\nB_n is arbitrary for n² = 9\n\nSince n² = 9, n = ±3. Therefore, the solution y(t) can be expressed as:\n\ny(t) = B_3 * sin(3t) + B_{-3} * sin(-3t)\n\nHowever, since sin(-3t) = -sin(3t), we can rewrite the solution as:\n\ny(t) = C * sin(3t)\n\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant. This is the general solution to the given differential equation using the Fourier transform technique."
