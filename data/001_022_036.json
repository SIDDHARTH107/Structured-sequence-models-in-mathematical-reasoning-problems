    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept(s) of a polynomial function, we need to set the function equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it by factoring:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the polynomial function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 are x = 2 and x = 3."
