    "message_2": "To find the value of λ such that the integral equation has a unique continuous solution φ(x) that satisfies φ(0) = 0, we will use the Fredholm Alternative Theorem. The theorem states that for a given λ, the integral equation has a unique solution if and only if the corresponding homogeneous equation has only the trivial solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation corresponding to the given integral equation is:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = \\lambda\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\sin(\\pi(x+t))}{1+t^2}\\psi(t)dt$$\n\nNow, let's consider the operator T acting on a function ψ(x) as follows:\n\n$$(T\\psi)(x) = \\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\sin(\\pi(x+t))}{1+t^2}\\psi(t)dt$$\n\nThe given homogeneous equation can be written as:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = \\lambda(T\\psi)(x)$$\n\nWe need to find λ such that the only solution to this equation is the trivial solution, i.e., ψ(x) = 0 for all x.\n\nLet's estimate the norm of the operator T:\n\n$$\\|T\\psi\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]}|(T\\psi)(x)| \\leq \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{|\\sin(\\pi(x+t))|}{1+t^2}|\\psi(t)|dt$$\n\nSince |sin(π(x+t))| ≤ 1, we have:\n\n$$\\|T\\psi\\|_\\infty \\leq \\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{1+t^2}\\|\\psi\\|_\\infty dt = \\|\\psi\\|_\\infty \\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{1+t^2}dt$$\n\nThe integral ∫₀¹(1/(1+t²))dt is the integral of the arctangent derivative, so its value is arctan(1) - arctan(0) = π/4. Therefore:\n\n$$\\|T\\psi\\|_\\infty \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\|\\psi\\|_\\infty$$\n\nNow, if we choose |λ| < 4/π, then:\n\n$$\\|\\lambda T\\psi\\|_\\infty \\leq \\frac{4}{\\pi}|λ|\\|\\psi\\|_\\infty < \\|\\psi\\|_\\infty$$\n\nBy the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, for |λ| < 4/π, the homogeneous equation has only the trivial solution, and thus the original integral equation has a unique continuous solution φ(x) that satisfies φ(0) = 0."
