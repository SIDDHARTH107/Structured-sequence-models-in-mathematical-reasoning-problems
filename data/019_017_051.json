Is the following sentence true or false in the L-structure {Z,<}, where Z is the set of integers and < is the usual ordering relation on Z?\n\nFor every integer x, there exists an integer y such that y<x.",
    "message_2": "The sentence is true in the L-structure {Z,<}, where Z is the set of integers and < is the usual ordering relation on Z.\n\nFor every integer x, there exists an integer y such that y<x. This is true because, for any given integer x, we can always find an integer y that is less than x. For example, if x is any integer, we can choose y = x - 1, which will always be less than x. Since this holds for all integers x, the sentence is true in the given L-structure."
