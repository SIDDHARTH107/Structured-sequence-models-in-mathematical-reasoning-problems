    "message_2": "Since Alice has 4 oranges and Bob has 7 apples, we can represent the total number of fruits they have as follows:\n\nTotal Fruits = Alice's Oranges + Bob's Apples\n\nTotal Fruits = 4 (Alice's Oranges) + 7 (Bob's Apples)\n\nTotal Fruits = 4 + 7\n\nTotal Fruits = 11\n\nSo, Alice and Bob have a total of 11 pieces of fruit."
