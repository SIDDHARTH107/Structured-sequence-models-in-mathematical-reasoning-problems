    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C (opposite to the respective sides), the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have one angle (52 degrees) and two sides (8 meters and 10 meters). Let's label the sides a = 8 meters and b = 10 meters, and the angle C = 52 degrees. We want to find the length of side c.\n\nc² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(52)\nc² = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos(52)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 52 degrees. Make sure your calculator is in degree mode.\n\ncos(52) ≈ 0.6157\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\n\nc² = 64 + 100 - 160 * 0.6157\nc² ≈ 64 + 100 - 98.512\nc² ≈ 65.488\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc ≈ √65.488\nc ≈ 8.092\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 8 + 10 + 8.092\nPerimeter ≈ 26.092 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 26.092 meters."
