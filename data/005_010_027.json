    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is not specific to Bayesian statistics but is a general probability formula for discrete events. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as \"n choose k\"\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips)\n- k is the number of successes (heads)\n- p is the probability of success (0.7 for heads in this case)\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the probability of getting exactly 7 heads in 10 flips, so n = 10 and k = 7. The probability of getting heads, p, is 0.7.\n\nFirst, we need to find C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 items from a set of 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\n          = 10! / (7! * 3!)\n          = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n          = 120\n\nNow we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * p^7 * (1-p)^(10-7)\n         = 120 * (0.7)^7 * (0.3)^3\n         â‰ˆ 0.2668\n\nSo the probability of getting exactly 7 heads in 10 flips of the coin is approximately 0.2668 or 26.68%."
