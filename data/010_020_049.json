    "message_2": "Floer homology is a mathematical concept used in the study of symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology. However, it is not applicable to the problem you presented, which involves a surface of revolution generated by rotating a curve around an axis.\n\nInstead, you might be interested in finding the volume or surface area of the solid formed by revolving the curve $y = x^2$ around the $x$-axis. To do this, you can use the methods of calculus, specifically the disk method (for volume) or the surface of revolution formula (for surface area).\n\nLet's compute the volume and surface area of the solid formed by revolving the curve $y = x^2$ around the $x$-axis from $x = a$ to $x = b$.\n\nVolume:\nUsing the disk method, the volume can be computed as:\n$$V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} (x^2)^2 dx = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} x^4 dx = \\pi \\left[\\frac{1}{5}x^5\\right]_{a}^{b} = \\frac{\\pi}{5}(b^5 - a^5)$$\n\nSurface Area:\nUsing the surface of revolution formula, the surface area can be computed as:\n$$A = 2\\pi \\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\sqrt{1 + (2x)^2} dx$$\n\nThis integral is quite complicated and does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, you can compute the surface area numerically for specific values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nIn summary, Floer homology is not applicable to this problem, but you can use calculus methods to find the volume and surface area of the solid formed by revolving the curve $y = x^2$ around the $x$-axis."
