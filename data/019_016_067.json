    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of students who like both basketball and cricket, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal students = Students who like basketball + Students who like cricket - Students who like both\n\nLet x be the number of students who like both basketball and cricket.\n\n50 = 28 + 25 - x\n50 = 53 - x\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\nx = 53 - 50\nx = 3\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who like both basketball and cricket is 3."
