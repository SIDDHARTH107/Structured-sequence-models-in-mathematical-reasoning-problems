    "message_2": "Given A = 1, B = 0, and C = 1, we can substitute these values into the linear logic equation:\n\n1 & (0 ⊸ 1) ⊢ (1 & 0) ⊸ 1\n\nNow, let's evaluate the linear logic operators:\n\n1. The & (tensor) operator is true if both operands are true. In this case, we have:\n\n1 & (0 ⊸ 1)\n\nSince the second operand (0 ⊸ 1) needs to be evaluated, we move to the next operator.\n\n2. The ⊸ (linear implication) operator is true if the antecedent (left side) is false or the consequent (right side) is true. In this case, we have:\n\n0 ⊸ 1\n\nSince the antecedent (0) is false, the linear implication is true. Now we can evaluate the tensor operator:\n\n1 & (True)\n\nSince both operands are true, the tensor operator is true. So, the left side of the ⊢ (turnstile) is true:\n\nTrue ⊢ (1 & 0) ⊸ 1\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right side of the turnstile:\n\n(1 & 0) ⊸ 1\n\n3. First, we need to evaluate the tensor operator:\n\n1 & 0\n\nSince one of the operands is false, the tensor operator is false:\n\nFalse ⊸ 1\n\n4. Now, we evaluate the linear implication operator:\n\nFalse ⊸ 1\n\nSince the antecedent (False) is false, the linear implication is true. So, the right side of the turnstile is true:\n\nTrue ⊢ True\n\nSince both sides of the turnstile are true, the linear logic equation is valid."
