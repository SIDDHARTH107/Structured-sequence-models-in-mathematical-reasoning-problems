    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the linear system $|D|$ where $D$ is a divisor of degree $5$ on $C$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$$\nl(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g,\n$$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the linear system $|D|$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor on $C$, and $g$ is the genus of the curve $C$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. Since $C$ is a curve of degree $4$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, we can use the formula for the genus of a smooth plane curve of degree $d$:\n\n$$\ng = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}.\n$$\n\nIn our case, $d = 4$, so the genus of $C$ is:\n\n$$\ng = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2} = 3.\n$$\n\nNext, we need to find the canonical divisor $K_C$. For a smooth plane curve of degree $d$, the canonical divisor is given by:\n\n$$\nK_C = (d-3)H,\n$$\n\nwhere $H$ is the hyperplane divisor. In our case, $d = 4$, so the canonical divisor is:\n\n$$\nK_C = (4-3)H = H.\n$$\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem to find the dimension of the linear system $|D|$:\n\n$$\nl(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g.\n$$\n\nSince $D$ is a divisor of degree $5$, we have:\n\n$$\nl(D) - l(H - D) = 5 + 1 - 3 = 3.\n$$\n\nTo find $l(H - D)$, we need to compute the degree of $H - D$. Since $D$ has degree $5$ and $H$ has degree $1$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\deg(H - D) = \\deg(H) - \\deg(D) = 1 - 5 = -4.\n$$\n\nSince the degree of $H - D$ is negative, the linear system $|H - D|$ is empty, and thus $l(H - D) = 0$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\nl(D) = 3.\n$$\n\nSo the dimension of the linear system $|D|$ where $D$ is a divisor of degree $5$ on $C$ is $3$."
