    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global sections of L, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem for a line bundle L on a curve X of genus g is given by:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = d - g + 1\n\nwhere h^0(X, L) is the dimension of the space of global sections of L, h^1(X, L) is the dimension of the space of global sections of the dual line bundle L^*, and d is the degree of L.\n\nIn our case, we have g = 3 and d = 4. To compute h^1(X, L), we can use the Serre duality theorem, which states that:\n\nh^1(X, L) = h^0(X, L^* ⊗ K)\n\nwhere K is the canonical bundle on X. The canonical bundle has degree 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4. Since L has degree 4, the dual line bundle L^* has degree -4. Therefore, the degree of L^* ⊗ K is -4 + 4 = 0.\n\nA line bundle of degree 0 on a curve has no global sections unless it is the trivial bundle. In our case, L^* ⊗ K is not the trivial bundle, so h^0(X, L^* ⊗ K) = 0, and thus h^1(X, L) = 0.\n\nNow we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute h^0(X, L):\n\nh^0(X, L) - 0 = 4 - 3 + 1\nh^0(X, L) = 2\n\nSo the dimension of the space of global sections of L is 2."
