    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+3) + log2(x-3) = 4, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that logb(a) + logb(c) = logb(a*c). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog2((x+3)(x-3)) = 4\n\nNow, we can use the property that logb(a^c) = c * logb(a) to rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog2((x+3)(x-3)) = log2(2^4)\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the arguments equal to each other:\n\n(x+3)(x-3) = 2^4\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 3x - 9 = 16\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 - 9 = 16\n\nNow, add 9 to both sides:\n\nx^2 = 25\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides:\n\nx = Â±5\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid, since logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. Plugging x = 5 into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog2(5+3) + log2(5-3) = log2(8) + log2(2) = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nPlugging x = -5 into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog2(-5+3) + log2(-5-3) = log2(-2) + log2(-8)\n\nSince logarithms are not defined for negative arguments, x = -5 is not a valid solution.\n\nThus, the only solution for the equation is x = 5."
