    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 2x - 1) / (2x^2 - 5x + 3) as x approaches 1, we can simply substitute x = 1 into the function and simplify:\n\nf(1) = (3(1)^2 + 2(1) - 1) / (2(1)^2 - 5(1) + 3)\n\nf(1) = (3 + 2 - 1) / (2 - 5 + 3)\n\nf(1) = (4) / (0)\n\nSince the denominator is 0, the limit does not exist."
