    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x, we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x where the second derivative f''(x) equals zero:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nNow, we need to check if the second derivative changes its sign at x = 2. We can do this by testing the values of the second derivative on either side of x = 2:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6 (negative)\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6 (positive)\n\nSince the second derivative changes its sign at x = 2, there is an inflection point at x = 2. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, we plug x = 2 back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) = 8 - 24 + 18 = 2\n\nSo, the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x is at (2, 2)."
