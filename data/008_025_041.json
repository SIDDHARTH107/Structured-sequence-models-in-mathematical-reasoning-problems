    "message_1": "Consider the system of linear equations: \n\n2x + 3y = 10\n\n4x + 6y = 20\n\nDoes this system have a solution? If not, why?",
    "message_2": "This system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. The reason is that the two equations are not independent; they are multiples of each other. \n\nTo see this, notice that the second equation can be obtained by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n\n2 * (2x + 3y) = 2 * 10\n4x + 6y = 20\n\nSince the two equations are essentially the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions, as any point on the line defined by the equation 2x + 3y = 10 will satisfy both equations."
