    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 6 cm. Determine the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism in centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal length (d) can be found using the formula:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 10 cm, w = 8 cm, and h = 6 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nd = √((10 cm)² + (8 cm)² + (6 cm)²)\nd = √(100 cm² + 64 cm² + 36 cm²)\nd = √(200 cm²)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is:\n\nd = √(200 cm²) = 10√2 cm"
