    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using Fourier series, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the initial condition u(x,0) = 3x(1-x) on the boundary 0≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nu(x,0) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and L is half the period of the function. In this case, L = 1.\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[u(x,0) * dx] from 0 to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[u(x,0) * cos(nπx/L) * dx] from 0 to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[u(x,0) * sin(nπx/L) * dx] from 0 to L\n\nSince the initial condition is an odd function, all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫[3x(1-x) * sin(nπx) * dx] from 0 to 1\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = 3x(1-x) and dv = sin(nπx)dx\ndu = (3-6x)dx and v = -cos(nπx)/(nπ)\n\nNow, using integration by parts:\n\n∫[u * dv] = uv - ∫[v * du]\nb_n = 2 * [(3x(1-x) * (-cos(nπx)/(nπ)) - ∫[(-cos(nπx)/(nπ)) * (3-6x) * dx] from 0 to 1\n\nLet u' = 3-6x and dv' = -cos(nπx)/(nπ)dx\ndu' = -6dx and v' = sin(nπx)/(n²π²)\n\nNow, using integration by parts again:\n\n∫[u' * dv'] = u'v' - ∫[v' * du']\nb_n = 2 * [(3x(1-x) * (-cos(nπx)/(nπ)) - [(3-6x) * sin(nπx)/(n²π²) - ∫[sin(nπx)/(n²π²) * (-6) * dx]] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining term:\n\nb_n = 2 * [(3x(1-x) * (-cos(nπx)/(nπ)) - [(3-6x) * sin(nπx)/(n²π²) + (6/(n²π²)) * (-cos(nπx))]] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can evaluate the expression at the limits:\n\nb_n = 2 * [(3(1)(0) * (-cos(nπ(1))/(nπ)) - [(3-6(1)) * sin(nπ(1))/(n²π²) + (6/(n²π²)) * (-cos(nπ(1)))]) - (3(0)(1) * (-cos(nπ(0))/(nπ)) - [(3-6(0)) * sin(nπ(0))/(n²π²) + (6/(n²π²)) * (-cos(nπ(0)))])\n\nb_n = 2 * [(-6 * sin(nπ)/(n²π²) + (6/(n²π²)) * (-cos(nπ))) - (3 * sin(nπ(0))/(n²π²) + (6/(n²π²)) * (-cos(nπ(0))))]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(nπ) = (-1)^n for integer values of n:\n\nb_n = 2 * [(-6 * 0/(n²π²) + (6/(n²π²)) * ((-1)^n - 1)) - (3 * 0/(n²π²) + (6/(n²π²)) * (1 - 1))]\n\nb_n = (12/(n²π²))((-1)^n - 1)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of u(x,0):\n\nu(x,0) = Σ[(12/(n²π²))((-1)^n - 1) * sin(nπx)]\n\nNow, we need to find the solution of the PDE at t=2 and x=0.5. The general solution of the given PDE is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[(12/(n²π²))((-1)^n - 1) * sin(nπx) * e^(-4(nπ)²t)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x=0.5 and t=2:\n\nu(0.5,2) = Σ[(12/(n²π²))((-1)^n - 1) * sin(nπ(0.5)) * e^(-4(nπ)²(2))]\n\nSince sin(nπ(0.5)) = sin(nπ/2) = 1 for odd n and 0 for even n, we can rewrite the series as:\n\nu(0.5,2) = Σ[(12/((2k+1)²π²))((-1)^(2k+1) - 1) * e^(-4((2k+1)π)²(2))] for k = 0,1,2,...\n\nu(0.5,2) = Σ[(12/((2k+1)²π²))(-2) * e^(-16(2k+1)²π²)] for k = 0,1,2,...\n\nu(0.5,2) = -24/π² * Σ[((1/((2k+1)²)) * e^(-16(2k+1)²π²)] for k = 0,1,2,...\n\nTo find the numerical value of u(0.5,2), we can sum the first few terms of the series. The series converges quickly, so we can truncate it after a few terms:\n\nu(0.5,2) ≈ -24/π² * (1 + 1/9 * e^(-144π²) + 1/25 * e^(-400π²) + ...)\n\nThe value of u(0.5,2) is approximately -0.3820."
