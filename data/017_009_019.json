    "message_2": "Since G has order 9, by the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 3. Let H be a subgroup of G generated by the element a, so H = {e, a, a^2} where e is the identity element. Since a has order 3, H is a cyclic group of order 3.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 9 and |H| = 3, we have |G/H| = 9/3 = 3. Thus, G/H is a cyclic group of order 3. Let G/H = {H, bH, b^2H} where b is an element of G not in H.\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIn this case, G is the direct product of its subgroups H and the subgroup generated by b. Since H is a cyclic group of order 3 and the subgroup generated by b is a cyclic group of order 3, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIn this case, we can show that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9. Define a multiplication operation on G by (a^i, b^j) * (a^k, b^l) = (a^(i+k), b^(j+l) * a^(jk)) for i, j, k, l = 0, 1, 2. This operation is well-defined, associative, and has an identity element (e, e). Moreover, every element in G has an inverse under this operation.\n\nNow, we can define a map φ: G → G' given by φ(a^i * b^j) = (a^i, b^j), where G' is the group with the above-defined multiplication operation. φ is a homomorphism, and it is easy to see that it is injective and surjective. Therefore, φ is an isomorphism, and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9."
