The monthly demand for the material follows a normal distribution with a mean of 500 units and a standard deviation of 100 units. The company incurs a fixed cost of $500 each time an order is placed, and a cost of $5 per unit of material ordered. The raw material can be stored indefinitely at zero cost. Using stochastic optimization, what is the optimal order quantity to minimize the average monthly cost of ordering and holding this raw material?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Newsvendor Model, which is a stochastic optimization model used to determine the optimal order quantity in situations with uncertain demand. In this case, the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 500 units and a standard deviation of 100 units.\n\nThe Newsvendor Model uses the critical fractile approach, which is given by the formula:\n\nCritical Fractile (CF) = Co / (Co + Ch)\n\nWhere Co is the cost of under-ordering (ordering too little) and Ch is the cost of over-ordering (ordering too much). In this problem, the cost of under-ordering is the cost per unit of material, which is $5. Since there is no holding cost, the cost of over-ordering is $0. Therefore, the critical fractile is:\n\nCF = 5 / (5 + 0) = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal order quantity (Q) using the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution. Since the critical fractile is 1, this means that we want to find the order quantity that corresponds to the 100th percentile of the demand distribution.\n\nUsing the mean (μ) of 500 units and the standard deviation (σ) of 100 units, we can find the optimal order quantity (Q) using the inverse CDF formula:\n\nQ = μ + σ * Z(CF)\n\nWhere Z(CF) is the Z-score corresponding to the critical fractile. Since CF = 1, the Z-score is infinity, which means that the optimal order quantity is also infinity.\n\nHowever, this result is not practical, as the company cannot order an infinite amount of raw material. In this case, the company should consider introducing a holding cost for the raw material, which would lead to a more realistic optimal order quantity."
