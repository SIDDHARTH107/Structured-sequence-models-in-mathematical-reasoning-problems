    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length by the width:\nArea_top_bottom = 10 cm * 6 cm = 60 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (top and bottom), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_top_bottom = 2 * 60 cm² = 120 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length by the height:\nArea_front_back = 10 cm * 4 cm = 40 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (front and back), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_front_back = 2 * 40 cm² = 80 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the width by the height:\nArea_left_right = 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (left and right), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_left_right = 2 * 24 cm² = 48 cm²\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all the faces together:\nSurface_area = Total_area_top_bottom + Total_area_front_back + Total_area_left_right\nSurface_area = 120 cm² + 80 cm² + 48 cm² = 248 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 248 cm²."
