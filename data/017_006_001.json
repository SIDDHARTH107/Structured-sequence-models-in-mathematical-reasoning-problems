    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has the prime factorization 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are distinct primes. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups of prime power orders. In this case, the group of order 35 is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35. By Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 5 and an element of order 7. Let a ∈ G be an element of order 5 and b ∈ G be an element of order 7. Then, we can form the cyclic subgroups generated by a and b, denoted as ⟨a⟩ and ⟨b⟩, respectively.\n\nSince the orders of a and b are coprime (5 and 7 are prime and distinct), the order of the product ab is the product of the orders of a and b, which is 5 * 7 = 35. Therefore, the subgroup generated by ab, denoted as ⟨ab⟩, is a cyclic group of order 35.\n\nNow, consider the map φ: G → ⟨ab⟩ defined by φ(a^i * b^j) = (ab)^(5j + 7i), where 0 ≤ i < 5 and 0 ≤ j < 7. We will show that φ is an isomorphism between G and ⟨ab⟩.\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since a and b have orders 5 and 7, respectively, any element in G can be uniquely represented as a^i * b^j, where 0 ≤ i < 5 and 0 ≤ j < 7.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let x = a^i * b^j and y = a^m * b^n be elements in G. Then,\n   φ(x * y) = φ(a^(i+m) * b^(j+n)) = (ab)^(5(j+n) + 7(i+m)) = (ab)^(5j + 7i) * (ab)^(5n + 7m) = φ(x) * φ(y).\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(x) = φ(y) for x = a^i * b^j and y = a^m * b^n. Then,\n   (ab)^(5j + 7i) = (ab)^(5n + 7m), which implies 5j + 7i ≡ 5n + 7m (mod 35).\n   Since 5 and 7 are coprime to 35, we can cancel them out, and we get i ≡ m (mod 5) and j ≡ n (mod 7). Thus, x = y, and φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: For any element (ab)^k in ⟨ab⟩, where 0 ≤ k < 35, we can find unique integers i and j such that 0 ≤ i < 5, 0 ≤ j < 7, and 5j + 7i ≡ k (mod 35). Then, φ(a^i * b^j) = (ab)^(5j + 7i) = (ab)^k, which shows that φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism between G and ⟨ab⟩. Therefore, the group of order 35 is cyclic and isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
