    "message_1": "A math student is interested in analyzing the relationship between the scores of five different subjects in their school. They collect data from 50 students and perform a factor analysis to extract underlying factors that can explain the correlation between the subjects. Based on their analysis, they find that two factors can explain most of the variability in the data. The first factor is strongly correlated with Math and Science test scores, while the second factor is strongly correlated with English, History, and Literature test scores. \n\nThe student wants to know the percentage of the variation in the scores that can be explained by each factor. The student performs a Varimax rotation and obtains the following factor loadings:\n\n| Subjects | Factor 1 | Factor 2 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Math | 0.75 | 0.15 |\n| Science | 0.78 | 0.18 |\n| English | 0.20 | 0.75 |\n| History | 0.15 | 0.84 |\n| Literature | 0.11 | 0.85 |\n\nWhat percentage of the variability in the scores can be explained by each factor?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of the variability in the scores explained by each factor, we need to calculate the sum of squared factor loadings for each factor and then divide by the total sum of squared factor loadings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of squared factor loadings for each factor:\n\nFactor 1:\n(0.75^2) + (0.78^2) + (0.20^2) + (0.15^2) + (0.11^2) = 0.5625 + 0.6084 + 0.04 + 0.0225 + 0.0121 = 1.2455\n\nFactor 2:\n(0.15^2) + (0.18^2) + (0.75^2) + (0.84^2) + (0.85^2) = 0.0225 + 0.0324 + 0.5625 + 0.7056 + 0.7225 = 2.0455\n\nNow, let's calculate the total sum of squared factor loadings:\n1.2455 + 2.0455 = 3.291\n\nNow we can calculate the percentage of the variability explained by each factor:\n\nFactor 1:\n(1.2455 / 3.291) * 100 = 37.84%\n\nFactor 2:\n(2.0455 / 3.291) * 100 = 62.16%\n\nSo, Factor 1 explains 37.84% of the variability in the scores, and Factor 2 explains 62.16% of the variability in the scores."
