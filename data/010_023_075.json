    "message_1": "Consider a closed curve in 3-dimensional space represented by a knot. Suppose this knot has a crossing number of 5, which means that the knot crosses over itself 5 times. What is the minimum number of total crossings that this knot can have if it is unknotted, meaning that it can be deformed in 3-dimensional space to a simple closed curve without any self-intersections?",
    "message_2": "If a knot can be unknotted, it is considered to be a trivial knot or an unknot. The minimum number of total crossings for an unknot is 0, as it can be deformed into a simple closed curve without any self-intersections."
