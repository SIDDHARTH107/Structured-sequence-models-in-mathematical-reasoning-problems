    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to test the effect of four factors (A, B, C, and D) on the strength of a product. Each factor has two levels (high and low). Assuming that the interaction between any two factors is negligible, how many different product configurations should the manufacturer test using orthogonal arrays?\n\n(Note: A full factorial design would require testing 2^4 = 16 different product configurations, but the use of orthogonal arrays allows for fewer tests while still achieving the same level of information.)",
    "message_2": "To test the effect of four factors (A, B, C, and D) with two levels each (high and low) using orthogonal arrays, the manufacturer can use a L8 orthogonal array. This array allows for testing 8 different product configurations while still achieving the same level of information as a full factorial design. The L8 orthogonal array is a more efficient method than the full factorial design, which would require testing 16 different product configurations."
