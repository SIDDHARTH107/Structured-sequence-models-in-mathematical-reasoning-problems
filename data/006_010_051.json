    "message_1": "What is the probability that among a population of 500 individuals, 25% of whom are smokers, at least 10% of the smokers will be affected by a particular respiratory disease? The prevalence of the disease among non-smokers is 2%.",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. There are 500 individuals in the population.\n2. 25% of them are smokers, which means there are 0.25 * 500 = 125 smokers.\n3. We want to find the probability that at least 10% of the smokers will be affected by the respiratory disease.\n\nLet's assume the prevalence of the disease among smokers is x%. We are not given this information, so we cannot directly calculate the probability. However, we can set up an equation to help us understand the problem better.\n\nLet A be the event that a smoker is affected by the disease, and B be the event that a non-smoker is affected by the disease. We are given that P(B) = 0.02 (2% prevalence among non-smokers).\n\nWe want to find P(at least 10% of smokers are affected), which can be written as P(A) â‰¥ 0.10.\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the prevalence of the disease among smokers (x%), we cannot directly calculate the probability. If more information was provided about the prevalence of the disease among smokers or the correlation between smoking and the disease, we could solve the problem."
