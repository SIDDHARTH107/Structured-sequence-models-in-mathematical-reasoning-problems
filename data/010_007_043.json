    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the unit circle $X$ with respect to the covering space given by the map $p: \\mathbb{C} -\\{0\\} \\rightarrow X$, we will use the fact that the fundamental group of the unit circle is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations of the covering space.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of a deck transformation. A deck transformation is a homeomorphism $f: \\mathbb{C} -\\{0\\} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C} -\\{0\\}$ such that $p \\circ f = p$. In other words, a deck transformation is a map that preserves the fibers of the covering map.\n\nNow, let's consider the map $f_n(z) = z \\cdot e^{2\\pi i n}$ for some integer $n$. This map is a homeomorphism from $\\mathbb{C} -\\{0\\}$ to itself, and we have:\n\n$$p(f_n(z)) = p(z \\cdot e^{2\\pi i n}) = \\frac{z \\cdot e^{2\\pi i n}}{|z \\cdot e^{2\\pi i n}|} = \\frac{z}{|z|} = p(z).$$\n\nSo, $f_n$ is a deck transformation for every integer $n$. Moreover, it is easy to see that every deck transformation must be of this form, since any deck transformation must preserve the argument of $z$ up to a multiple of $2\\pi$.\n\nNow, let's consider the group of deck transformations under composition. This group is isomorphic to the additive group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, since the composition of two deck transformations $f_n$ and $f_m$ is given by $f_n \\circ f_m = f_{n+m}$.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that the fundamental group of the unit circle $X$ with respect to the covering space given by the map $p: \\mathbb{C} -\\{0\\} \\rightarrow X$ is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations, which is the additive group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$."
