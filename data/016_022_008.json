    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal that is constructed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of triangles needed to construct each stage can be found using the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the stage number.\n\nFor the 4th stage:\n\nTotal triangles = (4^4 - 1) / 3\nTotal triangles = (256 - 1) / 3\nTotal triangles = 255 / 3\nTotal triangles = 85\n\nSo, 85 triangles are needed to construct the 4th stage of the Sierpinski pyramid."
