    "message_1": "A toy company produces a popular puzzle that costs them $5 to make. They sell the puzzle at a wholesale price of $10. If they increase the price by $2, they will sell 500 puzzles less each month. Determine the optimal price they should sell the puzzle for to maximize their revenue.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of $2 increases in price, and let P be the number of puzzles sold each month at the current price of $10. Then, the revenue R can be represented as:\n\nR = (10 + 2x)(P - 500x)\n\nWe want to find the value of x that maximizes R. To do this, we can take the derivative of R with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndR/dx = (2)(P - 500x) - (10 + 2x)(500) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2P - 1000x - 5000 - 1000x = 0\n2P - 2000x = 5000\nx = (2P - 5000) / 2000\n\nSince x represents the number of $2 increases in price, it should be a whole number. We don't have the information about the initial number of puzzles sold (P), so we cannot find the exact value of x. However, we can express the optimal price as a function of P:\n\nOptimal price = 10 + 2x = 10 + 2((2P - 5000) / 2000)\n\nThis equation shows that the optimal price depends on the initial number of puzzles sold (P). The company should analyze their sales data to find the value of P and then use this equation to determine the optimal price for maximizing their revenue."
