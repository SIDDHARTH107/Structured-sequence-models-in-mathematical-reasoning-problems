    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski sieve, each iteration removes a certain number of triangles, creating empty spaces. In this case, each triangle is divided into 9 congruent sub-triangles, and the middle one is removed, leaving 8 filled triangles.\n\nLet's denote the number of empty spaces at the nth iteration as E(n). We can see that:\n\nE(0) = 0 (no empty spaces in the initial triangle)\nE(1) = 1 (one empty space after the first iteration)\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the number of empty spaces is multiplied by 9 and added to the previous number of empty spaces:\n\nE(n) = 9 * E(n-1) + E(n-2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of empty spaces for the 5th iteration:\n\nE(2) = 9 * E(1) + E(0) = 9 * 1 + 0 = 9\nE(3) = 9 * E(2) + E(1) = 9 * 9 + 1 = 82\nE(4) = 9 * E(3) + E(2) = 9 * 82 + 9 = 747\nE(5) = 9 * E(4) + E(3) = 9 * 747 + 82 = 6745\n\nSo, there are 6745 empty spaces in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski sieve when each smaller triangle is divided into 9 congruent sub-triangles."
