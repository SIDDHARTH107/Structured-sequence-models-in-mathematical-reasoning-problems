    "message_2": "To solve the inequality x - 2 < 8, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 2 to both sides of the inequality.\nx - 2 + 2 < 8 + 2\nx < 10\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x < 10.\n\nTo graph the inequality on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with 10 as a reference point.\n2. Since x is less than 10, place an open circle at 10 (an open circle indicates that the value 10 is not included in the solution).\n3. Shade the region to the left of the open circle, indicating that all values less than 10 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph of the inequality x < 10 will have an open circle at 10 and the region to the left of the circle shaded."
