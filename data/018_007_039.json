    "message_2": "To prove that the power set of A is larger than the set A itself, we will count the number of elements in each set.\n\nSet A has 3 elements: {1, 2, 3}.\n\nThe power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. Let's list all the subsets of A:\n\n1. The empty set: {}\n2. Single-element subsets: {1}, {2}, {3}\n3. Two-element subsets: {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}\n4. The set A itself: {1, 2, 3}\n\nSo, the power set of A, P(A), has 8 elements: { {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} }.\n\nComparing the number of elements in each set, we can see that the power set of A (P(A)) has 8 elements, while the set A itself has only 3 elements. Therefore, the power set of A is larger than the set A itself."
