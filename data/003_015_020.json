    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given function y = 3sin(4x + π/2), we need to analyze the function and compare it to the general form of a sine function, which is y = A*sin(Bx + C).\n\nIn this case, A = 3, B = 4, and C = π/2.\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which determines the peak value of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sine function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. The period of a sine function is given by the formula P = 2π/|B|. In this case, B = 4, so the period is P = 2π/|4| = π/2.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the given function is 3, and the period is π/2."
