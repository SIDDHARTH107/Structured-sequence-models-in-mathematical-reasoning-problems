    "message_1": "Sorry, I cannot provide a precise numerical problem for Deontic logic as it deals with normative concepts and not numbers. Deontic logic is a branch of logic which deals with the concepts of permission, obligation, and prohibition. It is used to reason about what actions are permitted, required, or forbidden in a certain situation. A sample question related to Deontic logic could be: If it is permissible for a student to cheat in exams, what actions follow from this permission? Can cheating be required or forbidden?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can provide an analysis of the given deontic logic scenario:\n\nGiven: It is permissible for a student to cheat in exams.\n\nLet P(C) represent the permission to cheat, where C is the act of cheating.\n\nFrom the given information, we have P(C).\n\nNow, we need to analyze the following questions:\n\n1. Can cheating be required?\n2. Can cheating be forbidden?\n\n1. Can cheating be required?\n\nTo analyze this, we need to consider the concept of obligation. Let O(C) represent the obligation to cheat.\n\nIf cheating is required, then O(C) would be true. However, we only have information about the permission to cheat, not the obligation. Therefore, we cannot conclude that cheating is required based on the given information.\n\n2. Can cheating be forbidden?\n\nTo analyze this, we need to consider the concept of prohibition. Let F(C) represent the prohibition of cheating.\n\nIf cheating is forbidden, then F(C) would be true. However, since we are given that cheating is permissible (P(C)), this directly contradicts the idea of cheating being forbidden. Therefore, cheating cannot be forbidden based on the given information.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information that it is permissible for a student to cheat in exams, we cannot conclude that cheating is required, and we can conclude that cheating is not forbidden."
