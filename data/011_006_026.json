    "message_2": "Since there are 5 different colors and 10 regions to be painted, each color can be used to paint any of the 10 regions. Therefore, for each region, there are 5 choices of colors. Since there are 10 regions, the total number of ways to paint the picture is:\n\n5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5^10 = 9,765,625 ways."
