    "message_1": "A farmer has 200 acres of land available to grow two crops: corn and wheat. The farmer needs to allocate the land between the two crops to maximize profit. The farmer can earn $200 profit per acre of corn and $300 profit per acre of wheat. The production of corn requires 2 hours of labor per acre and 3 hours of equipment use per acre, while the production of wheat requires 1 hour of labor per acre and 4 hours of equipment use per acre. The farmer has 1,000 hours of labor available and 1,500 hours of equipment use available. How many acres of corn and wheat should the farmer plant to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn and y be the number of acres of wheat. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 200x + 300y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (total acres)\n2. 2x + y ≤ 1000 (labor constraint)\n3. 3x + 4y ≤ 1500 (equipment constraint)\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. y ≤ 200 - x\n2. y ≤ 1000 - 2x\n3. y ≤ (1500 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by pairs of constraint inequalities:\n\nVertex 1: Intersection of constraints 1 and 2:\nx + y = 200\n2x + y = 1000\nSolving this system, we get x = 200 and y = 0.\n\nVertex 2: Intersection of constraints 1 and 3:\nx + y = 200\n3x + 4y = 1500\nSolving this system, we get x = 100 and y = 100.\n\nVertex 3: Intersection of constraints 2 and 3:\n2x + y = 1000\n3x + 4y = 1500\nSolving this system, we get x = 150 and y = 50.\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(200, 0) = 200(200) + 300(0) = 40,000\nP(100, 100) = 200(100) + 300(100) = 50,000\nP(150, 50) = 200(150) + 300(50) = 45,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $50,000, which occurs when the farmer plants 100 acres of corn and 100 acres of wheat."
