    "message_2": "To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a Safe prime, we need to find a prime number p such that both p and 2p + 1 are prime, and 2p + 1 can be written in the form 2q + 1, where q is also a prime number.\n\nLet's start with the smallest prime number, 2:\n- p = 2, 2p + 1 = 5 (prime)\n- However, 5 cannot be written in the form 2q + 1, where q is a prime number.\n\nNext, let's try p = 3:\n- p = 3, 2p + 1 = 7 (prime)\n- 7 can be written in the form 2q + 1, where q = 3 (prime)\n\nThus, the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a Safe prime is 3."
