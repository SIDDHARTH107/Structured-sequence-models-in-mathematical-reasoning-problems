    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will first analyze the possible structures of G and then find the multiplication table of G. Finally, we will identify the group's properties that satisfy the conditions of either C6 or D3.\n\nSince G has order 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Let's analyze the possible structures of G:\n\n1. If G has an element of order 6, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C6.\n2. If G has no element of order 6, then G must have elements of orders 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's consider the second case. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3 in G. Then, G = {e, a, b, b^2, x, y}, where e is the identity element, x and y are the remaining elements, and a â‰  b^2 since a has order 2 and b^2 has order 3.\n\nNow, let's find the multiplication table of G:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  b^2  x  y\n-------------------------\n e | e  a  b  b^2  x  y\n a | a  e  x  y   b  b^2\n b | b  x  b^2 e   y  a\nb^2 | b^2 y  e  b   a  x\n x | x  b  y  a  b^2 e\n y | y  b^2 a  x  e  b\n```\n\nWe know that a^2 = e, b^3 = e, and (ab)^2 = e. Thus, x = ab and y = ab^2. Now, let's compute the remaining products:\n\n- ax = a(ab) = ab^2 = y\n- ay = a(ab^2) = ab = x\n- bx = b(ab) = ba^2b = bab = b^2y (since (ab)^2 = e)\n- by = b(ab^2) = ba^3b^2 = bab^2 = b^2x (since (ab)^2 = e)\n- b^2x = b^2(ab) = b^3a = a\n- b^2y = b^2(ab^2) = b^3ab = ab = x\n\nNow, the multiplication table of G is:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  b^2  x  y\n-------------------------\n e | e  a  b  b^2  x  y\n a | a  e  x  y   b  b^2\n b | b  x  b^2 e   y  a\nb^2 | b^2 y  e  b   a  x\n x | x  b  y  a  b^2 e\n y | y  b^2 a  x  e  b\n```\n\nThis multiplication table corresponds to the dihedral group D3, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle, including rotations and reflections. The elements a and b represent a reflection and a rotation, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 if it has an element of order 6 or the dihedral group D3 if it has no element of order 6. We have shown the multiplication table of G and identified the group's properties that satisfy the conditions of D3."
