    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve construction to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side of the triangle is multiplied by 4/3, as each side is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original side.\n\nAfter four iterations, the length of each side will be multiplied by (4/3)^4. Given that the initial segment length is 1 unit, the length of each side after four iterations will be:\n\n(4/3)^4 = 256/81\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, all three sides have the same length. Therefore, the total length of the Koch island after four iterations will be:\n\n3 * (256/81) = 768/81 â‰ˆ 9.4815 units."
