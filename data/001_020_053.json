    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the graph, we need to find the values of x when y = 0. So, we will set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = |x + 3| - 2\n\nNow, we need to consider two cases: when (x + 3) is positive and when (x + 3) is negative.\n\nCase 1: (x + 3) is positive or non-negative (x + 3 â‰¥ 0)\nIn this case, |x + 3| = x + 3. So, our equation becomes:\n\n0 = (x + 3) - 2\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n2 = x + 3\nx = -1\n\nCase 2: (x + 3) is negative (x + 3 < 0)\nIn this case, |x + 3| = -(x + 3). So, our equation becomes:\n\n0 = -(x + 3) - 2\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n2 = -(x + 3)\n-2 = x + 3\nx = -5\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the graph are x = -1 and x = -5."
