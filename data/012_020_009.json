    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. In other words, it's a bijective function from the set of vertices to itself such that if two vertices are adjacent, their images under the function are also adjacent.\n\nFor the complete graph K<sub>5</sub>, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, any permutation of the vertices will preserve the adjacency relation, as every vertex will still be connected to every other vertex after the permutation.\n\nThere are 5 vertices in K<sub>5</sub>, so there are 5! (5 factorial) possible permutations of the vertices. Therefore, there are 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 automorphisms of K<sub>5</sub>."
