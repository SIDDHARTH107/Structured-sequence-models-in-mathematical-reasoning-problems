    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE). Let's first consider the number of ways to divide the set into 3 subsets without the non-empty condition. We can represent each subset by a binary string of length 6, where the i-th digit is 1 if the i-th letter is in the subset and 0 otherwise. For example, the string 110000 represents the subset {A, B}.\n\nThere are 3 choices for each of the 6 letters (they can go to subset 1, subset 2, or subset 3), so there are 3^6 ways to divide the set into 3 subsets. However, this count includes cases where one or more of the subsets are empty, which we need to exclude.\n\nThere are 3 ways to have one empty subset (either subset 1, subset 2, or subset 3 is empty). In this case, there are 2 choices for each of the 6 letters (they can go to one of the two non-empty subsets), so there are 3 * 2^6 ways to have one empty subset.\n\nThere is 1 way to have two empty subsets (all letters go to the same subset). In this case, there is only 1 choice for each of the 6 letters (they all go to the non-empty subset), so there is 1 * 1^6 = 1 way to have two empty subsets.\n\nBy PIE, the number of ways to divide the set into 3 non-empty subsets is:\n\n3^6 - 3 * 2^6 + 1 = 729 - 192 + 1 = 538.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the order of the subsets matters. There are 3! = 6 ways to order the subsets. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n538 * 6 = 3228 ways to divide the set into 3 non-empty subsets with the order of subsets mattering."
