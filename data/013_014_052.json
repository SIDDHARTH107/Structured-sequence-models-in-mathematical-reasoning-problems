    "message_1": "Suppose there are 3 players who are participating in an auction. Each player privately knows his/her own valuation for the item being auctioned, which are given by $v_1=10$, $v_2=15$, and $v_3=20$. Design a mechanism to allocate the item among the players that maximizes the auctioneer's revenue, and compute the expected revenue of the auctioneer using the mechanism you designed.",
    "message_2": "One mechanism that can be used to maximize the auctioneer's revenue is the second-price sealed-bid auction, also known as the Vickrey auction. In this auction, each player submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the item but pays the second-highest bid price.\n\nLet's compute the expected revenue of the auctioneer using this mechanism. Since the valuations are known, we can list all possible bid combinations and their corresponding revenues for the auctioneer:\n\n1. Player 1 bids 10, Player 2 bids 15, Player 3 bids 20: Player 3 wins and pays 15.\n2. Player 1 bids 10, Player 2 bids 20, Player 3 bids 15: Player 2 wins and pays 15.\n3. Player 1 bids 15, Player 2 bids 10, Player 3 bids 20: Player 3 wins and pays 15.\n4. Player 1 bids 15, Player 2 bids 20, Player 3 bids 10: Player 2 wins and pays 15.\n5. Player 1 bids 20, Player 2 bids 10, Player 3 bids 15: Player 1 wins and pays 15.\n6. Player 1 bids 20, Player 2 bids 15, Player 3 bids 10: Player 1 wins and pays 15.\n\nIn all possible bid combinations, the auctioneer's revenue is 15. Therefore, the expected revenue of the auctioneer using the second-price sealed-bid auction mechanism is 15."
