    "message_2": "To find the Morse inequalities for the function f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy over the domain D = {(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 ≤ 1}, we first need to find the critical points of the function. The critical points are the points where the gradient of the function is zero or undefined. The gradient of f(x, y) is given by:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3y = 0\n3y^2 - 3x = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\nx^2 - y = 0\ny^2 - x = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get two critical points: (0, 0) and (1, 1).\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points as local minima, local maxima, or saddle points. To do this, we can use the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second-order partial derivatives:\n\nH(f) = | ∂^2f/∂x^2  ∂^2f/∂x∂y |\n          | ∂^2f/∂y∂x  ∂^2f/∂y^2 |\n\nLet's compute the second-order partial derivatives:\n\n∂^2f/∂x^2 = 6x\n∂^2f/∂x∂y = -3\n∂^2f/∂y∂x = -3\n∂^2f/∂y^2 = 6y\n\nSo, the Hessian matrix is:\n\nH(f) = | 6x  -3  |\n          | -3   6y |\n\nNow, we need to compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\ndet(H(f)) = (6x)(6y) - (-3)(-3) = 36xy - 9\n\nFor the critical point (0, 0), the determinant is:\n\ndet(H(0, 0)) = 36(0)(0) - 9 = -9\n\nSince the determinant is negative, the critical point (0, 0) is a saddle point.\n\nFor the critical point (1, 1), the determinant is:\n\ndet(H(1, 1)) = 36(1)(1) - 9 = 27\n\nSince the determinant is positive and the second-order partial derivative with respect to x is positive (∂^2f/∂x^2 = 6 > 0), the critical point (1, 1) is a local minimum.\n\nNow, we can state the Morse inequalities for the function f(x, y) over the domain D:\n\n1. The number of local minima is greater than or equal to 1.\n2. The number of saddle points is greater than or equal to 1.\n3. The number of local maxima is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nTo prove the validity of these inequalities, we can use the fact that the function f(x, y) is continuous and differentiable over the domain D, and we have found at least one local minimum and one saddle point. Since the domain D is compact (closed and bounded), the function f(x, y) must attain a global minimum and a global maximum over D. The global minimum must be a local minimum, so there is at least one local minimum. The saddle point we found shows that there is at least one saddle point. We have not found any local maxima, but the inequality only requires that there be at least zero local maxima, which is true. Therefore, the Morse inequalities hold for the function f(x, y) over the domain D."
