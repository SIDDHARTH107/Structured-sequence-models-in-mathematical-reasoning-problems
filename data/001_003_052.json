    "message_2": "First, we can solve the first equation for x in terms of y:\n\n2x + 3y = 17\n\n2x = 17 - 3y\n\nx = (17 - 3y) / 2\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n4x - 5y = -19\n\n4((17 - 3y) / 2) - 5y = -19\n\n2(17 - 3y) - 5y = -19\n\n34 - 6y - 5y = -19\n\n-11y = -53\n\ny = 53 / 11\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression for x:\n\nx = (17 - 3y) / 2\n\nx = (17 - 3(53 / 11)) / 2\n\nx = (17 - 159 / 11) / 2\n\nx = (28 / 11) / 2\n\nx = 14 / 11\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 14/11 and y = 53/11."
