    "message_2": "To find the angle between the direction of the plane and the direction of the resulting velocity, we can use vector addition and trigonometry. \n\nSince the plane is flying due east, its velocity vector can be represented as (400, 0). The wind is blowing from the north-west, which means it has both north and west components. Since the wind is blowing at a 45-degree angle, we can find the north and west components using the following equations:\n\nNorth component = 50 * sin(45) = 50 * (√2 / 2) = 25√2\nWest component = 50 * cos(45) = 50 * (√2 / 2) = 25√2\n\nSo, the wind velocity vector can be represented as (-25√2, 25√2).\n\nNow, we can find the resulting velocity vector by adding the plane's velocity vector and the wind velocity vector:\n\nResulting velocity vector = (400 - 25√2, 0 + 25√2)\n\nNext, we can find the magnitude of the resulting velocity vector:\n\nMagnitude = √((400 - 25√2)^2 + (25√2)^2)\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the direction of the plane and the direction of the resulting velocity using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||)\n\nwhere A is the plane's velocity vector (400, 0), B is the resulting velocity vector (400 - 25√2, 25√2), and θ is the angle between them.\n\ncos(θ) = ((400 * (400 - 25√2)) + (0 * 25√2)) / (400 * Magnitude)\n\nθ = arccos(cos(θ))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the angle:\n\nθ = arccos(((400 * (400 - 25√2)) + (0 * 25√2)) / (400 * √((400 - 25√2)^2 + (25√2)^2)))\n\nθ ≈ 3.58 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the direction of the plane and the direction of the resulting velocity is approximately 3.58 degrees."
