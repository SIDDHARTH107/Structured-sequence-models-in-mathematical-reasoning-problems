    "message_1": "A company has reported that historically, 25% of their orders are delivered within 2 days. What is the probability that out of 10 new orders received by the company, exactly 3 orders will be delivered within 2 days?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an order being delivered within 2 days)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of orders)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of orders delivered within 2 days)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 10 (10 new orders)\n- k = 3 (exactly 3 orders delivered within 2 days)\n- p = 0.25 (25% probability of an order being delivered within 2 days)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate nCk (10C3):\n\n10C3 = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n= 10! / (3!7!)\n= (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(7*6*5*4*3*2*1))\n= (10*9*8) / (3*2*1)\n= 720 / 6\n= 120\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = (120) * (0.25^3) * (1-0.25)^(10-3)\n= 120 * (0.015625) * (0.75^7)\n= 120 * 0.015625 * 0.13348388671875\n= 0.03125 * 0.13348388671875\nâ‰ˆ 0.2493\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 out of 10 new orders will be delivered within 2 days is approximately 0.2493 or 24.93%."
