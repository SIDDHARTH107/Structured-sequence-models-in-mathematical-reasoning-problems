    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total curvature K of a closed surface S is given by:\n\nK = 2πχ(S),\n\nwhere χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface S.\n\nFor a sphere, the Euler characteristic χ(S) is 2. Therefore, the total curvature K of the sphere S with radius 5 is:\n\nK = 2π(2) = 4π.\n\nSo, the total curvature K of the sphere S with radius 5 is 4π."
