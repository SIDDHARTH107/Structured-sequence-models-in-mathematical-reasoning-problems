Here's a numerical problem for them to solve:\n\nConsider the curve C given by the equation: y^2 = x^3 - 4x. Let P = (2, 2) and Q = (-2,-2) be two points on the curve C. Find the value of the theta function θ[ M ](P - Q) for M on the Jacobian of C.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of the theta function θ[M](P - Q) for M on the Jacobian of C, we first need to find the sum of the points P and Q on the curve C. \n\nThe curve C is an elliptic curve, and the sum of two points on an elliptic curve can be found using the group law for elliptic curves. Let R = P + Q. To find the coordinates of R, we need to find the slope of the line passing through P and Q, and then use this slope to find the x-coordinate of R. Finally, we can find the y-coordinate of R using the equation of the curve.\n\n1. Find the slope of the line passing through P and Q:\n\nSince P and Q have the same y-coordinate, the line passing through them is a vertical line, and its slope is undefined. In this case, we can use the tangent line at P (or Q) to find the slope.\n\nThe equation of the curve C is y^2 = x^3 - 4x. Differentiate this equation with respect to x to find the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = 3x^2 - 4\n(dy/dx) = (3x^2 - 4) / (2y)\n\nNow, plug in the coordinates of P (or Q) to find the slope of the tangent line at P:\n\n(dy/dx) = (3(2)^2 - 4) / (2(2)) = (12 - 4) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2\n\n2. Find the x-coordinate of R:\n\nThe equation of the tangent line at P is given by:\n\ny - 2 = 2(x - 2)\n\nNow, substitute the equation of the curve C into the equation of the tangent line to find the x-coordinate of R:\n\n(2(x - 2))^2 = x^3 - 4x\n\n4(x^2 - 4x + 4) = x^3 - 4x\n\n4x^2 - 16x + 16 = x^3 - 4x\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 + 12x - 16 = 0\n\nBy trying integer values for x, we find that x = 4 is a solution:\n\n(4)^3 - 4(4)^2 + 12(4) - 16 = 0\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of R is 4.\n\n3. Find the y-coordinate of R:\n\nNow, plug the x-coordinate of R into the equation of the curve C to find the y-coordinate of R:\n\ny^2 = (4)^3 - 4(4) = 64 - 16 = 48\n\ny = ±√48\n\nSince R is the sum of P and Q, and P and Q have the same y-coordinate, R must have the opposite y-coordinate. Therefore, the y-coordinate of R is -√48.\n\nSo, R = (4, -√48).\n\n4. Find the value of the theta function θ[M](P - Q):\n\nNow that we have the coordinates of R, we can find the value of the theta function θ[M](P - Q) for M on the Jacobian of C. However, the theta function is a complex-valued function that depends on the choice of a lattice and a complex parameter τ. Without more information about the specific theta function being used and the value of M, we cannot compute the value of θ[M](P - Q)."
