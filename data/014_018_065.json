    "message_1": "Suppose an encrypted message using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher has the frequency distribution of letters as follows: \n\nA: 4, B: 1, C: 2, D: 5, E: 10, F: 3, G: 2, H: 6, I: 8, J: 1, K: 0, L: 4, M: 2, N: 7, O: 6, P: 2, Q: 1, R: 7, S: 6, T: 9, U: 1, V: 2, W: 0, X: 0, Y: 2, Z: 0.\n\nUse frequency analysis to determine the plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "To perform frequency analysis on this encrypted message, we need to compare the given frequency distribution with the typical frequency distribution of letters in the English language. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D, in that order.\n\nNow, let's arrange the given frequency distribution in descending order:\n\nE: 10, T: 9, I: 8, N: 7, R: 7, H: 6, O: 6, S: 6, A: 4, L: 4, D: 5, F: 3, C: 2, G: 2, M: 2, P: 2, V: 2, Y: 2, B: 1, J: 1, Q: 1, U: 1, K: 0, W: 0, X: 0, Z: 0.\n\nNow, we can try to match the most frequent letters in the encrypted message with the most frequent letters in the English language. However, it's important to note that frequency analysis is not always perfect, and there might be some trial and error involved. Here's a possible mapping based on the frequency analysis:\n\nE -> E, T -> T, I -> A, N -> O, R -> I, H -> N, O -> S, S -> H, A -> R, L -> D, D -> L, F -> U, C -> C, G -> M, M -> W, P -> F, V -> G, Y -> Y, B -> P, J -> K, Q -> V, U -> B, K -> X, W -> J, X -> Q, Z -> Z.\n\nUsing this mapping, we can attempt to decrypt the message. However, without the actual encrypted message, we cannot provide the plaintext message. You can use the mapping provided to decrypt the message you have. Keep in mind that the mapping might not be perfect, and you may need to adjust some letters based on context and trial and error."
