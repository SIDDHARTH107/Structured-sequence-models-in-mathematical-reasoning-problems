    "message_1": "Consider the polynomial expression f(x,y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2x - 2y. Let G be the subgroup of rotational symmetries of the unit circle, i.e., G = {1, -1}, where 1 is the identity and -1 is the reflection through the x-axis. Determine the set of points (x,y) in the xy-plane that are fixed by the group G, i.e., G(x,y) = (x,y).",
    "message_2": "To find the set of points (x, y) in the xy-plane that are fixed by the group G, we need to find the points that remain unchanged under the action of the elements of G. In this case, the elements of G are 1 (the identity) and -1 (reflection through the x-axis).\n\n1. For the identity element (1), all points in the xy-plane are fixed, since the identity element does not change the points.\n\n2. For the reflection through the x-axis (-1), we need to find the points (x, y) that remain unchanged when reflected through the x-axis. This means that the y-coordinate of the point should be 0, as the reflection through the x-axis only changes the sign of the y-coordinate. So, we are looking for points of the form (x, 0).\n\nNow, we need to find the points that satisfy both conditions. Since all points are fixed by the identity element, we only need to consider the points that are fixed by the reflection through the x-axis. These points are of the form (x, 0).\n\nLet's substitute y = 0 into the polynomial expression f(x, y) and see what we get:\n\nf(x, 0) = x^2 + 2x(0) + (0)^2 - 2x - 2(0) = x^2 - 2x\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, 0) that are fixed by the group G. Since these points are fixed by the reflection through the x-axis, they must satisfy f(x, 0) = x^2 - 2x = 0. Solving this equation for x, we get:\n\nx(x - 2) = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: x = 0 and x = 2. Therefore, the set of points (x, y) in the xy-plane that are fixed by the group G is:\n\n{(0, 0), (2, 0)}"
