    "message_2": "Since f(z) is an entire function, it can be represented by a power series:\n\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + ...\n\nWe are given that |f(z)| ≤ 3|z|^2 for all z in the complex plane. Let's consider the function g(z) = f(z)/z^2. Then, we have:\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z)/z^2| ≤ 3\n\nNow, let's find the limit of g(z) as z approaches 0:\n\nlim (z -> 0) g(z) = lim (z -> 0) (a_0/z^2 + a_1/z + a_2 + a_3z + ...)\n\nSince g(z) is bounded, the limit exists. However, the only way for the limit to exist is if a_0 = a_1 = 0, because otherwise, the terms a_0/z^2 and a_1/z would go to infinity as z approaches 0.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf(z) = a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + ...\n\nNow, to find the value of f(0), we simply plug in z = 0:\n\nf(0) = a_2(0)^2 + a_3(0)^3 + ... = 0\n\nTherefore, f(0) = 0."
