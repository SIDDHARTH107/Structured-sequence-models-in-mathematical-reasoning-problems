The distances between the cities are given below:\n\nCity A to City B: 6 miles\nCity A to City C: 3 miles\nCity A to City D: 9 miles\nCity A to City E: 8 miles\nCity A to City F: 10 miles\nCity B to City C: 2 miles\nCity B to City D: 4 miles\nCity B to City E: 5 miles\nCity B to City F: 7 miles\nCity C to City D: 6 miles\nCity C to City E: 8 miles\nCity C to City F: 9 miles\nCity D to City E: 2 miles\nCity D to City F: 5 miles\nCity E to City F: 3 miles\n\nWhat is the optimal route that the salesman should take to minimize the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "Since the salesman needs to visit the cities in a fixed order, we can simply add the distances between each consecutive city pair to find the total distance traveled. The order is City A to City B to City C to City D to City E to City F.\n\nTotal distance = (City A to City B) + (City B to City C) + (City C to City D) + (City D to City E) + (City E to City F)\nTotal distance = 6 miles + 2 miles + 6 miles + 2 miles + 3 miles = 19 miles\n\nThe optimal route for the salesman to minimize the total distance traveled is to follow the fixed order: City A → City B → City C → City D → City E → City F, with a total distance of 19 miles."
