    "message_2": "To find the expected change in the price of the stock, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding change in price and then add them together.\n\nExpected change = (Probability of increase * Increase in price) + (Probability of decrease * Decrease in price)\n\nExpected change = (0.30 * $5) + (0.70 * -$3)\n\nExpected change = ($1.50) + (-$2.10)\n\nExpected change = -$0.60\n\nThe expected change in the price of the stock is a decrease of $0.60."
