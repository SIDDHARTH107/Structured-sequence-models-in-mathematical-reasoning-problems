    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The value in the nth row and kth column can be found using the combination formula:\n\nC(n-1, k-1) = (n-1)! / [(k-1)! * (n-k)!]\n\nFor the sixth row and fourth column, we have n = 6 and k = 4:\n\nC(6-1, 4-1) = C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 20\n\nSo, the value in the sixth row and fourth column of Pascal's triangle is 20."
