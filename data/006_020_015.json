    "message_1": "In a certain community, 25% of the households have pets and 60% of the households have children. If it is known that 15% of the households have both pets and children, what is the probability that a randomly selected household has pets or children or both?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected household has pets or children or both, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A represents the event of having pets, B represents the event of having children, and A ∩ B represents the event of having both pets and children.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\nP(A) = 25% (probability of having pets)\nP(B) = 60% (probability of having children)\nP(A ∩ B) = 15% (probability of having both pets and children)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\nP(A ∪ B) = 25% + 60% - 15%\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 70%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected household has pets or children or both is 70%."
