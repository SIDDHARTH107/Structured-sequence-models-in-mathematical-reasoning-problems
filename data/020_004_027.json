    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products P1, and P2. The P1 product requires 3 units of raw material A and 4 units of raw material B, while P2 requires 5 units of raw material A and 2 units of raw material B. The company has 240 units of raw material A and 200 units of raw material B available for production. The profit per unit for P1 is $10 and for P2 is $15. \n\nFormulate and solve a quadratic programming problem to determine the optimal production quantities of P1 and P2 to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "To formulate the problem, we need to define the variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nLet x1 be the number of units of product P1 produced and x2 be the number of units of product P2 produced.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized):\nProfit = 10x1 + 15x2\n\nConstraints (raw material availability):\n3x1 + 5x2 ≤ 240 (raw material A constraint)\n4x1 + 2x2 ≤ 200 (raw material B constraint)\nx1 ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for P1)\nx2 ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for P2)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x1 + 5x2 ≤ 240\n   x2 ≤ (240 - 3x1) / 5\n\n2. 4x1 + 2x2 ≤ 200\n   x2 ≤ (200 - 4x1) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. Plotting these inequalities on a graph, we find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 48)\nC(40, 20)\nD(60, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nA(0, 0): Profit = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nB(0, 48): Profit = 10(0) + 15(48) = $720\nC(40, 20): Profit = 10(40) + 15(20) = $700\nD(60, 0): Profit = 10(60) + 15(0) = $600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B(0, 48) with a profit of $720. Therefore, the optimal production quantities are 0 units of product P1 and 48 units of product P2."
