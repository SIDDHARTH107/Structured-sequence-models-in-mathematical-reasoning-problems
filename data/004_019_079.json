    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the velocity function $v(t)$.\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(2t^3 - 6t^2 + 10t - 12)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 6t^2 - 12t + 10$\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at $t = 3$ seconds:\n\n$v(3) = 6(3)^2 - 12(3) + 10 = 6(9) - 36 + 10 = 54 - 36 + 10 = 28$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t = 3$ seconds is 28 meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we need to find the second derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the acceleration function $a(t)$.\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t^2 - 12t + 10)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 12t - 12$\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at $t = 3$ seconds:\n\n$a(3) = 12(3) - 12 = 36 - 12 = 24$\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at $t = 3$ seconds is 24 meters per second squared.\n\nIn conclusion, the velocity of the car at $t = 3$ seconds is 28 meters per second, and the acceleration is 24 meters per second squared."
