    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4 with elements e, a, b, and c. We know that e is the identity element of the group. We will consider two cases to show that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4.\n\nCase 1: There exists an element of order 4 in G.\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume that the element a has order 4. Then, the powers of a are distinct and generate the group G:\na^0 = e, a^1 = a, a^2 = b, a^3 = c, a^4 = e.\n\nThis shows that G is a cyclic group generated by a, and thus G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: There is no element of order 4 in G.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. This means that for all x in {a, b, c}, x^2 = e. We can now show that G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nLet's consider the product of two non-identity elements, say ab. Since a^2 = b^2 = e, we have (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ee = e. This means that ab must be either the identity element e or the remaining element c. However, ab cannot be e, because that would imply that a = b^(-1) = b, which contradicts our assumption that a and b are distinct non-identity elements. Therefore, ab = c.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that ac = b and bc = a. The group operation table for G is then:\n\n  | e  a  b  c\n--+-----------\ne | e  a  b  c\na | a  e  c  b\nb | b  c  e  a\nc | c  b  a  e\n\nThis operation table is identical to the operation table for the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
