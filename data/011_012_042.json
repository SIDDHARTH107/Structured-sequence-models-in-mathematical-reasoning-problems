    "message_1": "A school has 60 students, 35 of whom play basketball, 25 play soccer, and 15 play both sports. \n\nHow many students neither play basketball nor soccer?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the number of students who play basketball, B be the number of students who play soccer, and C be the number of students who play both sports. We are given:\n\nA = 35\nB = 25\nC = 15\n\nWe want to find the number of students who neither play basketball nor soccer. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal number of students = (Students who play basketball) + (Students who play soccer) - (Students who play both sports) + (Students who play neither sport)\n\n60 = 35 + 25 - 15 + (Students who play neither sport)\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of students who play neither sport:\n\n60 = 45 + (Students who play neither sport)\n\n(Students who play neither sport) = 60 - 45\n\n(Students who play neither sport) = 15\n\nSo, 15 students neither play basketball nor soccer."
