    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph with 7 vertices such that no adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph (every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the minimum number of colors needed is equal to the maximum degree of the vertices plus 1, which is 7 for a complete graph with 7 vertices. However, if the graph is not complete and has a lower degree, fewer colors may be needed."
