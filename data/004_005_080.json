    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' - 4y = 0, we first find the characteristic equation, which is:\n\nr^2 - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for r:\n\n(r - 2)(r + 2) = 0\n\nSo, the roots are r1 = 2 and r2 = -2.\n\nNow, we can write the general solution of the given differential equation as:\n\ny(x) = C1 * e^(2x) + C2 * e^(-2x)\n\nWe are given the initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = -1. We will use these to find the values of C1 and C2.\n\nFirst, let's find y'(x):\n\ny'(x) = 2 * C1 * e^(2x) - 2 * C2 * e^(-2x)\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\n1) y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = C1 * e^(0) + C2 * e^(0)\n2 = C1 + C2\n\n2) y'(0) = -1:\n\n-1 = 2 * C1 * e^(0) - 2 * C2 * e^(0)\n-1 = 2 * C1 - 2 * C2\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n\nC1 + C2 = 2\n2 * C1 - 2 * C2 = -1\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of C1 and C2:\n\nFrom the first equation, we get C1 = 2 - C2. Substituting this into the second equation:\n\n2 * (2 - C2) - 2 * C2 = -1\n4 - 2 * C2 - 2 * C2 = -1\n4 - 4 * C2 = -1\n\nNow, we can solve for C2:\n\n4 * C2 = 5\nC2 = 5/4\n\nNow, we can find C1:\n\nC1 = 2 - C2\nC1 = 2 - 5/4\nC1 = 3/4\n\nSo, the particular solution of the given differential equation with the initial conditions is:\n\ny(x) = (3/4) * e^(2x) + (5/4) * e^(-2x)"
