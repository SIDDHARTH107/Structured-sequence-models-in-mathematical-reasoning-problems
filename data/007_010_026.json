    "message_1": "A math student has 3 different coloured T-shirts (red, blue, and green), and 5 pairs of socks (black, white, yellow, green, and blue). If the math student wants to wear a different coloured T-shirt and a different coloured sock each day of the week, how many different combinations of outfits are possible for the week using the Chinese remainder theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Chinese remainder theorem may not be the most appropriate method to solve this problem. Instead, we can use the counting principle to find the number of different combinations of outfits.\n\nFor each day of the week, the student can choose one of the 3 T-shirts and one of the 5 pairs of socks. Therefore, there are 3 choices for T-shirts and 5 choices for socks, making a total of 3 * 5 = 15 different combinations of outfits for a single day.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, and the student wants to wear a different combination each day, we can simply multiply the number of combinations for a single day by the number of days in the week.\n\nSo, the total number of different combinations of outfits for the week is 15 * 7 = 105."
