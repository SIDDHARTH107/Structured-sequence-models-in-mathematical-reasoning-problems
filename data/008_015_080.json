    "message_2": "First, we write the given system of linear equations as a matrix equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 6 & -3 \\\\\n6 & 13 & -7 \\\\\n-3 & -7 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n9 \\\\\n13 \\\\\n-5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we will find the Cholesky decomposition of the coefficient matrix. The Cholesky decomposition is a lower triangular matrix L such that $A = LL^T$. \n\n$$\nL = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nl_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\\nl_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\\\\nl_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe can find the elements of L using the following formulas:\n\n$$\nl_{11} = \\sqrt{a_{11}} = \\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n$$\nl_{21} = \\frac{a_{21}}{l_{11}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n$$\nl_{31} = \\frac{a_{31}}{l_{11}} = \\frac{-3}{\\sqrt{3}} = -\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n$$\nl_{22} = \\sqrt{a_{22} - l_{21}^2} = \\sqrt{13 - 12} = 1\n$$\n\n$$\nl_{32} = \\frac{a_{32} - l_{31}l_{21}}{l_{22}} = \\frac{-7 + 6}{1} = -1\n$$\n\n$$\nl_{33} = \\sqrt{a_{33} - l_{31}^2 - l_{32}^2} = \\sqrt{4 - 3 - 1} = 0\n$$\n\nHowever, since $l_{33} = 0$, the Cholesky decomposition does not exist for this matrix. This is because the matrix is not positive definite. In this case, we cannot use the Cholesky decomposition to solve the system of linear equations.\n\nWe can use other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition, to solve this system of linear equations."
