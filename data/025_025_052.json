    "message_2": "To show that the algebra $\\mathbb{K}\\langle x,y\\rangle/(yx-xy-1)$ is a domain, we need to show that it has no zero divisors. Suppose there exist nonzero elements $a,b \\in \\mathbb{K}\\langle x,y\\rangle/(yx-xy-1)$ such that $ab = 0$. We can write $a$ and $b$ as polynomials in $x$ and $y$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{K}$:\n\n$$a = \\sum_{i,j} a_{ij}x^iy^j, \\quad b = \\sum_{i,j} b_{ij}x^iy^j$$\n\nwhere $a_{ij}, b_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{K}$ and at least one of the $a_{ij}$ and $b_{ij}$ is nonzero. Now, we have\n\n$$ab = \\left(\\sum_{i,j} a_{ij}x^iy^j\\right)\\left(\\sum_{i,j} b_{ij}x^iy^j\\right) = \\sum_{i,j,k,l} a_{ij}b_{kl}x^ix^ky^jy^l.$$\n\nUsing the relation $yx = xy + 1$, we can rewrite the product $x^ix^ky^jy^l$ as\n\n$$x^ix^ky^jy^l = x^{i+k}y^{j+l} + \\delta_{ik}y^{j+l},$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{ik}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is $1$ if $i=k$ and $0$ otherwise. Therefore,\n\n$$ab = \\sum_{i,j,k,l} a_{ij}b_{kl}(x^{i+k}y^{j+l} + \\delta_{ik}y^{j+l}) = 0.$$\n\nNow, we need to show that this is not possible unless all the coefficients $a_{ij}b_{kl}$ are zero. Suppose there exist $i_0, j_0, k_0, l_0$ such that $a_{i_0j_0}b_{k_0l_0} \\neq 0$. Then, the term corresponding to $x^{i_0+k_0}y^{j_0+l_0}$ in the product $ab$ has a nonzero coefficient, which contradicts the fact that $ab = 0$. Therefore, all the coefficients $a_{ij}b_{kl}$ must be zero.\n\nHowever, this implies that either all the coefficients $a_{ij}$ or all the coefficients $b_{kl}$ are zero, which contradicts our assumption that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero elements. Hence, there are no zero divisors in the algebra $\\mathbb{K}\\langle x,y\\rangle/(yx-xy-1)$, and it is a domain."
