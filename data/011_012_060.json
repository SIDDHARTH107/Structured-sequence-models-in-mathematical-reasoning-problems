    "message_1": "In a class of 30 students, 18 are taking French, 12 are taking Spanish, and 8 are taking both French and Spanish. What is the minimum number of students in the class who are not taking either French or Spanish?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of students not taking either French or Spanish, we first need to determine the total number of students taking either French or Spanish or both.\n\nSince 8 students are taking both French and Spanish, we need to subtract this number from the total number of students taking French and Spanish to avoid double-counting these students.\n\nSo, the number of students taking only French is 18 - 8 = 10, and the number of students taking only Spanish is 12 - 8 = 4.\n\nNow, we add the number of students taking only French, only Spanish, and both French and Spanish: 10 + 4 + 8 = 22.\n\nFinally, we subtract this number from the total number of students in the class to find the minimum number of students not taking either French or Spanish: 30 - 22 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of students not taking either French or Spanish is 8."
