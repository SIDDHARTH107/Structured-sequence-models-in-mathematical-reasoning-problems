    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cylinder that needs to be painted, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nThe area of one circular base is:\nA = π(5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n2 * 25π cm² = 50π cm²\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nThe lateral surface area is:\nA = 2π(5 cm)(10 cm) = 100π cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\nTotal Surface Area = 50π cm² + 100π cm² = 150π cm²\n\nTo round the answer to two decimal places, we multiply by the value of π (approximately 3.14):\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 150 * 3.14 = 471 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder that needs to be painted is approximately 471 cm²."
