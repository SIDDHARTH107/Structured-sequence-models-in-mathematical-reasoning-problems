    "message_1": "A hot air balloon is flying at an altitude of 500 meters above ground level. The angle of depression from the balloon to a point on the ground is 35 degrees. How far away is the point on the ground from the balloon?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have the angle of depression (35 degrees) and the altitude of the balloon (500 meters). We can set up a right triangle with the altitude as the opposite side, the distance on the ground as the adjacent side, and the line from the balloon to the point on the ground as the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's call the distance on the ground \"x\". We can use the tangent function as follows:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(35) = 500 / x\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\nx = 500 / tan(35)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 500 / 0.7002\nx ≈ 713.67 meters\n\nSo, the point on the ground is approximately 713.67 meters away from the hot air balloon."
