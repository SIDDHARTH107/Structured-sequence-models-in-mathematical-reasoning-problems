    "message_1": "A transportation company offers two types of buses to travel from city A to city B. The first type has a 60% chance of arriving on time, whereas the second type has an 80% chance of arriving on time. If a passenger chooses the first type of bus on Monday and the second type of bus on Tuesday, what is the probability that both buses arrive on time?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both buses arrive on time, we need to multiply the probabilities of each bus arriving on time.\n\nThe probability of the first type of bus arriving on time on Monday is 60% or 0.6. The probability of the second type of bus arriving on time on Tuesday is 80% or 0.8.\n\nSo, the probability that both buses arrive on time is:\n\n0.6 (first bus) * 0.8 (second bus) = 0.48\n\nTherefore, there is a 48% chance that both buses will arrive on time."
