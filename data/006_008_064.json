    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 3 rainy days in the next 7 days, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, 7 days), k is the number of successes (rainy days), p is the probability of success (0.4), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe want to find the probability of getting at least 3 rainy days, so we need to find the probabilities for 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 rainy days and add them together.\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7)\n\nCalculating each probability:\n\nP(X = 3) = (7 choose 3) * 0.4^3 * 0.6^4 ≈ 0.2668\nP(X = 4) = (7 choose 4) * 0.4^4 * 0.6^3 ≈ 0.3110\nP(X = 5) = (7 choose 5) * 0.4^5 * 0.6^2 ≈ 0.1937\nP(X = 6) = (7 choose 6) * 0.4^6 * 0.6^1 ≈ 0.0681\nP(X = 7) = (7 choose 7) * 0.4^7 * 0.6^0 ≈ 0.0164\n\nAdding these probabilities together:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 0.2668 + 0.3110 + 0.1937 + 0.0681 + 0.0164 ≈ 0.8560\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 3 rainy days in the next 7 days is approximately 0.856 or 85.6%."
