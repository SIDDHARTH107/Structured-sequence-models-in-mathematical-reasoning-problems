    "message_2": "To find the energy of a particle in an infinite square well potential, we can use the energy formula for a particle in a box:\n\nE = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy, n is the quantum number, h is the Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle, and L is the width of the well.\n\nFrom the given wave function Ψ(x) = √(2/L)sin(πx/L), we can determine the quantum number n by comparing it to the general wave function for a particle in a box:\n\nΨ(x) = √(2/L)sin(nπx/L)\n\nIn this case, we can see that n = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of the particle. Since the type of particle is not specified, we will assume it is an electron. The mass of an electron (m) is approximately 9.11 × 10^(-31) kg.\n\nThe Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the energy formula:\n\nE = (1^2 * (6.626 × 10^(-34))^2) / (8 * 9.11 × 10^(-31) * (2 × 10^(-9))^2)\n\nE = (6.626 × 10^(-34))^2 / (8 * 9.11 × 10^(-31) * 4 × 10^(-18))\n\nE = 43.867 × 10^(-68) / (29.152 × 10^(-49))\n\nE = 1.505 × 10^(-19) J\n\nSo, the energy of the particle in the infinite square well potential with a width of 2 nm is approximately 1.505 × 10^(-19) Joules."
