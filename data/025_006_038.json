    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$, we first note that the given polynomial equation defines a smooth cubic surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. Smooth cubic surfaces are known to be simply connected, which implies that their first cohomology group vanishes, i.e., $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\nFor a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$, the Poincar√© duality states that $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^{2n-i}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. In our case, $X$ is a smooth cubic surface, so it has dimension $n = 2$. Thus, we have $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\nNow, we compute the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. For a smooth cubic surface $X \\subset \\mathbb{P}^3$, the Picard group $\\text{Pic}(X)$ is isomorphic to the second cohomology group with integer coefficients, i.e., $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Pic}(X)$. The Picard group of a smooth cubic surface is known to be a free abelian group of rank $1$, generated by the hyperplane class $H$. Therefore, $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}H$. Tensoring with $\\mathbb{Q}$, we obtain $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}H$.\n\nFinally, we compute the zeroth cohomology group $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. Since $X$ is a non-empty algebraic variety, we have $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nIn summary, the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ of the smooth cubic surface $X$ defined by the polynomial equation $f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 6xyz = 0$ are given by:\n\n- $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$\n- $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$\n- $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}H$\n- $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$"
