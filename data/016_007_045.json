    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, each cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes, and the middle cube along each axis (x, y, and z) is removed, as well as the cube in the center of the larger cube. This results in 20 smaller cubes remaining after the first iteration.\n\nFor the 3rd iteration, we will apply this process two more times:\n\n1st iteration: 20 cubes (1 large cube divided into 27 smaller cubes, with 7 removed)\n2nd iteration: 20 * 20 = 400 cubes (each of the 20 cubes from the 1st iteration is divided into 27 smaller cubes, with 7 removed from each)\n3rd iteration: 20 * 400 = 8000 cubes (each of the 400 cubes from the 2nd iteration is divided into 27 smaller cubes, with 7 removed from each)\n\nSo, there are 8000 cubes in the 3rd iteration of the Menger sponge construction."
