    "message_1": "A certain section of a highway has an average of 4 accidents per month. Assuming the accidents follow a Poisson distribution, what is the probability of having more than 6 accidents in a particular month?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of having more than 6 accidents in a particular month, we can use the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere λ is the average number of accidents per month (4 in this case), k is the number of accidents we want to find the probability for, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having more than 6 accidents, we need to find the probability of having 7, 8, 9, and so on accidents and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of having 6 or fewer accidents and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of having more than 6 accidents.\n\nP(X > 6) = 1 - P(X ≤ 6)\n\nWe need to calculate P(X ≤ 6) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6)\n\nUsing the Poisson distribution formula for each value of k from 0 to 6:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-4) * 4^0) / 0! ≈ 0.0183\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-4) * 4^1) / 1! ≈ 0.0732\nP(X = 2) = (e^(-4) * 4^2) / 2! ≈ 0.1465\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-4) * 4^3) / 3! ≈ 0.1953\nP(X = 4) = (e^(-4) * 4^4) / 4! ≈ 0.1953\nP(X = 5) = (e^(-4) * 4^5) / 5! ≈ 0.1562\nP(X = 6) = (e^(-4) * 4^6) / 6! ≈ 0.1041\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 6) = 0.0183 + 0.0732 + 0.1465 + 0.1953 + 0.1953 + 0.1562 + 0.1041 ≈ 0.8889\n\nFinally, subtract this from 1 to get the probability of having more than 6 accidents:\n\nP(X > 6) = 1 - 0.8889 ≈ 0.1111\n\nSo, the probability of having more than 6 accidents in a particular month is approximately 0.1111 or 11.11%."
