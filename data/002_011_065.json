    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg with a length of 5 cm and the hypotenuse with a length of 13 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). The formula is:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the length of one leg (a = 5 cm) and the length of the hypotenuse (c = 13 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nPlugging the given values into the formula, we get:\n\n5² + b² = 13²\n\n25 + b² = 169\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\nb² = 169 - 25\nb² = 144\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
