    "message_2": "To calculate the fractal dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, we can use the hint provided. The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is made up of 3 smaller self-similar copies of itself, and each copy is scaled down by a factor of 2.\n\nUsing the formula for fractal dimension, D = log(number of self-similar copies) / log(scaling factor):\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nSo, the fractal dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is approximately 1.585."
