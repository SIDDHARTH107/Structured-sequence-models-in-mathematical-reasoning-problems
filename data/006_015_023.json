    "message_1": "A network administrator estimated that the probability of a cyber attack of a certain type occurring on a company's network is 0.10. If the company has 1000 computers connected to the network, what is the probability that at least one computer will be impacted by this type of cyber attack?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one computer will be impacted by this type of cyber attack, we can first find the probability that none of the computers will be impacted and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single computer will not be impacted by the cyber attack is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nSince there are 1000 computers, the probability that none of them will be impacted is (0.90)^1000.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one computer will be impacted:\n\nP(at least one computer impacted) = 1 - P(none of the computers impacted)\nP(at least one computer impacted) = 1 - (0.90)^1000\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(at least one computer impacted) ≈ 1 - 1.74 × 10^(-46) ≈ 0.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999826\n\nSo, the probability that at least one computer will be impacted by this type of cyber attack is approximately 0.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999826, or almost certain."
