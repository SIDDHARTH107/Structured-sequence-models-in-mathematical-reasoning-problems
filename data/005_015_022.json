    "message_2": "To perform k-means clustering with k=2, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize two centroids randomly or by selecting two data points. For this example, let's choose the first two data points as initial centroids: C1 = (1,1) and C2 = (2,1).\n\n2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n\n3. Update the centroids by calculating the mean of all the data points assigned to each centroid.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a certain number of iterations have been reached.\n\nLet's perform the k-means clustering:\n\nIteration 1:\n- Assign data points to centroids:\n  - Cluster 1: (1,1), (2,1)\n  - Cluster 2: (4,3), (5,4), (6,5), (7,6), (9,8)\n- Update centroids:\n  - C1 = ((1+2)/2, (1+1)/2) = (1.5, 1)\n  - C2 = ((4+5+6+7+9)/5, (3+4+5+6+8)/5) = (6.2, 5.2)\n\nIteration 2:\n- Assign data points to centroids:\n  - Cluster 1: (1,1), (2,1), (4,3)\n  - Cluster 2: (5,4), (6,5), (7,6), (9,8)\n- Update centroids:\n  - C1 = ((1+2+4)/3, (1+1+3)/3) = (2.333, 1.667)\n  - C2 = ((5+6+7+9)/4, (4+5+6+8)/4) = (6.75, 5.75)\n\nIteration 3:\n- Assign data points to centroids:\n  - Cluster 1: (1,1), (2,1), (4,3)\n  - Cluster 2: (5,4), (6,5), (7,6), (9,8)\n- Update centroids:\n  - C1 = ((1+2+4)/3, (1+1+3)/3) = (2.333, 1.667)\n  - C2 = ((5+6+7+9)/4, (4+5+6+8)/4) = (6.75, 5.75)\n\nThe centroids did not change in the last iteration, so we can stop the process. The final centroids are:\n\nC1 = (2.333, 1.667)\nC2 = (6.75, 5.75)"
