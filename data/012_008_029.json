    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar, we can use Kuratowski's theorem or Euler's formula. In this case, Euler's formula is more straightforward to apply. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn our case, we have V = 7 and E = 10. We want to find out if there exists a value for F such that the equation holds.\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - 7 + 10\nF = 5\n\nSo, if the graph is planar, it should have 5 faces. Now, let's use the inequality derived from the Handshaking lemma for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for our graph:\n\n10 ≤ 3(7) - 6\n10 ≤ 21 - 6\n10 ≤ 15\n\nThe inequality holds, which means that the graph could be planar. However, this is not a guarantee, so we need to try to draw the graph in a planar way or find a subgraph that is non-planar.\n\nAfter trying different configurations, we can find a planar representation of the graph G:\n\n```\n   1\n  /|\\\n / | \\\n6--5--2\n|\\ | /|\n| \\|/ |\n 3---4\n```\n\nThis drawing of the graph has 7 vertices, 10 edges, and 5 faces (including the outer face), which satisfies Euler's formula. Therefore, the graph G is planar."
