What is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the transposition cipher with the key \"3142\", we need to rearrange the letters according to the key. We can do this by breaking the message into groups of 4 characters and applying the key to each group.\n\n1. Break the message into groups of 4 characters:\n   HELLO WORLD -> (HELL) (O WO) (RLD)\n\n2. Apply the key to each group:\n   (HELL) -> (EHL L)\n   (O WO) -> (OOW )\n   (RLD) -> (LDR)\n\n3. Combine the encrypted groups:\n   EHL LOOW LDR\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"EHL LOOW LDR\"."
