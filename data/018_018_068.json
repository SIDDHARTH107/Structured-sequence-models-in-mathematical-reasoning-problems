    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {1}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference by subtracting the intersection from the union:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {1} = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of A and B is:\n\n{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}"
