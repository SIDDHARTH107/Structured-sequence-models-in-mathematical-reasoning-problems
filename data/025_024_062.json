    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct solutions to the given polynomial equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0 with x, y, and z being positive integers less than or equal to 10, we can use the following approach:\n\nFirst, notice that the given equation can be rewritten as (x+y+z)(x^2+y^2+z^2-xy-xz-yz)=0. Since x, y, and z are positive integers, the term (x+y+z) cannot be zero. Therefore, we must have x^2+y^2+z^2-xy-xz-yz=0.\n\nNow, let's use geometric invariant theory to find the number of distinct solutions. We can rewrite the equation as x^2+y^2+z^2=xy+xz+yz. This equation is symmetric in x, y, and z, so we can assume without loss of generality that x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nWe can now check all possible combinations of x, y, and z in the range of 1 to 10 and count the number of solutions that satisfy the equation. Here is a list of distinct solutions:\n\n1. (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1)\n2. (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3)\n3. (x, y, z) = (1, 4, 5)\n4. (x, y, z) = (1, 5, 6)\n5. (x, y, z) = (1, 7, 8)\n6. (x, y, z) = (1, 8, 9)\n7. (x, y, z) = (2, 2, 4)\n8. (x, y, z) = (2, 4, 6)\n9. (x, y, z) = (2, 6, 8)\n10. (x, y, z) = (3, 3, 3)\n11. (x, y, z) = (3, 4, 5)\n12. (x, y, z) = (4, 4, 4)\n\nThere are 12 distinct solutions to the given polynomial equation when x, y, and z are restricted to be positive integers less than or equal to 10."
