    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A △ B) and C, denoted as (A △ B) △ C.\n\n(A △ B) △ C = ({1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5}) = {1, 3, 4, 5} - {4} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference between B and C, denoted as B △ C.\n\nB △ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A and (B △ C), denoted as A △ (B △ C).\n\nA △ (B △ C) = (A ∪ {2, 5}) - (A ∩ {2, 5}) = {1, 2, 3, 5} - {2} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow we have found (A △ B) △ C = {1, 3, 5} and A △ (B △ C) = {1, 3, 5}. The two sets are equal.\n\nHowever, the question asks to show that the two sets are not equal with respect to Cartesian product. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set. In this case, the sets (A △ B) △ C and A △ (B △ C) are equal, so their Cartesian products with any other set will also be equal. Therefore, it is not possible to show that the two sets are not equal with respect to Cartesian product, as they are equal sets."
