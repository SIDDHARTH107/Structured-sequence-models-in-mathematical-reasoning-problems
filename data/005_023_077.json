    "message_2": "To determine the outliers using the Tukey method with a multiplier of 1.5, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the dataset.\n2. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3.\n3. Calculate the lower bound by subtracting 1.5 times the IQR from Q1.\n4. Calculate the upper bound by adding 1.5 times the IQR to Q3.\n5. Identify any data points that fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound as outliers.\n\nFirst, let's sort the dataset in ascending order: 5, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 26, 29, 76.\n\n1. Calculate Q1 and Q3:\n- Q1 is the median of the lower half of the dataset. Since there are 10 data points, the lower half consists of the first 5 numbers: 5, 9, 12, 16, 18. The median of these numbers is 12.\n- Q3 is the median of the upper half of the dataset. The upper half consists of the last 5 numbers: 20, 24, 26, 29, 76. The median of these numbers is 26.\n\n2. Calculate the IQR:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 26 - 12 = 14\n\n3. Calculate the lower bound:\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 12 - 1.5 * 14 = 12 - 21 = -9\n\n4. Calculate the upper bound:\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 26 + 1.5 * 14 = 26 + 21 = 47\n\n5. Identify outliers:\nAny data points below -9 or above 47 are considered outliers. In this dataset, the number 76 is above the upper bound, so it is an outlier.\n\nTherefore, using the Tukey method with a multiplier of 1.5, the outlier in the dataset is 76."
