    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) - cos(x) = 0, we can use the double angle formula for sine: sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) - cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out cos(x):\n\ncos(x)(2sin(x) - 1) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either cos(x) = 0 or 2sin(x) - 1 = 0.\n\n1) For cos(x) = 0:\n\nx = π/2 + nπ, where n is an integer.\n\nBetween 0 and 2π, we have two solutions:\n\nx = π/2 (when n = 0)\nx = 3π/2 (when n = 1)\n\n2) For 2sin(x) - 1 = 0:\n\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\nx = arcsin(1/2)\n\nBetween 0 and 2π, we have two solutions:\n\nx = π/6 (in the first quadrant)\nx = 5π/6 (in the second quadrant)\n\nSo, the solutions for x between 0 and 2π are:\n\nx = π/6, π/2, 5π/6, and 3π/2."
