    "message_2": "To find the volume form for the surface S defined by x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4, we first parameterize the surface using spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the surface S can be represented as:\n\nx = 2sin(θ)cos(ϕ)\ny = 2sin(θ)sin(ϕ)\nz = 2cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ ∈ [0, π] and ϕ ∈ [0, 2π].\n\nNow, we compute the Jacobian matrix J of the transformation from spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates:\n\nJ = |∂(x, y, z)/∂(θ, ϕ)|\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\n∂x/∂θ = 2cos(θ)cos(ϕ)\n∂x/∂ϕ = -2sin(θ)sin(ϕ)\n∂y/∂θ = 2cos(θ)sin(ϕ)\n∂y/∂ϕ = 2sin(θ)cos(ϕ)\n∂z/∂θ = -2sin(θ)\n∂z/∂ϕ = 0\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ = | 2cos(θ)cos(ϕ)  -2sin(θ)sin(ϕ) |\n    | 2cos(θ)sin(ϕ)   2sin(θ)cos(ϕ) |\n    |    -2sin(θ)           0        |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the Jacobian matrix:\n\ndet(J) = -8sin^2(θ)cos^2(ϕ) - 8sin^2(θ)sin^2(ϕ) = -8sin^2(θ)(cos^2(ϕ) + sin^2(ϕ)) = -8sin^2(θ)\n\nThe volume form is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix:\n\n|det(J)| = 8sin^2(θ)\n\nSo, the volume form for the surface S is 8sin^2(θ) dθ dϕ."
