    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by repeatedly removing the middle third of each segment. After each iteration, the remaining segments have a total length of 2/3 of the previous length.\n\nLet's calculate the total length of the remaining segments after 4 iterations:\n\n1st iteration: (2/3) * 81 cm = 54 cm\n2nd iteration: (2/3) * 54 cm = 36 cm\n3rd iteration: (2/3) * 36 cm = 24 cm\n4th iteration: (2/3) * 24 cm = 16 cm\n\nSo, after 4 iterations, the total length of the remaining segments is 16 cm."
