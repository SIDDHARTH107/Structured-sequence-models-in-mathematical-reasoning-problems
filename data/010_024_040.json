    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is less than 180 degrees. The formula for the angle sum of a hyperbolic triangle is:\n\nSum of angles = 180 - A,\n\nwhere A is the area of the triangle in hyperbolic geometry.\n\nHowever, we don't need to find the area to determine the value of x. Since we know that the angle sum is less than 180 degrees and we are given two angles (30 and 45 degrees), we can find the third angle x as follows:\n\nx = 180 - (30 + 45)\nx = 180 - 75\nx = 105 degrees\n\nSo, the third angle x measures 105 degrees. However, this is the value of x in Euclidean geometry. In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum is less than 180 degrees, so the value of x must be less than 105 degrees. Unfortunately, without more information about the triangle, we cannot determine the exact value of x in hyperbolic geometry."
