    "message_2": "If each fisherman can catch a maximum of 5 fish per day, and there are 10 fishermen, then they can catch a total of 5 fish/day * 10 fishermen = 50 fish/day.\n\nSince there are 50 fish in the pond, it would take the fishermen 50 fish / 50 fish/day = 1 day to completely deplete the fish population."
