    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that allows us to isolate x. We can start by expressing 64 as a power of 2 since the left side of the equation is also in terms of 2.\n\n64 = 2^6\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^(3x+2) = 2^6\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n3x + 2 = 6\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x = 6 - 2\n3x = 4\nx = 4/3\n\nSo, x = 4/3."
