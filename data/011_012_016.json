    "message_1": "There are 50 students in a classroom, and each student plays at least one of the following sports: soccer, basketball, or volleyball. 20 students play soccer, 25 students play basketball, and 30 students play volleyball. Additionally, 15 students play both soccer and basketball, 10 students play both soccer and volleyball, and 12 students play both basketball and volleyball. There are 5 students who play all three sports. How many students play at least two of the three sports?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students who play at least two of the three sports, we need to find the number of students who play two sports and add the number of students who play all three sports.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of students who play exactly two sports. We know that:\n\n- 15 students play both soccer and basketball\n- 10 students play both soccer and volleyball\n- 12 students play both basketball and volleyball\n\nHowever, the students who play all three sports are counted in each of these groups. So, we need to subtract the number of students who play all three sports (5 students) from each of these groups to find the number of students who play exactly two sports:\n\n- 15 - 5 = 10 students play exactly soccer and basketball\n- 10 - 5 = 5 students play exactly soccer and volleyball\n- 12 - 5 = 7 students play exactly basketball and volleyball\n\nNow, we can add the number of students who play exactly two sports and the number of students who play all three sports to find the total number of students who play at least two sports:\n\n10 + 5 + 7 + 5 = 27 students play at least two of the three sports."
