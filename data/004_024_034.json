    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the implicit function y = x^2 sin(xy) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule and implicit differentiation. \n\nFirst, differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(y) = d/dx(x^2 sin(xy))\n\nSince y is a function of x, we will use the chain rule when differentiating y:\n\ndy/dx = d/dx(x^2 sin(xy))\n\nNow, we will differentiate the right side of the equation using the product rule:\n\nd/dx(x^2) * sin(xy) + x^2 * d/dx(sin(xy))\n\nThe derivative of x^2 with respect to x is 2x:\n\n2x * sin(xy) + x^2 * d/dx(sin(xy))\n\nNow, we need to differentiate sin(xy) with respect to x. We will use the chain rule again:\n\nd/dx(sin(xy)) = cos(xy) * d/dx(xy)\n\nThe derivative of xy with respect to x is y + x * dy/dx:\n\ncos(xy) * (y + x * dy/dx)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = 2x * sin(xy) + x^2 * cos(xy) * (y + x * dy/dx)\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx - x^2 * cos(xy) * x * dy/dx = 2x * sin(xy) + x^2 * cos(xy) * y\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx * (1 - x^3 * cos(xy)) = 2x * sin(xy) + x^2 * cos(xy) * y\n\nNow, divide by (1 - x^3 * cos(xy)) to isolate dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (2x * sin(xy) + x^2 * cos(xy) * y) / (1 - x^3 * cos(xy))\n\nTo find the value of dy/dx when x = 3, we need to find the corresponding value of y. We can use the original equation y = x^2 sin(xy) to find the value of y when x = 3:\n\ny = 3^2 * sin(3y)\n\ny = 9 * sin(3y)\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot solve for y explicitly in this equation. However, we can still find the value of dy/dx at x = 3 by plugging x = 3 into the dy/dx equation:\n\ndy/dx(3) = (2 * 3 * sin(3y) + 3^2 * cos(3y) * y) / (1 - 3^3 * cos(3y))\n\ndy/dx(3) = (6 * sin(3y) + 9 * cos(3y) * y) / (1 - 27 * cos(3y))\n\nThe value of dy/dx at x = 3 depends on the value of y, which we cannot determine explicitly. However, we have found the expression for dy/dx in terms of x and y:\n\ndy/dx = (6 * sin(xy) + x^2 * cos(xy) * y) / (1 - x^3 * cos(xy))"
