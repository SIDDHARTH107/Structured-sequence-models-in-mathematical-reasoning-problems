    "message_2": "To solve this differential equation using complex analysis, we first notice that it is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with variable coefficients. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$y'' + \\frac{2z}{z^2-1}y' + \\frac{2}{z^2-1}y = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the Frobenius method to find the general solution. Assume that the solution has the form:\n\n$y(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n z^{n+r}$\n\nwhere $a_n$ are the coefficients and $r$ is the index. Differentiating $y(z)$ with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$y'(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (n+r) a_n z^{n+r-1}$\n\nand differentiating once more:\n\n$y''(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (n+r)(n+r-1) a_n z^{n+r-2}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the differential equation, we obtain:\n\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (n+r)(n+r-1) a_n z^{n+r-2} + \\frac{2z}{z^2-1} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (n+r) a_n z^{n+r-1} + \\frac{2}{z^2-1} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n z^{n+r} = 0$\n\nNow, we multiply the second term by $(z^2-1)$ and the third term by $(z^2-1)^2$ to get a common denominator:\n\n$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (n+r)(n+r-1) a_n z^{n+r} + 2z \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (n+r) a_n z^{n+r-1}(z^2-1) + 2 \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n z^{n+r}(z^2-1) = 0$\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of each power of $z$ to zero. This gives us a recurrence relation for the coefficients $a_n$:\n\n$(n+r)(n+r-1) a_n + 2(n+r-1) a_{n-1} - 2 a_{n-2} = 0$\n\nSolving this recurrence relation, we can find the coefficients $a_n$ in terms of $a_0$ and $a_1$. The general solution will then be a linear combination of the two linearly independent solutions:\n\n$y(z) = a_0 y_1(z) + a_1 y_2(z)$\n\nwhere $y_1(z)$ and $y_2(z)$ are the two linearly independent solutions found by solving the recurrence relation for the coefficients $a_n$."
