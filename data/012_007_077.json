We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize the flow in all edges to 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path from A to G in the residual graph.\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path and update the residual capacities.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Initial flow is 0 for all edges.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path:\n   A -> B -> C -> F -> G\n   The bottleneck capacity of this path is 10 (the minimum capacity along the path).\n\n3. Update the flow and residual capacities:\n   A -> B: 10/15\n   B -> C: 10/10\n   C -> F: 10/20\n   F -> G: 10/8\n\n4. Find another augmenting path:\n   A -> D -> E -> F -> G\n   The bottleneck capacity of this path is 5 (the minimum capacity along the path).\n\n5. Update the flow and residual capacities:\n   A -> D: 5/12\n   D -> E: 5/5\n   E -> F: 5/20\n   F -> G: 15/8 (10 from the previous flow and 5 from this path)\n\nNo more augmenting paths can be found. The maximum flow from node A to node G is 15 (the sum of the flows entering node G)."
