    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the intersection cohomology group with rational coefficients at the origin, we first need to find the intersection of the two quadrics Q_1 and Q_2.\n\nLet's solve the system of equations formed by Q_1 and Q_2:\n\n$$\nQ_1: x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 + 3x_3^2 + 4x_1x_2 - 4x_1x_3 - 4x_2x_3 = 0\n$$\n$$\nQ_2: x_1^2+x_2^2+2x_3^2 - 2x_1x_2 - 2x_1x_3 + 2x_2x_3 = 0\n$$\n\nSubtract Q_2 from Q_1 to eliminate the x_1^2, x_2^2, and x_3^2 terms:\n\n$$\nQ_1 - Q_2: x_2^2 + x_3^2 + 6x_1x_2 - 2x_1x_3 - 6x_2x_3 = 0\n$$\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation in matrix form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1 & x_2 & x_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 6 & -2 \\\\\n6 & 1 & -6 \\\\\n-2 & -6 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= 0\n$$\n\nWe can find the rank of the matrix to determine the dimension of the intersection:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 6 & -2 \\\\\n6 & 1 & -6 \\\\\n-2 & -6 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\sim\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n6 & 1 & -6 \\\\\n0 & 6 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe rank of the matrix is 2, which means the intersection is a one-dimensional variety (a curve) in the three-dimensional space.\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection cohomology group with rational coefficients at the origin. Since the intersection is a curve, the only non-trivial cohomology group is H^1, which is the first cohomology group. The dimension of H^1 is equal to the rank of the matrix, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group with rational coefficients at the origin is 2."
