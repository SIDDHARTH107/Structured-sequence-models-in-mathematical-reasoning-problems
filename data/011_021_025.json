    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible routes and calculating their total distances. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, but since the route is a cycle, we can divide this by 5, resulting in 4! = 24 possible routes to consider. We can list them as follows, starting and ending at city A:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A\n4. A-B-D-E-C-A\n5. A-B-E-C-D-A\n6. A-B-E-D-C-A\n7. A-C-B-D-E-A\n8. A-C-B-E-D-A\n9.

A-E-D-C-B-A\n\nNow, we calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. 10+35+30+50+25 = 150\n2. 10+35+10+50+20 = 125\n3. 10+25+30+10+15 = 90\n4. 10+25+50+10+35 = 130\n5. 10+20+10+30+20 = 90\n6. 10+20+50+30+35 = 145\n7. 15+35+25+50+10 = 135\n8. 15+35+20+50+25 = 145\n9. 15+25+25+10+20 = 95\n10. 15+25+50+20+10 = 120\n11. 15+10+20+25+20 = 90\n12. 15+10+50+25+35 = 135\n13. 20+25+35+10+15 = 105\n14. 20+25+20+10+35 = 110\n15. 20+30+35+10+25 = 120\n16. 20+30+10+20+10 = 90\n17. 20+50+35+10+15 = 130\n18. 20+50+10+35+25 = 140\n19. 25+20+35+30+20 = 130\n20. 25+20+25+30+35 = 135\n21. 25+10+20+25+20 = 100\n22. 25+10+50+20+10 = 115\n23. 25+50+20+35+15 = 145\n24. 25+50+25+35+10 = 145\n\nThe shortest route is the one with the minimum total distance. We can see that routes 3, 5, and 16 all have a total distance of 90. Therefore, the shortest possible route that the salesman can take is either A-B-D-C-E-A, A-B-E-C-D-A, or A-D-C-E-B-A, with a total distance of 90 units."
