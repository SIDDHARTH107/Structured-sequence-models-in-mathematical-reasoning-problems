    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant has 400 employees working in different departments. The probability of an accident occurring in the packaging department is 0.03, in the assembly department is 0.05, and in the maintenance department is 0.08. \nWhat is the probability that an accident will occur in the packaging or assembly department?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of an accident occurring in either the packaging or assembly department, we can simply add the individual probabilities of accidents occurring in each department. However, we need to make sure we don't double-count the probability of an accident occurring in both departments, which is not given in this problem. Since the problem does not mention any correlation between accidents in the packaging and assembly departments, we can assume that the events are mutually exclusive.\n\nSo, the probability of an accident occurring in either the packaging or assembly department is:\n\nP(packaging or assembly) = P(packaging) + P(assembly)\nP(packaging or assembly) = 0.03 + 0.05\nP(packaging or assembly) = 0.08\n\nTherefore, the probability of an accident occurring in either the packaging or assembly department is 0.08 or 8%."
