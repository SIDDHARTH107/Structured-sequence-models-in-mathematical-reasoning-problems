    "message_1": "A city is located in a region that has a 0.05 probability of being hit by a hurricane every year. What is the probability that in the next 10 years, the city will be hit by at least 2 hurricanes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability of the city being hit by at least 2 hurricanes, we will find the probability of the city being hit by 0 or 1 hurricane and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula: P(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nWhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x successes (hurricanes) in n trials (years)\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (n! / (x! * (n-x)!))\n- p is the probability of success (hurricane) in a single trial (year)\n- n is the number of trials (years)\n- x is the number of successes (hurricanes)\n\nFirst, we find the probability of 0 hurricanes in 10 years:\nP(0) = C(10, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(10-0)\nP(0) = 1 * 1 * 0.95^10\nP(0) ≈ 0.5987\n\nNext, we find the probability of 1 hurricane in 10 years:\nP(1) = C(10, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(10-1)\nP(1) = 10 * 0.05 * 0.95^9\nP(1) ≈ 0.3151\n\nNow, we find the complementary probability of at least 2 hurricanes:\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)\nP(at least 2) = 1 - 0.5987 - 0.3151\nP(at least 2) ≈ 0.0862\n\nSo, the probability that the city will be hit by at least 2 hurricanes in the next 10 years is approximately 0.0862 or 8.62%."
