    "message_2": "To find all solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π], we first isolate sin(x):\n\n2 sin(x) + 1 = 0\n2 sin(x) = -1\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\nNow we need to find all angles x in the interval [0, 2π] for which sin(x) = -1/2. Since the sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we will find one angle in each of those quadrants.\n\nFor the third quadrant, we know that sin(π - x) = sin(x), so we can find the reference angle:\n\nsin(π - x) = -1/2\nπ - x = arcsin(-1/2)\nx = π - arcsin(-1/2)\n\nFor the fourth quadrant, we know that sin(2π - x) = -sin(x), so we can find the reference angle:\n\nsin(2π - x) = -(-1/2)\n2π - x = arcsin(1/2)\nx = 2π - arcsin(1/2)\n\nNow we can find the numerical values for x:\n\nx1 = π - arcsin(-1/2) ≈ π - (-π/6) ≈ 7π/6\nx2 = 2π - arcsin(1/2) ≈ 2π - π/6 ≈ 11π/6\n\nSo the solutions to the equation 2 sin(x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π] are x1 ≈ 7π/6 and x2 ≈ 11π/6."
