    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}. Find (A △ B) △ {2} and A △ (B △{2}) where △ is the symmetric difference and {} denotes an empty set with respect to Cartesian product. Show that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 4, 5} (since 3 is in both A and B, it is not included)\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ {2}. The symmetric difference of {1, 2, 4, 5} and {2} is:\n\n(A △ B) △ {2} = {1, 4, 5} (since 2 is in both A △ B and {2}, it is not included)\n\nNext, let's find B △ {2}. The symmetric difference of B and {2} is:\n\nB △ {2} = {2, 3, 4, 5} (since 2 is not in B, it is included)\n\nNow, let's find A △ (B △ {2}). The symmetric difference of A and {2, 3, 4, 5} is:\n\nA △ (B △ {2}) = {1, 2, 4} (since 3 is in both A and B △ {2}, it is not included)\n\nWe can see that (A △ B) △ {2} = {1, 4, 5} and A △ (B △ {2}) = {1, 2, 4}. Since these two sets are not equal, this demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative."
