    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase of the cosine and sine components of f(t) corresponding to the frequency of 2 Hz, we first need to express the Fourier transform F(w) in terms of its real and imaginary parts.\n\nF(w) = A(w)cos(φ(w)) + jB(w)sin(φ(w))\n\nFor w = 2, we have F(2) = 5 + 7j. Therefore,\n\nA(2)cos(φ(2)) = 5\nB(2)sin(φ(2)) = 7\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude and phase of the cosine and sine components:\n\nAmplitude of cosine component: A(2) = sqrt(5^2 + 7^2) = sqrt(74)\nPhase of cosine component: φ(2) = arctan(7/5) = arctan(1.4)\n\nAmplitude of sine component: B(2) = sqrt(5^2 + 7^2) = sqrt(74)\nPhase of sine component: φ(2) = arctan(7/5) = arctan(1.4)\n\nSo, the amplitude of the cosine and sine components of f(t) corresponding to the frequency of 2 Hz is sqrt(74), and the phase is arctan(1.4)."
