    "message_2": "To find the arithmetic genus of Y, we will first find the arithmetic genus of X and then adjust it for the blow-ups.\n\nThe arithmetic genus (p_a) of a smooth projective curve of degree d in the complex projective plane is given by the formula:\n\np_a = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nIn our case, X is a smooth cubic curve, so d = 3. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\np_a(X) = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = (2)(1)/2 = 1\n\nNow, we need to account for the blow-ups. Blowing up a point on a curve increases the arithmetic genus by 1. Since we are blowing up six points, the arithmetic genus of Y will be:\n\np_a(Y) = p_a(X) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nSo, the arithmetic genus of Y is 7."
