    "message_2": "To prove that X is a Hausdorff space, we need to show that for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist neighborhoods U and V of x and y respectively such that U and V are disjoint.\n\nWe are given that for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist neighborhoods U and V of x and y respectively such that U and V are disjoint. This is exactly the definition of a Hausdorff space. Therefore, X is a Hausdorff space.\n\nNow let's consider the specific numerical problem. Let X be a set of three points, say X = {a, b, c}, and a topology T = {{}, {a}, {b}, {a,b}, {a,b,c}}. We need to determine whether the space (X,T) is a Hausdorff space or not.\n\nTo check if (X,T) is a Hausdorff space, we need to see if for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist neighborhoods U and V of x and y respectively such that U and V are disjoint.\n\nLet's consider the pairs of distinct points in X:\n\n1. For x = a and y = b, we can choose U = {a} and V = {b}. These are neighborhoods of a and b respectively, and U ∩ V = {} (disjoint).\n\n2. For x = a and y = c, there is no open set containing c in the topology T. Therefore, we cannot find neighborhoods U and V of a and c respectively such that U and V are disjoint.\n\nSince we cannot find disjoint neighborhoods for all pairs of distinct points in X, the space (X,T) is not a Hausdorff space."
