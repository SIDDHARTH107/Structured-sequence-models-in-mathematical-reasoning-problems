The project manager wants to assign each employee to at least one project, while minimizing the total number of required employees. The required team sizes for each project are: project 1: 3 employees, project 2: 5 employees, project 3: 2 employees, project 4: 4 employees, project 5: 2 employees. What is the minimum number of employees needed to complete all of the projects?",

In this case, the minimum number of employees needed is the sum of the required team sizes for each project.\n\nMinimum number of employees = 3 (project 1) + 5 (project 2) + 2 (project 3) + 4 (project 4) + 2 (project 5) = 16 employees."
