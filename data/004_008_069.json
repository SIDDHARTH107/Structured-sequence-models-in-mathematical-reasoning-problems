    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 4 at the point x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 4 is:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x - 4)/dx = 4x + 3\n\nNow, we evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 4(2) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 4 at the point x = 2 is 11."
