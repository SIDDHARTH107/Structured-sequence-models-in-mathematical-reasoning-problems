    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let x be the smallest positive integer. We have the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 3 × 5 × 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we find the partial products: N1 = N/3 = 35, N2 = N/5 = 21, and N3 = N/7 = 15.\n\nNow, we find the modular inverses of the partial products:\n\n35 × a1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => a1 ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n21 × a2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => a2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n15 × a3 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => a3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFinally, we compute the solution x:\n\nx = (2 × 35 × 2) + (3 × 21 × 1) + (2 × 15 × 1) = 140 + 63 + 30 = 233.\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is congruent to 233 modulo 105:\n\nx ≡ 233 (mod 105)\n\n233 = 2 × 105 + 23\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is x = 23."
