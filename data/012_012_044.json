    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of graph G, we can use the fact that a simple, connected graph with n vertices and minimum degree δ has girth at most 1 + ⌊(2*(n-1))/δ⌋.\n\nIn graph G, we have 10 vertices and 15 edges. The minimum degree δ can be found using the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in G is 2 * 15 = 30.\n\nSince G is a simple graph, the maximum degree of any vertex is 9 (it can be connected to all other vertices). Therefore, the minimum degree δ of G is at least 3, because if it were 2, the sum of the degrees would be less than 30 (10 vertices * 2 = 20).\n\nNow, we can use the formula for girth: g = 1 + ⌊(2*(10-1))/3⌋ = 1 + ⌊(18)/3⌋ = 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nSo, the girth of graph G is at most 7. However, we need to check if a graph with such parameters exists. We can construct a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges with a girth of 7 by creating a 7-cycle (a cycle with 7 vertices) and connecting the remaining 3 vertices to one vertex of the 7-cycle. This graph has the required number of vertices and edges and has a girth of 7.\n\nTherefore, the girth of graph G is 7."
