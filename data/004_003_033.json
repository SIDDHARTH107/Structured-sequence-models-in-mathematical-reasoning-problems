    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be L and the width be W. The perimeter of the garden is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 80 feet of fencing, we can write this as:\n\n80 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we can solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (80 - 2L) / 2\nW = 40 - L\n\nThe area of the garden is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nSubstitute the expression for W from above:\n\nArea = L * (40 - L)\n\nNow, we have the area as a function of L:\n\nArea(L) = 40L - L^2\n\nTo find the dimensions that maximize the area, we need to find the maximum value of this function. We can do this by taking the derivative of the area with respect to L and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 40 - 2L\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for L:\n\n0 = 40 - 2L\n2L = 40\nL = 20\n\nNow that we have the value of L, we can find the value of W using the expression we found earlier:\n\nW = 40 - L\nW = 40 - 20\nW = 20\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that maximize its area are 20 feet by 20 feet."
