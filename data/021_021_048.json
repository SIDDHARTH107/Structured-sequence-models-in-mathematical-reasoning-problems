The profit earned from selling one unit of A is $10, and the profit earned from selling one unit of B is $15. The company has two machines M1 and M2, and each product requires a certain amount of time to be produced by each machine. The production time in minutes for each unit of product A and B are shown in the table below:\n\n| Product | Machine M1 | Machine M2 |\n|---------|------------|------------|\n| A       | 3          | 2          |\n| B       | 1          | 4          |\n\nThe company has 270 minutes available on machine M1 and 360 minutes available on machine M2 for production. The company wants to maximize its profit by determining the optimal number of units of each product to produce using the cuckoo search algorithm. What is the maximum profit and the optimal number of units of product A and B to produce?",
    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is not necessary for solving this problem. Instead, we can use linear programming to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + y <= 270 (Machine M1)\n2x + 4y <= 360 (Machine M2)\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method or graphical method. In this case, we'll use the graphical method.\n\n1. Plot the constraint inequalities on a graph.\n2. Identify the feasible region (the area where all constraints are satisfied).\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region.\n4. Evaluate the profit function at each vertex.\n5. Choose the vertex with the highest profit value.\n\nAfter plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region, we find the vertices to be (0, 0), (0, 90), (60, 60), and (90, 0). Evaluating the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 90) = 10(0) + 15(90) = $1350\nP(60, 60) = 10(60) + 15(60) = $1500\nP(90, 0) = 10(90) + 15(0) = $900\n\nThe maximum profit is $1500, and the optimal number of units to produce is 60 units of product A and 60 units of product B."
