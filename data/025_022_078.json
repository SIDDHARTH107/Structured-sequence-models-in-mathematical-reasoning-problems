Let $\\mathcal{E}$ be the skyscraper sheaf supported at the point $(1,0,0) \\in X$ with stalk $\\mathcal{E}_{(1,0,0)} = \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nDetermine the cohomology groups $H^i(X,\\mathcal{E})$ for all $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.",
    "message_2": "First, we note that the given cubic equation $x^3 - 3x + 2 = 0$ has three distinct roots, which we can find by factoring the equation as $(x-1)(x^2+x-2) = (x-1)(x-1)(x+2) = 0$. Thus, the algebraic variety $X$ consists of three points: $x = 1, x = 1,$ and $x = -2$.\n\nNow, we consider the skyscraper sheaf $\\mathcal{E}$ supported at the point $(1,0,0) \\in X$ with stalk $\\mathcal{E}_{(1,0,0)} = \\mathbb{C}$. Since $\\mathcal{E}$ is supported at a single point, its cohomology groups will be concentrated in degree 0.\n\nTherefore, we have $H^i(X,\\mathcal{E}) = \\mathbb{C}$ for $i = 0$ and $H^i(X,\\mathcal{E}) = 0$ for $i \\neq 0$."
