    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. The equation is:\n\nlog₄(4x) + log₄(2) = 2\n\nFirst, we can use the property of logarithms that states logₐ(b) + logₐ(c) = logₐ(bc). So, we can combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation:\n\nlog₄(4x * 2) = 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n\nlog₄(8x) = 2\n\nNext, we can use the property of logarithms that states logₐ(b^c) = c * logₐ(b). In this case, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2 * log₄(2x) = 2\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nlog₄(2x) = 1\n\nTo remove the logarithm, we can use the property of logarithms that states a^(logₐ(b)) = b. In this case, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4^1 = 2x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n4 = 2x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = 2."
