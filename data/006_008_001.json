    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on any given day\n- n is the number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 7 (days)\n- k = 4 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.3 (probability of rain on any given day)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate nCk, which is the number of ways to choose 4 rainy days out of 7 days:\n\nnCk = C(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7-4)!)\n          = 7! / (4! * 3!)\n          = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n          = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n          = 35\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = (35) * (0.3)^4 * (1-0.3)^(7-4)\n        = 35 * (0.3)^4 * (0.7)^3\n        = 35 * 0.0081 * 0.343\n        â‰ˆ 0.3241\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 4 out of the next 7 days is approximately 0.3241 or 32.41%."
