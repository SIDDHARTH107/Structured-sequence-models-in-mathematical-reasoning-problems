    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of the given 2-form $\\alpha$, we will apply the following rules:\n\n1. Linearity: $d(\\alpha + \\beta) = d\\alpha + d\\beta$\n2. Leibniz rule: $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^p \\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$, where $\\alpha$ is a p-form.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite $\\alpha$ as a sum of wedge products:\n\n$\\alpha = (x^1 + x^2)dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 + x^1 x^3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nNow, we will apply the exterior derivative to each term separately:\n\n$d((x^1 + x^2)dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) = d(x^1 + x^2) \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nUsing the linearity rule, we can separate the terms:\n\n$= (d(x^1) + d(x^2)) \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nNow, we know that $d(x^i) = dx^i$, so we have:\n\n$= (dx^1 + dx^2) \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nNext, we apply the exterior derivative to the second term:\n\n$d(x^1 x^3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^3) = d(x^1 x^3) \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nUsing the Leibniz rule for the product of functions, we get:\n\n$= (x^3 d(x^1) + x^1 d(x^3)) \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nAgain, we know that $d(x^i) = dx^i$, so we have:\n\n$= (x^3 dx^1 + x^1 dx^3) \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nNow, we can combine the results for the two terms:\n\n$d\\alpha = (dx^1 + dx^2) \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 + (x^3 dx^1 + x^1 dx^3) \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nFinally, we simplify the expression by removing the terms that are equal to zero due to the antisymmetry of the wedge product:\n\n$d\\alpha = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 + x^3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^3 + x^1 dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nSince $dx^i \\wedge dx^i = 0$, we have:\n\n$d\\alpha = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$ on $M$ is $d\\alpha = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$."
