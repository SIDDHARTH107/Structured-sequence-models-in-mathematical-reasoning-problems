    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Stirling numbers of the second kind, we need to find the number of ways to partition a set of 10 elements (balls) into 4 non-empty subsets (boxes). Stirling numbers of the second kind are denoted by S(n, k), where n is the number of elements in the set and k is the number of non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, we want to find S(10, 4). However, since we need to ensure that each box contains at least one ball, we can first place one ball in each box, leaving us with 6 balls to distribute among the 4 boxes. Now, we need to find the number of ways to partition the remaining 6 balls into the 4 boxes, which is given by S(6, 4).\n\nUsing the recurrence relation for Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can calculate S(6, 4) as follows:\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3)\n\nTo find S(5, 4) and S(5, 3), we can use the same recurrence relation:\n\nS(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3)\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find S(4, 4), S(4, 3), and S(4, 2). For S(4, 4) and S(4, 2), we can use the base cases of Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, n) = 1 for all n\nS(n, 1) = 1 for all n\n\nSo, S(4, 4) = 1 and S(4, 2) = 7 (which can be calculated directly or using the recurrence relation).\n\nFor S(4, 3), we use the recurrence relation again:\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\n\nUsing the base cases, we find S(3, 3) = 1 and S(3, 2) = 3. Therefore,\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\n\nNow, we can find S(5, 4) and S(5, 3):\n\nS(5, 4) = 4 * 1 + 6 = 10\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\n\nFinally, we can find S(6, 4):\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * 10 + 25 = 65\n\nSo, there are 65 ways to distribute the remaining 6 balls among the 4 boxes. Since we already placed one ball in each box, the total number of ways to distribute 10 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes, such that each box contains at least one ball, is 65."
