    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented in the matrix form AX = B, where:\n\nA = |  5  2 -1 |\n    |  2 -8  4 |\n    | -1  4  1 |\n\nB = | 13 |\n    |-14 |\n    | 16 |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\n\nWe'll perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the U matrix and keep track of the multipliers to obtain the L matrix.\n\n1. No need to swap rows, so we can start eliminating.\n\n2. Eliminate the first element of the second row:\n\nMultiplier m21 = a21 / a11 = 2 / 5\n\nNew second row = row2 - m21 * row1\n=> | 0  (-8 - 2 * 2/5)  (4 + 2/5) |\n\n3. Eliminate the first element of the third row:\n\nMultiplier m31 = a31 / a11 = -1 / 5\n\nNew third row = row3 - m31 * row1\n=> | 0  (4 - 2 * -1/5)  (1 + 1/5) |\n\n4. Eliminate the second element of the third row:\n\nMultiplier m32 = a32 / a22 = (22/5) / (-36/5) = -11/18\n\nNew third row = row3 - m32 * row2\n=> | 0  0  (6/5 - 4 * -11/18) |\n\nNow we have the L and U matrices:\n\nL = |  1   0  0 |\n    | 2/5  1  0 |\n    |-1/5 -11/18 1 |\n\nU = |  5   2   -1  |\n    |  0 -36/5  6/5 |\n    |  0   0   40/9 |\n\nStep 2: Solve LY = B for Y\n\n1. Y1 = B1 / L11 = 13 / 1 = 13\n\n2. Y2 = (B2 - L21 * Y1) / L22 = (-14 - 2/5 * 13) / 1 = -54/5\n\n3. Y3 = (B3 - L31 * Y1 - L32 * Y2) / L33 = (16 + 1/5 * 13 + 11/18 * 54/5) / 1 = 22/3\n\nSo, Y = | 13    |\n         |-54/5  |\n         | 22/3  |\n\nStep 3: Solve UX = Y for X\n\n1. X3 = Y3 / U33 = (22/3) / (40/9) = 3\n\n2. X2 = (Y2 - U23 * X3) / U22 = (-54/5 - 6/5 * 3) / (-36/5) = 2\n\n3. X1 = (Y1 - U12 * X2 - U13 * X3) / U11 = (13 - 2 * 2 + 1 * 3) / 5 = 1\n\nSo, X = | 1 |\n         | 2 |\n         | 3 |\n\nThe solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
