    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of f(z) on the circle |z| = 2, we can use the fact that z = re^(iθ) for some r and θ, where r is the modulus of z and θ is the argument of z. Since |z| = 2, we have r = 2.\n\nNow, let z = 2e^(iθ), then f(z) = (2e^(iθ))^2 + 2(2e^(iθ)) + 1.\n\nSimplify f(z):\n\nf(z) = 4e^(2iθ) + 4e^(iθ) + 1.\n\nNow, let's find the modulus of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |4e^(2iθ) + 4e^(iθ) + 1|.\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum of |f(z)|, we can use the triangle inequality:\n\n|a + b + c| ≤ |a| + |b| + |c| and |a + b + c| ≥ ||a| - |b| - |c||.\n\nApplying the triangle inequality to |f(z)|:\n\n||4e^(2iθ)| - |4e^(iθ)| - |1|| ≤ |f(z)| ≤ |4e^(2iθ)| + |4e^(iθ)| + |1|.\n\nSince |4e^(2iθ)| = 4, |4e^(iθ)| = 4, and |1| = 1:\n\n||4 - 4 - 1|| ≤ |f(z)| ≤ 4 + 4 + 1.\n\nThus, 1 ≤ |f(z)| ≤ 9.\n\nNow, we need to check if these bounds can be achieved. Let's find the θ values that make |f(z)| equal to the bounds:\n\nFor |f(z)| = 1, we have:\n\n1 = |4e^(2iθ) + 4e^(iθ) + 1|.\n\nFor |f(z)| = 9, we have:\n\n9 = |4e^(2iθ) + 4e^(iθ) + 1|.\n\nBy solving these equations, we find that:\n\nFor |f(z)| = 1, θ = (2n + 1)π/3, where n is an integer.\n\nFor |f(z)| = 9, θ = 2nπ/3, where n is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the maximum modulus of f(z) on the circle |z| = 2 is 9, and the minimum modulus is 1."
