The cost function is given by:\n\nC(x,y) = 6x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2 + 6x + 18y - 12\n\nWhere x and y are variables that represent the quantity of two raw materials used in production. The company has 3 warehouses from which it can buy these raw materials. The transportation costs from each warehouse to the factory per unit of material are:\n\nWarehouse 1: $2 for x, $1 for y\n\nWarehouse 2: $7 for x, $5 for y\n\nWarehouse 3: $8 for x, $3 for y\n\nUsing whale optimization algorithm, find the minimum cost of producing the product and the optimal values of x and y.",
    "message_2": "As a language model AI, I am unable to run the Whale Optimization Algorithm directly. However, I can help you understand how to implement the algorithm to solve the problem.\n\nThe Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of a given objective function. In this case, the objective function is the cost function C(x, y).\n\nTo implement the WOA, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales with random positions (x, y) within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale using the objective function.\n3. Determine the best solution (whale) found so far.\n4. Update the positions of the whales using the WOA equations.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n6. The best solution found during the iterations will be the optimal values of x and y.\n\nFor this problem, you also need to consider the transportation costs from each warehouse. You can do this by adding the transportation costs to the cost function:\n\nC(x, y) = 6x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2 + 6x + 18y - 12 + T(x, y)\n\nWhere T(x, y) represents the transportation costs for x and y from the chosen warehouse. You can calculate T(x, y) for each warehouse and choose the one with the lowest cost.\n\nAfter implementing the Whale Optimization Algorithm and considering the transportation costs, you will obtain the minimum cost of producing the product and the optimal values of x and y."
