    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, product A and product B. The profit per unit of product A is $50 and for product B is $60. However, the production process for product A requires 2 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor time and for product B it requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor time. In a given week, the company has 80 hours of machine time and 60 hours of labor time available. What is the optimal production combination of products A and B to maximize the profit of the company? Use firefly algorithm to find the solution.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. However, as an AI language model, I cannot execute algorithms or code. Instead, I can guide you through the steps to solve the problem using the Firefly Algorithm.\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function is the profit function that we want to maximize. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function is P(x, y) = 50x + 60y.\n\n2. Define the constraints: The constraints are the available machine and labor hours. We have:\n\n   2x + 3y ≤ 80 (machine hours constraint)\n   3x + 2y ≤ 60 (labor hours constraint)\n   x, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\n3. Initialize the fireflies: Generate a random initial population of fireflies (solutions) that satisfy the constraints. Each firefly represents a possible solution (x, y).\n\n4. Define attractiveness and distance: The attractiveness of a firefly is based on its objective function value (profit). The distance between two fireflies can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n5. Move the fireflies: Update the positions of the fireflies based on their attractiveness and distance. Fireflies with higher attractiveness will attract other fireflies, and they will move towards the more attractive fireflies.\n\n6. Apply the constraints: After updating the positions, make sure the new positions still satisfy the constraints. If not, adjust the positions accordingly.\n\n7. Evaluate the new solutions: Calculate the profit for the new positions of the fireflies.\n\n8. Update the best solution: If a new solution has a higher profit than the current best solution, update the best solution.\n\n9. Repeat steps 5-8: Continue iterating through the algorithm until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a minimum change in the best solution.\n\n10. Return the best solution: The best solution found by the algorithm is the optimal production combination of products A and B to maximize the profit of the company.\n\nBy following these steps, you can apply the Firefly Algorithm to find the optimal production combination for the given problem."
