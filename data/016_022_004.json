    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nIn the first iteration, there is 1 tetrahedron (the original one).\nIn the second iteration, there are 4 tetrahedra.\nIn the third iteration, there are 4^2 = 16 tetrahedra.\nIn the fourth iteration, there are 4^3 = 64 tetrahedra.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of triangles in the fourth iteration. Each tetrahedron has 4 faces, which are triangles. So, in the fourth iteration, there are 64 tetrahedra * 4 faces per tetrahedron = 256 triangles."
