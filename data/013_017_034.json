    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question on Adverse Selection for a math student to solve:\n\nA used car dealer has a stock of 100 cars, of which 70 are in good condition and 30 are in bad condition. The dealer knows that the buyers cannot distinguish between a good car and a bad car before buying. The dealer must decide on the price of the cars, either high or low. If the dealer sets a high price, buyers will assume that the car is in good condition, and more buyers will choose to buy the cars. If the dealer sets a low price, buyers will assume that the car is in bad condition, and fewer buyers will choose to buy the cars. If a buyer buys a car in good condition, the seller earns $2000; if the buyer buys a car in bad condition, the seller has to pay $1000 to the buyer. What price should the dealer set for the cars to maximize profit, and what is the maximum possible profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the two scenarios: setting a high price and setting a low price.\n\n1. High price:\nIf the dealer sets a high price, all 100 cars will be sold. The dealer will earn $2000 for each of the 70 good cars and pay $1000 for each of the 30 bad cars.\n\nTotal profit for high price = (70 * $2000) - (30 * $1000) = $140,000 - $30,000 = $110,000\n\n2. Low price:\nIf the dealer sets a low price, fewer buyers will choose to buy the cars. Let's assume that only the 70 good cars are sold at the low price, as buyers are more likely to buy good cars at a low price. In this case, the dealer will earn $2000 for each of the 70 good cars and not sell any bad cars.\n\nTotal profit for low price = 70 * $2000 = $140,000\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the dealer should set a high price to maximize profit, as the total profit for the high price ($110,000) is lower than the total profit for the low price ($140,000).\n\nThe maximum possible profit is $140,000."
