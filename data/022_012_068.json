    "message_2": "To find the residue of f(z) at z = 2, we first need to identify the type of singularity at z = 2. Since the denominator (z-2) has a simple zero at z = 2, f(z) has a simple pole at z = 2.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the residue of a function with a simple pole:\n\nRes(f(z), z = 2) = lim (z -> 2) [(z - 2) * f(z)]\n\nRes(f(z), z = 2) = lim (z -> 2) [(z - 2) * (z + 1)/(z - 2)]\n\nThe (z - 2) term in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nRes(f(z), z = 2) = lim (z -> 2) (z + 1)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit as z approaches 2:\n\nRes(f(z), z = 2) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the residue of f(z) at z = 2 is 3."
