    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to find the number of ways to get a sum of 12 from 4 dice rolls and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes (6^4).\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to get a sum of 12 from 4 dice rolls. We can represent the 4 dice rolls as (a, b, c, d), where a, b, c, and d are the numbers rolled on each die. Since each die has 6 sides, a, b, c, and d can take values from 1 to 6.\n\nWe can list the combinations that give a sum of 12 as follows:\n\n(1, 1, 4, 6), (1, 1, 5, 5), (1, 1, 6, 4), (1, 2, 3, 6), (1, 2, 4, 5), (1, 2, 5, 4), (1, 2, 6, 3), (1, 3, 2, 6), (1, 3, 3, 5), (1, 3, 4, 4), (1, 3, 5, 3), (1, 3, 6, 2), (1, 4, 1, 6), (1, 4, 2, 5), (1, 4, 3, 4), (1, 4, 4, 3), (1, 4, 5, 2), (1, 4, 6, 1), (1, 5, 1, 5), (1, 5, 2, 4), (1, 5, 3, 3), (1, 5, 4, 2), (1, 5, 5, 1), (1, 6, 1, 4), (1, 6, 2, 3), (1, 6, 3, 2), (1, 6, 4, 1), (2, 1, 3, 6), (2, 1, 4, 5), (2, 1, 5, 4), (2, 1, 6, 3), (2, 2, 2, 6), (2, 2, 3, 5), (2, 2, 4, 4), (2, 2, 5, 3), (2, 2, 6, 2), (2, 3, 1, 6), (2, 3, 2, 5), (2, 3, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4, 3), (2, 3, 5, 2), (2, 3, 6, 1), (2, 4, 1, 5), (2, 4, 2, 4), (2, 4, 3, 3), (2, 4, 4, 2), (2, 4, 5, 1), (2, 5, 1, 4), (2, 5, 2, 3), (2, 5, 3, 2), (2, 5, 4, 1), (2, 6, 1, 3), (2, 6, 2, 2), (2, 6, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2, 6), (3, 1, 3, 5), (3, 1, 4, 4), (3, 1, 5, 3), (3, 1, 6, 2), (3, 2, 1, 6), (3, 2, 2, 5), (3, 2, 3, 4), (3, 2, 4, 3), (3, 2, 5, 2), (3, 2, 6, 1), (3, 3, 1, 5), (3, 3, 2, 4), (3, 3, 3, 3), (3, 3, 4, 2), (3, 3, 5, 1), (3, 4, 1, 4), (3, 4, 2, 3), (3, 4, 3, 2), (3, 4, 4, 1), (3, 5, 1, 3), (3, 5, 2, 2), (3, 5, 3, 1), (3, 6, 1, 2), (3, 6, 2, 1), (4, 1, 1, 6), (4, 1, 2, 5), (4, 1, 3, 4), (4, 1, 4, 3), (4, 1, 5, 2), (4, 1, 6, 1), (4, 2, 1, 5), (4, 2, 2, 4), (4, 2, 3, 3), (4, 2, 4, 2), (4, 2, 5, 1), (4, 3, 1, 4), (4, 3, 2, 3), (4, 3, 3, 2), (4, 3, 4, 1), (4, 4, 1, 3), (4, 4, 2, 2), (4, 4, 3, 1), (4, 5, 1, 2), (4, 5, 2, 1), (4, 6, 1, 1), (5, 1, 1, 5), (5, 1, 2, 4), (5, 1, 3, 3), (5, 1, 4, 2), (5, 1, 5, 1), (5, 2, 1, 4), (5, 2, 2, 3), (5, 2, 3, 2), (5, 2, 4, 1), (5, 3, 1, 3), (5, 3, 2, 2), (5, 3, 3, 1), (5, 4, 1, 2), (5, 4, 2, 1), (5, 5, 1, 1), (6, 1, 1, 4), (6, 1, 2, 3), (6, 1, 3, 2), (6, 1, 4, 1), (6, 2, 1, 3), (6, 2, 2, 2), (6, 2, 3, 1), (6, 3, 1, 2), (6, 3, 2, 1), (6, 4, 1, 1)\n\nThere are 126 combinations that give a sum of 12.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. Since there are 6 sides on each die and 4 dice, there are 6^4 = 1296 possible outcomes.\n\nFinally, let's find the probability. The probability of getting a sum of 12 from 4 dice rolls is the number of ways to get a sum of 12 divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to get a sum of 12) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 126 / 1296 â‰ˆ 0.0972\n\nSo, the probability of getting a sum of 12 from 4 dice rolls is approximately 0.0972 or 9.72%."
