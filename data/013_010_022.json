    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot competition between two companies producing identical products in a market. The demand function for the product is given by P = 100 - 2Q, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity produced by both companies. The cost function for each company is C(Q) = 10Q, where Q is the quantity produced by each company. Find the equilibrium quantity produced by each company and the market price.",
    "message_2": "Let Q1 and Q2 be the quantities produced by company 1 and company 2, respectively. Then, the total quantity produced in the market is Q = Q1 + Q2. The demand function can be rewritten as P(Q) = 100 - 2(Q1 + Q2).\n\nThe revenue function for each company is R(Q) = P(Q) * Q, and the profit function is π(Q) = R(Q) - C(Q). We will find the profit-maximizing output for each company by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to their respective quantities and setting it equal to zero.\n\nFor company 1:\nπ1(Q1) = (100 - 2(Q1 + Q2)) * Q1 - 10Q1\nTaking the first derivative with respect to Q1 and setting it to zero:\ndπ1(Q1)/dQ1 = 100 - 4Q1 - 2Q2 - 10 = 0\n\nFor company 2:\nπ2(Q2) = (100 - 2(Q1 + Q2)) * Q2 - 10Q2\nTaking the first derivative with respect to Q2 and setting it to zero:\ndπ2(Q2)/dQ2 = 100 - 2Q1 - 4Q2 - 10 = 0\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n1) 4Q1 + 2Q2 = 90\n2) 2Q1 + 4Q2 = 90\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. Multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation 2 by 1:\n1) 8Q1 + 4Q2 = 180\n2) 2Q1 + 4Q2 = 90\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n6Q1 = 90\nQ1 = 15\n\nNow substitute Q1 back into equation 2:\n2(15) + 4Q2 = 90\n30 + 4Q2 = 90\n4Q2 = 60\nQ2 = 15\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity produced by each company is 15 units. To find the market price, substitute Q1 and Q2 back into the demand function:\nP(Q) = 100 - 2(Q1 + Q2) = 100 - 2(15 + 15) = 100 - 2(30) = 100 - 60 = 40\n\nThe equilibrium market price is $40."
