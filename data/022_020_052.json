Find all values of $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$ for which there exists a non-trivial solution of this boundary value problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation $\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}+\\lambda u=0$. Depending on the sign of $\\lambda$, we have three cases:\n\n1. $\\lambda > 0$: In this case, let $\\lambda = k^2$ for some $k > 0$. The general solution is given by $u(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$.\n\n2. $\\lambda = 0$: In this case, the general solution is given by $u(x) = Ax + B$.\n\n3. $\\lambda < 0$: In this case, let $\\lambda = -k^2$ for some $k > 0$. The general solution is given by $u(x) = Ae^{kx} + Be^{-kx}$.\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)+\\alpha u'(1)=0$ to find the values of $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$ for which there exists a non-trivial solution.\n\n1. $\\lambda > 0$: Applying the boundary condition $u(0)=0$, we get $B=0$. So, $u(x) = A\\sin(kx)$. Now, applying the second boundary condition $u(1)+\\alpha u'(1)=0$, we get $A\\sin(k) + \\alpha Ak\\cos(k) = 0$. Since we are looking for non-trivial solutions, $A\\neq 0$. Thus, $\\sin(k) + \\alpha k\\cos(k) = 0$. This equation determines the relationship between $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$ for this case.\n\n2. $\\lambda = 0$: Applying the boundary condition $u(0)=0$, we get $B=0$. So, $u(x) = Ax$. Now, applying the second boundary condition $u(1)+\\alpha u'(1)=0$, we get $A + \\alpha = 0$. Since we are looking for non-trivial solutions, $A\\neq 0$. Thus, $\\alpha = -1$. In this case, there is only one value of $\\alpha$ that gives a non-trivial solution, and it is independent of $\\lambda$.\n\n3. $\\lambda < 0$: Applying the boundary condition $u(0)=0$, we get $A + B = 0$. So, $B = -A$ and $u(x) = A(e^{kx} - e^{-kx})$. Now, applying the second boundary condition $u(1)+\\alpha u'(1)=0$, we get $A(e^{k} - e^{-k}) + \\alpha A(ke^{k} + ke^{-k}) = 0$. Since we are looking for non-trivial solutions, $A\\neq 0$. Thus, $(e^{k} - e^{-k}) + \\alpha (ke^{k} + ke^{-k}) = 0$. This equation determines the relationship between $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$ for this case.\n\nIn summary, for each case, we have found an equation relating $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$ for which there exists a non-trivial solution of the given boundary value problem. These equations are:\n\n1. $\\sin(k) + \\alpha k\\cos(k) = 0$ for $\\lambda = k^2 > 0$.\n2. $\\alpha = -1$ for $\\lambda = 0$.\n3. $(e^{k} - e^{-k}) + \\alpha (ke^{k} + ke^{-k}) = 0$ for $\\lambda = -k^2 < 0$."
