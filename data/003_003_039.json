    "message_2": "To find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for the angle 135 degrees using the unit circle, we first need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. \n\nTo convert from degrees to radians, we use the formula:\n\nradians = (degrees × π) / 180\n\nSo, for 135 degrees:\n\nradians = (135 × π) / 180\nradians = (3π) / 4\n\nNow, we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent values for the angle (3π) / 4 radians using the unit circle.\n\nSince 135 degrees is in the second quadrant, we know that sine will be positive, cosine will be negative, and tangent will be negative.\n\nWe can use the reference angle, which is the angle between the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis. In this case, the reference angle is 45 degrees or π/4 radians.\n\nFor a 45-degree angle (π/4 radians), we know that:\n\nsin(π/4) = cos(π/4) = √2 / 2\n\nNow, we can find the sine and cosine values for the 135-degree angle (3π/4 radians):\n\nsin(3π/4) = sin(π/4) = √2 / 2\ncos(3π/4) = -cos(π/4) = -√2 / 2\n\nFinally, we can find the tangent value:\n\ntan(3π/4) = sin(3π/4) / cos(3π/4) = (√2 / 2) / (-√2 / 2) = -1\n\nSo, the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for the angle 135 degrees (3π/4 radians) are:\n\nsin(135°) = sin(3π/4) = √2 / 2\ncos(135°) = cos(3π/4) = -√2 / 2\ntan(135°) = tan(3π/4) = -1"
