    "message_1": "There are 50 students in a class. Among them, 20 students take Physics, 25 students take Chemistry and 30 students take Mathematics. If 10 students take both Physics and Chemistry, 12 students take both Physics and Mathematics, and 15 students take both Chemistry and Mathematics, then how many students take all the three subjects?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the number of students taking Physics, B be the number of students taking Chemistry, and C be the number of students taking Mathematics. Let X be the number of students taking all three subjects.\n\nAccording to the given information:\n\nA = 20\nB = 25\nC = 30\nA ∩ B = 10\nA ∩ C = 12\nB ∩ C = 15\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students taking at least one of the subjects:\n\nTotal students = A + B + C - (A ∩ B) - (A ∩ C) - (B ∩ C) + X\n\n50 = 20 + 25 + 30 - 10 - 12 - 15 + X\n\nNow, we can solve for X:\n\n50 = 53 - 37 + X\nX = 50 - 16\nX = 34\n\nSo, 34 students take all three subjects."
