    "message_2": "To determine the girth of the graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have 7 vertices and 10 edges, so the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum degree of a vertex in the graph. If the minimum degree is 1, then the graph would have a tree structure, and there would be no cycles. However, we know that there are 10 edges, which is more than the maximum number of edges in a tree with 7 vertices (6 edges). Therefore, the minimum degree must be at least 2.\n\nIf the minimum degree is 2, then we can create a graph with a cycle of length 3. For example, consider a graph with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and edges AB, BC, CA, AD, DE, EF, FD, EG, FG, and GA. This graph has a cycle of length 3 (ABC) and satisfies the condition of having 10 edges.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph is 3."
