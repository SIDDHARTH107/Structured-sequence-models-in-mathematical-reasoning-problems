    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and the bases measure 14 cm and 18 cm respectively. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the shorter base a (14 cm), the longer base b (18 cm), and the height h (8 cm). Let's also call the length of the left side c and the length of the right side d.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of c and d. Since the trapezium's height is perpendicular to both bases, we can form two right triangles by drawing the height from the shorter base to the longer base.\n\nTriangle 1 (left side):\nBase: (b - a) / 2 = (18 - 14) / 2 = 2 cm\nHeight: 8 cm\nHypotenuse (side c): ?\n\nTriangle 2 (right side):\nBase: (b - a) / 2 = (18 - 14) / 2 = 2 cm\nHeight: 8 cm\nHypotenuse (side d): ?\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) for both triangles:\n\nTriangle 1:\n2^2 + 8^2 = c^2\n4 + 64 = c^2\n68 = c^2\nc = √68 ≈ 8.246\n\nTriangle 2:\n2^2 + 8^2 = d^2\n4 + 64 = d^2\n68 = d^2\nd = √68 ≈ 8.246\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c + d\nPerimeter = 14 + 18 + 8.246 + 8.246\nPerimeter ≈ 48.492 cm"
