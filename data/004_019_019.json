    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the particle, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time (t). The velocity function, v(t), is given by:\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(4t^3 - 9t^2 - 12t)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = 12t^2 - 18t - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 2 seconds. Plug in t = 2 into the velocity function:\n\nv(2) = 12(2)^2 - 18(2) - 12\nv(2) = 12(4) - 36 - 12\nv(2) = 48 - 36 - 12\nv(2) = 12 - 12\nv(2) = 0\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 0 m/s.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the particle. The acceleration function, a(t), is given by the first derivative of the velocity function with respect to time (t):\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(12t^2 - 18t - 12)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 24t - 18\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at t = 2 seconds. Plug in t = 2 into the acceleration function:\n\na(2) = 24(2) - 18\na(2) = 48 - 18\na(2) = 30\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 30 m/sÂ²."
