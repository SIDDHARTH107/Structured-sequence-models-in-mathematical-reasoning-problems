    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has determined that the probability of a machine breakdown per day is 0.05. What is the probability that the machine will break down on two consecutive days?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of two independent events occurring consecutively, we multiply their individual probabilities. In this case, the probability of the machine breaking down on one day is 0.05, and the probability of it breaking down on the next day is also 0.05.\n\nSo, the probability of the machine breaking down on two consecutive days is:\n\n0.05 * 0.05 = 0.0025\n\nThe probability of the machine breaking down on two consecutive days is 0.0025 or 0.25%."
