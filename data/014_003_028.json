    "message_1": "Suppose Alice and Bob agree to use ElGamal encryption for securely sending messages. Assume that the public key is generated using the prime number p = 17 and a primitive root of p g = 3. Alice chooses a random integer a = 5 as her private key and calculates her corresponding public key A = g^a mod p. Bob chooses a random integer b = 9 as his private key and calculates his public key B = g^b mod p. If Alice wants to send the message M = 2 to Bob, what does she encrypt and send, and how does Bob decrypt it to recover the original message?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate Alice's and Bob's public keys A and B.\n\nA = g^a mod p = 3^5 mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 11\nB = g^b mod p = 3^9 mod 17 = 19683 mod 17 = 12\n\nNow, Alice wants to send the message M = 2 to Bob. To do this, she needs to calculate the ciphertext (C1, C2) using Bob's public key B.\n\nAlice chooses a random integer k, let's say k = 4. She calculates:\n\nC1 = g^k mod p = 3^4 mod 17 = 81 mod 17 = 13\nC2 = M * (B^k) mod p = 2 * (12^4) mod 17 = 2 * (20736) mod 17 = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nSo, the ciphertext Alice sends to Bob is (C1, C2) = (13, 2).\n\nNow, Bob needs to decrypt the ciphertext to recover the original message. He does this using his private key b and the received C1 value.\n\nM = C2 * (C1^b)^(-1) mod p\nFirst, calculate C1^b mod p:\nC1^b mod p = 13^9 mod 17 = 10604499373 mod 17 = 4\n\nNow, calculate the modular inverse of C1^b mod p:\n4^(-1) mod 17 = 13 (since 4 * 13 = 52 = 1 mod 17)\n\nFinally, calculate the original message M:\nM = C2 * (C1^b)^(-1) mod p = 2 * 13 mod 17 = 26 mod 17 = 9\n\nHowever, the decrypted message M = 9 does not match the original message M = 2. This is because the random integer k = 4 chosen by Alice is not coprime to p-1 = 16. To fix this, Alice should choose a different random integer k that is coprime to p-1.\n\nLet's try k = 3:\n\nC1 = g^k mod p = 3^3 mod 17 = 27 mod 17 = 10\nC2 = M * (B^k) mod p = 2 * (12^3) mod 17 = 2 * (1728) mod 17 = 2 * 8 = 16\n\nNow, the ciphertext Alice sends to Bob is (C1, C2) = (10, 16).\n\nBob decrypts the ciphertext:\n\nC1^b mod p = 10^9 mod 17 = 1000000000 mod 17 = 15\n15^(-1) mod 17 = 2 (since 15 * 2 = 30 = 1 mod 17)\n\nM = C2 * (C1^b)^(-1) mod p = 16 * 2 mod 17 = 32 mod 17 = 2\n\nNow, the decrypted message M = 2 matches the original message."
