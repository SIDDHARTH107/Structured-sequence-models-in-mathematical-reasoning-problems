    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the value of r:\n\nr = 1/2(1 + sqrt(5))\n\nr ≈ 1/2(1 + 2.236)\n\nr ≈ 1/2(3.236)\n\nr ≈ 1.618\n\nNow, we can calculate the area A using the formula A = 3π/8 * r^2:\n\nA ≈ 3π/8 * (1.618)^2\n\nA ≈ 3π/8 * 2.618\n\nA ≈ 3.14 * 0.979\n\nA ≈ 3.078\n\nSo, the area of the largest cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is approximately 3.078 square units."
