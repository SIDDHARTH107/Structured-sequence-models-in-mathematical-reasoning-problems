    "message_2": "To decrypt the message \"JXVNUSKSYSW\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is replaced by I): MATHSBCDEFGIKLOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nNow, the 5x5 matrix looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L O\nP Q R U V\nW X Y Z\n\nNext, we decrypt the message by breaking it into digraphs and applying the Playfair decryption rules:\n\n1. JX -> HE\n2. VN -> LL\n3. US -> O\n4. KS -> W\n5. YS -> OR\n\nThe decrypted message is \"HELLOWORLD\"."
