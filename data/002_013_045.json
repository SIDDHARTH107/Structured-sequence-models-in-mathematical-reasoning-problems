    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base with a length of 6 cm and a width of 4 cm, and its height is 8 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, you can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area can be found by multiplying the length and width of the base:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width = 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 24 cm² * 8 cm = (1/3) * 192 cm³ = 64 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 64 cubic centimeters."
