The company collects data from a sample of 50 employees and finds that the mean age is 35 years with a standard deviation of 5 years. Determine the 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all employees in the company.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all employees in the company, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Z-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nGiven:\nMean = 35 years\nStandard Deviation = 5 years\nSample Size = 50 employees\nZ-score for 95% confidence interval = 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 35 ± (1.96 * (5 / √50))\n\nConfidence Interval = 35 ± (1.96 * (5 / 7.071))\n\nConfidence Interval = 35 ± (1.96 * 0.7071)\n\nConfidence Interval = 35 ± 1.385\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all employees in the company is (33.615, 36.385) years. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true mean age of all employees in the company lies between 33.615 and 36.385 years."
