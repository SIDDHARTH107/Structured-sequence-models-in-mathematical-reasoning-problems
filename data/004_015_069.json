    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 2, we first need to find the second derivative of the function.\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), is found by taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x - 4\n\nNow, we find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x) with respect to x:\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x + 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x where f''(x) = 0.\n\n12x^2 - 24x + 12 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing by 12:\nx^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n(x - 1)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 is the only solution.\n\nTherefore, there is only one inflection point for the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 2, and it occurs at x = 1. To find the corresponding y-value, plug x = 1 into the original function:\n\nf(1) = (1)^4 - 4(1)^3 + 6(1)^2 - 4(1) + 2 = 1 - 4 + 6 - 4 + 2 = 1\n\nThus, the inflection point is at (1, 1)."
