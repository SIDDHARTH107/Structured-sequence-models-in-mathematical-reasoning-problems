    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext in ElGamal encryption, we need to calculate two values, C1 and C2.\n\nC1 = g^k mod p\nC2 = m * (y^k) mod p\n\nFirst, we need to compute the public key y:\ny = g^x mod p\ny = 3^5 mod 89\ny = 243 mod 89\ny = 54\n\nNow, we can compute C1 and C2:\nC1 = g^k mod p\nC1 = 3^8 mod 89\nC1 = 6561 mod 89\nC1 = 81\n\nC2 = m * (y^k) mod p\nC2 = 12 * (54^8) mod 89\nC2 = 12 * (40353607) mod 89\nC2 = 12 * 15 mod 89\nC2 = 180 mod 89\nC2 = 2\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext is (C1, C2) = (81, 2)."
