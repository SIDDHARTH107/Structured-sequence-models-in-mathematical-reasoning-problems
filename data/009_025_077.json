    "message_1": "Suppose that a stock has a current price of $100 and a volatility of 0.2. An option to purchase the stock in 3 months has a strike price of $110. If the risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum, use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to determine the price of the option.",
    "message_2": "To find the price of the option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we need to first calculate the values of d1 and d2, which are given by the following formulas:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + σ^2/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price = $100\nK = strike price = $110\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.05\nσ = volatility = 0.2\nT = time to expiration (in years) = 3 months = 0.25\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + 0.2^2/2) * 0.25) / (0.2 * sqrt(0.25))\nd1 = (-0.0953 + (0.05 + 0.02) * 0.25) / (0.2 * 0.5)\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.0175) / 0.1\nd1 = -0.777\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = -0.777 - 0.2 * 0.5\nd2 = -0.877\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to find the price of the option:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nwhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, we find:\n\nN(d1) = N(-0.777) = 0.2184\nN(d2) = N(-0.877) = 0.1901\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nCall option price = 100 * 0.2184 - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 0.25) * 0.1901\nCall option price = 21.84 - 110 * 0.9876 * 0.1901\nCall option price = 21.84 - 19.63\nCall option price = $2.21\n\nSo, the price of the option to purchase the stock in 3 months with a strike price of $110 is approximately $2.21."
