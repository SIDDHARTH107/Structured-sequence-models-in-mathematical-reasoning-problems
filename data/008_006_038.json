    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [2-λ 3; 4 1-λ]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\n|(A - λI)| = (2-λ)(1-λ) - (3)(4) = λ^2 - 3λ - 10\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 3λ - 10 = 0\n\nBy factoring, we get:\n\n(λ - 5)(λ + 2) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 5 and λ2 = -2.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 5:\n\n(A - 5I)v1 = 0\n[(-3) 3; 4 (-4)]v1 = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\n-3x + 3y = 0\n4x - 4y = 0\n\nWe can simplify the second equation to x - y = 0, which implies x = y. Let x = 1, then y = 1. So, the eigenvector v1 is:\n\nv1 = [1; 1]\n\nFor λ2 = -2:\n\n(A + 2I)v2 = 0\n[4 3; 4 3]v2 = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\n4x + 3y = 0\n4x + 3y = 0\n\nWe can simplify the first equation to 4x = -3y, which implies x = -3/4y. Let y = 4, then x = -3. So, the eigenvector v2 is:\n\nv2 = [-3; 4]\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are 5 and -2, with corresponding eigenvectors [1; 1] and [-3; 4]."
