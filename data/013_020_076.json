    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 participants in a beauty contest. Each participant can choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the contest is the one whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average number chosen by all participants. What number should each participant choose to increase their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the chances of winning, a participant should try to guess what the average number chosen by all participants will be and then choose a number that is 2/3 of that average.\n\nLet's assume that all participants are rational and will choose a number based on the same logic. If everyone thinks that the average number chosen will be 50 (since it's the midpoint of the range 0 to 100), then each participant should choose 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if everyone chooses 33.33, the new average will be 33.33, and the winning number would be 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22. If everyone realizes this and chooses 22.22, the new average will be 22.22, and the winning number would be 2/3 * 22.22 = 14.81.\n\nThis process of iteratively updating the chosen number will continue until it converges to a stable value. In this case, the stable value is 0, as choosing 0 will result in an average of 0, and 2/3 * 0 = 0. However, since choosing 0 is not a strict Nash equilibrium (as choosing a number slightly greater than 0 would make a participant win), participants should choose a number very close to 0 to maximize their chances of winning."
