    "message_1": "Consider a sealed-bid auction for a painting with two potential buyers: Alice and Bob. Each buyer has a different valuation of the painting, with Alice valuing it at $1000 and Bob valuing it at $800. The auctioneer will sell the painting to whoever bids the highest, with the winning bidder paying his or her bid amount. Assume that both Alice and Bob bid honestly, and that they are both risk-neutral (i.e., their decisions are based solely on expected values rather than risk). What bid should Alice submit to maximize her expected profit from the auction?",
    "message_2": "To maximize her expected profit, Alice should submit a bid slightly above Bob's valuation of the painting, which is $800. By bidding just above $800 (e.g., $800.01), Alice ensures that she will win the auction as long as Bob bids honestly and according to his valuation. This strategy allows Alice to pay the lowest possible price while still securing the painting, maximizing her profit (which is the difference between her valuation and the price she pays).\n\nIn this case, Alice's expected profit would be approximately $1000 - $800.01 = $199.99."
