    "message_2": "We need to find the number of ways to pair up the 12 teams into 6 games. To do this, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nThere are 12 teams, and we need to choose 2 teams for the first game. This can be done in 12 choose 2 ways, which is written as C(12, 2) or 12! / (2! * 10!). After the first game is set, we have 10 teams left.\n\nNow we need to choose 2 teams for the second game from the remaining 10 teams. This can be done in C(10, 2) or 10! / (2! * 8!) ways. We continue this process for all 6 games.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to organize the tournament is:\n\nC(12, 2) * C(10, 2) * C(8, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)\n\nHowever, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 6 games, which is 6! (since there are 6 games and each game can be arranged in any order).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n[C(12, 2) * C(10, 2) * C(8, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)] / 6!\n\n= [(12! / (2! * 10!)) * (10! / (2! * 8!)) * (8! / (2! * 6!)) * (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!))] / 6!\n\n= [12! / (2!^6)] / 6!\n\nNow we can cancel out some terms:\n\n= 12! / (2!^6 * 6!)\n\n= 12! / (2^6 * 6!)\n\n= 479001600 / (64 * 720)\n\n= 479001600 / 46080\n\n= 10395\n\nSo, there are 10,395 ways to organize the tournament so that each team plays exactly once in a round."
