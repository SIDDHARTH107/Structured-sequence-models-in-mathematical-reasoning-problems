    "message_1": "Unfortunately, epistemic logic is not numerical in nature and so it is hard to create a specific numerical problem for the student to solve. However, here's a question related to epistemic logic:\n\nSuppose youâ€™re on a TV show where there are three doors. Behind one door there's a prize, while the other two doors are empty. The host asks you to choose a door. After you make your choice, the host opens one of the other two doors, revealing it to be empty. The host then gives you the option to either stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining closed door. Is it advantageous to switch doors? How do you know?\n\nThis question relates to the concept of knowledge and belief, which are central to epistemic logic.",
    "message_2": "Yes, it is advantageous to switch doors. This problem is known as the Monty Hall problem, and we can understand the solution using probability.\n\nWhen you initially choose a door, there is a 1/3 chance that you have selected the door with the prize and a 2/3 chance that the prize is behind one of the other two doors. After the host reveals an empty door, the probabilities do not change. The door you initially chose still has a 1/3 chance of having the prize, while the remaining closed door has a 2/3 chance of having the prize.\n\nBy switching doors, you are effectively choosing the 2/3 probability of winning the prize instead of sticking with the 1/3 probability of your initial choice. Therefore, it is advantageous to switch doors, as it increases your chances of winning the prize from 1/3 to 2/3."
