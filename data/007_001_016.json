    "message_2": "The 50th prime number is 229. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and so on. To find the 50th prime number, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm or simply list out the prime numbers until you reach the 50th one."
