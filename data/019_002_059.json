    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the predicate formula P(x, y) when x = 3 and y = 7, we need to evaluate the statement \"If x is greater than 5, then y is less than 10.\"\n\nSince x = 3, the statement \"x is greater than 5\" is false. In an \"if-then\" statement, if the \"if\" part (also known as the antecedent) is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the \"then\" part (also known as the consequent).\n\nTherefore, the truth value of P(3, 7) is true."
