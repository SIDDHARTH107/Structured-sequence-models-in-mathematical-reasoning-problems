    "message_2": "To find the third point of intersection between the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 and the line L: y = 2x + 1 over the field F17, we first need to substitute the equation of the line L into the equation of the elliptic curve E.\n\nSubstituting L into E, we get:\n\n(2x + 1)^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n4x^2 + 4x + 1 = x^3 + 7x + 10\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 + 3x - 9 = 0 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation over the field F17. We can do this by trying all possible values of x from 0 to 16 and checking if the equation holds true.\n\nAfter testing all the values, we find that the equation holds true for x = 2, x = 6, and x = 13.\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding y-coordinates for these x-values using the equation of the line L: y = 2x + 1.\n\nFor x = 2, y = 2(2) + 1 = 5 (mod 17)\nFor x = 6, y = 2(6) + 1 = 13 (mod 17)\nFor x = 13, y = 2(13) + 1 = 9 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the three points of intersection are (2, 5), (6, 13), and (13, 9)."
