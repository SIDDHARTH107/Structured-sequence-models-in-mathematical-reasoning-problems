    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the circle $S^1$ at the basepoint $x_0 = (1,0)$, we will use the loop representation of the fundamental group. Recall that the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^1, x_0)$ is the set of homotopy classes of loops in $S^1$ based at $x_0$, with the group operation given by concatenation of loops.\n\nConsider a loop $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to S^1$ based at $x_0$. Since $S^1$ is the image of the continuous map $f(t) = (\\cos(2\\pi t), \\sin(2\\pi t))$, we can represent $\\gamma$ as a continuous map $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ such that $\\gamma(t) = f(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$. Note that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = \\tilde{\\gamma}(1) = 0$ since $\\gamma$ is a loop based at $x_0$.\n\nNow, consider two loops $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ in $S^1$ based at $x_0$, with corresponding continuous maps $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1$ and $\\tilde{\\gamma}_2$. The concatenation of these loops, denoted by $\\gamma_1 * \\gamma_2$, can be represented by the continuous map $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1 * \\tilde{\\gamma}_2: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ defined as follows:\n\n$$\n(\\tilde{\\gamma}_1 * \\tilde{\\gamma}_2)(t) = \\begin{cases}\n2\\tilde{\\gamma}_1(t) & \\text{if } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{1}{2}, \\\\\n2\\tilde{\\gamma}_2(t) - 1 & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2} < t \\leq 1.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis map is continuous and satisfies $(\\tilde{\\gamma}_1 * \\tilde{\\gamma}_2)(0) = (\\tilde{\\gamma}_1 * \\tilde{\\gamma}_2)(1) = 0$. Thus, the concatenation of loops in $S^1$ corresponds to the concatenation of continuous maps from $[0,1]$ to itself with the same endpoints.\n\nNow, we claim that the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^1, x_0)$ is isomorphic to the group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ under addition. To see this, consider the winding number of a loop $\\gamma$ around $x_0$. The winding number is an integer that counts the number of times $\\gamma$ winds around $x_0$ in the counterclockwise direction, with clockwise windings counted as negative. Given a loop $\\gamma$ with winding number $n$, we can construct a homotopy between $\\gamma$ and the loop that winds around $x_0$ exactly $n$ times. This shows that the winding number is a homotopy invariant, and thus, it induces a group homomorphism $w: \\pi_1(S^1, x_0) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nMoreover, the winding number homomorphism is surjective, as for any integer $n$, we can construct a loop $\\gamma_n$ that winds around $x_0$ exactly $n$ times. Finally, the winding number homomorphism is injective, as two loops with the same winding number are homotopic. Therefore, the winding number homomorphism is an isomorphism between $\\pi_1(S^1, x_0)$ and $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental group of the circle $S^1$ at the basepoint $x_0 = (1,0)$ is isomorphic to the group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ under addition, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^1, x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
