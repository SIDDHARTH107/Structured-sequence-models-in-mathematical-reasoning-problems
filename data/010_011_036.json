    "message_2": "Since M is connected, it has only one connected component. The Euler characteristic χ(M) is given by the formula:\n\nχ(M) = V - E + F,\n\nwhere V, E, and F are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces, respectively, in a triangulation of M.\n\nHowever, the Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, meaning it does not depend on the specific triangulation chosen. Therefore, if the Euler characteristic of M is -1, it will be -1 for any triangulation of M.\n\nSince M is a compact, connected, and orientable 2-dimensional manifold, it must be a closed surface. The only closed, connected, orientable surface with an Euler characteristic of -1 is the Klein bottle.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of connected components of M is 1, as M is connected and is topologically equivalent to the Klein bottle."
