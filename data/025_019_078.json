    "message_2": "To find the degree of the Fano variety represented by the intersection of these two hypersurfaces, we first need to determine the degrees of the individual hypersurfaces.\n\nThe first hypersurface is given by a quadratic equation in the variables $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$. Thus, its degree is 2.\n\nThe second hypersurface is also given by a quadratic equation in the variables $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$. Thus, its degree is also 2.\n\nNow, to find the degree of the intersection of these two hypersurfaces, we multiply their degrees: $2 \\times 2 = 4$. Therefore, the degree of the Fano variety represented by the intersection of these two hypersurfaces in projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is 4."
