    "message_2": "First, let's find A × B, which is the Cartesian product of A and B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∪ {1}. This is the union of the set A × B and the set {1}.\n\n(A × B) ∪ {1} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), 1}\n\nNext, let's find B ∪ {1}. This is the union of the sets B and {1}.\n\nB ∪ {1} = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find A × (B ∪ {1}).

Therefore, (A × B) ∪ {1} is not equal to A × (B ∪ {1})."
