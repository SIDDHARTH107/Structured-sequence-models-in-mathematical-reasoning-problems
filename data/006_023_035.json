    "message_1": "A certain supermarket chain conducted a survey and found that 30% of their customers buy organic products. The supermarket also found that 20% of their customers are vegetarian. If 10% of the customers are both organic buyers and vegetarian, what is the probability that a randomly selected customer is either an organic buyer or a vegetarian?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected customer is either an organic buyer or a vegetarian, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A represents the event of being an organic buyer, B represents the event of being a vegetarian, and A ∩ B represents the event of being both an organic buyer and a vegetarian.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\nP(A) = 0.30 (30% of customers buy organic products)\nP(B) = 0.20 (20% of customers are vegetarian)\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.10 (10% of customers are both organic buyers and vegetarian)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.30 + 0.20 - 0.10\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.40\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected customer is either an organic buyer or a vegetarian is 40%."
