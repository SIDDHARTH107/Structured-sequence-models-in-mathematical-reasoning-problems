    "message_1": "A cookie company offers 8 different types of cookies. You want to order 24 cookies and you want to have at least 2 cookies of each type. In how many possible ways can you order your cookies?",
    "message_2": "To ensure that you have at least 2 cookies of each type, you will first order 2 cookies of each of the 8 types. This accounts for 16 cookies (2 * 8 = 16). You now have 8 more cookies to order (24 - 16 = 8).\n\nNow, we can use the stars and bars method to distribute the remaining 8 cookies among the 8 types. We have 8 cookies (stars) and 7 dividers (bars) to separate them into 8 groups.\n\nWe will have a total of 15 positions (8 stars + 7 bars = 15). We need to choose 7 positions for the bars, and the remaining positions will be filled with stars.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 15 and k = 7.\n\nC(15, 7) = 15! / (7! * (15-7)!)\n\nC(15, 7) = 15! / (7! * 8!)\n\nC(15, 7) = 2002\n\nSo, there are 2002 possible ways to order your 24 cookies with at least 2 of each type."
