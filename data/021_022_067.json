    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem on Solving optimization problems using firefly algorithm:\n\nA company produces and sells 2 products, A and B. The production cost of A is 2 dollars per unit and B is 3 dollars per unit. The selling price of A and B is 4 dollars and 5 dollars per unit respectively. Based on market research, the company can sell up to 2000 units of product A and 1500 units of product B in a month. Using the firefly algorithm, determine the production and selling quantity of products A and B that maximizes the profit for the company in a month.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the firefly algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm.\n\nObjective function: The profit function is given by P(x, y) = (4 - 2)x + (5 - 3)y = 2x + 2y, where x is the number of units of product A and y is the number of units of product B.\n\nConstraints: \n1. x >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negative production quantities)\n2. x <= 2000 (maximum production of product A)\n3. y <= 1500 (maximum production of product B)\n\nParameters for the firefly algorithm:\n1. Number of fireflies: n (e.g., 50)\n2. Maximum generations: G (e.g., 100)\n3. Attraction coefficient: beta (e.g., 1)\n4. Absorption coefficient: gamma (e.g., 0.5)\n5. Randomization parameter: alpha (e.g., 0.2)\n\nNow, we can implement the firefly algorithm to find the optimal production quantities of products A and B that maximize the profit.\n\n1. Initialize n fireflies with random positions (x, y) within the constraints.\n2. Evaluate the profit function for each firefly.\n3. For each generation, do the following:\n   a. Rank the fireflies based on their profit values.\n   b. Update the position of each firefly by moving towards the brighter fireflies (higher profit) using the attraction, absorption, and randomization parameters.\n   c. Ensure the updated positions still satisfy the constraints.\n   d. Evaluate the profit function for the updated positions.\n   e. Repeat steps a-d for G generations.\n\nAfter G generations, the firefly with the highest profit value will provide the optimal production quantities for products A and B.\n\nNote: The firefly algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, and the solution may not be the exact optimal solution. However, it can provide a good approximation for the optimal solution."
