    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group of the Klein bottle K with Z coefficients, we will use the cellular cochain complex. The Klein bottle can be constructed using a 2-cell, two 1-cells, and one 0-cell. The cellular chain complex for the Klein bottle is given by:\n\n0 → Z → Z^2 → Z → 0\n\nwhere the first Z corresponds to the 0-cell, the Z^2 corresponds to the two 1-cells, and the last Z corresponds to the 2-cell.\n\nNow, we will compute the cochain complex, which is the dual of the chain complex:\n\n0 ← Z ← Z^2 ← Z ← 0\n\nThe second cohomology group H^2(K; Z) is given by the kernel of the map from Z to 0 divided by the image of the map from Z^2 to Z. Since the map from Z to 0 is the zero map, its kernel is Z. The image of the map from Z^2 to Z is generated by the boundary of the 2-cell, which is given by the attaching map of the Klein bottle:\n\n∂(2-cell) = a * b * a * b^(-1)\n\nwhere a and b are the generators of the two 1-cells.\n\nThe image of the map from Z^2 to Z is generated by the element a * b * a * b^(-1), which is a single element in Z. Therefore, the second cohomology group H^2(K; Z) is given by:\n\nH^2(K; Z) = Z / <a * b * a * b^(-1)>\n\nSince the element a * b * a * b^(-1) is nontrivial in the first homology group H_1(K; Z), it generates a nontrivial subgroup in the second cohomology group. Therefore, the second cohomology group H^2(K; Z) is isomorphic to Z."
