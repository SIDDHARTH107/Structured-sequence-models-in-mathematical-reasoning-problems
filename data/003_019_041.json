    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x) from x = 0 to x = π/2, we need to find the antiderivative of cos(x) and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe antiderivative of cos(x) is sin(x). Now, we need to evaluate sin(x) at the given limits:\n\n∫(cos(x) dx) from 0 to π/2 = sin(π/2) - sin(0)\n\nsin(π/2) = 1 and sin(0) = 0\n\nSo, the definite integral is:\n\n1 - 0 = 1\n\nThe value of the definite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x) from x = 0 to x = π/2 is 1."
