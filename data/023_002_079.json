If it converges, find the sum of the series at that point.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the Fourier series converges pointwise at x = π/2, we need to evaluate the series at that point. Let's plug x = π/2 into the series:\n\nf(π/2) = 2 + sin(π/2) - cos(π) + (1/2)sin(3π/2) + (2/3)cos(2π) - (1/4)sin(5π/2) + ...\n\nNow, let's evaluate each term:\n\nsin(π/2) = 1\ncos(π) = -1\nsin(3π/2) = -1\ncos(2π) = 1\nsin(5π/2) = 1\n...\n\nNotice that the sine and cosine functions have a period of 2π, so their values will repeat after every multiple of 2π. Therefore, the series will have a pattern of alternating sine and cosine terms with increasing odd integer coefficients.\n\nNow, let's sum up the series:\n\nf(π/2) = 2 + 1 - (-1) + (1/2)(-1) + (2/3)(1) - (1/4)(1) + ...\n\nf(π/2) = 2 + 1 + 1 - 1/2 + 2/3 - 1/4 + ...\n\nThe series converges, and we can find the sum by adding the terms:\n\nf(π/2) = 4 - 1/2 + 2/3 - 1/4\n\nTo add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12:\n\nf(π/2) = 4 - 6/12 + 8/12 - 3/12\n\nf(π/2) = 4 - 1/12\n\nf(π/2) = 47/12\n\nSo, the Fourier series converges pointwise at x = π/2, and the sum of the series at that point is 47/12."
