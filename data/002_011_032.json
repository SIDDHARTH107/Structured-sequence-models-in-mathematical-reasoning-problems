    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg with a length of 3 cm, and the hypotenuse has a length of 5 cm. What is the length of the other leg using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nIn this problem, we are given one leg (a) with a length of 3 cm, and the hypotenuse (c) with a length of 5 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nUsing the given values, we can write the equation as:\n\n3² + b² = 5²\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\n9 + b² = 25\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\nb² = 16\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √16\n\nb = 4\n\nSo, the length of the other leg (b) is 4 cm."
