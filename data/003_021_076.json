    "message_1": "A plane is flying at a velocity of 500 km/h due north. At the same time, the wind is blowing southward at a velocity of 80 km/h. What is the angle between the velocity of the plane and the resultant velocity of the plane with respect to the ground? Use trigonometry to solve.",
    "message_2": "Let Vp be the velocity of the plane (500 km/h due north) and Vw be the velocity of the wind (80 km/h due south). We want to find the angle θ between the velocity of the plane and the resultant velocity of the plane with respect to the ground (Vr).\n\nSince the wind is blowing in the opposite direction, we can represent the situation as a right triangle, where Vp is the vertical side, Vw is the horizontal side, and Vr is the hypotenuse.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity:\n\nVr^2 = Vp^2 + Vw^2\nVr^2 = (500 km/h)^2 + (80 km/h)^2\nVr^2 = 250000 + 6400\nVr^2 = 256400\nVr = √256400\nVr ≈ 506.36 km/h\n\nNow, we can use trigonometry to find the angle θ. We will use the tangent function, which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(θ) = Vw / Vp\ntan(θ) = 80 km/h / 500 km/h\ntan(θ) = 0.16\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse tangent (arctangent) of 0.16:\n\nθ = arctan(0.16)\nθ ≈ 9.09°\n\nSo, the angle between the velocity of the plane and the resultant velocity of the plane with respect to the ground is approximately 9.09°."
