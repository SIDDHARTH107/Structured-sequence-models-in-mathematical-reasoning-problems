    "message_1": "A furniture company produces chairs and tables. The company has 10 workers available and 500 hours of work available per week. Each chair requires 4 hours of work and each table requires 5 hours of work. The company's profit is $50 for each chair sold and $70 for each table sold. If the company wants to maximize its profit per week, how many chairs and tables should it produce? Note that the company can only produce whole numbers of chairs and tables.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced per week.\n\nThe total hours of work constraint is given by:\n4x + 5y ≤ 500\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit, which is given by:\nProfit = 50x + 70y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the integer linear programming method. However, we can also solve this problem using a more intuitive approach by analyzing the constraints and the profit function.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of chairs (x) and tables (y) that can be produced within the 500-hour constraint:\n\nIf the company only produces chairs:\n4x ≤ 500\nx ≤ 125\n\nIf the company only produces tables:\n5y ≤ 500\ny ≤ 100\n\nNow, we can analyze the profit function and check the possible combinations of chairs and tables that maximize the profit. Since the profit per table is higher than the profit per chair, we should prioritize producing tables.\n\nStarting with the maximum number of tables (100), we can check if there's any remaining time to produce chairs. If we produce 100 tables, we would use 500 hours of work, leaving no time for chairs. However, we can try reducing the number of tables and see if we can fit chairs in the remaining time.\n\nLet's try producing 99 tables:\n5 * 99 = 495 hours\nRemaining time: 500 - 495 = 5 hours\n\nWith 5 hours left, we can produce 1 chair:\n4 * 1 = 4 hours\n\nSo, the company can produce 99 tables and 1 chair within the 500-hour constraint. The total profit would be:\nProfit = 50 * 1 + 70 * 99 = 50 + 6930 = $6980\n\nThis is the maximum profit the company can achieve per week by producing 1 chair and 99 tables."
