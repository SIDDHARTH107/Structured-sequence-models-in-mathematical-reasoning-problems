    "message_2": "First, we need to find the critical points of the Morse function $f(x,y,z,w) = z^2 - w^2$. The critical points occur when the gradient of $f$ is zero. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\nabla f = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial w}\\right) = (0, 0, 2z, -2w).\n$$\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we get $z = 0$ and $w = 0$. However, since $M = \\mathbb{RP}^3$, we cannot have both $z$ and $w$ equal to zero simultaneously. Therefore, there are two critical points: $(x, y, 0, w)$ and $(x, y, z, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the index of these critical points. The Hessian matrix of $f$ is given by:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFor the critical point $(x, y, 0, w)$, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe index of this critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which is 1.\n\nFor the critical point $(x, y, z, 0)$, the Hessian matrix is the same, and the index is also 1.\n\nNow we can apply the Morse inequalities:\n\n$$\nB_k \\leq N_k.\n$$\n\nSince $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a 3-dimensional manifold, we have the following Betti numbers: $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$, and $B_3$. We found two critical points with index 1, so $N_1 = 2$. For the other indices, there are no critical points, so $N_0 = N_2 = N_3 = 0$.\n\nApplying the Morse inequalities, we get:\n\n$$\nB_0 \\leq 0 \\Rightarrow B_0 = 0,\n$$\n\n$$\nB_1 \\leq 2 \\Rightarrow B_1 = 0 \\text{ or } B_1 = 2,\n$$\n\n$$\nB_2 \\leq 0 \\Rightarrow B_2 = 0,\n$$\n\n$$\nB_3 \\leq 0 \\Rightarrow B_3 = 0.\n$$\n\nHowever, since $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ is connected, we must have $B_0 = 1$. Therefore, the Betti numbers of $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ are:\n\n$$\nB_0 = 1, \\quad B_1 = 2, \\quad B_2 = 0, \\quad B_3 = 0.\n$$"
