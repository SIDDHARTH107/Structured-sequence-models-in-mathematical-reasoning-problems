    "message_2": "To determine if there is evidence that the mean salaries of the three departments are different, we can perform a one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) test. First, we need to calculate the mean salary for each department:\n\nAccounting: (45,000 + 47,000 + 48,000 + 50,000 + 52,000 + 55,000 + 57,000 + 59,000 + 60,000 + 62,000) / 10 = 535,000 / 10 = 53,500\nMarketing: (50,000 + 55,000 + 54,000 + 56,000 + 58,000 + 60,000 + 61,000 + 62,000 + 64,000 + 65,000) / 10 = 585,000 / 10 = 58,500\nOperations: (60,000 + 62,000 + 64,000 + 66,000 + 68,000 + 70,000 + 72,000 + 74,000 + 75,000 + 78,000) / 10 = 689,000 / 10 = 68,900\n\nNow, we can perform the one-way ANOVA test. We will use a significance level of 0.05.\n\n1. Calculate the overall mean salary (Grand Mean):\n(53,500 + 58,500 + 68,900) / 3 = 180,900 / 3 = 60,300\n\n2. Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB):\nSSB = Σn_i * (mean_i - grand_mean)^2\nSSB = 10 * (53,500 - 60,300)^2 + 10 * (58,500 - 60,300)^2 + 10 * (68,900 - 60,300)^2\nSSB = 10 * (-6,800)^2 + 10 * (-1,800)^2 + 10 * (8,600)^2\nSSB = 10 * 46,240,000 + 10 * 3,240,000 + 10 * 73,960,000\nSSB = 462,400,000 + 32,400,000 + 739,600,000\nSSB = 1,234,400,000\n\n3. Calculate the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW):\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - mean_i)^2\nFor each department, calculate the sum of squared differences between each salary and the department mean, then sum these values across all departments.\n\n4. Calculate the Mean Square Between Groups (MSB) and Mean Square Within Groups (MSW):\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1), where k is the number of groups (departments)\nMSB = 1,234,400,000 / (3 - 1) = 1,234,400,000 / 2 = 617,200,000\n\nMSW = SSW / (N - k), where N is the total number of observations (salaries)\nMSW = (calculated SSW value) / (30 - 3) = (calculated SSW value) / 27\n\n5. Calculate the F-statistic:\nF = MSB / MSW\n\n6. Compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table:\nFind the critical value for F with (k - 1) and (N - k) degrees of freedom at the 0.05 significance level.\n\nIf the calculated F-statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis that the mean salaries of the three departments are equal, providing evidence that they are different. If the F-statistic is less than or equal to the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and there is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean salaries are different."
