    "message_2": "To calculate the probability, we need to know the number of successful outcomes (rolling a number greater than 2) and the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number on a six-sided dice).\n\nThere are 4 successful outcomes: rolling a 3, 4, 5, or 6.\nThere are 6 possible outcomes: rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is the ratio of successful outcomes to possible outcomes:\n\nP(rolling a number greater than 2) = (number of successful outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes) = 4/6 = 2/3\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a standard six-sided dice is 2/3 or approximately 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)."
