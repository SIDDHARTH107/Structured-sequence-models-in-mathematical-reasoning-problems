    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group H^2(X, Z) of the algebraic variety X defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 in projective 3-space P^3, we can use the fact that X is a smooth quadric hypersurface in P^3. \n\nFirst, we note that X is isomorphic to the projective space P^1 x P^1, which can be seen by considering the map:\n\nφ: X → P^1 x P^1, (x : y : z) ↦ ((x : y), (x : z))\n\nThis map is well-defined and bijective, and its inverse is given by:\n\nφ^(-1): P^1 x P^1 → X, ((a : b), (c : d)) ↦ (ac : ad + bc : bd)\n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology of X by using the Künneth formula for the cohomology of a product of spaces:\n\nH^k(X, Z) ≅ H^k(P^1 x P^1, Z) ≅ ⊕_(i + j = k) H^i(P^1, Z) ⊗ H^j(P^1, Z)\n\nThe cohomology of P^1 is well-known:\n\nH^0(P^1, Z) = Z\nH^1(P^1, Z) = 0\nH^2(P^1, Z) = Z\n\nNow, we can compute the second cohomology group H^2(X, Z):\n\nH^2(X, Z) ≅ H^0(P^1, Z) ⊗ H^2(P^1, Z) ⊕ H^1(P^1, Z) ⊗ H^1(P^1, Z) ⊕ H^2(P^1, Z) ⊗ H^0(P^1, Z)\n\nSince H^1(P^1, Z) = 0, the middle term vanishes, and we are left with:\n\nH^2(X, Z) ≅ H^0(P^1, Z) ⊗ H^2(P^1, Z) ⊕ H^2(P^1, Z) ⊗ H^0(P^1, Z)\n\nH^2(X, Z) ≅ Z ⊗ Z ⊕ Z ⊗ Z\n\nH^2(X, Z) ≅ Z ⊕ Z\n\nSo, the second cohomology group H^2(X, Z) of the algebraic variety X is isomorphic to Z ⊕ Z."
