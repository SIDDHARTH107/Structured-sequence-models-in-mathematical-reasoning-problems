    "message_1": "Unfortunately, I cannot provide a precise numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic as it involves dealing with contradictory statements and truth values, which cannot be reduced to a numerical problem. However, I can provide a sample question related to paraconsistent logic:\n\nSuppose there are two statements: \"X is true\" and \"X is false.\" In paraconsistent logic, how would you approach the truth value of these statements?",
    "message_2": "In paraconsistent logic, we can deal with contradictory statements without the system collapsing into triviality (i.e., without every statement being considered true). To approach the truth value of the statements \"X is true\" and \"X is false,\" we would use a four-valued logic system, such as Belnap's four-valued logic.\n\nIn Belnap's four-valued logic, there are four truth values: True (T), False (F), Both (B), and Neither (N). The truth value of a statement can be any combination of these four values. For example, a statement can be True and False at the same time, which is represented as Both (B).\n\nIn the case of the statements \"X is true\" and \"X is false,\" we would assign the truth value Both (B) to X. This means that X is considered to be both true and false simultaneously. This approach allows us to handle contradictions without the system becoming trivial, as it does not imply that every statement is true."
