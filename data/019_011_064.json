    "message_2": "In relevance logic, the truth value of a conditional statement \"p ⇒ q\" depends on the relevance between the antecedent (p) and the consequent (q). Unlike classical logic, where a false antecedent implies a true consequent, relevance logic requires a connection between p and q for the implication to be true.\n\nGiven that p is false and q is true, we cannot determine the truth value of \"p ⇒ q\" in relevance logic without knowing the relevance between p and q. If there is a relevant connection between p and q, then \"p ⇒ q\" would be true; otherwise, it would be false."
