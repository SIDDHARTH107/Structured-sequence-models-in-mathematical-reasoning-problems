    "message_2": "To find the probability of choosing a machine that causes accidents, you need to divide the number of machines that cause accidents by the total number of machines.\n\nProbability = (Number of machines that cause accidents) / (Total number of machines)\n\nProbability = 10 / 100\n\nProbability = 1 / 10\n\nSo the probability of choosing a machine that causes accidents in the workplace is 1/10 or 0.1 (which can be expressed as 10% if you prefer percentages)."
