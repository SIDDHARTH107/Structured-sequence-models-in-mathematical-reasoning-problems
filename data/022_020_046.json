    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given partial differential equation as:\n\n$(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y)) = -1$\n\nDividing both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -1$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$\n\n$Y''(y) - (k^2 + 1)Y(y) = 0$\n\nSolving the first ODE for X(x), we get:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = -\\cos(x)$, we get:\n\n$-\\cos(x) = X(x)Y(0) = (A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx))Y(0)$\n\nSince this must hold for all x, we have:\n\n$Y(0) = -1$\n\n$A = 1$\n\n$B = 0$\n\nSo, $X(x) = \\cos(kx)$.\n\nNow, let's solve the second ODE for Y(y):\n\n$Y''(y) - (k^2 + 1)Y(y) = 0$\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$r^2 - (k^2 + 1) = 0$\n\n$r = \\pm\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}$\n\nSo, the general solution for Y(y) is:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}y) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}y)$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(x, \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin(x)$, we get:\n\n$\\sin(x) = X(x)Y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\cos(kx)(C\\cosh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\\frac{\\pi}{2}))$\n\nSince this must hold for all x, we have:\n\n$C\\cosh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$\n\n$D\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $C = 0$. From the second equation, we get:\n\n$D = \\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\\frac{\\pi}{2})}$\n\nSo, the solution for Y(y) is:\n\n$Y(y) = \\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}y)$\n\nFinally, the complex-valued solution of the boundary value problem is:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = \\cos(kx)\\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 1}y)$\n\nwhere k is a complex constant."
