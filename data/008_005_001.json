    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix reduction methods, we first need to write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  5 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 |  7 ]\n[ 3  2 -1 |  2 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row reduction (Gaussian elimination) to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times Row 1 from Row 2, and subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  5 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -3 ]\n[ 0 -1 -4 | -13 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide Row 2 by -3:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  5 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  1 ]\n[ 0 -1 -4 | -13 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Add Row 2 to Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1  1   1  |  5 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  1 ]\n[ 0  0 -11/3 | -12 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Multiply Row 3 by -3/11:\n\n```\n[ 1  1   1  |  5 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  1 ]\n[ 0  0   1  |  4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 4.\n\nSubstituting z into the second row, we get y - (1/3)(4) = 1, which gives y = 1 + (4/3) = 7/3.\n\nFinally, substituting y and z into the first row, we get x + (7/3) + 4 = 5, which gives x = 5 - (7/3) - 4 = -2/3.\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = -2/3, y = 7/3, and z = 4."
