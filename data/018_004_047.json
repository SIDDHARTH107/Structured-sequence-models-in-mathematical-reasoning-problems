    "message_2": "To find the complement of set B, we need to find all the elements that are in the universal set U but not in set B. Since set A is given, we can assume that set A represents the universal set U in this context. \n\nThe complement of set B, denoted as B', can be found by subtracting the elements of set B from set A:\n\nB' = A - B = {1, 3, 5, 7} - {3, 5} = {1, 7}\n\nSo, the complement of set B is B' = {1, 7}.\n\nTo show that it is unique, we need to prove that there is no other set that can be the complement of set B in the context of set A as the universal set. \n\nSuppose there is another set C that is also a complement of set B. Then, C should also satisfy the condition that it contains all the elements in set A but not in set B. However, we have already found the complement of set B, which is B' = {1, 7}. Since set A has only 4 elements and we have already removed the elements of set B, there are no other elements left in set A to form another complement set. Therefore, the complement of set B is unique, and it is B' = {1, 7}."
