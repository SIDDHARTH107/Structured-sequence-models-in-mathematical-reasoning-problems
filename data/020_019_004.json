    "message_2": "Since the boat must always face towards point B, it must travel in a straight line from point A to point B. To find the distance between point A and point B, we can use the distance formula:\n\nDistance = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of point A (0, 0) and point B (3, 4):\n\nDistance = √((3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2)\nDistance = √(3^2 + 4^2)\nDistance = √(9 + 16)\nDistance = √25\nDistance = 5 meters\n\nNow that we have the distance, we can find the time it takes for the boat to travel from point A to point B using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nThe maximum speed of the boat is 8 m/s, so:\n\nTime = 5 meters / 8 m/s\nTime = 0.625 seconds\n\nThe fastest route for the boat to travel from point A to point B is a straight line, and it will take 0.625 seconds to complete the journey at its maximum speed of 8 m/s."
