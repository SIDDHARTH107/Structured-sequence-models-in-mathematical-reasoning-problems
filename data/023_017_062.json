    "message_1": "A metal bar is placed in a fluid, and the temperature of the bar at each point in time is measured. The temperature function f(x, t) is known to be periodic with a period of 2L in the x-direction. Find the Fourier series representation of the temperature function, and determine the coefficients for the first three non-zero terms. If the initial temperature distribution is given by f(x, 0) = sin(x), find the temperature distribution at time t = pi/8.",
    "message_2": "Since the temperature function f(x, t) is periodic with a period of 2L in the x-direction, we can represent it as a Fourier series:\n\nf(x, t) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nGiven the initial temperature distribution f(x, 0) = sin(x), we can find the Fourier coefficients by integrating over one period (from -L to L) and using the orthogonality properties of sine and cosine functions:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x, 0) * 1] dx from -L to L = 0 (since sin(x) is an odd function)\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x, 0) * cos(n * π * x / L)] dx from -L to L = 0 (since sin(x) * cos(nx) is an odd function)\n\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x, 0) * sin(n * π * x / L)] dx from -L to L\n\nFor n = 1, b_1 = (1/L) * ∫[sin(x) * sin(π * x / L)] dx from -L to L\n\nSince f(x, 0) = sin(x), we have b_1 = 1. For other n, b_n = 0.\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of the temperature function is:\n\nf(x, t) = sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the temperature distribution at time t = π/8. Since the temperature function does not depend on time, the temperature distribution at t = π/8 is the same as the initial temperature distribution:\n\nf(x, π/8) = sin(x)"
