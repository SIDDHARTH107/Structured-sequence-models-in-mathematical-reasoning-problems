    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a consumer buying a certain product in a market is 0.3. In a random sample of 50 consumers, what is the probability that exactly 20 will buy the product?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, consumers buying the product)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as \"n choose k\"\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of consumers in the sample, which is 50)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of consumers buying the product, which is 20)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a consumer buying the product, which is 0.3)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a consumer not buying the product, which is 0.7)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 20) = C(50, 20) * (0.3)^20 * (0.7)^(50-20)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(50, 20), which is the number of combinations of 50 items taken 20 at a time:\n\nC(50, 20) = 50! / (20! * (50-20)!)\nC(50, 20) = 50! / (20! * 30!)\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that C(50, 20) = 47,129,212.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 20) = 47,129,212 * (0.3)^20 * (0.7)^30 â‰ˆ 0.1398\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 20 out of 50 consumers will buy the product is approximately 0.1398 or 13.98%."
