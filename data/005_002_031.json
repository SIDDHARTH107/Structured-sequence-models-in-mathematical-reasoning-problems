    "message_1": "The heights of a random sample of 50 apple trees in a particular orchard are measured, and the sample mean is found to be 8.5 feet with a standard deviation of 1.2 feet. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of apple trees in the orchard.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of apple trees in the orchard, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value is based on the desired level of confidence (95% in this case) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 1.2 / √(50) = 1.2 / 7.071 = 0.1697\n\nNext, we need to find the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. For a 95% confidence interval, the critical value (z-score) is approximately 1.96.\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 8.5 ± (1.96 * 0.1697)\nConfidence Interval = 8.5 ± 0.3329\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of apple trees in the orchard is approximately (8.1671, 8.8329) feet."
