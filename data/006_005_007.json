    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, bulbs lasting more than 1000 hours)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 10 bulbs)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 7 bulbs lasting more than 1000 hours)\n- p is the probability of a single success (in this case, 0.7)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a single failure (in this case, 0.3)\n\nPlugging in the values for this problem:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3\n\nFirst, we calculate C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 bulbs out of 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / (5040 * 6)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / 30240\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n0.7^7 = 0.0823543\n0.3^3 = 0.027\n\nNow, multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.0823543 * 0.027\nP(X = 7) â‰ˆ 0.2668\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 7 out of 10 bulbs will last more than 1000 hours is approximately 0.2668 or 26.68%."
