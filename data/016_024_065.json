    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from an initial large square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed. This process is repeated for the remaining 8 squares.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there is 1 large square removed, leaving 8 squares.\nAfter the second iteration, each of the 8 squares has 1 square removed, leaving 8 * 8 = 64 squares.\nAfter the third iteration, each of the 64 squares has 1 square removed, leaving 8 * 64 = 512 squares.\nAfter the fourth iteration, each of the 512 squares has 1 square removed, leaving 8 * 512 = 4096 squares.\n\nSo, after the fourth iteration, there are 4096 squares in the Sierpinski carpet."
