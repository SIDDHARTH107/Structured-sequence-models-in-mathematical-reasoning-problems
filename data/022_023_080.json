Also, $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$ for all $t>0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other only on $t$. So, let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. \n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) - 4X''(x)T(t) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $T''(t) + \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$\n\n2) $X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4} X(x) = 0$\n\nwith boundary conditions $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$. \n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem. The general solution is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}x) + B\\cos(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n$X(0) = B = 0$\n\n$X(\\pi) = A\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\pi) = 0$\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (trivial solution), we must have:\n\n$\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\pi = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nSo, $\\lambda_n = 2n$ and $X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(2nx)$.\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation. The general solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2nt) + D_n\\sin(2nt)$\n\nSince $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$, we have:\n\n$0 = -2nC_n\\sin(2nx) + 2nD_n\\cos(2nx)$\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we must have $D_n = 0$. So, $T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2nt)$.\n\nNow, the general solution is:\n\n$u_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = C_n\\sin(2nx)\\cos(2nt)$\n\nTo satisfy the initial condition $u(x,0) = 2\\sin(2x)$, we have:\n\n$2\\sin(2x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin(2nx)$\n\nComparing the terms, we see that $C_1 = 2$ and $C_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 1$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = 2\\sin(2x)\\cos(2t)$"
