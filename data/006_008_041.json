    "message_2": "A standard dice has 6 faces, each with an equal probability of landing face up. Since there is only one face with the number 6, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1 out of 6 possible outcomes. \n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667 (rounded to four decimal places)."
