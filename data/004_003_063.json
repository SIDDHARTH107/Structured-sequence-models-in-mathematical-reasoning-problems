    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the garden is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 120 meters of fencing, we can write:\n\n120 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we can solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (120 - 2L) / 2\nW = 60 - L\n\nThe area of the garden is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nSubstitute W from the previous equation:\n\nArea = L * (60 - L)\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum area. To do this, we can take the derivative of the area function with respect to L and set it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dL = d(L * (60 - L))/dL\n\nUsing the product rule:\n\nd(Area)/dL = (60 - L) - L\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for L:\n\n0 = (60 - L) - L\n0 = 60 - 2L\n2L = 60\nL = 30\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 60 - L\nW = 60 - 30\nW = 30\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that maximize its area are 30 meters by 30 meters, and the maximum area is 30 * 30 = 900 square meters."
