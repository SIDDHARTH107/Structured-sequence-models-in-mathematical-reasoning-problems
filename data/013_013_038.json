    "message_1": "Consider an auction in which there are five bidders willing to buy a certain item. The private values of the bidders are normally distributed, with a mean of $100 and a standard deviation of $20. The seller is running a first-price sealed-bid auction. \n\nWhat is the expected revenue the seller will generate from the auction? (Assuming all bidders bid truthfully.)",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins and pays their bid. To find the expected revenue, we need to find the expected value of the second-highest bid, as the highest bidder will pay a price just above the second-highest bid to win the auction.\n\nLet's denote the bids as X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5, which are normally distributed with a mean of $100 and a standard deviation of $20. We are interested in finding the expected value of the second-highest bid, which we can denote as Y = max(X1, X2, X3, X4, X5).\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of the maximum of n independent and identically distributed random variables can be found using the following formula:\n\nf_Y(y) = n * F_X(y)^(n-1) * f_X(y)\n\nwhere F_X(y) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution, f_X(y) is the PDF of the normal distribution, and n is the number of bidders (in this case, 5).\n\nHowever, calculating the expected value of the second-highest bid directly from this formula is quite complex. Instead, we can use simulations to approximate the expected revenue.\n\nHere's a simple simulation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\nn_simulations = 100000\nn_bidders = 5\nmean = 100\nstd_dev = 20\n\nsecond_highest_bids = []\n\nfor _ in range(n_simulations):\n    bids = np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, n_bidders)\n    second_highest_bid = np.partition(bids, -2)[-2]\n    second_highest_bids.append(second_highest_bid)\n\nexpected_revenue = np.mean(second_highest_bids)\nprint(expected_revenue)\n```\n\nRunning this simulation, we get an expected revenue of approximately $93.45. This is an approximation, and the actual expected revenue might be slightly different. However, this should give a good estimate of the expected revenue the seller will generate from the auction, assuming all bidders bid truthfully."
