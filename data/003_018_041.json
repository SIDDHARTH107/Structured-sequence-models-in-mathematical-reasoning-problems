    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(5x) + 2cos(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe derivative of sin(ax) with respect to x is acos(ax) * a, and the derivative of cos(ax) with respect to x is -asin(ax) * a.\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x, dy/dx, is:\n\ndy/dx = d(3sin(5x))/dx + d(2cos(2x))/dx\ndy/dx = 3 * 5 * cos(5x) - 2 * 2 * sin(2x)\ndy/dx = 15cos(5x) - 4sin(2x)\n\nNow, we'll find the value of the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 15cos(5(π/6)) - 4sin(2(π/6))\ndy/dx(π/6) = 15cos(5π/6) - 4sin(π/3)\n\nNow, we'll find the values of cos(5π/6) and sin(π/3):\n\ncos(5π/6) = -√3/2\nsin(π/3) = √3/2\n\nNow, we'll substitute these values into the expression for dy/dx(π/6):\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 15(-√3/2) - 4(√3/2)\ndy/dx(π/6) = -15√3/2 - 4√3/2\ndy/dx(π/6) = -19√3/2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 3sin(5x) + 2cos(2x) at x = π/6 is -19√3/2."
