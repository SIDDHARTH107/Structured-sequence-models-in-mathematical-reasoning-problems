    "message_2": "To find the Cartan connection $\\omega$ of the 3-dimensional manifold $M$, we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} + \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l})$$\n\nwhere $g^{kl}$ are the components of the inverse metric tensor. Since the metric tensor $g$ is diagonal, its inverse is also diagonal, with components $g^{11} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $g^{22} = \\frac{1}{4}$, and $g^{33} = 1$.\n\nNow, we compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric components are constant, their partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates are zero. Therefore, all the Christoffel symbols are zero:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$$\n\nThe Cartan connection $\\omega$ is a 1-form valued in the Lie algebra of the frame bundle, which can be identified with the tangent space at the point $(1,0,0)$. In local coordinates, the Cartan connection can be written as:\n\n$$\\omega = \\omega^k_i dx^i \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}$$\n\nwhere $\\omega^k_i$ are the components of the Cartan connection. These components are related to the Christoffel symbols by:\n\n$$\\omega^k_i = \\Gamma^k_{ij} dx^j$$\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols are zero, the components of the Cartan connection are also zero:\n\n$$\\omega^k_i = 0$$\n\nThus, the Cartan connection $\\omega$ of the 3-dimensional manifold $M$ at the point $(1,0,0)$ is:\n\n$$\\omega = 0$$"
