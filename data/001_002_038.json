    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (5, 2), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The formula for the slope is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (x1, y1) = (3, 4) and (x2, y2) = (5, 2), we can plug in the values:\n\nm = (2 - 4) / (5 - 3)\nm = (-2) / 2\nm = -1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the slope m = -1 and the point (3, 4):\n\ny - 4 = -1(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\ny = -1(x - 3) + 4\ny = -x + 3 + 4\ny = -x + 7\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (5, 2) is:\n\ny = -x + 7"
