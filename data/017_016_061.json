    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 27, its order can be written as 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal. In this case, G would be a cyclic group of order 27, which contradicts our assumption that G is not cyclic. Therefore, n_3 must be equal to 27.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. The only groups of order 9 are isomorphic to either C_9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C_3 × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). In either case, P is an abelian group.\n\nNow, let N be the normalizer of P in G. By definition, N is the largest subgroup of G containing P such that P is normal in N. Since P is abelian, P is normal in N. By the Sylow theorems, the index of N in G, denoted by [G : N], is equal to n_3 = 27. Thus, |N| = |G| / 27 = 1, which implies that N = P.\n\nLet Q be another Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since n_3 = 27, there are 27 distinct Sylow 3-subgroups in G, and all of them are conjugate to P. Therefore, there exists an element g in G such that gPg^(-1) = Q. Since P is normal in G, we have gPg^(-1) = P, and thus Q = P.\n\nNow, let x and y be two distinct elements in G that are not in P. Since G is not cyclic, the subgroup generated by x and y, denoted by <x, y>, must have order greater than 9. Since |G| = 27, the order of <x, y> must be 27. Thus, G = <x, y>.\n\nSince P is normal in G, we have xPx^(-1) = P and yPy^(-1) = P. Therefore, for any elements p1, p2 in P, we have:\n\nx(p1 * p2)x^(-1) = (xp1x^(-1)) * (xp2x^(-1))\n\nSimilarly, for any elements q1, q2 in Q, we have:\n\ny(q1 * q2)y^(-1) = (yq1y^(-1)) * (yq2y^(-1))\n\nNow, let z = xy. Then, for any elements p1, p2 in P, we have:\n\nz(p1 * p2)z^(-1) = (xy)(p1 * p2)(yx)^(-1) = xyp1p2x^(-1)y^(-1) = (xp1x^(-1))(yp2y^(-1))\n\nSince z(p1 * p2)z^(-1) ≠ (zp1z^(-1)) * (zp2z^(-1)), G is non-abelian.\n\nFinally, we have shown that G is a non-abelian group of order 27, generated by two elements x and y, with a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
