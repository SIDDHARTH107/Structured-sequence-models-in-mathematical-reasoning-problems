    "message_2": "To minimize the number of bags, we should try to maximize the number of balls in each bag without violating the given conditions. Since no bag can contain more than 3 balls, we can start by filling bags with 3 balls each:\n\n1. Bag 1: 3 balls\n2. Bag 2: 3 balls\n3. Bag 3: 3 balls\n4. Bag 4: 3 balls\n5. Bag 5: 3 balls\n\nAt this point, we have used 5 bags and packed 15 tennis balls. We still have 1 tennis ball left. We cannot add it to any of the existing bags, as that would violate the condition that no two bags have the same number of balls. Therefore, we need an additional bag:\n\n6. Bag 6: 1 ball\n\nSo, the minimum number of bags required is 6.\n\nNow, let's determine the treewidth of the resulting graph. In this case, the graph would be a star graph with 6 vertices (5 bags with 3 balls and 1 bag with 1 ball). The center vertex represents the bag with 1 ball, and the other 5 vertices represent the bags with 3 balls each.\n\nThe treewidth of a star graph with n vertices is 1. This is because we can form a tree decomposition with two bags: one containing the center vertex and any leaf vertex, and the other containing the center vertex and a different leaf vertex. This tree decomposition has width 2 (two vertices in each bag) minus 1, which equals 1.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of the resulting graph is 1."
