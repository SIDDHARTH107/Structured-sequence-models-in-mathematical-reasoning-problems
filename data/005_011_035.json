    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to test the effectiveness of 3 different laundry detergents on removing stains. The manufacturer randomly divides 60 stained white shirts into three equal groups of 20. Then, each group of shirts is washed separately using 1 of the 3 detergents. Finally, the amount of stain remaining on each shirt is measured. The following table shows the mean and standard deviation of stain removal for each detergent group. Calculate the variance and coefficient of variation for each group:\n\n| Detergent | Mean (%) | Standard Deviation |\n|-----------|----------|--------------------|\n| A         | 98       | 1                  |\n| B         | 94       | 2                  |\n| C         | 92       | 3                  |",
    "message_2": "To calculate the variance for each group, we square the standard deviation. The coefficient of variation is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nDetergent A:\nVariance = (Standard Deviation)^2 = (1)^2 = 1\nCoefficient of Variation = (Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100 = (1 / 98) * 100 = 1.02%\n\nDetergent B:\nVariance = (Standard Deviation)^2 = (2)^2 = 4\nCoefficient of Variation = (Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100 = (2 / 94) * 100 = 2.13%\n\nDetergent C:\nVariance = (Standard Deviation)^2 = (3)^2 = 9\nCoefficient of Variation = (Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100 = (3 / 92) * 100 = 3.26%\n\nSo, the results are:\n\n| Detergent | Mean (%) | Standard Deviation | Variance | Coefficient of Variation (%) |\n|-----------|----------|--------------------|----------|------------------------------|\n| A         | 98       | 1                  | 1        | 1.02                         |\n| B         | 94       | 2                  | 4        | 2.13                         |\n| C         | 92       | 3                  | 9        | 3.26                         |"
