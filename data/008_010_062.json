    "message_2": "First, we will write the given system of linear equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |  5 ]\n[  4  -2   2 | -6 ]\n[ -3   0   1 |  3 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we will replace the second row with (-2 * first row + second row):\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |  5 ]\n[  0  -8   4 | -16 ]\n[ -3   0   1 |  3 ]\n```\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we will replace the third row with ((3/2) * first row + third row):\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |  5 ]\n[  0  -8   4 | -16 ]\n[  0   4.5 -1.5| 10.5 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we will replace the third row with ((-9/8) * second row + third row):\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |  5 ]\n[  0  -8   4 | -16 ]\n[  0   0  -1 |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nThe third row represents the equation -z = 1, so z = -1.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it into the second row to solve for y:\n\n-8y + 4(-1) = -16\n\n-8y - 4 = -16\n\n-8y = -12\n\ny = 1.5\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of y and z into the first row to solve for x:\n\n2x + 3(1.5) - (-1) = 5\n\n2x + 4.5 + 1 = 5\n\n2x = -0.5\n\nx = -0.25\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -0.25, y = 1.5, and z = -1."
