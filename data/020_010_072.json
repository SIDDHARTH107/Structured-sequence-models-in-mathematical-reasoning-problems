    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces two types of products, A and B. The profit earned from selling one unit of product A is $10, and that from selling one unit of product B is $15. The plant's daily production capacity is 1000 units. Due to uncertainty in demand, the plant wants to ensure a minimum daily profit of $8000. Using Robust optimization, determine how many units of each product the plant should produce to achieve this goal.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 1000 (production capacity constraint)\n2. 10x + 15y ≥ 8000 (minimum daily profit constraint)\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo use robust optimization, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the uncertain demand. In this case, we can assume that the demand for product A is at its lowest when the demand for product B is at its highest, and vice versa.\n\nLet's first consider the case where the demand for product A is at its lowest and the demand for product B is at its highest. In this case, we want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 1000\n2. 10x + 15y ≥ 8000\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can graph the feasible region and find the corner points. The corner points are (0, 800), (0, 1000), and (200, 800). Evaluating the profit function at these points, we get:\n\nP(0, 800) = 10(0) + 15(800) = 12000\nP(0, 1000) = 10(0) + 15(1000) = 15000\nP(200, 800) = 10(200) + 15(800) = 14000\n\nThe maximum profit in this case is $15,000, which occurs when producing 0 units of product A and 1000 units of product B.\n\nNow let's consider the case where the demand for product A is at its highest and the demand for product B is at its lowest. In this case, we want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 1000\n2. 10x + 15y ≥ 8000\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe corner points are (800, 0), (1000, 0), and (800, 200). Evaluating the profit function at these points, we get:\n\nP(800, 0) = 10(800) + 15(0) = 8000\nP(1000, 0) = 10(1000) + 15(0) = 10000\nP(800, 200) = 10(800) + 15(200) = 11000\n\nThe maximum profit in this case is $11,000, which occurs when producing 800 units of product A and 200 units of product B.\n\nSince we want to ensure a minimum daily profit of $8000, we should choose the production plan that gives us the highest minimum profit. In this case, the plant should produce 800 units of product A and 200 units of product B, which will ensure a minimum daily profit of $11,000."
