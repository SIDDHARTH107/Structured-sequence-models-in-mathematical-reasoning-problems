    "message_2": "To find the vertex of a parabola given by the equation y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b / 2a. Then, we can plug this value back into the equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -8, and c = 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the x-coordinate of the vertex:\nx = -(-8) / (2 * 2)\nx = 8 / 4\nx = 2\n\nNow, let's find the y-coordinate by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\ny = 2(2)^2 - 8(2) + 5\ny = 2(4) - 16 + 5\ny = 8 - 16 + 5\ny = -8 + 5\ny = -3\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (2, -3)."
