    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of conformal blocks for a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) on X with gauge group SO(3), we can use the Verlinde formula. The Verlinde formula computes the dimension of the space of conformal blocks in terms of the fusion rules of the chiral algebra associated with the TQFT.\n\nThe Verlinde formula is given by:\n\ndim(V) = ∑_k N_k * S_{0k} * S_{ik} / S_{0i}\n\nwhere V is the space of conformal blocks, N_k are the fusion coefficients, and S_{ij} are the elements of the modular S-matrix. The indices i and k label the primary fields of the chiral algebra, and the sum is over all primary fields.\n\nFor a TQFT with gauge group SO(3), the chiral algebra is the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model at level k. The primary fields are labeled by the spins j = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., k/2, and the fusion coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the SO(3) group.\n\nThe modular S-matrix for the WZW model at level k is given by:\n\nS_{ij} = √{2 / (k + 2)} * sin(π * (i + 1) * (j + 1) / (k + 2))\n\nNow, let's compute the dimension of the space of conformal blocks for the given problem. The length of each geodesic on the closed surface X of genus 2 is equal to 2. This implies that the level k of the WZW model is equal to 1. Therefore, the primary fields are labeled by the spins j = 0 and j = 1/2.\n\nUsing the Verlinde formula, we have:\n\ndim(V) = ∑_k N_k * S_{0k} * S_{ik} / S_{0i}\n\nSince the level k is equal to 1, there are two primary fields with spins j = 0 and j = 1/2. The fusion coefficients N_k are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the SO(3) group:\n\nN_0 = 1 (for j = 0)\nN_1/2 = 0 (for j = 1/2)\n\nThe modular S-matrix elements are given by:\n\nS_{00} = √{2 / (1 + 2)} * sin(π * (0 + 1) * (0 + 1) / (1 + 2)) = √{2 / 3} * sin(π / 3) = √{2 / 3}\nS_{01/2} = √{2 / (1 + 2)} * sin(π * (0 + 1) * (1/2 + 1) / (1 + 2)) = √{2 / 3} * sin(π / 2) = √{2 / 3}\nS_{10} = S_{01/2} = √{2 / 3}\nS_{11/2} = √{2 / (1 + 2)} * sin(π * (1 + 1) * (1/2 + 1) / (1 + 2)) = √{2 / 3} * sin(2π / 3) = -√{2 / 3}\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of the space of conformal blocks using the Verlinde formula:\n\ndim(V) = N_0 * S_{00} * S_{00} / S_{00} + N_1/2 * S_{01/2} * S_{11/2} / S_{00}\n       = 1 * (√{2 / 3})^2 / (√{2 / 3}) + 0 * (√{2 / 3}) * (-√{2 / 3}) / (√{2 / 3})\n       = 2 / 3\n\nSince the dimension of the space of conformal blocks must be an integer, we conclude that the dimension is equal to 0. This means that there are no conformal blocks for a TQFT on X with gauge group SO(3) and the given Riemannian metric."
