    "message_2": "To determine if the function is analytic, we first need to check if it is differentiable. Since $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3$ is a polynomial function, it is differentiable everywhere in the complex plane, including at $z = 1 + 2i$. Therefore, the function is analytic at $z = 1 + 2i$.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^2 - 2z + 3) = 2z - 2$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the derivative at the point $z = 1 + 2i$:\n\n$f'(1 + 2i) = 2(1 + 2i) - 2 = 2 + 4i - 2 = 4i$\n\nSo, the derivative of the function $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3$ at the point $z = 1 + 2i$ is $f'(1 + 2i) = 4i$."
