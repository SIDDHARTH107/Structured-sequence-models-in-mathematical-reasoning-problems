    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the cereal box, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (485 grams)\nt = t-score (based on the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom, which is n-1)\ns = sample standard deviation (20 grams)\nn = sample size (40)\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score. Since we want a 95% confidence interval and our sample size is 40, we have 39 degrees of freedom (n-1). Using a t-table or a calculator, we find that the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 39 degrees of freedom is approximately 2.023.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 485 ± (2.023 * (20 / √40))\n\nCI = 485 ± (2.023 * (20 / 6.325))\n\nCI = 485 ± (2.023 * 3.162)\n\nCI = 485 ± 6.4\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the cereal box is approximately (478.6, 491.4) grams. This means that we are 95% confident that the true mean weight of the cereal boxes lies between 478.6 grams and 491.4 grams."
