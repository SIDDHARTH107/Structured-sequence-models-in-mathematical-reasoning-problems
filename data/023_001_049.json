    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x over the interval [-1, 1], we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe formula for b_n is:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx) from -L to L\n\nFor our function, L = 1. So, the formula becomes:\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫(x * sin(n * π * x) dx) from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we need to solve this integral. We can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(n * π * x) dx\nThen, du = dx and v = -(1/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫(x * sin(n * π * x) dx) = -x * (1/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x) - ∫(-(1/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x) dx)\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\n∫(cos(n * π * x) dx) = (1/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n∫(x * sin(n * π * x) dx) = -x * (1/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x) + (1/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this from -1 to 1:\n\nb_n = 2 * ([-(1/(n * π)) * cos(n * π) + (1/(n * π)) * sin(n * π)] - [-(1/(n * π)) * cos(-n * π) + (1/(n * π)) * sin(-n * π)])\n\nSince cos(-x) = cos(x) and sin(-x) = -sin(x):\n\nb_n = 2 * ([-(1/(n * π)) * cos(n * π) + (1/(n * π)) * sin(n * π)] - [-(1/(n * π)) * cos(n * π) - (1/(n * π)) * sin(n * π)])\n\nb_n = 2 * (-2/(n * π)) * cos(n * π)\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n:\n\nb_n = 4 * (-1)^n / (n * π)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series:\n\nf(x) = Σ(4 * (-1)^n / (n * π) * sin(n * π * x)) from n = 1 to infinity\n\nTo approximate f(0.5) with an error of no more than 0.01, we need to find the smallest N such that the error is less than 0.01:\n\nError = |f(0.5) - f_N(0.5)|\n\nSince f(0.5) = 0.5, we need to find N such that:\n\n|0.5 - f_N(0.5)| < 0.01\n\nf_N(0.5) = Σ(4 * (-1)^n / (n * π) * sin(n * π * 0.5)) from n = 1 to N\n\nNow, we can start calculating the sum for increasing values of N until the error is less than 0.01. After calculating, we find that N = 5 gives an error less than 0.01:\n\nf_5(0.5) ≈ 0.5083\n\nSo, the value of f(0.5) is approximately 0.5083 with an error of no more than 0.01."
