    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly, where two firms produce identical products with the same constant marginal cost of $10 per unit. The market demand for the product is given by Q = 2000 - P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price. What will be the equilibrium quantity and price for each firm in the Cournot equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. Let q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2. \n\nFrom the demand function, we can find the price as a function of quantity: P = 2000 - Q = 2000 - (q1 + q2).\n\nThe revenue for each firm can be calculated as the product of price and quantity: R1 = P * q1 = (2000 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 and R2 = P * q2 = (2000 - (q1 + q2)) * q2.\n\nThe profit for each firm is the difference between revenue and cost: π1 = R1 - 10 * q1 and π2 = R2 - 10 * q2.\n\nNow we can find the first-order conditions for profit maximization for each firm by taking the partial derivatives with respect to their respective quantities:\n\n∂π1/∂q1 = ∂((2000 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 10 * q1)/∂q1 = 2000 - 2*q1 - q2 - 10\n∂π2/∂q2 = ∂((2000 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 10 * q2)/∂q2 = 2000 - 2*q2 - q1 - 10\n\nSetting the first-order conditions equal to zero and solving for the reaction functions:\n\nq1 = 995 - 0.5*q2\nq2 = 995 - 0.5*q1\n\nNow we can solve for the Cournot equilibrium quantities by substituting one reaction function into the other:\n\nq1 = 995 - 0.5*(995 - 0.5*q1)\nq1 = 995 - 497.5 + 0.25*q1\n0.75*q1 = 497.5\nq1 = 663.33\n\nNow substitute q1 back into the reaction function for q2:\n\nq2 = 995 - 0.5*663.33\nq2 = 663.33\n\nSo, in the Cournot equilibrium, both firms produce 663.33 units. To find the equilibrium price, substitute the equilibrium quantities back into the price function:\n\nP = 2000 - (q1 + q2) = 2000 - (663.33 + 663.33) = 2000 - 1326.66 = 673.34\n\nThus, the Cournot equilibrium quantities for each firm are 663.33 units, and the equilibrium price is $673.34."
