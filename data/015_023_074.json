    "message_2": "The Chirikov-Taylor map, also known as the standard map, is a 2D area-preserving map defined by the following equations:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n + y_n+1 (mod 1)\ny_n+1 = y_n + K * sin(2 * π * x_n) (mod 1)\n\nwhere x_n and y_n are the coordinates of the phase space, n is the iteration number, and K is the parameter value.\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent λ for the Chirikov-Taylor map can be estimated numerically by calculating the average growth rate of the distance between two initially close trajectories after a large number of iterations. The formula for the Lyapunov exponent is:\n\nλ = (1/N) * Σ(log(Δy_n+1 / Δy_n))\n\nwhere N is the number of iterations, Δy_n is the distance between the two trajectories at iteration n, and Σ denotes the sum over all iterations.\n\nFor K = 1.5, the Chirikov-Taylor map is in the chaotic regime. The exact value of the Lyapunov exponent depends on the initial conditions and the number of iterations used for the calculation. However, for K = 1.5, the Lyapunov exponent is typically found to be approximately 0.1.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an approximate value, and the actual Lyapunov exponent may vary depending on the specific initial conditions and the number of iterations used in the calculation."
