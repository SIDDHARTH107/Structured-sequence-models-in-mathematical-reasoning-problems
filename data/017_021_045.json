    "message_2": "To determine the center of a non-abelian group of order 48, we first need to understand the structure of the group. Let G be a non-abelian group of order 48. The order of G can be factored as 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 16 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFrom condition 1, we see that n_2 can be either 1 or 3. From condition 2, we see that n_3 can be either 1, 4, or 16.\n\nNow, let's consider the center of G, denoted as Z(G). The center of a group is the set of all elements that commute with every element in the group. In other words, Z(G) = {g ∈ G | gx = xg for all x ∈ G}. We want to determine if Z(G) is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element) or non-trivial.\n\nSuppose that Z(G) is non-trivial. Then, by the class equation, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C_G(x)],\n\nwhere the sum is taken over a set of representatives x of the non-central conjugacy classes, and C_G(x) denotes the centralizer of x in G.\n\nSince G is non-abelian, |Z(G)| < |G|. Also, |G:C_G(x)| divides |G|, so it must be a multiple of 2, 3, or 6. If |G:C_G(x)| = 2, then C_G(x) has index 2 in G, which implies that C_G(x) is a normal subgroup of G. However, this would mean that G has a non-trivial normal subgroup, contradicting the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, |G:C_G(x)| must be a multiple of 3 or 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for n_3:\n\n1. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. This contradicts the assumption that G is non-abelian.\n\n2. If n_3 = 4 or 16, then there are at least 4 distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. Each of these subgroups has order 3, so they have 2 non-identity elements. Since the Sylow 3-subgroups are distinct, there are at least 4 * 2 = 8 non-identity elements of order 3 in G. Since |G:C_G(x)| must be a multiple of 3 or 6, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + 3a + 6b,\n\nwhere a and b are non-negative integers. Since |Z(G)| > 1 (as we assumed Z(G) is non-trivial), we have:\n\n48 > 1 + 3a + 6b.\n\nHowever, this inequality implies that there are fewer than 8 non-identity elements of order 3 in G, which contradicts the fact that there are at least 8 such elements.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, we reach a contradiction when assuming that Z(G) is non-trivial. Hence, the center of a non-abelian group of order 48 must be trivial."
