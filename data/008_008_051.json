    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of finishing time, while each unit of Product B requires 1 hour of assembly time and 3 hours of finishing time. The assembly department has 70 hours of labor available per week, and the finishing department has 90 hours of labor available per week. The profit for each unit of Product A is $30 and for each unit of Product B is $50. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce per week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the assembly and finishing departments can be represented as linear inequalities:\n\n2x + y ≤ 70 (assembly time constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 90 (finishing time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 30x + 50y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Solve each inequality for y:\n\ny ≤ 70 - 2x (assembly time constraint)\ny ≤ (90 - x) / 3 (finishing time constraint)\n\n2. Determine the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. It is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (35, 0), and (20, 20).\n\n3. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 30(0) + 50(0) = $0\nP(0, 30) = 30(0) + 50(30) = $1500\nP(35, 0) = 30(35) + 50(0) = $1050\nP(20, 20) = 30(20) + 50(20) = $1600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 20 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $1600 per week."
