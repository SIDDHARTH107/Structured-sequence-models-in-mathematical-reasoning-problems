    "message_1": "A metal plate of dimensions 2 meters by 3 meters is heated to 100°C on one side and kept at 0°C on the other side. Using the Fourier transform, determine the temperature distribution across the plate after 5 minutes, given that the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 m²/s. Assume the initial temperature of the plate is 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the 2D heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The 2D heat equation is:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α (∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and y are the spatial coordinates.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. T(0, y, t) = 100°C for 0 ≤ y ≤ 3\n2. T(2, y, t) = 0°C for 0 ≤ y ≤ 3\n3. T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 3, t) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2\n\nThe initial condition is:\nT(x, y, 0) = 25°C for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 3\n\nWe can solve this problem using separation of variables and Fourier series. Let T(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation and dividing by αXYT, we get:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T/∂t = (1/X) ∂²X/∂x² + (1/Y) ∂²Y/∂y²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n(1/X) ∂²X/∂x² = -λ\n(1/Y) ∂²Y/∂y² = -λ\n(1/αT) ∂T/∂t = -λ\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nX(x) = C1sin(√λx) + C2cos(√λx)\nY(y) = C3sin(√λy) + C4cos(√λy)\nT(t) = C5e^(-αλt)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n1. T(0, y, t) = 100°C => C2(C3sin(√λy) + C4cos(√λy))C5e^(-αλt) = 100\n2. T(2, y, t) = 0°C => C1sin(2√λ)(C3sin(√λy) + C4cos(√λy))C5e^(-αλt) = 0\n3. T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 3, t) => X(x)(C3sin(0) + C4cos(0))C5e^(-αλt) = X(x)(C3sin(3√λ) + C4cos(3√λ))C5e^(-αλt)\n\nFrom condition 2, we get that sin(2√λ) = 0, which implies that λ = (nπ/2)² for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFrom condition 3, we get that C4 = C3sin(3√λ) / cos(3√λ), which implies that Y(y) = C3cos(√λy)tan(3√λ).\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution as a sum of Fourier series:\n\nT(x, y, t) = Σ [A_n cos(nπx/2) cos(nπy/6) e^(-α(nπ/2)²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition:\n\n25 = Σ [A_n cos(nπx/2) cos(nπy/6)]\n\nWe can find A_n by multiplying both sides by cos(mπx/2) cos(mπy/6) and integrating over the domain:\n\nA_m = (4/9) ∫∫ [25 cos(mπx/2) cos(mπy/6)] dx dy, for m = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nAfter calculating the coefficients A_n, we can find the temperature distribution T(x, y, t) after 5 minutes (t = 300 seconds)."
