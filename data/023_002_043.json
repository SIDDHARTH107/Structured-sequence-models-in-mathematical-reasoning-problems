    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients.\n\nThe Fourier series of a function f(x) on the interval [-π, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFor f(x) = x^2, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx = (1/3) * π^2\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\nUsing integration by parts twice, we get:\na_n = (2/π) * [(π^2 * cos(nπ) - 2 * sin(nπ))/n^2] = (2/π) * [(π^2 * (-1)^n - 0)/n^2] = (2 * (-1)^n * π^2) / (n^2 * π)\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * sin(nx) dx = 0 (since x^2 is an even function and sin(nx) is an odd function)\n\nThus, the Fourier series of f(x) = x^2 is given by:\n\nf(x) = (1/3) * π^2 + Σ [(2 * (-1)^n * π^2) / (n^2 * π) * cos(nx)]\n\nNow, we need to check the convergence of this Fourier series. Since f(x) = x^2 is a continuous and piecewise smooth function on the interval [-π, π], its Fourier series converges to the function at every point in the interval. Moreover, the convergence is uniform on the interval.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π] converges to the function itself."
