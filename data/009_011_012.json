    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation and then find the time it takes for the number of infected individuals to reach 200.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ndP/dt = 0.1P(1 - P/400)\n\nFirst, we'll separate the variables:\n\n(1/P(1 - P/400)) dP = 0.1 dt\n\nNow, we'll integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P(1 - P/400)) dP = ∫0.1 dt\n\nTo integrate the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let:\n\n1/P(1 - P/400) = A/P + B/(1 - P/400)\n\n1 = A(1 - P/400) + B(P)\n\nNow, we'll solve for A and B:\n\nIf P = 0, then:\n\n1 = A(1 - 0) + B(0) => A = 1\n\nIf P = 400, then:\n\n1 = A(0) + B(400) => B = 1/400\n\nNow we can rewrite the integral:\n\n∫(1/P + 1/(400(1 - P/400))) dP = ∫0.1 dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\nln|P| - ln|1 - P/400| = 0.1t + C\n\nNow, we'll use the initial condition P(0) = 20:\n\nln|20| - ln|1 - 20/400| = C\n\nln|20| - ln|1 - 1/20| = C\n\nln|20| - ln|19/20| = C\n\nC = ln(20) - ln(19/20)\n\nNow we have the general solution:\n\nln|P| - ln|1 - P/400| = 0.1t + ln(20) - ln(19/20)\n\nNow, we'll find the time it takes for the number of infected individuals to reach 200:\n\nln|200| - ln|1 - 200/400| = 0.1t + ln(20) - ln(19/20)\n\nln|200| - ln|1/2| = 0.1t + ln(20) - ln(19/20)\n\nln(400) - ln(2) = 0.1t + ln(20) - ln(19/20)\n\nln(400) - ln(2) = 0.1t + ln(20) - ln(19) + ln(20)\n\n0.1t = ln(400) - ln(2) - ln(20) + ln(19) - ln(20)\n\n0.1t = ln(400/2) - ln(20) + ln(19)\n\n0.1t = ln(200) - ln(20) + ln(19)\n\nt = 10(ln(200) - ln(20) + ln(19))\n\nt ≈ 10(5.298 - 2.996 + 2.944)\n\nt ≈ 10(5.246)\n\nt ≈ 52.46\n\nIt will take approximately 52.46 days for the number of infected individuals to reach 200."
