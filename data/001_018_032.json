    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms:\n\n1. log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b)\n2. log(a^n) = n * log(a)\n\nApplying these properties, we get:\n\nlog(base 5) (125x^3/125y^2z) = log(base 5) (125x^3) - log(base 5) (125y^2z)\n\nNow, we can apply the second property:\n\nlog(base 5) (125x^3) = 3 * log(base 5) (125x) = 3 * (log(base 5) (125) + log(base 5) (x))\nlog(base 5) (125y^2z) = log(base 5) (125) + 2 * log(base 5) (y) + log(base 5) (z)\n\nSince 125 is 5^3, the logarithm simplifies further:\n\n3 * (log(base 5) (125) + log(base 5) (x)) = 3 * (3 + log(base 5) (x)) = 9 + 3 * log(base 5) (x)\nlog(base 5) (125y^2z) = 3 + 2 * log(base 5) (y) + log(base 5) (z)\n\nNow, we can substitute these simplified expressions back into the original equation:\n\nlog(base 5) (125x^3/125y^2z) = (9 + 3 * log(base 5) (x)) - (3 + 2 * log(base 5) (y) + log(base 5) (z))\n\nFinally, we can combine the constants and the logarithmic terms:\n\nlog(base 5) (125x^3/125y^2z) = 6 + 3 * log(base 5) (x) - 2 * log(base 5) (y) - log(base 5) (z)"
