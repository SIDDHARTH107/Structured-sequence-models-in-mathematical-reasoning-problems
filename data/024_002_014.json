    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between points A and B along a geodesic on the surface of the sphere, we need to know the angle between the two points with respect to the center of the sphere. Let's denote this angle as θ.\n\nOnce we have the angle θ, we can use the formula for the arc length of a circle to find the shortest distance (geodesic) between A and B:\n\nArc length = radius × angle (in radians)\n\nIn this case, the radius of the sphere is 5. So, the formula becomes:\n\nShortest distance (geodesic) = 5 × θ\n\nHowever, without knowing the coordinates of points A and B or the angle θ between them, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer for the shortest distance between A and B along a geodesic on the surface of the sphere."
