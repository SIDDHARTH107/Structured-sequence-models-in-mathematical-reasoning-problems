Suppose that $F$ is equipped with a homology class $A\\in H_2(M, \\partial M)$, and let $\\omega$ be a closed 1-form on $M$ (not necessarily non-degenerate).

Assume that $u$ contributes to $HF^*(M,\\omega,A)$.

    "message_2": "Let $V$ be a small tubular neighborhood of $F$ in $M$, and let $\\pi: V \\to F$ be the projection map. Since $u(S^1) \\subset F$, we have $\\pi \\circ u = u$. Now, consider the map $u': S^1 \\to TM$ given by $u'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}u(t)$. Since $u$ is a non-constant solution to the Floer equation, $u'(t)$ is non-zero for all $t \\in S^1$. \n\nWe claim that there exists a point $p \\in \\partial V$ such that the tangent space to $\\partial V$ at $p$ is identically equal to $u'(0)$. To see this, let $p = u(0)$, and note that $u'(0) \\in T_pF$. Since $V$ is a tubular neighborhood of $F$, there exists a unique vector $v_p \\in T_p\\partial V$ such that $\\pi_*v_p = u'(0)$. We will show that $u'(0) = v_p$.\n\nFirst, observe that $u'(0) \\in T_pF$ implies that $u'(0) \\in T_pV$. Moreover, since $u'(0) \\neq 0$, we have that $u'(0) \\notin T_p\\partial V$. Thus, $u'(0)$ and $v_p$ are linearly independent vectors in $T_pV$. Since $\\dim T_pV = 3$, it follows that $T_p\\partial V$ is the unique 2-dimensional subspace of $T_pV$ containing $u'(0)$ and $v_p$. Therefore, we must have $u'(0) = v_p$.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists a point $p \\in \\partial V$ such that the tangent space to $\\partial V$ at $p$ is identically equal to $u'(0)$."
