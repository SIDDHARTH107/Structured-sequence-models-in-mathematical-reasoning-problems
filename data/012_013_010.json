    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G, we need to determine the number of ways to color the graph using k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nThe given graph G has the following edges: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1). This graph can be represented as a pentagon with an additional diagonal edge connecting vertices 2 and 4.\n\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of the graph G. We will use the deletion-contraction method to find the chromatic polynomial.\n\n1. Choose an edge, say (1,2), and delete it from the graph. The remaining graph G' has edges (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1). This graph is a pentagon, and its chromatic polynomial is P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2).\n\n2. Now, contract the edge (1,2) in the original graph G. This results in a new graph G'' with 4 vertices and edges (1,3), (1,4), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1). This graph is a square with a diagonal edge. Its chromatic polynomial is P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\n3. Finally, apply the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k).\n\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2)] - [k(k-1)(k-2)].\n\nFactor out k(k-1)(k-2) from both terms:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)[(k-3) + 1 - 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)."
