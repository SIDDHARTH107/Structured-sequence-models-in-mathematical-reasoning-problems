    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products - Product A and Product B. The profit per unit of Product A is $40 and for Product B it is $60. The amount of time required to produce one unit of A is 3 hours while for B it is 5 hours. The factory has a total of 200 hours available for production. The demand for Product A is at least twice that of Product B. What is the number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. Profit per unit of Product A is $40 and for Product B is $60.\n2. Time required to produce one unit of A is 3 hours and for B is 5 hours.\n3. The factory has a total of 200 hours available for production.\n4. The demand for Product A is at least twice that of Product B.\n\nFrom the given information, we can form the following equations:\n\n1. Profit = 40x + 60y\n2. Time constraint: 3x + 5y ≤ 200\n3. Demand constraint: x ≥ 2y\n\nOur goal is to maximize the profit function (40x + 60y) subject to the given constraints.\n\nFirst, let's solve the demand constraint for x:\n\nx = 2y\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the time constraint equation:\n\n3(2y) + 5y ≤ 200\n6y + 5y ≤ 200\n11y ≤ 200\ny ≤ 200/11 ≈ 18.18\n\nSince y must be a whole number, the maximum value for y is 18. Now, let's find the corresponding value for x:\n\nx = 2(18) = 36\n\nSo, the factory should produce 36 units of Product A and 18 units of Product B to maximize the profit. Now let's calculate the maximum profit:\n\nProfit = 40(36) + 60(18) = 1440 + 1080 = $2520"
