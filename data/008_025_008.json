    "message_2": "To show that the given system of linear equations has no solutions, we will try to manipulate the equations to find a contradiction.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference between the second and third equations:\n\n(3x - y + 4z) - (2x - y + 3z) = 9 - 7\nx + z = 2  (Equation 4)\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the first and fourth equations:\n\n(x + y + z) - (x + z) = 5 - 2\ny = 3\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the first equation:\n\nx + 3 + z = 5\nx + z = 2\n\nBut we already have x + z = 2 from Equation 4. This means that the first and fourth equations are essentially the same. Now, let's substitute the value of y back into the second equation:\n\n2x - 3 + 3z = 7\n2x + 3z = 10\n\nNow, let's multiply Equation 4 by 2:\n\n2(x + z) = 2(2)\n2x + 2z = 4\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the new equation and the modified second equation:\n\n(2x + 3z) - (2x + 2z) = 10 - 4\nz = 6\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into Equation 4:\n\nx + 6 = 2\nx = -4\n\nNow we have the values of x, y, and z:\n\nx = -4\ny = 3\nz = 6\n\nHowever, these values do not satisfy the third equation:\n\n3x - y + 4z = 9\n3(-4) - 3 + 4(6) = -12 - 3 + 24 = 9\n\nThis is a contradiction, as the values of x, y, and z do not satisfy all three equations simultaneously. Therefore, the given system of linear equations has no solutions."
