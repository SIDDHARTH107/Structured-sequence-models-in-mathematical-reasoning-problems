    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ of the given 1-form $\\omega = x^2 dy + yz dz$, we apply the following rules:\n\n1. Linearity: $d(\\alpha \\omega_1 + \\beta \\omega_2) = \\alpha d\\omega_1 + \\beta d\\omega_2$ for scalar functions $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and differential forms $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$.\n2. Product rule: $d(\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_2) = d\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_2 + (-1)^{p} \\omega_1 \\wedge d\\omega_2$, where $\\omega_1$ is a $p$-form and $\\omega_2$ is a $q$-form.\n3. Coordinate rule: $d(x^i) = dx^i$ for coordinate functions $x^i$.\n\nApplying these rules, we have:\n\n$d\\omega = d(x^2 dy + yz dz) = d(x^2 dy) + d(yz dz)$.\n\nNow, we apply the product rule to each term:\n\n$d(x^2 dy) = d(x^2) \\wedge dy + x^2 d(dy) = (2x dx) \\wedge dy = 2x dx \\wedge dy$,\n\nsince $d(dy) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$d(yz dz) = d(yz) \\wedge dz + yz d(dz) = (y dz + z dy) \\wedge dz = y dz \\wedge dz + z dy \\wedge dz = z dy \\wedge dz$,\n\nsince $d(dz) = 0$ and $dz \\wedge dz = 0$.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$d\\omega = 2x dx \\wedge dy + z dy \\wedge dz$.\n\nNow, we can see that $d\\omega \\neq 0$, since the coefficients of $dx \\wedge dy$ and $dy \\wedge dz$ are non-zero functions. Therefore, the 1-form $\\omega$ is not a closed form."
