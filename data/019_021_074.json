    "message_1": "A game is played by two players, Alice and Bob, simultaneously and in secret. Each player must choose a number between 1 and 5 (inclusive). If the two numbers sum up to an even number, Alice wins, and if the two numbers sum up to an odd number, Bob wins. If the two players choose the same number, the game is a draw. What is the probability that Alice wins this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that Alice wins, we need to determine the number of outcomes where the sum of the two numbers is even and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are 5 choices for Alice and 5 choices for Bob, so there are a total of 5 * 5 = 25 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's find the number of outcomes where the sum is even. We can do this by listing the possible combinations:\n\n1. Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 3\n2. Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 5\n3. Alice chooses 2, Bob chooses 4\n4. Alice chooses 3, Bob chooses 1\n5. Alice chooses 3, Bob chooses 5\n6. Alice chooses 4, Bob chooses 2\n7. Alice chooses 5, Bob chooses 1\n8. Alice chooses 5, Bob chooses 3\n\nThere are 8 outcomes where the sum is even, and Alice wins.\n\nSo, the probability that Alice wins is 8/25."
