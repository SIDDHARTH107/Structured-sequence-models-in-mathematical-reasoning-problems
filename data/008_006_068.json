For λ1 = 3:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([3 - 3, -1; 2, 2 - 3] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n([0, -1; 2, -1] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we have -x2 = 0, which means x2 = 0. From the second row, we have 2x1 - x2 = 2x1 = 0, which means x1 = 0. However, this would result in the zero vector, which is not an eigenvector. There seems to be a mistake in the matrix or the eigenvalue. Please check the matrix or the eigenvalue and try again.\n\n2.
