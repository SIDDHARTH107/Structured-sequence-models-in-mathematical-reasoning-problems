Alice chooses a secret integer a = 4 and computes A = g^a mod p. Bob chooses a secret integer b = 7 and computes B = g^b mod p. What is the shared secret key they will use for communication?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, we need to compute the following:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p\n\nGiven the values p = 17, g = 3, a = 4, and b = 7, let's compute the shared secret key:\n\n1. A = 3^4 mod 17 = 81 mod 17 = 13\n2. B = 3^7 mod 17 = 2187 mod 17 = 9\n3. K_A = 9^4 mod 17 = 6561 mod 17 = 1\n4. K_B = 13^7 mod 17 = 62748517 mod 17 = 1\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have computed the shared secret key as 1. Therefore, the shared secret key they will use for communication is 1."
