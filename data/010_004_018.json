Find out whether the following subsets are compact:\n1) [0,1/2)\n2) (1/2,1]\n3) [0,1/2] U (1/2,1)\n\n(Note: [a,b] represents the closed interval from a to b, including both a and b; (a,b) represents the open interval from a to b, not including either a or b; [a,b) represents the half-open interval from a to b, including a but not b.)",
    "message_2": "Recall that a subset A of a topological space X is compact if every open cover of A has a finite subcover. In the context of the real line with the usual topology, the Heine-Borel theorem states that a subset of the real line is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.\n\n1) [0,1/2)\nThis subset is bounded, as it is contained within the interval [0,1]. However, it is not closed, as the point 1/2 is a limit point of the set but is not included in the set. Therefore, [0,1/2) is not compact.\n\n2) (1/2,1]\nThis subset is also bounded, as it is contained within the interval [0,1]. However, it is not closed, as the point 1/2 is a limit point of the set but is not included in the set. Therefore, (1/2,1] is not compact.\n\n3) [0,1/2] U (1/2,1)\nThis subset is the union of a closed and bounded set ([0,1/2]) and an open and bounded set ((1/2,1)). However, the union of these two sets is not closed, as the point 1/2 is a limit point of the set but is not included in the set. Therefore, [0,1/2] U (1/2,1) is not compact."
