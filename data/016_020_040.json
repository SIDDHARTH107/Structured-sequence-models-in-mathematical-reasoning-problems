    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron is a fractal created by repeatedly removing smaller tetrahedra from the original tetrahedron. In each iteration, the volume removed is 1/4 of the remaining volume.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the volume is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\nAfter the second iteration, the volume is 3/4 - 3/16 = 9/16.\nAfter the third iteration, the volume is 9/16 - 9/64 = 27/64.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the volume is 27/64 - 27/256 = 81/256.\nAfter the fifth iteration, the volume is 81/256 - 81/1024 = 243/1024.\nAfter the sixth iteration, the volume is 243/1024 - 243/4096 = 729/4096.\n\nSo, the volume of the Sierpinski tetrahedron after six iterations is 729/4096."
