    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 7, we will use the power rule of integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\n∫(2x^3)dx = (2x^(3+1))/(3+1) = (1/2)x^4\n\n∫(5x^2)dx = (5x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (5/3)x^3\n\n∫(-4x)dx = (-4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = -2x^2\n\n∫(7)dx = 7x (since the antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x)\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration, C:\n\n∫(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 7)dx = (1/2)x^4 + (5/3)x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x + C"
