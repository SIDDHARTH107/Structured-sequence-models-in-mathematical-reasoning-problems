    "message_1": "A company is trying to optimize their production of two products, P1 and P2. The production of P1 requires 2 hours of machine time, 1 hour of assembly time, and yields a profit of \\$10. The production of P2 requires 1 hour of machine time, 3 hours of assembly time, and yields a profit of \\$15. However, due to time constraints, the company can only allocate a maximum of 15 hours of machine time and 18 hours of assembly time per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit, and what is the maximum profit it can earn per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of P1 produced and y be the number of units of P2 produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 15 (machine time constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 18 (assembly time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function, which is given by:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 15\ny ≤ -2x + 15\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 18\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 6\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0,0), (0,6), (3,5), and (7.5,0). We'll evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (0,0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0,6) = 10(0) + 15(6) = $90\n3. Profit at (3,5) = 10(3) + 15(5) = $105\n4. Profit at (7.5,0) = 10(7.5) + 15(0) = $75\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (3,5), where the company should produce 3 units of P1 and 5 units of P2. The maximum profit per day is $105."
