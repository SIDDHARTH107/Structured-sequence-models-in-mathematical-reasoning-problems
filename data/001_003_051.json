    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations so that we can eliminate one of the variables. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\n(2)(2x + 3y) = (2)(10)\n4x + 6y = 20\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 20\n4x - 5y = -6\n\nNext, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 20 - (-6)\n4x + 6y - 4x + 5y = 26\n11y = 26\n\nNow, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 11:\n\ny = 26 / 11\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 10\n2x + 3(26/11) = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 11 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n11(2x) + 11(3)(26/11) = 10(11)\n22x + 78 = 110\n\nNow, subtract 78 from both sides:\n\n22x = 32\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 22 to solve for x:\n\nx = 32 / 22\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 16/11\ny = 26/11"
