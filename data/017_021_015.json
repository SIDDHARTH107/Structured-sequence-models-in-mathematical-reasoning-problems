    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the order of G and satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 2^4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nSince G has exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, we have n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1. Let P be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, |P| = 2^4 = 16 and |Q| = 3.\n\nSince P and Q are the unique Sylow subgroups of their respective orders, they are both normal in G (by Sylow's Theorem). Therefore, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G, and |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have coprime orders, their intersection is trivial (i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}), so |PQ| = 16 * 3 = 48, which means PQ = G.\n\nNow, we consider the structure of P. Since P is a group of order 16, it can be either cyclic (C16), direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 (C4 × C4), or a generalized quaternion group (Q16), or a dihedral group (D8), or a semidirect product of C8 and C2. However, since G has only one Sylow 2-subgroup, P must be a normal subgroup of G. This eliminates the possibility of P being a semidirect product of C8 and C2, as it would have more than one Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nThus, we have the following possibilities for the structure of G:\n\n1. G = C16 × C3: In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 48, so G is isomorphic to C48.\n2. G = (C4 × C4) × C3: In this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4.\n3. G = Q16 × C3: In this case, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group Q16 × C3. However, Q16 × C3 is not a valid option because Q16 is not a direct product of two smaller groups, and the only groups of order 48 that can be expressed as a direct product are C48, A4 × C4, and D8 × C3.\n4. G = D8 × C3: In this case, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group D8 × C3.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the three possible groups: cyclic group C48, alternating group A4 × C4, or non-abelian group D8 × C3."
