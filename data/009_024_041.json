    "message_1": "Consider a steady, two-dimensional flow of water over a flat plate with length 1 m and width 0.1 m. The free-stream velocity is 10 m/s and the fluid has a density of 1000 kg/m^3 and a dynamic viscosity of 0.001 Pa*s. Using Navier-Stokes equations, determine the shear stress at the surface of the plate if the velocity profile near the surface is given by u(y) = 5/6*(u_max)*y/h * (h-y), where u_max is the maximum velocity in the flow and h is the height of the flow.",
    "message_2": "To determine the shear stress at the surface of the plate, we first need to find the velocity gradient at the surface (y=0). The velocity profile is given by:\n\nu(y) = 5/6 * (u_max) * y/h * (h-y)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of u(y) with respect to y:\n\ndu/dy = d(5/6 * (u_max) * y/h * (h-y))/dy\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\ndu/dy = 5/6 * (u_max) * (1/h * (h-y) - y/h)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the velocity gradient at the surface of the plate, which is when y = 0:\n\ndu/dy(y=0) = 5/6 * (u_max) * (1/h * (h-0) - 0/h)\ndu/dy(y=0) = 5/6 * (u_max) * (1/h * h)\ndu/dy(y=0) = 5/6 * (u_max)\n\nNow that we have the velocity gradient at the surface, we can find the shear stress using the following formula:\n\nτ = μ * (du/dy)\n\nWhere τ is the shear stress, μ is the dynamic viscosity, and du/dy is the velocity gradient. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nτ = 0.001 Pa*s * (5/6 * (u_max))\n\nSince the free-stream velocity is 10 m/s, we can assume that the maximum velocity (u_max) is close to this value. Therefore:\n\nτ = 0.001 Pa*s * (5/6 * 10 m/s)\nτ = 0.001 Pa*s * (50/6 m/s)\nτ = 0.008333 Pa\n\nSo, the shear stress at the surface of the plate is approximately 0.008333 Pa."
