    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and the parallel sides are 12 cm and 18 cm respectively. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two non-parallel sides. Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of these sides. Since the height is perpendicular to the parallel sides, we can form two right triangles by drawing the height from one vertex of the trapezium to the opposite parallel side.\n\nLet's consider the right triangle formed with the height and side a. The base of this triangle is the difference between the lengths of the parallel sides, which is (18 - 12) cm = 6 cm. The height is 8 cm. Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 = 6^2 + 8^2\na^2 = 36 + 64\na^2 = 100\na = 10 cm\n\nNow let's consider the right triangle formed with the height and side b. The base of this triangle is the same as the shorter parallel side, which is 12 cm. The height is 8 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem again:\n\nb^2 = 12^2 + 8^2\nb^2 = 144 + 64\nb^2 = 208\nb = √208 ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all four sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 18 cm + 10 cm + 14.42 cm ≈ 54.42 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 54.42 cm."
