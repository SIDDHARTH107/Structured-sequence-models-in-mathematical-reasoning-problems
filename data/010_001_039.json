Prove that the closure $\\overline{A}$ is also connected.\n\nQuestion for the student to solve: Let $A = \\left\\{\\frac{1}{n} \\mid n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\right\\}$ be a subset of the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. Show that $A$ and its closure $\\overline{A}$ have the same number of connected components.",
    "message_2": "Proof that the closure $\\overline{A}$ is connected:\n\nAssume for contradiction that $\\overline{A}$ is not connected. Then there exist two non-empty open sets $U$ and $V$ in $X$ such that $\\overline{A} \\subset U \\cup V$, $U \\cap \\overline{A} \\neq \\emptyset$, $V \\cap \\overline{A} \\neq \\emptyset$, and $(U \\cap \\overline{A}) \\cap (V \\cap \\overline{A}) = \\emptyset$. \n\nNow, consider the sets $U \\cap A$ and $V \\cap A$. These sets are non-empty since $U \\cap \\overline{A} \\neq \\emptyset$ and $V \\cap \\overline{A} \\neq \\emptyset$. Moreover, $(U \\cap A) \\cap (V \\cap A) = \\emptyset$. Since $A \\subset U \\cup V$, we have $A = (U \\cap A) \\cup (V \\cap A)$. This contradicts the assumption that $A$ is connected. Therefore, the closure $\\overline{A}$ must be connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $A = \\left\\{\\frac{1}{n} \\mid n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\right\\}$ as a subset of the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. We will show that $A$ and its closure $\\overline{A}$ have the same number of connected components.\n\nThe set $A$ consists of isolated points, and each point forms a connected component. Thus, $A$ has countably infinitely many connected components.\n\nThe closure of $A$ is given by $\\overline{A} = A \\cup \\{0\\}$. To show that $\\overline{A}$ has the same number of connected components as $A$, we need to show that adding the point $0$ does not change the number of connected components.\n\nConsider any connected component $C$ of $A$. If $0 \\notin C$, then $C$ is also a connected component of $\\overline{A}$. If $0 \\in C$, then $C \\cup \\{0\\}$ is a connected component of $\\overline{A}$. In either case, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the connected components of $A$ and $\\overline{A}$.\n\nTherefore, $A$ and its closure $\\overline{A}$ have the same number of connected components, which is countably infinite."
