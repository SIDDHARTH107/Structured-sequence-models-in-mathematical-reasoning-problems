    "message_1": "Consider a symplectic manifold $(M, \\omega)$ with two closed hypersurfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$ that are symplectic submanifolds. Suppose that $\\dim S_1=2$, $\\dim S_2 =4$ and that $S_1$ and $S_2$ intersect transversely at a point $p$. If $\\int_{S_1} \\omega = 2$ and $\\int_{S_2} \\omega = 5$, compute the degree of the normal bundle to $S_2$ at $p$.",
    "message_2": "Let $N_{S_2}$ denote the normal bundle to $S_2$ at $p$. Since $S_1$ and $S_2$ intersect transversely at $p$, we have that $T_pM = T_pS_1 \\oplus T_pS_2$. Moreover, since $S_1$ is a symplectic submanifold, we have that $\\omega|_{S_1}$ is non-degenerate. \n\nNow, let $v \\in T_pS_1$ be a non-zero vector. Since $\\omega|_{S_1}$ is non-degenerate, there exists a vector $w \\in T_pS_1$ such that $\\omega(v, w) \\neq 0$. We can extend $v$ and $w$ to a local symplectic basis $\\{v, w, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ of $T_pM$. Since $S_2$ is also a symplectic submanifold, we have that $\\omega|_{S_2}$ is non-degenerate as well. Therefore, there exists a local symplectic basis $\\{f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4\\}$ of $T_pS_2$.\n\nNow, let $e^*_1, e^*_2, e^*_3, e^*_4$ be the dual basis of $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$, and let $f^*_1, f^*_2, f^*_3, f^*_4$ be the dual basis of $\\{f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4\\}$. Then, we have that $\\omega = v \\wedge w + e^*_1 \\wedge e^*_2 + e^*_3 \\wedge e^*_4 = f^*_1 \\wedge f^*_2 + f^*_3 \\wedge f^*_4$.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of the normal bundle to $S_2$ at $p$. Since $S_1$ and $S_2$ intersect transversely at $p$, we have that $N_{S_2} \\cong T_pS_1$. Therefore, the degree of the normal bundle to $S_2$ at $p$ is given by the integral of the symplectic form over $S_1$, which is $\\int_{S_1} \\omega = 2$."
