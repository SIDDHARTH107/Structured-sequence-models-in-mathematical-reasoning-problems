If Alice chooses her secret number as 6 and Bob chooses his secret number as 9, what is the shared secret key that they will use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key (A) by raising the primitive root (3) to the power of her secret number (6) modulo the prime number (13): A = (3^6) % 13\n2. Bob computes his public key (B) by raising the primitive root (3) to the power of his secret number (9) modulo the prime number (13): B = (3^9) % 13\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key (S) by raising Bob's public key (B) to the power of her secret number (6) modulo the prime number (13): S = (B^6) % 13\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key (S) by raising Alice's public key (A) to the power of his secret number (9) modulo the prime number (13): S = (A^9) % 13\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n1. A = (3^6) % 13 = 729 % 13 = 3\n2. B = (3^9) % 13 = 19683 % 13 = 9\n3. S = (B^6) % 13 = (9^6) % 13 = 531441 % 13 = 3\n4. S = (A^9) % 13 = (3^9) % 13 = 19683 % 13 = 3\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their communication is 3."
