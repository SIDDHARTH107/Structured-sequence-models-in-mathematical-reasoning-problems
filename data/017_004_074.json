    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 25, we have that |G| = 5^2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must divide the index [G : P], where P is a 5-Sylow subgroup of G. In this case, [G : P] = |G|/|P| = 25/5 = 5. Thus, n_5 must divide 5. The only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5. However, by the Sylow theorems, n_5 must also be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Therefore, n_5 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one 5-Sylow subgroup P in G, it must be normal in G. Now, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩, and the order of g is 25. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_25.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then there is no element of order 25 in G. Since P is a normal 5-Sylow subgroup of G with order 5, P is isomorphic to Z_5. Let P = ⟨a⟩, where a has order 5. Since |G| = 25 and |P| = 5, there must exist an element b in G such that b is not in P and has order 5. Let Q = ⟨b⟩. Then, Q is a cyclic subgroup of order 5.\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. To do this, we need to show that G = PQ and P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nFirst, we show that G = PQ. Since |P| = 5 and |Q| = 5, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|. If we can show that P ∩ Q = {e}, then |PQ| = 25, which implies G = PQ. To show that P ∩ Q = {e}, we note that P and Q are both cyclic groups of prime order 5. The only subgroup of P and Q with order 1 is the trivial subgroup {e}. Therefore, P ∩ Q = {e}.\n\nNow, we have shown that G = PQ and P ∩ Q = {e}. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are both cyclic groups of order 5. In other words, G is isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_25) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 (isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_5)."
