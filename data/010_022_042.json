    "message_2": "Let's denote the center of the sphere as O and the center of the circle formed by the intersection as C. The radius of the sphere is given as 5 cm, and the distance between the center of the sphere and the plane is 4 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the circle formed by the intersection.\n\nLet r be the radius of the circle. Then, we have a right triangle with OC = 4 cm, OC' = 5 cm (C' is the orthogonal projection of C on the plane containing O), and CC' = r. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nOC'^2 = OC^2 + CC'^2\n5^2 = 4^2 + r^2\n25 = 16 + r^2\nr^2 = 9\nr = 3 cm\n\nNow, let's denote the coordinates of the center of the sphere O as (0, 0, 0). Since the plane is 4 cm away from the center, we can assume that the equation of the plane is given by z = 4 (without loss of generality).\n\nThe equation of a circle in a plane with center (h, k) and radius r is given by:\n\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n\nSince the center of the circle C lies on the plane z = 4, its coordinates can be represented as (h, k, 4). Therefore, the equation of the circle formed by the intersection of the sphere and the plane is:\n\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 3^2\n\nThis is the equation of the circle in the plane z = 4. To find the specific values of h and k, we would need more information about the orientation of the plane relative to the sphere."
