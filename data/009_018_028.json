Suppose the initial population density is $y(0)=0.1$ and the carrying capacity coefficient is $k=2.5$. Find the equilibrium points and classify them as stable, unstable or semistable. Also, graph the solution for the given initial condition.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium points, we set $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$ and solve for $y$:\n\n$0 = k y(1-y)$\n\nThis equation has two solutions: $y = 0$ and $y = 1$. These are the equilibrium points.\n\nTo classify the equilibrium points as stable, unstable, or semistable, we analyze the stability by looking at the sign of $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$ at the equilibrium points.\n\nFirst, we find the second derivative of $y$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}(k y(1-y)) = k(1-2y)\\frac{dy}{dt}$\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the equilibrium points:\n\n1. At $y = 0$:\n\n$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = k(1-2(0))\\frac{dy}{dt} = k\\frac{dy}{dt}$\n\nSince $k > 0$, the second derivative is positive when $\\frac{dy}{dt} > 0$ and negative when $\\frac{dy}{dt} < 0$. Thus, the equilibrium point $y = 0$ is unstable.\n\n2. At $y = 1$:\n\n$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = k(1-2(1))\\frac{dy}{dt} = -k\\frac{dy}{dt}$\n\nSince $k > 0$, the second derivative is negative when $\\frac{dy}{dt} > 0$ and positive when $\\frac{dy}{dt} < 0$. Thus, the equilibrium point $y = 1$ is stable.\n\nNow, we graph the solution for the given initial condition $y(0) = 0.1$.\n\nTo do this, we first need to find the general solution to the logistic equation. We can rewrite the logistic equation as a separable differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{y(1-y)} = k dt$\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n$\\int \\frac{dy}{y(1-y)} = \\int k dt$\n\n$\\ln\\left|\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right| = kt + C$\n\nNow, we solve for $y$:\n\n$\\frac{y}{1-y} = e^{kt + C}$\n\n$y = (1-y)e^{kt + C}$\n\n$y = e^{kt + C} - ye^{kt + C}$\n\n$y(1 + e^{kt + C}) = e^{kt + C}$\n\n$y = \\frac{e^{kt + C}}{1 + e^{kt + C}}$\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $y(0) = 0.1$ to find the constant $C$:\n\n$0.1 = \\frac{e^{0 + C}}{1 + e^{0 + C}}$\n\n$0.1 = \\frac{e^C}{1 + e^C}$\n\n$0.1 + 0.1e^C = e^C$\n\n$0.1 = e^C(1 - 0.1)$\n\n$C = \\ln(0.1)$\n\nSo, the solution to the logistic equation with the given initial condition is:\n\n$y(t) = \\frac{e^{2.5t + \\ln(0.1)}}{1 + e^{2.5t + \\ln(0.1)}}$\n\nNow, we can graph this solution. The graph will show that the population density $y(t)$ increases from the initial condition $y(0) = 0.1$ and approaches the stable equilibrium point $y = 1$ as $t$ increases. The unstable equilibrium point $y = 0$ is not reached by the solution."
