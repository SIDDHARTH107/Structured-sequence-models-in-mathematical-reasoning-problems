    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, which is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)\n\nwhere V(x, y) = 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + a * (x^2 * y - 1/3 * y^3) + b * (x^4 + y^4).\n\nFor the given parameter values a = 1, b = 1, and energy value E = 0.5, we have:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2 * y - 1/3 * y^3 + x^4 + y^4.\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to numerically integrate the equations of motion derived from the Hamiltonian and compute the Lyapunov exponent from the divergence of nearby trajectories. This is a complex task that requires specialized numerical methods and software.\n\nUnfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform numerical simulations or compute numerical values for the Lyapunov exponent. I recommend using specialized software like Mathematica or MATLAB to perform the numerical integration and computation of the Lyapunov exponent for the given Henon-Heiles system."
