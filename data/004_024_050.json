    "message_2": "To find dy/dx, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nThe given equation is: 4y^4 + x^2 y^2 = 5\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\nd/dx (4y^4) + d/dx (x^2 y^2) = d/dx (5)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n4(4y^3) (dy/dx) + (2xy^2 + x^2(2y) (dy/dx)) = 0\n\nNow, we'll plug in the given values x = 1 and y = 1/2:\n\n4(4(1/2)^3) (dy/dx) + (2(1)(1/2)^2 + (1)^2(2(1/2)) (dy/dx)) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n4(1/2) (dy/dx) + (1/2 + 1 (dy/dx)) = 0\n\n2(dy/dx) + 1/2 + dy/dx = 0\n\nCombining the terms with dy/dx:\n\n3(dy/dx) = -1/2\n\nNow, we'll solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = -1/6\n\nSo, when x = 1 and y = 1/2, the derivative dy/dx is -1/6."
