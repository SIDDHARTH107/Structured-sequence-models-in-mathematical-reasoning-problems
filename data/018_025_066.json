    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∩ B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {5, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B ∆ A. Note that the symmetric difference is commutative, so B ∆ A = A ∆ B:\n\nB ∆ A = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find (B ∆ A) ∩ A:\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ A = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1, 2}\n\nWe can see that (A ∆ B) ∩ B = {5, 6} and (B ∆ A) ∩ A = {1, 2}. Since these two sets are not equal, this demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
