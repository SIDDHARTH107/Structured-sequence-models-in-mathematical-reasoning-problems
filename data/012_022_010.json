    "message_2": "To find the Ramsey number R(3, 4), we will use the definition of Ramsey numbers and the Ramsey's theorem. \n\nRamsey's theorem states that for any given positive integers m and n, there exists a smallest positive integer R(m, n) such that any graph with R(m, n) vertices will contain either a clique of size m or an independent set of size n.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the smallest number of vertices R(3, 4) such that either the graph contains a triangular cycle (a clique of size 3) or its complement contains a complete 4-clique (an independent set of size 4).\n\nWe will use the recursive formula for Ramsey numbers:\n\nR(m, n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1) for m, n > 2\n\nFirst, we need to find the base cases R(2, n) and R(m, 2):\n\nR(2, n) = n for all n, since a graph with n vertices will always contain an edge (a clique of size 2) or an independent set of size n.\n\nNow we can use the recursive formula to find R(3, 4):\n\nR(3, 4) = R(2, 4) + R(3, 3)\n\nR(2, 4) = 4 (from the base case)\n\nR(3, 3) = R(2, 3) + R(3, 2) = 3 + 3 = 6 (using the base cases)\n\nSo, R(3, 4) = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTherefore, the Ramsey number R(3, 4) is 10, which means that any graph with 10 vertices will contain either a triangular cycle or its complement will contain a complete 4-clique."
