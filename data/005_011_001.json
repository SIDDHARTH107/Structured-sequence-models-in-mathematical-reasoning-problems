    "message_1": "An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of different types of fertilizer on the growth of tomato plants. Two types of fertilizer (Fert A and Fert B) were applied to two groups of tomato plants. Group 1 received Fert A and Group 2 received Fert B. Each group contained 20 tomato plants. After 4 weeks, the height of each tomato plant was measured. Calculate the mean height of tomato plants in each group and compare them to determine which fertilizer is more effective for growth.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mean height of tomato plants in each group, we need the height measurements of all the plants in each group. Please provide the height measurements for the tomato plants in Group 1 and Group 2."
