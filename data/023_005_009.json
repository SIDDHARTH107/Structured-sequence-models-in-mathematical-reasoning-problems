    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-2|t|), we first need to split the function into two parts based on the absolute value of t:\n\nf(t) = e^(-2t) for t ≥ 0\nf(t) = e^(2t) for t < 0\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t) using the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-iωt) dt] from 0 to ∞ + ∫[e^(2t) * e^(-iωt) dt] from -∞ to 0\n\nLet's evaluate the integrals separately:\n\nFor the first integral, we have:\n\n∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-iωt) dt] from 0 to ∞ = ∫[e^(-2t - iωt) dt] from 0 to ∞\n\nLet's substitute u = -2t - iωt:\n\ndu/dt = -2 - iω\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n(-1/2 - iω/2) * ∫[e^u du] from 0 to ∞\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n(-1/2 - iω/2) * [(-1) * e^u] from 0 to ∞ = (-1/2 - iω/2) * (0 - (-1)) = 1/2 + iω/2\n\nFor the second integral, we have:\n\n∫[e^(2t) * e^(-iωt) dt] from -∞ to 0 = ∫[e^(2t - iωt) dt] from -∞ to 0\n\nLet's substitute v = 2t - iωt:\n\ndv/dt = 2 - iω\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n(1/2 - iω/2) * ∫[e^v dv] from -∞ to 0\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n(1/2 - iω/2) * [e^v] from -∞ to 0 = (1/2 - iω/2) * (1 - 0) = 1/2 - iω/2\n\nNow, we can add the two parts of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2 + iω/2) + (1/2 - iω/2) = 1\n\nNow that we have the Fourier transform of f(t), we can use it to solve the differential equation y'' + 4y = e^(-2|t|).\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n(ω^2 + 4)Y(ω) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = 1 / (ω^2 + 4)\n\nFinally, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get the solution y(t):\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) * ∫[1 / (ω^2 + 4) * e^(iωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral represents the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) and is the solution to the given differential equation. However, solving this integral analytically is quite complex and typically requires advanced techniques such as contour integration and residue theorem from complex analysis."
