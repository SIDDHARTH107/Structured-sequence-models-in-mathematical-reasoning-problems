    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by starting with a set of mutually tangent circles and repeatedly filling in the spaces between them with new tangent circles. In this case, we have four mutually tangent circles with curvatures of 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. To find the radius of each circle, we need to use the formula for curvature, which is k = 1/r. Therefore, the radius of each circle can be found by taking the reciprocal of its curvature:\n\n- Circle 1: r1 = 1/3\n- Circle 2: r2 = 1/4\n- Circle 3: r3 = 1/5\n- Circle 4: r4 = 1/6\n\nNow, we can find the area of each circle:\n\n- Circle 1: A1 = π(1/3)^2 = π/9\n- Circle 2: A2 = π(1/4)^2 = π/16\n- Circle 3: A3 = π(1/5)^2 = π/25\n- Circle 4: A4 = π(1/6)^2 = π/36\n\nTo find the sum of their areas, we simply add the areas of all four circles:\n\nA_total = A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 = (π/9) + (π/16) + (π/25) + (π/36)\n\nTo add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9, 16, 25, and 36 is 3600. So, we rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 3600:\n\nA_total = (400π/3600) + (225π/3600) + (144π/3600) + (100π/3600)\n\nNow, we can add the numerators:\n\nA_total = (400π + 225π + 144π + 100π) / 3600 = (869π) / 3600\n\nSo, the sum of the areas of the four circles is (869π) / 3600."
