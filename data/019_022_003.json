The student estimates that if they take a gap year, they have a 60% chance of getting a job that pays USD 20,000/year, a 30% chance of getting a job that pays USD 10,000/year, and a 10% chance of not getting a job. If they start university right away, they estimate a 90% chance of getting a job that pays USD 30,000/year, and a 10% chance of not getting a job. Which option has a higher expected value?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value for each option, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by its respective value and then sum them up.\n\nFor the gap year option:\nExpected value = (0.6 * $20,000) + (0.3 * $10,000) + (0.1 * $0)\nExpected value = ($12,000) + ($3,000) + ($0)\nExpected value = $15,000\n\nFor starting university right away:\nExpected value = (0.9 * $30,000) + (0.1 * $0)\nExpected value = ($27,000) + ($0)\nExpected value = $27,000\n\nComparing the expected values, starting university right away has a higher expected value of $27,000 compared to taking a gap year with an expected value of $15,000."
