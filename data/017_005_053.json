    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides 27, and\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P of G, which is normal in G (by Sylow's second theorem). Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, we have that P is a group of order 9. By the classification of groups of order p^2, where p is prime, we know that P is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_9) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 (isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3).\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since |G/P| = |G|/|P| = 27/9 = 3, G/P is a cyclic group of order 3. By the correspondence theorem, there exists a subgroup H of G such that H/P is isomorphic to G/P. Since |H/P| = 3, we have |H| = 9. Now, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: P is isomorphic to Z_9.\nIn this case, G is generated by an element of order 9 and an element of order 3. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nCase 2: P is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3.\nIn this case, G is generated by two elements of order 3 and an element of order 9. Since the orders of these elements are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
