Suppose that D generates an extremal ray, and let C be a curve in that ray with negative self-intersection. Show that the Mori dream space associated with the Zariski decomposition of D is birational to a blow-up of X along C. Given X = P³ and D = 3H - E, where H is the hyperplane class and E is an effective divisor linearly equivalent to 2H, compute the algebraic dimension of the Mori dream space associated to D.",
    "message_2": "To show that the Mori dream space associated with the Zariski decomposition of D is birational to a blow-up of X along C, we will use the Cone Theorem and the contraction theorem.\n\nBy the Cone Theorem, the Mori cone of curves NE(X) is generated by the classes of curves contracted by extremal contractions. Since D generates an extremal ray, there exists an extremal contraction φ: X → Y with the property that φ(C) is a point, and the image of the extremal ray is a curve in Y.\n\nNow, let E' be the strict transform of E under the extremal contraction φ. Then, we have φ*(3H - E) = 3φ*(H) - E' on Y. Since φ*(H) is a nef divisor on Y, we can apply the Zariski decomposition on Y to the divisor 3φ*(H) - E'. Let P_Y and N_Y be the nef part and the negative part of the Zariski decomposition of 3φ*(H) - E' on Y, respectively.\n\nBy the contraction theorem, there exists a birational morphism ψ: Y' → Y such that Y' is the blow-up of Y along a curve C' with exceptional divisor F, and ψ*(P_Y) = P_Y' + aF for some positive integer a, where P_Y' is the strict transform of P_Y under ψ.\n\nNow, consider the composition ψ ∘ φ: X → Y'. This is a birational morphism, and we have (ψ ∘ φ)*(D) = ψ*(3φ*(H) - E') = ψ*(P_Y + N_Y) = P_Y' + aF + ψ*(N_Y). Since P_Y' + aF is a nef divisor on Y', the Mori dream space associated with the Zariski decomposition of D is birational to the blow-up of X along C.\n\nNow, let's compute the algebraic dimension of the Mori dream space associated to D. Given X = P³ and D = 3H - E, where H is the hyperplane class and E is an effective divisor linearly equivalent to 2H, we have:\n\nD = 3H - 2H = H\n\nSince D is linearly equivalent to H, the Mori dream space associated to D is just the projective space P³ itself. Therefore, the algebraic dimension of the Mori dream space associated to D is 3."
