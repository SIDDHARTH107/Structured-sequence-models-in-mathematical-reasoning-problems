    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components in the graph, we can use the formula:\n\nnumber of connected components = number of vertices - number of edges + number of cycles\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of cycles in the graph. Since the graph has 6 vertices, the maximum number of edges it can have without forming a cycle is 5 (forming a tree). However, the graph has 9 edges, which means there are 9 - 5 = 4 additional edges that form cycles.\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nnumber of connected components = 6 - 9 + 4 = 1\n\nSo, the graph has 1 connected component."
