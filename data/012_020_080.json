    "message_2": "To determine the automorphism group of G, we first need to understand the structure of the graph G with 5 vertices and 7 edges. Since a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5) has 10 edges, our graph G is not complete. However, it must be connected, as a disconnected graph with 5 vertices can have at most 6 edges.\n\nLet's consider the possible structures of G:\n\n1. G has a vertex of degree 4: In this case, the graph G has a central vertex connected to all other vertices. The remaining 3 edges must form a connected subgraph among the other 4 vertices. The possible subgraphs are a triangle with an additional edge or a path of length 3. In both cases, the automorphism group of G is isomorphic to the symmetric group S4, which has 24 elements.\n\n2. G has a vertex of degree 3: In this case, the graph G has a central vertex connected to three other vertices. The remaining 4 edges must form a connected subgraph among the other 3 vertices and the one vertex not connected to the central vertex. The only possibility is a cycle of length 4. In this case, the automorphism group of G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, which has 8 elements.\n\n3. G has all vertices of degree 2: In this case, the graph G must be a cycle of length 5. The automorphism group of G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, which has 10 elements.\n\nTo determine which of these cases is the correct structure for G, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. Let d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5 be the degrees of the vertices in G.\n\nCase 1: d1 = 4, and the sum of the other degrees is 10. This is possible, as the Handshaking Lemma holds (4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10).\n\nCase 2: d1 = 3, and the sum of the other degrees is 11. This is not possible, as the Handshaking Lemma does not hold (3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 â‰  14).\n\nCase 3: All vertices have degree 2, and the sum of the degrees is 10. This is possible, as the Handshaking Lemma holds (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10).\n\nThus, the possible structures for G are cases 1 and 3. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is either isomorphic to the symmetric group S4 with 24 elements or the dihedral group D5 with 10 elements."
