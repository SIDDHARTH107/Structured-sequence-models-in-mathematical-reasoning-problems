    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor the given function, we can find the coefficients a_n and b_n using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1 / 2π) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x) dx] from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / 2π) * [∫(x dx) from 0 to π + ∫(2π - x dx) from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1 / 2π) * [(π^2 / 2) + (π^2 - π^2 / 2)] = (1 / 2π) * π^2 = π / 2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [∫(x * cos(n * x) dx) from 0 to π + ∫((2π - x) * cos(n * x) dx) from π to 2π]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [(x * sin(n * x) / n) from 0 to π - (1 / n) * ∫(sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π + (x * sin(n * x) / n) from π to 2π - (1 / n) * ∫(sin(n * x) dx) from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [(π * sin(n * π) / n) - (1 / n^2) * (cos(n * π) - 1) + (2π * sin(n * 2π) / n) - (π * sin(n * π) / n) - (1 / n^2) * (cos(n * 2π) - cos(n * π))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 and sin(n * 2π) = 0 for all integer values of n, we get:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [-(1 / n^2) * (cos(n * π) - 1) - (1 / n^2) * (1 - cos(n * π))] = -(2 / n^2) * (1 - cos(n * π))\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π + ∫((2π - x) * sin(n * x) dx) from π to 2π]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-x * cos(n * x) / n) from 0 to π + (1 / n) * ∫(cos(n * x) dx) from 0 to π + (-x * cos(n * x) / n) from π to 2π + (1 / n) * ∫(cos(n * x) dx) from π to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-π * cos(n * π) / n) + (1 / n^2) * (sin(n * π) - 0) + (π * cos(n * π) / n) + (1 / n^2) * (sin(n * 2π) - sin(n * π))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 and sin(n * 2π) = 0 for all integer values of n, we get:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the given function:\n\nf(x) = π / 2 - Σ[(2 / n^2) * (1 - cos(n * π)) * cos(n * x)]\n\nThe coefficient of the fourth harmonic corresponds to n = 4:\n\na_4 = -(2 / 4^2) * (1 - cos(4 * π)) = -(2 / 16) * (1 - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the coefficient of the fourth harmonic is 0."
