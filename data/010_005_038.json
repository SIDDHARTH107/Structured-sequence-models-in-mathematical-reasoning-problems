    "message_2": "If X is a connected topological space, it cannot have more than one path component. A connected space is a space that cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open sets. A path-connected space is a space where any two points can be connected by a continuous path.\n\nThe given information is contradictory, as a connected topological space cannot have exactly 3 path components. Therefore, the problem cannot be solved with the given information."
