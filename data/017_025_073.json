    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 120 cannot be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 10 and 12, we will use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 120. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow Theorems, G has Sylow p-subgroups of order 2^3, 3, and 5, denoted by P_8, P_3, and P_5, respectively.\n\nNow, let H be the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 10 and 12, i.e., H = C_10 x C_12. The orders of these cyclic groups are 10 = 2 * 5 and 12 = 2^2 * 3. Thus, H has Sylow p-subgroups of order 2^2, 3, and 5, denoted by Q_4, Q_3, and Q_5, respectively.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to H, then there must be a bijection between the Sylow p-subgroups of G and H. However, this is not possible because the orders of the Sylow 2-subgroups in G and H are different (8 and 4, respectively). Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to H.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 120 cannot be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 10 and 12."
