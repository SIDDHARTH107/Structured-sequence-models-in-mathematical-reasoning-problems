    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function, we first need to find its derivative and then set it equal to zero to solve for x.\n\nThe function is f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2.\n\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of the function is:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0. To do this, we can factor out the common term 4x:\n\nf'(x) = 4x(x^2 - 3x + 3)\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation 4x(x^2 - 3x + 3) = 0 for x.\n\nThere are two factors: 4x and (x^2 - 3x + 3). Setting each factor to zero, we get:\n\n4x = 0 => x = 0\n\nx^2 - 3x + 3 = 0\n\nThe quadratic equation (x^2 - 3x + 3) does not factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -3, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (3 ± √(9 - 12)) / 2\nx = (3 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x in the quadratic equation.\n\nSo, the only critical point of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 is x = 0."
