    "message_2": "To find the number of lines contained in a smooth cubic surface X in P^3, we can use the classical result from algebraic geometry known as the 27 lines theorem.\n\nThe 27 lines theorem states that a smooth cubic surface in P^3 contains exactly 27 lines.\n\nSo, the number of lines contained in X is 27."
