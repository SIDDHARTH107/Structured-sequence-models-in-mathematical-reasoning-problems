    "message_2": "First, let's recall some facts about groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a subgroup of order p^n in G, and the number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo p. In our case, since the order of G is 27 = 3^3, we have p = 3 and n = 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the maximum order of any element in G is 27. Since a has maximum order, the order of a is 27. By definition, a cyclic group of order 27 is generated by an element of order 27. Therefore, G is generated by a and is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the maximum order of any element in G is less than 27. Since G is a group of order 27, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a subgroup H of order 9 (3^2) in G. Let b be an element in G that has maximum order in H. Since the maximum order of any element in G is less than 27, the order of b must be 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of H. Since H has order 9, it must be isomorphic to either C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). However, since the order of b is 9, H must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nSince H is a normal subgroup of G (as it is the unique subgroup of order 9), we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 27/9 = 3, which means G/H is isomorphic to C3.\n\nNow, we have the following short exact sequence:\n\n1 → H → G → G/H → 1\n\nSince H is isomorphic to C9 and G/H is isomorphic to C3, we know that G is a semi-direct product of H and G/H. Since G/H is isomorphic to C3, there are two possible semi-direct products: the direct product (C9 × C3) and a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nHowever, we know that G is not isomorphic to the direct product C9 × C3, as this would imply that the maximum order of any element in G is 9, which contradicts our assumption that the maximum order of any element in G is less than 27. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
