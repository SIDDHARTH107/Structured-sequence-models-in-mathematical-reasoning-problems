They collect data on 20 individuals and record their height (in inches) and weight (in pounds). The data is shown in the table below. \n\n|Person | Height | Weight |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n|  1    |   68     |   165   |\n|  2    |   72     |   195   |\n|  3    |   70     |   183   |\n|  4    |   60     |   132   |\n|  5    |   64     |   139   |\n|  6    |   68     |   174   |\n|  7    |   62     |   131   |\n|  8    |   77     |   220   |\n|  9    |   75     |   200   |\n|  10  |   68     |   175   |\n|  11  |   70     |   170   |\n|  12  |   61     |   133   |\n|  13  |   65     |   145   |\n|  14  |   62     |   141   |\n|  15  |   69     |   176   |\n|  16  |   73     |   190   |\n|  17  |   71     |   185   |\n|  18  |   66     |   160   |\n|  19  |   68     |   175   |\n|  20  |   72     |   210   |\n\nThe math student would like to use multivariate analysis to determine if there is a relationship between height and weight in this group. \n\nWhat is the covariance between the height and weight of the individuals in this group?",
    "message_2": "To find the covariance between height and weight, we first need to find the mean of height and weight.\n\nMean of height = (68 + 72 + 70 + 60 + 64 + 68 + 62 + 77 + 75 + 68 + 70 + 61 + 65 + 62 + 69 + 73 + 71 + 66 + 68 + 72) / 20 = 1366 / 20 = 68.3 inches\n\nMean of weight = (165 + 195 + 183 + 132 + 139 + 174 + 131 + 220 + 200 + 175 + 170 + 133 + 145 + 141 + 176 + 190 + 185 + 160 + 175 + 210) / 20 = 3299 / 20 = 164.95 pounds\n\nNow, we calculate the covariance using the formula:\n\nCovariance = Σ[(height_i - mean_height) * (weight_i - mean_weight)] / (n - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of individuals (20 in this case), and height_i and weight_i are the height and weight of the ith individual.\n\nCovariance = [(68-68.3)(165-164.95) + (72-68.3)(195-164.95) + ... + (72-68.3)(210-164.95)] / 19\n\nCovariance = [(-0.3)(0.05) + (3.7)(30.05) + ... + (3.7)(45.05)] / 19\n\nCovariance = [-0.015 + 111.185 + ... + 166.685] / 19\n\nCovariance = 114.835 / 19\n\nCovariance ≈ 89.21\n\nThe covariance between height and weight of the individuals in this group is approximately 89.21."
