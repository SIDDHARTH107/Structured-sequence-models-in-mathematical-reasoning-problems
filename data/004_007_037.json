    "message_1": "Sure! Here's an example question for a math student to solve using the chain rule to differentiate composite functions:\n\nSuppose that f(x) = (3x^2 - 7)^4 and g(x) = 2x - 1. Find the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x) at x = 2. \n\nIn other words, find the value of ((f ∘ g)'(2)), where (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)).",
    "message_2": "To find the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x) at x = 2, we will first find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) separately, and then apply the chain rule.\n\n1. Find the derivative of f(x) = (3x^2 - 7)^4:\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\nf'(x) = 4(3x^2 - 7)^3 * (6x)\n\n2. Find the derivative of g(x) = 2x - 1:\ng'(x) = 2\n\nNow, we will apply the chain rule to find the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x):\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\n3. Evaluate g(2):\ng(2) = 2(2) - 1 = 3\n\n4. Evaluate f'(g(2)):\nf'(3) = 4(3(3)^2 - 7)^3 * (6(3)) = 4(18)^3 * 18 = 147456\n\n5. Finally, evaluate (f ∘ g)'(2):\n(f ∘ g)'(2) = f'(g(2)) * g'(2) = 147456 * 2 = 294912\n\nSo, the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x) at x = 2 is 294912."
