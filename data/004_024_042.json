    "message_2": "To find dy/dx, we first need to implicitly differentiate the given equation with respect to x. \n\nGiven equation: x^2 + xy + y^2 = 16\n\nImplicit differentiation with respect to x:\n2x + y + x(dy/dx) + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx. \n\ndy/dx * (x + 2y) = -2x - y\n\ndy/dx = (-2x - y) / (x + 2y)\n\nNow, we can find dy/dx at the point (2, 2).\n\ndy/dx = (-2(2) - 2) / (2 + 2(2))\n\ndy/dx = (-4 - 2) / (2 + 4)\n\ndy/dx = -6 / 6\n\ndy/dx = -1\n\nSo, at the point (2, 2), the value of dy/dx is -1."
