    "message_1": "A math student needs to conduct a factor analysis on a dataset consisting of 10 variables. The student has a 1000-sample size. The dataset has a total variance of 500. The first factor accounts for 35% of the total variance, the second factor accounts for 25% of the total variance and the third factor accounts for 15% of the total variance. What is the proportion of the total variance explained by the first three factors combined?",
    "message_2": "To find the proportion of the total variance explained by the first three factors combined, we simply add the proportions of each factor together.\n\nFirst factor: 35%\nSecond factor: 25%\nThird factor: 15%\n\nCombined proportion: 35% + 25% + 15% = 75%\n\nSo, the first three factors combined account for 75% of the total variance."
