    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total Gaussian curvature of a closed surface is equal to 2π times its Euler characteristic (χ). For a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2.\n\nK_total = 2πχ\n\nFor a sphere, the Gaussian curvature K at any point is given by:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere. In this case, R = 10 units.\n\nK = 1/(10^2) = 1/100\n\nNow, we need to find the total Gaussian curvature K_total by integrating K over the entire surface of the sphere. However, since K is constant over the sphere, we can simplify the integral as follows:\n\nK_total = K * Surface Area\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nSurface Area = 4πR^2\n\nSo, the surface area of our sphere is:\n\nSurface Area = 4π(10^2) = 400π\n\nNow, we can find the total Gaussian curvature:\n\nK_total = K * Surface Area = (1/100) * 400π\n\nK_total = 4π\n\nSo, the total Gaussian curvature of the spherical surface with a radius of 10 units is 4π."
