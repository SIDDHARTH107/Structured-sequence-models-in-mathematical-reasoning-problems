    "message_2": "To determine if the curve C is smooth or not, we need to check if the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to each variable are simultaneously zero at any point on the curve.\n\nThe equation of the curve C is given by F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we need to check if there exists a point (x, y, z) on the curve C such that all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero:\n\n2x = 0 => x = 0\n2y = 0 => y = 0\n2z = 0 => z = 0\n\nThe only point that satisfies these conditions is (0, 0, 0). However, this point is not on the curve C, because it does not satisfy the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0 (since 0 ≠ 0).\n\nTherefore, there is no point on the curve C where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero. Hence, the curve C is a smooth curve."
