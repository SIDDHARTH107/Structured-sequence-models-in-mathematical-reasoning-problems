    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t.\n\nFirst derivatives:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = 3t^2 - 3, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t + 2, \\quad \\frac{dz}{dt} = 4$$\n\nSecond derivatives:\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 6t, \\quad \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = 2, \\quad \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = 0$$\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n$$k = \\frac{||T'(t)||}{||r'(t)||^3}$$\nwhere T'(t) is the derivative of the unit tangent vector and r'(t) is the first derivative of the position vector.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of the first derivative:\n$$||r'(t)|| = \\sqrt{(3t^2 - 3)^2 + (2t + 2)^2 + 4^2}$$\n\nAt t = 1:\n$$||r'(1)|| = \\sqrt{(3(1)^2 - 3)^2 + (2(1) + 2)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 16 + 16} = 4\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nNow, let's find the cross product of the first and second derivatives:\n$$T'(t) = r'(t) \\times r''(t) = \\begin{vmatrix} i & j & k \\\\ 3t^2 - 3 & 2t + 2 & 4 \\\\ 6t & 2 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = (8 - 8t)i - 24j + (6t - 6)k$$\n\nAt t = 1:\n$$T'(1) = (8 - 8(1))i - 24j + (6(1) - 6)k = 0i - 24j + 0k$$\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of T'(1):\n$$||T'(1)|| = \\sqrt{(-24)^2} = 24$$\n\nFinally, we can find the curvature at t = 1:\n$$k = \\frac{||T'(1)||}{||r'(1)||^3} = \\frac{24}{(4\\sqrt{2})^3} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ) using the formula:\n$$τ = \\frac{(r'(t) \\times r''(t)) \\cdot r'''(t)}{||r'(t) \\times r''(t)||^2}$$\n\nFirst, let's find the third derivatives:\n$$\\frac{d^3x}{dt^3} = 6, \\quad \\frac{d^3y}{dt^3} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^3z}{dt^3} = 0$$\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of T'(t) and r'''(t):\n$$T'(t) \\cdot r'''(t) = (8 - 8t)(6) + (-24)(0) + (6t - 6)(0) = 48 - 48t$$\n\nAt t = 1:\n$$T'(1) \\cdot r'''(1) = 48 - 48(1) = 0$$\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of T'(t) squared:\n$$||T'(t)||^2 = (8 - 8t)^2 + (-24)^2 + (6t - 6)^2$$\n\nAt t = 1:\n$$||T'(1)||^2 = 0^2 + (-24)^2 + 0^2 = 576$$\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion at t = 1:\n$$τ = \\frac{(r'(t) \\times r''(t)) \\cdot r'''(t)}{||r'(t) \\times r''(t)||^2} = \\frac{0}{576} = 0$$\n\nSo, the curvature at t = 1 is $\\frac{3}{8}$, and the torsion at t = 1 is 0."
