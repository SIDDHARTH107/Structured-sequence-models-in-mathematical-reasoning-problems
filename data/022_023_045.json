    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this into the wave equation:\n\nu_tt = 4u_xx => X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)\n\nNext, we divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = 4X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = 4X''(x)/X(x) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) T''(t) + λT(t) = 0\n2) X''(x) + (λ/4)X(x) = 0\n\nWe also have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = X(0)T(t) = 0\nu_x(1,t) = X'(1)T(t) = 0\n\nSince X(0)T(t) = 0 for all t, we must have X(0) = 0. Similarly, since X'(1)T(t) = 0 for all t, we must have X'(1) = 0.\n\nNow, we solve the ODEs. For equation (2), we have three cases:\n\nCase 1: λ/4 > 0\nThe general solution is X(x) = A*cos(√(λ/4)x) + B*sin(√(λ/4)x). Applying the boundary conditions, we get X(0) = A = 0 and X'(1) = B*√(λ/4)*cos(√(λ/4)) = 0. Since B cannot be zero (otherwise X(x) would be identically zero), we must have cos(√(λ/4)) = 0. This implies that √(λ/4) = (2n+1)π/2 for some integer n. Thus, λ = (2n+1)^2π^2.\n\nCase 2: λ/4 = 0\nIn this case, X(x) = Ax + B. Applying the boundary conditions, we get X(0) = B = 0 and X'(1) = A = 0. This leads to the trivial solution X(x) = 0, which is not useful.\n\nCase 3: λ/4 < 0\nThis case leads to complex solutions for X(x), which are not suitable for our problem.\n\nNow, we focus on case 1. For each λ = (2n+1)^2π^2, the corresponding ODE (1) becomes:\n\nT''(t) - (2n+1)^2π^2T(t) = 0\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C*cos((2n+1)πt) + D*sin((2n+1)πt)\n\nSince u_t(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0, we have D = 0. Thus, the solution for each λ is:\n\nu_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = B_n*sin((2n+1)πx)*cos((2n+1)πt)\n\nNow, we form the general solution as a sum of these solutions:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[B_n*sin((2n+1)πx)*cos((2n+1)πt)]\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(2πx):\n\nsin(2πx) = Σ[B_n*sin((2n+1)πx)*cos(0)]\n\nComparing the terms, we see that B_0 = 0 and B_n = 0 for n > 1. Thus, the final solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = B_1*sin(3πx)*cos(3πt)\n\nTo find B_1, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(2πx):\n\nsin(2πx) = B_1*sin(3πx)\n\nIntegrating both sides over the interval [0,1], we get:\n\n∫[0,1] sin(2πx) dx = B_1 * ∫[0,1] sin(3πx) dx\n\n(1/(2π))[cos(0) - cos(2π)] = B_1 * (1/(3π))[cos(0) - cos(3π)]\n\nB_1 = (2/3)\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = (2/3)*sin(3πx)*cos(3πt)"
