    "message_2": "First, we can represent the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 1 |\n| 5  6  7 | 2 |\n| 8  9 10 | 3 |\n\nNext, we will perform Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2.5 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row to eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows:\n\n|  2   3   4 |  1  |\n|  0  -1.5 -3 | -0.5|\n|  0  -3  -6 | -1  |\n\nStep 2: Multiply the second row by -2/3 to make the leading coefficient of y in the second row equal to 1:\n\n|  2   3    4  |  1  |\n|  0   1    2  |  1/3|\n|  0  -3   -6  | -1  |\n\nStep 3: Add 3 times the second row to the third row, and subtract 3 times the second row from the first row to eliminate the y terms in the first and third rows:\n\n|  2   0   -2 |  0  |\n|  0   1    2 | 1/3 |\n|  0   0    0 |  0  |\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the matrix. Notice that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true. This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express z as a free variable (let z = t) and solve for x and y in terms of z:\n\nFrom the second row: y + 2z = y + 2t = 1/3 => y = 1/3 - 2t\nFrom the first row: 2x - 2z = 2x - 2t = 0 => x = t\n\nSo the general solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = t\ny = 1/3 - 2t\nz = t\n\nwhere t is any real number."
