    "message_2": "To find the smallest integer x such that 3^x is congruent to 10 (mod 13), we can use the discrete logarithm. We want to find x in the equation:\n\n3^x ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n\nWe can start by finding the powers of 3 modulo 13:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n3^4 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n3^5 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n3^6 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nSince 3 is a primitive root modulo 13, we know that its powers will cycle through all the non-zero residues modulo 13. We can continue calculating the powers of 3 modulo 13:\n\n3^7 ≡ 3^3 * 3^4 ≡ 1 * 3 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n3^8 ≡ 3^4 * 3^4 ≡ 9 * 9 ≡ 81 ≡ 5 (mod 13)\n3^9 ≡ 3^6 * 3^3 ≡ 1 * 27 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n3^10 ≡ 3^6 * 3^4 ≡ 1 * 3 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n3^11 ≡ 3^6 * 3^5 ≡ 1 * 9 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n3^12 ≡ 3^6 * 3^6 ≡ 1 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nWe can see that 3^8 ≡ 5 (mod 13). To get 10 (mod 13), we can multiply both sides of the congruence by 2:\n\n2 * 3^8 ≡ 2 * 5 (mod 13)\n3^8 * 3^1 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n3^(8+1) ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n3^9 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the smallest integer x such that 3^x is congruent to 10 (mod 13) is x = 9."
