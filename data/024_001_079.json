    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametrization r(t).\n\nr'(t) = (4t, 6t, 5)\nr''(t) = (4, 6, 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the unit tangent vector T(t) and its derivative T'(t). The unit tangent vector T(t) is given by:\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nAt t = 1, r'(1) = (4, 6, 5). Now, we find the magnitude of r'(1):\n\n||r'(1)|| = √(4^2 + 6^2 + 5^2) = √(16 + 36 + 25) = √77\n\nSo, T(1) = (4/√77, 6/√77, 5/√77).\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the unit tangent vector T'(t). To do this, we can differentiate r'(t) / ||r'(t)|| component-wise with respect to t:\n\nT'(t) = (4/||r'(t)||, 6/||r'(t)||, 0)\n\nAt t = 1, T'(1) = (4/√77, 6/√77, 0).\n\nNow, we can find the curvature κ(t) using the formula:\n\nκ(t) = ||T'(t)||\n\nAt t = 1, κ(1) = ||(4/√77, 6/√77, 0)|| = √((4/√77)^2 + (6/√77)^2 + 0^2) = √(16/77 + 36/77) = √(52/77) = √52/√77.\n\nSo, the curvature at t = 1 is κ(1) = √52/√77.\n\nTo find the torsion τ(t), we need to find the unit normal vector N(t) and the unit binormal vector B(t). The unit normal vector N(t) is given by:\n\nN(t) = T'(t) / ||T'(t)||\n\nAt t = 1, N(1) = (4/√52, 6/√52, 0).\n\nThe unit binormal vector B(t) is given by:\n\nB(t) = T(t) x N(t)\n\nAt t = 1, B(1) = (4/√77, 6/√77, 5/√77) x (4/√52, 6/√52, 0) = (30/√(77*52), -20/√(77*52), 0).\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the unit binormal vector B'(t). To do this, we can differentiate B(t) component-wise with respect to t:\n\nB'(t) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nAt t = 1, B'(1) = (0, 0, 0).\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion τ(t) using the formula:\n\nτ(t) = -B'(t) • N(t)\n\nAt t = 1, τ(1) = -(0, 0, 0) • (4/√52, 6/√52, 0) = 0.\n\nSo, the torsion at t = 1 is τ(1) = 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the curvature of the space curve at t = 1 is κ(1) = √52/√77, and the torsion is τ(1) = 0."
