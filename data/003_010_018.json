    "message_1": "A flagpole casts a shadow of length 15 meters at the same time a person standing next to the flagpole casts a shadow of length 1.5 meters. If the person is 1.8 meters tall, what is the height of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the concept of similar triangles. The height of the flagpole and the person form two corresponding sides of two similar triangles, and the lengths of their shadows form the other two corresponding sides.\n\nLet the height of the flagpole be h meters. Then, we can set up a proportion:\n\n(height of flagpole) / (height of person) = (length of flagpole's shadow) / (length of person's shadow)\n\nh / 1.8 = 15 / 1.5\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 1.8 * (15 / 1.5)\n\nh = 1.8 * 10\n\nh = 18 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is 18 meters."
