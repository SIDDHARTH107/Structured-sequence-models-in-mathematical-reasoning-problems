    "message_1": "A  trigonometric  function  is represented by f(x) = 5 cos(3x + π/4). Calculate its amplitude and period.",
    "message_2": "The given trigonometric function is f(x) = 5 cos(3x + π/4).\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is A cos(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn this case, A = 5, B = 3, and C = π/4.\n\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is |5| = 5.\n\nThe period is calculated using the formula: Period = 2π / |B|. In this case, B = 3, so the period is 2π / |3| = 2π / 3.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude is 5 and the period is 2π/3."
