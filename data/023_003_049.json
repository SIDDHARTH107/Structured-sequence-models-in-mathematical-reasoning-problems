    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$. That is, we assume:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the given PDE, we get:\n\n$X(x)T'(t) = 9X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $XT$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{9T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the separation constant. We now have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $T'(t) = -9\\lambda T(t)$\n2. $X''(x) = -\\lambda X(x)$\n\nWe first solve the second equation with the given boundary conditions $X(0) = X(1) = 0$. This is an eigenvalue problem, and the eigenvalues are given by $\\lambda_n = (n\\pi)^2$ for $n=1,2,3,...$. The corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$.\n\nNow, we solve the first equation for each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$. The general solution is given by:\n\n$T_n(t) = Ce^{-9\\lambda_nt}$\n\nThe overall solution is a linear combination of the product of eigenfunctions and their corresponding time-dependent functions:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\sin(n\\pi x)e^{-9\\lambda_nt}$\n\nTo find the coefficients $a_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin^2(\\pi x)$. Plugging in $t=0$, we get:\n\n$\\sin^2(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nWe can use the identity $\\sin^2(\\pi x) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\pi x)$ to rewrite the initial condition as:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the sine and cosine terms, we find that $a_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $a_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 1$. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\pi x)e^{-9\\pi^2t}$\n\nFinally, we find the solution at time $t=0.5$:\n\n$u(x,0.5) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\pi x)e^{-\\frac{9\\pi^2}{2}}$"
