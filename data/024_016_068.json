    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of $X$ in the direction of the vector field $Y$ at the point $(1,1)$, we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols of the second kind for the given Riemannian metric $g$. Let $g_{ij}$ denote the components of the metric tensor and $g^{ij}$ denote the components of the inverse metric tensor. The Christoffel symbols are given by:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} + \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l})$$\n\nNow, let's compute the covariant derivative of $X$ in the direction of $Y$:\n\n$$\\nabla_Y X = (\\frac{\\partial X^1}{\\partial x^1} Y^1 + \\frac{\\partial X^1}{\\partial x^2} Y^2 + \\Gamma^1_{11} X^1 Y^1 + \\Gamma^1_{12} X^1 Y^2 + \\Gamma^1_{21} X^2 Y^1 + \\Gamma^1_{22} X^2 Y^2, \\frac{\\partial X^2}{\\partial x^1} Y^1 + \\frac{\\partial X^2}{\\partial x^2} Y^2 + \\Gamma^2_{11} X^1 Y^1 + \\Gamma^2_{12} X^1 Y^2 + \\Gamma^2_{21} X^2 Y^1 + \\Gamma^2_{22} X^2 Y^2)$$\n\nSince we are not given the explicit form of the Riemannian metric $g$, we cannot compute the Christoffel symbols. However, we can compute the partial derivatives of $X$ and evaluate them at the point $(1,1)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial X^1}{\\partial x^1} = 1, \\frac{\\partial X^1}{\\partial x^2} = 1, \\frac{\\partial X^2}{\\partial x^1} = 2x, \\frac{\\partial X^2}{\\partial x^2} = 2y$$\n\nAt the point $(1,1)$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial X^1}{\\partial x^1} = 1, \\frac{\\partial X^1}{\\partial x^2} = 1, \\frac{\\partial X^2}{\\partial x^1} = 2, \\frac{\\partial X^2}{\\partial x^2} = 2$$\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the expression for the covariant derivative:\n\n$$\\nabla_Y X = (Y^1 + Y^2 + \\Gamma^1_{11} X^1 Y^1 + \\Gamma^1_{12} X^1 Y^2 + \\Gamma^1_{21} X^2 Y^1 + \\Gamma^1_{22} X^2 Y^2, 2Y^1 + 2Y^2 + \\Gamma^2_{11} X^1 Y^1 + \\Gamma^2_{12} X^1 Y^2 + \\Gamma^2_{21} X^2 Y^1 + \\Gamma^2_{22} X^2 Y^2)$$\n\nAt the point $(1,1)$, the vector fields $X$ and $Y$ are given by:\n\n$$X(1,1) = (2,2), Y(1,1) = (-1,1)$$\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for the covariant derivative, we get:\n\n$$\\nabla_Y X = (-2 + \\Gamma^1_{11} (2)(-1) + \\Gamma^1_{12} (2)(1) + \\Gamma^1_{21} (2)(-1) + \\Gamma^1_{22} (2)(1), 0 + \\Gamma^2_{11} (2)(-1) + \\Gamma^2_{12} (2)(1) + \\Gamma^2_{21} (2)(-1) + \\Gamma^2_{22} (2)(1))$$\n\nWithout knowing the explicit form of the Riemannian metric $g$, we cannot compute the exact values of the covariant derivative. However, we have found the expression for the covariant derivative of $X$ in the direction of $Y$ at the point $(1,1)$ in terms of the Christoffel symbols."
