Suppose that φ: X → Y is a Mori fiber space with Picard number one and that E is the exceptional locus of φ. If F is a fiber of φ and C is an irreducible curve in E, with C∙F = 1, then show that if L∙C = 0, then φ⋆(L)∙F = 0. \n\nGiven that X is a surface with Picard number one, find the value of φ⋆(L)∙F if L∙C = 3 and F∙C = 2.",
    "message_2": "First, let's show that if L∙C = 0, then φ⋆(L)∙F = 0. Since L is an ample line bundle on X, we have that L is numerically effective (nef). Now, consider the intersection product L∙C. Since L∙C = 0 and L is nef, it follows that C is also numerically effective. \n\nNow, consider the pushforward φ⋆(L). Since φ is a Mori fiber space, we have that φ⋆(L) is also numerically effective. Moreover, since C is numerically effective and φ⋆(L) is numerically effective, their intersection product φ⋆(L)∙F is non-negative. \n\nRecall that C∙F = 1. Since L∙C = 0, we have φ⋆(L)∙C = 0. Now, using the projection formula, we have:\n\nφ⋆(L)∙F = φ⋆(L)∙(C∙F) = (φ⋆(L)∙C)∙F = 0∙F = 0.\n\nNow, let's find the value of φ⋆(L)∙F if L∙C = 3 and F∙C = 2. Since L∙C = 3, we have φ⋆(L)∙C = 3. Using the projection formula again, we have:\n\nφ⋆(L)∙F = φ⋆(L)∙(C∙F) = (φ⋆(L)∙C)∙F = 3∙F∙C = 3∙2 = 6.\n\nThus, the value of φ⋆(L)∙F is 6 when L∙C = 3 and F∙C = 2."
