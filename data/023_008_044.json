    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the non-periodic function f(x) = x/2 for -1 < x < 1, we first need to extend the function to be periodic. We can do this by defining f(x) as an odd function, meaning f(-x) = -f(x). This makes f(x) periodic with period 2.\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier coefficients using the Fourier sine series, since the function is odd. The Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(nπx))\n\nwhere b_n is the Fourier coefficient for the nth term. To find b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx) from -L/2 to L/2\n\nIn our case, L = 2, so the formula becomes:\n\nb_n = ∫(f(x) * sin(nπx) dx) from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we can plug in f(x) = x/2:\n\nb_n = ∫((x/2) * sin(nπx) dx) from -1 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x/2 and dv = sin(nπx) dx\nThen, du = 1/2 dx and v = -(1/(nπ))cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nb_n = [-(x/2)(1/(nπ))cos(nπx)] from -1 to 1 - ∫[-(1/(nπ))cos(nπx) * (1/2) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nNow, evaluate the first term:\n\n[-(1/2)(1/(nπ))cos(nπ) - (1/2)(1/(nπ))cos(-nπ)] = 0 (since cos(nπ) = cos(-nπ) and they cancel out)\n\nNow, we only need to evaluate the second term:\n\nb_n = (1/(2nπ)) * ∫[cos(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nb_n = (1/(2nπ)) * [sin(nπx)/(nπ)] from -1 to 1\n\nb_n = (1/(2nπ)) * [sin(nπ) - sin(-nπ)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = sin(-nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, we have:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nSo, all the Fourier coefficients b_n are 0, and the Fourier sine series representation of the function f(x) = x/2 for -1 < x < 1 is 0. This is because the function is not actually periodic with period 2, and we artificially extended it to be periodic. The Fourier series is not able to accurately represent the non-periodic nature of the original function."
