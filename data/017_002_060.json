    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we can use the fact that the subgroups of a cyclic group of order n are in one-to-one correspondence with the divisors of n. The divisors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Thus, there are five subgroups of G, each corresponding to one of these divisors.\n\nLet's find the generators for each of these subgroups:\n\n1. The subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element. This subgroup is cyclic since it has only one element.\n\n2. The subgroup of order 2 is generated by the element a^8, since (a^8)^2 = a^16 = e. This subgroup is {e, a^8} and is cyclic.\n\n3. The subgroup of order 4 is generated by the element a^4, since (a^4)^4 = a^16 = e. This subgroup is {e, a^4, a^8, a^12} and is cyclic.\n\n4. The subgroup of order 8 is generated by the element a^2, since (a^2)^8 = a^16 = e. This subgroup is {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10, a^12, a^14} and is cyclic.\n\n5. The subgroup of order 16 is generated by the element a, since a^16 = e. This subgroup is G itself and is cyclic.\n\nNow, we have found all the subgroups of G and shown that they are cyclic. The subgroups are:\n\n1. {e}\n2. {e, a^8}\n3. {e, a^4, a^8, a^12}\n4. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10, a^12, a^14}\n5. {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11, a^12, a^13, a^14, a^15}\n\nEach of these subgroups is cyclic, as required."
