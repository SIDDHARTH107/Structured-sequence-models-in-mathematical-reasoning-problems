    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one tree falling on the trail in the next 3 months, we can first find the probability of no trees falling on the trail in the next 3 months and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a tree not falling in a given month is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.\n\nFor three consecutive months, the probability of no trees falling is 0.80 * 0.80 * 0.80 = 0.512.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one tree falling by subtracting the probability of no trees falling from 1:\n\n1 - 0.512 = 0.488.\n\nSo, there is a 48.8% chance that at least one tree will fall on the trail in the next 3 months."
