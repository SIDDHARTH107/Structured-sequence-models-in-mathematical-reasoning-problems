    "message_1": "A 50 N force acts on an object moving along a straight line. If the object travels 10 meters in the direction of the force, how much work is done by the force? Use integration to find the work done.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nW = ∫F dx\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force, and dx is the displacement in the direction of the force. In this case, the force is constant (50 N) and the object travels 10 meters in the direction of the force.\n\nSo, we can set up the integral as follows:\n\nW = ∫(50) dx from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nW = 50x | from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = 50(10) - 50(0)\n\nW = 500 - 0\n\nW = 500 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 500 Joules."
