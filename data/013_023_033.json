    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A is given 20 tokens and must decide how many tokens to send to Player B. Whatever Player A sends, Player B's tokens will be tripled. Player B must then decide how many tokens to send back to Player A. If Player B decides to send back 30 tokens, how many tokens did Player A send in the first place?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of tokens Player A sends to Player B. After tripling, Player B receives 3x tokens. Since Player B sends back 30 tokens to Player A, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3x - 30 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x = 30\nx = 30 / 3\nx = 10\n\nSo, Player A sent 10 tokens to Player B in the first place."
