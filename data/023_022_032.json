    "message_2": "To find the dominant frequency of the stock's price fluctuations, we will first compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the given price data and then identify the frequency with the highest magnitude.\n\nThe DFT is defined as:\n\n$X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\cdot e^{-i 2 \\pi k n / N}$\n\nwhere $x_n$ is the input sequence (stock prices), $N$ is the number of data points (30 in this case), and $X_k$ is the output sequence (Fourier coefficients).\n\nLet's compute the DFT for the given stock prices:\n\n1. Subtract the mean price from each price to remove the DC component (constant offset):\n\n$P_{mean} = \\frac{1}{30} \\sum_{n=1}^{30} P_n \\approx 19.87$\n\n$P'_n = P_n - P_{mean}$\n\n2. Compute the DFT:\n\n$X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{29} P'_n \\cdot e^{-i 2 \\pi k n / 30}$ for $k = 0, 1, ..., 29$\n\n3. Calculate the magnitude of each Fourier coefficient:\n\n$|X_k| = \\sqrt{(\\text{Re}(X_k))^2 + (\\text{Im}(X_k))^2}$\n\n4. Identify the dominant frequency:\n\n$k_{max} = \\text{argmax}_{k} |X_k|$ for $k = 1, ..., 14$ (we only consider half of the frequencies due to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem)\n\n5. Compute the dominant frequency in terms of days:\n\n$f_{dominant} = \\frac{k_{max}}{30}$\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we find that the dominant frequency is approximately $0.1$ cycles per day. This means that the most significant fluctuation in the stock's price occurs with a period of about 10 days."
