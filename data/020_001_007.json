The company has a production capacity of 200 units per day and the demand for product A is at least twice the demand for product B. Write a linear programming problem to maximize the company's profit.",

Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 200\n2. Demand constraint: x ≥ 2y\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y ≥ 0\n\nThe linear programming problem can be written as:\n\nMaximize P = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to:\nx + y ≤ 200\nx ≥ 2y\nx, y ≥ 0"
