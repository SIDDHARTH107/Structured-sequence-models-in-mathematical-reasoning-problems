    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation sin(2x) + cos(x) = 1 for x in the interval [0, 2π], we can use the double angle identity for sine:\n\nsin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) + cos(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can factor out cos(x):\n\ncos(x)(2sin(x) + 1) = 1\n\nFor this equation to be true, either cos(x) = 0 or (2sin(x) + 1) = 1.\n\nCase 1: cos(x) = 0\nx = π/2, 3π/2\n\nCase 2: 2sin(x) + 1 = 1\n2sin(x) = 0\nsin(x) = 0\nx = 0, π, 2π\n\nSo the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π"
