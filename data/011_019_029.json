    "message_1": "A company has 3 different machines and they want to test the quality of their products. They conduct a series of tests where each product must be processed with 2 of the 3 machines. If they want to test 12 products, how many different combinations of machine tests are needed using an OA(3,2,4)?",
    "message_2": "An OA(3,2,4) is an orthogonal array with 3 factors (machines), 2 levels (each product being processed by 2 machines), and strength 4 (meaning that every combination of 2 machines appears 4 times in the array). \n\nThere are 3 possible pairs of machines that can be used to process each product: (Machine 1, Machine 2), (Machine 1, Machine 3), and (Machine 2, Machine 3). Since each combination appears 4 times in the array, there will be a total of 3 pairs * 4 repetitions = 12 tests.\n\nSo, to test 12 products using an OA(3,2,4), 12 different combinations of machine tests are needed."
