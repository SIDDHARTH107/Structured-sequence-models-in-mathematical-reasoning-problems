    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start with the first fundamental form.\n\nGiven the surface equation z = 2x^2 - 3y^2, we can define the position vector r(u, v) as:\n\nr(u, v) = <u, v, 2u^2 - 3v^2>\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = dr/du = <1, 0, 4u>\nr_v = dr/dv = <0, 1, -6v>\n\nNow we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = <1, 0, 4u> • <1, 0, 4u> = 1 + 16u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = <1, 0, 4u> • <0, 1, -6v> = -24uv\nG = r_v • r_v = <0, 1, -6v> • <0, 1, -6v> = 1 + 36v^2\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form. We need to find the second partial derivatives of r:\n\nr_uu = d^2r/du^2 = <0, 0, 4>\nr_uv = d^2r/dudv = <0, 0, -6>\nr_vv = d^2r/dv^2 = <0, 0, -12>\n\nNow, we need to find the unit normal vector N at the point (1, -1, -1). We can find it by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v and then normalizing the result:\n\nN = (r_u × r_v) / ||r_u × r_v||\n\nN = <1, 0, 4u> × <0, 1, -6v> / ||<1, 0, 4u> × <0, 1, -6v>||\n\nN = <4u, 24uv, 4> / sqrt((4u)^2 + (24uv)^2 + 4^2)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, -1), we have u = 1 and v = -1:\n\nN = <4, 24, 4> / sqrt(16 + 576 + 16) = <4, 24, 4> / 24 = <1/6, 1, 1/6>\n\nNow we can find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = N • r_uu = <1/6, 1, 1/6> • <0, 0, 4> = 2/3\nM = N • r_uv = <1/6, 1, 1/6> • <0, 0, -6> = -1\nN = N • r_vv = <1/6, 1, 1/6> • <0, 0, -12> = -2\n\nNow we can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the following equation:\n\ndet(A - kI) = 0\n\nwhere A is the matrix of the second fundamental form coefficients and I is the identity matrix:\n\nA = | L  M |\n    | M  N |\n\nA - kI = | L - k  M   |\n          | M    N - k |\n\ndet(A - kI) = (L - k)(N - k) - M^2 = 0\n\nPlugging in the values of L, M, and N, we get:\n\n(2/3 - k)(-2 - k) - (-1)^2 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\n(2/3 - k)(-2 - k) + 1 = 0\n(-4/3 + 2k/3 + k^2) + 1 = 0\nk^2 + 2k/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\nNow we can use the quadratic formula to find the principal curvatures k1 and k2:\n\nk = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 2/3, and c = -1/3:\n\nk1, k2 = (-(2/3) ± sqrt((2/3)^2 - 4(1)(-1/3))) / 2(1)\n\nk1, k2 = (-2/3 ± sqrt(4/9 + 4/3)) / 2\n\nk1, k2 = (-2/3 ± sqrt(16/9)) / 2\n\nk1, k2 = (-2/3 ± 4/3) / 2\n\nSo we have two principal curvatures:\n\nk1 = (-2/3 + 4/3) / 2 = 1/3\nk2 = (-2/3 - 4/3) / 2 = -1\n\nThus, the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, -1) are k1 = 1/3 and k2 = -1."
