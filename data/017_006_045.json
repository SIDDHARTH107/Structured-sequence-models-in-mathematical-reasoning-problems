    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has 35 elements. The prime factorization of 35 is 5 * 7, which are both prime numbers. According to the Sylow theorems, we can determine the possible structures of a group of order 35.\n\n1. Sylow 5-subgroups: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 7 (the index of 5 in the factorization) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1. Thus, there is a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5.\n\n2. Sylow 7-subgroups: The number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n_7) must divide 5 (the index of 7 in the factorization) and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility for n_7 is 1. Thus, there is a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow 7-subgroup of order 7.\n\nSince both Sylow subgroups are normal, the group of order 35 must be the direct product of these two subgroups. Therefore, the only possible structure for a group of order 35 is the cyclic group of order 35, which is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, i.e., Z_5 Ã— Z_7."
