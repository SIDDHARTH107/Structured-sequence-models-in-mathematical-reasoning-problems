    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology groups of M, we first note that M is a two-dimensional torus, which can be represented as a quotient space of the Euclidean plane R^2 by the lattice L generated by two linearly independent vectors, say (a,0) and (0,b). In other words, M = R^2 / L.\n\nThe De Rham cohomology groups of M can be computed using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, but since M is a compact orientable surface, we can use the following general result for compact orientable surfaces of genus g:\n\nH^0(M) = R (since M is connected)\nH^1(M) = R^(2g) (where g is the genus of M)\nH^2(M) = R (since M is compact and orientable)\n\nIn our case, M is a torus, which has genus 1. Therefore, the De Rham cohomology groups of M are:\n\nH^0(M) = R\nH^1(M) = R^2\nH^2(M) = R\n\nNow, let's compute the de Rham cohomology classes represented by the forms df and d(df).\n\nThe function f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is defined on R^3, but we are considering it as a function on M, so we can restrict it to the x-y plane (since M is a quotient of R^2). In this case, f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2, and its differential is given by:\n\ndf = 2x dx + 2y dy\n\nNow, let's compute the exterior derivative of df:\n\nd(df) = d(2x dx + 2y dy) = 2(dx ∧ dx) + 2(dy ∧ dy) = 0\n\nSince d(df) = 0, df is a closed form. However, df is not exact, because it cannot be written as the exterior derivative of another form on M. This is because the integral of df along a non-contractible loop in M (e.g., a loop that goes around the torus) is non-zero. Therefore, df represents a non-trivial cohomology class in H^1(M).\n\nIn summary, the de Rham cohomology classes represented by the forms df and d(df) are:\n\n[df] ∈ H^1(M) is a non-trivial class\n[d(df)] ∈ H^2(M) is the trivial class (since d(df) = 0)"
