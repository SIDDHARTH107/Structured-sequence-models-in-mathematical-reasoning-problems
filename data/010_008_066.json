That is, $\\chi = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k b_k$, where $b_k$ is the $k$-th Betti number, which counts the number of independent $k$-dimensional cycles in the complex.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex formed by gluing together two tetrahedra along a common face, we need to count the number of vertices, edges, and faces in the resulting complex.\n\nLet's denote the two tetrahedra as $T_1$ and $T_2$. Each tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces. When we glue them together along a common face, we identify 3 vertices, 3 edges, and 1 face from each tetrahedron. \n\nAfter gluing, the total number of vertices is $4 + 4 - 3 = 5$, since we have identified 3 vertices. The total number of edges is $6 + 6 - 3 = 9$, since we have identified 3 edges. The total number of faces is $4 + 4 - 1 = 7$, since we have identified 1 face.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic using the formula $\\chi = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k b_k$. In this case, we have:\n\n$\\chi = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 5 - 9 + 7 = 3$\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex formed by gluing together two tetrahedra along a common face is 3."
