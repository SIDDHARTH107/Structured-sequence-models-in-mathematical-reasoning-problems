    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 6x + 5 on the interval [0, 3], we can use calculus or complete the square method. Here, we will use calculus.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 - 6x + 5)/dx = 4x - 6\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n4x - 6 = 0\n4x = 6\nx = 3/2\n\nSince the interval is [0, 3], we need to check the value of the function at the endpoints and at the critical point:\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^2 - 6(0) + 5 = 5\nf(3/2) = 2(3/2)^2 - 6(3/2) + 5 = -0.5\nf(3) = 2(3)^2 - 6(3) + 5 = 5\n\nThe minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 3] is f(3/2) = -0.5."
