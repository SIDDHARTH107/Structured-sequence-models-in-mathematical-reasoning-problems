If a sample of 36 light bulbs is randomly selected, what is the probability that the average weight of the bulbs in the sample is less than 24.5 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of z-scores in a normal distribution. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation or data point is from the mean. \n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error of the mean (SEM), which is the standard deviation of the sample mean. The formula for the SEM is:\n\nSEM = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = 2 grams, and n = 36.\n\nSEM = 2 / √36 = 2 / 6 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333 grams\n\nNext, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 24.5 grams. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SEM\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SEM is the standard error of the mean.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 24.5 grams, and μ = 25 grams.\n\nz = (24.5 - 25) / 0.333 ≈ -1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -1.5. We can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the area to the left of -1.5 in a standard normal distribution.\n\nThe area to the left of -1.5 is approximately 0.0668, or 6.68%.\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the bulbs in the sample is less than 24.5 grams is approximately 6.68%."
