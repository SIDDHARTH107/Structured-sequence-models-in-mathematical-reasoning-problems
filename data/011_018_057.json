    "message_1": "In a block design experiment, a researcher is studying the effects of three different fertilizer types (F1, F2, and F3) on the growth of four different crops (C1, C2, C3, and C4). The researcher needs to arrange the crops in blocks of size 3, where each block contains exactly one instance of each crop and only one fertilizer type can be used in each block. How many blocks are needed to complete the experiment?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of blocks needed to complete the experiment, we need to consider all possible combinations of crops and fertilizer types.\n\nThere are 4 crops (C1, C2, C3, and C4) and each block must contain exactly 3 of them. The number of ways to choose 3 crops out of 4 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 4 (total number of crops) and k = 3 (number of crops per block):\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 different combinations of crops that can be used in each block.\n\nNow, we need to consider the 3 different fertilizer types (F1, F2, and F3). Each block will have only one fertilizer type. Therefore, for each of the 4 crop combinations, there will be 3 possible blocks with different fertilizer types.\n\nSo, the total number of blocks needed to complete the experiment is:\n\n4 crop combinations * 3 fertilizer types = 12 blocks"
