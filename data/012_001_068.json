    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between Node A and Node F, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (Node A) as 0 and the distances to all other nodes as infinity.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (Node A) and mark it as visited.\n3. Update the distances to its neighbors (Nodes B and C) by adding the edge weights to the current distance.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (Node F) is visited.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E, F}\n   Distances: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞, E=∞, F=∞\n\n2. Select Node A (smallest distance), mark as visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E, F}\n\n3. Update distances to neighbors B and C:\n   Distances: A=0, B=5, C=3, D=∞, E=∞, F=∞\n\n4. Select Node C (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark as visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, D, E, F}\n\n5. Update distances to neighbors D and E:\n   Distances: A=0, B=5, C=3, D=4, E=8, F=∞\n\n6. Select Node D (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark as visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, E, F}\n\n7. Update distances to neighbors E and F:\n   Distances: A=0, B=5, C=3, D=4, E=8, F=8\n\n8. Select Node B (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark as visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {E, F}\n\n9. No need to update distances since Node B's neighbors have already been visited.\n\n10. Select Node F (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark as visited.\n    Unvisited nodes: {E}\n\nSince we have visited the target node (Node F), we can stop the algorithm. The shortest path is A -> C -> D -> F with a total weight of 8."
