    "message_1": "Suppose two players, A and B, are playing a centipede game which has 6 rounds. Player A moves first and has the option to take a $10 reward or to pass. If A passes, B then has the option to take the $10 reward or pass, and so on for the remaining rounds. Each round that a player passes, the reward for the next round doubles. If they decide to take the reward, the game is over. \n\nWhat is the maximum possible payoff for each player if they play optimally?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible payoff for each player if they play optimally, we can work backwards from the last round.\n\nIn the 6th round, if A passes, B can take $320. So, in the 5th round, A should take $160, as passing would lead to B getting a higher reward.\n\nIn the 4th round, if B passes, A can take $160 in the next round. So, B should take $80 in the 4th round, as passing would lead to A getting a higher reward.\n\nIn the 3rd round, if A passes, B can take $80 in the next round. So, A should take $40 in the 3rd round, as passing would lead to B getting a higher reward.\n\nIn the 2nd round, if B passes, A can take $40 in the next round. So, B should take $20 in the 2nd round, as passing would lead to A getting a higher reward.\n\nIn the 1st round, if A passes, B can take $20 in the next round. So, A should take $10 in the 1st round, as passing would lead to B getting a higher reward.\n\nSo, the maximum possible payoff for each player if they play optimally is $10 for player A and $20 for player B."
