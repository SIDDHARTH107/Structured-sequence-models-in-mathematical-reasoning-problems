    "message_1": "Suppose an investor wants to select a portfolio consisting of two stocks, Stock A and Stock B. The expected annual return from Stock A is 12% with a standard deviation of 8%, while the expected annual return from Stock B is 16% with a standard deviation of 12%. The correlation coefficient between the two stocks is 0.6. The investor would like to invest a total of $500,000 in the portfolio with the constraint that no more than 60% of the total investment should be in a single stock.\n\nWhat is the optimal portfolio allocation for the investor that maximizes the expected return while satisfying the given constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the proportion of the investment in Stock A, and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in Stock B. The constraint is that no more than 60% of the total investment should be in a single stock, which means 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.6.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by the weighted average of the expected returns of the two stocks:\n\nExpected Return = x * 12% + (1-x) * 16%\n\nThe portfolio's variance is given by the following formula:\n\nVariance = x^2 * (8%)^2 + (1-x)^2 * (12%)^2 + 2 * x * (1-x) * 0.6 * 8% * 12%\n\nTo find the optimal portfolio allocation, we need to maximize the expected return while satisfying the given constraints. We can do this by taking the derivative of the expected return with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Expected Return)/dx = 12% - 16% = -4%\n\nSince the derivative is constant and negative, the expected return is decreasing as x increases. Therefore, to maximize the expected return, we should choose the smallest possible value for x that satisfies the constraint, which is x = 0.4.\n\nSo, the optimal portfolio allocation is 40% in Stock A and 60% in Stock B. In terms of the total investment of $500,000, this means investing $200,000 in Stock A and $300,000 in Stock B."
