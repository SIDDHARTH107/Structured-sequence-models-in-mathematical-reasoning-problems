    "message_2": "The fundamental group of a torus is well-known to be $\\pi_1(X, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$. To see this, consider the standard representation of the torus as a square with opposite sides identified. Choose a base point $p$ in the interior of the square. There are two natural loops based at $p$: one that goes around the square horizontally (call it $a$), and one that goes around the square vertically (call it $b$). These loops generate the fundamental group, and it can be shown that they commute and are independent, so $\\pi_1(X, p) \\cong \\langle a, b \\mid ab = ba \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, let's classify the covering spaces of $X$ up to isomorphism. By the classification theorem for covering spaces, there is a bijection between the isomorphism classes of connected covering spaces of $X$ and the conjugacy classes of subgroups of $\\pi_1(X, p)$. Since $\\pi_1(X, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ is abelian, its conjugacy classes are just its subgroups.\n\nThe subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ are of the form $m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus n\\mathbb{Z}$ for non-negative integers $m$ and $n$. There are four cases to consider:\n\n1. $m = 0, n = 0$: This corresponds to the trivial subgroup, which gives the universal cover of $X$. The universal cover of a torus is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n2. $m = 0, n > 0$: This corresponds to the subgroups of the form $0 \\oplus n\\mathbb{Z}$. The corresponding covering spaces are infinite cylinders, which can be thought of as \"stacks\" of $n$-fold tori.\n\n3. $m > 0, n = 0$: This corresponds to the subgroups of the form $m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0$. The corresponding covering spaces are also infinite cylinders, but with the tori \"stacked\" in the other direction.\n\n4. $m > 0, n > 0$: This corresponds to the subgroups of the form $m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus n\\mathbb{Z}$. The corresponding covering spaces are finite-sheeted tori, with $mn$ tori arranged in an $m \\times n$ grid. Each torus in the grid is connected to its neighbors by $m$ vertical loops and $n$ horizontal loops.\n\nIn summary, the covering spaces of a torus up to isomorphism are the Euclidean plane, infinite cylinders, and finite-sheeted tori arranged in grids."
