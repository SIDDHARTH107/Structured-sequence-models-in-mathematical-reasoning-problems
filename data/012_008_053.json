    "message_2": "To determine if the given graph is planar, we can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nThe given graph has 6 vertices and 7 edges. It is clear that it cannot contain K5 as a subgraph since K5 has 5 vertices and 10 edges, which is more than the given graph. Now let's check for K3,3.\n\nK3,3 has two sets of vertices (3 in each set) such that every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set. In the given graph, we can find such sets:\n\nSet 1: {A, B, C}\nSet 2: {D, E, F}\n\nVertices A, B, and C are connected to D, E, and F. However, vertex A is not connected to vertex E, which means the graph does not contain K3,3 as a subgraph.\n\nSince the graph does not contain K5 or K3,3 as subgraphs, it is planar."
