The cost of producing each unit is given by the function C(x) = 0.03x^2 + 15x + 5000, where x represents the number of units produced. Find the rate of change of the cost when 1000 units are produced per week using the product rule.",
    "message_2": "To find the rate of change of the cost when 1000 units are produced per week, we need to find the derivative of the cost function C(x) with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 1000.\n\nThe cost function is given by C(x) = 0.03x^2 + 15x + 5000.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of C(x) with respect to x:\n\nC'(x) = d/dx (0.03x^2 + 15x + 5000)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nC'(x) = 0.06x + 15\n\nNow, let's evaluate C'(x) at x = 1000:\n\nC'(1000) = 0.06(1000) + 15\n\nC'(1000) = 60 + 15\n\nC'(1000) = 75\n\nSo, the rate of change of the cost when 1000 units are produced per week is $75 per unit."
