    "message_2": "The order of an element in a cyclic group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element. The order of a cyclic group G generated by an element 'a' is the order of 'a'. In this case, the order of G is 20.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of H are divisors of 20, which are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum order of any element in H. If H has an element of order 20, then H would be equal to G, since it would generate the whole group G. In this case, the maximum order of any element in H would be 20.\n\nHowever, if H is a proper subgroup of G (i.e., H is not equal to G), then the maximum order of any element in H must be less than 20. The largest proper divisor of 20 is 10, so the maximum order of any element in H, when H is a proper subgroup, is 10.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum order of any element of H is 10 when H is a proper subgroup of G, and 20 when H is equal to G."
