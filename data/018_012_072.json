To show this, let's consider another example:\n\nLet A = {1}, B = {2}, and C = {3}. We want to show that (A × B) × C ≠ A × (B × C).\n\nA × B = {(1, 2)}\nB × C = {(2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 2), 3)}\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (2, 3))}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) × C ≠ A × (B × C), because {((1, 2), 3)} ≠ {(1, (2, 3))}. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
