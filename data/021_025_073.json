    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to maximize their profit by determining the optimal number of units of a product to produce. The production cost per unit of the product is $50, and the selling price per unit is $80. The company has a constraint that the total production cost cannot exceed $5,000. Using the Whale Optimization Algorithm, what is the optimal number of units to produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), which is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. However, since this is a relatively simple problem, we can also solve it using basic algebra.\n\nLet x be the number of units produced.\nThe total production cost is 50x, and the constraint is that this cost cannot exceed $5,000.\nSo, 50x ≤ 5,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\nx ≤ 100.\n\nThe profit per unit is the selling price minus the production cost, which is $80 - $50 = $30.\nThe total profit is 30x.\n\nSince x cannot be more than 100, the optimal number of units to produce to maximize profit is 100 units. The company should produce 100 units to maximize their profit under the given constraint."
