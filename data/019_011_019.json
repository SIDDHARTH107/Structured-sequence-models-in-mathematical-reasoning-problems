    "message_2": "Let's use relevance logic to solve the problem:\n\nPremise 1: Sharon is 26 years old.\nPremise 2: All 26-year-olds are eligible to vote.\n\nWe can represent these premises using logical statements:\n\nPremise 1: S = 26 (Sharon's age is 26)\nPremise 2: ∀x (x = 26 → E(x)) (For all x, if x is 26 years old, then x is eligible to vote)\n\nNow, we want to determine if Sharon is eligible to vote. We can represent this as:\n\nConclusion: E(S) (Sharon is eligible to vote)\n\nUsing the premises, we can deduce the conclusion:\n\n1. S = 26 (Premise 1)\n2. ∀x (x = 26 → E(x)) (Premise 2)\n3. S = 26 → E(S) (Instantiation of premise 2 for Sharon)\n4. E(S) (Modus Ponens: From 1 and 3)\n\nSo, based on relevance logic, Sharon is eligible to vote. Answer: Yes."
