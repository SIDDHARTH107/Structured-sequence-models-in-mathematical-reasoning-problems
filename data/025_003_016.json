    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the projective variety $V$, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the homogeneous polynomial $f(x, y, z)$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nThe partial derivatives of $f(x, y, z)$ are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = -y^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y, z)$ where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$-2yz = 0 \\Rightarrow yz = 0$\n\n$-y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nFrom the above equations, we have two cases:\n\n1) $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. In this case, we get the point $(0, 0, z)$, which is not a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ since at least one coordinate must be nonzero.\n\n2) $x = 0$ and $yz = 0$. In this case, we have two subcases:\n\na) $y = 0$ and $z \\neq 0$. Then, the point is $(0, 0, z)$, which is not a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\nb) $z = 0$ and $x = 0$. Then, the point is $(0, y, 0)$, which is a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. So, the singular point is $(0, 1, 0)$, up to scalar multiplication.\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent lines to $V$ at the singular point $(0, 1, 0)$. To do this, we can use the partial derivatives as the coefficients of the tangent lines:\n\n$3x^2(0) - 2y(1)z(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow 0 = 0$\n\n$-2(1)z(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow 0 = 0$\n\n$-(1)^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow 0 = 0$\n\nSince all three equations are identically zero, the tangent lines to $V$ at the singular point $(0, 1, 0)$ are the lines through the point $(0, 1, 0)$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. These lines are given by the equation $z = 0$, which represents the line at infinity in the projective plane."
