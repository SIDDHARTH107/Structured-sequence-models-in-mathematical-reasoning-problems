    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be represented as:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nx = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n10 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we need to find orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R as follows:\n\nQ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1/\\sqrt{14} & 2/\\sqrt{6} & 1/\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n-2/\\sqrt{14} & -1/\\sqrt{6} & 1/\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n-3/\\sqrt{14} & -1/\\sqrt{6} & 1/\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nR = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{14} & -\\sqrt{14}/2 & -\\sqrt{14}/2 \\\\\n0 & \\sqrt{6} & \\sqrt{6}/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sqrt{3}/3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^Tb.\n\nFirst, we find Q^Tb:\n\nQ^Tb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1/\\sqrt{14} & -2/\\sqrt{14} & -3/\\sqrt{14} \\\\\n2/\\sqrt{6} & -1/\\sqrt{6} & -1/\\sqrt{6} \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{3} & 1/\\sqrt{3} & 1/\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n10 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-20/\\sqrt{14} \\\\\n2/\\sqrt{6} \\\\\n20/\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb using back substitution:\n\nR = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{14} & -\\sqrt{14}/2 & -\\sqrt{14}/2 \\\\\n0 & \\sqrt{6} & \\sqrt{6}/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sqrt{3}/3\n\\end{bmatrix} x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-20/\\sqrt{14} \\\\\n2/\\sqrt{6} \\\\\n20/\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving for x, y, and z, we get:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 1\n\nSo, the solution of the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
