Suppose that the Cartan connection of M is given by a matrix-valued 1-form A on M. \n\nFind A at the point p = (1, 0, 0) ∈ M such that A_p(v) = -v, where v is the tangent vector of M at p.",
    "message_2": "To find the matrix-valued 1-form A at the point p = (1, 0, 0), we first need to determine the tangent space T_pM at p. Since M is defined by the equation x² + y² + z² = 1, we can compute the gradient of this function at p:\n\n∇(x² + y² + z²) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\nAt p = (1, 0, 0), the gradient is (2, 0, 0). The tangent space T_pM is orthogonal to the gradient, so we can find two linearly independent tangent vectors that span T_pM:\n\nv₁ = (0, 1, 0)\nv₂ = (0, 0, 1)\n\nNow, we are given that A_p(v) = -v for any tangent vector v. Therefore, we can compute A_p(v₁) and A_p(v₂):\n\nA_p(v₁) = -v₁ = (0, -1, 0)\nA_p(v₂) = -v₂ = (0, 0, -1)\n\nSince A is a matrix-valued 1-form, we can represent A_p as a matrix that acts on the tangent vectors v₁ and v₂:\n\nA_p = | a₁₁  a₁₂ | \n      | a₂₁  a₂₂ |\n\nApplying A_p to v₁ and v₂, we get:\n\nA_p(v₁) = | a₁₁  a₁₂ | (0) = (0, -1, 0)\n          | a₂₁  a₂₂ | (1)\n\nA_p(v₂) = | a₁₁  a₁₂ | (0) = (0, 0, -1)\n          | a₂₁  a₂₂ | (1)\n\nFrom these equations, we can deduce the values of the matrix elements:\n\na₁₁ = 0, a₁₂ = -1\na₂₁ = 0, a₂₂ = 0\n\nThus, the matrix-valued 1-form A at the point p = (1, 0, 0) is given by:\n\nA_p = |  0  -1 | \n      |  0   0  |"
