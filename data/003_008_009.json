    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. We can use the sine and cosine functions to do this.\n\nLet's call the side opposite the 30-degree angle \"a\" and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle \"b\". We can use the sine and cosine functions as follows:\n\nsin(30) = a / 10\ncos(30) = b / 10\n\nWe know that sin(30) = 1/2 and cos(30) = √3/2. So, we can write the equations as:\n\n1/2 = a / 10\n√3/2 = b / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for \"a\" and \"b\":\n\na = 10 * (1/2) = 5 cm\nb = 10 * (√3/2) = 5√3 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of the other two sides, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is \"b\" and the height is \"a\":\n\nArea = (1/2) * 5√3 * 5\nArea = (1/2) * 25√3\nArea = 12.5√3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 12.5√3 cm²."
