    "message_1": "A factory has 200 employees, out of which 20 operate heavy machinery. The probability of a workplace accident occurring is 0.01 for heavy machinery operators and 0.004 for other employees. What is the probability of a workplace accident occurring during a day in which 5 randomly chosen employees work with heavy machinery?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem into parts. First, we need to find the probability of each employee having an accident. Then, we will use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of a workplace accident occurring during a day when 5 randomly chosen employees work with heavy machinery.\n\n1. Probability of an accident for heavy machinery operators (HMO): P(HMO) = 0.01\n2. Probability of an accident for other employees (OE): P(OE) = 0.004\n\nNow, let's find the probability of a workplace accident occurring during a day when 5 randomly chosen employees work with heavy machinery.\n\nWe will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x successes (accidents) in n trials (employees)\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time\n- p is the probability of success (accident) for each trial (employee)\n- n is the number of trials (employees)\n- x is the number of successes (accidents)\n\nSince there are 5 randomly chosen employees, we have n = 5. We want to find the probability of at least one accident occurring, so we will calculate the probability of no accidents and subtract it from 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of no accidents for heavy machinery operators and other employees:\n\nP(0 accidents for HMO) = C(5, 0) * (0.01)^0 * (1-0.01)^(5-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.99)^5 ≈ 0.951\n\nP(0 accidents for OE) = C(5, 0) * (0.004)^0 * (1-0.004)^(5-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.996)^5 ≈ 0.980\n\nNow, let's find the probability of no accidents for the 5 randomly chosen employees:\n\nP(0 accidents) = P(0 accidents for HMO) * P(0 accidents for OE) ≈ 0.951 * 0.980 ≈ 0.932\n\nFinally, we will find the probability of at least one accident occurring:\n\nP(at least 1 accident) = 1 - P(0 accidents) ≈ 1 - 0.932 ≈ 0.068\n\nSo, the probability of a workplace accident occurring during a day in which 5 randomly chosen employees work with heavy machinery is approximately 0.068 or 6.8%."
