    "message_2": "To determine a 95% confidence interval for the true mean score of the entire population of students, we will use the formula for the confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean\nz = z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (for a 95% confidence interval, z = 1.96)\nσ = sample standard deviation\nn = sample size\n\nIn this case, we have:\nx̄ = 75\nσ = 5\nn = 50\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 75 ± (1.96 * (5 / √50))\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard error = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (z * standard error):\n\nMargin of error = 1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.3859\n\nFinally, we can find the confidence interval:\n\nCI = 75 ± 1.3859\nCI = (75 - 1.3859, 75 + 1.3859)\nCI = (73.6141, 76.3859)\n\nThus, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean score of the entire population of students is approximately (73.61, 76.39)."
