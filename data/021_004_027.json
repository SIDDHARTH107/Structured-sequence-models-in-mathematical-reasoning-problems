    "message_2": "a) The three-point backward finite difference formula for the first derivative is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x) - 4f(x - h) + 3f(x - 2h)) / (2h)\n\nWe want to find the first derivative at x = 2 with a step size of h = 0.1. First, we need to calculate the function values at x = 2, x = 2 - 0.1, and x = 2 - 2(0.1):\n\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 4(2) - 1 = 16 - 12 + 8 - 1 = 11\nf(1.9) = 2(1.9)^3 - 3(1.9)^2 + 4(1.9) - 1 ≈ 9.578\nf(1.8) = 2(1.8)^3 - 3(1.8)^2 + 4(1.8) - 1 ≈ 8.392\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (11 - 4(9.578) + 3(8.392)) / (2 * 0.1) ≈ (-1.632) / 0.2 ≈ -8.16\n\nSo, the approximation for the first derivative of f(x) at x = 2 using the three-point backward finite difference formula is -8.16.\n\nb) The five-point centered finite difference formula for the second derivative is given by:\n\nf''(x) ≈ (-f(x - 2h) + 16f(x - h) - 30f(x) + 16f(x + h) - f(x + 2h)) / (12h^2)\n\nWe want to find the second derivative at x = 1 with a step size of h = 0.01. First, we need to calculate the function values at x = 1, x = 1 ± 0.01, and x = 1 ± 2(0.01):\n\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = 2\nf(0.99) = 2(0.99)^3 - 3(0.99)^2 + 4(0.99) - 1 ≈ 1.9703\nf(1.01) = 2(1.01)^3 - 3(1.01)^2 + 4(1.01) - 1 ≈ 2.0303\nf(0.98) = 2(0.98)^3 - 3(0.98)^2 + 4(0.98) - 1 ≈ 1.9412\nf(1.02) = 2(1.02)^3 - 3(1.02)^2 + 4(1.02) - 1 ≈ 2.0608\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf''(1) ≈ (-1.9412 + 16(1.9703) - 30(2) + 16(2.0303) - 2.0608) / (12 * 0.01^2) ≈ 11.9996\n\nSo, the approximation for the second derivative of f(x) at x = 1 using the five-point centered finite difference formula is 11.9996."
