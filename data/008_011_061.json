    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing each column with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz).\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2  3  4 |\n| 4  5  6 |\n| 7  8  9 |\n\nTo find the determinant D:\nD = 2((5*9) - (6*8)) - 3((4*9) - (6*7)) + 4((4*8) - (5*7))\nD = 2(45 - 48) - 3(36 - 42) + 4(32 - 35)\nD = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 4(-3)\nD = -6 + 18 - 12\nD = 0\n\nSince the determinant D is 0, Cramer's rule cannot be applied to this system of linear equations. The system is either inconsistent (no solution) or dependent (infinitely many solutions). In this case, the system is dependent, as the second equation is a multiple of the first equation (2x the first equation), and the third equation is the sum of the first two equations. There are infinitely many solutions for this system."
