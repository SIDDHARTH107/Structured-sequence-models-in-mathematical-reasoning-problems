    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the third equation by -4 and add it to the second equation:\n\n-4(x + 4y + 2z) = -4(10)\n-4x - 16y - 8z = -40\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n\n4x + 2y + 3z = 8\n-4x - 16y - 8z = -40\n----------------------\n-14y - 5z = -32 (1)\n\nNext, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the third equation:\n\n-2(2x + 3y + 5z) = -2(12)\n-4x - 6y - 10z = -24\n\nNow, add this to the third equation:\n\n-4x - 6y - 10z = -24\nx + 4y + 2z = 10\n----------------------\n-3x - 2y - 8z = -14 (2)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n-14y - 5z = -32 (1)\n-2y - 8z = -14 (2)\n\nLet's eliminate y from these two equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 7 and add it to the first equation:\n\n7(-2y - 8z) = 7(-14)\n-14y - 56z = -98\n\nNow, add this to the first equation:\n\n-14y - 5z = -32\n-14y - 56z = -98\n----------------------\n-51z = -66\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = -66 / -51\nz = 22/17\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into equations (1) and (2) to find y:\n\n-14y - 5(22/17) = -32\n-14y - 110/17 = -32\n\nMultiply both sides by 17:\n\n-238y - 110 = -544\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n-238y = -434\ny = 434/238\ny = 31/17\n\nNow that we have y and z, we can substitute them back into the original first equation to find x:\n\n2x + 3(31/17) + 5(22/17) = 12\n\nMultiply both sides by 17:\n\n34x + 93 + 110 = 204\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n34x = 1\nx = 1/34\n\nSo, the solution for the system of equations is:\n\nx = 1/34\ny = 31/17\nz = 22/17"
