    "message_1": "A string of length 2 meters is fixed at both ends. When it is plucked, the wave propagation problem is given by $y_{tt}=c^2y_{xx}$, where $c=5$ m/s. At $t=0$, the string is plucked to an initial deflection of $y(x,0)=5\\sin(\\pi x)$ and is at rest, $\\frac{\\partial y(x,0)}{\\partial t}=0$. What is the displacement $y(x,t)$ of the string at time $t=0.1$ seconds, using the Fourier transform method to solve the wave propagation problem?",
    "message_2": "To solve the wave propagation problem using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the initial deflection $y(x, 0) = 5\\sin(\\pi x)$. Since the string is fixed at both ends, we can use the sine series representation:\n\n$$y(x, 0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $L = 2$ meters is the length of the string, and $B_n$ are the Fourier coefficients. In this case, we already have the sine series representation, so we can identify $B_1 = 5$ and $B_n = 0$ for $n > 1$.\n\nNext, we need to find the time-dependent part of the solution. Since the string is initially at rest, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial y(x, 0)}{\\partial t} = 0$$\n\nThe general solution of the wave equation is given by:\n\n$$y(x, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[A_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi ct}{L}\\right) + B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi ct}{L}\\right)\\right] \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $A_n$ and $B_n$ are the Fourier coefficients. Since the string is initially at rest, we have $A_n = 0$ for all $n$. Thus, the solution simplifies to:\n\n$$y(x, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi ct}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for $B_n$, $c$, $L$, and $t$ to find the displacement $y(x, t)$ at time $t = 0.1$ seconds:\n\n$$y(x, 0.1) = 5 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi c (0.1)}{2}\\right) \\sin(\\pi x)$$\n\n$$y(x, 0.1) = 5 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi (5)(0.1)}{2}\\right) \\sin(\\pi x)$$\n\n$$y(x, 0.1) = 5 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\sin(\\pi x)$$\n\n$$y(x, 0.1) = 5 \\sin(\\pi x)$$\n\nSo, the displacement of the string at time $t = 0.1$ seconds is $y(x, 0.1) = 5 \\sin(\\pi x)$."
