    "message_2": "To prove that f has a fixed point, we will use the given property of f: f(f(x)) = f(x) for all x ∈ X.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary element y ∈ X. We know that f(y) ∈ X since f: X → X. Now, let's consider the element f(y).\n\nBy the given property, we have f(f(y)) = f(y). Let's set x = f(y). Then, we have f(x) = x, where x = f(y) and x ∈ X.\n\nThus, we have found an element x ∈ X such that f(x) = x, which means f has a fixed point."
