    "message_2": "To use the Jacobi iterative method, we first rewrite the given system of linear equations in the form of x = f(x, y, z), y = g(x, y, z), and z = h(x, y, z):\n\nx = (6 - 2y - 3z)/1\ny = (4 - 2x - 2z)/5\nz = (7 - 2x - 3y)/8\n\nNow, we will use the Jacobi iterative method to find the solution. We start with an initial guess for the solution, say x0 = 0, y0 = 0, and z0 = 0. Then, we iteratively update the values of x, y, and z using the following formulas:\n\nx_(k+1) = (6 - 2y_k - 3z_k)/1\ny_(k+1) = (4 - 2x_k - 2z_k)/5\nz_(k+1) = (7 - 2x_k - 3y_k)/8\n\nWe will perform a few iterations to get closer to the solution:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (6 - 2*0 - 3*0)/1 = 6\ny1 = (4 - 2*0 - 2*0)/5 = 0.8\nz1 = (7 - 2*0 - 3*0)/8 = 0.875\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (6 - 2*0.8 - 3*0.875)/1 = 3.35\ny2 = (4 - 2*6 - 2*0.875)/5 = -1.35\nz2 = (7 - 2*6 - 3*0.8)/8 = -0.4625\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (6 - 2*(-1.35) - 3*(-0.4625))/1 = 4.7375\ny3 = (4 - 2*3.35 - 2*(-0.4625))/5 = -0.055\nz3 = (7 - 2*3.35 - 3*(-1.35))/8 = 0.95625\n\nWe can continue iterating until the values of x, y, and z converge to a certain level of accuracy. For the sake of brevity, we will stop here. The approximate solution after 3 iterations is:\n\nx ≈ 4.7375\ny ≈ -0.055\nz ≈ 0.95625\n\nMore iterations would provide a more accurate solution."
