    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the matrix A. The characteristic equation is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [2 - λ, 1; 1, 2 - λ]\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\n|(A - λI)| = (2 - λ)(2 - λ) - (1)(1) = λ^2 - 4λ + 4 - 1 = λ^2 - 4λ + 3\n\nNow, we solve the characteristic equation for λ:\n\nλ^2 - 4λ + 3 = 0\n\n(λ - 1)(λ - 3) = 0\n\nλ1 = 1, λ2 = 3\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are 1 and 3.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n\n[1, 1; 1, 1] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n\nx1 + x2 = 0\nx1 = -x2\n\nWe can choose x2 = 1, so x1 = -1. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 1 is:\n\nv1 = [-1; 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 3:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n\n[-1, 1; 1, -1] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n\n- x1 + x2 = 0\nx1 = x2\n\nWe can choose x1 = 1, so x2 = 1. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 3 is:\n\nv2 = [1; 1]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 3, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [-1; 1] and v2 = [1; 1]."
