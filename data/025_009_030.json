    "message_2": "The j-invariant is an invariant of elliptic curves that can be used to classify them up to isomorphism. In particular, two elliptic curves are isomorphic over a field if and only if they have the same j-invariant. \n\nThe j-invariant of an elliptic curve E given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B is defined as:\n\nj(E) = 1728 * (4A^3) / (4A^3 + 27B^2)\n\nWe are given that j(E) = 1728, so we have:\n\n1728 = 1728 * (4A^3) / (4A^3 + 27B^2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1 = (4A^3) / (4A^3 + 27B^2)\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n27B^2 = 4A^3 - 4A^3\n\nThis implies that 4A^3 = 27B^2, which means that A^3 = 27/4 * B^2. Since A and B are rational numbers, we can write A = a/b and B = c/d, where a, b, c, and d are integers. Then, we have:\n\n(a/b)^3 = 27/4 * (c/d)^2\n\nClearing the denominators, we get:\n\na^3 * d^2 = 27 * b^3 * c^2 / 4\n\nSince the left side is an integer, the right side must also be an integer. This means that b^3 must be divisible by 4, so b must be even. Let b = 2k for some integer k. Then, we have:\n\na^3 * d^2 = 27 * (2k)^3 * c^2 / 4\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\na^3 * d^2 = 27 * 8 * k^3 * c^2\n\na^3 * d^2 = 216 * k^3 * c^2\n\nNow, we can see that a^3 must be divisible by 216. Since 216 = 2^3 * 3^3, a must be divisible by 2 and 3. Let a = 6m for some integer m. Then, we have:\n\n(6m)^3 * d^2 = 216 * k^3 * c^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n216 * m^3 * d^2 = 216 * k^3 * c^2\n\nCancelling the common factor of 216, we obtain:\n\nm^3 * d^2 = k^3 * c^2\n\nThis equation shows that m^3 is divisible by k^3, so m is divisible by k. Similarly, d^2 is divisible by c^2, so d is divisible by c. Therefore, the elliptic curve E can be written in the form:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + (6m)^2 * x + (6m)^3\n\nSince the coefficients of the curve are determined by m, each value of m corresponds to a distinct elliptic curve with j-invariant equal to 1728. However, we are interested in the number of distinct elliptic curves up to isomorphism over the field of rational numbers.\n\nIt turns out that there is only one such curve, which is the curve with m = 1. This is because any other curve with a different value of m can be transformed into the curve with m = 1 by an appropriate change of variables. Specifically, if we have a curve with m = n, we can make the substitution x = nx' and y = n^2 * y' to obtain the curve with m = 1:\n\ny'^2 = x'^3 + 36x' + 216\n\nThus, there is only one distinct elliptic curve over the field of rational numbers with j-invariant equal to 1728 up to isomorphism."
