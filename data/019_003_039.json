    "message_1": "Consider the following formula in modal logic: \n\n□(p → q) → (□p → □q)\n\nLet p and q be propositional variables. \nIf □(p → q) is true and □p is true, is □q necessarily true? \n\nProvide a proof or counterexample.",
    "message_2": "Yes, □q is necessarily true if □(p → q) and □p are true. Here's a proof:\n\n1. Assume □(p → q) is true.\n2. Assume □p is true.\n3. Since □(p → q) is true, it means that in every possible world w, (p → q) is true.\n4. Since □p is true, it means that in every possible world w, p is true.\n5. Now, consider an arbitrary possible world w. Since (p → q) is true in w (from step 3) and p is true in w (from step 4), we can infer that q is true in w (by the definition of the material conditional).\n6. Since q is true in every possible world w (from step 5), it follows that □q is true.\n\nThus, if □(p → q) and □p are true, then □q is necessarily true."
