    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of all dogs in that breed using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample the original dataset with replacement to create a new dataset of the same size (15 dogs).\n2. Calculate the mean weight of the new dataset.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (e.g., 10,000 times) to create a distribution of mean weights.\n4. Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of mean weights to find the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the original dataset, we can't perform the bootstrapping process directly. However, we can use the information given to approximate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution.\n\nGiven the sample size (n = 15), the sample mean (x̄ = 22.5 kg), and the sample standard deviation (s = 3.2 kg), we can calculate the standard error (SE) as follows:\n\nSE = s / sqrt(n) = 3.2 / sqrt(15) ≈ 0.826\n\nNext, we need to find the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 14 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14). Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the t-score is approximately 2.145.\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME) as follows:\n\nME = t-score * SE = 2.145 * 0.826 ≈ 1.77\n\nFinally, we can determine the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of all dogs in that breed:\n\nLower limit = x̄ - ME = 22.5 - 1.77 ≈ 20.73 kg\nUpper limit = x̄ + ME = 22.5 + 1.77 ≈ 24.27 kg\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of all dogs in that breed is approximately (20.73 kg, 24.27 kg)."
