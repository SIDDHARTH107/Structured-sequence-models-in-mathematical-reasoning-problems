    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × length × width × height\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 7 cm × 5 cm × 9 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 315 cm³\n\nVolume = 105 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 105 cm³."
