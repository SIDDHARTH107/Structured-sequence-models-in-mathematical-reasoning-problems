    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people affected by the disease) out of n trials (the group of 500 people)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a person with the genetic trait being affected by the disease, which is 0.08)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the group of 500 people)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, exactly 20 people affected by the disease)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 20) = C(500, 20) * (0.08)^20 * (1 - 0.08)^(500 - 20)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(500, 20):\n\nC(500, 20) = 500! / (20!(500 - 20)!)\nC(500, 20) = 500! / (20! * 480!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 20) = C(500, 20) * (0.08)^20 * (0.92)^480\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nC(500, 20) ≈ 4.6327 * 10^20\n(0.08)^20 ≈ 1.1529 * 10^-14\n(0.92)^480 ≈ 1.0092 * 10^-9\n\nNow, multiply these values together:\n\nP(X = 20) ≈ (4.6327 * 10^20) * (1.1529 * 10^-14) * (1.0092 * 10^-9)\nP(X = 20) ≈ 5.397 * 10^-3\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 20 people with the genetic trait will be affected by the disease in a group of 500 people is approximately 0.0054 or 0.54%."
