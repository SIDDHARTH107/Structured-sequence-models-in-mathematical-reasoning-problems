    "message_2": "Let's consider two even numbers, A and B. By definition, an even number can be expressed as the product of 2 and some integer. So, we can write:\n\nA = 2 * m (where m is an integer)\nB = 2 * n (where n is an integer)\n\nNow, let's find the sum of A and B:\n\nA + B = (2 * m) + (2 * n)\n\nWe can factor out the common factor of 2:\n\nA + B = 2 * (m + n)\n\nSince m and n are integers, their sum (m + n) is also an integer. Let's call this integer k:\n\nA + B = 2 * k\n\nAs the sum of A and B can be expressed as the product of 2 and an integer (k), the sum of two even numbers (A + B) is always even. This completes the proof."
