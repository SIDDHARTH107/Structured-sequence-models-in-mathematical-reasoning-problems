    "message_2": "To apply the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to ensure that the conditions are met. The theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet's consider the position function of the car, s(t), where s(t) represents the distance traveled by the car at time t. We are given that the car travels 120 km in 2 hours, so we have the following information:\n\ns(0) = 0 km (initial position)\ns(2) = 120 km (position after 2 hours)\n\nThe average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 2] is given by:\n\n(Δs) / (Δt) = (s(2) - s(0)) / (2 - 0) = (120 - 0) / (2 - 0) = 120 / 2 = 60 km/hr\n\nNow, we need to show that there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the position function, s'(c), is equal to the average rate of change, which is 60 km/hr. The derivative of the position function, s'(t), represents the velocity of the car at time t.\n\nSince the car is traveling on a straight road, we can assume that its position function is continuous and differentiable on the interval (0, 2). Therefore, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem.\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that:\n\ns'(c) = (s(2) - s(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\ns'(c) = 60 km/hr\n\nSo, at some point during the trip (at time c), the car was traveling exactly 60 km/hr."
