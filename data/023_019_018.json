    "message_1": "A simple question that a math student can solve on \"Using the Fourier transform to analyze the stability of systems\" is as follows:\n\nSuppose the input-output equation of a linear system is given by y(t) + 5y'(t) = 3x(t) + 4x'(t). Determine whether the system is stable or unstable using the Fourier transform. If the system is unstable, find the growth rate. \n\nNote: y(t) and x(t) denote the output and input of the system, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the system, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given input-output equation. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is denoted by F(ω) and is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the given equation, we have:\n\nY(ω) + 5jωY(ω) = 3X(ω) + 4jωX(ω)\n\nwhere Y(ω) and X(ω) are the Fourier transforms of y(t) and x(t), respectively.\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) of the system, which is the ratio of the output Y(ω) to the input X(ω):\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / X(ω) = (3 + 4jω) / (1 + 5jω)\n\nThe system is stable if all the poles of H(ω) have negative real parts. The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator of H(ω) is zero:\n\n1 + 5jω = 0\n\nSolving for ω, we get:\n\nω = -1/5j\n\nSince the real part of the pole is zero, the system is neither stable nor unstable. It is marginally stable, which means that the output will not grow unbounded, but it will not decay to zero either. Therefore, there is no growth rate in this case."
