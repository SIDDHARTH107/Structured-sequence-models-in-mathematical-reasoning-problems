Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the context of solving partial differential equations using finite element methods:\n\nConsider the partial differential equation:\n\nu_xx + u_yy = -sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)\n\nover the domain [0,1] x [0,1] with boundary conditions\n\nu(0,y) = 0, u(1,y) = 0, u(x,0) = 0, u(x,1) = 0.\n\nApproximate the solution to this equation using the finite element method with linear triangular elements, with a mesh of 10 x 10 triangles. Use the Galerkin approach and solve the resulting linear system of equations using a direct solver. Finally, plot the approximate solution using color-mapping on the mesh.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the finite element method with linear triangular elements, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the mesh of 10 x 10 triangles.\n2. Define the basis functions and their gradients.\n3. Assemble the stiffness matrix and load vector.\n4. Apply the boundary conditions.\n5. Solve the linear system of equations.\n6. Plot the approximate solution using color-mapping on the mesh.\n\nStep 1: Create the mesh\nDivide the domain [0,1] x [0,1] into a 10 x 10 grid of squares, and then divide each square into two triangles. The total number of triangles will be 200, and the total number of nodes will be 121.\n\nStep 2: Define the basis functions and their gradients\nFor linear triangular elements, the basis functions are linear functions of the form:\n\nphi_i(x, y) = a_i + b_i*x + c_i*y\n\nThe gradients of the basis functions are given by:\n\ngrad(phi_i) = (b_i, c_i)\n\nStep 3: Assemble the stiffness matrix and load vector\nThe stiffness matrix A and load vector F are given by:\n\nA_ij = ∫∫_Ω (grad(phi_i) * grad(phi_j)) dΩ\nF_i = ∫∫_Ω (phi_i * f(x, y)) dΩ\n\nwhere f(x, y) = -sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)\n\nStep 4: Apply the boundary conditions\nSince u(x,0) = u(x,1) = u(0,y) = u(1,y) = 0, we can eliminate the corresponding rows and columns in the stiffness matrix and load vector.\n\nStep 5: Solve the linear system of equations\nUse a direct solver to solve the linear system of equations:\n\nA * U = F\n\nwhere U is the vector of the unknown coefficients of the approximate solution.\n\nStep 6: Plot the approximate solution using color-mapping on the mesh\nUsing the coefficients obtained in step 5, we can plot the approximate solution u(x, y) = ∑ U_i * phi_i(x, y) using color-mapping on the mesh.\n\nNote that the actual implementation of these steps would require programming in a suitable language (e.g., Python, MATLAB, etc.) and using appropriate libraries for mesh generation, linear solvers, and plotting."
