    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A has $10 to split with Player B. Player A suggests a division, and Player B can either accept or reject it. If Player B accepts, both players keep their agreed-upon shares. If Player B rejects, both players receive nothing. What is the minimum amount of money Player B should accept if both players are rational and self-interested?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, if both players are rational and self-interested, Player B should accept any amount greater than $0. This is because receiving any amount of money is better than receiving nothing. However, Player A, being rational and self-interested, would likely offer the smallest amount possible to maximize their own share, knowing that Player B would accept it to avoid getting nothing. So, the minimum amount Player B should accept is $0.01 (assuming the division can be made in cents)."
