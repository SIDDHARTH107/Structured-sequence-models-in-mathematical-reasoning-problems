    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 5 cm and a hypotenuse of length 13 cm. What is the length of the other side?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the other side \"a\".\n\nThe formula is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given that the base (b) is 5 cm and the hypotenuse (c) is 13 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\na^2 + 5^2 = 13^2\na^2 + 25 = 169\n\nNow, we need to solve for a:\n\na^2 = 169 - 25\na^2 = 144\na = âˆš144\na = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other side (a) is 12 cm."
