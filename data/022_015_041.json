Use the Schwarz reflection principle to extend $f(z)$ to the lower half plane $\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\text{Im}(z) < 0\\}$, and then find the pole of the extended function $f(z)$ closest to the real axis in the lower half plane.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find a function that is analytic on the real axis and coincides with $f(z)$ on the real axis. Let's consider the function $g(z) = f(z) + f(\\overline{z})$. We have:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2-1} + \\frac{1}{\\overline{z}^2-1}$$\n\nNow, let's check if $g(z)$ is analytic on the real axis. If $z$ is real, then $\\overline{z} = z$, and we have:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2-1} + \\frac{1}{z^2-1} = \\frac{2}{z^2-1}$$\n\nSince $g(z)$ is a rational function and its denominator does not vanish on the real axis, $g(z)$ is analytic on the real axis.\n\nNow, we can define the extended function $f_{ext}(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$f_{ext}(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z), & \\text{Im}(z) > 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}g(z), & \\text{Im}(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nNow, let's find the poles of $f_{ext}(z)$ in the lower half plane. The poles of $f(z)$ are at $z = \\pm 1$. Since $f_{ext}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}g(z)$ in the lower half plane, we need to find the poles of $g(z)$ in the lower half plane. We have:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2-1} + \\frac{1}{\\overline{z}^2-1} = \\frac{\\overline{z}^2 - z^2 + 2z\\overline{z}}{(z^2-1)(\\overline{z}^2-1)}$$\n\nThe poles of $g(z)$ are the same as the poles of $f(z)$, which are at $z = \\pm 1$. However, since we are interested in the poles in the lower half plane, we need to find the pole of $f_{ext}(z)$ closest to the real axis in the lower half plane. The pole at $z = -1$ is in the upper half plane, so the pole closest to the real axis in the lower half plane is at $z = 1$."
