    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 5x^3 + 4x + 1 using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we first need to define the parameters for the algorithm:\n\n1. Search space: [-4, 4]\n2. Number of iterations: 100\n3. Number of employed bees: 50 (half of the total bees)\n4. Number of onlooker bees: 50 (half of the total bees)\n\nNow, let's implement the ABC algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the positions of the employed bees randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each employed bee using the function f(x).\n3. For each employed bee, generate a new position within the search space and evaluate its fitness. If the new position has a better fitness, replace the old position with the new one.\n4. Calculate the probability of selecting each employed bee based on their fitness.\n5. For each onlooker bee, select an employed bee based on the calculated probabilities, generate a new position within the search space, and evaluate its fitness. If the new position has a better fitness, replace the old position with the new one.\n6. Find the best solution among all the employed bees.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for the specified number of iterations (100 in this case).\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm for 100 iterations, we will find the minimum value of the function f(x) within the search space [-4, 4]. Note that the ABC algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, so the solution may not be the exact global minimum but an approximation of it."
