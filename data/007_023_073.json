    "message_1": "A cryptographic hash function H(x) maps an input message x of any length to a fixed-length hash value. Consider a hash function that produces a 64-bit hash value, and assume that it is a perfect hash function, what is the probability that two different input messages produce the same hash value?",
    "message_2": "A perfect hash function is assumed to have a uniform distribution of hash values, meaning that each possible hash value is equally likely to be produced. In this case, the hash function produces a 64-bit hash value, which means there are 2^64 possible hash values.\n\nThe probability that two different input messages produce the same hash value is equivalent to the probability of a hash collision. To calculate this probability, we can use the birthday paradox formula, which is based on the birthday problem. The birthday paradox states that in a set of n randomly chosen people, the probability that at least two of them share the same birthday is approximately p(n) = 1 - e^(-n^2 / 2m), where m is the number of possible birthdays (in our case, the number of possible hash values).\n\nHowever, since we are only considering two input messages, we can simplify the problem. The probability that the first input message has any hash value is 1 (since it can have any of the 2^64 possible hash values). The probability that the second input message has a different hash value is (2^64 - 1) / 2^64, since there are (2^64 - 1) remaining hash values that are different from the first input message's hash value.\n\nTherefore, the probability that two different input messages produce the same hash value (a hash collision) is:\n\n1 - (2^64 - 1) / 2^64 = 1 / 2^64\n\nSo, the probability of a hash collision for a perfect 64-bit hash function is 1 / 2^64."
