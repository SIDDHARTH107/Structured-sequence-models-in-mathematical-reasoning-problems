    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (also called the circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference = 2 * π * radius\n\nGiven that the radius is 5 centimeters, we can plug it into the formula:\n\nCircumference = 2 * π * 5\n\nCircumference ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 5\n\nCircumference ≈ 31.4159 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 31.4159 centimeters."
