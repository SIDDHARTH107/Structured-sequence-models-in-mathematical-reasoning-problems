    "message_2": "To find the diagonal form of a matrix, we need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then form a diagonal matrix using the eigenvalues. Let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given matrix A:\n\nA = [1 2]\n      [3 4]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\n|A - λI| = |1-λ  2  |\n                   |  3   4-λ|\n\n|A - λI| = (1-λ)(4-λ) - (2)(3)\n|A - λI| = λ^2 - 5λ - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ - 2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nλ = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4(-2))) / 2\nλ = (5 ± √(33)) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + √33) / 2 and λ2 = (5 - √33) / 2.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nFor each eigenvalue, we need to find the corresponding eigenvector by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = (5 + √33) / 2:\n\n(A - λ1I)v = [(1 - (5 + √33) / 2)  2] [x1] = [0]\n                          [  3   (4 - (5 + √33) / 2)] [x2]   [0]\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v1 = [1, (3 - √33) / 4].\n\nFor λ2 = (5 - √33) / 2:\n\n(A - λ2I)v = [(1 - (5 - √33) / 2)  2] [x1] = [0]\n                          [  3   (4 - (5 - √33) / 2)] [x2]   [0]\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v2 = [1, (3 + √33) / 4].\n\n3. Form the diagonal matrix using the eigenvalues:\n\nD = [λ1   0]\n       [  0   λ2]\n\nD = [(5 + √33) / 2      0]\n       [          0        (5 - √33) / 2]\n\nSo, the diagonal form of the matrix A is:\n\nD = [(5 + √33) / 2      0]\n       [          0        (5 - √33) / 2]"
