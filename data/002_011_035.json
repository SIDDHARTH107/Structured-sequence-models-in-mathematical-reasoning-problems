    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 6 cm and a hypotenuse of length 13 cm. What is the length of the perpendicular side using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the base a, the perpendicular side b, and the hypotenuse c.\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe are given the values of a and c:\n\na = 6 cm\nc = 13 cm\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n\n(6)^2 + b^2 = (13)^2\n36 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 169 - 36\nb^2 = 133\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √133\nb ≈ 11.53 cm\n\nSo, the length of the perpendicular side is approximately 11.53 cm."
