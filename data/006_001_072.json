    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting 7 heads and 3 tails in 10 coin flips, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of getting k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips), which is 10\n- k is the number of successes (heads), which is 7\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X=7) = C(10, 7) * 0.5^7 * 0.5^(10-7)\n\nFirst, we calculate C(10, 7):\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!3!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120\n\nNow, we calculate the probability:\n\nP(X=7) = 120 * 0.5^7 * 0.5^3 = 120 * 0.0078125 * 0.125 = 0.1171875\n\nSo, the probability of getting 7 heads and 3 tails in 10 coin flips is approximately 0.1172, or 11.72%."
