    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to the Traveler's Dilemma in Game Theory:\n\nTwo travelers A and B are each asked to choose a whole number between 0 and 100 (inclusive), without knowing the other's choice. The traveler who chooses the lower number gets a reward of $2 less than their chosen number, while the other traveler gets a reward of $2 less than the higher number chosen. If both travelers choose the same number, they both receive a reward of $2 less than that number. What numbers should A and B choose in order to maximize their total reward, assuming they each aim to maximize their own reward?\n\nWhat are the optimal numbers that A and B should choose, and what is the total reward that they will receive?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation. If traveler A chooses 100, traveler B can choose 99 and get a reward of $97, while traveler A gets a reward of $98. If traveler A chooses 99, traveler B can choose 98 and get a reward of $96, while traveler A gets a reward of $97. This pattern continues, with each traveler trying to choose a number just below the other's choice to maximize their reward.\n\nHowever, if both travelers realize this pattern, they will both choose the lowest possible number, which is 0, to avoid the other getting a higher reward. In this case, they both receive a reward of $-2 (since it's $2 less than the chosen number).\n\nSo, the optimal strategy for both travelers is to choose 0, as it prevents the other from getting a higher reward. The total reward they will receive is $-2 + $-2 = $-4. This result may seem counterintuitive, but it's a consequence of both travelers trying to maximize their own reward in a competitive setting."
