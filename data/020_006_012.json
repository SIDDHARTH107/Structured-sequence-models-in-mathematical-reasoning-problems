    "message_1": "A company is planning to produce two types of products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 4 units of material X and 2 units of material Y, while each unit of Product B requires 3 units of material X and 4 units of material Y. The company has 120 units of material X and 80 units of material Y. If the profit for each unit of Product A is $20 and for each unit of Product B is $30, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit while ensuring that all the available materials are used up completely?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the materials are:\n4x + 3y ≤ 120 (Material X constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 80 (Material Y constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities.\n\nFor Material X constraint:\n4x + 3y ≤ 120\ny ≥ (120 - 4x) / 3\n\nFor Material Y constraint:\n2x + 4y ≤ 80\ny ≤ (80 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ 20 - 0.5x\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of these inequalities. We can find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the equations:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (120 - 4x) / 3 and y = 20 - 0.5x:\n(120 - 4x) / 3 = 20 - 0.5x\n120 - 4x = 60 - 1.5x\n60 = 2.5x\nx = 24\n\ny = 20 - 0.5(24) = 8\n\nCorner point: (24, 8)\n\n2. Intersection of y = (120 - 4x) / 3 and x = 0:\ny = (120 - 4(0)) / 3 = 40\n\nCorner point: (0, 40)\n\n3. Intersection of y = 20 - 0.5x and x = 0:\ny = 20 - 0.5(0) = 20\n\nCorner point: (0, 20)\n\nNow we need to evaluate the objective function P = 20x + 30y at each corner point:\n\nP(24, 8) = 20(24) + 30(8) = 480 + 240 = 720\nP(0, 40) = 20(0) + 30(40) = 0 + 1200 = 1200\nP(0, 20) = 20(0) + 30(20) = 0 + 600 = 600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 40) with a profit of $1200. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B to maximize their profit while using up all the available materials."
