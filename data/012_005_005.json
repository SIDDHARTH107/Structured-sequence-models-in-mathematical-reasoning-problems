    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In this case, we can find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices and then determine the longest of these paths.\n\nHere are the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices:\n\n1-2: 1\n1-3: 1\n1-4: 2 (1-2-4)\n1-5: 2 (1-2-5)\n1-6: 2 (1-3-6)\n1-7: 2 (1-3-7)\n1-8: 3 (1-3-7-8)\n\n2-3: 2 (2-1-3)\n2-4: 1\n2-5: 1\n2-6: 3 (2-1-3-6)\n2-7: 3 (2-1-3-7)\n2-8: 4 (2-1-3-7-8)\n\n3-4: 3 (3-1-2-4)\n3-5: 3 (3-1-2-5)\n3-6: 1\n3-7: 1\n3-8: 2 (3-7-8)\n\n4-5: 2 (4-2-5)\n4-6: 4 (4-2-1-3-6)\n4-7: 4 (4-2-1-3-7)\n4-8: 5 (4-2-1-3-7-8)\n\n5-6: 4 (5-2-1-3-6)\n5-7: 4 (5-2-1-3-7)\n5-8: 5 (5-2-1-3-7-8)\n\n6-7: 2 (6-3-7)\n6-8: 3 (6-3-7-8)\n\n7-8: 1\n\nThe longest of these shortest paths is 5, which occurs between vertices 4-8, 2-8, and 5-8. Therefore, the diameter of this graph is 5."
