    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex problems. However, for the given function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5, we can find the minimum value using calculus instead of GWO.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function, we first find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x + 3 = 0\n2x = -3\nx = -3/2\n\nNow, we find the second derivative of the function to check if the point is a minimum:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, the point x = -3/2 is a minimum. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging this value of x back into the original function:\n\nf(-3/2) = (-3/2)^2 + 3(-3/2) + 5\nf(-3/2) = 9/4 - 9/2 + 5\nf(-3/2) = 9/4 - 18/4 + 20/4\nf(-3/2) = (9 - 18 + 20)/4\nf(-3/2) = 11/4\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5 is 11/4 or 2.75."
