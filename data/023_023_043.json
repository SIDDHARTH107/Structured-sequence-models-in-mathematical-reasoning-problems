    "message_1": "Suppose there is a communication network that sends signals at a frequency of 10 kHz, and the Fourier transform of the network's output signal has a magnitude of 5V at 10 kHz. If the input signal to the network has a magnitude of 2V at 10 kHz, what is the voltage gain of the network at that frequency?",
    "message_2": "The voltage gain of a network at a specific frequency can be calculated by dividing the output voltage by the input voltage at that frequency. In this case, the output voltage is 5V, and the input voltage is 2V at 10 kHz.\n\nVoltage gain = Output voltage / Input voltage\nVoltage gain = 5V / 2V\nVoltage gain = 2.5\n\nSo, the voltage gain of the network at 10 kHz is 2.5."
