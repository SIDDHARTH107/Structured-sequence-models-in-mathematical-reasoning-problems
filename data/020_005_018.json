    "message_1": "A bakery produces two types of cakes, chocolate and vanilla. The bakery has at most 100 pounds of flour, 80 pounds of sugar, and 60 pounds of cocoa powder. Each chocolate cake requires 2 pounds of flour, 1 pound of sugar, and 3 pounds of cocoa powder, while each vanilla cake requires 1 pound of flour, 2 pounds of sugar, and 1 pound of cocoa powder. The bakery earns a profit of $20 for each chocolate cake and $15 for each vanilla cake. How many of each type of cake should the bakery produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chocolate cakes and y be the number of vanilla cakes. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 15y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 100 (flour constraint)\n2. x + 2y ≤ 80 (sugar constraint)\n3. 3x + y ≤ 60 (cocoa powder constraint)\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ -2x + 100\n2. y ≤ -0.5x + 40\n3. y ≤ -3x + 60\n\nThe intersection points of these lines are:\n\nA. (0, 0) - intersection of constraints 1, 2, and 4\nB. (0, 40) - intersection of constraints 2 and 4\nC. (0, 60) - intersection of constraints 3 and 4\nD. (20, 20) - intersection of constraints 1 and 3\nE. (20, 0) - intersection of constraints 1 and 4\nF. (30, 0) - intersection of constraints 3 and 4\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these intersection points:\n\nP(A) = 20(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(B) = 20(0) + 15(40) = $600\nP(C) = 20(0) + 15(60) = $900\nP(D) = 20(20) + 15(20) = $700\nP(E) = 20(20) + 15(0) = $400\nP(F) = 20(30) + 15(0) = $600\n\nThe maximum profit is $900, which occurs when the bakery produces 0 chocolate cakes and 60 vanilla cakes."
