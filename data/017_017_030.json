    "message_1": "Consider a group G of order 30. Let H be a subgroup of G with order 5 and let K be a subgroup of G with order 3. Prove that H and K are normal subgroups of G, and that G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C30, D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30.",
    "message_2": "To prove that H and K are normal subgroups of G, we will use the fact that a subgroup of index 2 is always normal. Since |G| = 30, we have |G:H| = 30/5 = 6 and |G:K| = 30/3 = 10. Notice that 6 and 10 are both greater than 2, so we cannot directly conclude that H and K are normal subgroups of G using this fact.\n\nHowever, we can use the Sylow Theorems to help us. By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be H. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups divides 10 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are 1 or 10. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal in G, and we have shown that both H and K are normal subgroups of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible isomorphisms for G. If both H and K are normal in G, then we can form the direct product HK, which is a subgroup of G. Since |H| = 5 and |K| = 3, and 5 and 3 are coprime, we have |HK| = |H||K| = 15. By the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have G/HK ≅ (H × K)/(H ∩ K). Since H and K are both normal in G, their intersection H ∩ K is a normal subgroup of both H and K. However, since H and K have prime orders, their only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup and themselves. Since H ∩ K is a subgroup of both H and K, it must be the trivial subgroup. Thus, G/HK ≅ H × K, and |G/HK| = |H||K| = 15.\n\nNow, we have three possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30. This occurs when G is abelian, and H and K are both normal in G.\n\n2. G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15. This occurs when G is non-abelian, and H and K are both normal in G, but G is not a direct product of H and K.\n\n3. G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 30 that is not a direct product of H and K. This occurs when G is non-abelian, and H and K are both normal in G, but G is not a direct product of H and K, and G is not isomorphic to D15.\n\nIn conclusion, if H and K are normal subgroups of G, then G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C30, D15, or a non-abelian group of order 30."
