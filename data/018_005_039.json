    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as B or A', contains all the elements that are not in set A. Since set A contains the elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, set B contains all the other elements except these.\n\nThe intersection of set A and set B, denoted as A ∩ B, contains all the elements that are common to both sets. Since set B contains all the elements that are not in set A, there are no common elements between set A and set B.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and set B is an empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}."
