    "message_1": "Here's a specific problem related to using the Fourier transform to solve heat transfer problems:\n\nA thin, rectangular metal plate with dimensions 4 cm x 10 cm is initially at a uniform temperature of 20°C. At time t=0, one end of the plate is suddenly exposed to a heat source that raises the temperature to 100°C. Use the Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution in the plate at time t=0.5 seconds, assuming that the temperature at the exposed end of the plate remains at a constant value of 100°C. The thermal diffusivity of the metal plate is 0.01 cm^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the Fourier transform. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution in the plate, α is the thermal diffusivity, x is the position along the plate, and t is time.\n\nFirst, let's set up the boundary and initial conditions for this problem:\n\n1. T(x,0) = 20°C for 0 < x < 10 cm (initial temperature distribution)\n2. T(0,t) = 100°C for t > 0 (temperature at the exposed end)\n3. T(10,t) = 20°C for t > 0 (temperature at the other end)\n\nNow, we will apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation. We will use the Fourier sine transform since the boundary conditions are non-homogeneous. The Fourier sine transform of T(x,t) is given by:\n\nT_n(t) = 2/L ∫[0,L] T(x,t) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nwhere L is the length of the plate (10 cm) and n is an integer.\n\nApplying the Fourier sine transform to the heat equation, we get:\n\n∂T_n(t) / ∂t = -α (nπ/L)² T_n(t)\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in T_n(t). We can solve it using an integrating factor:\n\nT_n(t) = T_n(0) * exp(-α (nπ/L)² t)\n\nNow, we need to find T_n(0) by applying the Fourier sine transform to the initial condition T(x,0) = 20°C:\n\nT_n(0) = 2/L ∫[0,L] 20 * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nT_n(0) = (40/L) * (1 - (-1)^n) / (nπ)\n\nNow, we can find T_n(t) for t = 0.5 seconds:\n\nT_n(0.5) = T_n(0) * exp(-α (nπ/L)² * 0.5)\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution T(x,0.5) by applying the inverse Fourier sine transform:\n\nT(x,0.5) = Σ[1,∞] T_n(0.5) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nSince the series converges quickly, we can approximate the sum by taking the first few terms:\n\nT(x,0.5) ≈ T_1(0.5) * sin(πx/L) + T_3(0.5) * sin(3πx/L) + ...\n\nBy calculating the first few terms, we can find the temperature distribution in the plate at time t = 0.5 seconds. Note that this solution assumes that the temperature at the exposed end of the plate remains at a constant value of 100°C."
