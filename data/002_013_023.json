    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 cm * 4 cm * 3 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 72 cm³\n\nVolume = 24 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 24 cubic centimeters."
