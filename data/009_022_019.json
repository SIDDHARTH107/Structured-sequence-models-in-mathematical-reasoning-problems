The diffusion coefficient is 0.1 m²/s, and the coefficients for absorption and reaction are 0.001/s and 0.0001/m³s, respectively. \n\nWhat is the gas concentration after 1 hour at different points in the room (0.5m, 1m, and 2m) from one of the walls?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the given reaction-diffusion equation with the given initial conditions and parameters. The equation is a partial differential equation (PDE), and its solution can be quite involved. However, we can provide a general approach to solving this problem.\n\n1. Dimensionless form: First, we can non-dimensionalize the problem by introducing dimensionless variables. Let $x' = \\frac{x}{L_x}$, $y' = \\frac{y}{L_y}$, $z' = \\frac{z}{L_z}$, $t' = \\frac{t}{T}$, and $u' = \\frac{u}{U}$, where $L_x = 5$ m, $L_y = 5$ m, $L_z = 3$ m, $T$ is a characteristic time, and $U = 2$ ppm is the initial concentration. Substituting these variables into the PDE and choosing $T = \\frac{L_x^2}{D}$, we obtain a dimensionless form of the equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t'} = \\nabla'^2 u' - \\alpha u' + \\beta u'^2$\n\nwhere $\\alpha = \\frac{AL_x^2}{D}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{BL_x^2}{D}$ are dimensionless parameters.\n\n2. Initial and boundary conditions: The initial condition is $u'(x',y',z',0) = 1$. Since the room is a closed box, we can assume no-flux boundary conditions on the walls:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x'}(0,y',z',t') = \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x'}(1,y',z',t') = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial y'}(x',0,z',t') = \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial y'}(x',1,z',t') = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial z'}(x',y',0,t') = \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial z'}(x',y',1,t') = 0$\n\n3. Numerical solution: The dimensionless PDE can be solved numerically using finite difference or finite element methods. For example, we can discretize the spatial domain using a uniform grid and approximate the spatial derivatives using central differences. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be solved using an ODE solver, such as the forward Euler method or the Crank-Nicolson method.\n\n4. Gas concentration at different points: After obtaining the numerical solution $u'(x',y',z',t')$, we can find the gas concentration at different points in the room by converting back to dimensional variables:\n\n$u(x,y,z,t) = U u'(x',y',z',t')$\n\nFor example, to find the gas concentration after 1 hour at 0.5 m, 1 m, and 2 m from one of the walls, we can evaluate the solution at $t = 1$ hour, $x = 0.5$ m, $x = 1$ m, and $x = 2$ m, respectively:\n\n$u(0.5, y, z, 1 \\text{ hour}) = 2 \\text{ ppm} \\cdot u'(\\frac{0.5}{5}, y', z', \\frac{3600}{T})$\n\n$u(1, y, z, 1 \\text{ hour}) = 2 \\text{ ppm} \\cdot u'(\\frac{1}{5}, y', z', \\frac{3600}{T})$\n\n$u(2, y, z, 1 \\text{ hour}) = 2 \\text{ ppm} \\cdot u'(\\frac{2}{5}, y', z', \\frac{3600}{T})$\n\nIn summary, the gas concentration after 1 hour at different points in the room can be found by solving the dimensionless reaction-diffusion equation numerically and converting back to dimensional variables."
