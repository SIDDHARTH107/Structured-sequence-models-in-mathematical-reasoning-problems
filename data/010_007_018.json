    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of $X$ based at $x_0$, denoted by $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$, we will use the fact that the covering space of $X$ is $p: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow S^1$. \n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of a covering space. A covering space is a pair $(\\tilde{X}, p)$, where $\\tilde{X}$ is a topological space and $p: \\tilde{X} \\rightarrow X$ is a continuous map, such that for each point $x \\in X$, there exists an open neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $p^{-1}(U_x)$ is a disjoint union of open sets in $\\tilde{X}$, each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto $U_x$ by $p$.\n\nNow, let's consider the given covering map $p: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow S^1$ defined by $p(t) = e^{2\\pi i t}$. We can see that this map is continuous and satisfies the conditions of a covering space.\n\nTo compute the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$, we will use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: Let $p: \\tilde{X} \\rightarrow X$ be a covering map, and let $\\tilde{x_0} \\in \\tilde{X}$ be a point such that $p(\\tilde{x_0}) = x_0$. Then the homomorphism induced by $p$ on the fundamental groups, $p_*: \\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(X, x_0)$, is injective. Moreover, the image of $p_*$ is a subgroup of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$, and the index of this subgroup is equal to the number of sheets of the covering.\n\nIn our case, $\\tilde{X} = \\mathbb{R}$ and $X = S^1$. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is simply connected, its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}, \\tilde{x_0}) = \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. The covering map $p$ is a continuous map, and the number of sheets of the covering is 1, as each point in $S^1$ has exactly one preimage in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we have the induced homomorphism $p_*: \\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}, \\tilde{x_0}) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(S^1, x_0)$. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}, \\tilde{x_0})$ is trivial, the image of $p_*$ is also trivial, i.e., $p_*(\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}, \\tilde{x_0})) = \\{e\\}$. \n\nBy the theorem, the index of the image of $p_*$ in $\\pi_1(S^1, x_0)$ is equal to the number of sheets of the covering, which is 1. Therefore, $\\pi_1(S^1, x_0)$ is a group with a single element, the identity element $e$. This implies that $\\pi_1(S^1, x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, the group of integers under addition.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of $X$ based at $x_0$, denoted by $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$, is isomorphic to the group of integers under addition, i.e., $\\pi_1(X, x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
