    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nFor a prime number p, φ(p) = p - 1, since all numbers less than p are relatively prime to p. \n\nFor a number n that is a power of a prime, i.e., n = p^k for some prime p and positive integer k, we have φ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p).\n\nIn this case, 49 = 7^2, so we have:\n\nφ(49) = 49 * (1 - 1/7) = 49 * (6/7) = 42.\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 49 is 42."
