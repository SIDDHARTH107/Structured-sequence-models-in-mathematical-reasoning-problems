    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. In this case, we have three terms with the variable x and two constant terms.\n\n3x - 5x + 2x = (3 - 5 + 2)x = 0x\n\n7 - 9 = -2\n\nSo the simplified expression is:\n\n0x - 2\n\nSince 0x is equal to 0, the final simplified expression is:\n\n-2"
