In other words, it is the union of the two sets without their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} - {1, 3, 5} = {2, 4, 7}\n\nNow, to show that the symmetric difference is commutative, we need to prove that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection are commutative, we have:\n\nB ∪ A = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}\nB ∩ A = A ∩ B = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} - {1, 3, 5} = {2, 4, 7}\n\nAs we can see, A Δ B = {2, 4, 7} and B Δ A = {2, 4, 7}, which means A Δ B = B Δ A. Therefore, the symmetric difference is commutative."
