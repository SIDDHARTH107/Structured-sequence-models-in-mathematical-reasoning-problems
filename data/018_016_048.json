    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\n(B x A) ∪ (A x B) = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) ∪ (B x A) and (B x A) ∪ (A x B) are equal, which means that the union operation is commutative. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product operation is commutative. \n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is not commutative, we can simply observe that A x B and B x A are not equal:\n\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nSince A x B ≠ B x A, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
