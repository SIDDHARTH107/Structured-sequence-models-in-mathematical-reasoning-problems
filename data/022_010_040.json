    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series of the given function, we first need to rewrite the function in a more convenient form. We can factor the denominator as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2 + 6z + 8} = \\frac{1}{(z+2)(z+4)}$$\n\nNow, let's perform a partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{(z+2)(z+4)} = \\frac{A}{z+2} + \\frac{B}{z+4}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(z+2)(z+4)$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(z+4) + B(z+2)$$\n\nTo find the values of A and B, we can use the following system of equations:\n\n$$A+B=0$$\n$$4A+2B=1$$\n\nSolving this system, we find that $A=-1$ and $B=1$. So, we can rewrite the function as:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\frac{1}{z+2} + \\frac{1}{z+4}$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series for each term separately. Let's start with the first term:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{z+2} = -\\frac{1}{(z-(-2))}$$\n\nSince we want the Laurent series centered at $z=-2$, we can rewrite this term as:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{z+2} = -\\frac{1}{(z-(-2))} = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(z-(-2))^n}{2^{n+1}}$$\n\nNow, let's find the Laurent series for the second term:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z+4} = \\frac{1}{(z-(-2)+2)}$$\n\nWe can rewrite this term using the geometric series formula:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z+4} = \\frac{1}{(z-(-2)+2)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n(z-(-2))^n}{2^{n+1}}$$\n\nNow, we can combine both terms to get the Laurent series for the function:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(z-(-2))^n}{2^{n+1}} + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n(z-(-2))^n}{2^{n+1}}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n - 1}{2^{n+1}}(z+2)^n$$\n\nThis is the Laurent series of the function centered at $z=-2$.\n\nNow, let's determine the domain of convergence. The domain of convergence is the set of all complex numbers $z$ for which the Laurent series converges. Since the function has singularities at $z=-2$ and $z=-4$, the domain of convergence is the annulus between these two points:\n\n$$\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : -4 < |z+2| < 4\\}$$"
