    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a system of 3 linear equations with 3 unknowns as follows:\n\nx + y + z = 6 \n\n2x + 3y + 2z = 14 \n\n3x + 3y + 3z = 18\n\nHowever, the data is noisy, and there is some measurement error in the third equation. More specifically, the third equation is actually:\n\n3x + 3y + 3z = 17.5\n\nUse the method of least squares to find the best fit solution that minimizes the sum of the squared errors.",
    "message_2": "To use the method of least squares, we first need to rewrite the system of equations in matrix form. Let A be the matrix of coefficients, X be the column vector of unknowns (x, y, z), and B be the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |      X = | x |      B = |  6  |\n    | 2  3  2 |          | y |          | 14  |\n    | 3  3  3 |          | z |          | 17.5|\n\nNow, we can write the system of equations as AX = B. To find the best fit solution, we want to minimize the sum of the squared errors, which can be represented as ||AX - B||^2. To do this, we can use the normal equations: A^T * A * X = A^T * B.\n\nFirst, let's find A^T * A:\n\nA^T = | 1  2  3 |\n      | 1  3  3 |\n      | 1  2  3 |\n\nA^T * A = | 1+4+9   1+6+9   1+4+9  | = | 14  16  14 |\n          | 1+6+9   1+9+9   1+6+9  |   | 16  19  16 |\n          | 1+4+9   1+6+9   1+4+9  |   | 14  16  14 |\n\nNext, let's find A^T * B:\n\nA^T * B = | 1*6+2*14+3*17.5 | = |  82.5 |\n          | 1*6+3*14+3*17.5 |   |  96.5 |\n          | 1*6+2*14+3*17.5 |   |  82.5 |\n\nNow, we have the normal equations:\n\n| 14  16  14 | | x |   | 82.5 |\n| 16  19  16 | | y | = | 96.5 |\n| 14  16  14 | | z |   | 82.5 |\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using any method, such as Gaussian elimination, Cramer's rule, or matrix inversion. Using a calculator or software to solve this system, we get:\n\nx ≈ 1.5\ny ≈ 2.5\nz ≈ 2\n\nSo, the best fit solution that minimizes the sum of the squared errors is (x, y, z) ≈ (1.5, 2.5, 2)."
