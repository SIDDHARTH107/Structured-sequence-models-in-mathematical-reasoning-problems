    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector u onto vector v, we can use the formula:\n\nproj_v(u) = (u • v / ||v||^2) * v\n\nwhere \"•\" denotes the dot product, and ||v|| denotes the magnitude of vector v.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu • v = (3 * 5) + (-4 * 12) = 15 - 48 = -33\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector v:\n\n||v|| = √(5^2 + 12^2) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13\n\nNow, let's find the square of the magnitude of vector v:\n\n||v||^2 = 13^2 = 169\n\nNow we can find the projection of vector u onto vector v:\n\nproj_v(u) = (-33 / 169) * v = (-33 / 169) * ⟨5, 12⟩ = ⟨(-33/169) * 5, (-33/169) * 12⟩ = ⟨-165/169, -396/169⟩\n\nSo, the projection of vector u onto vector v is ⟨-165/169, -396/169⟩."
