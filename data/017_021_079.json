    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphism type of a given group of order 48, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups. Let G be a group of order 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 16 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow subgroups.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 16 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G, so G is a direct product of P_2 and P_3, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 is a cyclic group of order 16 and P_3 is a cyclic group of order 3, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C48.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, G acts on the set of left cosets of P_3 by left multiplication, which induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_3. The kernel of φ is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in P_2, and the image of φ is a subgroup of S_3 isomorphic to A_4 or S_3. By the second isomorphism theorem, G/ker(φ) ≅ Im(φ). If Im(φ) ≅ A_4, then G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4. If Im(φ) ≅ S_3, G is one of the non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4 or 16\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 16, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, G acts on the set of left cosets of P_2 by left multiplication, which induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_4 or S_{16}. The kernel of φ is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in P_3, and the image of φ is a subgroup of S_4 or S_{16}. By the second isomorphism theorem, G/ker(φ) ≅ Im(φ). In this case, G is one of the non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 48 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. To determine the isomorphism type of a given group of order 48, we need to analyze the structure of its Sylow subgroups and use the Sylow theorems and the second isomorphism theorem."
