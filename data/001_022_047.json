    "message_2": "To find the x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -3, b = 6, and c = -9. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = -6 / (2 * -3)\n\nx = -6 / -6\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the vertex is 1."
