    "message_2": "To find all distinct groups of order 10 up to isomorphism, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups is congruent to 1 mod p and divides the order of the group.\n\nSince 10 = 2 * 5, there are two Sylow subgroups: a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2 and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5.\n\nBy the second Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is that there is one Sylow 2-subgroup. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is that there is one Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, they are both normal. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 5-subgroup. Then the group G can be written as the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G = P x Q.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. P is cyclic of order 2 and Q is cyclic of order 5. In this case, G is the direct product of two cyclic groups, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 10, C10.\n\n2. P is the Klein four-group of order 2 and Q is the cyclic group of order 5. In this case, G is the direct product of the Klein four-group and a cyclic group, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 10, D5.\n\nHowever, since the order of P is 2, it cannot be the Klein four-group, so the second case is not possible.\n\nTherefore, there is only one distinct group of order 10 up to isomorphism, and it is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 10, C10."
