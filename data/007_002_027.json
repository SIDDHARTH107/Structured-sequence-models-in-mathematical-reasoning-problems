    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer greater than 100 that is divisible by 15, we can first divide 100 by 15 and round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n100 ÷ 15 ≈ 6.67\n\nRounding up, we get 7.\n\nNow, we multiply 7 by 15 to find the smallest positive integer greater than 100 that is divisible by 15.\n\n7 × 15 = 105\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer greater than 100 that is divisible by 15 is 105."
