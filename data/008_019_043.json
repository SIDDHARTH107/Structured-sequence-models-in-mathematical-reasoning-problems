    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and the third equation by -3, then add the two equations:\n\n(6x - 4y + 8z) + (-3x - 12y - 3z) = (-2 + 4i) + (-6 - 3i)\n\n3x - 16y + 5z = -8 + i\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3x-2y+4z &= -1+2i \\\\\n3x-16y+5z &= -8+i \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from the new system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(3x - 16y + 5z) - (3x - 2y + 4z) = (-8 + i) - (-1 + 2i)\n\n-14y + z = -7 - i\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x+5y-3z &= 4-3i \\\\\n-14y+z &= -7-i \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo eliminate y, we will multiply the first equation by 14 and the second equation by 5, then add the two equations:\n\n(28x + 70y - 42z) + (-70y + 5z) = (56 - 42i) + (-35 - 5i)\n\n28x - 37z = 21 - 47i\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n28x = 37z - 21 + 47i\n\nx = (37z - 21 + 47i) / 28\n\nNow we will substitute this expression for x back into the third equation of the original system:\n\n(37z - 21 + 47i) / 28 + 4y + z = 2 + i\n\nMultiplying both sides by 28 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n37z - 21 + 47i + 112y + 28z = 56 + 28i\n\nSimplifying:\n\n65z + 112y = 77 - 19i\n\nNow we will substitute the expression for x back into the first equation of the original system:\n\n3((37z - 21 + 47i) / 28) - 2y + 4z = -1 + 2i\n\nMultiplying both sides by 28 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3(37z - 21 + 47i) - 56y + 112z = -28 + 56i\n\nSimplifying:\n\n111z - 63 + 141i - 56y + 112z = -28 + 56i\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n223z - 56y = 35 + 197i\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n65z + 112y &= 77 - 19i \\\\\n223z - 56y &= 35 + 197i \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo eliminate y, we will multiply the first equation by 56 and the second equation by 112, then add the two equations:\n\n(3640z + 6272y) + (24984z - 6272y) = (4312 - 1064i) + (3920 + 22064i)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n28624z = 8232 + 20900i\n\nNow we can solve for z:\n\nz = (8232 + 20900i) / 28624\n\nz = (8232/28624) + (20900i/28624)\n\nz = 2/7 + (20900/28624)i\n\nz = 2/7 + (1045/14312)i\n\nNow we can substitute the value of z back into the equation 65z + 112y = 77 - 19i:\n\n65(2/7 + (1045/14312)i) + 112y = 77 - 19i\n\nSimplifying:\n\n130/7 + 67625/14312i + 112y = 77 - 19i\n\n112y = 77 - 130/7 - 19i - 67625/14312i\n\n112y = 9/7 - 19i - 67625/14312i\n\n112y = 9/7 - (19 + 67625/14312)i\n\nNow we can solve for y:\n\ny = (9/7) / 112 - (19 + 67625/14312)i / 112\n\ny = 1/14 - (19/112 + 1685/14312)i\n\ny = 1/14 - (1/7 + 1685/14312)i\n\nNow we have the values for x, y, and z:\n\nx = (37z - 21 + 47i) / 28 = (37(2/7 + (1045/14312)i) - 21 + 47i) / 28 = 1/2 + (3/4)i\n\ny = 1/14 - (1/7 + 1685/14312)i\n\nz = 2/7 + (1045/14312)i\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 1/2 + (3/4)i\ny = 1/14 - (1/7 + 1685/14312)i\nz = 2/7 + (1045/14312)i"
