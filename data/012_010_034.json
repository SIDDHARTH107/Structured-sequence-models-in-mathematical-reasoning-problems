    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible set of vertices that satisfies this condition.\n\nIn a graph with 8 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3, there are a total of (8 * 3) / 2 = 12 edges. This is because each edge is counted twice (once for each vertex it connects).\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum vertex cover. In the worst case, we would need to include every vertex in the cover. However, since each vertex has a degree of 3, we can be more efficient by including only one vertex from each edge in the cover.\n\nTo find the minimum size of the vertex cover, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. Pick a vertex with the highest degree (in this case, any vertex with degree 3).\n2. Add this vertex to the vertex cover.\n3. Remove all edges connected to this vertex from the graph.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all edges are covered.\n\nLet's apply this strategy:\n\n1. Pick a vertex with degree 3 and add it to the vertex cover.\n2. Remove all edges connected to this vertex. Now, the graph has 5 vertices with degree 3 and 2 vertices with degree 2.\n3. Pick another vertex with degree 3 and add it to the vertex cover.\n4. Remove all edges connected to this vertex. Now, the graph has 2 vertices with degree 3 and 3 vertices with degree 2.\n5. Pick another vertex with degree 3 and add it to the vertex cover.\n6. Remove all edges connected to this vertex. Now, the graph has no edges left.\n\nWe have added 3 vertices to the vertex cover, and all edges are covered. Therefore, the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph is 3."
