    "message_2": "The equation of the straight line is given in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 2x - 3, we can see that:\n\nm (slope) = 2\nb (y-intercept) = -3\n\nSo, the slope of the line is 2 and the y-intercept is -3."
