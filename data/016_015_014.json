    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The length of the Hilbert curve increases as the order increases. The length of the curve at each order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * a\n\nwhere n is the order of the curve, and a is the length of the initial segment.\n\nFor a 4th order Hilbert curve, n = 4. Assuming the length of the initial segment (a) is 1 unit:\n\nLength = (2^4 - 1) * 1\nLength = (16 - 1) * 1\nLength = 15 units\n\nSo, the length of the 4th order Hilbert curve is 15 units."
