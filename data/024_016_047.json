    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field T with respect to the vector field V, we use the following formula for covariant derivatives of tensor fields:\n\n(∇_V T)(X, Y) = V(T(X, Y)) - T(∇_V X, Y) - T(X, ∇_V Y)\n\nwhere X and Y are arbitrary vector fields on M. In our case, T = x^2 dy⊗dx + y^3 dx⊗dy and V = 2x∂/∂x + 3y∂/∂y. We will compute the covariant derivative at the point (1,1).\n\nFirst, let's compute the action of V on the components of T:\n\nV(x^2) = (2x∂/∂x + 3y∂/∂y)(x^2) = 2x(2x) + 3y(0) = 4x^2\nV(y^3) = (2x∂/∂x + 3y∂/∂y)(y^3) = 2x(0) + 3y(3y^2) = 9y^3\n\nNow, let's compute the action of ∇_V on the basis vector fields:\n\n∇_V(∂/∂x) = 0, since the manifold is flat and has no connection coefficients.\n∇_V(∂/∂y) = 0, for the same reason.\n\nNow we can compute the covariant derivative of T with respect to V:\n\n(∇_V T)(X, Y) = V(T(X, Y)) - T(∇_V X, Y) - T(X, ∇_V Y)\n= V(x^2) dy⊗dx(X, Y) + V(y^3) dx⊗dy(X, Y)\n= 4x^2 dy⊗dx(X, Y) + 9y^3 dx⊗dy(X, Y)\n\nFinally, we evaluate the expression at the point (1,1):\n\n(∇_V T)(X, Y) = 4(1)^2 dy⊗dx(X, Y) + 9(1)^3 dx⊗dy(X, Y)\n= 4 dy⊗dx(X, Y) + 9 dx⊗dy(X, Y)\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of T with respect to V at the point (1,1) is:\n\n∇_V T = 4 dy⊗dx + 9 dx⊗dy"
