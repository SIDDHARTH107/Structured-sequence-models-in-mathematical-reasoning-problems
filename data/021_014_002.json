    "message_2": "To solve this problem using genetic algorithms, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual\n3. Select parents\n4. Perform crossover and mutation\n5. Evaluate the new population\n6. Replace the old population with the new one\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the termination criterion is met\n\nStep 1: Initialize the population\nWe will generate 10 random values of x within a reasonable range, say -10 to 10.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the fitness of each individual\nWe will calculate the value of f(x) for each individual and use it as their fitness score. Since we are looking for the maximum value, higher fitness scores are better.\n\nStep 3: Select parents\nWe will select pairs of parents using the roulette wheel selection method, where individuals with higher fitness scores have a higher chance of being selected.\n\nStep 4: Perform crossover and mutation\nWe will perform single-point crossover on the selected parents to create offspring. Then, with a mutation rate of 0.1, we will randomly mutate some of the offspring by adding a small random value to their x-coordinate.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the new population\nWe will calculate the fitness scores of the offspring and combine them with the fitness scores of the parents.\n\nStep 6: Replace the old population with the new one\nWe will select the top 10 individuals with the highest fitness scores to form the new population.\n\nStep 7: Repeat steps 3-6 until the termination criterion is met\nWe will repeat the process for 50 generations.\n\nAfter 50 generations, we will have a population that has converged towards the maximum value of the function. We can then calculate the value of f(x) for the best individual in the final population to find the maximum value of the function.\n\nNote: Since this is a genetic algorithm, the solution may not be exact, but it should be close to the true maximum value. The true maximum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 can be found using calculus by taking the derivative and setting it to zero: f'(x) = 2x - 2 = 0, which gives x = 1. The maximum value is f(1) = 1^2 - 2(1) + 3 = 2."
