    "message_2": "To solve the equation log₃(x-2) - log₃(x+1) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the quotient rule, which states that log₃(a) - log₃(b) = log₃(a/b). Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n\nlog₃((x-2)/(x+1)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log₃(a) = b, then a = 3^b. Applying this to our equation, we get:\n\n(x-2)/(x+1) = 3^2\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\n(x-2)/(x+1) = 9\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\n(x-2) = 9(x+1)\n\nExpand the equation:\n\nx - 2 = 9x + 9\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n-2 = 8x + 9\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n-11 = 8x\n\nNow, divide by 8:\n\nx = -11/8\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\nx = -11/8"
