    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  5 |\n    | 4  2  3 |\n    | 6  5  7 |\n\nb = | 7  |\n    | 8  |\n    | 12 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A, where Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is an upper triangular matrix.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = a1 = (2, 4, 6)\ne1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (1/7, 2/7, 3/7)\n\nu2 = a2 - proj(a2, e1) = (3, 2, 5) - ((3, 2, 5) · e1) * e1\nu2 = (3, 2, 5) - (29/7) * (1/7, 2/7, 3/7) = (8/7, -6/7, 4/7)\ne2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (2/3, -1/3, 1/3)\n\nu3 = a3 - proj(a3, e1) - proj(a3, e2) = (5, 3, 7) - ((5, 3, 7) · e1) * e1 - ((5, 3, 7) · e2) * e2\nu3 = (5, 3, 7) - (56/7) * (1/7, 2/7, 3/7) - (2/3) * (2/3, -1/3, 1/3) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSince u3 is a zero vector, the third column of A is linearly dependent on the first two columns. Therefore, the system of linear equations is not uniquely solvable. However, we can still find a least-squares solution.\n\nThe orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R are:\n\nQ = | 1/7  2/3 |\n    | 2/7 -1/3 |\n    | 3/7  1/3 |\n\nR = | 7  29/7 |\n    | 0   2/3 |\n\nNow, we solve the system Rx = Q^T * b:\n\nQ^T * b = | 1/7  2/7  3/7 |  | 7  | = | 29/7 |\n          | 2/3 -1/3  1/3 |  | 8  |   |  2/3 |\n                            | 12 |\n\nNow, we solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^T * b:\n\n7x + 29/7y = 29/7\n2/3y = 2/3\n\nFrom the second equation, we get y = 1. Now, we substitute y back into the first equation:\n\n7x + 29/7 = 29/7\n7x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSince the third column of A is linearly dependent on the first two columns, we can express z as a linear combination of x and y:\n\nz = c1 * x + c2 * y\n\nWe can find the least-squares solution by setting z = 0:\n\nx = 0\ny = 1\nz = 0\n\nSo, the least-squares solution for the given system of linear equations is (0, 1, 0)."
