    "message_2": "To find a biholomorphic function $f: D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{D}$ such that $f(\\alpha) = 0$ and $f(\\beta) = 1$, we can use the Riemann Mapping Theorem and Möbius transformations.\n\nFirst, let's find a biholomorphic function $g: D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{D}$ such that $g(\\alpha) = 0$. By the Riemann Mapping Theorem, there exists a biholomorphic function $g$ from $D$ to the open unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ with $g(\\alpha) = 0$. \n\nNow, we want to find a Möbius transformation $h: \\mathbb{D} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{D}$ such that $h(g(\\beta)) = 1$. A Möbius transformation is given by the formula:\n\n$$h(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. Since $h$ maps the unit disk to itself, we have $|h(z)| < 1$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$. \n\nWe want $h(g(\\beta)) = 1$. Let $w = g(\\beta)$. Then, we have:\n\n$$h(w) = \\frac{aw + b}{cw + d} = 1$$\n\nWe can choose $a = d = 1$ and $b = 0$ to simplify the expression:\n\n$$h(w) = \\frac{w}{cw + 1} = 1$$\n\nSolving for $c$, we get:\n\n$$c = \\frac{w - 1}{w}$$\n\nNow, we have the Möbius transformation $h(z) = \\frac{z}{(\\frac{w - 1}{w})z + 1}$. Since Möbius transformations are biholomorphic, the composition $f = h \\circ g$ is also biholomorphic. Moreover, we have:\n\n$$f(\\alpha) = h(g(\\alpha)) = h(0) = 0$$\n\nand\n\n$$f(\\beta) = h(g(\\beta)) = h(w) = 1$$\n\nThus, we have found a biholomorphic function $f: D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{D}$ such that $f(\\alpha) = 0$ and $f(\\beta) = 1$."
