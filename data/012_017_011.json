    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges in a graph such that every vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, a perfect matching is a set of disjoint edges that cover all vertices in the graph.\n\nFor a graph G with 6 vertices to have a perfect matching, it must satisfy the Tutte-Berge formula:\n\nmin(deg(u) + deg(v) - k) ≥ k - 1 for all subsets U of the vertices of G\n\nwhere deg(u) and deg(v) are the degrees of vertices u and v, and k is the size of the subset U.\n\nSince G has 9 edges, the minimum degree of any vertex in G is at least 3 (by the Pigeonhole Principle). Let's consider a subset U of size 2 (k = 2). The minimum degree sum for any two vertices in G is 6 (deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ 6). Therefore, the Tutte-Berge formula is satisfied:\n\nmin(6 - 2) ≥ 2 - 1\n4 ≥ 1\n\nSince the Tutte-Berge formula is satisfied for all subsets U of the vertices of G, G has a perfect matching.\n\nHere's an example of a graph G with 6 vertices and 9 edges that has a perfect matching:\n\nVertices: {A, B, C, D, E, F}\nEdges: {AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DF}\n\nA perfect matching for this graph is {AB, CD, EF}. Each vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex."
