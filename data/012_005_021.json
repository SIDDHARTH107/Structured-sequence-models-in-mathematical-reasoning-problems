    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. To find the diameter, we need to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices and then find the longest of these paths.\n\nHere are the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices:\n\n1-8: 1-2-4-8 (length 3)\n1-7: 1-3-7 (length 2)\n1-6: 1-3-6 (length 2)\n1-5: 1-2-5 (length 2)\n1-4: 1-2-4 (length 2)\n1-3: 1-3 (length 1)\n1-2: 1-2 (length 1)\n\n2-8: 2-4-8 (length 2)\n2-7: 2-1-3-7 (length 3)\n2-6: 2-1-3-6 (length 3)\n2-5: 2-5 (length 1)\n2-4: 2-4 (length 1)\n2-3: 2-1-3 (length 2)\n\n3-8: 3-7-8 (length 2)\n3-7: 3-7 (length 1)\n3-6: 3-6 (length 1)\n3-5: 3-1-2-5 (length 3)\n3-4: 3-1-2-4 (length 3)\n\n4-8: 4-8 (length 1)\n4-7: 4-8-7 (length 2)\n4-6: 4-1-3-6 (length 3)\n4-5: 4-2-5 (length 2)\n\n5-8: 5-8 (length 1)\n5-7: 5-8-7 (length 2)\n5-6: 5-1-3-6 (length 3)\n\n6-8: 6-7-8 (length 2)\n6-7: 6-7 (length 1)\n\n7-8: 7-8 (length 1)\n\nNow, we look for the longest of these shortest paths.
