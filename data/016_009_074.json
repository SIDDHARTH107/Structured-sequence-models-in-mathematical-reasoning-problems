    "message_2": "A dragon curve is a fractal pattern created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The order of a dragon curve refers to the number of times the paper is folded.\n\nFor each order, the total length of the dragon curve is doubled. So, for an order 10 dragon curve, the length will be doubled 10 times.\n\nStarting with a length of 1 unit, we can calculate the total length as follows:\n\n1 * 2^10 = 1 * 1024 = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of a dragon curve of order 10 with a starting line segment of 1 unit is 1024 units."
