    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the curve $C$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$ and $y$. Let $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x^2 + 4x$. Then $C$ is defined by the equation $F(x, y) = 0$. \n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 2x + 4$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of $C$ is given by:\n\n$J(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -3x^2 - 2x + 4 & 2y \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSo, the Jacobian of the curve $C$ is:\n\n$J(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} -3x^2 - 2x + 4 & 2y \\end{bmatrix}$"
