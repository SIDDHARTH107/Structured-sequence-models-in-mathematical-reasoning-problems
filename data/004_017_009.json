    "message_1": "Consider the curve given by the equation y = x^(3/2)/3 on the interval [0, 4]. Find the arc length of the curve over this interval accurate to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)/3\ndy/dx = (3/2)(x^(1/2))/3 = x^(1/2)/2\n\nNow, we need to find (dy/dx)^2:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = (x^(1/2)/2)^2 = x/4\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + x/4) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution:\n\nLet u = 1 + x/4\nThen, du/dx = 1/4\nSo, dx = 4 du\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 2] √(u) * 4 du = 4 ∫[1, 2] u^(1/2) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n4 ∫[1, 2] u^(1/2) du = 4 * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 2]\n= (8/3) * (2^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nNow, we can evaluate the expression:\n\nL = (8/3) * (2^(3/2) - 1)\n≈ (8/3) * (2.828 - 1)\n≈ (8/3) * 1.828\n≈ 4.88\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve over the interval [0, 4] is approximately 4.88 (accurate to two decimal places)."
