    "message_2": "To find the total Gaussian curvature of S, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature K at any point on the surface S. Then, we will integrate K over the surface S.\n\nThe Gaussian curvature K of a sphere with radius r is given by K = 1/r^2. In this case, the sphere has radius 1, so K = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the surface S. To do this, we will use the spherical coordinates (ρ, θ, φ), where ρ is the radial distance, θ is the polar angle (0 ≤ θ ≤ π), and φ is the azimuthal angle (0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π).\n\nThe sphere equation in spherical coordinates is ρ = 1. The planes z = -1/√2 and z = 1/√2 can be written in spherical coordinates as:\n\nz = ρ * cos(θ) = -1/√2 and z = ρ * cos(θ) = 1/√2\n\nSince ρ = 1, we have:\n\ncos(θ) = -1/√2 and cos(θ) = 1/√2\n\nSolving for θ, we get:\n\nθ = π/4 and θ = 3π/4\n\nNow, we can find the area of the surface S by integrating the area element dA = ρ^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ over the region defined by the planes. The limits of integration for θ are π/4 and 3π/4, and for φ, they are 0 and 2π:\n\nArea(S) = ∫∫_S dA = ∫(π/4 to 3π/4) ∫(0 to 2π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nLet's first integrate with respect to θ:\n\n∫(π/4 to 3π/4) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](π/4 to 3π/4) = (-cos(3π/4) + cos(π/4)) = (1/√2 + 1/√2) = 2/√2 = √2\n\nNow, let's integrate with respect to φ:\n\n∫(0 to 2π) √2 dφ = √2 * [φ](0 to 2π) = √2 * (2π) = 2π√2\n\nSo, the area of the surface S is 2π√2.\n\nFinally, we can find the total Gaussian curvature of S by multiplying the Gaussian curvature K by the area of S:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = K * Area(S) = 1 * 2π√2 = 2π√2"
