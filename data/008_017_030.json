    "message_2": "The method of sparse matrices is not applicable to this problem, as it is a technique used for solving large systems of linear equations with many zero coefficients. This system has no zero coefficients. Instead, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nFirst, we can write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 16 |\n| 5  6  7 | 37 |\n| 8  9 10 | 58 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first variable (x) from the second and third equations.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the first row by -2.5 and add it to the second row:\n\n| 2   3   4  |  16  |\n| 0  -1.5 -3 | -3  |\n| 8   9  10  |  58  |\n\nNext, multiply the first row by -4 and add it to the third row:\n\n|  2   3    4  |  16  |\n|  0  -1.5 -3  |  -3  |\n|  0  -3   -6  | -6   |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second variable (y) from the third equation.\n\nTo do this, multiply the second row by 2 and add it to the third row:\n\n|  2   3    4  |  16  |\n|  0  -1.5 -3  |  -3  |\n|  0   0    0  |  0   |\n\nAt this point, we have a row of all zeros, which means the system has infinitely many solutions. However, we can still find the relationship between the variables.\n\nFrom the second row, we have -1.5y - 3z = -3. Divide by -1.5 to get:\n\ny + 2z = 2\n\nNow, we can express y in terms of z:\n\ny = 2 - 2z\n\nSubstitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(2 - 2z) + 4z = 16\n\nSimplify and solve for x:\n\n2x + 6 - 6z + 4z = 16\n2x - 2z = 10\nx - z = 5\n\nNow, we can express x in terms of z:\n\nx = 5 + z\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is given by the parametric equations:\n\nx = 5 + z\ny = 2 - 2z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
