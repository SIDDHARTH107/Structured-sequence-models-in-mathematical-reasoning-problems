    "message_1": "A company hires a manager to oversee a project. The manager can choose to put in high effort (E = 10) or low effort (E = 6). If the manager chooses high effort, there is a 60% chance that the project will succeed, earning the company a profit of $100. If the manager chooses low effort, there is a 30% chance that the project will succeed, earning the company a profit of $50. However, the manager is risk-averse and values high effort at $8 and low effort at $4 more than the corresponding payoffs due to the effort required. What effort level will the manager choose and what is the expected profit for the company?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effort level the manager will choose, we need to calculate the expected utility for both high effort and low effort choices, taking into account the manager's risk aversion.\n\nExpected utility for high effort (EU_high):\nEU_high = (probability of success * (profit - cost of effort)) + (probability of failure * (0 - cost of effort))\nEU_high = (0.6 * (100 - 8)) + (0.4 * (0 - 8))\nEU_high = (0.6 * 92) + (0.4 * -8)\nEU_high = 55.2 - 3.2\nEU_high = 52\n\nExpected utility for low effort (EU_low):\nEU_low = (probability of success * (profit - cost of effort)) + (probability of failure * (0 - cost of effort))\nEU_low = (0.3 * (50 - 4)) + (0.7 * (0 - 4))\nEU_low = (0.3 * 46) + (0.7 * -4)\nEU_low = 13.8 - 2.8\nEU_low = 11\n\nSince the expected utility for high effort (52) is greater than the expected utility for low effort (11), the manager will choose to put in high effort.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for the company:\n\nExpected profit for high effort (EP_high):\nEP_high = (probability of success * profit) + (probability of failure * 0)\nEP_high = (0.6 * 100) + (0.4 * 0)\nEP_high = 60\n\nTherefore, the manager will choose to put in high effort, and the expected profit for the company is $60."
