Find the first non-vanishing Floer homology group with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ associated to a specific spin$^c$ structure over the two-holed torus.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology group, we first need to consider a specific spin$^c$ structure on the two-holed torus. Let's denote the two-holed torus by $T$. A spin$^c$ structure on $T$ can be represented by a pair of integers $(k_1, k_2)$, where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the degrees of the line bundles associated with the two generators of the first homology group of $T$. \n\nNow, let's consider the Heegaard Floer homology, which is a version of Floer homology for 3-manifolds. The Heegaard Floer homology of a 3-manifold $Y$ can be computed using a Heegaard diagram for $Y$. A Heegaard diagram for the two-holed torus $T$ can be obtained by taking a genus 2 handlebody and attaching two 1-handles to it. \n\nLet's denote the Heegaard Floer homology of $T$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ by $\\widehat{HF}(T, \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$. The Heegaard Floer homology of $T$ is a direct sum of the Heegaard Floer homology groups associated with the different spin$^c$ structures on $T$. In other words, we have:\n\n$$\\widehat{HF}(T, \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{(k_1, k_2)} \\widehat{HF}(T, (k_1, k_2), \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}).$$\n\nNow, we want to find the first non-vanishing Floer homology group associated with a specific spin$^c$ structure. Since the two-holed torus has genus 2, there are four spin$^c$ structures, corresponding to the pairs $(k_1, k_2) = (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0),$ and $(1, 1)$. \n\nIt is known that for a closed, connected surface of genus $g$, the Heegaard Floer homology groups associated with the spin$^c$ structures $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$ are isomorphic, and the Heegaard Floer homology groups associated with the spin$^c$ structures $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$ are isomorphic. Moreover, the Heegaard Floer homology groups associated with the spin$^c$ structures $(0, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ are non-vanishing. \n\nTherefore, the first non-vanishing Floer homology group with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ associated with a specific spin$^c$ structure over the two-holed torus is given by:\n\n$$\\widehat{HF}(T, (0, 0), \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\widehat{HF}(T, (1, 1), \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\neq 0.$$"
