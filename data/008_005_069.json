    "message_1": "Given the system of equations:\n```\n2x + y - z = 7\nx - y + 3z = 5\n4x - 5y + 10z = 19\n```\nSolve for the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate `y` from the first and second equations. To do this, we will add the first and second equations:\n\n(2x + y - z) + (x - y + 3z) = 7 + 5\n3x + 2z = 12\n\nNow, let's eliminate `y` from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by 5 and add it to the third equation:\n\n5(x - y + 3z) + (4x - 5y + 10z) = 5 * 5 + 19\n5x - 5y + 15z + 4x - 5y + 10z = 25 + 19\n9x - 10y + 25z = 44\n\nNow we have two new equations with only `x` and `z`:\n\n3x + 2z = 12\n9x - 10y + 25z = 44\n\nLet's eliminate `x` from these two new equations. To do this, we will multiply the first new equation by 3 and subtract it from the second new equation:\n\n(9x - 10y + 25z) - 3(3x + 2z) = 44 - 3 * 12\n9x - 10y + 25z - 9x - 6z = 44 - 36\n-10y + 19z = 8\n\nNow we have an equation with only `y` and `z`. Let's substitute this equation into the second original equation to find the value of `z`:\n\nx - y + 3z = 5\nx - (-10y + 19z) + 3z = 5\nx + 10y - 19z + 3z = 5\nx + 10y - 16z = 5\n\nNow we have an equation with `x`, `y`, and `z`. Let's substitute the value of `y` from the equation we found earlier:\n\nx + 10(-10y + 19z) - 16z = 5\nx - 100y + 190z - 16z = 5\nx - 100y + 174z = 5\n\nNow we have an equation with only `x` and `z`. Let's substitute this equation into the first original equation to find the value of `x`:\n\n2x + y - z = 7\n2(x - 100y + 174z) + y - z = 7\n2x - 200y + 348z + y - z = 7\n2x - 199y + 347z = 7\n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three variables:\n\n-10y + 19z = 8\nx + 10y - 16z = 5\n2x - 199y + 347z = 7\n\nLet's solve this system using a matrix method or a calculator. The solution is:\n\nx = 3\ny = 1\nz = 2"
