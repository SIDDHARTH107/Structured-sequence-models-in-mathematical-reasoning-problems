    "message_1": "If Alice and Bob agreed to use a prime number p = 19 and a primitive root g = 2 for their Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and Alice's secret key is a = 7 while Bob's secret key is b = 13, what will be the shared secret key they will use to encrypt their messages?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret key, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret key.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as S_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as S_B = A^b mod p.\n5. If the protocol is executed correctly, S_A and S_B should be equal, and this value is the shared secret key.\n\nLet's compute the shared secret key using the given values:\n\n1. A = 2^7 mod 19 = 128 mod 19 = 11\n2. B = 2^13 mod 19 = 8192 mod 19 = 12\n3. S_A = 12^7 mod 19 = 35831808 mod 19 = 10\n4. S_B = 11^13 mod 19 = 34522712161121 mod 19 = 10\n\nSince S_A and S_B are equal, the shared secret key is 10. Alice and Bob will use this key to encrypt their messages."
