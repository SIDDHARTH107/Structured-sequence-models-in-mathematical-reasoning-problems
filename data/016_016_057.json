    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is constructed by iteratively replacing each line segment with a sequence of smaller segments. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength of curve after n iterations = (initial length) * (multiplier)^n\n\nThe multiplier for the Gosper curve is (7/3), as each line segment is replaced by 7 segments, each of which is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nGiven that the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, we can calculate the length of the 4th iteration of the Gosper curve as follows:\n\nLength of curve after 4 iterations = 1 * (7/3)^4\nLength of curve after 4 iterations = 1 * (2401/81)\nLength of curve after 4 iterations â‰ˆ 29.64198 units\n\nSo, the length of the 4th iteration of the Gosper curve is approximately 29.64198 units."
