    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of G, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices and m edges has treewidth at most t if and only if it has a vertex of degree at most t+1.\n\nFirst, let's find the average degree of the graph G. Since G has 12 vertices and 20 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 20 = 40. Therefore, the average degree of G is 40 / 12 â‰ˆ 3.33.\n\nSince the average degree is between 3 and 4, there must be at least one vertex with degree at most 3. This means that the treewidth of G is at most 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nNow, let's try to find a tree decomposition of G with width 2. Since G is connected and has 12 vertices, it must have at least 11 edges. If G has a tree decomposition with width 2, then it can be decomposed into subgraphs, each with at most 3 vertices. The maximum number of edges in a subgraph with 3 vertices is 3, so the total number of edges in G would be at most 3 * (12 - 1) = 33.\n\nSince G has only 20 edges, which is less than 33, it is possible to find a tree decomposition of G with width 2. Therefore, the treewidth of G is 2."
