    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to C20, D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 20 = 2^2 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 5. Similarly, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases for n_2:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P of order 4. Since n_5 = 1, there is also a unique 5-Sylow subgroup Q of order 5. Both P and Q are normal in G because they are unique (by the Sylow theorems). Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the internal direct product of P and Q, which is a cyclic group of order 20, i.e., G ≅ C20.\n\n2. If n_2 = 5, then there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4. Since n_5 = 1, there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup Q of order 5, which is normal in G. Let P be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}. We can form the semidirect product of P and Q, denoted by P ⋊ Q. The group G is isomorphic to this semidirect product.\n\nNow, we need to determine if G is isomorphic to D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20. To do this, we will analyze the action of Q on P by conjugation. Since Q is normal in G, the action of Q on P is well-defined. Let q ∈ Q and p ∈ P. Then, the action of q on p is given by q * p * q^(-1). Since Q has order 5, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z5, and P has order 4, so it is isomorphic to either Z4 or Z2 × Z2.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z4, then there exists an element in Q that acts non-trivially on P, and the semidirect product P ⋊ Q will be non-abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z2 × Z2, then the action of Q on P will be trivial, and the semidirect product P ⋊ Q will be isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, which is isomorphic to D10. In this case, G is isomorphic to D10.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to C20, D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20, depending on the structure of the 2-Sylow subgroups and the action of the 5-Sylow subgroup on them. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the specific group G."
