    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection, we will substitute the equation of the line $y = x - 3$ into the equation of the curve $y^2 = x^3 - 6x + 9$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$(x-3)^2 = x^3 - 6x + 9$\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n$x^2 - 6x + 9 = x^3 - 6x + 9$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\n$x^3 - x^2 = 0$\n\nFactor out an x:\n\n$x(x^2 - 1) = 0$\n\nNow, we have two factors: $x = 0$ and $x^2 - 1 = 0$. \n\nFor the first factor, $x = 0$, we can substitute it back into the line equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\n$y = 0 - 3 = -3$\n\nSo, the first point of intersection is $(0, -3)$.\n\nFor the second factor, $x^2 - 1 = 0$, we can solve for x:\n\n$x^2 = 1$\n\n$x = \\pm 1$\n\nFor $x = 1$, substitute it back into the line equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\n$y = 1 - 3 = -2$\n\nSo, the second point of intersection is $(1, -2)$.\n\nFor $x = -1$, substitute it back into the line equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\n$y = -1 - 3 = -4$\n\nSo, the third point of intersection is $(-1, -4)$.\n\nTherefore, the points of intersection of the curve $y^2 = x^3 - 6x + 9$ and the line $y = x - 3$ are $(0, -3)$, $(1, -2)$, and $(-1, -4)$."
