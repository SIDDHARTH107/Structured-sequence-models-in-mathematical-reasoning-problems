    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible that every pair of people in a group of 6 people are either friends or enemies. In this scenario, there are a total of C(6,2) = 15 pairs of people, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. \n\nFor each of these 15 pairs, they can either be friends or enemies. There are no restrictions on the number of friends or enemies each person can have, so it is possible for every pair to have a defined relationship as either friends or enemies."
