    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the properties of subtraction and addition of logarithms:\n\nlogₐ(x) - logₐ(y) = logₐ(x/y)\nlogₐ(x) + logₐ(y) = logₐ(xy)\n\nApplying these properties to the given expression:\n\nlog₃ 243 - log₃ 9 + log₃ 27 = log₃(243/9) + log₃ 27 = log₃(27) + log₃ 27\n\nNow, we can use the property of addition of logarithms again:\n\nlog₃(27) + log₃(27) = log₃(27 * 27) = log₃(729)\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent to which 3 must be raised to get 729:\n\n3^x = 729\n\n3^x = 3^6 (since 3^6 = 729)\n\nSo, x = 6.\n\nTherefore, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\nlog₃ 729 = 6"
