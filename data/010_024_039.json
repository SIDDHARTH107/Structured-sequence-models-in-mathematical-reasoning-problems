    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, the angles are 50°, 60°, and 70°. First, we need to convert these angles to radians:\n\nα = 50° × (π/180) ≈ 0.8727 radians\nβ = 60° × (π/180) ≈ 1.0472 radians\nγ = 70° × (π/180) ≈ 1.2217 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = π - (0.8727 + 1.0472 + 1.2217)\nArea ≈ π - 3.1416\n\nArea ≈ -0.0000 (approximately)\n\nThe area of the hyperbolic triangle is approximately 0. This is because the sum of the angles in a hyperbolic triangle is always less than π, and in this case, the sum of the angles is very close to π."
