    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in Solving optimization problems using Whale Optimization Algorithm subtopic of Numerical analysis:\n \nAn engineering company wants to optimize the design of a steel beam to support a maximum load of 50 kN. The beam will be made of mild steel with a yield stress of 250 MPa. The allowable bending stress in the beam is 120 MPa. Using the whale optimization algorithm, determine the minimum radius of the beam that will satisfy the strength requirements. Assume that the beam has a circular cross-section.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and the algorithm's parameters. \n\nObjective function: The objective is to minimize the radius (r) of the circular cross-section of the beam. \n\nConstraints: The allowable bending stress in the beam is 120 MPa, and the maximum load is 50 kN.\n\n1. Bending stress (σ) = (M * c) / I, where M is the moment, c is the distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber, and I is the moment of inertia.\n2. Moment of inertia (I) for a circular cross-section = (pi * r^4) / 4\n3. Maximum moment (M) = Load * Length / 4 (assuming a simply supported beam with a point load at the center)\n4. The distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber (c) = r\n\nWe need to ensure that the bending stress (σ) does not exceed the allowable bending stress (120 MPa).\n\nAlgorithm parameters: The WOA parameters include the number of whales (population size), the maximum number of iterations, and the b parameter (which controls the logarithmic spiral's shape).\n\nNow, let's implement the WOA to find the minimum radius of the beam.\n\n1. Initialize the whale population with random positions within the search space (possible radius values).\n2. Evaluate the objective function for each whale.\n3. Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations.\n4. Check if the new positions satisfy the constraints (bending stress <= 120 MPa).\n5. Update the best solution if a better one is found.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter the algorithm converges, the best solution found will be the minimum radius of the beam that satisfies the strength requirements.\n\nNote: The actual implementation of the Whale Optimization Algorithm requires programming knowledge and the use of a suitable programming language or software. The explanation provided here is a high-level overview of the process to solve the given problem using the WOA."
