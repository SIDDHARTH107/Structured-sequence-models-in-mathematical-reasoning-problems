    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of the graph G, we need to find the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's use the fact that the graph has 9 vertices and 18 edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with n vertices is given by the formula:\n\nmax_edges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nFor n = 9, the maximum number of edges is:\n\nmax_edges = 9 * (9 - 1) / 2 = 9 * 8 / 2 = 36\n\nSince the graph has 18 edges, which is half of the maximum possible edges for a graph with 9 vertices, it is not a complete graph. Therefore, the chromatic number will be less than 9.\n\nNow let's use the chromatic number's relationship with the maximum degree of the graph, denoted as Δ(G). The chromatic number χ(G) is always greater than or equal to Δ(G) and less than or equal to Δ(G) + 1.\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nTo find the maximum degree, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) = 2 * |E|\n\nSince the graph has 9 vertices and 18 edges, the average degree of a vertex is:\n\naverage_degree = (2 * 18) / 9 = 4\n\nSince the average degree is 4, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) is at least 4.\n\nNow we can use the inequality:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\n4 ≤ χ(G) ≤ 5\n\nSince the chromatic number is an integer, the possible values for χ(G) are 4 or 5. Without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact chromatic number. However, we can conclude that the chromatic number of this graph is either 4 or 5."
