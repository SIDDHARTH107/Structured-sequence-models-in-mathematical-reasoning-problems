    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 2(x + 2y - z) = 2(6)\n(2) 1(2x - 3y + 4z) = 1(-7)\n\nNow we have:\n\n(1) 2x + 4y - 2z = 12\n(2) 2x - 3y + 4z = -7\n\nNext, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (2): (2x + 4y - 2z) - (2x - 3y + 4z) = 12 - (-7)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n7y - 6z = 19\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by 2:\n\n(1) 3(x + 2y - z) = 3(6)\n(3) 2(3x + y + 2iz) = 2(4)\n\nNow we have:\n\n(1) 3x + 6y - 3z = 18\n(3) 6x + 2y + 4iz = 8\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (3):\n\n(3) - (1): (6x + 2y + 4iz) - (3x + 6y - 3z) = 8 - 18\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x - 4y + 4iz + 3z = -10\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n7y - 6z = 19\n3x - 4y + 4iz + 3z = -10\n\nLet's solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = (19 + 6z) / 7\n\nNow substitute this expression for y in the second equation:\n\n3x - 4((19 + 6z) / 7) + 4iz + 3z = -10\n\nClear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 7:\n\n21x - 4(19 + 6z) + 28iz + 21z = -70\n\nDistribute the -4:\n\n21x - 76 - 24z + 28iz + 21z = -70\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n21x - 76 - 3z + 28iz = -70\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n21x = 70 - 28iz + 76 + 3z\nx = (146 + 3z - 28iz) / 21\n\nNow we have expressions for x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = (146 + 3z - 28iz) / 21\ny = (19 + 6z) / 7\n\nSubstitute these expressions for x and y in any of the original equations. We'll use the first one:\n\nx + 2y - z = 6\n(146 + 3z - 28iz) / 21 + 2(19 + 6z) / 7 - z = 6\n\nClear the fractions by multiplying both sides by 21:\n\n(146 + 3z - 28iz) + 6(19 + 6z) - 21z = 126\n\nDistribute the 6:\n\n146 + 3z - 28iz + 114 + 36z - 21z = 126\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n18z - 28iz = -134\n\nNow, we have a single equation with the variable z:\n\n18z - 28iz = -134\n\nTo solve for z, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nz(18 - 28i) = -134\n\nNow, divide both sides by (18 - 28i):\n\nz = -134 / (18 - 28i)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, (18 + 28i):\n\nz = (-134 * (18 + 28i)) / ((18 - 28i) * (18 + 28i))\n\nMultiply the numerator:\n\nz = (-2412 - 3752i) / (18^2 + 28^2)\n\nDivide by the denominator:\n\nz = (-2412 - 3752i) / (324 + 784)\nz = (-2412 - 3752i) / 1108\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = -2412/1108 - 3752i/1108\nz = -2 - 3.4i\n\nNow that we have z, we can find x and y using the expressions we found earlier:\n\nx = (146 + 3z - 28iz) / 21\nx = (146 + 3(-2 - 3.4i) - 28i(-2 - 3.4i)) / 21\nx = (146 - 6 - 10.2i + 56i + 95.2i^2) / 21\nx = (140 + 45.8i - 95.2) / 21\nx = (44.8 + 45.8i) / 21\nx = 2.4 + 2.2i\n\ny = (19 + 6z) / 7\ny = (19 + 6(-2 - 3.4i)) / 7\ny = (19 - 12 - 20.4i) / 7\ny = (7 - 20.4i) / 7\ny = 1 - 2.9i\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 2.4 + 2.2i\ny = 1 - 2.9i\nz = -2 - 3.4i"
