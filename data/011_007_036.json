    "message_2": "To find the closed-form expression for $a_n$, we can first compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify a pattern:\n\n$a_0 = 2$\n\n$a_1 = 4a_0 - 4 = 4(2) - 4 = 4$\n\n$a_2 = 4a_1 - 4 = 4(4) - 4 = 12$\n\n$a_3 = 4a_2 - 4 = 4(12) - 4 = 44$\n\n$a_4 = 4a_3 - 4 = 4(44) - 4 = 172$\n\nThe sequence appears to be $2, 4, 12, 44, 172, \\dots$. We can see that each term is a power of 2 multiplied by an odd number. Let's rewrite the sequence in terms of powers of 2:\n\n$a_0 = 2^1$\n\n$a_1 = 2^2$\n\n$a_2 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$\n\n$a_3 = 2^3 \\cdot 5$\n\n$a_4 = 2^4 \\cdot 9$\n\nNow, we can see a pattern: $a_n = 2^{n+1} \\cdot (2n-1)$. Let's prove this by induction.\n\nBase case: For $n = 0$, we have $a_0 = 2^{0+1} \\cdot (2\\cdot 0 - 1) = 2^1 \\cdot (-1) = 2$, which is true.\n\nInductive step: Assume that the formula holds for $n = k$, i.e., $a_k = 2^{k+1} \\cdot (2k-1)$. We want to show that the formula also holds for $n = k+1$, i.e., $a_{k+1} = 2^{(k+1)+1} \\cdot (2(k+1)-1)$.\n\nUsing the recursive formula, we have:\n\n$a_{k+1} = 4a_k - 4$\n\nSubstitute the inductive hypothesis:\n\n$a_{k+1} = 4(2^{k+1} \\cdot (2k-1)) - 4$\n\n$a_{k+1} = 2^{(k+1)+1} \\cdot (2k-1) - 4$\n\nNow, we want to show that this is equal to $2^{(k+1)+1} \\cdot (2(k+1)-1)$:\n\n$2^{(k+1)+1} \\cdot (2(k+1)-1) = 2^{k+2} \\cdot (2k+1)$\n\nComparing the two expressions for $a_{k+1}$, we can see that they are indeed equal:\n\n$2^{(k+1)+1} \\cdot (2k-1) - 4 = 2^{k+2} \\cdot (2k+1)$\n\nThus, by induction, the closed-form expression for $a_n$ is:\n\n$$a_n = 2^{n+1} \\cdot (2n-1)$$"
