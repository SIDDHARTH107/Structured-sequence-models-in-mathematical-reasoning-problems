    "message_1": "A city has a population of 100,000 people. An infectious disease is spreading in the city and is expected to infect 10% of the population in the first week. The rate at which infected people recover is 20% per week. Using a differential equation model, calculate how many people are infected after 4 weeks.",
    "message_2": "To model this situation, we can use the following differential equation:\n\ndI/dt = rI - cI\n\nwhere I is the number of infected people, r is the infection rate, and c is the recovery rate.\n\nIn this case, r = 0.1 (10% infection rate) and c = 0.2 (20% recovery rate).\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial number of infected people after the first week:\n\nI(0) = 100,000 * 0.1 = 10,000\n\nNow, we can solve the differential equation:\n\ndI/dt = 0.1I - 0.2I\ndI/dt = -0.1I\n\nSeparating variables and integrating:\n\n∫(1/I) dI = ∫(-0.1) dt\nln(I) = -0.1t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition I(0) = 10,000:\n\nln(10,000) = -0.1(0) + C\nC = ln(10,000)\n\nNow we can write the general solution:\n\nln(I) = -0.1t + ln(10,000)\nI(t) = e^(-0.1t + ln(10,000))\n\nTo find the number of infected people after 4 weeks, we can plug in t = 4:\n\nI(4) = e^(-0.1(4) + ln(10,000))\nI(4) = e^(-0.4 + ln(10,000))\nI(4) = e^(ln(10,000) - 0.4)\nI(4) = 10,000 * e^(-0.4)\n\nI(4) ≈ 10,000 * 0.6703\nI(4) ≈ 6,703\n\nAfter 4 weeks, approximately 6,703 people are infected in the city."
