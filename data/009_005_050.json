    "message_2": "To find the current amplitude in the RLC circuit, we first need to determine the impedance (Z) of the circuit. The impedance of an RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, XL is the inductive reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance.\n\nFirst, let's find the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC):\n\nXL = 2 * π * f * L\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, L is the inductance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven values:\nR = 50 ohms\nL = 0.1 Henry\nC = 10 * 10^(-6) Farads (converting microfarads to farads)\nf = 1000 Hz\n\nNow, let's calculate XL and XC:\n\nXL = 2 * π * 1000 * 0.1 = 200π ≈ 628.32 ohms\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * 1000 * 10 * 10^(-6)) = 1 / (20π * 10^(-3)) ≈ 15.92 ohms\n\nNow we can find the impedance (Z):\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2) = √(50^2 + (628.32 - 15.92)^2) ≈ √(50^2 + 612.4^2) ≈ 615.54 ohms\n\nNow that we have the impedance, we can find the current amplitude (I) using Ohm's Law:\n\nI = V / Z\n\nwhere V is the voltage amplitude.\n\nGiven value:\nV = 20 volts\n\nNow, let's calculate the current amplitude:\n\nI = 20 / 615.54 ≈ 0.0325 A\n\nSo, the current amplitude in the circuit is approximately 0.0325 A (or 32.5 mA)."
