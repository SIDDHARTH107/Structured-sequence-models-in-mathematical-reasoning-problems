    "message_2": "To decrypt a message encrypted with the rail fence cipher with 3 rails, we need to arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern and then read the message horizontally. The encrypted message is \"TCSNRRBIIAOEPYMCGO\" and has 17 characters. We can arrange the letters as follows:\n\nT . . . S . . . R . . . I . . . M . . . G\n. C . N . R . B . I . A . O . E . P . Y . C\n. . O . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . O\n\nNow, we can read the plaintext message horizontally:\n\nTSCIENCEPROGRAMYRCO\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"TSCIENCEPROGRAMYRCO\"."
