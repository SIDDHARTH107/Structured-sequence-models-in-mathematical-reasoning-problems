    "message_1": "Suppose a company manufactures two types of products P and Q. The production of P requires 3 hours of processing time and 4 hours of assembly time, while the production of Q requires 4 hours of processing time and 2 hours of assembly time. The company has 45 hours of processing time and 40 hours of assembly time available each week. The profits per unit of P and Q are $5 and $7, respectively. What is the optimal production quantity of P and Q that will maximize the total profit of the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product P and y be the number of units of product Q. The constraints for processing time and assembly time can be written as:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 45 (processing time constraint)\n4x + 2y ≤ 40 (assembly time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nProfit = 5x + 7y\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem graphically by finding the feasible region and then determining the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints as equalities to plot the lines:\n\n3x + 4y = 45\n4x + 2y = 40\n\nNow, we'll solve for y in each equation:\n\ny = (45 - 3x) / 4\ny = (40 - 4x) / 2\n\nPlot these lines along with the non-negativity constraints (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0) to find the feasible region. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at points A(0, 0), B(0, 11.25), C(6, 7.5), and D(10, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nA(0, 0): Profit = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\nB(0, 11.25): Profit = 5(0) + 7(11.25) = $78.75\nC(6, 7.5): Profit = 5(6) + 7(7.5) = $67.50\nD(10, 0): Profit = 5(10) + 7(0) = $50\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point B(0, 11.25) with a profit of $78.75. Therefore, the optimal production quantity is to produce 0 units of product P and 11.25 units of product Q. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, they should produce 11 units of product Q and adjust the production of product P accordingly to stay within the constraints. In this case, the company can produce 1 unit of product P and still stay within the constraints. The total profit would then be 5(1) + 7(11) = $82."
