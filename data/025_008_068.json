    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials on an elliptic curve, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a compact Riemann surface X of genus g, the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials is given by:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) - g + 1 + l(K - D),\n\nwhere K is the canonical divisor, and l(K - D) is the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials of degree K - D.\n\nFor an elliptic curve, the genus g is 1. In our case, the elliptic curve is given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x$. We can rewrite this equation as $y^2 - x^3 + x = 0$. The degree of this equation is 3, which means that the degree of the canonical divisor K is 2g - 2 = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the divisor D associated with the holomorphic differentials on this elliptic curve. Since the degree of K is 0, we have:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) - g + 1 + l(K - D) = deg(D) - 1.\n\nTo find the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials, we need to find the degree of D. For an elliptic curve, the degree of D is equal to the degree of the canonical divisor K, which is 0 in our case. Therefore, the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials is:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nHowever, the dimension of a vector space cannot be negative. This means that the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials on this elliptic curve is 0."
