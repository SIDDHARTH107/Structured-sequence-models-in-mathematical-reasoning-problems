The company wants to use discriminant analysis to determine if there is a relationship between the engine size and the type of car. \n\nThe data they collected is shown in the table below:\n\n| Car Type | Engine Size (liters) | Gas Mileage (mpg) |\n|----------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Sedan    |               2.2     |        35         |\n| Sedan    |               1.8     |        42         |\n| SUV      |               3.5     |        22         |\n| SUV      |               2.8     |        28         |\n| Truck    |               5.0     |        15         |\n| Truck    |               6.2     |        13         |\n\nWhat is the discriminant function for predicting the type of car based on the engine size? If a new car has an engine size of 3.0 liters, what type of car would the discriminant function predict it to be?",
    "message_2": "To perform a discriminant analysis, we first need to calculate the means and standard deviations for each car type's engine size. \n\nFor sedans:\nMean engine size = (2.2 + 1.8) / 2 = 2.0 liters\nStandard deviation = sqrt(((2.2 - 2.0)^2 + (1.8 - 2.0)^2) / 2) = sqrt(0.08) = 0.2828\n\nFor SUVs:\nMean engine size = (3.5 + 2.8) / 2 = 3.15 liters\nStandard deviation = sqrt(((3.5 - 3.15)^2 + (2.8 - 3.15)^2) / 2) = sqrt(0.1225) = 0.35\n\nFor trucks:\nMean engine size = (5.0 + 6.2) / 2 = 5.6 liters\nStandard deviation = sqrt(((5.0 - 5.6)^2 + (6.2 - 5.6)^2) / 2) = sqrt(0.72) = 0.8485\n\nNow, we can calculate the discriminant function for each car type using the following formula:\n\nD(x) = (x - mean) / standard deviation\n\nFor sedans: D(x) = (x - 2.0) / 0.2828\nFor SUVs: D(x) = (x - 3.15) / 0.35\nFor trucks: D(x) = (x - 5.6) / 0.8485\n\nNow, let's use the discriminant functions to predict the type of car with an engine size of 3.0 liters:\n\nD_sedan(3.0) = (3.0 - 2.0) / 0.2828 = 3.53\nD_SUV(3.0) = (3.0 - 3.15) / 0.35 = -0.43\nD_truck(3.0) = (3.0 - 5.6) / 0.8485 = -3.07\n\nSince D_sedan(3.0) has the highest value, the discriminant function predicts that a car with an engine size of 3.0 liters would be a sedan."
