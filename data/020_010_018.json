    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve in Robust Optimization:\n\nA manufacturer produces two types of products A and B. The profit margins for A and B are $10 and $15 respectively. Due to uncertain demand for the products, the sales manager has estimated that the demand for A could be as high as 600 units and as low as 300 units, while the demand for B could be as high as 500 units and as low as 200 units. The production manager needs to decide how many units of A and B to manufacture to maximize the expected profit. What is the optimal production plan for the manufacturer?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using robust optimization, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the uncertain demand. We will use the lower bounds of the demand estimates to ensure that the production plan is robust against the uncertainty.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A to be produced, and y be the number of units of product B to be produced. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nMaximize: P = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product B)\nx ≤ 300 (lower bound of demand for product A)\ny ≤ 200 (lower bound of demand for product B)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal production plan.\n\nThe feasible region is a rectangle with vertices at (0,0), (300,0), (0,200), and (300,200). We can evaluate the profit function at these vertices:\n\nP(0,0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0\nP(300,0) = 10(300) + 15(0) = 3000\nP(0,200) = 10(0) + 15(200) = 3000\nP(300,200) = 10(300) + 15(200) = 6000\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (300,200), with a profit of $6000. Therefore, the optimal production plan for the manufacturer is to produce 300 units of product A and 200 units of product B."
