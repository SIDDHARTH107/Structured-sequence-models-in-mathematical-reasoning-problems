    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal shape formed by recursively removing smaller tetrahedrons from a larger one. The number of small tetrahedrons required to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the number of levels.\n\nFor a Sierpinski tetrahedron made up of 4 levels:\n\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = (4^4 - 1) / 3\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = (256 - 1) / 3\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = 255 / 3\nNumber of small tetrahedrons = 85\n\nSo, 85 small tetrahedrons are required to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron made up of 4 levels."
