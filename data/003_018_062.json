    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = sin(3x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if y = f(g(x)), then the derivative of y with respect to x is dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nIn this case, we have f(u) = sin(u) and g(x) = 3x. So, we need to find the derivatives of f(u) and g(x) with respect to their respective variables.\n\nThe derivative of f(u) = sin(u) with respect to u is f'(u) = cos(u).\nThe derivative of g(x) = 3x with respect to x is g'(x) = 3.\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\ndy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = cos(3x) * 3 = 3cos(3x).\n\nNow we need to find the derivative at x = π/6:\ndy/dx(π/6) = 3cos(3(π/6)) = 3cos(π/2).\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, the derivative at x = π/6 is:\ndy/dx(π/6) = 3 * 0 = 0."
