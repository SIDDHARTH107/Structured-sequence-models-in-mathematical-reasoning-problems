    "message_2": "Sparse matrix representation is a technique used to store and manipulate matrices with a large number of zero elements. However, the given system of linear equations does not have a large number of zero elements. Instead, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve for x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 3  2  4 | 10\n| 6 -3  2 | -5\n| 5  7 -3 | 15\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  2/3  4/3 | 10/3\n| 6 -3    2   | -5\n| 5  7   -3   | 15\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 6 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 5 * Row1\n\n| 1  2/3  4/3 | 10/3\n| 0 -7   -10  | -35\n| 0  5/3 -7   | 5\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -7 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  2/3  4/3 | 10/3\n| 0  1   10/7 |  5\n| 0  5/3 -7   | 5\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 - (5/3) * Row2\n\n| 1  2/3  4/3 | 10/3\n| 0  1   10/7 |  5\n| 0  0  -61/3 | -10\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -61/3 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  2/3  4/3 | 10/3\n| 0  1   10/7 |  5\n| 0  0    1   |  10/61\n\nStep 6: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = 10/61\n\ny = 5 - (10/7) * z\ny = 5 - (10/7) * (10/61)\ny = 5 - (100/427)\ny = (1715 - 100) / 427\ny = 1615 / 427\n\nx = (10/3) - (2/3) * y - (4/3) * z\nx = (10/3) - (2/3) * (1615/427) - (4/3) * (10/61)\nx = (10/3) - (3230/1281) - (40/183)\nx = (3660 - 3230 - 40) / 1281\nx = 390 / 1281\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 390/1281\ny = 1615/427\nz = 10/61"
