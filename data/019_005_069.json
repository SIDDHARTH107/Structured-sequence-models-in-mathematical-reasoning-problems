    "message_1": "A group of four people are each wearing a hat that could be either red or blue. Each person can see the other three hats but cannot see their own. They are asked to guess the color of their hat at the same time. Assuming that they can hear each other's responses but cannot communicate in any other way, what is the probability that all four guess correctly?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible combinations of red and blue hats. There are 2^4 = 16 possible combinations, since each person can wear either a red or blue hat. We can list them as follows:\n\n1. RRRR\n2. RRRB\n3. RRBR\n4. RBBR\n5. RRBB\n6. RBRB\n7. RBRR\n8. RBBB\n9. BRRR\n10. BRRB\n11. BRBR\n12. BBRB\n13. BRBB\n14. BBRR\n15. BBRB\n16. BBBB\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where all four people guess correctly. Since they cannot communicate and have no information about their own hat color, they can only guess randomly. The probability of guessing correctly for each person is 1/2.\n\nFor all four people to guess correctly, each person must guess their hat color correctly independently. The probability of this happening is:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16\n\nSo, the probability that all four people guess their hat color correctly is 1/16 or 6.25%."
