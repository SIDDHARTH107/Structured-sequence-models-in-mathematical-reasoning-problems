    "message_1": "Suppose that you want to calculate the Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface of genus 2 using a topological quantum field theory. If the value of the partition function of the theory on the surface is Z=3/2, what is the Euler characteristic of the surface?",
    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface of genus g can be calculated using the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic (χ) = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a surface of genus 2, we have:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the surface is -2. Note that the value of the partition function Z=3/2 does not affect the calculation of the Euler characteristic in this case, as the formula for the Euler characteristic depends only on the genus of the surface."
