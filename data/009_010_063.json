    "message_1": "In an economy, a stock's price is currently $100 per share. Its volatility is estimated to be 30% and the risk-free interest rate is 2%. Assuming the stock does not pay dividends, what will be the price of a European call option with a strike price of $110 and an expiration time of one year according to the Black-Scholes equation?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to first calculate the values of d1 and d2, which are given by the following formulas:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price ($100)\nK = strike price ($110)\nr = risk-free interest rate (0.02)\nσ = volatility (0.30)\nT = time to expiration in years (1)\n\nLet's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.02 + (0.30^2)/2) * 1) / (0.30 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.065) / 0.30\nd1 = -0.101\n\nd2 = -0.101 - 0.30 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = -0.401\n\nNow, we can calculate the price of the European call option (C) using the Black-Scholes equation:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the values of N(d1) and N(d2):\n\nN(-0.101) ≈ 0.4599\nN(-0.401) ≈ 0.3440\n\nNow, we can calculate the price of the European call option:\n\nC = 100 * 0.4599 - 110 * e^(-0.02 * 1) * 0.3440\nC = 45.99 - 110 * 0.9802 * 0.3440\nC = 45.99 - 37.03\nC ≈ $8.96\n\nTherefore, the price of a European call option with a strike price of $110 and an expiration time of one year according to the Black-Scholes equation is approximately $8.96."
