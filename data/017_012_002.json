    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, we will use the properties of groups of order 2^k and the Sylow theorems. We will first find the number of elements of order 2 in G.\n\nLet n_2 be the number of elements of order 2 in G. Since G has order 16, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 2 and divides 16. Thus, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is either 1 or 2^k for some k ≥ 1. \n\nCase 1: G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P.\nIn this case, P is a normal subgroup of G, and |P| = 16. Since P is a p-group (p = 2), it has a non-trivial center, so |Z(P)| ≥ 2. If |Z(P)| = 2, then P has an element of order 2, and since P is normal in G, this element is in the center of G. Thus, G has an element of order 2, so n_2 ≥ 1.\n\nCase 2: G has more than one Sylow 2-subgroup.\nIn this case, let P and Q be distinct Sylow 2-subgroups of G. Since |P ∩ Q| divides |P| and |Q|, and |P ∩ Q| = 1 or 2, we have two possibilities:\n\n1) |P ∩ Q| = 1: In this case, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Since P and Q are distinct, there exists an element x in P but not in Q, and an element y in Q but not in P. Then, x and y are both of order 2, and x ≠ y, so n_2 ≥ 2.\n\n2) |P ∩ Q| = 2: In this case, P ∩ Q is a subgroup of order 2, so it contains an element of order 2. Thus, n_2 ≥ 1.\n\nIn all cases, we have n_2 ≥ 1. Now, we will analyze the structure of G based on the number of elements of order 2.\n\nIf n_2 = 1, then G has a unique element of order 2, say x. Since G has order 16, there exists an element y in G such that y is not a power of x. Then, the subgroup generated by x and y, ⟨x, y⟩, has order at least 4. If |⟨x, y⟩| = 4, then ⟨x, y⟩ is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). In either case, G is a semidirect product of ⟨x⟩ and ⟨y⟩, so G is isomorphic to either C16 or D8.\n\nIf n_2 > 1, then G has at least two elements of order 2, say x and y. If G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C2 × C2 × C2 × C2. Since n_2 > 1, G cannot be isomorphic to C16. If G is isomorphic to C8 × C2, then G has exactly one element of order 2, which contradicts n_2 > 1. If G is isomorphic to C4 × C4, then G has exactly two elements of order 2, which is possible. If G is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2 × C2, then G has exactly 8 elements of order 2, which is also possible. Thus, G is either isomorphic to C4 × C4 or C2 × C2 × C2 × C2.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then G has at least one non-abelian subgroup of order 8, say H. Since H has order 8, it has a unique element of order 2, say z. Then, G is a semidirect product of H and ⟨z⟩, so G is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16."
