    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 4 hours of machine time and 2 hours of assembly time, while each unit of Product B requires 6 hours of machine time and 2 hours of assembly time. The company has 40 hours of machine time available and 16 hours of assembly time available each day. The profit per unit of Product A is $10 and the profit per unit of Product B is $14. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can make each day if it produces both products A and B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and assembly time are as follows:\n\nMachine time: 4x + 6y ≤ 40\nAssembly time: 2x + 2y ≤ 16\n\nWe can simplify the assembly time constraint by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + y ≤ 8\n\nNow, we want to maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 14y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints in terms of y:\n\ny ≤ (40 - 4x) / 6\ny ≤ (16 - 2x) / 2\n\ny ≤ (20 - 2x) / 3\ny ≤ 8 - x\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1) Intersection of y = (20 - 2x) / 3 and y = 8 - x:\n\n(20 - 2x) / 3 = 8 - x\n20 - 2x = 24 - 3x\nx = 4\n\ny = 8 - 4 = 4\n\nVertex 1: (4, 4)\n\n2) Intersection of y = (20 - 2x) / 3 and x = 0:\n\ny = (20 - 2(0)) / 3\ny = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67\n\nVertex 2: (0, 6.67)\n\n3) Intersection of y = 8 - x and x = 0:\n\ny = 8 - 0 = 8\n\nVertex 3: (0, 8)\n\n4) Intersection of y = 8 - x and y = 0:\n\n0 = 8 - x\nx = 8\n\nVertex 4: (8, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1) Profit(4, 4) = 10(4) + 14(4) = 40 + 56 = $96\n2) Profit(0, 6.67) ≈ 10(0) + 14(6.67) = $93.38\n3) Profit(0, 8) = 10(0) + 14(8) = $112\n4) Profit(8, 0) = 10(8) + 14(0) = $80\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at Vertex 3, where the company produces 0 units of Product A and 8 units of Product B, resulting in a daily profit of $112."
