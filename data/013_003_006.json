    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game between two players, player A offers a split of $100 between themselves and player B. If player B accepts the offer, they both get the split as proposed. If player B rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. What is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "In the ultimatum game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when player A offers the smallest possible amount to player B, and player B accepts the offer. This is because player B is better off accepting any positive amount rather than rejecting the offer and receiving nothing. \n\nLet's assume the smallest possible amount is $1 (or any other small positive amount). In this case, player A would offer $99 to themselves and $1 to player B. Player B, knowing that receiving $1 is better than receiving nothing, would accept the offer. This is the Nash equilibrium, as neither player has an incentive to change their strategy given the other player's strategy."
