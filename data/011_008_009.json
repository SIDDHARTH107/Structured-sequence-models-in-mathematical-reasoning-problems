    "message_2": "To choose a team of 5 players from a field of 10 players, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 10 players and k = 5 players to choose.\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 30,240 / 120\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo there are 252 ways to choose a team of 5 players from a field of 10 players."
