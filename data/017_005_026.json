    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G must divide 27 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibilities are 1 and 27. \n\nCase 1: There is only one 3-Sylow subgroup in G.\nIn this case, the unique 3-Sylow subgroup, say P, must be normal in G since it is the only one of its kind. Since the order of P is 27, P must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z_27, Z_3 x Z_9, or Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_3. \n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z_27, then G is cyclic. If P is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_9, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9. If P is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_3, then G has an element of order 9 (by Cauchy's theorem), say x, and an element of order 3, say y. Then G is generated by x and y, and since the order of x and y are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: There are 27 3-Sylow subgroups in G.\nIn this case, each 3-Sylow subgroup has order 3^2 = 9, and there are 27 of them. Since there are 27 elements of order 3 in G, each 3-Sylow subgroup must contain 3 elements of order 3. Let H be one of these 3-Sylow subgroups. Then H is isomorphic to Z_9 or Z_3 x Z_3. \n\nIf H is isomorphic to Z_9, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9. If H is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3, then G has an element of order 9 (by Cauchy's theorem), say x, and an element of order 3, say y. Then G is generated by x and y, and since the order of x and y are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 27 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
