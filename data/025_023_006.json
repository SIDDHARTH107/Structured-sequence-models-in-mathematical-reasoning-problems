    "message_2": "To prove that the degree of the natural map i^*: H^4(X)-->H^4(Y) induced by the inclusion i is nonzero, we will use the Poincaré duality and the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n\nFirst, recall the Poincaré duality for smooth projective varieties. For a smooth projective variety X of dimension n, there is a natural isomorphism between the cohomology groups H^k(X) and H^{2n-k}(X) given by the cup product with the fundamental class [X] ∈ H^{2n}(X). In our case, X is a smooth projective variety of dimension 4, so we have an isomorphism between H^4(X) and H^4(X) given by the cup product with the fundamental class [X] ∈ H^8(X).\n\nNow, let Y be a closed subvariety of X of codimension 2. Since Y is of codimension 2, it is a divisor in X, and we can consider the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth projective variety X of dimension n and a hyperplane section Y of X, the restriction map H^k(X)-->H^k(Y) is an isomorphism for k < n and an injection for k = n. In our case, Y is a divisor in X, so it is a hyperplane section, and the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem applies.\n\nWe are given that IH^4(Y) is nonzero, which implies that H^4(Y) is nonzero. Since Y is a hyperplane section of X, the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem tells us that the restriction map i^*: H^4(X)-->H^4(Y) is injective. Since H^4(Y) is nonzero, this implies that the degree of the map i^* is nonzero.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the natural map i^*: H^4(X)-->H^4(Y) induced by the inclusion i is nonzero."
