    "message_2": "To find the union of set A and set B, we combine all the unique elements from both sets. \n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNow, we need to show that the resulting set is a superset of set A and set B. A set C is a superset of set A if every element of set A is also an element of set C. Similarly, set C is a superset of set B if every element of set B is also an element of set C.\n\nFor set A:\n1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set A are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of set A.\n\nFor set B:\n4 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A ∪ B\n7 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set B are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of set B.\n\nTherefore, the union of set A and set B, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, is a superset of both set A and set B."
