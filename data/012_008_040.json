    "message_2": "To determine if a graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges can be drawn on a planar surface without any of the edges crossing each other, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn our case, v = 8 and e = 10. We want to find out if there exists a value for f such that the equation holds true.\n\n8 - 10 + f = 2\nf = 4\n\nSo, if the graph is planar, it must have 4 faces. Now, we can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for simple connected planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for our graph:\n\n10 ≤ 3 * 8 - 6\n10 ≤ 18\n\nSince the inequality holds true, it is possible that the graph is planar. Now, we need to find a way to draw the graph without any edges crossing each other.\n\nOne possible way to draw the graph is as follows:\n\n1. Draw a hexagon with vertices A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n2. Add two more vertices, G and H, inside the hexagon.\n3. Connect vertices G and H to each of the vertices A, B, and C.\n4. Connect vertices G and H to each other.\n\nThis graph has 8 vertices, 10 edges, and 4 faces, and no edges are crossing each other. Therefore, it is possible to draw a graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges on a planar surface without any of the edges crossing each other."
