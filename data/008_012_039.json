    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 5  7 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 13 |\n    | 29 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted by A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (2 * 7) - (3 * 5) = 14 - 15 = -1\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdjoint(A) = |  7  -3 |\n             | -5   2 |\n\nNow, multiply the adjoint of A by the reciprocal of the determinant.\n\nA^(-1) = (-1) * |  7  -3 |\n                | -5   2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -7   3 |\n         |  5  -2 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -7   3 | * | 13 |\n    |  5  -2 |   | 29 |\n\nTo perform the matrix multiplication:\n\nx = (-7 * 13) + (3 * 29) = -91 + 87 = -4\ny = (5 * 13) + (-2 * 29) = 65 - 58 = 7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = -4 and y = 7."
