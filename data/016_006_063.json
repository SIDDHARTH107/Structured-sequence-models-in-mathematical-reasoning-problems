    "message_1": "What is the ratio of the number of points that belong to the stem of a Barnsley fern to the number of points that belong to the entire fern after the 10th iteration, if we start with a single point at the origin (0, 0)?",
    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) consisting of four affine transformations. The transformations are applied to points in the plane, and the probabilities of each transformation being applied are as follows:\n\n1. f1 (Stem): 0.01\n2. f2 (Successively smaller leaflets): 0.85\n3. f3 (Largest left-hand leaflet): 0.07\n4. f4 (Largest right-hand leaflet): 0.07\n\nAfter the 10th iteration, we will have 2^10 = 1024 points in total. To find the ratio of the number of points that belong to the stem to the number of points that belong to the entire fern, we need to calculate the expected number of points that belong to the stem after 10 iterations.\n\nThe probability of a point belonging to the stem after one iteration is 0.01. After 10 iterations, the expected number of points belonging to the stem is:\n\n1024 * 0.01 = 10.24\n\nThus, the ratio of the number of points that belong to the stem to the number of points that belong to the entire fern after the 10th iteration is:\n\n10.24 / 1024 = 0.01\n\nSo, the ratio is 0.01 or 1%."
