    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 4 players who each contribute a certain amount of money towards a public project. The total cost of the project is $100. Each player's payoff depends on their contribution and the contributions of the other players. The payoff for each player is calculated as follows:\n\nPayoff = (Total contributions / Number of players) - Contribution + 10\n\nFor example, if all players contribute $20 each, then the total contributions would be $80 and each player's payoff would be:\n\n(80 / 4) - 20 + 10 = $5\n\nIf player 1 contributes $30, player 2 contributes $20, player 3 contributes $10, and player 4 contributes $40, what is the payoff for each player?",
    "message_2": "To find the payoff for each player, we first need to calculate the total contributions:\n\nTotal contributions = Player 1's contribution + Player 2's contribution + Player 3's contribution + Player 4's contribution\nTotal contributions = $30 + $20 + $10 + $40 = $100\n\nNow, we can calculate the payoff for each player using the formula:\n\nPayoff = (Total contributions / Number of players) - Contribution + 10\n\nPlayer 1's payoff:\n(100 / 4) - 30 + 10 = 25 - 30 + 10 = -$5\n\nPlayer 2's payoff:\n(100 / 4) - 20 + 10 = 25 - 20 + 10 = $15\n\nPlayer 3's payoff:\n(100 / 4) - 10 + 10 = 25 - 10 + 10 = $25\n\nPlayer 4's payoff:\n(100 / 4) - 40 + 10 = 25 - 40 + 10 = -$5\n\nSo, the payoffs for each player are as follows:\nPlayer 1: -$5\nPlayer 2: $15\nPlayer 3: $25\nPlayer 4: -$5"
