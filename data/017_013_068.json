Thus, the order of D9 is 18. The elements of D9 can be represented as {r^n, sr^n} where r is a rotation, s is a reflection, and n is an integer from 0 to 8.\n\nNow, let's consider a group G of order 18. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3 and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup Q of order 9. Since P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G.\n\nNow, let's examine the properties of D9. In D9, the rotations form a cyclic subgroup R of order 9, which is isomorphic to the Sylow 2-subgroup Q of G. The reflections in D9 form a subgroup S of order 2, which is not normal in D9.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G, we can consider the semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as P ⋊ Q. The semidirect product is a group formed by combining P and Q in such a way that the elements of P and Q commute with each other. In this case, since P and Q are normal in G, the semidirect product P ⋊ Q is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, which is a group of order 18.\n\nNow, we will show that the direct product P × Q cannot be isomorphic to D9. In the direct product P × Q, every element of order 2 is of the form (1, q) where q is an element of order 2 in Q. Since Q is a cyclic group of order 9, it has exactly one element of order 2. Therefore, P × Q has only one element of order 2.\n\nHowever, in D9, there are 9 elements of order 2, which are the reflections. Since P × Q has only one element of order 2 and D9 has 9 elements of order 2, P × Q cannot be isomorphic to D9.\n\nThus, we have shown that a group of order 18 cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D9."
