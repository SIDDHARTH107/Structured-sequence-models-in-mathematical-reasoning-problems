    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6, we will analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet p be a prime number and let n_p be the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. n_p divides |G|.\n2. n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nSince |G| = 12 = 2^2 * 3, we have two prime factors: 2 and 3. We will analyze the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, we have n_2 divides 3, and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 or 3.\n\nFor the Sylow 3-subgroups, we have n_3 divides 4, and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the values of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are unique, they are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Then G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to C4 x C3, which is isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to C12, as C12 has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. G also cannot be isomorphic to A4, as A4 has four Sylow 3-subgroups. However, G can be isomorphic to D6, as D6 has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to C12 or D6, as both have a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. However, G can be isomorphic to A4, as A4 has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6, as none of these groups have this combination of Sylow subgroups.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6, depending on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. However, without more information about G, we cannot determine which specific group G is isomorphic to."
