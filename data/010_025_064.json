    "message_2": "In a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), the assignment of vector spaces to topological spaces is functorial. This means that if we have a topological space X and a continuous map f: X -> Y, then the TQFT assigns a linear map between the vector spaces assigned to X and Y.\n\nWhen we glue two circles together to form a torus, we can think of this as taking the product of the two circles, i.e., the torus is S^1 x S^1, where S^1 is the circle. In a TQFT, the assignment of vector spaces to topological spaces is multiplicative for products of spaces. In other words, if a TQFT assigns a vector space V to a circle, then it assigns the tensor product V âŠ— V to the torus.\n\nIn this case, the TQFT assigns a vector space of dimension 4 to a circle. Therefore, the vector space assigned to the torus is the tensor product of two 4-dimensional vector spaces, which has dimension 4 * 4 = 16. So the dimension of the vector space assigned to the torus is 16."
