    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 15 and 20 can be found by first listing the prime factors of each number:\n\n15 = 3 × 5\n20 = 2 × 2 × 5\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factorization and multiply them together:\n\nLCM(15, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60\n\nSo, the LCM of 15 and 20 is 60."
