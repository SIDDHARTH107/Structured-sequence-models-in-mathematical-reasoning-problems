    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2) * x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = ((3/2) * x^(1/2))^2 = (9/4) * x\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9/4) * x\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of the expression:\n\n√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = √(1 + (9/4) * x)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + (9/4) * x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 1 + (9/4) * x\ndu/dx = (9/4)\ndx = (4/9) * du\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(u) * (4/9) du\n\nWe also need to change the limits of integration. When x = 1:\n\nu = 1 + (9/4) * 1 = 1 + (9/4) = 13/4\n\nWhen x = 4:\n\nu = 1 + (9/4) * 4 = 1 + 9 = 10\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral with the new limits of integration:\n\nL = (4/9) * ∫[13/4, 10] u^(1/2) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * [(2/3) * u^(3/2)] | [13/4, 10]\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nL = (4/9) * [(2/3) * (10^(3/2) - (13/4)^(3/2))]\n\nL ≈ (4/9) * [(2/3) * (15.81 - 4.42)]\n\nL ≈ (4/9) * [(2/3) * 11.39]\n\nL ≈ 8.52\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4 is approximately 8.52."
