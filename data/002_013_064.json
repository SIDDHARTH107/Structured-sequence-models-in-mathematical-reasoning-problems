    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, you can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the base length and base width:\n\nBase Area = Base Length * Base Width\nBase Area = 6 cm * 8 cm\nBase Area = 48 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\nVolume = (1/3) * 48 cm² * 10 cm\nVolume = 16 cm² * 10 cm\nVolume = 160 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
