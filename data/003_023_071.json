    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = √(9 + 4 + 1) = √14\n|B| = √(2^2 + 1^2 + 4^2) = √(4 + 1 + 16) = √21\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between A and B. We can use the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B. The dot product is calculated as follows:\n\nA · B = (3 * 2) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 4) = 6 + 2 + 4 = 12\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = 12 / (√14 * √21) = 12 / (√294)\n\nNow, we can find sin(θ) using the identity sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1:\n\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - cos^2(θ) = 1 - (12 / √294)^2 = 1 - (144 / 294)\nsin^2(θ) = 150 / 294\nsin(θ) = √(150 / 294) = √(50 / 98)\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n = (√14)(√21)(√(50 / 98)) n = (√(14 * 21 * 50 / 98)) n\n\nHowever, we cannot find the exact unit vector n using trigonometry alone. We need to use the standard method for finding the cross product:\n\nA x B = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1) = (2 - 4, 4 - 6, 3 - 4) = (-2, -2, -1)\n\nSo, the cross product A x B = -2i - 2j - k."
