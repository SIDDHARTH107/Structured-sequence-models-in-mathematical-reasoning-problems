    "message_2": "To find the highest and lowest points on the hill, we need to find the critical points of the function z(x, y) = 60 - 2x^2 - 3y^2. Critical points occur where the gradient of the function is zero or undefined. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the function with respect to x and y.\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂z/∂x = -4x\n∂z/∂y = -6y\n\nFor the gradient to be zero, both partial derivatives must be zero:\n\n-4x = 0 => x = 0\n-6y = 0 => y = 0\n\nSo, the critical point occurs at (x, y) = (0, 0). Now, let's find the corresponding z-value:\n\nz(0, 0) = 60 - 2(0)^2 - 3(0)^2 = 60\n\nThus, the highest point on the hill is at the point (0, 0, 60).\n\nAs for the lowest point, since the paraboloid opens downwards (due to the negative coefficients of x^2 and y^2), there is no lowest point on the hill. The hill will continue to decrease in height as x and y move further away from the origin."
