    "message_1": "Suppose that two individuals are considering starting a business venture together. Each person must decide whether to put a high level of effort (H) or a low level of effort (L) into the venture. If both individuals exert a high level of effort, they will achieve a profit of $10,000 each. If either individual exerts a low level of effort, they will achieve a profit of $8,000 each. However, if one individual exerts a low level of effort and the other exerts a high level of effort, the individual who exerts the high level of effort will only achieve a profit of $2,000 while the individual who exerts the low level of effort will achieve a profit of $12,000. Assume that each individual cares only about their own profit and has a 50-50 chance of putting in a high or low level of effort. What is the best strategy for each individual to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for each individual to maximize their expected profit, we can create a payoff matrix to analyze the possible outcomes. Let's denote the two individuals as A and B. The matrix will have the following form:\n\n```\n               B\n          |  H  |  L  |\n        --|-----|-----|\n       H  |10,10| 2,12|\n    A     |-----|-----|\n       L  |12, 2| 8, 8|\n```\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for each strategy:\n\n1. If A chooses H and B chooses H:\n   - Expected profit for A: 0.5 * $10,000 + 0.5 * $2,000 = $6,000\n   - Expected profit for B: 0.5 * $10,000 + 0.5 * $2,000 = $6,000\n\n2. If A chooses H and B chooses L:\n   - Expected profit for A: 0.5 * $2,000 + 0.5 * $10,000 = $6,000\n   - Expected profit for B: 0.5 * $12,000 + 0.5 * $8,000 = $10,000\n\n3. If A chooses L and B chooses H:\n   - Expected profit for A: 0.5 * $12,000 + 0.5 * $8,000 = $10,000\n   - Expected profit for B: 0.5 * $2,000 + 0.5 * $10,000 = $6,000\n\n4. If A chooses L and B chooses L:\n   - Expected profit for A: 0.5 * $8,000 + 0.5 * $8,000 = $8,000\n   - Expected profit for B: 0.5 * $8,000 + 0.5 * $8,000 = $8,000\n\nFrom the expected profits, we can see that the best strategy for each individual to maximize their expected profit is as follows:\n\n- For individual A: Choose L (low level of effort), as it results in an expected profit of $10,000 when B chooses H and $8,000 when B chooses L.\n- For individual B: Choose L (low level of effort), as it results in an expected profit of $10,000 when A chooses H and $8,000 when A chooses L.\n\nBoth individuals should choose a low level of effort to maximize their expected profit."
