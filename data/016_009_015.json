    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon Curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 6 iterations. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(6/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^3)\nLength = 1 * 8\nLength = 8 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon Curve after undergoing six iterations is 8 units."
