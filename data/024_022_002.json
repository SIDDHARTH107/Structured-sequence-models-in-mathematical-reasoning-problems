If $f(0)= (1,1)$ and $f(x,y)$ lies on the line $x-y+1=0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, determine the explicit formula for $f$.",
    "message_2": "Let's first analyze the given information. We know that $f$ is an isometry, which means it preserves distances. In other words, for any two points $P$ and $Q$ in the plane, the distance between $f(P)$ and $f(Q)$ is the same as the distance between $P$ and $Q$. We are also given that $f(0) = (1,1)$ and $f(x,y)$ lies on the line $x - y + 1 = 0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nSince $f$ is an isometry, it can be represented as a composition of a rotation, a reflection, and a translation. Let's first find the translation part. Since $f(0) = (1,1)$, the translation part is given by $(x,y) \\mapsto (x+1, y+1)$. Let's denote the remaining part of the transformation (rotation and/or reflection) by $g$, so we have $f(x,y) = g(x+1, y+1)$.\n\nNow, let's find the rotation/reflection part. Since $f(x,y)$ lies on the line $x - y + 1 = 0$, we have $g(x+1, y+1)$ lies on the line $x - y + 1 = 0$. In other words, $g(x,y)$ lies on the line $x - y = 0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. This line has slope $1$ and passes through the origin, so it is the line $y = x$. \n\nSince $g$ is an isometry, it must map the line $y = x$ to itself. There are two possibilities for $g$: either it is a rotation by $180^\\circ$ about the origin, or it is a reflection across the line $y = x$. Let's analyze each case.\n\n1. If $g$ is a rotation by $180^\\circ$ about the origin, then $g(x,y) = (-x, -y)$. In this case, $f(x,y) = g(x+1, y+1) = (-(x+1), -(y+1)) = (-x-1, -y-1)$.\n\n2. If $g$ is a reflection across the line $y = x$, then $g(x,y) = (y, x)$. In this case, $f(x,y) = g(x+1, y+1) = (y+1, x+1)$.\n\nNow, let's check which of these possibilities satisfies the condition that $f(x,y)$ lies on the line $x - y + 1 = 0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n1. For the first possibility, $f(x,y) = (-x-1, -y-1)$, we have $(-x-1) - (-y-1) + 1 = -x + y + 1$. This does not satisfy the condition, so this possibility is not correct.\n\n2. For the second possibility, $f(x,y) = (y+1, x+1)$, we have $(y+1) - (x+1) + 1 = y - x + 1$. This satisfies the condition, so this possibility is correct.\n\nTherefore, the explicit formula for $f$ is $f(x,y) = (y+1, x+1)$."
