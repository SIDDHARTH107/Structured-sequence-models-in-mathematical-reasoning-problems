    "message_2": "The remainder when 73 is divided by 5 using modular arithmetic can be found using the following equation:\n\n73 ≡ x (mod 5)\n\nTo find x, we can divide 73 by 5:\n\n73 ÷ 5 = 14 with a remainder of 3\n\nSo, the remainder when 73 is divided by 5 is 3. Therefore, x = 3, and we can write the equation as:\n\n73 ≡ 3 (mod 5)"
