Greedy Approximation Algorithm:\n\nIn the greedy approximation algorithm, we will iteratively choose the vertex with the highest degree (i.e., the vertex connected to the most edges) and add it to the vertex cover. We will remove the chosen vertex and its connected edges from the graph until there are no more edges left.\n\nStep 1: Vertex D has the highest degree (4). Add D to the vertex cover and remove D and its connected edges.\n```\n    A -- B\n         / \\\n        E---F\n```\nStep 2: Vertices A and B have the highest degree (2). We can choose either A or B. Let's choose A. Add A to the vertex cover and remove A and its connected edges.\n```\n        B\n         \\\n          E---F\n```\nStep 3: Vertex B has the highest degree (1). Add B to the vertex cover and remove B and its connected edges.\n```\n          E---F\n```\nStep 4: Vertices E and F have the highest degree (1). We can choose either E or F. Let's choose E. Add E to the vertex cover and remove E and its connected edges.\n```\n          F\n```\nNow, there are no more edges left. The vertex cover obtained using the greedy approximation algorithm is {A, B, D, E} with 4 vertices. Note that this is not the optimal solution, as the brute force algorithm found smaller vertex covers. However, the greedy approximation algorithm is faster and can be used for larger graphs where the brute force algorithm is not feasible."
