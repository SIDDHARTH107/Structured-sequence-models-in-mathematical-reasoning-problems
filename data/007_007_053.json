    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions (x, y) for the Diophantine equation 3x + 7y = 52, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find a particular solution (x0, y0) for the equation.\n2. Use the general formula for Diophantine equations to find all other solutions.\n\nStep 1: Find a particular solution (x0, y0)\n\nWe can start by finding a solution for the equation by trial and error. We can try different integer values for x and y until we find a pair that satisfies the equation.\n\nFor example, let's try x = 4 and y = 4:\n\n3(4) + 7(4) = 12 + 28 = 40, which is not equal to 52.\n\nNow, let's try x = 6 and y = 2:\n\n3(6) + 7(2) = 18 + 14 = 32, which is not equal to 52.\n\nFinally, let's try x = 10 and y = 2:\n\n3(10) + 7(2) = 30 + 14 = 44, which is not equal to 52.\n\nNow, let's try x = 6 and y = 4:\n\n3(6) + 7(4) = 18 + 28 = 46, which is not equal to 52.\n\nFinally, let's try x = 10 and y = 3:\n\n3(10) + 7(3) = 30 + 21 = 51, which is not equal to 52.\n\nNow, let's try x = 11 and y = 3:\n\n3(11) + 7(3) = 33 + 21 = 54, which is not equal to 52.\n\nFinally, let's try x = 9 and y = 3:\n\n3(9) + 7(3) = 27 + 21 = 48, which is not equal to 52.\n\nNow, let's try x = 8 and y = 4:\n\n3(8) + 7(4) = 24 + 28 = 52, which is equal to 52.\n\nSo, we have found a particular solution (x0, y0) = (8, 4).\n\nStep 2: Use the general formula for Diophantine equations to find all other solutions\n\nThe general formula for Diophantine equations of the form ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers, and x and y are variables, is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, d = gcd(a, b), and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 7, and d = gcd(3, 7) = 1 (since 3 and 7 are coprime).\n\nSo, the general formula for our Diophantine equation is:\n\nx = 8 + 7n\ny = 4 - 3n\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions (x, y) for the equation by plugging in different integer values for n.\n\nFor example, if n = 0, we get the particular solution (x, y) = (8, 4) that we found earlier.\n\nIf n = 1, we get (x, y) = (15, 1).\n\nIf n = -1, we get (x, y) = (1, 7).\n\nAnd so on. We can generate infinitely many integer solutions (x, y) for the Diophantine equation 3x + 7y = 52 using this general formula."
