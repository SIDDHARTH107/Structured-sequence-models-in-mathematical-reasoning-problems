    "message_2": "To find the length of the opposite side, we can use the sine function in the context of right triangles. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, we have:\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nWe are given the angle (30 degrees) and the hypotenuse (13 cm). We can plug these values into the equation and solve for the opposite side:\n\nsin(30) = opposite side / 13\n\nFirst, we need to find the sine of 30 degrees. In a right triangle, sin(30) = 1/2. Now we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\n1/2 = opposite side / 13\n\nTo solve for the opposite side, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 13:\n\n(1/2) * 13 = opposite side\n\n6.5 = opposite side\n\nSo, the length of the opposite side is 6.5 cm."
