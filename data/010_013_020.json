    "message_2": "To prove that the total Chern class of a vector bundle over a compact Hausdorff space $X$ with rank $n$ is equal to $1 + c_1 + c_2 + \\cdots + c_n$, we first need to understand the definition of the Chern classes. The Chern classes are characteristic classes associated with complex vector bundles, and they are elements of the cohomology ring of the base space $X$. The total Chern class is the product of the individual Chern classes, and it is an important invariant of the vector bundle.\n\nNow, let's consider the concrete example of the unit sphere $S^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and its tangent bundle $TS^2$. The tangent bundle of $S^2$ is a rank 2 complex vector bundle, so we only need to consider the first two Chern classes, $c_1$ and $c_2$. \n\nTo compute the Chern classes, we can use the fact that the tangent bundle of $S^2$ is isomorphic to the pullback of the tautological line bundle over $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ under the Hopf map $h: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^1$. The first Chern class of the tautological line bundle over $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ is the generator of $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since the Hopf map has degree 1, the pullback of this generator under the Hopf map is the generator of $H^2(S^2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, we have $c_1(TS^2) = h^*(c_1) = 1$.\n\nThe second Chern class $c_2$ can be computed using the Whitney sum formula, which states that the total Chern class of a direct sum of two vector bundles is the product of their total Chern classes. In this case, we have $TS^2 \\oplus \\epsilon^1 \\cong \\epsilon^3$, where $\\epsilon^1$ and $\\epsilon^3$ are trivial line and rank 3 bundles, respectively. Since the total Chern class of a trivial bundle is 1, we have $(1 + c_1 + c_2)(1) = 1$, which implies that $c_2(TS^2) = 0$.\n\nThus, the total Chern class of the tangent bundle $TS^2$ is given by $1 + c_1 + c_2 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$."
