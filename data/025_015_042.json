    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 6xyz.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2 - 6yz\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2 - 6xz\n∂F/∂z = 3z^2 - 6xy\n\nNow, evaluate the partial derivatives at the point (1,1,2):\n∂F/∂x(1,1,2) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1)(2) = 3 - 12 = -9\n∂F/∂y(1,1,2) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1)(1) = 3 - 6 = -3\n∂F/∂z(1,1,2) = 3(2)^2 - 6(1)(1) = 12 - 6 = 6\n\nThe gradient of F at the point (1,1,2) is given by the vector <-9, -3, 6>.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-slope form:\nF(x, y, z) - F(1, 1, 2) = <-9, -3, 6> • <x - 1, y - 1, z - 2>\n\nPlug in F(1, 1, 2) = 1^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 - 6(1)(1)(2) = 1 + 1 + 8 - 12 = -2:\n\n(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 6xyz) - (-2) = -9(x - 1) - 3(y - 1) + 6(z - 2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 6xyz + 2 = -9x + 9 - 3y + 3 + 6z - 12\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 6xyz = -9x - 3y + 6z + 8\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1,1,2)."
