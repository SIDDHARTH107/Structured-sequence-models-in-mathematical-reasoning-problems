    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that can be constructed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration (order) of the fractal.\n\nFor the Heighway Dragon Curve, the perimeter at each order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial length * (2^(Order/2))\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the perimeter of the order 5 Heighway Dragon Curve. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^(5/2))\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^2.5)\nPerimeter = 1 * (5.656854249)\n\nThe perimeter of the order 5 Heighway Dragon Curve is approximately 5.656854249 units."
