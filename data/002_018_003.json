    "message_2": "To find the radius and volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find the side length of the cube. The formula for the volume of a cube is V = a^3, where V is the volume and a is the side length. We are given that the volume of the cube is 125 cubic cm.\n\n125 = a^3\n\nTo find the side length, we take the cube root of both sides:\n\na = ∛125 = 5 cm\n\nNow that we have the side length of the cube, we can find the diameter of the inscribed sphere. The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, which is 5 cm. Since the radius is half of the diameter, the radius of the inscribed sphere is:\n\nr = 5/2 = 2.5 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula V = (4/3)πr^3:\n\nV = (4/3)π(2.5)^3\nV ≈ (4/3)π(15.625)\nV ≈ 20.7854π\nV ≈ 65.45 cubic cm\n\nSo, the radius of the inscribed sphere is 2.5 cm, and its volume is approximately 65.45 cubic cm."
