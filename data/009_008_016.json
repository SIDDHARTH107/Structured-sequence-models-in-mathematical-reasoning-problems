    "message_1": "A string of length 8 meters is tied between two poles. One end of the string is waved up and down and creates a wave with a wavelength of 1.6 meters. If the speed of the wave is 3.2 meters per second, what is the frequency of the wave?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the wave, we can use the formula:\n\nspeed = wavelength Ã— frequency\n\nWe are given the speed (3.2 meters per second) and the wavelength (1.6 meters). We can rearrange the formula to solve for frequency:\n\nfrequency = speed / wavelength\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nfrequency = 3.2 meters per second / 1.6 meters\n\nfrequency = 2 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the wave is 2 Hz (Hertz)."
