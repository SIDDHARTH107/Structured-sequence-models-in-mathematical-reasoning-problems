    "message_2": "Let's first consider the case when ab = ba. \n\nSince a and b are non-identity elements in G, their orders must be divisors of 8. The possible orders are 2, 4, and 8. We will analyze each case.\n\nCase 1: Both a and b have order 2.\nIn this case, a^2 = b^2 = e, where e is the identity element. Then, (ab)^2 = a(ba)b = a(ab)b = a^2b^2 = e. So, ab also has order 2. Now, G has at least 4 distinct elements: e, a, b, and ab. Since G has order 8, there are 4 more elements to consider. Let's denote them as x, y, z, and w. Notice that x, y, z, and w must be products of a, b, and ab, since otherwise, we would have more than 8 elements in G. Therefore, G is closed under the operation, and since ab = ba, G is abelian.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible isomorphisms for G. If G has an element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8. If not, then every non-identity element in G has order 2, and G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nCase 2: One of a and b has order 4, without loss of generality, let |a| = 4.\nIn this case, a^4 = e, and b^2 = e. Then, (ab)^2 = a(ba)b = a(ab)b = a^2b^2 = a^2. Since a^2 ≠ e, (ab)^4 = (a^2)^2 = e, so |ab| = 4. Now, G has at least 4 distinct elements: e, a, a^2, and a^3. Since G has order 8, there are 4 more elements to consider. Let's denote them as x, y, z, and w. Notice that x, y, z, and w must be products of a, b, and ab, since otherwise, we would have more than 8 elements in G. Therefore, G is closed under the operation, and since ab = ba, G is abelian.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible isomorphisms for G. If G has an element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8. If not, then G has elements of order 2 and 4, and G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nCase 3: Both a and b have order 4.\nIn this case, a^4 = b^4 = e. Then, (ab)^2 = a(ba)b = a(ab)b = a^2b^2. Since a^2 ≠ e and b^2 ≠ e, (ab)^4 = (a^2b^2)^2 = e, so |ab| = 4. Now, G has at least 4 distinct elements: e, a, a^2, and a^3. Since G has order 8, there are 4 more elements to consider. Let's denote them as x, y, z, and w. Notice that x, y, z, and w must be products of a, b, and ab, since otherwise, we would have more than 8 elements in G.

If not, then G has elements of order 4, and G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when ab ≠ ba.\n\nIn this case, G is non-abelian. Since G has order 8, it must have a subgroup of order 4. Let H be a subgroup of G with order 4. Then, H is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If H is isomorphic to C4, then G is a semi-direct product of H and a group of order 2, which is isomorphic to D4, the dihedral group of order 8. If H is isomorphic to V4, then G is a semi-direct product of H and a group of order 2, which is also isomorphic to D4. In either case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4."
