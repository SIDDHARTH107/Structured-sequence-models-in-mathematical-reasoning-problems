    "message_2": "We can use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. Let's consider each person as a \"pigeonhole\" and the relationships between people as \"pigeons.\"\n\nFor each person, there are 5 other people they can either know or not know. We can divide these 5 people into 2 categories: people they know and people they don't know. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, for each person, there must be at least ⌈5/2⌉ = 3 people in one of these categories (either they know 3 people or they don't know 3 people).\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum number of pairs needed. We can start by selecting one person (Person A). As we established earlier, Person A must either know or not know at least 3 other people. Without loss of generality, let's assume Person A knows 3 people (Person B, Person C, and Person D). \n\nNow, we need to consider the relationships between Person B, Person C, and Person D. If any one of them knows each other (e.g., Person B knows Person C), then we have a group of 3 people who all know each other (Person A, Person B, and Person C). If none of them know each other, then we have a group of 3 people who all do not know each other (Person B, Person C, and Person D).\n\nIn either case, we have found a group of 3 people who all know each other or all do not know each other. We needed to select the pairs (A, B), (A, C), and (A, D) to guarantee this, so the minimum number of pairs needed is 3."
