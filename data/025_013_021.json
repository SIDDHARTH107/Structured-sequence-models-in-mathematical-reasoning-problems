    "message_2": "To find the order of the Jacobian variety of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible values of $x$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$ and checking if there is a corresponding $y$ value that satisfies the equation. If there is, we count the point $(x, y)$ and its reflection $(x, -y)$.\n\nLet's go through each $x$ value and find the corresponding $y$ values:\n\n1. $x = 0$: $y^2 = 0^3 + 2\\cdot0 + 1 = 1$. Since $1$ is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we have two points: $(0, 1)$ and $(0, 6)$.\n2. $x = 1$: $y^2 = 1^3 + 2\\cdot1 + 1 = 4$. Since $4$ is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we have two points: $(1, 2)$ and $(1, 5)$.\n3. $x = 2$: $y^2 = 2^3 + 2\\cdot2 + 1 = 13 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. Since $6$ is not a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, there are no points for this $x$ value.\n4. $x = 3$: $y^2 = 3^3 + 2\\cdot3 + 1 = 34 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. Since $6$ is not a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, there are no points for this $x$ value.\n5. $x = 4$: $y^2 = 4^3 + 2\\cdot4 + 1 = 73 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. Since $3$ is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we have two points: $(4, 5)$ and $(4, 2)$.\n6. $x = 5$: $y^2 = 5^3 + 2\\cdot5 + 1 = 132 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. Since $4$ is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we have two points: $(5, 2)$ and $(5, 5)$.\n7. $x = 6$: $y^2 = 6^3 + 2\\cdot6 + 1 = 223 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Since $1$ is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we have two points: $(6, 1)$ and $(6, 6)$.\n\nSo, we have a total of $2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10$ points on the curve over $\\mathbb{F}_7$. Including the point at infinity, we have $10 + 1 = 11$ points.\n\nTherefore, the order of the Jacobian variety of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ is $11$."
