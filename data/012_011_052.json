    "message_2": "Let's first understand the given information:\n\n1. The graph G has 7 vertices and 9 edges.\n2. There are 2 cut vertices in the graph. A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n3. There is 1 bridge in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nNow, let's use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have:\n\nâˆ‘(degree of vertices) = 2 * 9 = 18\n\nSince there are 2 cut vertices, let's assume they are A and B. The bridge must be connecting two components of the graph, so let's assume it connects A and B. The degree of A and B must be at least 2, as they are cut vertices.\n\nNow, let's distribute the remaining degrees among the other vertices. We have:\n\ndegree(A) + degree(B) + degree(C) + degree(D) + degree(E) + degree(F) + degree(G) = 18\ndegree(C) + degree(D) + degree(E) + degree(F) + degree(G) = 18 - degree(A) - degree(B)\n\nSince A and B are cut vertices and have at least degree 2, we can say:\n\ndegree(C) + degree(D) + degree(E) + degree(F) + degree(G) = 18 - 2 - 2 = 14\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum degree for the remaining vertices. Since the graph is connected, the minimum degree for each vertex is 1. However, this would only give a sum of 5, which is less than 14. Therefore, at least one of the remaining vertices must have a degree greater than 1.\n\nLet's assume vertex C has a degree of 2. Then, we have:\n\ndegree(D) + degree(E) + degree(F) + degree(G) = 14 - 2 = 12\n\nNow, we can distribute the remaining degrees among vertices D, E, F, and G. Since the minimum degree for each vertex is 1, we can assign a degree of 3 to each of them:\n\ndegree(D) = 3\ndegree(E) = 3\ndegree(F) = 3\ndegree(G) = 3\n\nNow, we have the degrees of all vertices:\n\ndegree(A) = 2\ndegree(B) = 2\ndegree(C) = 2\ndegree(D) = 3\ndegree(E) = 3\ndegree(F) = 3\ndegree(G) = 3\n\nThese degrees satisfy the Handshaking Lemma and the given conditions of the problem."
