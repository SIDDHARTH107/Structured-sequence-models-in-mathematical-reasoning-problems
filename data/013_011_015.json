    "message_1": "Suppose there are two gas stations located in the same neighborhood. The cost of producing a gallon of gasoline is $1.50 for both gas stations. Gas Station A decides to sell gasoline at a price of $3 per gallon. What is the minimum price Gas Station B can sell gasoline for if it wants to attract all customers in the neighborhood and maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To attract all customers in the neighborhood and maximize its profit, Gas Station B needs to sell gasoline at a price slightly lower than Gas Station A. Since Gas Station A is selling gasoline at $3 per gallon, Gas Station B can sell gasoline at a minimum price of $2.99 per gallon. This way, it will still make a profit of $1.49 per gallon ($2.99 - $1.50) and attract all customers due to the lower price compared to Gas Station A."
