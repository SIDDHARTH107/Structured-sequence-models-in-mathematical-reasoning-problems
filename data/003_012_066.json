    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem on finding the angle of elevation or depression:\n\nA person standing on the ground sees the top of a tower at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees. The person then moves 30 meters closer to the tower and sees the top of the tower at an angle of elevation of 75 degrees. What is the height of the tower?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the tower as h, the initial distance from the person to the tower as d, and the distance after moving 30 meters closer as d-30.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the height and distance:\n\ntan(angle) = height / distance\n\nFrom the initial position:\n\ntan(60°) = h / d\n√3 = h / d  (since tan(60°) = √3)\n\nFrom the position after moving 30 meters closer:\n\ntan(75°) = h / (d - 30)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (h and d):\n\n1) √3 = h / d\n2) tan(75°) = h / (d - 30)\n\nWe can solve for h in the first equation:\n\nh = √3 * d\n\nNow substitute this expression for h in the second equation:\n\ntan(75°) = (√3 * d) / (d - 30)\n\nNow we can solve for d:\n\nd - 30 = (√3 * d) / tan(75°)\n\nd * tan(75°) - 30 * tan(75°) = √3 * d\n\nd * (tan(75°) - √3) = 30 * tan(75°)\n\nd = (30 * tan(75°)) / (tan(75°) - √3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nd ≈ 60.94 meters\n\nNow we can find the height of the tower using the expression for h:\n\nh = √3 * d\nh ≈ √3 * 60.94\nh ≈ 105.56 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tower is approximately 105.56 meters."
