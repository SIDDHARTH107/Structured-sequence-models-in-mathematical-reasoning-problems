    "message_2": "The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$R_0 = \\frac{\\text{transmission rate}}{\\text{recovery rate}}$\n\nIn this case, the transmission rate is 0.05 per day, and the recovery rate is 0.8 per day. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$R_0 = \\frac{0.05}{0.8} = 0.0625$\n\nSo, the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) for this disease is 0.0625."
