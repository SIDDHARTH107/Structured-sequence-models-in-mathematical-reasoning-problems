    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation with the given boundary and initial conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = k^2X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = k^2\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = -\\lambda$\n\n$k^2\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n$T''(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$\n\n$k^2X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nWe first solve the equation for $X(x)$. The boundary conditions are:\n\n$X(0) = 0$\n\n$X(L) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}x) + B\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$X(0) = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = B = 0$\n\n$X(L) = A\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}L) = A\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$\n\nSince $X(x)$ is non-trivial, $A \\neq 0$, and we must have $n\\pi = 0$ or $n\\pi = 2m\\pi$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $n = 2m$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, ...$. So, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\frac{2m\\pi}{L}x)$\n\nNow, we solve the equation for $T(t)$. Since $\\lambda = k^2(\\frac{2m\\pi}{L})^2$, the equation becomes:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2(\\frac{2m\\pi}{L})^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(k\\frac{2m\\pi}{L}t) + D\\sin(k\\frac{2m\\pi}{L}t)$\n\nThe initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$ implies that $D = 0$. Thus, the solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(k\\frac{2m\\pi}{L}t)$\n\nNow, we combine the solutions for $X(x)$ and $T(t)$:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = AC\\sin(\\frac{2m\\pi}{L}x)\\cos(k\\frac{2m\\pi}{L}t)$\n\nTo satisfy the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{L}x)$, we must have $m = 1$ and $AC = 1$. Thus, the solution for $u(x,t)$ is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}x)\\cos(k\\frac{2\\pi}{L}t)$"
