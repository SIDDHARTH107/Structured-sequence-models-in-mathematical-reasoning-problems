    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the perimeter is 2 units (the original line segment plus one more of the same length). With each subsequent iteration, the perimeter doubles. So, after the 8th iteration, the perimeter will be:\n\nPerimeter = Initial length × 2^(Number of iterations)\nPerimeter = 1 × 2^8\nPerimeter = 1 × 256\nPerimeter = 256 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after the 8th iteration is 256 units."
