    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, the probability that a burglary will occur in a day is 0.08, and the probability that a robbery will occur in a day is 0.05. What is the probability that neither a burglary nor a robbery will occur in a day in this neighborhood?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that neither a burglary nor a robbery will occur in a day, we first need to find the probability that either a burglary or a robbery will occur. We can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nHowever, we don't have the information about the probability of both a burglary and a robbery occurring on the same day (P(A ∩ B)). We will assume that the events are independent, meaning the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event. In this case, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\n\nPlugging in the given probabilities:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.08 + 0.05 - (0.08)(0.05) = 0.08 + 0.05 - 0.004 = 0.126\n\nNow, to find the probability that neither event occurs, we can subtract the probability of either event occurring from 1:\n\nP(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A ∪ B) = 1 - 0.126 = 0.874\n\nSo, the probability that neither a burglary nor a robbery will occur in a day in this neighborhood is 0.874."
