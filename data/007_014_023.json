    "message_2": "To find the next even perfect number following 8,128, we need to find the next prime number p for which 2^(p-1) x (2^p - 1) results in an even perfect number.\n\nWe know that 8,128 is an even perfect number and it is formed by the formula 2^(p-1) x (2^p - 1) with p = 7 (since 2^(7-1) x (2^7 - 1) = 64 x 127 = 8,128).\n\nNow, we need to find the next prime number after 7, which is 11. Let's plug p = 11 into the formula:\n\n2^(11-1) x (2^11 - 1) = 2^10 x (2^11 - 1) = 1024 x (2048 - 1) = 1024 x 2047 = 2,097,152\n\nThus, the next even perfect number following 8,128 is 2,097,152."
