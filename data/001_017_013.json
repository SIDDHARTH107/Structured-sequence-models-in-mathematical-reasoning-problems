    "message_2": "To solve the equation log₂(x+5) - log₂(x) = 1, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can combine the two logarithms using the quotient rule, which states that log₂(a) - log₂(b) = log₂(a/b). In this case, we have:\n\nlog₂((x+5)/x) = 1\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form. The equation log₂(y) = x is equivalent to 2^x = y. So, we have:\n\n2^1 = (x+5)/x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2 = (x+5)/x\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by x:\n\n2x = x + 5\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the equation log₂(x+5) - log₂(x) = 1 is x = 5."
