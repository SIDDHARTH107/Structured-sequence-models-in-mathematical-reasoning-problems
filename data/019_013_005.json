    "message_2": "In set theory, the number of subsets that can be formed from a set with n elements is given by the power set formula, which is 2^n. In this case, n = 5, so the maximum number of subsets that can be formed from a set with 5 elements is 2^5 = 32. This holds true in second-order logic as well, as the number of subsets is a combinatorial property and does not depend on the logic used."
