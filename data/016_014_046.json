    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of √2. \n\nAfter three iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\nOriginal length × (√2)^3\n\n1 × (√2)^3 = 1 × 2^(3/2) = 1 × 2^(1.5) ≈ 2.828\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after three iterations is approximately 2.828."
