    "message_2": "The logistic map is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nxₙ₊₁ = r * xₙ * (1 - xₙ)\n\nwhere xₙ is the population at time n, r is a parameter, and xₙ₊₁ is the population at time n+1.\n\nGiven r = 3.8 and x₀ = 0.6, we can calculate the first four periods (x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄) as follows:\n\nx₁ = 3.8 * 0.6 * (1 - 0.6) = 3.8 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.912\nx₂ = 3.8 * 0.912 * (1 - 0.912) = 3.8 * 0.912 * 0.088 = 0.305664\nx₃ = 3.8 * 0.305664 * (1 - 0.305664) = 3.8 * 0.305664 * 0.694336 = 0.809053696\nx₄ = 3.8 * 0.809053696 * (1 - 0.809053696) = 3.8 * 0.809053696 * 0.190946304 = 0.588982927\n\nSo, the approximate values of the first four periods of the logistic map are:\n\nx₁ ≈ 0.912\nx₂ ≈ 0.305664\nx₃ ≈ 0.809053696\nx₄ ≈ 0.588982927"
