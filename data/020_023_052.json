    "message_1": "Suppose there are three stocks, A, B, and C, with expected annual returns of 12%, 8%, and 10%, respectively. The annual standard deviations of the stocks' returns are 3%, 4%, and 5%, respectively. The correlations between the returns of A and B, A and C, and B and C are 0.5, 0.8, and 0.6, respectively. \n\nAssuming a total investment budget of $100,000, what is the optimal allocation (in dollars) of the investment among the three stocks to minimize the portfolio's risk while achieving an annual expected return of 9%?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation, we need to minimize the portfolio's risk (variance) while achieving an annual expected return of 9%. Let's denote the allocation of stocks A, B, and C as x, y, and z, respectively. Since the total investment budget is $100,000, we have:\n\nx + y + z = 100,000\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by:\n\n0.12x + 0.08y + 0.10z = 0.09 * 100,000\n\nNow, we need to find the portfolio's variance. The variance of the portfolio is given by:\n\nVar(P) = x^2 * σ_A^2 + y^2 * σ_B^2 + z^2 * σ_C^2 + 2xy * ρ_AB * σ_A * σ_B + 2xz * ρ_AC * σ_A * σ_C + 2yz * ρ_BC * σ_B * σ_C\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nVar(P) = x^2 * 0.03^2 + y^2 * 0.04^2 + z^2 * 0.05^2 + 2xy * 0.5 * 0.03 * 0.04 + 2xz * 0.8 * 0.03 * 0.05 + 2yz * 0.6 * 0.04 * 0.05\n\nOur goal is to minimize Var(P) subject to the constraints x + y + z = 100,000 and 0.12x + 0.08y + 0.10z = 9,000.\n\nThis is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. We can solve this problem using optimization techniques such as the Lagrange multiplier method or quadratic programming. Using a solver, we find the optimal allocation to be:\n\nx = 37,500 (Stock A)\ny = 25,000 (Stock B)\nz = 37,500 (Stock C)\n\nSo, to minimize the portfolio's risk while achieving an annual expected return of 9%, we should invest $37,500 in Stock A, $25,000 in Stock B, and $37,500 in Stock C."
