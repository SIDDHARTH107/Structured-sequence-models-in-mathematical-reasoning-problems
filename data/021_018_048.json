    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to the subtopic of solving optimization problems using tabu search:\n\nA company wants to optimize its production process for two products X and Y. The profit per unit for product X is $10 and for product Y is $8. The production process requires two types of machines A and B. Each unit of product X requires 2 hours of machine A and 1 hour of machine B, while each unit of product Y requires 1 hour of machine A and 1 hour of machine B. The company has a total of 100 hours of machine A and 80 hours of machine B available per week. Assuming the company wants to maximize its profit, use tabu search algorithm to find the optimal production quantities for product X and Y that the company should produce per week.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the tabu search algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function is the profit function, which is given by P(x, y) = 10x + 8y, where x is the number of units of product X and y is the number of units of product Y.\n\n2. Define the constraints: The constraints are given by the machine hours available for machines A and B:\n   2x + y ≤ 100 (Machine A constraint)\n   x + y ≤ 80 (Machine B constraint)\n\n3. Initialize the tabu search algorithm: Set an initial solution (x0, y0), tabu list size, and stopping criteria (e.g., maximum number of iterations).\n\n4. Generate neighborhood solutions: Generate a set of neighboring solutions by modifying the current solution (x, y) within the constraints.\n\n5. Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution and choose the best solution that is not in the tabu list.\n\n6. Update the tabu list: Add the chosen solution to the tabu list and remove the oldest solution if the list exceeds the specified size.\n\n7. Check the stopping criteria: If the stopping criteria are met, stop the algorithm and return the best solution found so far. Otherwise, go back to step 4.\n\nApplying the tabu search algorithm to this problem, we can find the optimal production quantities for product X and Y that maximize the company's profit. The optimal solution will be x = 20 units of product X and y = 60 units of product Y, with a maximum profit of $760 per week."
