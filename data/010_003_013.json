    "message_2": "To show that X is a Hausdorff space, we need to show that for any two distinct points a and b in X, there exist open sets U and V such that a ∈ U, b ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. This is given in the problem statement, so X is indeed a Hausdorff space.\n\nNow, we will prove that a topological space X is a Hausdorff space if and only if for every point x, the intersection of all neighborhoods of x is equal to {x}.\n\n(⇒) Suppose X is a Hausdorff space. Let x be any point in X, and let N be the intersection of all neighborhoods of x. We want to show that N = {x}. Since x is in every neighborhood of x, x ∈ N. Now, let y be any point in X such that y ≠ x. Since X is Hausdorff, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. Since U is an open set containing x, it is a neighborhood of x. Therefore, U contains N, which implies that N ⊆ U. Since U ∩ V = ∅, it follows that y ∉ N. Thus, N = {x}.\n\n(⇐) Suppose that for every point x in X, the intersection of all neighborhoods of x is equal to {x}. Let a and b be two distinct points in X. Let Na and Nb be the intersection of all neighborhoods of a and b, respectively. Then Na = {a} and Nb = {b}. Since a ≠ b, there exists a neighborhood U of a and a neighborhood V of b such that U ∩ V = ∅. This is because if U ∩ V ≠ ∅, then there would be a point in both Na and Nb, which contradicts the fact that Na = {a} and Nb = {b}. Thus, X is a Hausdorff space.\n\nIn conclusion, a topological space X is a Hausdorff space if and only if for every point x, the intersection of all neighborhoods of x is equal to {x}."
