    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 4 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3)π(4³)\nV = (4/3)π(64)\nV = (256/3)π\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 4 cm is approximately 268.08 cubic centimeters."
