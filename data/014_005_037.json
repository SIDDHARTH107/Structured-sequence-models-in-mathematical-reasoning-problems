    "message_1": "A message is digitally signed using RSA digital signatures. The public modulus is n = 85 and the public exponent is e = 11. The signature on the message is s = 3. Determine the value of the private exponent d.",
    "message_2": "To find the private exponent d, we first need to find the totient of the modulus n (denoted as φ(n)). Since n = 85, we need to find the prime factors of 85, which are 5 and 17. Now we can calculate φ(n):\n\nφ(n) = (5 - 1)(17 - 1) = 4 * 16 = 64\n\nNow we need to find the modular inverse of e (11) with respect to φ(n) (64). In other words, we need to find a value for d such that:\n\nd * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n\nd * 11 ≡ 1 (mod 64)\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse:\n\n1. Initialize two series of variables: (r0, r1) = (64, 11), (t0, t1) = (0, 1)\n2. Calculate the quotient and remainder: q = r0 // r1 = 5, r2 = r0 % r1 = 9\n3. Update the series: (r0, r1, r2) = (11, 9, 9), (t0, t1) = (1, -5)\n4. Calculate the quotient and remainder: q = r1 // r2 = 1, r3 = r1 % r2 = 2\n5. Update the series: (r1, r2, r3) = (9, 2, 2), (t1, t2) = (-5, 6)\n6. Calculate the quotient and remainder: q = r2 // r3 = 4, r4 = r2 % r3 = 1\n7. Update the series: (r2, r3, r4) = (2, 1, 1), (t2, t3) = (6, -29)\n8. Since r4 = 1, the algorithm stops, and the modular inverse is t3 = -29\n\nHowever, we need a positive value for the private exponent d. We can find it by adding φ(n) to the modular inverse:\n\nd = -29 + 64 = 35\n\nSo, the private exponent d is 35."
