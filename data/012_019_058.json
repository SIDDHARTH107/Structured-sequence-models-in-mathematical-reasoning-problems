    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In other words, it is the minimum number of colors required for an edge coloring of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph G, denoted by Δ(G). Since G has 7 vertices and 10 edges, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 10) / 7 ≈ 2.86. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 3.\n\nNow, let's use Vizing's theorem, which states that for any simple, undirected graph G, the chromatic index χ'(G) is either Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1. In other words, χ'(G) ∈ {Δ(G), Δ(G) + 1}.\n\nSince Δ(G) is at least 3, we have two possibilities for the chromatic index: χ'(G) ∈ {3, 4}.\n\nNow, let's try to determine if it is possible to color the edges of G with 3 colors. If G has a vertex with degree 4, then it is not possible to color the edges with only 3 colors, as each of the 4 edges incident to that vertex would require a different color. In this case, the chromatic index would be 4.\n\nHowever, if the maximum degree Δ(G) is exactly 3, then it is possible to color the edges of G with 3 colors. In this case, the chromatic index would be 3.\n\nWithout more information about the specific structure of G, we cannot determine the exact chromatic index. However, we can conclude that the chromatic index χ'(G) is either 3 or 4."
