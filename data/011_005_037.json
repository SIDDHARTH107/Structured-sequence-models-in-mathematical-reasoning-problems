    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct arrangements of 5 letters from the word \"COMBINATORICS,\" we need to consider the number of unique letters and their repetitions.\n\nThe word \"COMBINATORICS\" has 13 letters, with the following frequency of each letter:\n\nC - 2 times\nO - 2 times\nM - 1 time\nB - 1 time\nI - 2 times\nN - 1 time\nA - 1 time\nT - 1 time\nR - 1 time\nS - 1 time\n\nThere are 9 unique letters in total. We need to choose 5 letters from these 9 unique letters. This can be done in 9C5 ways, which is calculated as:\n\n9C5 = 9! / (5! * (9-5)!)\n= 9! / (5! * 4!)\n= (9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 126\n\nSo, there are 126 ways to choose 5 distinct letters from the 9 unique letters.\n\nNow, we need to consider the repetitions of the letters C, O, and I. Since we are choosing 5 letters, there can be at most one repetition of any letter. We have 3 cases to consider:\n\n1. No repetitions: In this case, we simply choose 5 distinct letters, which we have already calculated as 126 ways.\n\n2. One repetition of C: We have 4 remaining spots to fill with distinct letters from the remaining 8 unique letters (excluding C). This can be done in 8C4 ways:\n\n8C4 = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\n= 8! / (4! * 4!)\n= (8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 70\n\n3. One repetition of O: Similar to the case with C, we have 4 remaining spots to fill with distinct letters from the remaining 8 unique letters (excluding O). This can also be done in 8C4 ways, which is 70.\n\n4. One repetition of I: Again, similar to the cases with C and O, we have 4 remaining spots to fill with distinct letters from the remaining 8 unique letters (excluding I). This can also be done in 8C4 ways, which is 70.\n\nNow, we add up the number of ways for each case:\n\nTotal arrangements = No repetitions + One repetition of C + One repetition of O + One repetition of I\n= 126 + 70 + 70 + 70\n= 336\n\nTherefore, there are 336 distinct arrangements of 5 letters that can be formed from the letters in the word \"COMBINATORICS.\""
