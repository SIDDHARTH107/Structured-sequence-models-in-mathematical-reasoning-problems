    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation, we can first try to find a general solution without considering the boundary conditions. We can rewrite the given PDE as:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} + 9\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} - 4\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x \\partial y} - e^{2x+3y} = 0$\n\nNow, let's make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let $v(x, y) = e^{-2x-3y}u(x, y)$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -2e^{-2x-3y}u + e^{-2x-3y}u_x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} = 4e^{-2x-3y}u - 4e^{-2x-3y}u_x + e^{-2x-3y}u_{xx}$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -3e^{-2x-3y}u + e^{-2x-3y}u_y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} = 9e^{-2x-3y}u - 6e^{-2x-3y}u_y + e^{-2x-3y}u_{yy}$\n\nAnd,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 6e^{-2x-3y}u - 2e^{-2x-3y}u_x - 3e^{-2x-3y}u_y + e^{-2x-3y}u_{xy}$\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the original PDE:\n\n$e^{-2x-3y}u_{xx} + 9e^{-2x-3y}u_{yy} - 4e^{-2x-3y}u_{xy} - e^{2x+3y} = 0$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$u_{xx} + 9u_{yy} - 4u_{xy} = 1$\n\nNow, we have a simpler PDE to solve:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} + 9\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} - 4\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 1$\n\nTo find the general solution to this PDE, we can use the method of characteristics. However, this method is quite involved and may not lead to a closed-form solution. Alternatively, we can try to find a particular solution to the PDE and then use the boundary conditions to find the coefficients of the general solution. Unfortunately, finding a closed-form solution for this PDE with the given boundary conditions is very challenging and may not be possible."
