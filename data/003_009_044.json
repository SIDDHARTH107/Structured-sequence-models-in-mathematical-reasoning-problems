    "message_2": "Using trigonometry to find the perimeter of the triangle is not the most efficient method, as the perimeter is simply the sum of the lengths of all sides. However, we can still use trigonometry to verify that this is a valid triangle and then find the perimeter.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle as a = 10m, b = 13m, and c = 15m. We can use the Cosine Rule to verify that this is a valid triangle:\n\nCosine Rule: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to find the cosine of angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\ncos(C) = (10^2 + 13^2 - 15^2) / (2 * 10 * 13)\ncos(C) = (100 + 169 - 225) / 260\ncos(C) = 44 / 260\ncos(C) â‰ˆ 0.1692\n\nSince the cosine of angle C is between -1 and 1, this is a valid triangle.\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter by simply adding the lengths of all sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 10m + 13m + 15m\nPerimeter = 38m\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is 38 meters."
