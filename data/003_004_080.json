    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) = cos(x), we can use the fact that sin(x) = cos(90° - x) or sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x) in radians.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nsin(x) = cos(π/2 - x)\n\nNow, we can set x = π/2 - x:\n\nx = π/2 - x\n\nAdding x to both sides, we get:\n\n2x = π/2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = π/4\n\nHowever, this is not the only solution. Since sine and cosine functions are periodic, we can find other solutions by adding multiples of their period. The period of sine and cosine functions is 2π, so we can add 2πk to our solution, where k is an integer:\n\nx = π/4 + 2πk\n\nSo, the general solution for x is:\n\nx = π/4 + 2πk, where k is an integer."
