    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the given function, we first need to determine the period of the function. Since the function is defined piecewise over the interval [0, 2], the period is T = 2.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ[an*cos(nπx/T) + bn*sin(nπx/T)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nWe can find the coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(x)]dx over [0, T]\nan = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/T)]dx over [0, T]\nbn = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/T)]dx over [0, T]\n\nFirst, let's find a0:\n\na0 = (1/2) * [∫(2x dx) from 0 to 1 + ∫(2(2-x) dx) from 1 to 2]\na0 = (1/2) * [(x^2) | from 0 to 1 + (2x - x^2) | from 1 to 2]\na0 = (1/2) * [(1 - 0) + (2(2) - 2^2) - (2(1) - 1^2)]\na0 = (1/2) * [1 + 0]\na0 = 1/2\n\nNow, let's find an:\n\nan = (1/2) * [∫(2x * cos(nπx) dx) from 0 to 1 + ∫(2(2-x) * cos(nπx) dx) from 1 to 2]\n\nTo solve these integrals, we'll need to use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 2x, dv = cos(nπx) dx for the first integral, and u = 2(2-x), dv = cos(nπx) dx for the second integral.\n\nThen, du = 2 dx, v = (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) for the first integral, and du = -2 dx, v = (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) for the second integral.\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\nan = (1/2) * [(2x * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - ∫(2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) dx) from 0 to 1 + (2(2-x) * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) + ∫(2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) dx) from 1 to 2]\n\nan = (1/2) * [(2x * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - (2/nπ) * ∫(sin(nπx) dx) from 0 to 1 + (2(2-x) * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) + (2/nπ) * ∫(sin(nπx) dx) from 1 to 2]\n\nNow, integrate sin(nπx) with respect to x:\n\n∫(sin(nπx) dx) = (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nPlug this back into the expression for an:\n\nan = (1/2) * [(2x * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - (2/nπ) * (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx) from 0 to 1 + (2(2-x) * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) + (2/nπ) * (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx) from 1 to 2]\n\nan = (1/2) * [(2x * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) + (2/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx) from 0 to 1 + (2(2-x) * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) - (2/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx) from 1 to 2]\n\nNow, evaluate the limits:\n\nan = (1/2) * [(2 - (2/n^2π^2) + (2/n^2π^2) - 2)]\n\nan = 0\n\nNext, let's find bn:\n\nbn = (1/2) * [∫(2x * sin(nπx) dx) from 0 to 1 + ∫(2(2-x) * sin(nπx) dx) from 1 to 2]\n\nUsing the same integration by parts method as before:\n\nbn = (1/2) * [(2x * (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx) - (2/nπ) * ∫(-cos(nπx) dx) from 0 to 1 + (2(2-x) * (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx) + (2/nπ) * ∫(-cos(nπx) dx) from 1 to 2]\n\nNow, integrate -cos(nπx) with respect to x:\n\n∫(-cos(nπx) dx) = (-1/nπ) * sin(nπx)\n\nPlug this back into the expression for bn:\n\nbn = (1/2) * [(2x * (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx) + (2/n^2π^2) * sin(nπx) from 0 to 1 + (2(2-x) * (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx) - (2/n^2π^2) * sin(nπx) from 1 to 2]\n\nNow, evaluate the limits:\n\nbn = (1/2) * [(-2/nπ) + (2/n^2π^2) - (-2/nπ) - (2/n^2π^2)]\n\nbn = (2/nπ) - (2/n^2π^2)\n\nNow, we have all the coefficients, so we can write the Fourier series representation of the function:\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ[((2/nπ) - (2/n^2π^2)) * sin(nπx)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function."
