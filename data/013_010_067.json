    "message_1": "Consider a market with two firms that produce identical goods according to the Cournot model. The total cost function of each firm is given by C(q_i) = 4q_i, where q_i is the quantity produced by i-th firm, and the market demand function is P = 60 - Q, where Q = q_1 + q_2 is the total quantity of production. What is the Nash Equilibrium quantity of production for each firm and the market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium quantity of production for each firm and the market price, we first need to find the profit function for each firm and then find the reaction functions. Finally, we will solve the reaction functions simultaneously to find the Nash Equilibrium.\n\nThe profit function for each firm is given by:\n\nπ_i = P * q_i - C(q_i)\n\nSubstitute the demand function and cost function:\n\nπ_i = (60 - Q) * q_i - 4q_i\n\nπ_i = (60 - (q_1 + q_2)) * q_i - 4q_i\n\nFor firm 1:\n\nπ_1 = (60 - (q_1 + q_2)) * q_1 - 4q_1\n\nFor firm 2:\n\nπ_2 = (60 - (q_1 + q_2)) * q_2 - 4q_2\n\nNow, we need to find the reaction functions by taking the first-order derivative of the profit functions with respect to the respective quantities and setting them equal to zero.\n\nFor firm 1:\n\ndπ_1/dq_1 = 60 - 2q_1 - q_2 - 4 = 0\n\n2q_1 + q_2 = 56 (1)\n\nFor firm 2:\n\ndπ_2/dq_2 = 60 - q_1 - 2q_2 - 4 = 0\n\nq_1 + 2q_2 = 56 (2)\n\nNow, we need to solve equations (1) and (2) simultaneously to find the Nash Equilibrium quantities.\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express q_2 in terms of q_1:\n\nq_2 = 56 - 2q_1\n\nSubstitute this expression into equation (2):\n\nq_1 + 2(56 - 2q_1) = 56\n\nq_1 + 112 - 4q_1 = 56\n\n3q_1 = -56 + 112\n\n3q_1 = 56\n\nq_1 = 56/3 ≈ 18.67\n\nNow, substitute q_1 back into the expression for q_2:\n\nq_2 = 56 - 2(56/3)\n\nq_2 = 56 - 112/3\n\nq_2 = 56/3 ≈ 18.67\n\nSo, the Nash Equilibrium quantity of production for each firm is q_1 = q_2 ≈ 18.67.\n\nNow, we can find the market price by substituting the equilibrium quantities into the demand function:\n\nP = 60 - Q\n\nP = 60 - (q_1 + q_2)\n\nP = 60 - (18.67 + 18.67)\n\nP = 60 - 37.34\n\nP ≈ 22.66\n\nThus, the Nash Equilibrium market price is approximately $22.66."
