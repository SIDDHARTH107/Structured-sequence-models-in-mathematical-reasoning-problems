    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 60: 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of abelian groups of order 60 using the formula: a(n) = p(n1) * p(n2) * ... * p(nk), where p(n) is the number of partitions of n and n1, n2, ..., nk are the exponents in the prime factorization of the group order. In this case, a(60) = p(2) * p(1) * p(1) = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2.\n3. Determine the total number of groups of order 60 using the formula: g(n) = SUM[ d(n) * a(n/d) ], where d(n) is the number of divisors of n and a(n/d) is the number of abelian groups of order n/d. In this case, g(60) = 1 * a(60) + 2 * a(30) + 2 * a(20) + 4 * a(15) + 4 * a(12) + 6 * a(10) + 12 * a(5) + 12 * a(4) + 20 * a(3) + 60 * a(1) = 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 4 + 4 * 2 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 4 + 12 * 2 + 12 * 3 + 20 * 1 + 60 * 1 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 20 + 24 + 24 + 36 + 20 + 60 = 206.\n4. Subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups to find the number of non-abelian groups: 206 - 2 = 204.\n\nSo, there are 204 non-abelian groups of order 60."
