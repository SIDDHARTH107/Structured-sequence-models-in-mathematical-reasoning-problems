    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal curve that can be constructed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The order of the curve, n, represents the number of times the paper has been folded.\n\nFor each iteration (order) of the Heighway Dragon Curve, the number of line segments doubles. Starting with a single line segment at order 0, we can calculate the total number of line segments at order n as 2^n.\n\nSince each line segment has a length of 1 unit, the total length of the curve at order n is equal to the number of line segments, which is 2^n units."
