    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski pyramid construction, the number of small equilateral triangles increases by a factor of 4 with each iteration. To find the total number of small equilateral triangles in the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = a * (r^(n-1))\n\nwhere a is the initial number of triangles (in this case, 1), r is the common ratio (in this case, 4), and n is the number of iterations (in this case, 5).\n\nTotal triangles = 1 * (4^(5-1))\nTotal triangles = 1 * (4^4)\nTotal triangles = 1 * 256\n\nSo, there are 256 small equilateral triangles in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid construction."
