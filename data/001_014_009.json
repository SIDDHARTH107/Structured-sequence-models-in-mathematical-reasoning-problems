    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(75), we need to find the prime factors of 75 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n75 = 3 × 25\n25 = 5 × 5\n\nSo, 75 = 3 × 5 × 5\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by taking out the pair of 5s:\n\n√(75) = √(3 × 5 × 5) = 5√(3)\n\nThe simplified radical expression is 5√(3)."
