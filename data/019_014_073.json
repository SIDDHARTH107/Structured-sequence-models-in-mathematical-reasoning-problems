    "message_1": "Let's say there are 10 people in a room. Each person has a number from 1 to 10 written on their forehead, but they cannot see their own number. Higher-order logic allows us to reason about predicates, which are properties that may apply to objects or sets of objects. \n\nThe question for the math student is: Using higher-order logic and predicates, what is the minimum number of yes/no questions that can be asked, where the answers are based solely on the responses of the other nine people, to determine the number on their own forehead?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number on their own forehead with the minimum number of yes/no questions, a person can use a binary search strategy. This involves asking questions that divide the remaining possibilities in half each time.\n\n1. First question: \"Is my number greater than 5?\"\n   - If the answer is yes, the person knows their number is between 6 and 10.\n   - If the answer is no, the person knows their number is between 1 and 5.\n\n2. Second question: \"Is my number greater than X?\" (where X is the midpoint of the remaining possibilities)\n   - If the answer is yes, the person knows their number is in the upper half of the remaining possibilities.\n   - If the answer is no, the person knows their number is in the lower half of the remaining possibilities.\n\nThe person continues asking questions in this manner, narrowing down the possibilities until they can determine their number.\n\nSince there are 10 possibilities (numbers 1 to 10), the minimum number of yes/no questions needed to determine the number on their own forehead is 4. This is because 2^4 = 16, which is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 10."
