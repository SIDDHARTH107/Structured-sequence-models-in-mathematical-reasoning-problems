    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we are given the population mean (μ) as 170cm and the population standard deviation (σ) as 7cm. We are also given the sample size (n) as 25 people.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean), which is calculated as:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nσ_sample_mean = 7 / √25\nσ_sample_mean = 7 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 1.4cm\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the given sample mean (165cm). The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nz = (165 - 170) / 1.4\nz = -5 / 1.4\nz ≈ -3.57\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the average height of the sample will be less than 165cm, which corresponds to the area to the left of the z-score in the standard normal distribution table. \n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability for a z-score of -3.57 is approximately 0.0002 (or 0.02%).\n\nSo, the probability that the average height of the sample will be less than 165cm is approximately 0.02%."
