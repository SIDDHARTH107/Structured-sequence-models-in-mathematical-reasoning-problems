    "message_2": "We will prove this using mathematical induction.\n\nBase case (n = 1): \nThe sum of the first odd number is 1, and 1 squared is also 1. So, the statement holds true for n = 1.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume that the statement is true for some natural number k, i.e., the sum of the first k odd numbers is equal to k^2. We will show that the statement is also true for k + 1.\n\nSum of the first k odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k^2 (by our assumption)\n\nNow, we will find the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers:\n\nSum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1)\n\nUsing our assumption, we can rewrite this as:\n\nSum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers = k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\nSum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers = k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1)\n                                      = k^2 + 2k + 1\n                                      = (k + 1)^2\n\nThus, the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers is equal to (k + 1)^2.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n."
