    "message_2": "A Menger Sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In the construction of a Menger Sponge, we start with a level 0 sponge, which is just a single cube. For each subsequent level, we divide each face of the cube into a 3x3 grid and remove the center cube of each face, as well as the cube in the very center of the larger cube. This results in 20 smaller cubes remaining at each level.\n\nFor a level 4 Menger Sponge, we can calculate the total number of cubes as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 20 cubes (20^1)\nLevel 2: 20^2 = 400 cubes\nLevel 3: 20^3 = 8,000 cubes\nLevel 4: 20^4 = 160,000 cubes\n\nSo, the total number of cubes in a level 4 Menger Sponge is 160,000 cubes."
