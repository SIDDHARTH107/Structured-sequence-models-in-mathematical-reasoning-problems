The dataset includes the number of times each customer shopped at the store and the total amount spent by each customer during the month. The mean number of times each customer shopped at the store in June was 7, with a standard deviation of 3. The mean amount spent per customer during the month was $100, with a standard deviation of $20. Using this information, what is the probability that a randomly selected customer spent more than $150 during the month of June, given that they shopped at the store at least 10 times?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the Z-score for normal distribution.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability that a customer shopped at the store at least 10 times. We can use the Z-score formula for this:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the number of times a customer shopped, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. In this case, X = 10, μ = 7, and σ = 3.\n\nZ = (10 - 7) / 3 = 1\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a customer shopped at least 10 times using the Z-score table or a calculator. The probability for Z = 1 is 0.8413. Since we want the probability of at least 10 times, we need to consider the right tail of the distribution, so the probability is:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that a customer spent more than $150, given that they shopped at least 10 times. We can use the Z-score formula again, but this time for the amount spent:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the amount spent, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. In this case, X = 150, μ = 100, and σ = 20.\n\nZ = (150 - 100) / 20 = 2.5\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a customer spent more than $150 using the Z-score table or a calculator. The probability for Z = 2.5 is 0.9938. Since we want the probability of more than $150, we need to consider the right tail of the distribution, so the probability is:\n\nP(X > 150) = 1 - 0.9938 = 0.0062\n\nNow, we can use the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, A is the event that a customer spent more than $150, and B is the event that a customer shopped at least 10 times. We want to find P(A | B), the probability that a customer spent more than $150 given that they shopped at least 10 times.\n\nWe don't have enough information to find P(A ∩ B) directly, but we can make an assumption that the number of times a customer shopped and the amount spent are independent events. If they are independent, then:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nP(A | B) = (P(A) * P(B)) / P(B)\n\nP(A | B) = (0.0062 * 0.1587) / 0.1587\n\nP(A | B) = 0.0062\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected customer spent more than $150 during the month of June, given that they shopped at the store at least 10 times, is approximately 0.62%."
