    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products, X and Y. Each unit of X requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while each unit of Y requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. The company has an available labor of 240 hours and an available machine time of 150 hours. If the company earns a profit of $5 per unit of X and $7 per unit of Y, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of X and Y to produce, given the constraints on labor and machine time. We can set up a linear programming problem to solve this.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize): P = 5x + 7y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 240 (total labor hours available)\n2. Machine time constraint: 2x + y ≤ 150 (total machine hours available)\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y = 240 → y = (240 - 3x) / 2\n2. 2x + y = 150 → y = 150 - 2x\n\nIntersection points of the constraints:\nA. (0, 0) - intersection of x-axis and y-axis\nB. (0, 120) - intersection of y-axis and labor constraint\nC. (0, 150) - intersection of y-axis and machine time constraint\nD. (80, 0) - intersection of x-axis and labor constraint\nE. (75, 0) - intersection of x-axis and machine time constraint\nF. (60, 60) - intersection of labor constraint and machine time constraint\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function P = 5x + 7y at each of these points:\n\nA. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\nB. P(0, 120) = 5(0) + 7(120) = $840\nC. P(0, 150) = 5(0) + 7(150) = $1050\nD. P(80, 0) = 5(80) + 7(0) = $400\nE. P(75, 0) = 5(75) + 7(0) = $375\nF. P(60, 60) = 5(60) + 7(60) = $720\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, where the company produces 0 units of product X and 150 units of product Y. The maximum profit is $1050."
