    "message_2": "To apply the Mean Value Theorem, we need to first ensure that the function is continuous on the closed interval [0, 2] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 2). Since the car is traveling, we can assume that the position function of the car is continuous and differentiable on the given intervals.\n\nLet f(t) represent the position function of the car with respect to time t, where t is in hours. We know that f(0) is the starting position and f(2) is the position after 2 hours. Since the car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, we have:\n\nf(2) - f(0) = 120 miles\n\nNow, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem, which states that there exists a value c in the open interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the position function (i.e., the velocity function) at c is equal to the average rate of change of the position function over the closed interval [0, 2]. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nf'(c) = (f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nWe already know that f(2) - f(0) = 120 miles, and the denominator (2 - 0) represents the time interval of 2 hours. Therefore, we have:\n\nf'(c) = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a value c in the open interval (0, 2) such that the car's velocity at time c is exactly 60 miles per hour. This proves that at some point during the trip, the car was traveling exactly 60 miles per hour."
