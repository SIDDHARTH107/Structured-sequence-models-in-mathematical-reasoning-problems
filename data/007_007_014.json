    "message_2": "To solve for integers x and y in the equation 3x + 7y = 19, we can use the Diophantine equation method.\n\nFirst, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients of x and y, which are 3 and 7. Since 3 and 7 are both prime numbers, their GCD is 1. Since the GCD(3, 7) divides 19, there exists a solution for this equation.\n\nNow, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients for BÃ©zout's identity, which states that ax + by = gcd(a, b). In this case, we want to find integers x' and y' such that:\n\n3x' + 7y' = 1\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n7 = 3 * 2 + 1\n1 = 7 - 3 * 2\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1 = 7(1) - 3(2)\n\nThus, x' = -2 and y' = 1. Now, we can multiply both sides of this equation by 19:\n\n19 = 3(-2 * 19) + 7(1 * 19)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n19 = 3(-38) + 7(19)\n\nSo, one solution is x = -38 and y = 19. However, there are infinitely many solutions to this Diophantine equation. To find the general solution, we can use the following formula:\n\nx = x' + k * (7 / gcd(3, 7))\ny = y' - k * (3 / gcd(3, 7))\n\nSince gcd(3, 7) = 1, the formula becomes:\n\nx = -38 + 7k\ny = 19 - 3k\n\nFor any integer k, this will give a valid solution for the equation 3x + 7y = 19."
