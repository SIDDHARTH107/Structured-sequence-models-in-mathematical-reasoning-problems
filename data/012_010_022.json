    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To find the minimum number of vertices in a vertex cover, we can use the concept of a maximum matching.\n\nA matching is a set of edges in a graph such that no two edges share a common vertex. A maximum matching is a matching with the maximum possible number of edges. According to König's theorem, in a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching.\n\nHowever, we don't know if the given graph is bipartite or not. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is not bipartite, and we can't apply König's theorem directly. In this case, we can use an upper bound for the size of the maximum matching.\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a matching is half the total number of edges, rounded down. This is because each edge in the matching covers two vertices, and we can't have more than half the edges in a matching without having some vertices with more than one incident edge.\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges in a matching for this graph is floor(10/2) = 5.\n\nSince each vertex in the vertex cover can cover at most one edge in the matching, the minimum number of vertices in a vertex cover is at least equal to the size of the maximum matching. Therefore, the minimum number of vertices in a vertex cover of the graph is 5."
