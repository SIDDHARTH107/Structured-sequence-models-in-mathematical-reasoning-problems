    "message_1": "A mathematical model of the population dynamics of a certain species shows that it exhibits period doubling as the parameter 位 is increased. The population size when 位 = 2.9 is 1000. What is the population size when 位 = 3.5?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the specific mathematical model being used to describe the population dynamics. Period doubling is a phenomenon observed in various mathematical models, such as the logistic map, but without knowing the specific model and its equations, we cannot determine the population size when 位 = 3.5.\n\nIf you can provide the specific model and its equations, we would be happy to help you solve the problem."
