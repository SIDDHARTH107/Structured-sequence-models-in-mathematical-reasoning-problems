    "message_2": "To calculate the z-score, we use the formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the individual data point (the student's score), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 85, μ = 75, and σ = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (85 - 75) / 10\nz = 10 / 10\nz = 1\n\nThe student's z-score is 1."
