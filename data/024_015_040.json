    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of the two-form $\\omega$, we need to apply the exterior derivative to each term separately and then sum the results. Recall that the exterior derivative is a linear operator, so we can apply it to each term individually.\n\nFirst, let's consider the term $x^2\\, dx \\wedge dy$. Applying the exterior derivative, we get:\n\n$$d(x^2\\, dx \\wedge dy) = d(x^2) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nNow, we need to compute $d(x^2)$. Using the chain rule, we have:\n\n$$d(x^2) = 2x\\, dx$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the first term is:\n\n$$d(x^2\\, dx \\wedge dy) = (2x\\, dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nSince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, this term vanishes:\n\n$$d(x^2\\, dx \\wedge dy) = 0$$\n\nNow, let's consider the term $y^3\\, dx \\wedge dz$. Applying the exterior derivative, we get:\n\n$$d(y^3\\, dx \\wedge dz) = d(y^3) \\wedge dx \\wedge dz$$\n\nNow, we need to compute $d(y^3)$. Using the chain rule, we have:\n\n$$d(y^3) = 3y^2\\, dy$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the second term is:\n\n$$d(y^3\\, dx \\wedge dz) = (3y^2\\, dy) \\wedge dx \\wedge dz$$\n\nNow, we can sum the exterior derivatives of both terms:\n\n$$d\\omega = d(x^2\\, dx \\wedge dy) + d(y^3\\, dx \\wedge dz) = 0 + (3y^2\\, dy) \\wedge dx \\wedge dz$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n\n$$d\\omega = 3y^2\\, dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dz$$"
