    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the given equation, we first need to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x. Since y is a function of x, we'll use the chain rule when differentiating y^2.\n\nd/dx (x^2 + y^2) = d/dx (25)\n\nDifferentiating both sides:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\n\nDivide both sides by 2y:\n\ndy/dx = -2x / 2y\n\nSimplify:\n\ndy/dx = -x / y"
