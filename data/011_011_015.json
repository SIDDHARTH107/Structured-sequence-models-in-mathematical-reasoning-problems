    "message_2": "To partition the number 10 into distinct positive integers, we need to find the number of ways to express 10 as a sum of distinct positive integers. This is also known as finding the number of restricted partitions of 10.\n\nWe can use the method of Ferrers diagrams to solve this problem. A Ferrers diagram is a graphical representation of a partition, where each part is represented by a row of dots, and the rows are arranged in non-increasing order of length.\n\nHere are the distinct partitions of 10:\n\n1. 10\n2. 9 + 1\n3. 8 + 2\n4. 7 + 3\n5. 6 + 4\n6. 6 + 3 + 1\n7. 5 + 4 + 1\n8. 5 + 3 + 2\n\nThere are 8 ways to partition the number 10 into distinct positive integers."
