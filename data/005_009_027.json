    "message_2": "To find the median of a set of data, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20\n\nSince there are 10 numbers in the data set, an even number, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers (the 5th and 6th numbers in this case).\n\nThe 5th number is 10 and the 6th number is 11. The average of these two numbers is:\n\n(10 + 11) / 2 = 21 / 2 = 10.5\n\nSo, the median of this data set is 10.5."
