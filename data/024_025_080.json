    "message_2": "To compute the Chern classes of X, we first need to find a suitable tangent bundle for X. Since X is a complex manifold, we can consider the holomorphic tangent bundle TX. The equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 = 1 defines a hypersurface in C^4, so we can use the adjunction formula to compute the Chern classes of X.\n\nThe adjunction formula states that for a hypersurface X in a complex manifold Y, we have:\n\nc(TX) = c(TY) / c(NX),\n\nwhere c(TX) and c(TY) are the total Chern classes of X and Y, respectively, and c(NX) is the total Chern class of the normal bundle of X in Y.\n\nIn our case, Y = C^4, so the tangent bundle TY is trivial and has total Chern class c(TY) = (1 + 0)^4 = 1, since the Chern classes of a trivial bundle are all zero except for the zeroth Chern class, which is always 1.\n\nNext, we need to compute the total Chern class of the normal bundle NX. Since X is defined by a single equation, NX is a line bundle, and its first Chern class is determined by the curvature of the line bundle. The equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 = 1 is the real part of the equation (x + iy)(x - iy) + (z + it)(z - it) = 1, which is a sum of squares of holomorphic functions. Thus, the normal bundle NX is isomorphic to the canonical bundle of X, and its first Chern class is the same as the first Chern class of X.\n\nNow we can apply the adjunction formula:\n\nc(TX) = c(TY) / c(NX) = 1 / (1 + c_1(NX)).\n\nSince c(TY) = 1, we have c(TX) = 1 + c_1(NX), and thus the first Chern class of X is:\n\nc_1(X) = c_1(NX).\n\nTo compute the second Chern class of X, we can use the formula:\n\nc_2(X) = (1/2) * (c_1(X)^2 - c_1(TY) * c_1(X)).\n\nSince c_1(TY) = 0, we have:\n\nc_2(X) = (1/2) * c_1(X)^2.\n\nIn summary, the first Chern class of X is given by the first Chern class of the normal bundle NX, and the second Chern class of X is given by half the square of the first Chern class:\n\nc_1(X) = c_1(NX),\nc_2(X) = (1/2) * c_1(X)^2."
