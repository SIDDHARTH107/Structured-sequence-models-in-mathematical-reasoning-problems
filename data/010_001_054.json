    "message_2": "The topology T consists of the set X and all subsets of X containing 1. So, the open sets of (X, T) are:\n\n1. The empty set ∅ (since every topology must contain the empty set)\n2. The whole set X = {1, 2, 3} (since every topology must contain the whole set)\n3. The subsets of X containing 1:\n   a. {1} (contains only 1)\n   b. {1, 2} (contains 1 and 2)\n   c. {1, 3} (contains 1 and 3)\n\nSo, the open sets of (X, T) are: ∅, {1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, and {1, 2, 3}."
