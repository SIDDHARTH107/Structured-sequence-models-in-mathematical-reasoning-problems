    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, speed of the wave, and the phase constant, we need to compare the given wave function to the general form of a wave function:\n\n$$y(x,t) = A \\cos(kx - \\omega t + \\phi)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wave number, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase constant.\n\nGiven wave function: $y(x,t) = 2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}(4x-5t)\\right)$\n\nFirst, we can identify the amplitude $A$ as the coefficient of the cosine function. In this case, the amplitude is:\n\n$$A = 2$$\n\nNext, we can find the wave number $k$ and the angular frequency $\\omega$ by comparing the coefficients of $x$ and $t$ inside the cosine function. We have:\n\n$$k = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\cdot 4 = \\pi$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\omega = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\cdot 5 = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$$\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength $\\lambda$ and frequency $f$ using the following relationships:\n\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$$\n\nand\n\n$$f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$$\n\nPlugging in the values of $k$ and $\\omega$, we get:\n\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi} = 2$$\n\nand\n\n$$f = \\frac{\\frac{5\\pi}{4}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{5}{8}$$\n\nThe speed of the wave $v$ can be found using the relationship:\n\n$$v = \\lambda f$$\n\nPlugging in the values of $\\lambda$ and $f$, we get:\n\n$$v = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\nFinally, since there is no additional phase shift in the given wave function, the phase constant $\\phi$ is:\n\n$$\\phi = 0$$\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is $A = 2$, the wavelength is $\\lambda = 2$, the frequency is $f = \\frac{5}{8}$, the speed of the wave is $v = \\frac{5}{4}$, and the phase constant is $\\phi = 0$."
