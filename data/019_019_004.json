    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that cannot be obtained as the sum of distinct powers of 7, we can use the concept of base-7 numbers.\n\nIn base-7, each digit can have a value from 0 to 6. We can represent any positive integer as a sum of distinct powers of 7 by converting it to base-7 and then using the base-7 digits as coefficients of the powers of 7.\n\nFor example, the number 100 can be represented as 202 in base-7, which means 100 = 2*(7^2) + 0*(7^1) + 2*(7^0) = 2*(49) + 0*(7) + 2*(1) = 98 + 0 + 2 = 100.\n\nHowever, if we have a base-7 number with all digits equal to 6, we cannot represent the next integer using distinct powers of 7. This is because adding 1 to a base-7 number with all digits equal to 6 will result in a base-7 number with all digits equal to 0 and an additional digit equal to 1.\n\nFor example, consider the base-7 number 666. Adding 1 to this number results in the base-7 number 1000, which means the next integer cannot be represented using distinct powers of 7.\n\nNow, let's convert the base-7 number 666 to a decimal number:\n\n666 (base-7) = 6*(7^2) + 6*(7^1) + 6*(7^0) = 6*(49) + 6*(7) + 6*(1) = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that cannot be obtained as the sum of distinct powers of 7 is 342 + 1 = 343."
