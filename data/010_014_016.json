    "message_2": "To find the cohomology groups of X with coefficients in ℤ2, we first need to compute the simplicial cochain complexes and their corresponding boundary maps. The simplicial complex X has the following structure:\n\n0-simplices: {v1, v2, v3}\n1-simplices: {e1, e2, e3}\n2-simplices: {t}\n\nNow, we define the cochain groups C^n(X, ℤ2) for n = 0, 1, 2:\n\nC^0(X, ℤ2) = Hom(C_0(X), ℤ2) = ℤ2 ⊕ ℤ2 ⊕ ℤ2 (one copy of ℤ2 for each vertex)\nC^1(X, ℤ2) = Hom(C_1(X), ℤ2) = ℤ2 ⊕ ℤ2 ⊕ ℤ2 (one copy of ℤ2 for each edge)\nC^2(X, ℤ2) = Hom(C_2(X), ℤ2) = ℤ2 (one copy of ℤ2 for the triangle)\n\nNext, we define the coboundary maps δ^n: C^n(X, ℤ2) → C^(n+1)(X, ℤ2) for n = 0, 1:\n\nδ^0: C^0(X, ℤ2) → C^1(X, ℤ2)\nδ^1: C^1(X, ℤ2) → C^2(X, ℤ2)\n\nThe coboundary maps are defined as follows:\n\nδ^0(f) = f ∂^0, where f ∈ C^0(X, ℤ2) and ∂^0 is the boundary map from C_0(X) to C_1(X)\nδ^1(g) = g ∂^1, where g ∈ C^1(X, ℤ2) and ∂^1 is the boundary map from C_1(X) to C_2(X)\n\nNow, we compute the cohomology groups H^n(X, ℤ2) = ker(δ^n) / im(δ^(n-1)) for n = 0, 1, 2:\n\nH^0(X, ℤ2) = ker(δ^0) / im(δ^(-1))\nSince δ^(-1) is not defined, im(δ^(-1)) = 0. The kernel of δ^0 consists of all constant functions, so H^0(X, ℤ2) = ℤ2.\n\nH^1(X, ℤ2) = ker(δ^1) / im(δ^0)\nThe kernel of δ^1 consists of all functions that map the edges to 0, and the image of δ^0 consists of all functions that map the vertices to 0. Since the triangle t has all three vertices, the kernel and image of δ^1 and δ^0 are the same, so H^1(X, ℤ2) = 0.\n\nH^2(X, ℤ2) = ker(δ^2) / im(δ^1)\nSince there are no 3-simplices in X, C^3(X, ℤ2) = 0 and δ^2 = 0. Therefore, ker(δ^2) = C^2(X, ℤ2) = ℤ2. The image of δ^1 is trivial, so H^2(X, ℤ2) = ℤ2.\n\nIn summary, the cohomology groups of X with coefficients in ℤ2 are:\n\nH^0(X, ℤ2) = ℤ2\nH^1(X, ℤ2) = 0\nH^2(X, ℤ2) = ℤ2"
