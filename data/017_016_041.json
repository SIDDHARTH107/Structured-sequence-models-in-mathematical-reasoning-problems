    "message_2": "A group of order 27 has a prime order, since 27 = 3^3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in a group of order 27 must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, which means that the group is a 3-group.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups, a group of order 27 can be isomorphic to one of the following forms:\n\n1. Z_27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. Z_9 × Z_3 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 3)\n3. Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nAll three of these groups are abelian. Therefore, there are 3 abelian groups of order 27.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any non-abelian groups of order 27. Since the group is a 3-group, we can apply the classification of groups of order p^3, where p is a prime number. In this case, p = 3. There are exactly 5 groups of order p^3 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. Z_(p^3)\n2. Z_(p^2) × Z_p\n3. Z_p × Z_p × Z_p\n4. The semidirect product of Z_(p^2) and Z_p, where the action is non-trivial\n5. The Heisenberg group of order p^3\n\nWe have already counted the first three groups, which are abelian. The fourth group is non-abelian, and the fifth group (the Heisenberg group) is non-abelian as well. Therefore, there are 2 non-abelian groups of order 27.\n\nIn total, there are 3 abelian groups and 2 non-abelian groups of order 27, making a total of 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 27."
