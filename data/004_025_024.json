    "message_1": "A particle moving along a straight line is acted upon by a force F = 3x - 5, where x is the distance of the particle from a fixed point O. If the particle starts moving from rest at x = 2, what is its velocity when it reaches x = 5?",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the particle when it reaches x = 5, we first need to determine the work done by the force F on the particle as it moves from x = 2 to x = 5. The work done by a force is given by the integral of the force with respect to the distance.\n\nW = ∫(3x - 5) dx from x = 2 to x = 5\n\nNow, we integrate the force function:\n\nW = [ (3/2)x^2 - 5x ] from x = 2 to x = 5\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = ( (3/2)(5)^2 - 5(5) ) - ( (3/2)(2)^2 - 5(2) )\nW = ( (3/2)(25) - 25 ) - ( (3/2)(4) - 10 )\nW = ( 37.5 - 25 ) - ( 6 - 10 )\nW = 12.5 + 4\nW = 16.5 J (Joules)\n\nNow, we know that work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the particle:\n\nW = ΔK.E = (1/2)mv^2 - (1/2)mu^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, v is the final velocity, and u is the initial velocity. Since the particle starts from rest, u = 0.\n\n16.5 = (1/2)mv^2\n\nTo find the velocity (v), we need to know the mass (m) of the particle. However, since the mass is not given, we cannot determine the exact value of the velocity. If the mass is provided, we can solve for the velocity using the equation above."
