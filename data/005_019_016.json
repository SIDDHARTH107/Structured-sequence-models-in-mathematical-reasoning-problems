    "message_1": "Suppose a basketball player has a 60% chance of making a free throw each time they take one. If the player continues to take free throws until they miss two in a row, what is the probability that they make exactly 4 free throws before missing two in a row?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the geometric distribution to solve this problem. We are looking for the probability of making exactly 4 free throws before missing two in a row.\n\nThe probability of making a free throw is 0.6, and the probability of missing a free throw is 0.4.\n\nThe sequence of events we are looking for is: make, make, make, make, miss, miss. The probability of this sequence occurring is:\n\nP(make) * P(make) * P(make) * P(make) * P(miss) * P(miss) = 0.6^4 * 0.4^2\n\nCalculating this probability:\n\n(0.6^4) * (0.4^2) = 0.01296\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player makes exactly 4 free throws before missing two in a row is 0.01296 or 1.296%."
