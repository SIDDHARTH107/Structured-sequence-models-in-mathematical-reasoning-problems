    "message_2": "To encode the message \"MATH IS COOL\" using the Playfair Cipher with the key \"SECRETKEY\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key \"SECRETKEY\":\n   Remove duplicate letters from the key and then fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is usually combined with 'I').\n\n   Key without duplicates: SECRTPKY\n   Remaining alphabet: ABDFGHILMNOQUVWXZ\n\n   Fill the 5x5 matrix:\n   S E C R T\n   P K Y A B\n   D F G H I\n   L M N O Q\n   U V W X Z\n\n2. Prepare the plaintext message:\n   Remove spaces and split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\n   Message: MATHISCOOL\n   Digraphs: MA TH IS CO OL\n\n3. Encode each digraph using the Playfair matrix:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their immediate right (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below them (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle.\n\n   MA -> PK\n   TH -> YD\n   IS -> FG\n   CO -> QW\n   OL -> QZ\n\n4. Combine the encoded digraphs to get the encrypted message:\n   Encrypted message: PKYDFGQWQZ"
