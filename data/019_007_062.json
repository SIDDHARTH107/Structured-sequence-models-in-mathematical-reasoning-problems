    "message_2": "First, we need to find the total value of the products after the customer returns $30 worth of products. \n\nInitial purchase: $150\nValue of returned products: $30\n\nTotal value after return: $150 - $30 = $120\n\nSince the total value is more than $100, the customer is eligible for the 10% discount. \n\nDiscount: 10% of $120 = 0.10 * $120 = $12\n\nFinal price after discount: $120 - $12 = $108\n\nThe customer pays $108 for their purchase after the discount is applied."
