    "message_1": "A ferris wheel has a diameter of 50 feet and makes one revolution every 40 seconds. As a rider gets on the ferris wheel, his/her distance from the ground varies depending on the angle of the wheel. Assuming the rider gets on at the lowest point, write a problem to determine the amplitude and period of the rider's distance from the ground, modeled by a trigonometric function.",
    "message_2": "Problem: A ferris wheel with a diameter of 50 feet makes one revolution every 40 seconds. A rider gets on the ferris wheel at the lowest point. Let the rider's distance from the ground be represented by the function h(t), where t is the time in seconds. Determine the amplitude and period of the function h(t) that models the rider's distance from the ground as a trigonometric function."
