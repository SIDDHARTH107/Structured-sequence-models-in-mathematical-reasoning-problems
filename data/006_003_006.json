    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to draw 3 cards from a deck of 52 cards. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 52 (total number of cards) and k = 3 (number of cards drawn). So, the total number of ways to draw 3 cards from a deck of 52 cards is:\n\nC(52, 3) = 52! / (3!(52-3)!) = 52! / (3!49!) = (52 × 51 × 50) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 22100\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to draw at least one king from the deck. There are 4 kings in the deck. We can use the complementary probability, which means we'll find the probability of not drawing any king and subtract it from 1.\n\nThere are 48 cards that are not kings (52 - 4). The number of ways to draw 3 cards without any king is:\n\nC(48, 3) = 48! / (3!(48-3)!) = 48! / (3!45!) = (48 × 47 × 46) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 17296\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of not drawing any king:\n\nP(not drawing any king) = (number of ways to draw 3 cards without any king) / (total number of ways to draw 3 cards) = 17296 / 22100 = 0.7828 (approximately)\n\nFinally, we'll find the probability of drawing at least one king:\n\nP(drawing at least one king) = 1 - P(not drawing any king) = 1 - 0.7828 = 0.2172 (approximately)\n\nSo, the probability of drawing at least one king from a standard deck of 52 cards when drawing 3 cards without replacement is approximately 0.2172 or 21.72%."
