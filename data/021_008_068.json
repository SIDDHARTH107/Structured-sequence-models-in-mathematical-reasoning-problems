    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let F(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)), where f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 25 and f2(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 7. The Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x  2y |\n          | 2x -2y |\n\nNow, we apply Newton's method using the initial guess (x0, y0) = (1, 2). The iterative formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x, y) = (x0, y0) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0)\n\nFirst, we compute F(x0, y0):\n\nF(1, 2) = (1^2 + 2^2 - 25, 1^2 - 2^2 - 7) = (-20, -11)\n\nNext, we compute J(x0, y0):\n\nJ(1, 2) = | 2  4 |\n          | 2 -4 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of J(x0, y0). The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\nJ^(-1) = (1/det(J)) * |  d  -b |\n                        | -c   a |\n\nwhere det(J) = ad - bc. In our case, a = 2, b = 4, c = 2, and d = -4. So, det(J) = (2 * -4) - (4 * 2) = -16. The inverse of J(x0, y0) is:\n\nJ^(-1) = (-1/16) * | -4 -4 |\n                   | -2  2 |\n\nNow, we can compute the product J^(-1) * F(x0, y0):\n\nJ^(-1) * F(x0, y0) = (-1/16) * | -4 -4 | * | -20 |\n                                 | -2  2 |   | -11 |\n\n                           = (-1/16) * |  56  |\n                                       | -18  |\n\nFinally, we update our guess (x0, y0) using the iterative formula:\n\n(x, y) = (1, 2) - (-1/16) * (56, -18) = (1 + 3.5, 2 + 1.125) = (4.5, 3.125)\n\nSo, after one iteration of Newton's method, our updated guess for the solution of the system of equations is (x, y) ≈ (4.5, 3.125). Further iterations can be performed to refine the solution if desired."
