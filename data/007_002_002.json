    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 3, 5, and 7, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nPrime factorization of the numbers:\n3 = 3^1\n5 = 5^1\n7 = 7^1\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor and multiply them together:\nLCM = 3^1 × 5^1 × 7^1 = 3 × 5 × 7 = 15 × 7 = 105\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 3, 5, and 7 is 105."
