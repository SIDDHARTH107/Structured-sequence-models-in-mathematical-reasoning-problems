    "message_2": "Using the unit circle, we know that the coordinates of a point on the circle are given by (cos(θ), sin(θ)), where θ is the angle measured in radians.\n\nWhen θ = π/6 (which is equivalent to 30 degrees), we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 right triangle to find the exact value of cos(π/6).\n\nIn a 30-60-90 right triangle, the side lengths are in the ratio 1:√3:2. The hypotenuse is the longest side (2), and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle (π/6 radians) is the shortest side (1).\n\nSo, cos(π/6) is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse:\n\ncos(π/6) = 1/2"
