For this, we need to show that (A × B) ∩ A ≠ A × (B ∩ A) and (B × A) ∩ A ≠ B × (A ∩ B).\n\nFirst, let's find the intersections B ∩ A and A ∩ B:\n\nB ∩ A = {2}\nA ∩ B = {2}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products A × (B ∩ A) and B × (A ∩ B):\n\nA × (B ∩ A) = A × {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2)}\nB × (A ∩ B) = B × {2} = {(2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\nAs we can see:\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅ ≠ A × (B ∩ A) = {(1, 2), (2, 2)}\n(B × A) ∩ A = ∅ ≠ B × (A ∩ B) = {(2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\nThus, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
