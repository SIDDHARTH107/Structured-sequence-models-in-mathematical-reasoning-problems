    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the foot of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that when x = 12 feet, dy/dt = -5 feet per second (since the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall). We want to find dy/dt when x = 9 feet.\n\nSince the ladder is sliding down the wall, the length of the ladder remains constant. Let L be the length of the ladder. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = L^2\n\nNow, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that when x = 12 feet, dy/dt = -5 feet per second. We need to find the value of y at this moment. We can do this by plugging x = 12 into the Pythagorean equation:\n\n12^2 + y^2 = L^2\n144 + y^2 = L^2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of dx/dt when x = 12 feet. We can do this by plugging x = 12, y, and dy/dt = -5 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(12)(dx/dt) + 2y(-5) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 9 feet. We can do this by plugging x = 9 into the Pythagorean equation:\n\n9^2 + y^2 = L^2\n81 + y^2 = L^2\n\nSince L^2 is constant, we can set the two equations for L^2 equal to each other:\n\n144 + y1^2 = 81 + y2^2\n\nWhere y1 is the value of y when x = 12 feet, and y2 is the value of y when x = 9 feet. Solving for y1 and y2, we get:\n\ny1^2 = 63\ny1 = sqrt(63)\n\ny2^2 = 126\ny2 = sqrt(126)\n\nNow, we can plug x = 9, y = sqrt(126), and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(9)(dx/dt) + 2(sqrt(126))(-5) = 0\n\nSolving for dx/dt, we get:\n\n18(dx/dt) = 10(sqrt(126))\ndx/dt = 5(sqrt(126))/9\n\nNow, we can find dy/dt when x = 9 feet by plugging x = 9, y = sqrt(126), and dx/dt = 5(sqrt(126))/9 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(9)(5(sqrt(126))/9) + 2(sqrt(126))(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSimplifying and solving for dy/dt, we get:\n\n10(sqrt(126)) + 2(sqrt(126))(dy/dt) = 0\ndy/dt = -10(sqrt(126))/(2(sqrt(126)))\ndy/dt = -5\n\nSo, the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 5 feet per second when the foot of the ladder is 9 feet from the wall."
