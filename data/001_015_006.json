    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n4^(x+1) = 32\n\nSince 32 is a power of 4, we can rewrite 32 as 4^3:\n\n4^(x+1) = 4^3\n\nNow, since the bases are equal, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 1 = 3\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 3 - 1\nx = 2"
