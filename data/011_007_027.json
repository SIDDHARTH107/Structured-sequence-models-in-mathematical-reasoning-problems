    "message_1": "A student has 10 identical balls that they want to distribute among 5 different boxes. Each box must have at least 1 ball. How many ways can they distribute the balls among the boxes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the stars and bars method. Since each box must have at least 1 ball, we can start by placing 1 ball in each box. Now, we have 5 balls left to distribute among the 5 boxes.\n\nWe can represent the balls as stars (*) and the dividers between the boxes as bars (|). For example, if we have 3 balls left to distribute, a possible arrangement could be:\n\n* | * * | * | | *\n\nThis represents 1 ball in the first box, 2 balls in the second box, 1 ball in the third box, and no additional balls in the fourth and fifth boxes.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the 5 remaining balls and 4 dividers (since we have 5 boxes). This is a combination problem, as we need to choose the positions for the dividers among the total number of positions (5 balls + 4 dividers = 9 positions).\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the dividers is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 9 (total positions) and k = 4 (number of dividers):\n\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!(9-4)!)\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!5!)\nC(9, 4) = 362880 / (24 * 120)\nC(9, 4) = 362880 / 2880\nC(9, 4) = 126\n\nSo there are 126 ways to distribute the remaining 5 balls among the 5 boxes, given that each box already has 1 ball."
