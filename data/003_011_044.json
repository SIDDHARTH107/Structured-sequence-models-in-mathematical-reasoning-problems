    "message_1": "A bird lands on top of a tree at point A, which is 20 meters high. The bird spots a worm on the ground at point B. The distance from the bird to the worm is 25 meters. If the bird wants to fly down to the ground and eat the worm, how far does it have to fly? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the distance the bird has to fly as C. We have a right-angled triangle with sides A, B, and C, where A is the height of the tree (20 meters), B is the horizontal distance from the bird to the worm (25 meters), and C is the distance the bird has to fly.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nC^2 = A^2 + B^2\nC^2 = (20)^2 + (25)^2\nC^2 = 400 + 625\nC^2 = 1025\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 1025 to get the value of C:\n\nC = √1025 ≈ 32.0156\n\nRounding the answer to two decimal places, the bird has to fly approximately 32.02 meters to reach the worm."
