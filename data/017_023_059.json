(S_3 × Z_4) ⋊ Z_3\n5. (S_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_4\n6. S_3 × Z_4 ⋊ Z_3\n7. S_3 × Z_3 ⋊ Z_4\n8. S_3 × D_12\n9. S_3 × Q_12\n\nHere, S_3 represents the symmetric group of degree 3, Z_n represents the cyclic group of order n, D_n represents the dihedral group of order 2n, Q_n represents the quaternion group of order 4n, and ⋊ denotes a semidirect product."
