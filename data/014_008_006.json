    "message_1": "Here is a math problem related to block ciphers:\n\nSuppose you have a block cipher that uses 64-bit blocks and a key length of 128 bits. How many possible keys can be generated by this cipher?",
    "message_2": "A block cipher with a key length of 128 bits means that there are 2^128 possible keys. To calculate this, you simply raise 2 to the power of the key length:\n\n2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456\n\nSo, there are 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible keys that can be generated by this cipher."
