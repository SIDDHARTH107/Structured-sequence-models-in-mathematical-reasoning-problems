    "message_1": "In a group of 50 students, 25 students study Spanish, 20 students study French and 15 students study German. Also, 10 students study both Spanish and French, 8 students study both Spanish and German, and 5 students study both French and German. How many students in the group are studying at least one of these three languages?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students studying at least one of these three languages, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of students studying at least one language = (Number of students studying Spanish) + (Number of students studying French) + (Number of students studying German) - (Number of students studying both Spanish and French) - (Number of students studying both Spanish and German) - (Number of students studying both French and German) + (Number of students studying all three languages)\n\nLet's first find the number of students studying all three languages. We know that:\n\n10 students study both Spanish and French\n8 students study both Spanish and German\n5 students study both French and German\n\nLet x be the number of students studying all three languages. Then:\n\n10 - x students study both Spanish and French but not German\n8 - x students study both Spanish and German but not French\n5 - x students study both French and German but not Spanish\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find the number of students studying at least one language:\n\n25 students study Spanish = (10 - x) + (8 - x) + x\n20 students study French = (10 - x) + (5 - x) + x\n15 students study German = (8 - x) + (5 - x) + x\n\nSolving the first equation for x, we get:\n\n25 = 18 - x\nx = 18 - 25\nx = -7\n\nSince x cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement. Please check the given information and try again."
