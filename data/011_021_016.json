    "message_1": "A traveling salesman needs to visit 5 different cities in a single day. The distances (in km) between the cities are as follows:\n\nCity A to City B - 20km\nCity A to City C - 50km\nCity A to City D - 30km\nCity A to City E - 40km\nCity B to City C - 25km\nCity B to City D - 45km\nCity B to City E - 35km\nCity C to City D - 30km\nCity C to City E - 20km\nCity D to City E - 15km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible route the salesman can take to visit all 5 cities and return back to his starting point? What is the total distance he will have to travel?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible routes and calculating their total distances. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible routes. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5, which gives us 24 unique routes to consider. Here are the routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A: 20 + 25 + 30 + 15 + 40 = 130 km\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A: 20 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 30 = 110 km\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A: 20 + 45 + 30 + 20 + 40 = 155 km\n4.

A-D-C-E-B-A: 30 + 30 + 20 + 35 + 20 = 135 km\n17. A-D-E-B-C-A: 30 + 15 + 35 + 25 + 50 = 155 km\n18. A-D-E-C-B-A: 30 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 20 = 110 km\n19. A-E-B-C-D-A: 40 + 35 + 25 + 30 + 30 = 160 km\n20.
