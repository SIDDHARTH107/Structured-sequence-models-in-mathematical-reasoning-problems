    "message_2": "Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. As of now, only 51 Mersenne primes are known, and they are not found in a simple arithmetic sequence. The 50th Mersenne prime was discovered on November 17, 2016, and it corresponds to n = 74,207,281. Therefore, the 50th Mersenne prime is:\n\n2^74,207,281 - 1\n\nThis number has 22,338,618 digits, making it too large to display here. However, it can be represented in the form mentioned above."
