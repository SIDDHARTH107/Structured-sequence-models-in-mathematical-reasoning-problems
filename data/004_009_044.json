    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x + 5)(3x - 2) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x + 5\nv(x) = 3x - 2\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(2x + 5)/dx = 2\nv'(x) = d(3x - 2)/dx = 3\n\nNow we can apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (2)(3x - 2) + (2x + 5)(3)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 4 + 6x + 15\nf'(x) = 12x + 11\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x + 5)(3x - 2) is f'(x) = 12x + 11."
