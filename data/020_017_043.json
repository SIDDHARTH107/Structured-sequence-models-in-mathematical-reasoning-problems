    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and h be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by V = x^2 * h. We are given that the maximum volume is 1000 cubic cm, so x^2 * h = 1000.\n\nThe cost of the bottom is $1 per sq cm, so the cost of the bottom is x^2. The cost of the sides is $0.50 per sq cm, so the cost of the sides is 0.50 * (4xh). Therefore, the total cost of the box is C = x^2 + 2xh.\n\nWe want to minimize the cost C, subject to the constraint x^2 * h = 1000. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function L(x, h, λ) = x^2 + 2xh - λ(x^2 * h - 1000).\n\nNow we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, h, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 2x + 2h - 2λxh = 0\n∂L/∂h = 2x - λx^2 = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x^2 * h - 1000 = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we have 2x = λx^2, so λ = 2/x. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n2x + 2h - 4h = 0\n2x = 2h\nx = h\n\nNow, substituting x = h into the constraint equation x^2 * h = 1000, we get:\n\nx^3 = 1000\nx = h = 10\n\nSo the dimensions of the box are x = 10 cm and h = 10 cm. The minimum cost of the box is:\n\nC = x^2 + 2xh = 10^2 + 2(10)(10) = 100 + 200 = $300."
