The cost of laying each kilometer of cable is $5000. The company wants to connect all 5 cities while minimizing the total cost.\n\n| Cities | A | B | C | D | E |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A      | 0 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 7 |\n| B      | 4 | 0 | 6 | 9 | 1 |\n| C      | 2 | 6 | 0 | 3 | 5 |\n| D      | 5 | 9 | 3 | 0 | 8 |\n| E      | 7 | 1 | 5 | 8 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost of laying cables to connect all 5 cities?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum total cost of laying cables to connect all 5 cities, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. Here, we will use Kruskal's algorithm.\n\n1. Sort all the edges (distances) in ascending order.\n   1 (B, E), 2 (A, C), 3 (C, D), 4 (A, B), 5 (C, E), 5 (A, D), 6 (B, C), 7 (A, E), 8 (D, E), 9 (B, D)\n\n2. Start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree (MST) while making sure there are no cycles.\n   - Add (B, E) to MST, cost = 1\n   - Add (A, C) to MST, cost = 2\n   - Add (C, D) to MST, cost = 3\n   - Add (A, B) to MST, cost = 4 (Adding (C, E) would create a cycle)\n   - Adding (C, E) or (A, D) would create a cycle, so we skip them.\n   - Adding (B, C) or (A, E) would create a cycle, so we skip them.\n   - Adding (D, E) or (B, D) would create a cycle, so we skip them.\n\n3. The minimum spanning tree now includes the edges (B, E), (A, C), (C, D), and (A, B). The total cost is the sum of the edge weights: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\n\n4. Multiply the total cost by the cost per kilometer of cable: 10 * $5000 = $50,000.\n\nThe minimum total cost of laying cables to connect all 5 cities is $50,000."
