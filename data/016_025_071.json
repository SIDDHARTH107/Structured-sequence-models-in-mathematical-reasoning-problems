    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski sieve construction, we start with a square and divide it into 9 smaller squares, removing the center one. We then repeat this process for each of the remaining 8 squares. After the third iteration, we will have removed a total of 1 + 8 + 8^2 = 1 + 8 + 64 = 73 triangles.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the triangles removed in each iteration.\n\n1. First iteration: We remove the center square, which is 1/9 of the total area. The side length of this square is 27 cm / 3 = 9 cm. The area of the removed triangle is (9 * 9) / 2 = 40.5 cm².\n\n2. Second iteration: We remove 8 center squares from the remaining 8 squares. Each of these squares has a side length of 9 cm / 3 = 3 cm. The area of each removed triangle is (3 * 3) / 2 = 4.5 cm². The total area removed in this iteration is 8 * 4.5 = 36 cm².\n\n3. Third iteration: We remove 64 center squares from the remaining 64 squares. Each of these squares has a side length of 3 cm / 3 = 1 cm. The area of each removed triangle is (1 * 1) / 2 = 0.5 cm². The total area removed in this iteration is 64 * 0.5 = 32 cm².\n\nThe total area of the removed triangles after the third iteration is 40.5 + 36 + 32 = 108.5 cm²."
