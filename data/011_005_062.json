    "message_2": "To choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 7 individuals, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of individuals (7 in this case) and k is the number of people to choose (3 in this case).\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\n\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo there are 35 ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 7 individuals."
