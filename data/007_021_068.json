    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding non-trivial factors of a composite number. Let's apply the algorithm to find the smallest factor of 9999991.\n\n1. Choose a random polynomial function, usually f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is the number we want to factor.\n2. Initialize two variables x and y with random values, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n   a. Update x using the polynomial function: x = f(x) mod n\n   b. Update y twice using the polynomial function: y = f(f(y)) mod n\n   c. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n: d = GCD(|x - y|, n)\n   d. If d > 1, then d is a non-trivial factor of n.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm for 9999991:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 9999991\n2. x = y = 2\n\nIteration 1:\na. x = f(x) mod 9999991 = (2^2 + 1) mod 9999991 = 5\nb. y = f(f(y)) mod 9999991 = f(5) mod 9999991 = (5^2 + 1) mod 9999991 = 26\nc. d = GCD(|5 - 26|, 9999991) = GCD(21, 9999991) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\na. x = f(x) mod 9999991 = (5^2 + 1) mod 9999991 = 26\nb. y = f(f(y)) mod 9999991 = f(26) mod 9999991 = (26^2 + 1) mod 9999991 = 677\nc. d = GCD(|26 - 677|, 9999991) = GCD(651, 9999991) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\na. x = f(x) mod 9999991 = (26^2 + 1) mod 9999991 = 677\nb. y = f(f(y)) mod 9999991 = f(677) mod 9999991 = (677^2 + 1) mod 9999991 = 458330\nc. d = GCD(|677 - 458330|, 9999991) = GCD(457653, 9999991) = 97\n\nThe smallest factor of 9999991 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 97."
