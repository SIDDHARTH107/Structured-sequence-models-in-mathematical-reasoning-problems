    "message_1": "A game of Nim is played with two players and a pile of 20 stones. On each turn, a player may remove 1, 2, or 3 stones from the pile. The player who removes the last stone wins. If the first player goes first, what is their winning strategy?",
    "message_2": "The winning strategy for the first player in this game of Nim is to always leave a multiple of 4 stones after their turn. This ensures that no matter how many stones the second player takes (1, 2, or 3), the first player can always take enough stones to bring the total back to a multiple of 4.\n\nHere's the strategy in detail:\n\n1. On the first turn, the first player takes 1 stone, leaving 19 stones in the pile.\n2. From this point on, if the second player takes 1 stone, the first player takes 3 stones; if the second player takes 2 stones, the first player takes 2 stones; if the second player takes 3 stones, the first player takes 1 stone. This ensures that the total stones removed by both players in each round is always 4.\n3. By following this strategy, the first player ensures that they will always be the one to remove the last stone, as the pile will eventually be reduced to a multiple of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 20) after their turn.\n\nSo, the winning strategy for the first player is to take 1 stone initially and then always take enough stones to make the total stones removed in each round equal to 4."
