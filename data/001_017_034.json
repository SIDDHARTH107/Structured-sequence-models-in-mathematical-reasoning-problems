    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(3x - 2) + log(x + 1) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the property log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b), we get:\n\nlog((3x - 2)(x + 1)) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the property a^log(b) = b to remove the logarithm:\n\n10^2 = (3x - 2)(x + 1)\n\n100 = (3x - 2)(x + 1)\n\nNow, we can expand the expression on the right side:\n\n100 = 3x^2 + x - 2x - 2\n\n100 = 3x^2 - x - 2\n\nNow, we set the equation to 0:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - x - 102\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -1, and c = -102. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(3)(-102))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (1 ± √(1 + 1224)) / 6\n\nx = (1 ± √1225) / 6\n\nx = (1 ± 35) / 6\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (1 + 35) / 6\nx = 36 / 6\nx = 6\n\nx = (1 - 35) / 6\nx = -34 / 6\nx = -17 / 3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 6 and x = -17/3."
