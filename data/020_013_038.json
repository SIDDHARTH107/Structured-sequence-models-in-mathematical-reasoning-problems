    "message_2": "To formulate the dual problem, we first introduce the dual variables y1 and y2 corresponding to the constraints:\n\nx1 + 3x2 <= 4\n2x1 + x2 <= 6\n\nThe dual problem is then given by:\n\nMinimize 4y1 + 6y2\n\nSubject to:\n\ny1 + 2y2 >= 2\n3y1 + y2 >= 3\n\ny1 >= 0, y2 >= 0\n\nNow, we can solve the dual problem using the graphical method. First, we plot the constraints on a graph with y1 on the vertical axis and y2 on the horizontal axis.\n\nThe constraints can be rewritten as:\n\ny1 >= 2 - 2y2\ny2 >= 3 - 3y1\n\nWe plot these lines and shade the feasible region, which is the region that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nNow, we find the minimum value of the objective function 4y1 + 6y2 in the feasible region. We can use the corner point method to evaluate the objective function at each corner point of the feasible region:\n\n1. (y1, y2) = (0, 3): 4y1 + 6y2 = 18\n2. (y1, y2) = (2/3, 2/3): 4y1 + 6y2 = 12\n\nThe minimum value of the objective function is 12, which occurs at the point (2/3, 2/3). Therefore, the optimal solution of the dual problem is y1 = 2/3 and y2 = 2/3, with an optimal value of 12.\n\nNow, we can use the complementary slackness conditions to find the optimal solution of the primal problem:\n\nx1*(y1 + 2y2 - 2) = 0\nx2*(3y1 + y2 - 3) = 0\n\nSince y1 = 2/3 and y2 = 2/3, we have:\n\nx1*(4/3 - 2) = 0\nx2*(4/3 - 3) = 0\n\nThis implies that x1 = 0 and x2 = 2. Therefore, the optimal solution of the primal problem is x1 = 0 and x2 = 2, with an optimal value of 2*0 + 3*2 = 6."
