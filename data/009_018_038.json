    "message_2": "To find the value of $k$ for which the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the system and then analyze the stability of these points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are found by setting the right-hand sides of the given differential equations to zero:\n\n$-y = 0$\n$x + kx^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $y = 0$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$x(1 + kx) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two equilibrium points: $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ and $(x, y) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{k}, 0\\right)$, for $k \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, we need to analyze the stability of these equilibrium points by linearizing the system around these points. We do this by finding the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n\n$J(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial(-y)}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial(-y)}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial(x + kx^2)}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial(x + kx^2)}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 + 2kx & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFor the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\n$J(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation:\n\n$\\det(J - \\lambda I) = \\det\\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda & -1 \\\\ 1 & -\\lambda \\end{bmatrix} = \\lambda^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\pm i$, which are purely imaginary. This means that the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$ is a center, and its stability depends on the higher-order terms of the system.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $\\left(-\\frac{1}{k}, 0\\right)$, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\n$J\\left(-\\frac{1}{k}, 0\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 - 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{k}\\right) & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 + \\frac{2}{k} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation:\n\n$\\det(J - \\lambda I) = \\det\\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda & -1 \\\\ 1 + \\frac{2}{k} & -\\lambda \\end{bmatrix} = \\lambda^2 + 1 + \\frac{2}{k} = 0$\n\nFor a Hopf bifurcation to occur, the real part of the eigenvalues must change sign as a parameter (in this case, $k$) is varied. This means that the eigenvalues must be purely imaginary for some value of $k$. Let $\\lambda = \\pm i\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is a real number. Substituting this into the characteristic equation, we get:\n\n$(-i\\omega)^2 + 1 + \\frac{2}{k} = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$-\\omega^2 + 1 + \\frac{2}{k} = 0$\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $k$ for which $\\omega^2 = 1$. This occurs when:\n\n$1 + \\frac{2}{k} = 1$\n\nSolving for $k$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{2}{k} = 0 \\Rightarrow k \\rightarrow \\infty$\n\nSo, the value of $k$ for which the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation is $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. This means that as $k$ becomes very large, the equilibrium point $\\left(-\\frac{1}{k}, 0\\right)$ undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, and the stability of this point changes."
