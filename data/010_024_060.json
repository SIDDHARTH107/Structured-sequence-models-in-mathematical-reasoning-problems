    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a hyperbolic triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle in radians.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given angles from degrees to radians:\n\n30 degrees = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n60 degrees = 60 * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n90 degrees = 90 * (π/180) = π/2 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem formula:\n\nArea = π - (π/6 + π/3 + π/2)\n\nTo simplify, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\nArea = π - (π(2 + 4 + 6) / 6)\n\nArea = π - (π(12) / 6)\n\nArea = π - (2π)\n\nArea = -π\n\nHowever, we are given that the curvature of the hyperbolic plane is -1.5, not -1. To account for this, we need to multiply the area by the absolute value of the curvature:\n\nArea = -π * |-1.5|\n\nArea = -π * 1.5\n\nArea = -1.5π\n\nSo, the area of the hyperbolic triangle with angles measuring 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees in hyperbolic geometry is -1.5π square units."
