    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal created by recursively removing tetrahedrons from the corners of a larger tetrahedron. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedrons increases by a factor of 4. \n\nTo find the number of tetrahedrons in the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of tetrahedrons = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of tetrahedrons = (4^5 - 1) / 3\nNumber of tetrahedrons = (1024 - 1) / 3\nNumber of tetrahedrons = 1023 / 3\nNumber of tetrahedrons = 341\n\nSo, there are 341 tetrahedrons in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski tetrahedron."
