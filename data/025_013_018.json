    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_5$, we will check each point in the field to see if it satisfies the equation. The field $\\mathbb{F}_5$ has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. We will also include the point at infinity, denoted as $\\mathcal{O}$, which is always on an elliptic curve.\n\nWe will create a table to check each point (x, y) in the field:\n\n| x | y | y^2 | x^3 - 3x + 2 |\n|---|---|-----|---------------|\n| 0 | 0 | 0   | 2             |\n| 0 | 1 | 1   | 2             |\n| 0 | 2 | 4   | 2             |\n| 0 | 3 | 4   | 2             |\n| 0 | 4 | 1   | 2             |\n| 1 | 0 | 0   | 0             |\n| 1 | 1 | 1   | 0             |\n| 1 | 2 | 4   | 0             |\n| 1 | 3 | 4   | 0             |\n| 1 | 4 | 1   | 0             |\n| 2 | 0 | 0   | 3             |\n| 2 | 1 | 1   | 3             |\n| 2 | 2 | 4   | 3             |\n| 2 | 3 | 4   | 3             |\n| 2 | 4 | 1   | 3             |\n| 3 | 0 | 0   | 1             |\n| 3 | 1 | 1   | 1             |\n| 3 | 2 | 4   | 1             |\n| 3 | 3 | 4   | 1             |\n| 3 | 4 | 1   | 1             |\n| 4 | 0 | 0   | 4             |\n| 4 | 1 | 1   | 4             |\n| 4 | 2 | 4   | 4             |\n| 4 | 3 | 4   | 4             |\n| 4 | 4 | 1   | 4             |\n\nNow, we will count the number of points where $y^2$ is equal to $x^3 - 3x + 2$:\n\n- (1, 0)\n- (1, 3)\n- (3, 1)\n- (3, 4)\n- (4, 2)\n- (4, 3)\n\nThere are 6 points in the field that satisfy the equation. Including the point at infinity, there are a total of 7 points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_5$."
