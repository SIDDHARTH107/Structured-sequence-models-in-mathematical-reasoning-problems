    "message_2": "The smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem is 5. \n\nProof:\nFor p = 2, (p-1)! = 1! = 1, which is not congruent to -1 (mod 2).\nFor p = 3, (p-1)! = 2! = 2, which is not congruent to -1 (mod 3).\nFor p = 5, (p-1)! = 4! = 24, which is congruent to -1 (mod 5) since 24 ≡ -1 (mod 5).\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem is 5."
