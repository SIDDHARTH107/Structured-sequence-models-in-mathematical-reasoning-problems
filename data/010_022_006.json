    "message_2": "To maximize the number of non-intersecting tangents from the circle to the square, we need to consider the points where the tangents touch the square. There are 4 corners of the square and 4 midpoints of the sides of the square where tangents can be drawn without intersecting each other.\n\n1. Top-left corner\n2. Top-right corner\n3. Bottom-left corner\n4. Bottom-right corner\n5. Midpoint of the top side\n6. Midpoint of the bottom side\n7. Midpoint of the left side\n8. Midpoint of the right side\n\nSo, the largest number of non-intersecting tangents you can draw from the circle to the square is 8."
