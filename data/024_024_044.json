    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols of the given metric g. The Christoffel symbols are given by:\n\nΓ^k_ij = (1/2) * g^(kl) * (∂g_lj/∂x^i + ∂g_li/∂x^j - ∂g_ij/∂x^l)\n\nHere, g^(kl) is the inverse of the metric tensor g. Since g is diagonal, its inverse is also diagonal with elements being the reciprocal of the diagonal elements of g:\n\ng^(-1) = (1  0)\n         (0  1/2)\n\nNow, let's compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric tensor g is constant, its partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates x^i, x^j, and x^l are all zero. Therefore, all the Christoffel symbols are also zero:\n\nΓ^k_ij = 0 for all i, j, k\n\nThe Cartan connection is given by the matrix of Christoffel symbols:\n\nCartan connection = (Γ^1_ij)  (Γ^2_ij)\n                              = (  0    0  )  (  0    0  )\n                                 (  0    0  )  (  0    0  )\n\nSo, the Cartan connection of M at the point (1,1) is a 2x2 matrix with all elements being zero."
