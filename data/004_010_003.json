    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 5x^4 - 3x^2 + 2, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 5x^4 - 3x^2 + 2, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\nAntiderivative of 5x^4:\nUsing the power rule, the antiderivative of x^4 is (x^(4+1))/(4+1) = x^5/5. So, the antiderivative of 5x^4 is 5(x^5/5) = x^5.\n\nAntiderivative of -3x^2:\nUsing the power rule, the antiderivative of x^2 is (x^(2+1))/(2+1) = x^3/3. So, the antiderivative of -3x^2 is -3(x^3/3) = -x^3.\n\nAntiderivative of 2:\nSince the derivative of a constant is zero, the antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x. So, the antiderivative of 2 is 2x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^5 - x^3 + 2x + C"
