    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, carrying the gene) in n trials (the number of people in the group)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\"\n- p is the probability of success (carrying the gene) for each trial (person)\n- n is the number of trials (people in the group)\n- k is the number of successes (people carrying the gene)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 500 (the number of people in the group)\n- k = 0.8 * 500 = 400 (80% of the people carrying the gene)\n- p = 0.1 (10% of the population carries the gene)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 400) = C(500, 400) * (0.1^400) * (0.9^100)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(500, 400), which is the number of combinations of 500 items taken 400 at a time:\n\nC(500, 400) = 500! / (400! * (500 - 400)!)\nC(500, 400) = 500! / (400! * 100!)\n\nNow we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 400) = (500! / (400! * 100!)) * (0.1^400) * (0.9^100)\n\nThis probability is extremely small and close to zero. It is very unlikely that 80% of a group of 500 people would carry a gene that affects only 10% of the population."
