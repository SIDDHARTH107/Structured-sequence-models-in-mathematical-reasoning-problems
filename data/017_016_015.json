    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 mod 3 and divides 27. The possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 and 27. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal in G, and G is a direct product of its Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are 27 Sylow 3-subgroups. Each Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3, and since the group is of order 27, there are 27 elements of order 3 in total. If G is abelian, then by the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, G is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order. Since 27 = 3^3, G would be isomorphic to C3 × C3 × C3, C9 × C3, or C27. However, in each of these cases, there are not 27 elements of order 3:\n\n- In C3 × C3 × C3, there are 8 elements of order 3.\n- In C9 × C3, there are 6 elements of order 3.\n- In C27, there are 9 elements of order 3.\n\nSince none of these cases have 27 elements of order 3, G cannot be abelian. Therefore, G must be the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn summary, if there are 27 elements of order 3 in the group, then the group is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27. If there are fewer than 27 elements of order 3, then the group is isomorphic to C27."
