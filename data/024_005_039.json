    "message_1": "Consider the surface given by the equation:\n\nz = x^2 + y^2 + 3xy \n\nDetermine the principal curvatures of this surface at the point (1, 1, 5).",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the surface equation.\n\nGiven the surface equation z = x^2 + y^2 + 3xy, we can find the tangent plane at the point (1, 1, 5) by computing the gradient of z:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x + 3y\n∂z/∂y = 2y + 3x\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 5), the gradient is:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2(1) + 3(1) = 5\n∂z/∂y = 2(1) + 3(1) = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 3\n\nNow, we can compute the first fundamental form (E, F, G) and the second fundamental form (L, M, N):\n\nE = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 = 1 + 5^2 = 26\nF = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y) = 5 * 5 = 25\nG = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2 = 1 + 5^2 = 26\n\nL = ∂²z/∂x² = 2\nM = ∂²z/∂x∂y = 3\nN = ∂²z/∂y² = 2\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the following equation:\n\n(EG - F^2)(k1 * k2) = LN - M^2\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n(26 * 26 - 25^2)(k1 * k2) = 2 * 2 - 3^2\n(676 - 625)(k1 * k2) = 4 - 9\n51(k1 * k2) = -5\n\nk1 * k2 = -5/51\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by the first and second fundamental forms:\n\n| L - λ  M |\n| M   N - λ |\n\n| 2 - λ  3 |\n| 3   2 - λ |\n\n(2 - λ)(2 - λ) - 3 * 3 = 0\nλ^2 - 4λ + 4 - 9 = 0\nλ^2 - 4λ - 5 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get the eigenvalues λ1 = 5 and λ2 = -1. These eigenvalues are the principal curvatures k1 and k2:\n\nk1 = 5\nk2 = -1\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1, 1, 5) are 5 and -1."
