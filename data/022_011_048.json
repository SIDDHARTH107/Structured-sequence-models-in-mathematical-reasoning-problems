    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function $f(z)$, we need to solve the equation $f(z) = 0$. However, since the numerator is a constant, there are no zeros for this function.\n\nTo find the poles of the function $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator is equal to zero. So, we need to solve the quadratic equation $z^2 + 5z + 6 = 0$. We can factor this equation as follows:\n\n$(z + 2)(z + 3) = 0$\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n\n1. $z = -2$\n2. $z = -3$\n\nThese are the locations of the poles in the complex plane. Since each pole comes from a linear factor in the denominator, both poles have order 1.\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2 + 5z + 6}$ has no zeros and two poles of order 1 located at $z = -2$ and $z = -3$ in the complex plane."
