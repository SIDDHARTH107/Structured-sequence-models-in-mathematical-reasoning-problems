    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard measuring 20 inches by 15 inches is to be made into a box with an open top by cutting equal size squares from each corner and folding up the sides. What should be the length of the side of each square cut out so that the volume of the box is maximum?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the side of each square cut out from the corners. After cutting out the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 20 - 2x\nWidth: 15 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be calculated as the product of its length, width, and height:\n\nV(x) = (20 - 2x)(15 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the function V(x) by taking its first derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (20 - 4x)(15 - 2x) - (20 - 2x)(2x) = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n300 - 100x + 8x^2 - 40x + 4x^2 = 0\n12x^2 - 140x + 300 = 0\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n3x^2 - 35x + 75 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the critical points:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (35 ± √(35^2 - 4*3*75)) / (2*3)\n\nx ≈ 2.5, 10\n\nSince x must be less than half of the smaller dimension (15 inches) of the cardboard, we can discard the solution x = 10. Therefore, the length of the side of each square cut out should be approximately 2.5 inches to maximize the volume of the box."
