    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime number squared (5^2), we can apply the following result from group theory:\n\nFor any prime number p, every group of order p^2 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nIn our case, p = 5. So, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nTo determine which case holds, we can use the fact that a group of order p^2 has exactly one subgroup of order p for each divisor of p^2. In our case, the divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25.\n\nSince G has order 25, it has a subgroup of order 25, which is G itself. By Sylow's theorem, G has at least one Sylow 5-subgroup (a subgroup of order 5). Let H be one such subgroup. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H is cyclic. Thus, H is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C_5.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups. By Sylow's theorem, n_5 must divide the order of G (which is 25), and n_5 must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 5.\n\nIf n_5 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, and G is cyclic (isomorphic to C_25).\n\nIf n_5 = 5, then there are 5 distinct Sylow 5-subgroups. Let K be another Sylow 5-subgroup different from H. Since H and K are both of order 5, they are both cyclic and isomorphic to C_5. Moreover, since the intersection of H and K is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element), we can form the direct product of H and K, denoted as H x K. This direct product is a subgroup of G with order 5 * 5 = 25, which means G is isomorphic to H x K, the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. Without more information about G, we cannot determine which case holds."
