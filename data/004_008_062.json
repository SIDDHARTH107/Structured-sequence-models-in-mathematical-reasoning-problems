    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent to the curve y = 2x^2 + 3 at x = 4, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 4.\n\nThe function is y = 2x^2 + 3. \n\nFirst, find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(2x^2 + 3)/dx = 4x (using the power rule)\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = 4:\n\ndy/dx (x=4) = 4(4) = 16\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent to the curve y = 2x^2 + 3 at x = 4 is 16."
