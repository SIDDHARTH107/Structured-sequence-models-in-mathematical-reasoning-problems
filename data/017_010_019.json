    "message_2": "A non-abelian group of order 10 has 10 elements. The order of an element divides the order of the group by Lagrange's theorem. Since 10 = 2 * 5, the possible element orders for a group of order 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. However, the identity element is the only element with order 1, and if all other elements have orders 2 or 5, the group would be abelian, which contradicts the assumption that the group is non-abelian.\n\nTherefore, a non-abelian group of order 10 must have at least one element of order 10. So the possible element orders for a non-abelian group of order 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10."
