    "message_1": "A population of rabbits is introduced to a new environment where they have access to abundant food and no natural predators. The population is proportional to the current population size and the rate of growth is 0.5 rabbits per week. If there are 10 rabbits initially, how many will there be after 8 weeks?",
    "message_2": "We can use the exponential growth formula to solve this problem:\n\nFinal population = Initial population * (1 + growth rate) ^ time\n\nIn this case, the initial population is 10 rabbits, the growth rate is 0.5 (or 50% as a decimal, which is 0.5), and the time is 8 weeks.\n\nFinal population = 10 * (1 + 0.5) ^ 8\nFinal population = 10 * (1.5) ^ 8\nFinal population = 10 * 25.62890625\nFinal population â‰ˆ 256.29\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, after 8 weeks, there will be approximately 257 rabbits in the population."
