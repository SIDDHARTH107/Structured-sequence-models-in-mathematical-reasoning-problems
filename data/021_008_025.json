    "message_2": "To use Newton's method, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = cos(x) + 2x - 2. The derivative, f'(x), is given by:\n\nf'(x) = -sin(x) + 2\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method using the formula:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nWe start with an initial guess of x_0 = 1. Let's perform a few iterations to find the positive root:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - (cos(x_0) + 2x_0 - 2) / (-sin(x_0) + 2)\nx_1 = 1 - (cos(1) + 2(1) - 2) / (-sin(1) + 2)\nx_1 ≈ 0.7503638678\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = x_1 - (cos(x_1) + 2x_1 - 2) / (-sin(x_1) + 2)\nx_2 ≈ 0.7503638678 - (cos(0.7503638678) + 2(0.7503638678) - 2) / (-sin(0.7503638678) + 2)\nx_2 ≈ 0.7391128909\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 = x_2 - (cos(x_2) + 2x_2 - 2) / (-sin(x_2) + 2)\nx_3 ≈ 0.7391128909 - (cos(0.7391128909) + 2(0.7391128909) - 2) / (-sin(0.7391128909) + 2)\nx_3 ≈ 0.7390851332\n\nAfter 3 iterations, we have x_3 ≈ 0.7390851332. We can continue iterating to get a more accurate result, but this is already quite close to the positive root. Therefore, the positive root of the equation cos(x) + 2x - 2 = 0 is approximately 0.7390851332."
