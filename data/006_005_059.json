    "message_1": "A factory produces 2000 widgets per day with a defect rate of 2%. What is the probability of producing exactly 40 defective widgets in a given day?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x successes (defective widgets in this case) in n trials (total widgets produced)\n- n is the number of trials (total widgets produced)\n- x is the number of successes (defective widgets)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, also written as C(n, x) or \"n choose x\"\n- p is the probability of success (defect rate)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (non-defective rate)\n\nIn this problem:\n- n = 2000 (total widgets produced per day)\n- x = 40 (defective widgets)\n- p = 0.02 (2% defect rate)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(40) = C(2000, 40) * (0.02^40) * (0.98^1960)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(2000, 40), which is the number of combinations of 2000 items taken 40 at a time:\n\nC(2000, 40) = 2000! / (40! * (2000-40)!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorials and the combinations, we get:\n\nC(2000, 40) ≈ 1.228e+48\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(40) ≈ 1.228e+48 * (0.02^40) * (0.98^1960)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the probabilities, we get:\n\nP(40) ≈ 0.0436\n\nSo, the probability of producing exactly 40 defective widgets in a given day is approximately 4.36%."
