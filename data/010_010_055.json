    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3x + y^2$, we first need to find the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y\n$$\n\nNow, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n3x^2 - 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm 1\n$$\n\n$$\n2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0\n$$\n\nSo, we have two critical points: $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.\n\nNext, we need to find the second partial derivatives to determine the Hessian matrix:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0\n$$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$$\nH = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian matrix at the critical points:\n\nFor $(1,0)$:\n\n$$\nH(1,0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(H(1,0)) = 6 \\cdot 2 = 12 > 0$. Since the determinant is positive and the second partial derivative with respect to $x$ is positive, this critical point is a local minimum.\n\nFor $(-1,0)$:\n\n$$\nH(-1,0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-6 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(H(-1,0)) = -6 \\cdot 2 = -12 < 0$. Since the determinant is negative, this critical point is a saddle point.\n\nIn conclusion, we have two critical points: $(1,0)$ is a local minimum, and $(-1,0)$ is a saddle point."
