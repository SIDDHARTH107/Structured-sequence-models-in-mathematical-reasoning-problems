    "message_2": "To find the intersection of the two planes, we first need to check if they are parallel or not. If the planes are parallel, they will not intersect, and the number of intersection points will be zero. If they are not parallel, they will intersect in a line, and the number of intersection points will be infinite.\n\nTo check if the planes are parallel, we can compare the normal vectors of the planes. The normal vector of a plane is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane, and its components are the coefficients of the variables in the equation of the plane.\n\nFor Plane 1, the normal vector is N1 = (2, 3, -1).\nFor Plane 2, the normal vector is N2 = (1, -1, 3).\n\nNow, we can check if these normal vectors are parallel by calculating their cross product. If the cross product is a zero vector, the normal vectors are parallel, and so are the planes.\n\nN1 x N2 = (3*(-1) - (-1)*3, -1*1 - 2*3, 2*(-1) - 1*3)\nN1 x N2 = (-3 + 3, -1 - 6, -2 - 3)\nN1 x N2 = (0, -7, -5)\n\nThe cross product is not a zero vector, which means the normal vectors are not parallel, and therefore, the planes are not parallel. Since the planes are not parallel, they will intersect in a line.\n\nNow, let's use Bezout's theorem to justify our answer. Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counting multiplicity and intersections at infinity, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nIn our case, both planes are linear, which means their degrees are 1. The product of their degrees is 1 * 1 = 1. However, since the planes intersect in a line, the number of intersection points is infinite, not 1. This apparent contradiction is resolved by the fact that the intersection line is a common component of both planes, which is not counted in Bezout's theorem.\n\nSo, the number of points where the two planes intersect is infinite."
