    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem related to the chaotic behavior of the double pendulum:\n\nGiven a double pendulum of length L1 = 1 meter and L2 = 0.5 meters, with masses m1 = 2 kg and m2 = 1 kg respectively, assume the initial angular positions are θ1 = 0.1 radians and θ2 = 0.05 radians, and the initial angular velocities are ω1 = 0 and ω2 = 0. Calculate the time period and the maximum amplitude of the motion for the first minute of the system.",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum is a complex system with non-linear equations of motion, so we cannot find an exact analytical solution for the time period and maximum amplitude. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the behavior of the system.\n\nWe will use the Lagrangian method to derive the equations of motion and then solve them numerically. The Lagrangian L is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy T and the potential energy V:\n\nL = T - V\n\nThe kinetic energy T and potential energy V for the double pendulum are given by:\n\nT = 0.5 * m1 * (L1^2 * ω1^2) + 0.5 * m2 * (L1^2 * ω1^2 + L2^2 * ω2^2 + 2 * L1 * L2 * ω1 * ω2 * cos(θ1 - θ2))\nV = -m1 * g * L1 * cos(θ1) - m2 * g * (L1 * cos(θ1) + L2 * cos(θ2))\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to θ1, θ2, ω1, and ω2. Then, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the equations of motion:\n\nd(L)/dθ1 - d/dt(d(L)/dω1) = 0\nd(L)/dθ2 - d/dt(d(L)/dω2) = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get two coupled second-order differential equations for θ1 and θ2. To solve these numerically, we can use a method like the Runge-Kutta method or the Verlet method.\n\nOnce we have the numerical solution for θ1(t) and θ2(t), we can find the time period by looking for the time it takes for the system to return to a similar state. However, due to the chaotic nature of the double pendulum, the time period may not be well-defined, and the motion may not be periodic.\n\nTo find the maximum amplitude, we can calculate the maximum displacement of the end of the second pendulum from its initial position during the first minute of the motion. This can be done by finding the maximum value of the function:\n\nsqrt((L1 * sin(θ1) + L2 * sin(θ2))^2 + (L1 * cos(θ1) + L2 * cos(θ2))^2)\n\nduring the first minute of the motion.\n\nTo summarize, we cannot find an exact analytical solution for the time period and maximum amplitude of the double pendulum. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the behavior of the system and find these values."
