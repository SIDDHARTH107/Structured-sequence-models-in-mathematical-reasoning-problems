    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = cos(3x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if you have a composite function, like y = f(g(x)), then the derivative of y with respect to x is the derivative of f with respect to g times the derivative of g with respect to x, or dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nIn our case, y = cos(3x), so we have f(u) = cos(u) and g(x) = 3x. We'll first find the derivatives of f and g:\n\nf'(u) = -sin(u)\ng'(x) = 3\n\nNow we'll apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\ndy/dx = -sin(3x) * 3\n\nNow we'll find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = -sin(3(π/4)) * 3\ndy/dx(π/4) = -sin(3π/4) * 3\n\nsin(3π/4) = sin(π/4) = √2/2 (since 3π/4 is in the second quadrant where sine is positive)\n\nSo,\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = -(√2/2) * 3\ndy/dx(π/4) = -3√2/2"
