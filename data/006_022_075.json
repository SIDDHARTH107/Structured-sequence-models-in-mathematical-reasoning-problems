    "message_1": "In a school, 60% of the students pass the yearly math exam, while 40% fail. If a random sample of 10 students is selected from the school, what is the probability that more than 7 of them passed the math exam?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (students passing the math exam) in n trials (students selected)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (passing the math exam)\n- n is the number of trials (students selected)\n- k is the number of successes (students passing the math exam)\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (number of students selected), p = 0.6 (probability of passing the math exam), and we want to find the probability of more than 7 students passing the math exam, which means we need to find the probabilities for 8, 9, and 10 students passing and then sum them up.\n\nFor 8 students passing:\nk = 8\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.6^8 * 0.4^2\n\nFor 9 students passing:\nk = 9\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.6^9 * 0.4^1\n\nFor 10 students passing:\nk = 10\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.6^10 * 0.4^0\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probabilities and sum them up:\n\nC(10, 8) = 45\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.6^8 * 0.4^2 ≈ 0.120932\n\nC(10, 9) = 10\nP(X = 9) = 10 * 0.6^9 * 0.4^1 ≈ 0.040310\n\nC(10, 10) = 1\nP(X = 10) = 1 * 0.6^10 * 0.4^0 ≈ 0.006047\n\nThe probability of more than 7 students passing the math exam is the sum of these probabilities:\n\nP(X > 7) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) ≈ 0.120932 + 0.040310 + 0.006047 ≈ 0.167289\n\nSo, the probability that more than 7 students in the random sample of 10 passed the math exam is approximately 16.73%."
