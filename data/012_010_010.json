    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. In other words, every edge is \"covered\" by a vertex in the set.\n\nFor the given graph, the minimum number of vertices needed to form a vertex cover is 2. One possible vertex cover is {B, C}. This covers all the edges:\n\n- A--B is covered by B\n- A--C is covered by C\n- B--D is covered by B\n- C--D is covered by C\n\nAnother possible vertex cover is {A, D}. This also covers all the edges:\n\n- A--B is covered by A\n- A--C is covered by A\n- B--D is covered by D\n- C--D is covered by D\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices needed to form a vertex cover for the given graph is 2."
