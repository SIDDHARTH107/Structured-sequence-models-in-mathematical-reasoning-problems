    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to signaling games in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose there are two players, a sender and a receiver, in a signaling game. The sender can either choose to send a \"high\" signal with a 60% chance or a \"low\" signal with a 40% chance. The receiver must make a decision based on the signal received. If the receiver receives a \"high\" signal, they can choose either \"yes\" or \"no\" with equal probability. If the receiver receives a \"low\" signal, they can choose \"yes\" with a 25% probability and \"no\" with a 75% probability.\n\nWhat is the expected payoff for the sender if the receiver always chooses \"yes\" when given the chance?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected payoff for the sender, we need to consider the probabilities of each possible outcome. Since the receiver always chooses \"yes\" when given the chance, we only need to consider the probabilities of the sender sending a \"high\" or \"low\" signal and the receiver choosing \"yes\" in response.\n\n1. Sender sends a \"high\" signal (60% chance) and receiver chooses \"yes\" (50% chance):\nProbability = 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3\n\n2. Sender sends a \"low\" signal (40% chance) and receiver chooses \"yes\" (25% chance):\nProbability = 0.4 * 0.25 = 0.1\n\nNow, let's assume the payoffs for the sender are as follows:\n- If the sender sends a \"high\" signal and the receiver chooses \"yes,\" the sender gets a payoff of X.\n- If the sender sends a \"low\" signal and the receiver chooses \"yes,\" the sender gets a payoff of Y.\n\nThe expected payoff for the sender can be calculated as follows:\nExpected Payoff = (Probability of High Signal and Yes) * X + (Probability of Low Signal and Yes) * Y\nExpected Payoff = (0.3 * X) + (0.1 * Y)\n\nWithout knowing the specific values of X and Y, we cannot provide a numerical value for the expected payoff. However, the formula above can be used to calculate the expected payoff once the values of X and Y are known."
