The supply capacity for each factory and the demand for each warehouse is shown in the table below:\n\n| Factory | Supply (in units) | Warehouse | Demand (in units) |\n|---------|------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| F1      | 100              | W1        | 80                 |\n| F1      | 120              | W2        | 60                 |\n| F2      | 70                | W3        | 120                |\n| F3      | 80                | W4        | 100                |\n| F4      | 110              | W5        | 70                 |\n\nThe transportation cost per unit between each factory and warehouse is given in the following matrix:\n\n|       | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 | W5 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|----|\n| F1 | 12 | 8  | 10 | 11 | 15 |\n| F2 | 7  | 9  | 13 | 10 | 14 |\n| F3 | 10 | 14 | 16 | 11 | 8  |\n| F4 | 9  | 8  | 10 | 13 | 10 |\n| F5 | 13 | 10 | 9  | 14 | 12 |\n\nThe company wants to minimize the total transportation cost while fulfilling the demand of each warehouse and not exceeding the supply capacity of each factory.

    "message_2": "To find the optimal shipping plan, we can use the transportation algorithm. The transportation algorithm is an optimization technique used to minimize the cost of transporting goods from sources (factories) to destinations (warehouses) while fulfilling the demand of each warehouse and not exceeding the supply capacity of each factory.\n\nFirst, we need to balance the supply and demand. The total supply is 480 units (100 + 120 + 70 + 80 + 110) and the total demand is 430 units (80 + 60 + 120 + 100 + 70). Since the total supply is greater than the total demand, we need to add a dummy warehouse (W6) with a demand of 50 units and a transportation cost of 0 for each factory.\n\nNow, we can apply the transportation algorithm using the Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) to find the initial feasible solution.\n\n1. Calculate the penalty cost for each row and column by subtracting the smallest cost from the second smallest cost.\n2. Select the row or column with the highest penalty cost.\n3. Allocate the maximum possible units to the cell with the lowest cost in the selected row or column.\n4. Cross out the row or column that has its supply or demand fulfilled.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all supplies and demands are fulfilled.\n\nApplying VAM, we get the following initial feasible solution:\n\n|       | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 | W5 | W6 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| F1 | 80 | 20 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| F2 |  0 |  0 | 70 |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| F3 |  0 |  0 |  0 | 80 |  0 |  0 |\n| F4 |  0 | 40 |  0 |  0 | 70 |  0 |\n| F5 |  0 |  0 | 50 | 20 |  0 | 40 |\n\nNow, we can calculate the total transportation cost:\n\n(80 * 12) + (20 * 8) + (70 * 13) + (80 * 11) + (40 * 8) + (70 * 10) + (50 * 9) + (20 * 14) = 960 + 160 + 910 + 880 + 320 + 700 + 450 + 280 = 4660\n\nThe optimal shipping plan is:\n\n- F1 to W1: 80 units\n- F1 to W2: 20 units\n- F2 to W3: 70 units\n- F3 to W4: 80 units\n- F4 to W2: 40 units\n- F4 to W5: 70 units\n- F5 to W3: 50 units\n- F5 to W4: 20 units\n\nThe minimum total transportation cost is 4660."
