    "message_2": "There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 60. Here is the list of these groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_60\nThis is the group of integers modulo 60 under addition. It has a single generator, for example, 1, and every element can be expressed as a multiple of the generator.\n\n2. Dihedral group: D_30\nThis is the group of symmetries of a regular 30-gon, including rotations and reflections. It has 30 rotational symmetries and 30 reflectional symmetries, making a total of 60 elements.\n\n3. The direct product of C_3 and S_4: C_3 × S_4\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 (C_3) and the symmetric group on 4 elements (S_4). It has 3 × 24 = 60 elements.\n\n4. The direct product of C_5 and A_4: C_5 × A_4\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of the cyclic group of order 5 (C_5) and the alternating group on 4 elements (A_4). It has 5 × 12 = 60 elements.\n\n5. The direct product of C_15 and D_2: C_15 × D_2\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of the cyclic group of order 15 (C_15) and the dihedral group of order 4 (D_2). It has 15 × 4 = 60 elements.\n\nThese are all the non-isomorphic groups of order 60."
