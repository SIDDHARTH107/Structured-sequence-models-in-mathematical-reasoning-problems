    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor, while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor. The company has 300 hours of machine time and 240 hours of labor available per week. The profit for each unit of Product A is $10 and for each unit of Product B is $15. What is the maximum weekly profit that the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and labor are as follows:\n\nMachine time: 3x + 2y ≤ 300\nLabor: 2x + 4y ≤ 240\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraints for y:\n\nFrom the machine time constraint:\ny ≤ (300 - 3x) / 2\n\nFrom the labor constraint:\ny ≤ (240 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow we'll find the corner points of the feasible region by setting the inequalities as equalities and solving the system of equations:\n\n1) 3x + 2y = 300\n2) 2x + 4y = 240\n\nWe can multiply equation 1 by 2 to match the coefficients of y in both equations:\n\n6x + 4y = 600\n\nNow subtract equation 2 from the modified equation 1:\n\n(6x + 4y) - (2x + 4y) = 600 - 240\n4x = 360\nx = 90\n\nNow substitute x = 90 into equation 2 to find y:\n\n2(90) + 4y = 240\n180 + 4y = 240\n4y = 60\ny = 15\n\nSo the corner point is (90, 15). Since this is the only intersection point of the two constraints, this is the optimal solution.\n\nNow we can find the maximum weekly profit:\n\nP(90, 15) = 10(90) + 15(15) = 900 + 225 = $1125\n\nThe maximum weekly profit the company can earn is $1125."
