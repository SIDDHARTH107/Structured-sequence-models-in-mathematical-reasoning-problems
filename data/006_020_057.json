    "message_1": "In a community of 1000 people, 30% are under the age of 18, 50% are between 18-40 years old, and the remaining are above 40. If you randomly select 3 individuals from the community, what is the probability that all 3 are above 40 years old?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many people are above 40 years old in the community. Since 30% are under 18 and 50% are between 18-40, that means 100% - 30% - 50% = 20% of the community is above 40 years old.\n\nThere are 1000 people in the community, so there are 1000 * 0.20 = 200 people above 40 years old.\n\nNow, we will calculate the probability of selecting 3 individuals above 40 years old. The probability of selecting the first person above 40 is 200/1000 = 1/5.\n\nAfter selecting the first person, there are 999 people left in the community and 199 people above 40 years old. The probability of selecting the second person above 40 is 199/999.\n\nAfter selecting the second person, there are 998 people left in the community and 198 people above 40 years old. The probability of selecting the third person above 40 is 198/998.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting all 3 individuals above 40 years old is (1/5) * (199/999) * (198/998).\n\nMultiplying these probabilities together, we get:\n\n(1/5) * (199/999) * (198/998) = 0.20 * 0.199199 * 0.198396 = 0.007920\n\nTherefore, the probability that all 3 randomly selected individuals are above 40 years old is approximately 0.79%."
