    "message_1": "Let's say there are five subjects that a student can choose from, and each subject has two teachers. The student knows that one teacher in one of the subjects always speaks truth and the other teacher always lies. The student can ask only one question to figure out which teacher always speaks truth. \n\nWhat is the question the student should ask?",
    "message_2": "The student should ask the following question to one of the teachers: \"If I were to ask the other teacher in your subject if they are the one who always tells the truth, what would they say?\"\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n\n1. If the student is asking the truthful teacher, the truthful teacher would honestly say that the lying teacher would claim to be the one who always tells the truth.\n\n2. If the student is asking the lying teacher, the lying teacher would falsely say that the truthful teacher would also claim that the lying teacher is the one who always tells the truth.\n\nIn both cases, the answer would be that the other teacher would claim to be the one who always tells the truth. Therefore, the student can deduce that the teacher who gives this answer is actually the one who always lies, and the other teacher in that subject is the one who always tells the truth."
