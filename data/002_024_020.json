    "message_1": "A trapezium has a base of 12 cm and 18 cm, with a height of 7 cm. Find its perimeter.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides (the non-parallel sides). Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of each of these sides. Since the trapezium is not necessarily an isosceles trapezium, we cannot assume that the two non-parallel sides are equal in length. Therefore, we need to find the length of the two triangles formed by the height and the difference in the base lengths.\n\nLet's call the difference in base lengths x, so x = 18 - 12 = 6 cm. Now, we have two right triangles with height 7 cm and base x/2 = 3 cm each.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\na^2 = (x/2)^2 + height^2\na^2 = 3^2 + 7^2\na^2 = 9 + 49\na^2 = 58\na = √58\n\nSince both non-parallel sides are congruent in this case (due to the trapezium being symmetrical), we have:\n\nb = a = √58\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter by adding all the side lengths:\n\nPerimeter = base1 + base2 + a + b\nPerimeter = 12 + 18 + √58 + √58\nPerimeter = 30 + 2√58\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 30 + 2√58 cm."
