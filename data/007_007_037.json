    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation 3x + 7y = 25, we can first find one particular solution and then use the general form of the solutions for a linear Diophantine equation.\n\nStep 1: Find one particular solution\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution. However, in this case, we can find one by trial and error:\n\nLet x = 1, then the equation becomes 3(1) + 7y = 25, which simplifies to 7y = 22. Now, let y = 2, we get 7(2) = 14, and 3x = 25 - 14 = 11, so x = 11/3, which is not an integer.\n\nLet x = 2, then the equation becomes 3(2) + 7y = 25, which simplifies to 7y = 19. This doesn't yield an integer solution for y.\n\nLet x = 3, then the equation becomes 3(3) + 7y = 25, which simplifies to 7y = 16. Now, let y = 2, we get 7(2) = 14, and 3x = 25 - 14 = 11, so x = 3.\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x, y) = (3, 2).\n\nStep 2: Use the general form of the solutions\nThe general form of the solutions for a linear Diophantine equation of the form ax + by = c is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, d = gcd(a, b), and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 7, and c = 25. The gcd(3, 7) = 1 (since 3 and 7 are both prime numbers). Our particular solution is (x0, y0) = (3, 2).\n\nSo, the general form of the solutions is:\n\nx = 3 + 7n\ny = 2 - 3n\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for n:\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (3, 2)\nn = 1: (x, y) = (10, -1)\nn = -1: (x, y) = (-4, 5)\n\nThese are the integer solutions for the given Diophantine equation."
