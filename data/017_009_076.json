    "message_1": "Let G be a group of order 9. If we know that G is non-abelian, then how many non-identity elements of G must have order 3?",
    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 9, we know that |G| = 9. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nSince G is non-abelian, it cannot be a cyclic group. If it were cyclic, it would be isomorphic to Z_9, which is abelian. Therefore, G cannot have an element of order 9.\n\nThe identity element of G has order 1, so there are 8 non-identity elements left. Since there are no elements of order 9, all non-identity elements must have order 3.\n\nThus, there are 8 non-identity elements of G with order 3."
