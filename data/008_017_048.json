    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first represent the given system of equations as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  1  2 |\n    | 2  3  4 |\n    | 1  2  1 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 14 |\n    | 20 |\n    |  8 |\n\nNow, we convert the matrix A into a sparse matrix representation. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the matrix A is already sparse since it has no zero elements. Therefore, we can proceed with solving the system of equations using the given matrix A.\n\nTo solve the system of equations Ax = b, we can use the following methods:\n\n1. Gaussian elimination\n2. LU decomposition\n3. Matrix inversion\n\nFor this problem, we will use Gaussian elimination.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third equations.\n\nDivide the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the second equation:\n\n(2 - 2/3) * (2x + 3y + 4z) - (3y + 4z) = 20 - 14 * 2/3\n\n(4/3)x + y + 8/3z = 4\n\nSubtract the first equation from the third equation:\n\n(-2x + y - z) = -6\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third equation.\n\nDivide the second equation by 4/3 and subtract it from the third equation:\n\n(3 - 4/3) * (-2x + y - z) - (y - 8/3z) = -6 - 4 * 4/3\n\n-2x + z = -4\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nz = 2\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\ny = 2\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nx = 3\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 2, and z = 2."
