    "message_2": "To find the value of x in the equation 3^x ≡ 2 (mod 7), we can use trial and error to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's try different values of x:\n\n1. x = 0: 3^0 ≡ 1 (mod 7) (not equal to 2)\n2. x = 1: 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 7) (not equal to 2)\n3. x = 2: 3^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7) (equal to 2)\n\nSo, the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies the equation is x = 2."
