The sales data for the months January-December are given in the following table:\n\n| Month | Sales (in thousands) |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| Jan   | 10                   |\n| Feb   | 12                   |\n| Mar   | 15                   |\n| Apr   | 18                   |\n| May   | 21                   |\n| Jun   | 25                   |\n| Jul   | 30                   |\n| Aug   | 28                   |\n| Sep   | 24                   |\n| Oct   | 20                   |\n| Nov   | 14                   |\n| Dec   | 12                   |\n\nUsing the seasonal naive method, calculate the forecast for the sales for January of the next year, assuming that the seasonal component for January is the same as that for January in the previous year.",
    "message_2": "The seasonal naive method assumes that the seasonal component for a given month is the same as that for the same month in the previous year. In this case, the store owner wants to forecast the sales for January of the next year.\n\nSince the sales data for January of the previous year is given as 10 (in thousands), the forecast for the sales for January of the next year using the seasonal naive method would also be 10 (in thousands)."
