    "message_2": "Let's consider the function $g(z) = f(z) - f(\\bar{z})$. We have $g(\\bar{z}) = f(\\bar{z}) - f(z) = \\overline{f(z)} - \\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = -\\overline{g(z)}$. Since $g(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane and its imaginary part is the negative of its imaginary part in the lower half-plane, we can apply the Schwarz reflection principle to extend $g(z)$ to an entire function on the whole complex plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $h(z) = g(z) - g(-z)$. We have $h(-z) = g(-z) - g(z) = -g(z) + g(-z) = -h(z)$. Since $h(z)$ is an entire function and it is odd, we can write its Taylor series around $0$ as $h(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{2n+1} z^{2n+1}$, where $a_{2n+1}$ are the Taylor coefficients.\n\nNow, let's go back to the function $f(z)$. We have $f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(g(z) + g(\\bar{z})) = \\frac{1}{2}(h(z) + h(\\bar{z}))$. Since $f(0) = 1$, we have $a_1 = 1$. Also, $f(i) = 2i$, so we have $2i = \\frac{1}{2}(h(i) + h(-i)) = \\frac{1}{2}(a_1 i - a_1 i + a_3 i^3 - a_3 i^3 + \\cdots) = a_3 i$. Thus, $a_3 = 2$.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is analytic, all other Taylor coefficients must be zero. Therefore, we have $f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(z + 2z^3)$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$."
