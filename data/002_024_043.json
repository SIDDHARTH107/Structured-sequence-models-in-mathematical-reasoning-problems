    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, you simply need to add the lengths of all four sides together. \n\nThe parallel sides have lengths of 5 cm and 10 cm, and the non-parallel sides have lengths of 6 cm and 7 cm. \n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is:\n\n5 cm + 10 cm + 6 cm + 7 cm = 28 cm"
