    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA population of rabbits initially has 500 individuals and is growing according to a logistic growth model. The carrying capacity of the environment is 2000 rabbits, and the growth rate parameter is 0.3. \n\na) Write the differential equation that models the population growth of the rabbits.\nb) Find the general solution to the differential equation.\nc) Use the initial condition to find the particular solution to the differential equation.\nd) What is the expected population size after 5 years?",
    "message_2": "a) The logistic growth model is given by the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = r * P * (1 - P/K)\n\nwhere P is the population size, r is the growth rate parameter, and K is the carrying capacity. In this case, r = 0.3 and K = 2000. So the differential equation is:\n\ndP/dt = 0.3 * P * (1 - P/2000)\n\nb) To find the general solution, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP / (P * (1 - P/2000)) = 0.3 * dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/P + 1/(2000 - P)) dP = ∫0.3 dt\n\n-ln|P| + ln|2000 - P| = 0.3t + C\n\nln| (2000 - P) / P | = 0.3t + C\n\n(2000 - P) / P = Ae^(0.3t) , where A = e^C\n\nc) To find the particular solution, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 500:\n\n(2000 - 500) / 500 = Ae^(0.3 * 0)\n\n1500 / 500 = A\n\nA = 3\n\nSo the particular solution is:\n\n(2000 - P) / P = 3e^(0.3t)\n\nd) To find the expected population size after 5 years, we can plug t = 5 into the particular solution:\n\n(2000 - P) / P = 3e^(0.3 * 5)\n\n(2000 - P) / P = 3e^(1.5)\n\nNow we can solve for P:\n\n2000 - P = 3Pe^(1.5)\n\n2000 = P(1 + 3e^(1.5))\n\nP = 2000 / (1 + 3e^(1.5))\n\nP ≈ 1620.6\n\nSo the expected population size after 5 years is approximately 1620 rabbits."
