    "message_1": "Consider the following nonlinear equation:\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 2*x - 2 = 0\n\nFind the root of the equation accurate to four decimal places using the Newton-Raphson method. Take the initial guess as x0 = 2.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe are given the initial guess x0 = 2. Now, we will iterate using the Newton-Raphson formula until the difference between consecutive approximations is less than 0.0001 (to get accuracy up to four decimal places).\n\nIteration 1:\nx0 = 2\nf(x0) = 2^3 - 2*2 - 2 = 8 - 4 - 2 = 2\nf'(x0) = 3*(2^2) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) = 2 - 2/10 = 2 - 0.2 = 1.8\n\nIteration 2:\nx0 = 1.8\nf(x0) = 1.8^3 - 2*1.8 - 2 ≈ -0.072\nf'(x0) = 3*(1.8^2) - 2 ≈ 8.76\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) ≈ 1.8 - (-0.072) / 8.76 ≈ 1.807\n\nIteration 3:\nx0 = 1.807\nf(x0) ≈ 0.001\nf'(x0) ≈ 9.04\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) ≈ 1.807 - 0.001 / 9.04 ≈ 1.8069\n\nSince the difference between the last two approximations is less than 0.0001, we can stop here. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2 = 0 accurate to four decimal places is approximately x ≈ 1.8069."
