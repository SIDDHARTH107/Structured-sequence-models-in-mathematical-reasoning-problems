    "message_1": "A math student needs to determine the length of a side in an equilateral triangle with a perimeter of 30 meters. What is the length of each side of the equilateral triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we need to divide the perimeter by the number of sides. An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides.\n\nPerimeter = 30 meters\nNumber of sides = 3\n\nLength of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides = 30 meters / 3 = 10 meters\n\nEach side of the equilateral triangle is 10 meters long."
