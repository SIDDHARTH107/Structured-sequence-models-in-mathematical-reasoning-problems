    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Hill Cipher with the given 2x2 key matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the letters of the message to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n   H -> 7, E -> 4, L -> 11, L -> 11, O -> 14\n\n2. Since we have a 2x2 key matrix, we need to break the message into pairs of letters. If the message has an odd number of letters, we can add an extra letter (usually 'X' or 'Z') to make it even. In this case, the message is already even, so we don't need to add any extra letters.\n   (H, E), (L, L), (O, _)\n\n3. Multiply each pair of letters (represented as numerical values) by the key matrix and take the result modulo 26.\n   Encrypted pair = (Key matrix) * (Message pair) mod 26\n\n   For (H, E) or (7, 4):\n   Encrypted pair = [3, 5; 2, 7] * [7; 4] mod 26\n                  = [3*7 + 5*4; 2*7 + 7*4] mod 26\n                  = [21 + 20; 14 + 28] mod 26\n                  = [41; 42] mod 26\n                  = [15; 16]\n   The encrypted pair is (15, 16) or (P, Q).\n\n   For (L, L) or (11, 11):\n   Encrypted pair = [3, 5; 2, 7] * [11; 11] mod 26\n                  = [3*11 + 5*11; 2*11 + 7*11] mod 26\n                  = [33 + 55; 22 + 77] mod 26\n                  = [88; 99] mod 26\n                  = [10; 23]\n   The encrypted pair is (10, 23) or (K, X).\n\n   For (O, _) or (14, _):\n   Since we don't have a second letter to pair with \"O\", we don't need to encrypt it.\n\n4. Convert the encrypted numerical values back to letters.\n   (15, 16) -> PQ\n   (10, 23) -> KX\n\n5. Combine the encrypted pairs to get the final encrypted message.\n   Encrypted message: \"PQKX\"\n\nSo, the encrypted message for \"HELLO\" using the given Hill Cipher key matrix is \"PQKX\"."
