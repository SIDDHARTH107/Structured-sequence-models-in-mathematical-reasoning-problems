    "message_2": "To find the radius of the circular garden with a maximum area of 500 square meters, we can use the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nArea = π * r^2\n\nwhere Area is the area of the circle, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nWe are given the maximum area as 500 square meters, so we can set up the equation:\n\n500 = π * r^2\n\nNow, we need to solve for r:\n\nr^2 = 500 / π\nr^2 ≈ 500 / 3.14159\nr^2 ≈ 159.15494\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the radius:\n\nr ≈ √159.15494\nr ≈ 12.62 meters\n\nSo, the radius of the circular garden that will give the maximum area of 500 square meters is approximately 12.62 meters."
