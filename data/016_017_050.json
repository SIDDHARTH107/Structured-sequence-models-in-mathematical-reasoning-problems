    "message_1": "A Heighway dragon curve starts with a line segment of length 1. At each iteration, each line segment is replaced by a pattern of line segments that looks like a right-angled isosceles triangle, such that the total length of the new segments is the same as the length of the segment being replaced.\n\nIf we draw the Heighway dragon curve up to the 10th iteration, what is the total length of the resulting curve?",
    "message_2": "Since the total length of the new segments at each iteration is the same as the length of the segment being replaced, the total length of the curve remains constant throughout the iterations. Therefore, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve up to the 10th iteration is the same as the initial length, which is 1."
