Discuss the consistency of the system and provide a solution if possible.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write down the augmented matrix of the system:\n\n| 1  1  1 | 6\n| 2  2  2 | 12\n| 3  3  3 | 18\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form:\n\n1. Divide the second row by 2 and the third row by 3:\n\n| 1  1  1 | 6\n| 1  1  1 | 6\n| 1  1  1 | 6\n\n2. Subtract the first row from the second and third rows:\n\n| 1  1  1 | 6\n| 0  0  0 | 0\n| 0  0  0 | 0\n\nThe coefficient matrix is singular because it has a row of zeros. Now, let's discuss the consistency of the system.\n\nSince the second and third rows are all zeros, we only have one non-trivial equation left:\n\nx + y + z = 6\n\nThis equation represents a plane in 3D space. The system is consistent because there is no contradiction (e.g., 0 = k, where k is a non-zero constant). However, there is no unique solution, as there are infinitely many points (x, y, z) that lie on this plane and satisfy the equation.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the others. For example, we can write z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = 6 - x - y\n\nNow, the general solution can be written as:\n\n(x, y, 6 - x - y)\n\nwhere x and y can be any real numbers."
