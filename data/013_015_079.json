    "message_1": "Consider a principal and an agent in a one-shot principal-agent game where the principal can either offer a fixed wage or a variable wage based on the agent's effort. If the agent exerts high effort, the principal will offer him a wage of $90. If the agent exerts low effort, the principal will offer him a wage of $30. The agent's effort is either high or low. If the principal offers a fixed wage, the agent's payoff will be equal to the wage offered. If the principal offers a variable wage, the agent's payoff will be equal to the wage offered minus the cost of effort (which is $20 if the agent exerts high effort and $10 if the agent exerts low effort). If the agent's payoff is negative, it is considered a loss. \n\nSuppose that the agent is risk-averse with the following utility function: \nU(x) = sqrt(x), where x is the agent's payoff.\n\nWhat decision should the principal make to maximize the expected payoff of the agent?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the expected payoff of the agent, we need to compare the utility of the agent under both fixed and variable wage scenarios.\n\n1. Fixed wage scenario:\nLet's assume the principal offers a fixed wage W. In this case, the agent's utility will be U(W) = sqrt(W).\n\n2. Variable wage scenario:\nIf the agent exerts high effort, the wage is $90, and the cost of effort is $20. The agent's payoff is $70, and the utility is U(70) = sqrt(70).\nIf the agent exerts low effort, the wage is $30, and the cost of effort is $10. The agent's payoff is $20, and the utility is U(20) = sqrt(20).\n\nNow, let's assume the probability of the agent exerting high effort is p and the probability of exerting low effort is (1-p). The expected utility under the variable wage scenario is:\n\nE(U) = p * U(70) + (1-p) * U(20)\nE(U) = p * sqrt(70) + (1-p) * sqrt(20)\n\nTo decide which wage scenario is better for the agent, we need to compare the utility under the fixed wage scenario (U(W)) with the expected utility under the variable wage scenario (E(U)).\n\nIf U(W) > E(U), the principal should offer a fixed wage.\nIf U(W) < E(U), the principal should offer a variable wage.\n\nSince we don't have a specific value for W or p, we cannot make a definitive decision. However, the principal can use this comparison to decide which wage scenario to offer based on the agent's preferences and the probability of exerting high or low effort."
