    "message_1": "Consider the following second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients:\n\ny''(t) + 2y'(t) + 2y(t) = u(t)\n\nwhere y(t) is the output and u(t) is the control input function. Assume that the initial conditions are y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0. The goal is to design a control input function u(t) that drives the output y(t) to zero as t approaches infinity while minimizing a quadratic cost function of the form:\n\nJ(u) = ∫[0, ∞] (y(t)^2 + r*u(t)^2) dt\n\nwhere r > 0 is a given constant. Find the optimal control input function u(t) that minimizes J(u) subject to the differential equation and initial conditions.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control input function u(t) that minimizes J(u), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new function, the Lagrangian L(t), defined as:\n\nL(t) = y(t)^2 + r*u(t)^2 + λ(t) * (y''(t) + 2y'(t) + 2y(t) - u(t))\n\nwhere λ(t) is the Lagrange multiplier. The necessary conditions for optimality are given by the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n\n∂L/∂y = 0\n∂L/∂y' = 0\n∂L/∂u = 0\n\nDifferentiating L(t) with respect to y, y', and u, we get:\n\n1. 2y(t) + 2λ(t) = 0\n2. 2λ'(t) = 0\n3. 2r*u(t) - λ(t) = 0\n\nFrom equation (2), we have λ'(t) = 0, which implies that λ(t) is a constant. Let's denote this constant as -2k. Then, from equation (1), we have:\n\ny(t) = k\n\nNow, substituting λ(t) = -2k in equation (3), we get:\n\nu(t) = k/r\n\nNow, we need to find the value of k that satisfies the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0. Since y(t) = k, we have:\n\nk = 1\n\nThus, the optimal control input function u(t) that minimizes J(u) is:\n\nu(t) = 1/r"
