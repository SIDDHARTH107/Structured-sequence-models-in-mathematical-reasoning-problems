    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To find the minimum-sized vertex cover, we can use the concept of maximum matching.\n\nIn a graph, a matching is a set of edges that do not share any vertices. A maximum matching is a matching with the maximum number of edges. According to KÃ¶nig's theorem, in a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching.\n\nHowever, we don't know if the given graph G is bipartite or not. So, we need to consider the worst-case scenario.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph G is a complete graph with 7 vertices. In a complete graph, the minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices minus one. This is because we can cover all the edges by selecting all the vertices except one.\n\nTherefore, the minimum-sized vertex cover for the given graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges is 6."
