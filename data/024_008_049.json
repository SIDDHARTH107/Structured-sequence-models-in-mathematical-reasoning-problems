    "message_2": "The given equation represents a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin. Since it is a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 2-dimensional space, the Ricci curvature is equivalent to the Gaussian curvature.\n\nTo compute the Gaussian curvature, we first need to parameterize the manifold. A natural parameterization for a circle is given by polar coordinates:\n\nx(θ) = 2cos(θ)\ny(θ) = 2sin(θ)\n\nNow, we compute the first and second derivatives of x and y with respect to θ:\n\nx'(θ) = -2sin(θ)\ny'(θ) = 2cos(θ)\n\nx''(θ) = -2cos(θ)\ny''(θ) = -2sin(θ)\n\nNext, we compute the metric tensor g_ij and its inverse g^ij. The metric tensor is given by:\n\ng_ij = [[x'(θ)^2 + y'(θ)^2, 0], [0, x'(θ)^2 + y'(θ)^2]]\n\ng_ij = [[4, 0], [0, 4]]\n\nThe inverse metric tensor is:\n\ng^ij = [[1/4, 0], [0, 1/4]]\n\nNow, we compute the Christoffel symbols Γ^k_ij:\n\nΓ^k_ij = 1/2 * g^kl * (∂g_il/∂x^j + ∂g_jl/∂x^i - ∂g_ij/∂x^l)\n\nSince the metric tensor is constant, all its derivatives are zero. Thus, all the Christoffel symbols are also zero.\n\nFinally, we compute the Gaussian curvature K using the Riemann curvature tensor:\n\nK = R^1_212 = ∂Γ^1_12/∂x^2 - ∂Γ^1_22/∂x^1 + Γ^1_12 * Γ^2_22 - Γ^1_22 * Γ^2_12\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols are zero, the Gaussian curvature K is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the Ricci curvature of the given 2-dimensional manifold at the point (1, 1) is 0."
