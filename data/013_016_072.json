    "message_1": "Suppose that John is a salesperson whose salary is determined by the total revenue generated by his sales over the course of a month, denoted by R. John is considering whether or not to exert extra effort in his job. If he puts forth high effort (E = 1), his revenue will be $10,000 with probability 0.8 and $5,000 with probability 0.2. If he puts forth low effort (E = 0), his revenue will be $7,000 with probability 1. Find John's optimal effort level and expected monthly revenue using the concepts of moral hazard.",
    "message_2": "To find John's optimal effort level and expected monthly revenue, we need to calculate the expected revenue for both high effort and low effort scenarios and compare them.\n\nHigh effort (E = 1):\nExpected revenue = (probability of $10,000) * ($10,000) + (probability of $5,000) * ($5,000)\nExpected revenue = (0.8) * ($10,000) + (0.2) * ($5,000)\nExpected revenue = $8,000 + $1,000\nExpected revenue = $9,000\n\nLow effort (E = 0):\nExpected revenue = (probability of $7,000) * ($7,000)\nExpected revenue = (1) * ($7,000)\nExpected revenue = $7,000\n\nComparing the expected revenues, we can see that the expected revenue for high effort ($9,000) is greater than the expected revenue for low effort ($7,000). Therefore, John's optimal effort level is to put forth high effort (E = 1).\n\nJohn's expected monthly revenue when he puts forth high effort is $9,000."
