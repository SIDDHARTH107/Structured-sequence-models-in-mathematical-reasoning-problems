    "message_2": "If it takes 50% longer to solve the problem without a tutor, we first need to find 50% of the time it takes with a tutor. \n\n50% of 10 minutes = (50/100) * 10 = 5 minutes\n\nNow, add this extra time to the original time it takes with a tutor:\n\n10 minutes (with tutor) + 5 minutes (extra time) = 15 minutes\n\nSo, it would take 15 minutes to solve the same problem without a tutor's presence."
