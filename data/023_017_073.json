    "message_1": "A fluid flow model in a channel of width 2 meters is given by the equation $u(x) = 2\\sin(\\frac {\\pi x}{2})$, where $u$ is the velocity of the fluid in meters per second and $x$ is the distance in meters from the center of the channel. What is the fundamental frequency of the fluid flow and what is the wavelength of the flow? Use Fourier analysis to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "The given fluid flow model is already in the form of a Fourier sine series, specifically $u(x) = 2\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{2})$. In general, a Fourier sine series is given by:\n\n$$u(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L})$$\n\nwhere $B_n$ are the Fourier coefficients and $L$ is half the width of the channel. In our case, $L = 1$ meter (since the channel width is 2 meters) and the given equation is already in the form of the first term of the Fourier sine series with $n = 1$ and $B_1 = 2$.\n\nThe fundamental frequency, denoted as $f_1$, is related to the first term of the Fourier series and can be found using the formula:\n\n$$f_1 = \\frac{n_1 c}{2L}$$\n\nwhere $n_1 = 1$ (since we are considering the first term of the series), $c$ is the speed of the wave, and $L$ is half the width of the channel. In our case, the speed of the wave is not given, so we can express the fundamental frequency in terms of $c$:\n\n$$f_1 = \\frac{c}{2}$$\n\nThe wavelength, denoted as $\\lambda_1$, is related to the fundamental frequency and can be found using the formula:\n\n$$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{2L}{n_1}$$\n\nIn our case, $L = 1$ meter and $n_1 = 1$, so the wavelength is:\n\n$$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{2(1)}{1} = 2 \\text{ meters}$$\n\nIn summary, the fundamental frequency of the fluid flow is $f_1 = \\frac{c}{2}$ (in terms of the wave speed $c$), and the wavelength of the flow is $\\lambda_1 = 2$ meters."
