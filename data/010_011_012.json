    "message_2": "To determine the homotopy type of the 4-dimensional manifold M, we need to analyze its fundamental group given by the presentation <a, b, c, d | abcd = 1>.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the relation abcd = 1 as abcd = e, where e is the identity element. We can then rewrite this relation as d = a^(-1)b^(-1)c^(-1). This shows that the fundamental group can be generated by only three generators, say a, b, and c, with the relation d = a^(-1)b^(-1)c^(-1).\n\nNow, let's consider the 3-torus T^3, which is the product of three circles S^1 x S^1 x S^1. The fundamental group of T^3 is given by the presentation <a, b, c | [a, b] = [b, c] = [c, a] = e>, where [x, y] denotes the commutator xyx^(-1)y^(-1).\n\nNotice that in the fundamental group of M, the relation d = a^(-1)b^(-1)c^(-1) can be rewritten as a commutator relation [a, b] = c^(-1). Since there are no other relations among the generators a, b, and c, we can conclude that the fundamental group of M is isomorphic to the fundamental group of T^3.\n\nTherefore, the 4-dimensional manifold M is homotopy equivalent to the 3-torus T^3. However, it is important to note that this does not imply that M is homeomorphic or diffeomorphic to T^3, as it is a 4-dimensional manifold, and T^3 is a 3-dimensional manifold. The homotopy equivalence only implies that M and T^3 have the same fundamental group and share similar topological properties."
