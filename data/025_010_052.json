    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth plane curve of degree 3 defined by the equation f(x,y) = 0, where f(x,y) = y^3 - x^2(x+1). Let L be the line bundle associated to the divisor D = (2,0) - (0,0). \n\nFind the dimension of the space of global sections H^0(X,L) and the degree of L.",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of L, we first need to compute the intersection number of the divisor D with the curve X. The divisor D is given by the difference of two points (2,0) and (0,0). Let's consider the vertical line x = 1, which passes through the midpoint of these two points. This line intersects the curve X at the points where y^3 = x^2(x+1) with x = 1, i.e., y^3 = 2.\n\nThe equation y^3 = 2 has three distinct roots, which are the three points of intersection of the line x = 1 with the curve X. Therefore, the intersection number of the divisor D with the curve X is 3.\n\nNow, the degree of the line bundle L associated to the divisor D is equal to the intersection number of D with X, which is 3.\n\nNext, we need to find the dimension of the space of global sections H^0(X,L). By Riemann-Roch theorem for curves, we have:\n\nh^0(X,L) - h^1(X,L) = deg(L) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere g is the genus of the curve X. Since X is a smooth plane curve of degree 3, its genus is given by the formula:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2 = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 1.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nh^0(X,L) - h^1(X,L) = 3 + 1 - 1 = 3.\n\nSince X is a smooth curve of genus 1, it is an elliptic curve, and it is well-known that h^1(X,L) = 0 for any line bundle L on an elliptic curve. Therefore, we have:\n\nh^0(X,L) = 3.\n\nSo, the dimension of the space of global sections H^0(X,L) is 3, and the degree of L is 3."
