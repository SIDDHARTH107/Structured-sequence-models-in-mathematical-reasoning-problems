Since there are no common elements between A and B, the intersection is an empty set:\n\nA ∩ B = ∅\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) x B. Since A ∩ B is an empty set, the Cartesian product will also be an empty set:\n\n(A ∩ B) x B = ∅ x B = ∅\n\nNext, we need to find the Cartesian product of A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of A x {4}:\n\nA x {4} = {(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)}\n\nFinally, we need to find the intersection of A x B and A x {4}, which is represented by A x B ∩ A x {4}:\n\nA x B ∩ A x {4} = {(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)}\n\nSo, the two sets we were asked to find are:\n\n(A ∩ B) x B = ∅\nA x B ∩ A x {4} = {(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)}"
