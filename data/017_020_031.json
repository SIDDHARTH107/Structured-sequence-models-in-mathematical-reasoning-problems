    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of a group G is 40, which can be factored as 40 = 2^3 * 5. Therefore, we need to find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 5. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be either 1 or 8.\n\nNow, we consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 8 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5. Since both P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 8 * 5 / 1 = 40. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group of order 40, C_40.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 8: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 8, but there are 8 Sylow 5-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, G has a semidirect product structure with P as the normal subgroup. The action of the Sylow 5-subgroup on P determines the group structure. Since P is abelian, there are two possible actions: the trivial action and the non-trivial action. The trivial action gives the direct product C_8 × C_5, which is isomorphic to C_40. The non-trivial action gives a non-abelian group of order 40, which we denote as G_1.\n\n3. n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5, but there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups. Since Q is normal in G, G has a semidirect product structure with Q as the normal subgroup. The action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on Q determines the group structure. Since Q is cyclic, there is only one non-trivial action, which gives a non-abelian group of order 40, which we denote as G_2.\n\n4. n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 8: In this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups and 8 Sylow 5-subgroups. Since neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 5-subgroups are normal in G, there is no semidirect product structure, and no new groups can be formed.\n\nIn summary, there are three non-isomorphic groups of order 40: the cyclic group C_40, and the non-abelian groups G_1 and G_2."
