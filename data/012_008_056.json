    "message_2": "Yes, this graph is planar. A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing each other. The given graph can be redrawn without any edge crossings:\n\n  A-----B\n  |     |\n  C-----D\n  |     |\n  |  X  |\n  |     |\n\nIn this representation, none of the edges cross each other, so the graph is planar."
