    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors required to color the edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color, we can use the concept of edge chromatic number. The edge chromatic number, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of a graph G such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, for any graph G, its edge chromatic number χ'(G) satisfies the inequality:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nwhere Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the graph G.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph. Since there are 15 edges in the graph, the maximum degree cannot be more than 6 (as 7 would require at least 7 * (7 - 1) / 2 = 21 edges). Let's check if it's possible to have a graph with 10 vertices, 15 edges, and maximum degree 6.\n\nConsider a graph with one vertex connected to 6 other vertices. This gives us 6 edges. Now, we can add 3 more vertices, each connected to 2 of the 6 vertices, forming a triangle. This adds 3 * 3 = 9 more edges, for a total of 15 edges. The maximum degree in this graph is 6.\n\nNow that we have found a graph with Δ(G) = 6, we can apply Vizing's theorem:\n\n6 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 7\n\nSince we want the minimum number of colors, we will try to color the edges with 6 colors. We can do this by assigning a different color to each of the 6 edges connected to the central vertex. Then, for each of the 3 triangles, we can color their edges using the 3 colors not used on the adjacent edges connected to the central vertex. This way, no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors required to color the edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color is 6."
