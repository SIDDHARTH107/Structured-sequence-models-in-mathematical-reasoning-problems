The data for 8 students is as follows:\n\n- Student 1: 25 minutes of study, score of 70 \n- Student 2: 30 minutes of study, score of 80 \n- Student 3: 35 minutes of study, score of 85 \n- Student 4: 40 minutes of study, score of 90 \n- Student 5: 45 minutes of study, score of 94 \n- Student 6: 50 minutes of study, score of 95 \n- Student 7: 55 minutes of study, score of 97 \n- Student 8: 60 minutes of study, score of 98\n\nCalculate the correlation coefficient between the amount of study time and test score, and interpret the results in terms of strength and direction of the relationship between the two variables.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between the amount of study time and test score, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere x represents the study time, y represents the test score, x̄ is the mean of study time, and ȳ is the mean of test scores.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean of study time (x̄) and test scores (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 60) / 8 = 340 / 8 = 42.5 minutes\nȳ = (70 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 94 + 95 + 97 + 98) / 8 = 709 / 8 = 88.625 points\n\nNext, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator: Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)]\nDenominator: √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²]\n\nFor each student, we will calculate (x - x̄)(y - ȳ), (x - x̄)², and (y - ȳ)²:\n\nStudent 1: (-17.5)(-18.625) = 326.09375, 306.25, 346.890625\nStudent 2: (-12.5)(-8.625) = 107.8125, 156.25, 74.390625\nStudent 3: (-7.5)(-3.625) = 27.1875, 56.25, 13.140625\nStudent 4: (-2.5)(1.375) = -3.4375, 6.25, 1.890625\nStudent 5: (2.5)(5.375) = 13.4375, 6.25, 28.890625\nStudent 6: (7.5)(6.375) = 47.8125, 56.25, 40.640625\nStudent 7: (12.5)(8.375) = 104.6875, 156.25, 70.140625\nStudent 8: (17.5)(9.375) = 164.0625, 306.25, 87.890625\n\nNow, we will sum up the values for each column:\n\nΣ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] = 326.09375 + 107.8125 + 27.1875 - 3.4375 + 13.4375 + 47.8125 + 104.6875 + 164.0625 = 787.65625\nΣ(x - x̄)² = 306.25 + 156.25 + 56.25 + 6.25 + 6.25 + 56.25 + 156.25 + 306.25 = 1050\nΣ(y - ȳ)² = 346.890625 + 74.390625 + 13.140625 + 1.890625 + 28.890625 + 40.640625 + 70.140625 + 87.890625 = 663.875\n\nNow, we can calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = 787.65625 / √(1050 * 663.875) ≈ 0.966\n\nThe correlation coefficient is approximately 0.966, which indicates a strong positive relationship between the amount of study time and test score. This means that as the amount of study time increases, the test score also tends to increase."
