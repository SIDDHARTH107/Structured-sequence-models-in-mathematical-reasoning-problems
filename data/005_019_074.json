    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a person drinking coffee on any given day is 0.6, and the probability of that person drinking tea on the same day is 0.4. If a person who drinks coffee on any given day is 90% likely to also drink coffee on the following day, while someone who drinks tea on any given day has a 80% chance of drinking tea the following day. What is the probability that a person who drinks coffee on Monday will drink tea on Wednesday?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the following notation:\n\nC1: drinks coffee on Monday\nC2: drinks coffee on Tuesday\nC3: drinks coffee on Wednesday\nT1: drinks tea on Monday\nT2: drinks tea on Tuesday\nT3: drinks tea on Wednesday\n\nWe want to find the probability P(T3 | C1). We can use the law of total probability to break this down:\n\nP(T3 | C1) = P(T3 | C1, C2) * P(C2 | C1) + P(T3 | C1, T2) * P(T2 | C1)\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(C2 | C1) = 0.9 (90% chance of drinking coffee on Tuesday given they drank coffee on Monday)\nP(T2 | C1) = 0.1 (10% chance of drinking tea on Tuesday given they drank coffee on Monday)\nP(C2 | T1) = 0.2 (20% chance of drinking coffee on Tuesday given they drank tea on Monday)\nP(T2 | T1) = 0.8 (80% chance of drinking tea on Tuesday given they drank tea on Monday)\n\nNow, we need to find P(T3 | C1, C2) and P(T3 | C1, T2).\n\nP(T3 | C1, C2) = P(T3 | C2) (since Wednesday's choice only depends on Tuesday's choice)\nP(T3 | C1, T2) = P(T3 | T2) (for the same reason)\n\nWe have:\n\nP(T3 | C2) = 0.4 (40% chance of drinking tea on Wednesday given they drank coffee on Tuesday)\nP(T3 | T2) = 0.8 (80% chance of drinking tea on Wednesday given they drank tea on Tuesday)\n\nNow we can plug these values into our original equation:\n\nP(T3 | C1) = P(T3 | C1, C2) * P(C2 | C1) + P(T3 | C1, T2) * P(T2 | C1)\nP(T3 | C1) = (0.4) * (0.9) + (0.8) * (0.1)\nP(T3 | C1) = 0.36 + 0.08\nP(T3 | C1) = 0.44\n\nSo, the probability that a person who drinks coffee on Monday will drink tea on Wednesday is 0.44 or 44%."
