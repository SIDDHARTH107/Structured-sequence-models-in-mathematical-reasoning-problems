    "message_2": "The problem statement is not clear. If we assume that 75% of the people are part of a married couple, then the probability of selecting a person who is part of a married couple can be calculated.\n\nThere are 500 people in the community, and 75% of them are part of a married couple. So, the number of people who are part of a married couple is:\n\n0.75 * 500 = 375\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that a randomly selected person is part of a married couple. To do this, we divide the number of people who are part of a married couple by the total number of people in the community:\n\nProbability = (Number of people who are part of a married couple) / (Total number of people)\nProbability = 375 / 500\nProbability = 0.75 or 75%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person is part of a married couple is 75%."
