    "message_2": "In a round-robin tournament, each team plays every other team exactly once. For 9 teams, we can use the combination formula to determine the total number of games played:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams (9) and k is the size of the combination (2, since each game consists of 2 teams).\n\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9-2)!)\n= 9! / (2!7!)\n= (9 × 8 × 7!)/(2 × 7!)\n= (9 × 8)/2\n= 36\n\nSo, a total of 36 games are played in the round-robin tournament of 9 teams."
