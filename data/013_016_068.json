    "message_1": "Consider a company that hires individuals to produce widgets. Each worker can either work hard or shirk. If a worker works hard, they produce two widgets and receive a wage of $20. If they shirk, they produce only one widget, but still receive a wage of $20. The probability that a worker will shirk is 1/2. Let's assume that the company incurs no additional costs from shirking. \n\nSuppose that the company can monitor workers at a cost of $15 per employee. If they do not monitor, workers will shirk half the time. Should the company monitor the employees? If so, what is the maximum monitoring cost that the company should incur?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the company should monitor the employees, we need to compare the expected productivity with and without monitoring.\n\nWithout monitoring:\nThe probability that a worker will shirk is 1/2, and the probability that a worker will work hard is also 1/2. So, the expected number of widgets produced by a worker without monitoring is:\n\n(1/2 * 1 widget) + (1/2 * 2 widgets) = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 widgets\n\nWith monitoring:\nIf the company monitors the workers, they will all work hard to avoid being caught shirking. Therefore, each worker will produce 2 widgets.\n\nNow, let's compare the costs and benefits of monitoring.\n\nWithout monitoring:\nThe cost per worker is just the wage, which is $20. The company gets 1.5 widgets per worker, so the cost per widget is:\n\n$20 / 1.5 widgets = $13.33 per widget\n\nWith monitoring:\nThe cost per worker is the wage plus the monitoring cost, which is $20 + $15 = $35. The company gets 2 widgets per worker, so the cost per widget is:\n\n$35 / 2 widgets = $17.50 per widget\n\nSince the cost per widget is higher with monitoring ($17.50) than without monitoring ($13.33), the company should not monitor the employees at a cost of $15 per employee.\n\nTo find the maximum monitoring cost that the company should incur, we need to find the monitoring cost that makes the cost per widget equal in both cases. Let x be the maximum monitoring cost:\n\n($20 + x) / 2 widgets = $13.33 per widget\n\nSolving for x:\n\n20 + x = 2 * $13.33\nx = 2 * $13.33 - $20\nx = $26.66 - $20\nx = $6.66\n\nTherefore, the maximum monitoring cost that the company should incur is $6.66 per employee."
