    "message_2": "Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm that can be used to find the global minimum of a function. Here, we will use it to find the minimum value of f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 within the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 4.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Initial temperature T = 100 (arbitrary value, can be adjusted)\n   - Cooling rate alpha = 0.99 (arbitrary value, can be adjusted)\n   - Number of iterations per temperature step = 100 (arbitrary value, can be adjusted)\n   - Stopping temperature = 0.001 (arbitrary value, can be adjusted)\n\n2. Start with a random initial solution x within the range [0, 4].\n\n3. Repeat until the stopping temperature is reached:\n   a. For each iteration at the current temperature:\n      i. Generate a random neighbor solution x' within the range [0, 4].\n      ii. Calculate the change in the objective function: Δf = f(x') - f(x).\n      iii. If Δf < 0 (i.e., the new solution is better), accept the new solution: x = x'.\n      iv. If Δf ≥ 0 (i.e., the new solution is worse), accept the new solution with probability exp(-Δf / T): x = x' with probability exp(-Δf / T), otherwise keep the current solution.\n   b. Update the temperature: T = alpha * T.\n\n4. The final solution x is an approximation of the global minimum.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 - 5*x + 6\n\ndef simulated_annealing():\n    T = 100\n    alpha = 0.99\n    iterations = 100\n    stopping_temperature = 0.001\n\n    x = random.uniform(0, 4)\n\n    while T > stopping_temperature:\n        for _ in range(iterations):\n            x_prime = random.uniform(0, 4)\n            delta_f = f(x_prime) - f(x)\n\n            if delta_f < 0:\n                x = x_prime\n            elif random.random() < math.exp(-delta_f / T):\n                x = x_prime\n\n        T *= alpha\n\n    return x, f(x)\n\nx_min, f_min = simulated_annealing()\nprint(f\"Minimum value of f(x): {f_min}\")\nprint(f\"Corresponding value of x: {x_min}\")\n```\n\nPlease note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. You can run the algorithm multiple times and take the average to get a more accurate result."
