    "message_1": "A circular garden has a radius of 14 meters. Find the perimeter of one-third of the garden (i.e., a sector of the circle) if the central angle of the sector is 120 degrees. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to find the length of the arc and the two radii that form the sector.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * π * radius\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 120 degrees, and the radius is 14 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (120 / 360) * 2 * π * 14\n\nArc length = (1/3) * 2 * π * 14\n\nArc length = (2/3) * π * 14 ≈ 29.32 meters (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector. Since the radius is 14 meters, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * radius\n\nPerimeter = 29.32 + 2 * 14\n\nPerimeter = 29.32 + 28\n\nPerimeter ≈ 57.32 meters (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the perimeter of one-third of the garden (the sector) is approximately 57.32 meters."
