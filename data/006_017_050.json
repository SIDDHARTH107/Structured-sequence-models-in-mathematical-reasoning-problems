    "message_1": "Suppose that in a certain city the probability of a car accident occurring on a particular road during a given month is 0.15. What is the probability that there will be at least two car accidents on that road in the next six months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. However, it's easier to find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., the probability that there will be fewer than two car accidents in the next six months) and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nLet X be the number of car accidents in the next six months. We want to find P(X ≥ 2). The complementary event is X < 2, which means either 0 or 1 car accident occurs in the next six months.\n\nThe probability of 0 car accidents is given by the binomial formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(6, 0) * (0.15)^0 * (1 - 0.15)^6\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.85)^6\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.377149\n\nThe probability of 1 car accident is given by the binomial formula:\n\nP(X = 1) = C(6, 1) * (0.15)^1 * (1 - 0.15)^5\nP(X = 1) = 6 * 0.15 * (0.85)^5\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.395208\n\nNow, we find the probability of the complementary event:\n\nP(X < 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) ≈ 0.377149 + 0.395208 ≈ 0.772357\n\nFinally, we find the probability of at least two car accidents:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) ≈ 1 - 0.772357 ≈ 0.227643\n\nSo, the probability that there will be at least two car accidents on that road in the next six months is approximately 0.227643 or 22.76%."
