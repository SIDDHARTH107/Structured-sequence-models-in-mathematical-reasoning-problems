    "message_1": "A triangle has angles of 40° and 85° and a side opposite the 40° angle that measures 8 units. Using the law of sines, find the length of the side opposite the 85° angle.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the side opposite the 85° angle as x. We can use the Law of Sines to find the length of this side. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\n(sin 40°) / 8 = (sin 85°) / x\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\nx = (sin 85°) / (sin 40°) * 8\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values:\n\nx ≈ (0.9962) / (0.6428) * 8\n\nx ≈ 12.42\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 85° angle is approximately 12.42 units."
