    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products, A and B. Each unit of A requires 4 hours of labor and 1 hour of processing, and generates a profit of $20. Each unit of B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of processing, and generates a profit of $15. The company has 200 labor hours and 90 processing hours available each week. How many units of A and B should the company produce each week in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and processing hours are as follows:\n\nLabor: 4x + y ≤ 200\nProcessing: x + 3y ≤ 90\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 20x + 15y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. For the labor constraint:\ny ≤ -4x + 200\n\n2. For the processing constraint:\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 30\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of labor and processing constraints:\n4x + y = 200\nx + 3y = 90\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 30 and y = 20.\n\nThe other vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraint lines intersect the x and y axes:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint with x-axis (y = 0):\n4x + 0 = 200\nx = 50\n\n2. Intersection of labor constraint with y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + y = 200\ny = 200\n\n3. Intersection of processing constraint with x-axis (y = 0):\nx + 3(0) = 90\nx = 90\n\n4. Intersection of processing constraint with y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + 3y = 90\ny = 30\n\nNow we have the vertices of the feasible region: (30, 20), (50, 0), (0, 200), and (0, 30). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (30, 20): 20(30) + 15(20) = 600 + 300 = $900\n2. Profit at (50, 0): 20(50) + 15(0) = 1000 + 0 = $1000\n3. Profit at (0, 200): 20(0) + 15(200) = 0 + 3000 = $3000 (This point is not in the feasible region since it doesn't satisfy the processing constraint)\n4. Profit at (0, 30): 20(0) + 15(30) = 0 + 450 = $450\n\nThe maximum profit is $1000, which occurs when the company produces 50 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
