    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, Product A and Product B. The cost of producing one unit of Product A is $10, and the cost of producing one unit of Product B is $15. The company only has a budget of $5000 for production. Product A sells for $25 per unit, and Product B sells for $30 per unit. What is the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe cost of producing x units of Product A and y units of Product B is given by the equation:\n\n10x + 15y ≤ 5000 (Budget constraint)\n\nThe profit from selling x units of Product A and y units of Product B is given by the equation:\n\nProfit = 25x + 30y - 10x - 15y = 15x + 15y\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the budget constraint.\n\nFirst, let's express y in terms of x using the budget constraint:\n\n15y ≤ 5000 - 10x\ny ≤ (5000 - 10x) / 15\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit = 15x + 15y\n\nSince both x and y are non-negative integers (you can't produce a negative number of units), we can use integer programming or simply test different values of x and y to find the optimal solution.\n\nBy testing different values of x and y, we find that the optimal solution is:\n\nx = 250 (units of Product A)\ny = 100 (units of Product B)\n\nThis gives us a maximum profit of:\n\nProfit = 15(250) + 15(100) = 3750 + 1500 = $5250\n\nSo, the company should produce 250 units of Product A and 100 units of Product B to maximize its profit."
