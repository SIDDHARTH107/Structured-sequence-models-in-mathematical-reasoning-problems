    "message_1": "A mass of 2kg on a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m is set into oscillation with an amplitude of 0.1m. What is the natural frequency of the oscillation in vibrations per second, and what is the period of oscillation in seconds?",
    "message_2": "To find the natural frequency of the oscillation, we can use the formula:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(k / m)\n\nwhere f is the natural frequency, k is the spring constant, and m is the mass.\n\nGiven k = 50 N/m and m = 2 kg, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(50 / 2)\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(25)\nf = (1 / 2π) * 5\nf ≈ 0.7958 vibrations per second\n\nThe natural frequency of the oscillation is approximately 0.7958 vibrations per second.\n\nTo find the period of oscillation, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 1 / f\n\nwhere T is the period and f is the natural frequency.\n\nT = 1 / 0.7958\nT ≈ 1.2564 seconds\n\nThe period of oscillation is approximately 1.2564 seconds."
