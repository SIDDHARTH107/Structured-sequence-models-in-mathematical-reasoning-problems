    "message_2": "To calculate the required sample size, we will use the formula for the margin of error (E) in estimating a population mean:\n\nE = Z * (σ / √n)\n\nWhere:\nE = Margin of error\nZ = Z-score (critical value) corresponding to the desired confidence level\nσ = Population standard deviation\nn = Sample size\n\nWe are given:\nE = 3\nσ = 10\nConfidence level = 95%\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score corresponding to a 95% confidence level. For a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is 1.96 (you can find this value in a standard Z-score table or using a calculator).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula and solve for n:\n\n3 = 1.96 * (10 / √n)\n\nTo solve for n, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by 1.96:\n3 / 1.96 = (10 / √n)\n1.53 ≈ (10 / √n)\n\n2. Square both sides of the equation:\n(1.53)^2 = (10 / √n)^2\n2.34 ≈ 100 / n\n\n3. Multiply both sides of the equation by n:\n2.34n ≈ 100\n\n4. Divide both sides of the equation by 2.34:\nn ≈ 100 / 2.34\nn ≈ 42.74\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a sample, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the desired margin of error is achieved:\n\nn ≈ 43\n\nSo, the required sample size is approximately 43."
