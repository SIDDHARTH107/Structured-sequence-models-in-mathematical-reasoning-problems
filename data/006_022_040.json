    "message_1": "In a school, there are 120 students studying Mathematics. Out of these, 60 students are boys and the rest are girls. If the probability of a boy passing the Mathematics exam is 0.75 and the probability of a girl passing the exam is 0.65, what is the probability that a randomly chosen student from the mathematics department will pass the exam?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen student will pass the exam, we can use the law of total probability. We will first find the probability of choosing a boy or a girl, and then multiply it by the probability of passing the exam for each gender.\n\nThere are 60 boys and 120 students in total, so the probability of choosing a boy is 60/120 = 1/2. The probability of choosing a girl is also 1/2 since there are equal numbers of boys and girls.\n\nNow, we multiply the probability of choosing a boy or a girl by the probability of passing the exam for each gender:\n\nProbability (Boy) * Probability (Boy passes) + Probability (Girl) * Probability (Girl passes)\n\n= (1/2) * 0.75 + (1/2) * 0.65\n\n= 0.375 + 0.325\n\n= 0.7\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen student from the mathematics department will pass the exam is 0.7 or 70%."
