Show that $$\\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i b_i(M) \\leq k$$ where $b_i(M)$ is the $i$-th Betti number of $M$. If $M$ is a closed orientable surface, what is the maximum value of $k$ for which there exists a Morse function with $k$ critical points?",
    "message_2": "We will use Morse inequalities to prove the statement. Recall that the Morse inequalities state that for a Morse function $f: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with $c_i$ critical points of index $i$, we have\n$$c_i \\geq b_i(M)$$\nfor each $i = 0, 1, 2, 3$, and\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i c_i \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i b_i(M).$$\n\nSince $k$ is the total number of critical points, we have $k = \\sum_{i=0}^3 c_i$. Therefore,\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i k = \\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i \\sum_{j=0}^3 c_j = \\sum_{i=0}^3 \\sum_{j=0}^3 (-1)^i c_j = \\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i c_i \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i b_i(M).$$\n\nThis proves the inequality $\\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i b_i(M) \\leq k$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $M$ is a closed orientable surface. We know that the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface of genus $g$ is given by $\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g$. Moreover, we have $\\chi(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^2 (-1)^i b_i(M)$. Since $M$ is a surface, $b_2(M) = 0$, and we have $b_0(M) = 1$ and $b_1(M) = 2g$. Thus, $\\chi(M) = 1 - 2g$.\n\nUsing the Morse inequalities, we have\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^2 (-1)^i b_i(M) \\leq k \\Rightarrow 1 - 2g \\leq k.$$\n\nThe maximum value of $k$ occurs when the genus $g$ is minimized, which is $g = 0$ for the sphere $S^2$. In this case, we have\n$$1 - 2(0) \\leq k \\Rightarrow k \\geq 1.$$\n\nFor the sphere $S^2$, we can construct a Morse function with exactly $k = 2$ critical points (for example, the height function on the sphere). Therefore, the maximum value of $k$ for which there exists a Morse function with $k$ critical points on a closed orientable surface is $k = 2$."
