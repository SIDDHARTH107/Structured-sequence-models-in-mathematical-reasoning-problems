    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted by S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to find S(6, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate S(6, 3) as follows:\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find S(5, 3) and S(5, 2).\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\n\nNext, we need to find S(4, 3), S(4, 2), and S(4, 1).\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\nS(4, 1) = 1 (since there's only 1 way to partition a set of 4 elements into 1 subset)\n\nNow, we need to find S(3, 3) and S(3, 2).\n\nS(3, 3) = 1 (since there's only 1 way to partition a set of 3 elements into 3 subsets)\nS(3, 2) = 2 * S(2, 2) + S(2, 1)\n\nFinally, we need to find S(2, 2) and S(2, 1).\n\nS(2, 2) = 1 (since there's only 1 way to partition a set of 2 elements into 2 subsets)\nS(2, 1) = 1 (since there's only 1 way to partition a set of 2 elements into 1 subset)\n\nNow we can substitute the values back into the equations:\n\nS(3, 2) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 2) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\nFinally, we can find S(6, 3):\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 ways to partition a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
