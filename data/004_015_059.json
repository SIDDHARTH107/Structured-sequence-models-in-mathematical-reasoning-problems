    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 - 15x + 40, we need to find the second derivative of the function and then find the points where the second derivative changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 - 15x + 40)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x - 15\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x - 15)\n\nUsing the power rule again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the points where the second derivative changes its sign. To do this, we set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n\n6x = 12\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is a potential inflection point at x = 2. To confirm that this is an inflection point, we need to check the sign of the second derivative on either side of x = 2.\n\nLet's check the sign of f''(x) for x = 1 (left of 2) and x = 3 (right of 2):\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6 (negative)\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6 (positive)\n\nSince the second derivative changes its sign from negative to positive at x = 2, there is an inflection point at x = 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding y-coordinate for the inflection point. We can do this by plugging x = 2 back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 - 15(2) + 40\nf(2) = 8 - 24 - 30 + 40\nf(2) = -16 + 10\n\nf(2) = -6\n\nSo, the inflection point is at (2, -6)."
