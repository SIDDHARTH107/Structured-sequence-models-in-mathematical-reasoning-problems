    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, we first need to find the equation of the sphere. The equation of a sphere with radius r and centered at the origin is given by:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2\n\nIn our case, r = 5, so the equation of the sphere is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nNow, we need to find the geodesic curve that passes through the points (1, 2, 2) and (-3, 4, 1). Geodesics on the surface of a sphere are given by great circles, which are the intersections of the sphere with planes that pass through the origin.\n\nLet's find the equation of the plane that passes through the origin and the given points. The normal vector to the plane can be found using the cross product of the position vectors of the points:\n\nA = (1, 2, 2)\nB = (-3, 4, 1)\n\nN = A x B = (8 - 2, -2 - 6, 4 + 6) = (6, -8, 10)\n\nThe equation of the plane can be written as:\n\n6x - 8y + 10z = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this plane with the sphere. Substituting the equation of the sphere into the equation of the plane, we get:\n\n6x - 8y + 10z = 0\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nSolving for x, y, and z, we get:\n\nx = (4y - 5z) / 3\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into the equation of the sphere, we get:\n\n((4y - 5z) / 3)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\n16y^2 - 40yz + 25z^2 = 225\n\nDividing by 225, we get:\n\n(16/225)y^2 - (40/225)yz + (25/225)z^2 = 1\n\nThis is the equation of an ellipse, which represents the intersection of the plane and the sphere. The geodesic curve on the surface of the sphere that passes through the points (1, 2, 2) and (-3, 4, 1) is given by this ellipse."
