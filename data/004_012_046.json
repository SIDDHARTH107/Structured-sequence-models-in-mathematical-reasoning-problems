    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) using the quotient rule, we need to apply the formula:\n\nf'(x) = (g(x) * h'(x) - g'(x) * h(x)) / (h(x))^2\n\nwhere f(x) = g(x) / h(x). In this case, g(x) = 3x^2 + 2x and h(x) = 5x^2 - 7x + 2.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d(3x^2 + 2x)/dx = 6x + 2\nh'(x) = d(5x^2 - 7x + 2)/dx = 10x - 7\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule formula:\n\nf'(x) = ((3x^2 + 2x) * (10x - 7) - (6x + 2) * (5x^2 - 7x + 2)) / (5x^2 - 7x + 2)^2\n\nTo find the derivative of f(x) at x = 1, we substitute x = 1 into the expression for f'(x):\n\nf'(1) = ((3(1)^2 + 2(1)) * (10(1) - 7) - (6(1) + 2) * (5(1)^2 - 7(1) + 2)) / (5(1)^2 - 7(1) + 2)^2\n\nf'(1) = ((3 + 2) * (10 - 7) - (6 + 2) * (5 - 7 + 2)) / (5 - 7 + 2)^2\n\nf'(1) = (5 * 3 - 8 * 0) / 0^2\n\nf'(1) = 15 / 1\n\nf'(1) = 15\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) at x = 1 is 15."
