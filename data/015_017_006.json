    "message_2": "To compute the Lyapunov exponent for the Ikeda map, we need to calculate the average growth rate of the distance between two nearby points in the phase space after many iterations. The Lyapunov exponent is given by the formula:\n\nλ = lim (n -> ∞) (1/n) * Σ(log(||Df(x_n)||))\n\nwhere Df(x_n) is the Jacobian matrix of the map at the point x_n, and ||Df(x_n)|| is the norm of the Jacobian matrix.\n\nFirst, let's find the Jacobian matrix of the Ikeda map:\n\nDf(x_n, y_n) = | ∂x_n+1/∂x_n  ∂x_n+1/∂y_n |\n                       | ∂y_n+1/∂x_n  ∂y_n+1/∂y_n |\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂x_n+1/∂x_n = b * cos(t_n) - b * x_n * (-2 * x_n) * sin(t_n) * (-6) / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2)^2\n∂x_n+1/∂y_n = b * (-sin(t_n)) - b * y_n * (-2 * y_n) * sin(t_n) * (-6) / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2)^2\n∂y_n+1/∂x_n = a * sin(t_n) + a * x_n * (-2 * x_n) * cos(t_n) * (-6) / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2)^2\n∂y_n+1/∂y_n = a * cos(t_n) - a * y_n * (-2 * y_n) * cos(t_n) * (-6) / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2)^2\n\nNow, we have the Jacobian matrix:\n\nDf(x_n, y_n) = | ∂x_n+1/∂x_n  ∂x_n+1/∂y_n |\n                       | ∂y_n+1/∂x_n  ∂y_n+1/∂y_n |\n\nTo compute the Lyapunov exponent, we need to iterate the Ikeda map for a large number of steps, calculate the Jacobian matrix at each step, compute the norm of the Jacobian matrix, and then take the average of the logarithm of the norms.\n\nHowever, this process is computationally intensive and cannot be done analytically. Instead, it requires numerical methods and programming to compute the Lyapunov exponent for the given parameters and initial conditions."
