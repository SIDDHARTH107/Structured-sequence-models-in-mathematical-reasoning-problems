    "message_2": "To find a matrix P such that P^-1AP is diagonal, we need to find the eigenvectors of matrix A and use them as columns of matrix P. \n\nMatrix A:\n[5 1]\n[2 4]\n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvalues of A. To do this, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI:\n[5-λ  1 ]\n[ 2  4-λ]\n\nNow, let's find the determinant:\n\n(5-λ)(4-λ) - (1)(2) = λ^2 - 9λ + 18\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 9λ + 18 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nλ = (9 ± √(9^2 - 4*18)) / 2\nλ = (9 ± √33) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (9 + √33) / 2 and λ2 = (9 - √33) / 2.\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n[5 - (9 + √33) / 2   1] [x1]   [0]\n[       2        4 - (9 + √33) / 2] [x2] = [0]\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\nv1 = [1, (3 - √33) / 2]\n\nFor λ2:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n[5 - (9 - √33) / 2   1] [x1]   [0]\n[       2        4 - (9 - √33) / 2] [x2] = [0]\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\nv2 = [1, (3 + √33) / 2]\n\nNow, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [1  1]\n      [(3 - √33) / 2  (3 + √33) / 2]\n\nSo, the matrix P such that P^-1AP is diagonal is:\n\nP = [1  1]\n      [(3 - √33) / 2  (3 + √33) / 2]"
