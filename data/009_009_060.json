    "message_2": "For a particle in a one-dimensional box, the wave function and energy can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\nWave function: ψ(x) = √(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\nEnergy: E = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)\n\nwhere:\n- L is the length of the box\n- n is the energy level (n = 1 for the ground state)\n- m is the mass of the particle\n- h is the Planck's constant (h = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\n\nLet's calculate the wave function for the ground state (n = 1):\n\nψ(x) = √(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\nψ(x) = √(2/2) * sin(1πx/2)\nψ(x) = √(1) * sin(πx/2)\nψ(x) = sin(πx/2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the energy for the ground state (n = 1):\n\nE = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)\nE = (1^2 * (6.626 x 10^-34)^2) / (8 * 0.5 * (2)^2)\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34)^2 / (8 * 0.5 * 4)\nE = 4.387 x 10^-68 / 16\nE ≈ 2.742 x 10^-67 J\n\nSo, for a particle in a one-dimensional box with a mass of 0.5 kg and a length of 2 meters in the ground state, the wave function is ψ(x) = sin(πx/2) and the energy is approximately 2.742 x 10^-67 J."
