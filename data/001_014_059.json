    "message_2": "To simplify the given radical expression √(243x^6), we need to find the prime factors of the number 243 and the even powers of x.\n\n1. Prime factorization of 243:\n243 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 (3 raised to the power of 5)\n\n2. Even powers of x:\nx^6 = (x^2)^3 (x raised to the power of 2, three times)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the radical expression as:\n\n√(243x^6) = √(3^5 * (x^2)^3)\n\nSince the square root of a number raised to an even power is the number raised to half of that power, we can simplify the expression further:\n\n√(3^5 * (x^2)^3) = 3^(5/2) * x^(2*3/2) = 3^(5/2) * x^3\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n3^(5/2)x^3"
