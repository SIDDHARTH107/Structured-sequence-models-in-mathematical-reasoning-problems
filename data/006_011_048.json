    "message_1": "In a factory, there are 500 workers and the probability of an accident occurring is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 25 accidents will occur in a month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k accidents occurring\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the number of workers (500)\n- k is the number of accidents (we want at least 25)\n- p is the probability of an accident occurring (0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of an accident not occurring (0.95)\n\nSince we want the probability of at least 25 accidents occurring, we need to find the probability of 25 accidents, 26 accidents, 27 accidents, and so on, up to 500 accidents. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 24))\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 24, and then subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1 to find the probability of at least 25 accidents occurring.\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X < 25) ≈ 0.891\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least 25 accidents occurring is:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - 0.891 ≈ 0.109\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 accidents will occur in a month is approximately 10.9%."
