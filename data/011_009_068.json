    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to partition a set of 7 distinct elements into smaller subsets, we use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) counts the number of different ways to partition a set with n elements.\n\nFor n = 7, the Bell number B(7) is 877.\n\nSo, there are 877 different ways to partition a set of 7 distinct elements into smaller subsets."
