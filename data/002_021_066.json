    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector of the pizza that you ate, we first need to find the area of the entire pizza and then take one-fourth of that area.\n\nThe area of a circle can be found using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the pizza is 14 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 7 inches.\n\nA = π(7^2)\nA = π(49)\nA ≈ 153.94 square inches (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we need to find one-fourth of the area:\n\nArea of sector = (1/4) * 153.94 ≈ 38.49 square inches (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the area of the sector of the pizza that you ate is approximately 38.49 square inches."
