    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that the integral of an analytic function over a simple closed contour is zero. In order to apply Cauchy's theorem, we need to check if the function f(z) = z^2 + 3z + 5 is analytic.\n\nA function is analytic if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function f(z) is a polynomial, and polynomials are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic.\n\nNow, since f(z) is analytic and C is a simple closed contour, we can apply Cauchy's theorem:\n\nâˆ®[C] f(z) dz = 0"
