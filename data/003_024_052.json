    "message_2": "To find the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side (the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall) to the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder).\n\nLet's denote the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall as x. We are given the angle (60 degrees) and the length of the ladder (25 meters). Using the cosine function, we can set up the following equation:\n\ncos(60) = x / 25\n\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is equal to 1/2, so we have:\n\n1/2 = x / 25\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 25 * (1/2)\nx = 12.5\n\nSo, the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall is 12.5 meters."
