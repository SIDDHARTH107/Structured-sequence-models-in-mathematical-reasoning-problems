    "message_2": "If the clock gains 15 minutes every hour, it means that for every real hour that passes, the clock will show 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nAfter 5 real hours, the clock will have gained 5 * 15 = 75 minutes, which is equivalent to 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nSo, the clock will show 5 hours (real time) + 1 hour and 15 minutes (gained time) = 6 hours and 15 minutes ahead of the time it was set.\n\nThe clock was set at 4:20 PM. Adding 6 hours and 15 minutes to this time:\n\n4:20 PM + 6 hours = 10:20 PM\n10:20 PM + 15 minutes = 10:35 PM\n\nThe clock will show 10:35 PM after 5 real hours have passed."
