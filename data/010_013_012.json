    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic of the vector bundle E over the 2-dimensional sphere X, we can use the Chern classes of E. In this case, we are given the first Chern class c1(E) = 3r.\n\nRecall that the Euler characteristic χ(E) of a rank 2 vector bundle E over a 2-dimensional sphere X can be computed using the Chern classes as follows:\n\nχ(E) = ∫_X c2(E),\n\nwhere c2(E) is the second Chern class of E.\n\nNow, we need to express c2(E) in terms of the given first Chern class c1(E). For a rank 2 vector bundle E over a 2-dimensional sphere X, we have the following relationship between the Chern classes:\n\nc2(E) = (1/2) * (c1(E))^2.\n\nPlugging in the given value of c1(E) = 3r, we get:\n\nc2(E) = (1/2) * (3r)^2 = (1/2) * 9r^2 = (9/2) * r^2.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic χ(E) as:\n\nχ(E) = ∫_X c2(E) = ∫_X (9/2) * r^2.\n\nSince X is a 2-dimensional sphere with radius r, its area is given by A(X) = 4πr^2. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nχ(E) = (9/2) * r^2 * ∫_X (1/A(X)) * A(X) = (9/2) * r^2 * ∫_X 1.\n\nThe integral of 1 over X is simply the area A(X) = 4πr^2:\n\nχ(E) = (9/2) * r^2 * 4πr^2 = 18πr^4.\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the vector bundle E over the 2-dimensional sphere X is χ(E) = 18πr^4."
