    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to non-monotonic logic:\n\nSuppose that John believes that if it's raining, then he will stay inside. However, if it's not raining, there's a 30% chance that he will stay inside anyway. If John is currently inside his house, what can we conclude about the weather outside?\n\nHint: \"Non-monotonic\" means that new information can sometimes make us change our beliefs, even if it doesn't contradict our existing beliefs.",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we are given the following information:\n\n1. If it's raining, John will stay inside.\n2. If it's not raining, there's a 30% chance that John will stay inside.\n\nWe are also given that John is currently inside his house. However, we cannot definitively conclude whether it is raining or not based on this information alone. \n\nThe fact that John is inside his house could be due to either of the two scenarios mentioned above: it's raining, or it's not raining but he decided to stay inside anyway. \n\nIn non-monotonic logic, we can't make a definite conclusion about the weather outside based on the given information. We would need additional information to make a more informed conclusion."
