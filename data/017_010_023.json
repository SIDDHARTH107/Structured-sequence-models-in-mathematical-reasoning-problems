    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct groups of order 10, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we have two Sylow subgroups: a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 2 and a Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide the order of the group (10) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 5. However, if n_2 = 5, then there would be 5 * (2 - 1) = 5 distinct elements of order 2 in G, leaving only one element of order 5, which contradicts the existence of a Sylow 5-subgroup. Therefore, n_2 = 1, and P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide the order of the group (10) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1, so Q is also a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow we have two cases to consider:\n\n1. G is abelian: In this case, G is the direct product of P and Q, so G is isomorphic to C2 x C5, which is isomorphic to C10.\n\n2. G is non-abelian: Since P and Q are both normal subgroups of G, we can form the semidirect product of P and Q. Let φ: P → Aut(Q) be a nontrivial homomorphism. Since P has order 2, it is isomorphic to C2, and since Q has order 5, it is isomorphic to C5. The automorphism group of C5, Aut(C5), is isomorphic to C4. The only nontrivial homomorphism φ: C2 → C4 maps the generator of C2 to an element of order 2 in C4. This gives us a non-abelian group of order 10, which we will denote as G'.\n\nNow we will show that any non-abelian group of order 10 is isomorphic to G'. Let G be a non-abelian group of order 10 with normal Sylow subgroups P and Q. Since P and Q are both cyclic, we can choose generators p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. The group G is generated by p and q, and since G is non-abelian, we must have pq ≠ qp. Let r = pq. Then r has order 10, since (pq)^10 = p^10q^10 = 1 (because P and Q are normal in G). Thus, G is generated by p and r, with relations p^2 = r^10 = 1 and pr = rp^3 (since pq = rp^3). This presentation is isomorphic to the presentation of G', so G is isomorphic to G'.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three distinct groups of order 10: the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5 (which is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C2 and C5 with the trivial homomorphism), and the non-abelian group G' (which is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C2 and C5 with the nontrivial homomorphism)."
