    "message_1": "A certain company has five technological systems, and the probability of a certain type of failure occurring in any of the systems is 0.05. What is the probability that at least two of the five systems will experience this type of technological failure?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least two systems experiencing a failure, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of the opposite event occurring. In this case, the opposite event is that either none or only one of the systems experience a failure. \n\nLet's calculate the probability of none and only one system experiencing a failure:\n\n1. Probability of no system experiencing a failure:\nSince the probability of a failure is 0.05, the probability of not experiencing a failure is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. For all five systems to not experience a failure, we have:\nP(None) = 0.95^5 ≈ 0.7737809375\n\n2. Probability of exactly one system experiencing a failure:\nWe can use the binomial probability formula for this:\nP(One) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\nwhere n = number of trials (5 systems), k = number of successes (1 failure), p = probability of success (0.05), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(5, 1) = 5 (5 ways to choose 1 system out of 5)\nP(One) = 5 * 0.05^1 * 0.95^4 ≈ 0.206478750000\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability of at least two systems experiencing a failure:\nP(At least 2) = 1 - P(None) - P(One) ≈ 1 - 0.7737809375 - 0.206478750000 ≈ 0.0197403125\n\nSo, the probability that at least two of the five systems will experience this type of technological failure is approximately 0.01974 or 1.974%."
