    "message_1": "Let's say there are two sets: Set A contains 3 distinct elements and Set B contains 6 distinct elements. How many distinct functions of type A → B are there?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct functions from Set A to Set B, we need to determine the number of ways each element in Set A can be mapped to an element in Set B.\n\nSince Set A has 3 distinct elements and Set B has 6 distinct elements, each element in Set A has 6 choices for mapping to an element in Set B.\n\nSo, the number of distinct functions of type A → B can be calculated as:\n\n6 (choices for the first element in A) * 6 (choices for the second element in A) * 6 (choices for the third element in A) = 6^3 = 216\n\nThere are 216 distinct functions of type A → B."
