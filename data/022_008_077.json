    "message_2": "An entire function is a function that is holomorphic (complex differentiable) on the entire complex plane. We are given that $|f(z)| \\leq |\\sin z|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the zeros of the sine function. The sine function has zeros at $z = k\\pi$ for all integers $k$. Since $|f(z)| \\leq |\\sin z|$, we know that $f(z)$ must also have zeros at these points. \n\nNow, we will use Liouville's theorem, which states that every bounded entire function must be constant. We will show that $f(z)$ is bounded on the imaginary axis, and then use the periodicity of the sine function to extend this result to the entire complex plane.\n\nLet $z = iy$ with $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then, we have:\n\n$|f(iy)| \\leq |\\sin(iy)| = |\\frac{e^{y} - e^{-y}}{2i}| = \\frac{1}{2}|e^{y} - e^{-y}| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}(e^{|y|} + e^{-|y|})$\n\nSince the right-hand side is bounded for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we conclude that $f(z)$ is bounded on the imaginary axis.\n\nNow, let's consider the strip $S = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\text{Im}(z)| \\leq \\pi\\}$. Since $f(z)$ is bounded on the imaginary axis and $|\\sin z|$ is periodic with period $2\\pi$ along the imaginary axis, we can conclude that $f(z)$ is bounded on the entire strip $S$.\n\nFinally, we can extend this result to the entire complex plane by noting that $f(z)$ is periodic with period $2\\pi i$. Since $f(z)$ is bounded on the strip $S$, it must also be bounded on the translated strips $S + 2k\\pi i$ for all integers $k$. These strips cover the entire complex plane, so $f(z)$ is bounded everywhere.\n\nBy Liouville's theorem, $f(z)$ must be a constant function. However, we know that $f(z)$ has zeros at $z = k\\pi$ for all integers $k$. The only constant function that satisfies this condition is the zero function, $f(z) = 0$. Therefore, the only entire function that satisfies the given inequality is the zero function."
