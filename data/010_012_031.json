Continuity: Since f is continuous, and the squaring function h: R → R, h(y) = y^2 is also continuous, the composition of continuous functions is continuous. Therefore, g(x) = h(f(x)) is continuous.\n\n2. Non-negativity: For any x in M, g(x) = f(x)^2. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, g(x) >= 0 for all x in M.\n\n3. g(x) = 0 if and only if f(x) = 0: \n\n   (a) If f(x) = 0, then g(x) = f(x)^2 = 0^2 = 0.\n   \n   (b) If g(x) = 0, then f(x)^2 = 0. Since the square of a real number is 0 if and only if the number itself is 0, we have f(x) = 0.\n\nThus, we have shown that there exists a continuous function g: M → R such that g(x) >= 0 for all x in M and g(x) = 0 if and only if f(x) = 0."
