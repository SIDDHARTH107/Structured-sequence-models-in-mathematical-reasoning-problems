    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 72 and 90 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (90) by the smaller number (72) and find the remainder.\n90 รท 72 = 1 with a remainder of 18.\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (72) and the smaller number with the remainder (18) from the previous step.\nNow we need to find the GCD of 72 and 18.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (72) by the smaller number (18) and find the remainder.\n72 รท 18 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the smaller number in this step, which is 18.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 90 is 18."
