    "message_1": "Using temporal logic, determine whether the statement \"It will be raining hard at noon tomorrow\" is true or false, given the following information: Today is Monday, August 2nd, and it is currently 4pm. Assume that \"raining hard\" refers to a specific intensity of rain (as opposed to just any rain) and that \"noon\" is defined as exactly 12pm.",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot predict the weather or determine the truth of a statement about future weather events using temporal logic alone. Temporal logic is a formal system used to reason about time and the ordering of events, but it does not provide information about specific events or their outcomes. To determine whether the statement \"It will be raining hard at noon tomorrow\" is true or false, you would need to consult a reliable weather forecast or use a predictive model based on meteorological data."
