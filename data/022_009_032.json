    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we will use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{\\frac{(x-3)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^3}}{\\frac{(x-3)^n}{n^3}} \\right| $$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{(x-3) n^3}{(n+1)^3} \\right| $$\n\nNow, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $n^3$:\n\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{(x-3)}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^3} \\right| $$\n\nAs $n$ approaches infinity, the fraction $\\frac{1}{n}$ approaches 0, so the expression becomes:\n\n$$ \\left| (x-3) \\right| $$\n\nFor the series to converge, the Ratio Test requires that this expression be less than 1:\n\n$$ \\left| (x-3) \\right| < 1 $$\n\nThis inequality represents the interval of convergence:\n\n$$ -1 < x - 3 < 1 $$\n\nAdd 3 to all sides of the inequality:\n\n$$ 2 < x < 4 $$\n\nThe interval of convergence is $(2, 4)$. The radius of convergence is half the length of this interval, which is:\n\n$$ R = \\frac{4 - 2}{2} = 1 $$\n\nSo, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is $(2, 4)$."
