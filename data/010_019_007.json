    "message_1": "Consider a simplicial complex $K$ with $10$ vertices and $15$ edges. The Morse function $f:K\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is defined as follows: $f(v)=0$ for every vertex $v\\in K$ and $f(e)=1$ for every edge $e\\in K$. Compute the Morse homology of $K$ with respect to $f$, i.e., calculate the Betti numbers of the Morse complex associated to $(K,f)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology of the simplicial complex $K$ with respect to the Morse function $f$, we first need to understand the critical simplices of $f$. Recall that a simplex $\\sigma$ is critical if $f(\\sigma) > f(\\tau)$ for all faces $\\tau \\subsetneq \\sigma$ and $f(\\sigma) < f(\\rho)$ for all cofaces $\\rho \\supsetneq \\sigma$.\n\nSince $f(v) = 0$ for all vertices $v \\in K$ and $f(e) = 1$ for all edges $e \\in K$, we can see that all vertices are critical simplices, as they have no faces with higher function values. Similarly, all edges are also critical simplices, as they have no cofaces with lower function values.\n\nNow, let's compute the Betti numbers of the Morse complex associated to $(K, f)$. The Betti numbers are given by the ranks of the homology groups of the Morse complex.\n\nSince all vertices are critical simplices, the 0th Betti number, $b_0$, is equal to the number of vertices in $K$, which is 10.\n\nSince all edges are critical simplices, the 1st Betti number, $b_1$, is equal to the number of edges in $K$, which is 15.\n\nThere are no critical simplices of dimension 2 or higher, so the Betti numbers for higher dimensions are all 0.\n\nThus, the Betti numbers of the Morse complex associated to $(K, f)$ are $b_0 = 10$, $b_1 = 15$, and $b_i = 0$ for $i \\geq 2$."
