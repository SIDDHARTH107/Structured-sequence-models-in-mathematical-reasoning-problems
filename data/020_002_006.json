    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products, A and B, using two machines, X and Y. Machine X can process both types of products but machine Y can only process type B. The total processing time for one unit of product A on machine X is 4 hours and the total processing time for one unit of product B on machine X is 5 hours. The total processing time for one unit of product B on machine Y is 6 hours. If the manufacturer has 200 hours of machine X time and 100 hours of machine Y time available, how many units of product A and B should be produced in order to maximize the total production volume?",
