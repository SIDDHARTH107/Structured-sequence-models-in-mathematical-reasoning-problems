    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 60. We want to determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structure of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted by n_p, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_p divides the order of G\n2. n_p is congruent to 1 mod p\n\nFor p = 2, we have n_2 | 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, or 15.\n\nFor p = 3, we have n_3 | 20 and n_3 ≡ 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 or 10.\n\nFor p = 5, we have n_5 | 12 and n_5 ≡ 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (n_5 = n_3 = 1), then these subgroups are normal in G. Let P_5 and P_3 be these subgroups. Since the orders of P_5 and P_3 are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, and their product has order 15. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 15, which is isomorphic to C15. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60.\n\n2. If G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup (n_5 = 1) but not a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (n_3 = 10), then G has a normal subgroup of order 5. Let P_5 be this subgroup, and let P_3 be any Sylow 3-subgroup of G. The product of P_5 and P_3 has order 15, and G can be written as a semi-direct product of P_5 and P_3. In this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2.\n\n3. If G does not have a unique Sylow 5-subgroup (n_5 = 6) and does not have a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (n_3 = 10), then G has no normal subgroups of order 5 or 3. In this case, G is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we need to analyze the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in G. If G has unique Sylow 5 and 3-subgroups, it is isomorphic to C60. If G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup but not a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, it is isomorphic to A5 × C2. Otherwise, G is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
