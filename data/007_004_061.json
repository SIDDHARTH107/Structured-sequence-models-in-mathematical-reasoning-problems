    "message_2": "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 128 and 144, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (144) by the smaller number (128) and find the remainder.\n144 รท 128 = 1 with a remainder of 16.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (144) with the smaller number (128) and the smaller number with the remainder (16).\nNow, we need to find the GCD of 128 and 16.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (128) by the smaller number (16) and find the remainder.\n128 รท 16 = 8 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the smaller number, which is 16.\n\nSo, the GCD of 128 and 144 is 16."
