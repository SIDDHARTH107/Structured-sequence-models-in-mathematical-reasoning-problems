This point is a simple pole of the function. \n\nTo analytically continue the function along the real axis, we need to find a function that agrees with $f(z)$ in the unit disc and is analytic in a region containing the path from $0$ to $1$. One way to do this is to consider a small detour around the point $z = 1$.\n\nLet $\\epsilon > 0$ be a small positive number, and consider the path $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ that goes from $0$ to $1-\\epsilon$, then makes a small semicircular detour around $z = 1$ in the upper half-plane with radius $\\epsilon$, and finally goes from $1+\\epsilon$ to $1$. We can parametrize this path as follows:\n\n1. For $0 \\leq t \\leq 1-\\epsilon$, let $\\gamma_\\epsilon(t) = t$.\n2. For $1-\\epsilon \\leq t \\leq 1+\\epsilon$, let $\\gamma_\\epsilon(t) = 1 + \\epsilon e^{i\\pi(t-1+\\epsilon)}$.\n3. For $1+\\epsilon \\leq t \\leq 2$, let $\\gamma_\\epsilon(t) = t - \\epsilon$.\n\nNow, we can define the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ along the path $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ by\n\n$$\ng_\\epsilon(z) = \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma_\\epsilon(z)}.\n$$\n\nThe function $g_\\epsilon(z)$ is analytic everywhere except at the point $z = 1$, where it has a simple pole. Moreover, $g_\\epsilon(z)$ agrees with $f(z)$ in the unit disc, since $\\gamma_\\epsilon(z)$ lies in the unit disc for $0 \\leq z \\leq 1-\\epsilon$.\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the path $\\gamma_\\epsilon$ converges to the real axis from $0$ to $1$, and the function $g_\\epsilon(z)$ converges to the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ along the real axis. Therefore, the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ along the real axis from $0$ to $1$ is given by\n\n$$\ng(z) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} g_\\epsilon(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z}.\n$$\n\nNote that this analytic continuation is still not defined at the point $z = 1$, where the function has a simple pole."
