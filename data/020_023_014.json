    "message_1": "Suppose there are three stocks A, B, and C with expected returns of 9%, 12%, and 15%, respectively. The standard deviations of the returns of stocks A, B, and C are 12%, 18%, and 24%, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the returns of the three stocks are as follows: r(A,B) = 0.5, r(A,C) = 0.3, and r(B,C) = 0.4. If you have $50,000 to invest, what is the optimal portfolio allocation to maximize the expected return while keeping the risk (measured by the standard deviation of the portfolio return) below 16%?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio allocation, we need to consider the weights of each stock in the portfolio. Let's denote the weights of stocks A, B, and C as w_A, w_B, and w_C, respectively. Since we are investing the entire $50,000, the sum of the weights should be equal to 1:\n\nw_A + w_B + w_C = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (E[R_p]) can be calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual stocks:\n\nE[R_p] = w_A * 9% + w_B * 12% + w_C * 15%\n\nThe risk of the portfolio, measured by the standard deviation (σ_p), can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσ_p^2 = (w_A * σ_A)^2 + (w_B * σ_B)^2 + (w_C * σ_C)^2 + 2 * w_A * w_B * σ_A * σ_B * r(A,B) + 2 * w_A * w_C * σ_A * σ_C * r(A,C) + 2 * w_B * w_C * σ_B * σ_C * r(B,C)\n\nwhere σ_A, σ_B, and σ_C are the standard deviations of stocks A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe want to maximize the expected return while keeping the risk below 16%, so we need to solve the following optimization problem:\n\nMaximize E[R_p] subject to σ_p ≤ 16% and w_A + w_B + w_C = 1\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem that can be solved using methods like the Lagrange multiplier technique or numerical optimization algorithms. However, due to the complexity of the problem, it is not possible to provide an exact solution here.\n\nInstead, you can use software like Excel Solver or Python libraries like SciPy to solve this optimization problem and find the optimal weights for stocks A, B, and C. Once you have the optimal weights, you can calculate the amount to invest in each stock by multiplying the weight by the total investment amount ($50,000)."
