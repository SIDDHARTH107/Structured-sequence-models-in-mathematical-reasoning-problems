    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2), we can apply the Sylow Theorems. In particular, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 divides the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which is 25/5 = 5.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only possibility for n_5 that satisfies both conditions is n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, say H, and by the Sylow Theorems, H is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the order of H. Since H is a Sylow 5-subgroup, its order must be 5. Thus, H is a cyclic group of order 5, generated by some element h of order 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of H is 5, the order of G/H is 25/5 = 5. Therefore, G/H is a cyclic group of order 5, generated by some coset gH, where g is an element of G.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then it is generated by a single element, say x, of order 25. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_25.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then there is no element of order 25 in G. We know that G is generated by the elements h and g, where h has order 5 and gH has order 5 in G/H. Since H is normal in G, we can form the direct product of H and the subgroup generated by g, say K. The order of K is 5, and since G is not cyclic, the order of g must be 5 as well.\n\nNow, we have G = HK, where H and K are both cyclic groups of order 5. Moreover, since H is normal in G, we can apply the Internal Direct Product Theorem, which states that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, i.e., G is isomorphic to H x K, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
