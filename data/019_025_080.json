    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the difference between the revenue and the cost, and then find the maximum value of that difference.\n\nLet R(x) be the revenue function, which is the product of the number of products (x) and the selling price ($50) per product. So, R(x) = 50x.\n\nThe profit function, P(x), is the difference between the revenue and the cost: P(x) = R(x) - C(x).\n\nSubstitute R(x) and C(x) into the profit function:\nP(x) = 50x - (0.5x^2 + 5x + 1200)\nP(x) = -0.5x^2 + 45x - 1200\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the profit function. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b / 2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n\nIn this case, a = -0.5 and b = 45. So,\nx = -45 / (2 * -0.5)\nx = 45\n\nSince the number of products must be a whole number, we can round x to the nearest integer. In this case, x = 45.\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 45 products to maximize its profit."
