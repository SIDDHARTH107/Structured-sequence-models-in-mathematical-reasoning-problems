    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that isolates x. \n\nGiven the equation: 2^(x+1) = 32\n\nFirst, we can rewrite 32 as a power of 2, since 32 = 2^5. So, the equation becomes:\n\n2^(x+1) = 2^5\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 1 = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 1 from both sides:\n\nx = 5 - 1\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solution is x = 4."
