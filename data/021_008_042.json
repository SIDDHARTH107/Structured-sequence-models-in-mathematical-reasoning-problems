    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method for a system of nonlinear equations, we need to compute the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nFor the given system of equations, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x   2y  |\n          | e^x  -1  |\n\nNow, we need to compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\nJ^(-1) = (1/det(J)) * |  d  -b |\n                       | -c   a |\n\nwhere det(J) = ad - bc.\n\nFor our Jacobian matrix, the determinant is det(J) = (-2x) - 2ye^x. The inverse of the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ^(-1) = (1/((-2x) - 2ye^x)) * | -1  -2y |\n                               | -e^x 2x |\n\nNow we can apply Newton's method. The iteration formula for Newton's method for a system of nonlinear equations is:\n\n(x, y) = (x, y) - J^(-1)(x, y) * F(x, y)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the vector of the functions [f1, f2].\n\nLet's apply two iterations of Newton's method starting with the initial values (x0, y0) = (-1, 4):\n\nIteration 1:\nF(-1, 4) = [(-1)^2 + 4^2 - 9, e^(-1) - 4 - 1] = [8, -3]\nJ^(-1)(-1, 4) = (1/((-2(-1)) - 2(4)e^(-1))) * | -1  -8 |\n                                                 | -e^(-1) 2(-1) |\n\n(x1, y1) = (-1, 4) - J^(-1)(-1, 4) * F(-1, 4)\n\nAfter calculating, we get:\n(x1, y1) ≈ (-0.4429, 2.8857)\n\nIteration 2:\nF(-0.4429, 2.8857) ≈ [0.0186, 0.0674]\nJ^(-1)(-0.4429, 2.8857) ≈ (1/((-2(-0.4429)) - 2(2.8857)e^(-0.4429))) * | -1  -5.7714 |\n                                                                           | -e^(-0.4429) 0.8858 |\n\n(x2, y2) = (-0.4429, 2.8857) - J^(-1)(-0.4429, 2.8857) * F(-0.4429, 2.8857)\n\nAfter calculating, we get:\n(x2, y2) ≈ (-0.4517, 2.9043)\n\nSo after two iterations, the values of x and y are approximately x ≈ -0.4517 and y ≈ 2.9043."
