    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A (denoted as A'), we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. The universal set U is given as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. \n\nSet A = {2, 4, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the elements in U that are not in A:\n\n1 is not in A, so it's in A'.\n2 is in A, so it's not in A'.\n3 is not in A, so it's in A'.\n4 is in A, so it's not in A'.\n5 is not in A, so it's in A'.\n6 is in A, so it's not in A'.\n\nSo, the complement of set A, A' = {1, 3, 5}.\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and its complement A’:\n\nA ∪ A' = {2, 4, 6} ∪ {1, 3, 5}\n\nTo find the union, we combine all the elements from both sets without repeating any elements:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nAs we can see, the union of set A and its complement A’ is the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}."
