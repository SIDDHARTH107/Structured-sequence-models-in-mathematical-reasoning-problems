    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 6 cm and 8 cm with an included angle of 120 degrees. What is the perimeter of the triangle, found via trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the included angle between sides a and b.\n\nIn this case, a = 6 cm, b = 8 cm, and the included angle C = 120 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (120 * π) / 180 = (2 * π) / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = (6)² + (8)² - 2(6)(8) * cos((2 * π) / 3)\nc² = 36 + 64 - 96 * cos((2 * π) / 3)\nc² = 100 - 96 * (-1/2)\nc² = 100 + 48\nc² = 148\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √148 ≈ 12.17 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the third side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c = 6 + 8 + 12.17 ≈ 26.17 cm"
