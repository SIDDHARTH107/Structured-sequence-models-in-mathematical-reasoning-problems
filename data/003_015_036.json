    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x + π/4), we need to analyze the function and compare it to the general form of a sine function, which is A*sin(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our given function, f(x) = 2sin(3x + π/4), we can see that:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 2\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 2, so the amplitude is 2.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In our function, B = 3. So, the period is (2π)/3.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x + π/4) is 2, and the period is (2π)/3."
