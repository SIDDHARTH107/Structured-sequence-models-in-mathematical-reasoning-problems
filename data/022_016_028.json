Find a conformal map f that maps the region E onto the upper half-plane H = {z ∈ ℂ : Im(z) > 0}, such that f(1/4) = i.\n\nHint: Start by finding a similar problem that has a well-known solution, and use it to guide your steps in solving the given problem.",
    "message_2": "To find a conformal map f that maps the region E onto the upper half-plane H, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Map the region E to a rectangle with vertices at 0, 1, i, and 1+i.\n2. Map the rectangle to a strip in the upper half-plane.\n3. Map the strip to the upper half-plane H.\n\nStep 1: Map the region E to a rectangle.\nLet g(z) = 2z, then g maps E to a rectangle with vertices at 0, 1, i, and 1+i. Note that g(1/4) = 1/2.\n\nStep 2: Map the rectangle to a strip in the upper half-plane.\nLet h(z) = e^(πiz), then h maps the rectangle to a strip in the upper half-plane with real part between 0 and 1. Note that h(1/2) = e^(πi/2) = i.\n\nStep 3: Map the strip to the upper half-plane H.\nLet k(z) = (z-1)/(z+1), then k maps the strip to the upper half-plane H. Note that k(i) = i.\n\nNow, let f(z) = k(h(g(z))). Then f maps the region E onto the upper half-plane H, and f(1/4) = k(h(g(1/4))) = k(h(1/2)) = k(i) = i."
