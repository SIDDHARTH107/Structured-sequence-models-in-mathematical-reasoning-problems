    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = 4x^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = 4, we will use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = 4x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2) * 4x^(1/2) = 6x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we'll square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(6x^(1/2))^2 = 36x\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + 36x\n\nNext, we'll find the square root of the expression:\n\nsqrt(1 + 36x)\n\nNow, we'll set up the integral:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + 36x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we'll use substitution. Let u = 1 + 36x, then du = 36 dx. We also need to change the limits of integration:\n\nx = 0 -> u = 1 + 36(0) = 1\nx = 4 -> u = 1 + 36(4) = 145\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 145] sqrt(u) * (1/36) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (1/36) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 145]\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nL = (1/54) * (145^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL ≈ (1/54) * (1743.38 - 1) ≈ 32.26\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = 4x^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = 4 is approximately 32.26 units."
