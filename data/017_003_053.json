    "message_2": "To prove that every group of prime order p = 11 is cyclic, we will show that there exists an element in the group that generates the entire group.\n\nLet G be a group of order 11. Since 11 is a prime number, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Thus, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 11.\n\nWe know that the identity element e of G has order 1. Now, let's consider any other element a ∈ G, where a ≠ e. Since the order of a must divide 11, and the only divisors of 11 are 1 and 11, the order of a cannot be 1 (otherwise, a would be the identity element). Therefore, the order of a must be 11.\n\nRecall that the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e. Since the order of a is 11, we have a^11 = e. Now, let's consider the subgroup H generated by a, i.e., H = {a^0, a^1, a^2, ..., a^10}. Since a has order 11, all these elements are distinct, and thus, H has 11 elements.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G and has the same number of elements as G, we can conclude that H = G. Therefore, G is generated by the element a, and G is a cyclic group. This proves that every group of prime order p = 11 is cyclic."
