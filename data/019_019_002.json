    "message_1": "What is the maximum number of states a Turing machine can have if its alphabet consists of only two symbols: 0 and 1, and the maximum length of its tape is 100?",
    "message_2": "There is no theoretical maximum number of states a Turing machine can have, as it depends on the specific problem the machine is designed to solve. The number of states is independent of the alphabet size and the tape length. You can have a Turing machine with as many states as you want, even with a small alphabet and limited tape length. However, the complexity of the problems that can be solved by a Turing machine with a limited tape length will be restricted."
