    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z = 1, we first need to rewrite the function in a way that isolates the singular part at z = 1. We can do this by factoring the denominator and then using partial fraction decomposition.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)\n\nNow we can rewrite f(z) as a sum of partial fractions:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 2z - 3) / ((z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)) = A / (z - 1) + (Bz + C) / (z^2 + z + 1)\n\nTo find the constants A, B, and C, we clear the denominators:\n\nz^2 + 2z - 3 = A(z^2 + z + 1) + (Bz + C)(z - 1)\n\nNow we can find the constants by plugging in the pole z = 1:\n\n1^2 + 2(1) - 3 = A(1^2 + 1 + 1) + (B + C)(1 - 1)\n\n0 = 3A\n\nA = 0\n\nSince A = 0, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nz^2 + 2z - 3 = (Bz + C)(z - 1)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\nz^2 + 2z - 3 = Bz^2 - Bz + Cz - C\n\nNow we can equate the coefficients of the powers of z:\n\nB = 1 (coefficient of z^2)\nC - B = 2 => C - 1 = 2 => C = 3 (coefficient of z)\n\nNow we have the partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = 0 / (z - 1) + (z + 3) / (z^2 + z + 1)\n\nSince the residue is the coefficient of the term (z - 1)^(-1) in the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 1, and there is no such term in the decomposition we found, the residue of f(z) at the pole z = 1 is 0."
