    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 4 = 0 for x, we can try to find the roots of the equation. Since it is a cubic equation, it may have up to three real roots or one real root and a pair of complex conjugate roots.\n\nWe can first try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nFor our polynomial, the constant term is 4 and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of 4 are ±1, ±2, and ±4, and the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±1/2, and ±2/1.\n\nWe can test these possible rational roots by plugging them into the polynomial equation:\n\nFor x = 1:\n2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 3(1) + 4 = 2 - 5 + 3 + 4 = 4 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -1:\n2(-1)^3 - 5(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 4 = -2 - 5 - 3 + 4 = -6 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = 2:\n2(2)^3 - 5(2)^2 + 3(2) + 4 = 16 - 20 + 6 + 4 = 6 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -2:\n2(-2)^3 - 5(-2)^2 + 3(-2) + 4 = -16 - 20 - 6 + 4 = -38 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = 4:\n2(4)^3 - 5(4)^2 + 3(4) + 4 = 128 - 80 + 12 + 4 = 64 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -4:\n2(-4)^3 - 5(-4)^2 + 3(-4) + 4 = -128 - 80 - 12 + 4 = -216 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = 1/2:\n2(1/2)^3 - 5(1/2)^2 + 3(1/2) + 4 = 1/4 - 5/4 + 3/2 + 4 = 0\n\nSo, x = 1/2 is a rational root of the polynomial equation.\n\nNow that we have found one root, we can perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n       ______________________\n1/2  |  2    -5     3     4\n          1    -2    -1\n       ______________________\n           2    -4     1     3\n\nThe resulting quadratic is 2x^2 - 4x + 1. We can now solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(2)(1))) / (2(2))\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 8)) / 4\nx = (4 ± √8) / 4\nx = (4 ± 2√2) / 4\n\nThe two remaining roots are x = (4 + 2√2) / 4 and x = (4 - 2√2) / 4.\n\nSo, the solutions to the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 4 = 0 are x = 1/2, x = (4 + 2√2) / 4, and x = (4 - 2√2) / 4."
