    "message_1": "The Traveler's Dilemma involves two players who each choose a number between 2 and 100 without knowing the otherâ€™s choice. The players win the smaller amount of their two choices, however, a bonus of $2 is awarded to the player who chooses the larger number, as long as the difference between the two numbers is less than or equal to 10. \n\nWrite a question for the math student to solve: \n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for the Traveler's Dilemma game? In other words, what number should each player choose to maximize their chances of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for the Traveler's Dilemma game, we need to analyze the possible outcomes and determine which number each player should choose to maximize their chances of winning the game.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If both players choose the same number, they will both win that amount, and no bonus will be awarded.\n\n2. If one player chooses a number that is more than 10 units larger than the other player's number, they will win the smaller number without the bonus.\n\n3. If one player chooses a number that is less than or equal to 10 units larger than the other player's number, they will win the smaller number plus the $2 bonus.\n\nTo maximize their chances of winning, each player should choose a number that minimizes the risk of losing the bonus while maximizing the potential payout. This can be achieved by choosing a number that is 10 units less than the maximum possible choice (100), which is 90.\n\nBy choosing 90, a player ensures that they will always receive the bonus if the other player chooses a number between 80 and 100. If the other player chooses a number less than 80, the player who chose 90 will still win the smaller amount without the bonus, but the difference in winnings will be minimal.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy for the Traveler's Dilemma game is for each player to choose the number 90."
