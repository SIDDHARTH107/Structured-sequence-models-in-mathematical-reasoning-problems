    "message_1": "What is the correlation coefficient between two variables, X and Y, if their covariance is 25 and the standard deviations of X and Y are 5 and 2, respectively?",
    "message_2": "The correlation coefficient (r) between two variables X and Y can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr = Cov(X, Y) / (SD(X) * SD(Y))\n\nwhere Cov(X, Y) is the covariance between X and Y, and SD(X) and SD(Y) are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively.\n\nGiven the covariance is 25 and the standard deviations of X and Y are 5 and 2, respectively, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = 25 / (5 * 2)\n\nr = 25 / 10\n\nr = 2.5\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the two variables X and Y is 2.5. However, it's important to note that the correlation coefficient should always be between -1 and 1. The value of 2.5 indicates that there might be an error in the given data or calculation. Please double-check the provided values to ensure their accuracy."
