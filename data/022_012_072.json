    "message_2": "To find the residues of $f(z)$ at its poles, we need more information about the function itself. However, I can provide you with the general method to find the residues at simple and double poles.\n\nFor a simple pole at $z=a$:\n\nThe residue of $f(z)$ at a simple pole $z=a$ can be found using the following formula:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), a) = \\lim_{z \\to a} (z-a) f(z)$$\n\nFor a double pole at $z=b$:\n\nThe residue of $f(z)$ at a double pole $z=b$ can be found using the following formula:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), b) = \\lim_{z \\to b} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left((z-b)^2 f(z)\\right)$$\n\nIf you provide more information about the function $f(z)$, I can help you find the residues at the given poles."
