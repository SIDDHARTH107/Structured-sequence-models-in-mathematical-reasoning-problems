    "message_2": "To find the shortest path (geodesic) between the points $(3,0,0)$ and $(0,0,3)$ on the surface of the sphere, we can use the great circle distance formula. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and the shortest path between two points on a sphere lies along the great circle that connects those two points.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Cartesian coordinates $(3,0,0)$ and $(0,0,3)$ to spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, a point is represented by $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, where $r$ is the distance from the origin, $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle from the positive z-axis), and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane).\n\nFor the point $(3,0,0)$:\n$r = 3$\n$\\theta = \\arccos(\\frac{0}{3}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n$\\phi = \\arctan(\\frac{0}{3}) = 0$\n\nSo, $(3,0,0)$ in spherical coordinates is $(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$.\n\nFor the point $(0,0,3)$:\n$r = 3$\n$\\theta = \\arccos(\\frac{3}{3}) = 0$\n$\\phi = \\arctan(\\frac{0}{0})$ (undefined, but we can take it as $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$)\n\nSo, $(0,0,3)$ in spherical coordinates is $(3, 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n\nNow, we can use the great circle distance formula to find the shortest path between these two points on the surface of the sphere:\n\n$d = r \\arccos(\\sin(\\theta_1) \\sin(\\theta_2) \\cos(\\phi_1 - \\phi_2) + \\cos(\\theta_1) \\cos(\\theta_2))$\n\nPlugging in the values for our points:\n\n$d = 3 \\arccos(\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\sin(0) \\cos(0 - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\cos(0))$\n\n$d = 3 \\arccos(0 + 0)$\n\n$d = 3 \\arccos(0)$\n\n$d = 3 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n\n$d = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$\n\nSo, the shortest path (geodesic) between the points $(3,0,0)$ and $(0,0,3)$ on the surface of the sphere is $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$."
