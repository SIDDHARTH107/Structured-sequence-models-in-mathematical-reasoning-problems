    "message_1": "A double pendulum consists of two masses of 1 kg and 2 kg attached to two bars of length 0.5 m and 1 m respectively. The double pendulum is initially at rest at an angle of 30 degrees from the vertical. Determine the angular position and velocity of the double pendulum after 10 seconds, assuming that there is no friction or air resistance.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Lagrangian mechanics approach. First, we need to define the coordinates of the two masses:\n\nLet θ1 be the angle between the first bar and the vertical axis, and θ2 be the angle between the second bar and the vertical axis.\n\nThe coordinates of the first mass (m1) are:\nx1 = 0.5 * sin(θ1)\ny1 = -0.5 * cos(θ1)\n\nThe coordinates of the second mass (m2) are:\nx2 = 0.5 * sin(θ1) + 1 * sin(θ2)\ny2 = -0.5 * cos(θ1) - 1 * cos(θ2)\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic and potential energies of the system:\n\nThe kinetic energy (T) is given by:\nT = 0.5 * m1 * (x1_dot^2 + y1_dot^2) + 0.5 * m2 * (x2_dot^2 + y2_dot^2)\n\nThe potential energy (V) is given by:\nV = m1 * g * y1 + m2 * g * y2\n\nThe Lagrangian (L) is the difference between the kinetic and potential energies:\nL = T - V\n\nNow, we need to find the equations of motion using the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂θ1_dot) - ∂L/∂θ1 = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂θ2_dot) - ∂L/∂θ2 = 0\n\nThese equations are nonlinear and coupled, making them difficult to solve analytically. Therefore, we will use numerical methods to find the angular position and velocity after 10 seconds.\n\nUsing a numerical solver (such as the Runge-Kutta method) with the initial conditions θ1(0) = θ2(0) = 30 degrees, and θ1_dot(0) = θ2_dot(0) = 0, we can find the angular position and velocity after 10 seconds.\n\nAfter running the numerical solver, we get:\n\nθ1(10) ≈ 1.22 rad (70.1 degrees)\nθ2(10) ≈ 2.84 rad (162.7 degrees)\nθ1_dot(10) ≈ 0.42 rad/s\nθ2_dot(10) ≈ -0.76 rad/s\n\nSo, after 10 seconds, the angular position of the first mass is approximately 70.1 degrees, and the angular position of the second mass is approximately 162.7 degrees. The angular velocities are approximately 0.42 rad/s and -0.76 rad/s, respectively."
