    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 9x^2 + 15x + 6, we can first find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients, which is 3. We can then factor out the GCF from the polynomial:\n\n3(3x^2 + 5x + 2)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two binomials of the form (ax + b)(cx + d) such that:\n\n1. a * c = 3 (the coefficient of x^2)\n2. b * d = 2 (the constant term)\n3. a * d + b * c = 5 (the coefficient of x)\n\nBy trial and error, we can find that a = 3, b = 1, c = 1, and d = 2 satisfy these conditions:\n\n(3x + 1)(x + 2)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n3(3x + 1)(x + 2)"
