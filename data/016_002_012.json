    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to each side. After each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nLet's denote the number of segments after n iterations as S(n) and the length of each segment after n iterations as L(n). Initially, S(0) = 3 (the three sides of the equilateral triangle) and L(0) = 1 (the length of each side).\n\nAfter the first iteration, the number of segments increases to S(1) = 3 * (4/3) = 4, and the length of each segment becomes L(1) = 1/3 (since each side is divided into three equal parts).\n\nIn general, after n iterations, we have:\n\nS(n) = 3 * (4/3)^n\nL(n) = (1/3)^n\n\nNow, we want to find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after four iterations. The perimeter is the product of the number of segments and the length of each segment:\n\nPerimeter(n) = S(n) * L(n)\n\nFor n = 4:\n\nPerimeter(4) = S(4) * L(4)\nPerimeter(4) = 3 * (4/3)^4 * (1/3)^4\nPerimeter(4) = 3 * (256/81) * (1/81)\nPerimeter(4) = (768/6561)\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after four iterations is 768/6561 units."
