    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that can be constructed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half. The length of the curve increases with each order (or iteration) of folding.\n\nFor the Heighway Dragon Curve, the length of the curve at each order is given by the formula:\n\nLength = Initial segment length * 2^(Order/2)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1 unit, and the order is 7. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * 2^(7/2)\n\nLength = 1 * 2^(3.5)\n\nLength = 1 * (2^3 * 2^0.5)\n\nLength = 1 * (8 * √2)\n\nLength = 8√2 units\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway Dragon Curve of order 7 with an initial segment length of 1 unit is 8√2 units."
