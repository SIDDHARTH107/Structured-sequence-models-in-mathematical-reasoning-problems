    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 1 meter away from the center of the wire on the axis of the semi-circle, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB at a point P due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length of the wire, r is the position vector from the wire element to the point P, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince we are dealing with a semi-circular wire, we can parameterize the wire using the angle θ as follows:\n\nx(θ) = 2cos(θ)\ny(θ) = 2sin(θ)\n\nThe infinitesimal length dl can be expressed as:\n\ndl = sqrt((dx/dθ)² + (dy/dθ)²) dθ\n\nwhere dx/dθ = -2sin(θ) and dy/dθ = 2cos(θ). Thus,\n\ndl = 2dθ\n\nNow, we can express the position vector r as:\n\nr = (2cos(θ) - 0)i + (2sin(θ) - 0)j + (1 - 0)k\n\nThe magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = sqrt((2cos(θ))² + (2sin(θ))² + 1²) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (2dθ) x ((2cos(θ))i + (2sin(θ))j + k)\n\nCalculating the cross product, we get:\n\ndl x r = -2sin(θ)dθ i + 2cos(θ)dθ j + 4dθ k\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (10 * (-2sin(θ)dθ i + 2cos(θ)dθ j + 4dθ k)) / (sqrt(5))³\n\nIntegrating this expression over the semi-circle (θ from 0 to π) will give us the total magnetic field at the point 1 meter away from the center of the wire on the axis of the semi-circle:\n\nB = (μ₀I / 4π) * ∫((-2sin(θ)dθ i + 2cos(θ)dθ j + 4dθ k)) / (sqrt(5))³ dθ, from θ = 0 to π\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nB = (μ₀I / 4π) * (0 i + 0 j + (8/3) k)\n\nSubstituting the values of μ₀ and I, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 10 A) / 4π * (8/3) k = (8/3) * 10⁻⁶ T k\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 1 meter away from the center of the wire on the axis of the semi-circle is (8/3) * 10⁻⁶ T in the k direction."
