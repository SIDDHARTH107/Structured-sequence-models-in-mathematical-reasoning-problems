    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly replacing each line segment with a pattern of smaller line segments. In the case of the Vicsek fractal, each line segment is replaced by 5 smaller line segments, arranged in a cross shape.\n\nLet's analyze the number of line segments at each iteration:\n\n1. Initial shape (0th iteration): 1 line segment\n2. 1st iteration: 1 line segment is replaced by 5 line segments (5 segments total)\n3. 2nd iteration: Each of the 5 line segments is replaced by 5 smaller line segments (5 * 5 = 25 segments total)\n4. 3rd iteration: Each of the 25 line segments is replaced by 5 smaller line segments (25 * 5 = 125 segments total)\n5. 4th iteration: Each of the 125 line segments is replaced by 5 smaller line segments (125 * 5 = 625 segments total)\n\nSo, in the 4th iteration of the Vicsek fractal, there are 625 line segments."
