    "message_2": "First, we need to check if the coefficient matrix is indeed singular. The coefficient matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n5 & 6 & 7\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTo check if it's singular, we need to find its determinant. If the determinant is zero, then the matrix is singular.\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 1(3\\cdot7 - 4\\cdot6) - 1(2\\cdot7 - 4\\cdot5) + 1(2\\cdot6 - 3\\cdot5)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 1(-3) - 1(-2) + 1(-3) = -3 + 2 - 3 = -4\n\\]\n\nSince the determinant is not zero, the coefficient matrix is not singular. Therefore, the problem statement is incorrect, and we cannot proceed with the method of elimination for a singular matrix. However, we can still solve the system of linear equations using the method of elimination for a non-singular matrix.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second equation, and multiply the first equation by -5 and add it to the third equation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx + y + z = 4 \\\\\n-2(x + y + z) + (2x + 3y + 4z) = -2(4) + 11 \\\\\n-5(x + y + z) + (5x + 6y + 7z) = -5(4) + 20\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx + y + z = 4 \\\\\ny + 2z = 3 \\\\\ny + 2z = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can eliminate y from the third equation by subtracting the second equation from the third equation:\n\n\\[\n(y + 2z) - (y + 2z) = 0 - 3\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n0 = -3\n\\]\n\nThis equation is not true, which means the system of linear equations is inconsistent and has no solution."
