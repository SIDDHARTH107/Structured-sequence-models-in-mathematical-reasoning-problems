    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to find the chromatic number of the graph. The chromatic number is the smallest number of colors that can be used to color a graph in this way.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices. For a graph with 7 vertices, the chromatic number would be 7.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not a complete graph, the chromatic number could be smaller. The minimum number of colors required depends on the structure of the graph and the maximum degree of any vertex (the maximum number of edges connected to a single vertex).\n\nIn general, the chromatic number of a graph is at most one more than the maximum degree of any vertex. This is known as the Brooks' theorem. Therefore, if the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph is Δ, then the minimum number of colors required is at most Δ + 1.\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph and the degrees of its vertices, we cannot determine the exact minimum number of colors required. However, we can say that the minimum number of colors required is at most 8 (if the maximum degree is 7) and at least 2 (if the graph is not a complete graph)."
