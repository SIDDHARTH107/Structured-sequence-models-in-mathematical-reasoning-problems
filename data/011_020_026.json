    "message_2": "Let's use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We have 7 employees (stars) and we want to divide them into 4 projects (3 bars).\n\nFor example, a possible assignment could look like this:\n\n**|*|***|*\n\nThis represents 2 employees in the first project, 1 employee in the second project, 3 employees in the third project, and 1 employee in the fourth project.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars. We have a total of 7 stars and 3 bars, which is 10 objects. We need to choose 3 positions for the bars out of the 10 positions, and the stars will fill the remaining positions.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 10 (total objects) and k = 3 (bars):\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1)\nC(10, 3) = 720 / 6\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nSo there are 120 possible ways to assign the 7 employees to the 4 projects."
