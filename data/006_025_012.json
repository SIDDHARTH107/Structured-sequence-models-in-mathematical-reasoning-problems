    "message_2": "There is an error in the problem statement. A standard deck of 52 cards has only 1 Ace of Hearts. Assuming it is a standard deck, the probability of selecting the Ace of Hearts would be:\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes (selecting Ace of Hearts) = 1\nTotal number of possible outcomes (total cards in the deck) = 52\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 1 / 52"
