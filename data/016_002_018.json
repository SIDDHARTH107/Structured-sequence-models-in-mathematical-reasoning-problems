    "message_1": "A Koch snowflake is formed by removing an equilateral triangle from the middle third of each side of an equilateral triangle, and then repeating the process on the remaining line segments indefinitely. If the original equilateral triangle has a side length of 3 cm, what is the perimeter of the resulting Koch snowflake after three iterations?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after three iterations, we need to understand how the perimeter changes with each iteration. \n\nIn the first iteration, we remove the middle third of each side of the original equilateral triangle and add two segments of equal length. This means that for each side, we replace the original segment with 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original. So, the perimeter after the first iteration is 3 * (4 * (1/3)) = 4 cm per side, or 12 cm total.\n\nIn the second iteration, we repeat the process for each of the 4 segments on each side. Each segment is now 1/3 the length of the segments from the previous iteration, so each segment is 1/9 the length of the original side. We replace each segment with 4 segments of this new length, so the perimeter after the second iteration is 3 * (4^2 * (1/3^2)) = 16 cm per side, or 48 cm total.\n\nIn the third iteration, we repeat the process again for each of the 16 segments on each side. Each segment is now 1/3 the length of the segments from the previous iteration, so each segment is 1/27 the length of the original side. We replace each segment with 4 segments of this new length, so the perimeter after the third iteration is 3 * (4^3 * (1/3^3)) = 64 cm per side, or 192 cm total.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the resulting Koch snowflake after three iterations is 192 cm."
