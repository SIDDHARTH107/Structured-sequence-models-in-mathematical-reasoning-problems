    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient at any point x.\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 - 4x)/dx = 4x - 4\n\nNow, we will perform 5 iterations of gradient descent with an initial guess of x0 = 3 and a learning rate of 0.1.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - learning_rate * f'(x0)\nx1 = 3 - 0.1 * (4 * 3 - 4)\nx1 = 3 - 0.1 * 8\nx1 = 3 - 0.8\nx1 = 2.2\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - learning_rate * f'(x1)\nx2 = 2.2 - 0.1 * (4 * 2.2 - 4)\nx2 = 2.2 - 0.1 * 4.4\nx2 = 2.2 - 0.44\nx2 = 1.76\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - learning_rate * f'(x2)\nx3 = 1.76 - 0.1 * (4 * 1.76 - 4)\nx3 = 1.76 - 0.1 * 3.04\nx3 = 1.76 - 0.304\nx3 = 1.456\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = x3 - learning_rate * f'(x3)\nx4 = 1.456 - 0.1 * (4 * 1.456 - 4)\nx4 = 1.456 - 0.1 * 1.824\nx4 = 1.456 - 0.1824\nx4 = 1.2736\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = x4 - learning_rate * f'(x4)\nx5 = 1.2736 - 0.1 * (4 * 1.2736 - 4)\nx5 = 1.2736 - 0.1 * 1.0944\nx5 = 1.2736 - 0.10944\nx5 = 1.16416\n\nAfter 5 iterations, our estimate for the minimum value of x is x5 = 1.16416. To find the minimum value of the function f(x), we can plug this value back into the original function:\n\nf(x5) = 2 * (1.16416)^2 - 4 * 1.16416\nf(x5) = 2 * 1.35528 - 4.65664\nf(x5) = 2.71056 - 4.65664\nf(x5) = -1.94608\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x after 5 iterations of gradient descent is approximately -1.94608."
