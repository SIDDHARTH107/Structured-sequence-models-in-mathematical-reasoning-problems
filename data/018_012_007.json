    "message_2": "First, let's define the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ B. \n\nNow, let's find A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A x B) and A, denoted as (A x B) ∩ A. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, we are looking for elements that are in both A x B and A.\n\n(A x B) ∩ A = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nThere are no common elements between A x B and A, so the intersection is the empty set. Therefore, (A x B) ∩ A ≠ A.\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and (B x A), denoted as A ∩ (B x A). We are looking for elements that are in both A and B x A.\n\nA ∩ (B x A) = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nThere are no common elements between A and B x A, so the intersection is the empty set. Therefore, A ∩ (B x A) ≠ A.\n\nIn conclusion, the given statement is incorrect. The correct statement should be (A x B) ∩ A ≠ A and A ∩ (B x A) ≠ A."
