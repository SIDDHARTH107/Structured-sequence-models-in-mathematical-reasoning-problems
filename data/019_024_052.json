    "message_2": "Using abductive reasoning, we can infer that the statement \"All birds can fly\" is false. Here's the reasoning and explanation:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that all birds have wings. From statement 2, we know that penguins are birds. Since penguins are birds, they must have wings according to statement 1. However, we also know that penguins cannot fly, despite having wings. This is a well-known fact about penguins.\n\nTherefore, since there is at least one example of a bird (penguins) that cannot fly, the statement \"All birds can fly\" is false."
