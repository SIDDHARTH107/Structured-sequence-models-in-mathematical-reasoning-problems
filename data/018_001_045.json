    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A.\n\nThe empty set, denoted as âˆ…, has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A. By definition, a subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. Since there are no elements in the empty set to contradict this definition, the empty set is a subset of set A.\n\nThus, we have proven that the empty set is a subset of set A."
