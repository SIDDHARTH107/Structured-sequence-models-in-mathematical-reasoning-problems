    "message_1": "A company produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The profit per unit for each product is $10, $16, and $22, respectively. The company has a daily production capacity of 500 units. The company's production and sales team has forecasted a daily demand for the three types of products as follows: A (200 units), B (150 units), and C (100 units). Using Grey Wolf Optimizer, what should be the daily production of each product to maximize the profit of the company?",
    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. It is used to solve complex optimization problems. However, in this case, we can solve the problem using a simpler approach, as it is a linear programming problem.\n\nLet x, y, and z represent the daily production of products A, B, and C, respectively. We want to maximize the profit function P = 10x + 16y + 22z, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y + z ≤ 500 (daily production capacity)\n2. x ≤ 200 (daily demand for product A)\n3. y ≤ 150 (daily demand for product B)\n4. z ≤ 100 (daily demand for product C)\n5. x, y, z ≥ 0 (non-negative production)\n\nTo maximize the profit, we should prioritize producing the product with the highest profit per unit, which is product C. We will produce as many units of product C as possible without exceeding the daily demand and capacity constraints.\n\n1. Produce 100 units of product C (z = 100).\n2. The remaining daily production capacity is 500 - 100 = 400 units.\n3. Next, prioritize producing product B. Produce 150 units of product B (y = 150).\n4. The remaining daily production capacity is 400 - 150 = 250 units.\n5. Finally, produce product A. Produce 200 units of product A (x = 200), as it does not exceed the remaining daily production capacity.\n\nSo, the optimal daily production for each product to maximize the profit is:\n- Product A: 200 units\n- Product B: 150 units\n- Product C: 100 units\n\nThe maximum daily profit can be calculated as follows:\nP = 10x + 16y + 22z = 10(200) + 16(150) + 22(100) = 2000 + 2400 + 2200 = $6,600."
