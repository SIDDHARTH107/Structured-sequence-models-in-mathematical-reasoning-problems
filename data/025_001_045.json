    "message_2": "To use Bézout's theorem, we first need to rewrite the given equations as polynomial equations in homogeneous coordinates. Let X = x, Y = y, and Z = 1. Then, the given equations can be rewritten as:\n\n1) X² + Y² - 4Z² = 0\n2) 2X² - 2Y² - 2XZ + 4YZ - 3Z² = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the degrees of these two curves. The degree of a curve is the highest degree of any term in the equation. For the first equation, the degree is 2, and for the second equation, the degree is also 2.\n\nBézout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity, provided that the curves have no common components. In this case, the product of the degrees is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the two curves have any common components. To do this, we can compute the resultant of the two equations with respect to one of the variables, say X. The resultant is a polynomial in the other variable (Y and Z in this case) that vanishes if and only if the two original polynomials have a common root.\n\nComputing the resultant of the two equations with respect to X, we get:\n\nR(Y, Z) = (4Z² - Y²)(-3Z² + 4YZ - 2Y²) - (2Y² - 4Z²)(-2Z² + 4YZ - 2Y²)\n\nSimplifying R(Y, Z), we obtain:\n\nR(Y, Z) = 16Y²Z² - 16Y^4\n\nThis resultant is not identically zero, which means that the two curves do not have any common components.\n\nTherefore, by Bézout's theorem, the number of intersection points of the two curves is 4."
