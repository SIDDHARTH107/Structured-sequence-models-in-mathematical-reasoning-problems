    "message_2": "This graph does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. To see why this graph does not have a Hamiltonian cycle, let's analyze its structure.\n\nThe graph can be divided into two parts: the first part consists of vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the second part consists of vertices 5, 6, 7, and 8. The first part is a complete graph (K4) with all possible edges between its vertices. The second part is also a complete graph (K4). The only connection between these two parts is the edge (4,5).\n\nNow, let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle. Since there is only one edge connecting the two parts, any Hamiltonian cycle must use this edge. Without loss of generality, let's start at vertex 1. We can visit vertices 2, 3, and 4 in the first part. After visiting vertex 4, we must move to the second part using the edge (4,5). In the second part, we can visit vertices 6, 7, and 8. However, after visiting vertex 8, there is no way to return to vertex 1, as there is no edge connecting vertex 8 to vertex 1.\n\nTherefore, this graph does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle."
