    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (curved part) and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 4 cm.\n\nBase area (A) = π(4²) = 16π cm²\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. To do this, we first need to find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height, since the radius, height, and slant height form a right triangle:\n\nl² = r² + h²\nl² = 4² + 7²\nl² = 16 + 49\nl² = 65\nl = √65 ≈ 8.06 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area using the formula: LSA = πrl, where LSA is the lateral surface area, r is the radius, and l is the slant height.\n\nLateral surface area (LSA) = π(4)(8.06) ≈ 101.86 cm²\n\nFinally, we add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cone:\n\nTotal surface area = Base area + Lateral surface area\nTotal surface area = 16π + 101.86\nTotal surface area ≈ 50.27 + 101.86\nTotal surface area ≈ 152.13 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 152.13 cm²."
