In each iteration, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 3.\n\nIn the 0th iteration, there is 1 triangle (the initial triangle).\nIn the 1st iteration, there are 3 triangles.\nIn the 2nd iteration, there are 3^2 = 9 triangles.\nIn the 3rd iteration, there are 3^3 = 27 triangles.\nIn the 4th iteration, there are 3^4 = 81 triangles.\n\nIn the 5th iteration, there are 3^5 = 243 triangles."
