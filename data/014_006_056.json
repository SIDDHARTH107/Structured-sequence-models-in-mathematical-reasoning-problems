    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the One-time pad encryption technique, we first need to generate a random key consisting of 5 numbers between 0 and 25 (inclusive). Let's generate the key:\n\nKey: 12, 3, 17, 22, 8\n\nNow, we will convert the message \"HELLO\" into its corresponding numerical values using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\nHELLO: 7, 4, 11, 11, 14\n\nNext, we will add the key values to the message values modulo 26:\n\nEncrypted message:\n(7+12) mod 26 = 19\n(4+3) mod 26 = 7\n(11+17) mod 26 = 2\n(11+22) mod 26 = 7\n(14+8) mod 26 = 22\n\nEncrypted message: 19, 7, 2, 7, 22\n\nFinally, we will convert the encrypted message back into letters:\n\nEncrypted message: \"TCHGW\"\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"TCHGW\" and the key used for encryption is 12, 3, 17, 22, 8."
