    "message_2": "First, let's count the number of vowels and consonants in the word \"INTUITIONISTIC\". There are 6 vowels (5 I's and 1 U) and 8 consonants (2 N's, 2 T's, 1 S, and 3 C's).\n\nSince the vowels must be grouped together, we can treat the group of vowels as a single unit. So, we have 9 units to arrange: 8 consonants and 1 group of vowels.\n\nThere are 9! ways to arrange these 9 units. However, we need to account for the repetitions of the consonants (2 N's, 2 T's, and 3 C's). So, we divide by the repetitions:\n\n9! / (2! * 2! * 3!) = 362,880 / (2 * 2 * 6) = 30,240\n\nNow, we need to consider the arrangement of the vowels within the group. There are 6 vowels (5 I's and 1 U). There are 6! ways to arrange these vowels. However, we need to account for the repetitions of the vowels (5 I's):\n\n6! / 5! = 720 / 120 = 6\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 9 units (30,240) by the number of ways to arrange the vowels within the group (6):\n\n30,240 * 6 = 181,440\n\nSo, there are 181,440 different ways to arrange the letters in the word \"INTUITIONISTIC\" with the vowels grouped together."
