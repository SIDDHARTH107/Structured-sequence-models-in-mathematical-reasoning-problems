    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2} and set B = {3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, then find the union of the resulting set. Next, find the Cartesian product of B and A, and find the union of that resulting set as well. Show that the union of the first resulting set is not equal to the union of the second resulting set, thus proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the resulting set. Since A x B is already a single set, the union of the resulting set is just A x B itself:\n\nUnion of A x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the resulting set. Since B x A is already a single set, the union of the resulting set is just B x A itself:\n\nUnion of B x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the union of A x B and the union of B x A:\n\nUnion of A x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nUnion of B x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the union of A x B is not equal to the union of B x A. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union."
