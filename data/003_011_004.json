    "message_1": "A house and a tower stand 500 meters apart. From the top of the tower, the angle of depression to the base of the house is 30 degrees. What is the height of the tower?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have the angle of depression (30 degrees) and the horizontal distance between the house and the tower (500 meters). We can form a right triangle with the tower's height as the opposite side, the horizontal distance as the adjacent side, and the angle of depression between them.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to find the height of the tower:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\n\ntan(30°) = height / 500\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight = 500 * tan(30°)\n\nWe know that tan(30°) = 1 / √3, so:\n\nheight = 500 * (1 / √3)\n\nheight ≈ 500 * 0.577\n\nheight ≈ 288.7 meters\n\nThe height of the tower is approximately 288.7 meters."
