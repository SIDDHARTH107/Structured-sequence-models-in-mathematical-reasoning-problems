    "message_1": "Suppose that you have a message of 1000 bits and a cryptographic hash function that produces an output of 256 bits. What is the maximum number of unique messages that can be generated by the hash function?",
    "message_2": "A cryptographic hash function that produces an output of 256 bits can generate a maximum of 2^256 unique hash values. This is because each bit can have 2 possible values (0 or 1), and there are 256 bits in the output. So, the maximum number of unique messages that can be generated by the hash function is 2^256."
