    "message_2": "To find the minimal resolution of singularities for the given algebraic curve, we first need to find the singular points of the curve. A singular point is a point where the partial derivatives of the curve with respect to x and y are both zero.\n\nGiven equation: $x^3 - y^3 - 3xy = 0$\n\nCompute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^3 - y^3 - 3xy) = 3x^2 - 3y = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^3 - y^3 - 3xy) = -3y^2 - 3x = 0$\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3y = 0$\n\n$-3y^2 - 3x = 0$\n\nDivide the first equation by 3:\n\n$x^2 - y = 0$\n\nDivide the second equation by -3:\n\n$y^2 + x = 0$\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n$x^2 - y = 0$\n\n$y^2 + x = 0$\n\nSolve the system of equations:\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $y = x^2$. Substitute this into the second equation:\n\n$(x^2)^2 + x = 0$\n\n$x^4 + x = 0$\n\nFactor out x:\n\n$x(x^3 + 1) = 0$\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions for x: $x = 0$ and $x^3 = -1$.\n\nCase 1: $x = 0$\n\nSubstitute this into the equation $y = x^2$:\n\n$y = (0)^2 = 0$\n\nSo, we have a singular point at $(0, 0)$.\n\nCase 2: $x^3 = -1$\n\nThis gives us $x = -1$. Substitute this into the equation $y = x^2$:\n\n$y = (-1)^2 = 1$\n\nSo, we have another singular point at $(-1, 1)$.\n\nNow, we have found the singular points of the curve: $(0, 0)$ and $(-1, 1)$. To find the minimal resolution of singularities, we need to blow up these points.\n\nBlow up at $(0, 0)$:\n\nIntroduce new coordinates $(u, v)$ such that $x = uv$ and $y = u^3v$. The equation of the curve in the new coordinates is:\n\n$(uv)^3 - (u^3v)^3 - 3(uv)(u^3v) = 0$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$u^3v^3 - u^9v^3 - 3u^4v^2 = 0$\n\nFactor out $u^3v^2$:\n\n$u^3v^2(1 - u^6 - 3u) = 0$\n\nThe exceptional divisor is given by $u^3v^2 = 0$. The strict transform of the curve is given by $1 - u^6 - 3u = 0$. The singular points of the strict transform are given by the solutions of the equation $1 - u^6 - 3u = 0$.\n\nBlow up at $(-1, 1)$:\n\nIntroduce new coordinates $(s, t)$ such that $x = -1 + s$ and $y = 1 + st$. The equation of the curve in the new coordinates is:\n\n$(-1 + s)^3 - (1 + st)^3 - 3(-1 + s)(1 + st) = 0$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$-1 + 3s - 3s^2 + s^3 - (1 + 3st + 3s^2t^2 + st^3) - 3(-1 + s)(1 + st) = 0$\n\n$-1 + 3s - 3s^2 + s^3 - 1 - 3st - 3s^2t^2 - st^3 + 3 - 3s - 3st + 3s^2t = 0$\n\n$-2 + 3s^2 - s^3 - 3st^3 = 0$\n\nThe exceptional divisor is given by $s = 0$ and $t = 0$. The strict transform of the curve is given by $-2 + 3s^2 - s^3 - 3st^3 = 0$. The singular points of the strict transform are given by the solutions of the equation $-2 + 3s^2 - s^3 - 3st^3 = 0$.\n\nThe minimal resolution of singularities for the given algebraic curve is obtained by blowing up the singular points $(0, 0)$ and $(-1, 1)$ and considering the strict transforms of the curve in the new coordinates."
