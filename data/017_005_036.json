    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 125\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, which is normal in G. Let P be this 5-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 5^3, by the Sylow theorems, P is a group of order 125. Thus, G is isomorphic to P, and P is a p-group (a group of prime power order). By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P is either a direct product of cyclic groups of prime order or a cyclic group itself. In this case, P is either a cyclic group of order 125 or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nNow, suppose n_5 = 25. Then there are 25 distinct 5-Sylow subgroups in G. Let P_1, P_2, ..., P_25 be these subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow subgroups is trivial, the total number of elements of order 5 in G is 25 * (5 - 1) = 100. This leaves 25 elements in G that are not of order 5. Since the identity element is one of these 25 elements, there are 24 elements in G that are not of order 5 and not the identity. Let H be the subgroup generated by these 24 elements and the identity. Then, H is a subgroup of G with order 25.\n\nSince H has order 25, it is a 5-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, H is either a cyclic group of order 25 or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. In either case, H is a normal subgroup of G, as it has index 5 in G, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G.\n\nNow, let K be any 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since K has order 5, it is a cyclic group. Also, K is a normal subgroup of G, as there is only one 5-Sylow subgroup in G/H. Thus, we have two normal subgroups H and K of G, with H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, by the internal direct product theorem. Since K is a cyclic group of order 5 and H is a group of order 25, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 125 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
