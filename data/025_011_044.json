    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Algebraic geometry and Abelian varieties:\n\nLet A be an Abelian variety that is not isomorphic to a product of elliptic curves. Show that A cannot be expressed as the quotient of a product of curves by a finite group action.\n\n(Note: This problem may require some background knowledge in Algebraic Geometry and Abelian varieties)",
    "message_2": "Suppose for contradiction that A can be expressed as the quotient of a product of curves by a finite group action. Let C_1 x C_2 be the product of curves, and G be the finite group acting on it. Then we have:\n\nA ≅ (C_1 x C_2) / G\n\nNow, consider the Albanese variety of C_1 x C_2, which is the dual of the Picard variety. The Albanese variety is an Abelian variety, and for a product of curves, it is isomorphic to the product of their Jacobians:\n\nAlb(C_1 x C_2) ≅ Jac(C_1) x Jac(C_2)\n\nSince G acts on C_1 x C_2, it also acts on the Albanese variety. Therefore, we can form the quotient:\n\nB = Alb(C_1 x C_2) / G\n\nBy the universal property of the Albanese variety, there exists a unique morphism f: A → B such that the following diagram commutes:\n\nC_1 x C_2 → Alb(C_1 x C_2)\n  ↓                ↓\nA → B\n\nHere, the vertical arrows are the quotient maps, and the top arrow is the Albanese map of C_1 x C_2.\n\nNow, we claim that f is an isomorphism. Indeed, f is surjective since the Albanese map is surjective. Moreover, f is injective because the kernel of f is a finite group (it is isomorphic to the kernel of the Albanese map composed with the quotient map, which is a finite group). Thus, f is an isomorphism.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA ≅ B ≅ Alb(C_1 x C_2) / G ≅ (Jac(C_1) x Jac(C_2)) / G\n\nSince the Jacobian of a curve is an elliptic curve, we have expressed A as a quotient of a product of elliptic curves by a finite group action. This contradicts the assumption that A is not isomorphic to a product of elliptic curves. Therefore, A cannot be expressed as the quotient of a product of curves by a finite group action."
