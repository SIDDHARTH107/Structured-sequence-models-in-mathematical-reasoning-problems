    "message_1": "Suppose you have a set of 5 different colors of hats and 3 different colors of gloves. In how many ways can you choose a set of 2 hats and 1 pair of gloves?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose a set of 2 hats and 1 pair of gloves, we can use the combination formula for choosing items from a set. \n\nFor the hats, we have 5 different colors, and we want to choose 2 of them. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items we want to choose.\n\nSo for the hats, we have C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 5! / (2!3!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)(3*2*1)) = 10 ways to choose 2 hats.\n\nFor the gloves, we have 3 different colors, and we want to choose 1 of them. Using the combination formula again, we have C(3, 1) = 3! / (1!(3-1)!) = 3! / (1!2!) = (3*2*1) / ((1)(2*1)) = 3 ways to choose 1 pair of gloves.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to choose a set of 2 hats and 1 pair of gloves, we simply multiply the number of ways to choose the hats by the number of ways to choose the gloves: 10 * 3 = 30 ways."
