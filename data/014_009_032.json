    "message_1": "Suppose you have a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and 16 rounds. The key size is also 64 bits. Each round uses a round key of size 48 bits. If the plaintext is \"011010000110010101101100011011000110111100100001\" (in binary), and the ciphertext is \"101001110110100000010011011110110110010101100111\", what is the value of the 4th round key used in the encryption process?",
    "message_2": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to directly determine the value of the 4th round key used in the encryption process without knowing the initial key or the specific Feistel function used in the cipher. The Feistel cipher is designed to be secure and resistant to attacks, so it would be extremely difficult to extract round keys without additional information.\n\nHowever, if you have the initial key or the specific Feistel function, you can perform the key scheduling process to generate the round keys and find the 4th round key."
