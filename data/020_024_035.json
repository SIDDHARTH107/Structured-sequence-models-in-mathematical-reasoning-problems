    "message_2": "To find the level of production that maximizes the company's profit, we first need to find the profit function P(x). The profit function is the difference between the revenue function R(x) and the cost function C(x).\n\nRevenue function R(x) is the product of the price per unit p(x) and the number of units x:\n\nR(x) = p(x) * x = (300 - 5x) * x = 300x - 5x^2\n\nNow, we can find the profit function P(x):\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (300x - 5x^2) - (1000 + 50x) = -5x^2 + 250x - 1000\n\nTo find the level of production that maximizes the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the derivative of P(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = -10x + 250\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n-10x + 250 = 0\n-10x = -250\nx = 25\n\nSo, the level of production that maximizes the company's profit is 25 units."
