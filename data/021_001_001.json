    "message_1": "Using Gaussian elimination, solve the following system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 6\n2x - 2y + 4z = -7\n-x + 1/2y -z = 0.5\n\nWhat are the values of x, y, and z that satisfy all three equations?",
    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the third equation to get rid of the fraction:\n\n-2x + y - 2z = 1\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1) 3x + 2y - z = 6\n2) 2x - 2y + 4z = -7\n3) -2x + y - 2z = 1\n\nNext, we'll use Gaussian elimination to solve the system. We'll start by eliminating x from equations 2 and 3. To do this, we'll multiply equation 1 by 2/3 and add it to equation 2, and multiply equation 1 by 2 and add it to equation 3:\n\n1) 3x + 2y - z = 6\n2) -4y + 10/3z = -25/3\n3) 0y + 0z = 5\n\nEquation 3 now says 0 = 5, which is a contradiction. This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution."
