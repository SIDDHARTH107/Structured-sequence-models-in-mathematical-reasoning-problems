They have collected the following data from the previous year:\n\n| Advertising Cost (x) | Sales (y) |\n|----------------------|-----------|\n| 500                  | 7500     |\n| 750                  | 9000     |\n| 1000                 | 10500    |\n| 1250                 | 12000    |\n| 1500                 | 13500    |\n\nUsing regression analysis, find the equation of the line that best fits the data and use it to predict the sales when the company spends $900 on advertising. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line that best fits the data, we will use the least squares method. First, we need to find the mean of x and y values:\n\nMean of x values (x̄) = (500 + 750 + 1000 + 1250 + 1500) / 5 = 4000 / 5 = 800\nMean of y values (ȳ) = (7500 + 9000 + 10500 + 12000 + 13500) / 5 = 52500 / 5 = 10500\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (b) of the line using the formula:\n\nb = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nCalculating the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator = (500 - 800)(7500 - 10500) + (750 - 800)(9000 - 10500) + (1000 - 800)(10500 - 10500) + (1250 - 800)(12000 - 10500) + (1500 - 800)(13500 - 10500)\nNumerator = (-300)(-3000) + (-50)(-1500) + (200)(0) + (450)(1500) + (700)(3000)\nNumerator = 900000 + 75000 + 0 + 675000 + 2100000\nNumerator = 3615000\n\nDenominator = (-300)^2 + (-50)^2 + (200)^2 + (450)^2 + (700)^2\nDenominator = 90000 + 2500 + 40000 + 202500 + 490000\nDenominator = 810000\n\nNow, we can find the slope (b):\n\nb = 3615000 / 810000 ≈ 4.46\n\nNext, we need to find the y-intercept (a) using the formula:\n\na = ȳ - b * x̄\n\na = 10500 - 4.46 * 800\na = 10500 - 3568 ≈ 6932\n\nSo, the equation of the line that best fits the data is:\n\ny = 4.46x + 6932\n\nNow, we can use this equation to predict the sales when the company spends $900 on advertising:\n\ny = 4.46 * 900 + 6932\ny = 4014 + 6932 ≈ 10946\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the predicted sales when the company spends $900 on advertising is approximately $10,946."
