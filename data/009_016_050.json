    "message_2": "To solve Laplace's equation for the electrostatic potential in a two-dimensional rectangular region, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let V(x, y) be the electrostatic potential in the region. Laplace's equation is given by:\n\n∇²V(x, y) = 0\n\nIn two dimensions, this becomes:\n\n(∂²V/∂x²) + (∂²V/∂y²) = 0\n\nWe assume a solution of the form V(x, y) = X(x)Y(y), and substitute this into the equation:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\n(X''(x)/X(x)) + (Y''(y)/Y(y)) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -k²:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -k²\nY''(y)/Y(y) = k²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + k²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) - k²Y(y) = 0\n\nWe can solve these equations using standard techniques. For the X equation, we have a sinusoidal solution:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx)\n\nFor the Y equation, we have an exponential solution:\n\nY(y) = C*cosh(ky) + D*sinh(ky)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions. At x = 0 and x = 6 cm, V(x, y) = 0:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 0\nX(6) = B*sin(6k) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we have:\n\nsin(6k) = 0\n\nThis implies that k = nπ/6, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, at y = 0 and y = 3 cm, V(x, y) = 0:\n\nY(0) = C*cosh(0) + D*sinh(0) = C = 0\nY(3) = D*sinh(3nπ/6) = 0\n\nSince D cannot be zero, we have:\n\nsinh(3nπ/6) = 0\n\nHowever, sinh(x) is never zero for nonzero x, so this boundary condition cannot be satisfied. This means that there is no solution to Laplace's equation with the given boundary conditions.\n\nHowever, if we change the problem slightly and assume that one of the shorter sides (y = 3 cm) is held at a constant potential of 10 V, and the remaining three sides are at zero potential, we can find a solution. In this case, the boundary conditions become:\n\nY(0) = D*sinh(0) = 0\nY(3) = D*sinh(3nπ/6) = 10\n\nNow, we can satisfy the boundary conditions. The general solution is given by:\n\nV(x, y) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/6) * sinh(nπy/6)]\n\nwhere the sum is over all integer values of n, and B_n are constants determined by the boundary conditions. To find B_n, we can use the boundary condition at y = 3 cm:\n\n10 = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/6) * sinh(nπ/2)]\n\nWe can determine the coefficients B_n using a Fourier sine series:\n\nB_n = (2/3) * ∫[10 * sin(nπx/6)] dx from 0 to 6\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nB_n = (20/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we have the complete solution for V(x, y):\n\nV(x, y) = (20/π) * Σ [(1 - (-1)^n)/n * sin(nπx/6) * sinh(nπy/6)]\n\nThis is the solution to Laplace's equation for the electrostatic potential in a two-dimensional rectangular region with length 6 cm and width 3 cm, where one of the shorter sides is held at a constant potential of 10 V and the remaining three sides are at zero potential."
