Suppose that f(z) is analytic in the open unit disk D = {z : |z|<1}. \n\n(a) Find the values of λ for which there is a unique analytic solution f(z) in D.\n\n(b) For λ = -1/4, find the unique analytic solution f(z) that satisfies f(0) = 1.",
    "message_2": "(a) To find the values of λ for which there is a unique analytic solution f(z) in D, we will use the Banach fixed-point theorem (also known as the contraction mapping theorem). We need to show that the operator T, defined by\n\n(Tf)(z) = 1 + 2z + λ∫₀¹ (z+t)f(t)dt,\n\nis a contraction on the space of analytic functions on D.\n\nLet f and g be two analytic functions on D. Then, we have\n\n|(Tf)(z) - (Tg)(z)| = |λ∫₀¹ (z+t)(f(t)-g(t))dt|.\n\nUsing the triangle inequality, we get\n\n|(Tf)(z) - (Tg)(z)| ≤ |λ|∫₀¹ |z+t||f(t)-g(t)|dt.\n\nSince f and g are analytic on D, they are continuous on the closed unit disk, and so is their difference. Thus, there exists a constant M such that |f(t)-g(t)| ≤ M for all t in [0,1]. Also, |z+t| ≤ |z|+|t| < 1+1 = 2 for all z in D and t in [0,1]. Therefore,\n\n|(Tf)(z) - (Tg)(z)| ≤ 2|λ|M∫₀¹ dt = 2|λ|M.\n\nNow, if 2|λ| < 1, then T is a contraction, and by the Banach fixed-point theorem, there exists a unique analytic solution f(z) in D. So, the values of λ for which there is a unique analytic solution f(z) in D are those with |λ| < 1/2.\n\n(b) For λ = -1/4, we will find the unique analytic solution f(z) that satisfies f(0) = 1. We have\n\nf(z) = 1 + 2z - (1/4)∫₀¹ (z+t)f(t)dt.\n\nLet's differentiate both sides with respect to z:\n\nf'(z) = 2 - (1/4)∫₀¹ f(t)dt.\n\nSince f(0) = 1, we can integrate both sides with respect to z from 0 to z:\n\n∫₀ᶻ f'(w)dw = ∫₀ᶻ (2 - (1/4)∫₀¹ f(t)dt)dw.\n\nThis gives us\n\nf(z) - f(0) = 2z - (1/4)z∫₀¹ f(t)dt.\n\nSince f(0) = 1, we have\n\nf(z) = 1 + 2z - (1/4)z∫₀¹ f(t)dt.\n\nNow, let's find the value of the integral ∫₀¹ f(t)dt. We know that f(t) = 1 + 2t - (1/4)t∫₀¹ f(u)du. So,\n\n∫₀¹ f(t)dt = ∫₀¹ (1 + 2t - (1/4)t∫₀¹ f(u)du)dt.\n\nLet I = ∫₀¹ f(t)dt. Then,\n\nI = ∫₀¹ dt + 2∫₀¹ tdt - (1/4)∫₀¹ tIdt = 1 + 1/2 - (1/4)I∫₀¹ tdt.\n\nThus, (3/4)I = 3/2, and I = 2.\n\nFinally, the unique analytic solution f(z) that satisfies f(0) = 1 is\n\nf(z) = 1 + 2z - (1/4)z(2) = 1 + 2z - (1/2)z = 1 + (3/2)z."
