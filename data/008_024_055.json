    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 4 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\n2(x + y - z) = 2(5) => 2x + 2y - 2z = 10\n(2x - y + 3z) - (2x + 2y - 2z) = 4 - 10 => -3y + 5z = -6 (1)\n\n4(x + y - z) = 4(5) => 4x + 4y - 4z = 20\n(4x - 3y + 5z) - (4x + 4y - 4z) = 11 - 20 => -7y + 9z = -9 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n-3y + 5z = -6 (1)\n-7y + 9z = -9 (2)\n\nWe can eliminate y from these equations by multiplying the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 3, and then adding the two equations:\n\n7(-3y + 5z) = 7(-6) => -21y + 35z = -42\n3(-7y + 9z) = 3(-9) => -21y + 27z = -27\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(-21y + 35z) + (-21y + 27z) = -42 + (-27)\n-42y + 62z = -69\n\nNow, divide both sides by -42:\n\ny - (62/42)z = 69/42\n\ny - (31/21)z = 23/14\n\nNow, we can see that there is a relationship between y and z, but we cannot find a unique solution for y and z. This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, depending on the value of z.\n\nTo find the value of x, we can substitute the expression for y in terms of z back into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n\nx + (y - (31/21)z) - z = 5\n\nx + (23/14) - (10/21)z = 5\n\nx = 5 - (23/14) + (10/21)z\n\nSo, the solution to this system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 5 - (23/14) + (10/21)z\ny = (23/14) + (31/21)z\nz = z\n\nWhere z can be any real number."
