    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the system, we need to find the poles and zeros of the transfer function H(s). The zeros are the roots of the numerator, and the poles are the roots of the denominator.\n\nFirst, let's find the zeros of H(s):\n\ns^2 + 2s + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = 2, and c = 5.\n\ns = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4*1*5)) / 2*1\ns = (-2 ± √(-16)) / 2\ns = -1 ± 2j\n\nSo the zeros of H(s) are -1 + 2j and -1 - 2j.\n\nNow let's find the poles of H(s):\n\ns^3 + 4s^2 + 5s + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the roots is more complex. We can use a numerical method or software to find the roots. Using a numerical method or software, we find the roots to be:\n\ns1 = -3.24698\ns2 = -0.37651 + 1.19694j\ns3 = -0.37651 - 1.19694j\n\nSo the poles of H(s) are -3.24698, -0.37651 + 1.19694j, and -0.37651 - 1.19694j.\n\nNow let's analyze the stability of the system. A system is stable if all the poles have negative real parts. In this case, all the poles have negative real parts:\n\nRe(s1) = -3.24698 < 0\nRe(s2) = -0.37651 < 0\nRe(s3) = -0.37651 < 0\n\nTherefore, the system is stable.\n\nIn summary, the zeros of the transfer function H(s) are -1 + 2j and -1 - 2j, and the poles are -3.24698, -0.37651 + 1.19694j, and -0.37651 - 1.19694j. The system is stable since all the poles have negative real parts."
