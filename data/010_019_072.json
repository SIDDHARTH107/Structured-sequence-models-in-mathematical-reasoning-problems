    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, we need to compute its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy$\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$\n\n$-6xy = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. If $x = 0$, then the first equation becomes $-3y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So one critical point is $(0, 0)$.\n\nIf $y = 0$, then the first equation becomes $3x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. This again gives the critical point $(0, 0)$, which we already found.\n\nSo the only critical point of $f$ is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNext, we need to compute the Hessian matrix of $f$ to determine the Morse index of the critical point:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x & -6y \\\\\n-6y & -6x\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAt the critical point $(0, 0)$, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$H(f)(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince the Hessian matrix is singular, we cannot determine the Morse index directly. However, we can consider the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix near the critical point. The eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are given by:\n\n$\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{2}(6x - 6x \\pm \\sqrt{(6x + 6x)^2 - 4(-6y)(6y)}) = \\pm 6y$\n\nSince the eigenvalues have different signs, the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a saddle point, and its Morse index is 1.\n\nNow let's compute the Morse homology of the level sets $f^{-1}(-2)$ and $f^{-1}(2)$. Since there is only one critical point with Morse index 1, the Morse homology groups are:\n\n$H_0(f^{-1}(-2)) = H_0(f^{-1}(2)) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the minimum)\n\n$H_1(f^{-1}(-2)) = H_1(f^{-1}(2)) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the saddle point)\n\n$H_2(f^{-1}(-2)) = H_2(f^{-1}(2)) = 0$ (no maximum)\n\nSo the Morse homology groups of the level sets $f^{-1}(-2)$ and $f^{-1}(2)$ are:\n\n$H_*(f^{-1}(-2)) = H_*(f^{-1}(2)) = (\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}, 0)$."
