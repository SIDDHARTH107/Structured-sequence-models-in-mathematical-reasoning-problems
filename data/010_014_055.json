Let X be the union of two non-empty open sets U and V such that U and V are contractible, U∩V is path-connected and not empty. Compute the second cohomology group H^2(X,ℤ) using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.",
    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group H^2(X, ℤ) using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, we first need to recall the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for cohomology:\n\nH^n(U ∩ V) → H^n(U) ⊕ H^n(V) → H^n(X) → H^(n+1)(U ∩ V) → H^(n+1)(U) ⊕ H^(n+1)(V)\n\nSince U and V are contractible, their cohomology groups are trivial except for H^0(U) = H^0(V) = ℤ. Additionally, since U ∩ V is path-connected, its cohomology groups are trivial except for H^0(U ∩ V) = ℤ. Now, we can write down the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for n = 1:\n\nH^1(U ∩ V) → H^1(U) ⊕ H^1(V) → H^1(X) → H^2(U ∩ V) → H^2(U) ⊕ H^2(V)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0 → 0 → H^1(X) → H^2(U ∩ V) → 0\n\nFrom this, we can see that H^1(X) is isomorphic to H^2(U ∩ V). Now, let's look at the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for n = 0:\n\nH^0(U ∩ V) → H^0(U) ⊕ H^0(V) → H^0(X) → H^1(U ∩ V) → H^1(U) ⊕ H^1(V)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nℤ → ℤ ⊕ ℤ → H^0(X) → 0 → 0\n\nThe map ℤ → ℤ ⊕ ℤ is given by x ↦ (x, x), and its image is the diagonal {(x, x) | x ∈ ℤ}. Thus, H^0(X) is isomorphic to (ℤ ⊕ ℤ) / {(x, x) | x ∈ ℤ} ≅ ℤ. Now, we can use the universal coefficient theorem to compute H^2(X, ℤ):\n\nH^2(X, ℤ) ≅ Hom(H_2(X, ℤ), ℤ) ⊕ Ext(H_1(X, ℤ), ℤ)\n\nSince H^1(X) ≅ H^2(U ∩ V) and H^0(X) ≅ ℤ, we have:\n\nH^2(X, ℤ) ≅ Hom(0, ℤ) ⊕ Ext(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ 0 ⊕ ℤ\n\nTherefore, the second cohomology group H^2(X, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ."
