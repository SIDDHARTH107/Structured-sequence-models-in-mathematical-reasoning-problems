    "message_2": "To show that the sequence {1/n} converges to 0 in the topological space X, we need to show that for any open set U containing 0, there exists a positive integer N such that for all n ≥ N, the terms 1/n belong to the open set U.\n\nLet U be an open set containing 0. Since U is open and X has the given basis, there exists a basis element [a, b) such that 0 ∈ [a, b) and [a, b) ⊆ U. Note that a < 0 < b.\n\nNow, we need to find an integer N such that for all n ≥ N, the terms 1/n belong to the open set U. Since 0 < b, we can use the Archimedean property of real numbers, which states that for any positive real number b, there exists a positive integer N such that 1/N < b.\n\nLet's choose such an integer N. Then, for all n ≥ N, we have:\n\n1/n ≤ 1/N < b\n\nSince a < 0, we also have:\n\na < 0 < 1/n\n\nCombining these inequalities, we get:\n\na < 1/n < b\n\nThis means that for all n ≥ N, the terms 1/n belong to the basis element [a, b), and since [a, b) ⊆ U, the terms 1/n also belong to the open set U.\n\nTherefore, the sequence {1/n} converges to 0 in the topological space X."
