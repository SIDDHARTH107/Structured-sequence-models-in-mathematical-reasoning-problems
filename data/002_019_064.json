    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 8 cm and a slant height of 12 cm. What is its surface area, in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of its base and the area of its lateral surface. The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = Base Area + Lateral Surface Area\n\n1. Base Area: The base of the cone is a circle with a radius of 8 cm. The formula for the area of a circle is:\n\nBase Area = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius.\n\nBase Area = π * (8 cm)^2 = 64π square centimeters\n\n2. Lateral Surface Area: The lateral surface of the cone is the curved part that connects the base to the apex. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is:\n\nLateral Surface Area = π * r * l\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nLateral Surface Area = π * (8 cm) * (12 cm) = 96π square centimeters\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area by adding the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nSurface Area = Base Area + Lateral Surface Area\nSurface Area = 64π + 96π = 160π square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is 160π square centimeters."
