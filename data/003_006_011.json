    "message_1": "In triangle ABC, angle A measures 35 degrees, angle B measures 65 degrees, and the length of side b is 8 units. Find the length of sides a and c using the law of sines.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\nangle C = 180 - angle A - angle B\nangle C = 180 - 35 - 65\nangle C = 80 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the law of sines to find the lengths of sides a and c. The law of sines states that:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe are given side b and angles A, B, and C. We can find side a using the formula:\n\na = b * sin(A) / sin(B)\na = 8 * sin(35) / sin(65)\n\na ≈ 5.29 units (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find side c using the formula:\n\nc = b * sin(C) / sin(B)\nc = 8 * sin(80) / sin(65)\n\nc ≈ 9.04 units (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the lengths of sides a and c are approximately 5.29 units and 9.04 units, respectively."
