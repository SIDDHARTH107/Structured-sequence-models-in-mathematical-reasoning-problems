    "message_1": "A metal ring has a radius of 5 cm and a cross-section diameter of 3 cm. Find the volume of the torus formed by revolving this ring around the central axis.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the cross-section (the radius of the ring), and r is the radius of the cross-section.\n\nGiven that the radius of the ring (R) is 5 cm and the diameter of the cross-section is 3 cm, we can find the radius of the cross-section (r) by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nr = 3 cm / 2 = 1.5 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values of R and r into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 5 cm * (1.5 cm)^2\nVolume ≈ 2 * (3.1416)^2 * 5 * 2.25\nVolume ≈ 2 * 9.8696 * 5 * 2.25\nVolume ≈ 19.7392 * 11.25\nVolume ≈ 222.066\n\nTherefore, the volume of the torus is approximately 222.066 cubic centimeters."
