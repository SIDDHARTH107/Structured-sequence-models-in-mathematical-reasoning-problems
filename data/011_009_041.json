    "message_2": "To partition a set of 6 elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number, which is a sequence of numbers that count the number of ways to partition a set with n elements. The Bell number B(n) can be calculated using the Bell triangle or other methods.\n\nFor a set of 6 elements, the Bell number B(6) is 203. Therefore, there are 203 ways to partition a set of 6 elements into non-empty subsets."
