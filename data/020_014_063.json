    "message_1": "A machine has two parts, A and B, with a production cost of $10 and $15 respectively. To produce a certain product, part A requires 2 hours of labor, while part B requires 3 hours. The total labor hours available per day for the product are limited to 360 hours. If the selling price of the product is $100, determine the optimal number of parts A and B to produce in order to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of part A produced and y be the number of part B produced.\n\nThe labor constraint can be represented as:\n2x + 3y ≤ 360\n\nThe profit for each part A produced is $100 - $10 = $90, and the profit for each part B produced is $100 - $15 = $85. The total profit can be represented as:\nP = 90x + 85y\n\nWe want to maximize the profit P, subject to the labor constraint.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequality for y:\ny ≤ (360 - 2x) / 3\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative integers (you can't produce a negative or fractional number of parts), we will look for the integer values of x and y that satisfy the inequality and maximize the profit.\n\nWe can start by finding the maximum value of x when y = 0:\n0 ≤ (360 - 2x) / 3\n0 ≤ 360 - 2x\n2x ≤ 360\nx ≤ 180\n\nSo, the maximum value of x is 180 when y = 0. Now, we will find the maximum value of y when x = 0:\ny ≤ (360 - 2*0) / 3\ny ≤ 360 / 3\ny ≤ 120\n\nSo, the maximum value of y is 120 when x = 0.\n\nNow, we will check the integer values of x and y that satisfy the inequality and maximize the profit. We can start by checking the corner points of the feasible region: (0, 0), (0, 120), (180, 0), and any other points where the labor constraint is met with equality.\n\n1. (0, 0): P = 90(0) + 85(0) = $0\n2. (0, 120): P = 90(0) + 85(120) = $10,200\n3. (180, 0): P = 90(180) + 85(0) = $16,200\n\nNow, we need to find the point where the labor constraint is met with equality:\n2x + 3y = 360\n\nWe can try different integer values of x and y to find the point that satisfies the equality and maximizes the profit. One such point is (60, 80):\n2(60) + 3(80) = 120 + 240 = 360\n\nThe profit at this point is:\nP = 90(60) + 85(80) = $10,800\n\nComparing the profits at the corner points and the point where the labor constraint is met with equality, we find that the maximum profit is achieved when producing 60 parts A and 80 parts B, with a total profit of $10,800."
