Find the intersection multiplicity of $V$ with the variety $W \\subset \\mathbb{A}^4$ given by the equation $xy - zw = 0$ at the point $(1, 0, 0, 1)$, i.e., compute the intersection number $I((V, (1,0,0,1)), (W, (1,0,0,1)))$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the intersection multiplicity, we will work in the local ring at the point $(1, 0, 0, 1)$. Let's consider the local ring $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^4, (1,0,0,1)}$ and its maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m} = (x-1, y, z, w-1)$. We will work with the ideals generated by the defining equations of $V$ and $W$ in this local ring.\n\nLet $I_V = (x^2 + y^2 - 1, z^2 + w^2 - 1)$ and $I_W = (xy - zw)$. We want to compute the intersection multiplicity $I((V, (1,0,0,1)), (W, (1,0,0,1))) = \\dim_{\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^4, (1,0,0,1)} / \\mathfrak{m}} (\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^4, (1,0,0,1)} / (I_V + I_W))$.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the generators of $I_V$ using the maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$. We have:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 - 1 = (x-1+1)^2 + y^2 - 1 = (x-1)^2 + 2(x-1) + y^2 \\equiv 2(x-1) + y^2 \\pmod{\\mathfrak{m}^2}$.\n\n$z^2 + w^2 - 1 = z^2 + (w-1+1)^2 - 1 = z^2 + (w-1)^2 + 2(w-1) \\equiv z^2 + 2(w-1) \\pmod{\\mathfrak{m}^2}$.\n\nSo, in $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^4, (1,0,0,1)} / \\mathfrak{m}^2$, we have $I_V = (2(x-1) + y^2, z^2 + 2(w-1))$.\n\nNow, let's compute the sum of the ideals $I_V + I_W$. Since $I_W$ has only one generator, we just need to add it to the generators of $I_V$:\n\n$I_V + I_W = (2(x-1) + y^2 + xy - zw, z^2 + 2(w-1) + xy - zw)$.\n\nNow, we compute the quotient of the local ring by this ideal:\n\n$\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^4, (1,0,0,1)} / (I_V + I_W) = \\frac{\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^4, (1,0,0,1)}}{(2(x-1) + y^2 + xy - zw, z^2 + 2(w-1) + xy - zw)}$.\n\nTo compute the dimension of this quotient as a vector space over $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{A}^4, (1,0,0,1)} / \\mathfrak{m}$, we can look for a basis. We claim that a basis is given by the monomials $1, x-1, y, z, w-1$. Indeed, any higher degree monomial will be divisible by one of the generators of the ideal, and thus will be zero in the quotient.\n\nTherefore, the intersection multiplicity is given by the dimension of this vector space, which is $5$. So, $I((V, (1,0,0,1)), (W, (1,0,0,1))) = 5$."
