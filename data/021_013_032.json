    "message_1": "An oil refinery has two crude oil sources, A and B. The refinery can process at most 100 barrels of crude oil per day. Crude oil from source A has a sulfur content of 0.25% and a cost of $50 per barrel, while crude oil from source B has a sulfur content of 0.5% and a cost of $40 per barrel. \n\nThe refinery wants to minimize the sulfur content of the crude oil it uses while staying within the daily processing limit and the budget. Write a program using simulated annealing to determine the optimal combination of crude oil from sources A and B that will minimize the sulfur content.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using simulated annealing, we will first define the objective function, the cooling schedule, and the neighbor function. Then, we will implement the simulated annealing algorithm.\n\nObjective function: The objective function calculates the total sulfur content of the crude oil mixture. It takes the number of barrels from source A and source B as input and returns the total sulfur content.\n\nCooling schedule: The cooling schedule determines how the temperature decreases over time. We will use a simple exponential decay function.\n\nNeighbor function: The neighbor function generates a new solution by slightly modifying the current solution. In this case, we will randomly change the number of barrels from source A and source B.\n\nHere's the Python code for the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef objective_function(a, b):\n    return 0.0025 * a + 0.005 * b\n\ndef cooling_schedule(t):\n    return 0.99 * t\n\ndef neighbor(a, b, budget):\n    new_a = a + random.randint(-1, 1)\n    new_b = b + random.randint(-1, 1)\n    \n    if new_a < 0 or new_b < 0 or new_a + new_b > 100 or 50 * new_a + 40 * new_b > budget:\n        return a, b\n    return new_a, new_b\n\ndef simulated_annealing(budget):\n    a, b = random.randint(0, budget // 50), random.randint(0, budget // 40)\n    temperature = 1000\n    min_temperature = 0.01\n    best_a, best_b = a, b\n    best_sulfur = objective_function(a, b)\n\n    while temperature > min_temperature:\n        new_a, new_b = neighbor(a, b, budget)\n        new_sulfur = objective_function(new_a, new_b)\n        delta_sulfur = new_sulfur - objective_function(a, b)\n\n        if delta_sulfur < 0 or random.random() < math.exp(-delta_sulfur / temperature):\n            a, b = new_a, new_b\n\n            if new_sulfur < best_sulfur:\n                best_a, best_b = a, b\n                best_sulfur = new_sulfur\n\n        temperature = cooling_schedule(temperature)\n\n    return best_a, best_b, best_sulfur\n\nbudget = 4000  # Example budget\nbest_a, best_b, best_sulfur = simulated_annealing(budget)\nprint(f\"Optimal combination: {best_a} barrels from source A, {best_b} barrels from source B\")\nprint(f\"Minimum sulfur content: {best_sulfur}\")\n```\n\nThis code defines the objective function, cooling schedule, and neighbor function, and then implements the simulated annealing algorithm. The algorithm starts with a random initial solution and iteratively improves it by exploring the solution space. The temperature parameter controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off. As the temperature decreases, the algorithm becomes less likely to accept worse solutions, eventually converging to a near-optimal solution."
