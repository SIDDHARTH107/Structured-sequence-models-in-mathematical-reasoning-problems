    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 135909781 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function, f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N, where N is the number we want to factor (135909781 in this case).\n2. Choose two initial values, x = 2 and y = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for both x and y, updating their values as follows:\n   x = f(x)\n   y = f(f(y))\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and N.\n5. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is equal to N, the algorithm has failed. If the GCD is between 1 and N, we have found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 135909781\n2. x = 2, y = 2\n\nIterate and calculate GCD:\n\n3. x = f(2) = 5, y = f(f(2)) = f(5) = 26\n4. GCD(|5 - 26|, 135909781) = GCD(21, 135909781) = 1\n\n3. x = f(5) = 26, y = f(f(26)) = f(677) = 135909781 - 677 = 135909104\n4. GCD(|26 - 135909104|, 135909781) = GCD(135909078, 135909781) = 3\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, 3. Since 3 is a prime number, it is the smallest prime factor of 135909781."
