    "message_2": "To find the length of the other leg, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two legs (a and b). In equation form, this is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 13 cm) and one leg (a = 5 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b). Plugging the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n13^2 = 5^2 + b^2\n169 = 25 + b^2\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\n169 - 25 = b^2\n144 = b^2\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nsqrt(144) = sqrt(b^2)\n12 = b\n\nSo, the length of the other leg (b) is 12 cm."
