Determine the number of possible partitions for each prime factor's exponent: \n   - For 2^5, the possible partitions are (5), (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1, 1), (2, 2, 1), and (2, 1, 1, 1).\n   - For 3^1, the possible partition is (1).\n3. Calculate the number of groups for each partition using the formula: \n   G(n) = (p^(n-1) * (p-1)) / n\n   where G(n) is the number of groups for the partition, p is the prime factor, and n is the exponent in the partition.\n4. Multiply the number of groups for each partition of the prime factors and sum the results.\n\nLet's calculate the number of groups for each partition of 2^5:\n\n- (5): G(5) = (2^(5-1) * (2-1)) / 5 = (16 * 1) / 5 = 3.2 (round down to 3)\n- (4, 1): G(4) * G(1) = (2^(4-1) * (2-1)) / 4 * (2^(1-1) * (2-1)) / 1 = (8 * 1) / 4 * (1 * 1) / 1 = 2 * 1 = 2\n- (3, 2): G(3) * G(2) = (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) / 3 * (2^(2-1) * (2-1)) / 2 = (4 * 1) / 3 * (2 * 1) / 2 = 1.333 (round down to 1) * 1 = 1\n- (3, 1, 1): G(3) * G(1)^2 = (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) / 3 * (2^(1-1) * (2-1)) / 1^2 = (4 * 1) / 3 * (1 * 1) / 1^2 = 1.333 (round down to 1) * 1 = 1\n- (2, 2, 1): G(2)^2 * G(1) = (2^(2-1) * (2-1)) / 2^2 * (2^(1-1) * (2-1)) / 1 = (2 * 1) / 2^2 * (1 * 1) / 1 = 1 * 1 = 1\n- (2, 1, 1, 1): G(2) * G(1)^3 = (2^(2-1) * (2-1)) / 2 * (2^(1-1) * (2-1)) / 1^3 = (2 * 1) / 2 * (1 * 1) / 1^3 = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of groups for the partition of 3^1:\n\n- (1): G(1) = (3^(1-1) * (3-1)) / 1 = (1 * 2) / 1 = 2\n\nFinally, multiply the number of groups for each partition of the prime factors and sum the results:\n\n- 3 * 2 = 6\n- 2 * 2 = 4\n- 1 * 2 = 2\n- 1 * 2 = 2\n- 1 * 2 = 2\n- 1 * 2 = 2\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96 is 6 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18."
