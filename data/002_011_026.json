    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg measuring 7 units and the hypotenuse measuring 13 units. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the other leg be x units. Since it is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n7^2 + x^2 = 13^2\n\n49 + x^2 = 169\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 169 - 49\nx^2 = 120\n\nx = √120\nx ≈ 10.95\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is approximately 10.95 units."
