    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to design a rectangular box with a volume of 600 cubic centimeters. The length of the box must be twice the width, and the height must be three times the width. The cost of making the top and bottom parts of the box is 2 cents per square centimeter, while the cost of making the sides is 1 cent per square centimeter. Find the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of materials. How much will it cost to make the box with these dimensions?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the width of the box. Then the length is 2x, and the height is 3x. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x * 2x * 3x = 6x^3\n\nWe are given that the volume is 600 cubic centimeters, so:\n\n600 = 6x^3\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n100 = x^3\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 100^(1/3) ≈ 4.64 cm\n\nNow we have the width, we can find the length and height:\n\nLength = 2x ≈ 2 * 4.64 ≈ 9.28 cm\nHeight = 3x ≈ 3 * 4.64 ≈ 13.92 cm\n\nNow we need to find the cost of making the box. The top and bottom parts have a combined area of 2 * (length * width) and the sides have a combined area of 2 * (length * height + width * height):\n\nTop and bottom area = 2 * (9.28 * 4.64) ≈ 86.07 cm^2\nSides area = 2 * (9.28 * 13.92 + 4.64 * 13.92) ≈ 255.98 cm^2\n\nThe cost of making the top and bottom is 2 cents per square centimeter, and the cost of making the sides is 1 cent per square centimeter:\n\nTop and bottom cost = 86.07 * 2 = 172.14 cents\nSides cost = 255.98 * 1 = 255.98 cents\n\nTotal cost = 172.14 + 255.98 = 428.12 cents\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of materials are approximately 4.64 cm x 9.28 cm x 13.92 cm, and the cost to make the box with these dimensions is approximately 428.12 cents, or $4.28."
