If we want to find an optimal control function u(t) that minimizes the cost function: J(u) = ∫(t=0 to t=1) [y^2(t) + u^2(t)] dt, where y(t) is the output function, what is the optimal control function u(t) that minimizes the cost function J(u)?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control function u(t) that minimizes the cost function J(u), we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we need to form the Hamiltonian function H, which is given by:\n\nH = y^2(t) + u^2(t) + λ(t)[y''(t) + 2y'(t) + y(t) - 4u(t)],\n\nwhere λ(t) is the costate variable.\n\nNow, we need to find the necessary conditions for optimality. These conditions are given by:\n\n1. ∂H/∂u = 0\n2. λ'(t) = -∂H/∂y\n3. λ(1) = 0\n\nDifferentiating H with respect to u, we get:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u(t) - 4λ(t).\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we obtain:\n\n2u(t) - 4λ(t) = 0.\n\nSolving for u(t), we get:\n\nu(t) = 2λ(t).\n\nNow, differentiating H with respect to y, we get:\n\n∂H/∂y = 2y(t) + λ(t).\n\nUsing the second condition, we have:\n\nλ'(t) = -2y(t) - λ(t).\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation for λ(t). To solve it, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\nμ(t) = e^(∫-1 dt) = e^(-t).\n\nMultiplying the differential equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n\ne^(-t)λ'(t) + e^(-t)λ(t) = -2e^(-t)y(t).\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product λ(t)e^(-t). So, we can write:\n\nd(λ(t)e^(-t))/dt = -2e^(-t)y(t).\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to t, we get:\n\nλ(t)e^(-t) = -2∫e^(-t)y(t) dt + C,\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, using the third condition λ(1) = 0, we can find the value of C:\n\n0 = -2∫(t=0 to t=1) e^(-t)y(t) dt + C*e^(-1).\n\nSolving for C, we get:\n\nC = 2∫(t=0 to t=1) e^(-t)y(t) dt * e.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for λ(t):\n\nλ(t) = -2e^(t)∫(t=0 to t=τ) e^(-τ)y(τ) dτ + 2e^(t-1)∫(t=0 to t=1) e^(-τ)y(τ) dτ.\n\nSubstituting the expression for λ(t) into the expression for u(t), we get:\n\nu(t) = -4e^(t)∫(t=0 to t=τ) e^(-τ)y(τ) dτ + 4e^(t-1)∫(t=0 to t=1) e^(-τ)y(τ) dτ.\n\nThis is the optimal control function u(t) that minimizes the cost function J(u). However, to find the explicit form of u(t), we need to solve the given differential equation for y(t) and substitute it into the expression for u(t)."
