    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm of 5 to the base 3 modulo 11, we need to find an integer x such that:\n\n3^x ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nWe can do this by trying different values of x and checking if the equation holds true:\n\nx = 1: 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\nx = 2: 3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\nx = 3: 3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nSo, the discrete logarithm of 5 to the base 3 modulo 11 is x = 3."
