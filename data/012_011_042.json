    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph, assigning a discovery time to each vertex.\n2. For each vertex v, find the lowest discovery time reachable from v, considering all its adjacent vertices except its parent in the DFS tree. This is called the low value of v.\n3. A vertex v is a cut vertex if:\n   a. It is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children.\n   b. It is not the root, and there is a child w such that no vertex in the subtree rooted at w has a low value less than or equal to the discovery time of v.\n4. An edge (v, w) is a bridge if the low value of w is greater than the discovery time of v.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given graph, we get the following results:\n\n1. DFS traversal (with discovery times): A(1) -> B(2) -> C(3) -> D(4) -> E(5) -> F(6) -> G(7) -> H(8)\n2. Low values: A(1), B(1), C(1), D(1), E(5), F(6), G(7), H(8)\n\nNow, we can identify the cut vertices and bridges:\n\nCut vertices:\n- Vertex A: It is the root of the DFS tree and has two children (B and D).\n- Vertex D: It is not the root, and its child E has a low value (5) greater than the discovery time of D (4).\n\nBridges:\n- Edge (D, E): The low value of E (5) is greater than the discovery time of D (4).\n- Edge (E, F): The low value of F (6) is greater than the discovery time of E (5).\n- Edge (F, G): The low value of G (7) is greater than the discovery time of F (6).\n- Edge (G, H): The low value of H (8) is greater than the discovery time of G (7).\n\nSo, the cut vertices are A and D, and the bridges are edges (D, E), (E, F), (F, G), and (G, H)."
