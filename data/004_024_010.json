    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx, we will first differentiate the given equation with respect to x using the chain rule. \n\nGiven equation: x^2 - xy + y^2 = 9\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd(x^2)/dx - d(xy)/dx + d(y^2)/dx = d(9)/dx\n\nUsing the chain rule:\n\n2x - (x * dy/dx + y) + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we will solve for dy/dx:\n\n2x - y + x(dy/dx) + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx (x + 2y) = y - 2x\n\nNow, divide both sides by (x + 2y):\n\ndy/dx = (y - 2x) / (x + 2y)\n\nNow, we will substitute the given values of x = 2 and y = 1:\n\ndy/dx = (1 - 2(2)) / (2 + 2(1))\n\ndy/dx = (-3) / (6)\n\ndy/dx = -1/2\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx when x = 2 and y = 1 is -1/2."
