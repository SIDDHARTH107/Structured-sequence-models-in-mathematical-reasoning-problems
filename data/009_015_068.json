    "message_1": "Consider a sample of a radioactive isotope containing 200 grams which has a half-life of 10 years. How much of the isotope will remain after 30 years have passed?",
    "message_2": "To determine the remaining amount of the radioactive isotope after 30 years, we can use the formula:\n\nRemaining amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 200 grams, the half-life is 10 years, and the time elapsed is 30 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nRemaining amount = 200 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nRemaining amount = 200 * (1/2)^3\n\nRemaining amount = 200 * (1/8)\n\nRemaining amount = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 30 years, 25 grams of the radioactive isotope will remain."
