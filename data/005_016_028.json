    "message_1": "In a study of 100 students who took a math class and a language class, the mean final math score was 82 and the mean final language score was 75. The covariance between the math and language scores was 30. If a new student took both classes and scored 90 on the math final, what is their predicted score on the language final using discriminant analysis?",
    "message_2": "To predict the language score using discriminant analysis, we need to find the regression equation. The regression equation can be found using the formula:\n\nY = a + bX\n\nwhere Y is the predicted language score, X is the math score, a is the intercept, and b is the slope. To find the slope (b), we need to use the formula:\n\nb = Cov(X, Y) / Var(X)\n\nWe are given the covariance between math and language scores (Cov(X, Y)) as 30. To find the variance of math scores (Var(X)), we need more information. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the variance of math scores and thus cannot find the slope (b) and the intercept (a) to predict the language score using discriminant analysis."
