    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total curvature of a closed surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface. For a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2.\n\nSo, the total curvature K of the sphere is:\n\nK = 2πχ\n\nSince χ = 2 for a sphere, we have:\n\nK = 2π(2)\n\nK = 4π\n\nTherefore, the total curvature of the sphere with radius 2 units is 4π."
