    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, which is given by the partial derivatives of the functions with respect to x and y:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nwhere f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 and f2(x, y) = x^3 - y.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = 2y\n∂f2/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f2/∂y = -1\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = |  2x   2y  |\n          | 3x^2  -1  |\n\nNow, we need to apply the Newton's method iteratively until the maximum error is less than 0.01. The iteration formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x_new, y_new) = (x_old, y_old) - J(x_old, y_old)^(-1) * F(x_old, y_old)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the vector of the functions [f1(x, y), f2(x, y)].\n\nLet's choose an initial guess (x0, y0) = (1, 0) and start iterating:\n\n1. Compute F(x0, y0) = [x0^2 + y0^2 - 1, x0^3 - y0] = [0, 1]\n2. Compute J(x0, y0) = | 2x0  2y0  | = |  2  0  |\n                       | 3x0^2 -1  |   |  3 -1  |\n3. Compute J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0) = |  2  0  |^(-1) * | 0 | = | 1/2  0  | * | 0 | = | 0 |\n                                      |  3 -1  |         | 1 |   | 3/2 -1/2 |   | 1 |   | 1/2 |\n4. Update (x0, y0) = (x0, y0) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0) = (1, 0) - (0, 1/2) = (1, -1/2)\n\nNow, we need to check the maximum error:\n\nmax_error = max(abs(F(x_new, y_new))) = max(abs([1 - 1/4 - 1, 1 - 1/8])) = max(abs([-1/4, 7/8]))\n\nSince the max_error = 7/8 > 0.01, we need to continue iterating with the new values (x1, y1) = (1, -1/2). Repeat the steps 1-4 until the max_error < 0.01.\n\nAfter several iterations, we get the approximate solution (x, y) ≈ (0.925, -0.382) with a maximum error less than 0.01. Note that this is only one of the possible solutions, and the convergence of Newton's method depends on the initial guess."
