Assume that the solution Ψ(x) is bounded as x → ±∞, which implies that Ψ(x) can be written as \n\nΨ(x) = A * e^(ikx) + B * e^(-ikx)\n\nwhere A and B are complex constants. \n\nIf Ψ(0) = 1 and Ψ'(0) = i, determine the values of A and B.",
    "message_2": "To find the values of A and B, we will use the given conditions Ψ(0) = 1 and Ψ'(0) = i.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of Ψ(x) with respect to x:\n\nΨ'(x) = d/dx (A * e^(ikx) + B * e^(-ikx))\nΨ'(x) = A * (ik) * e^(ikx) - B * (ik) * e^(-ikx)\n\nNow, let's use the given conditions:\n\n1. Ψ(0) = 1:\n1 = A * e^(0) + B * e^(0)\n1 = A + B\n\n2. Ψ'(0) = i:\ni = A * (ik) * e^(0) - B * (ik) * e^(0)\ni = ik(A - B)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, A and B:\n\n1 = A + B\ni = ik(A - B)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express B in terms of A:\n\nB = 1 - A\n\nNow substitute this expression for B into the second equation:\n\ni = ik(A - (1 - A))\ni = ik(2A - 1)\n\nNow, divide both sides by ik:\n\ni/ik = 2A - 1\n1/k = 2A - 1\n\nNow, solve for A:\n\n2A = 1 + 1/k\nA = (1 + 1/k) / 2\n\nNow, substitute the expression for A back into the expression for B:\n\nB = 1 - ((1 + 1/k) / 2)\nB = (1 - 1/k) / 2\n\nSo, the values of A and B are:\n\nA = (1 + 1/k) / 2\nB = (1 - 1/k) / 2"
