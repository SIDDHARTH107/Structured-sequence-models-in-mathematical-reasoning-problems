    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5sin(2x) + 2cos(3x), we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [5sin(2x) + 2cos(3x)]\n\nFor the first term, the outer function is 5sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of the outer function is 5cos(u) and the derivative of the inner function is 2. Using the chain rule, we have:\n\nd/dx [5sin(2x)] = 5cos(2x) * 2 = 10cos(2x)\n\nFor the second term, the outer function is 2cos(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. The derivative of the outer function is -2sin(u) and the derivative of the inner function is 3. Using the chain rule, we have:\n\nd/dx [2cos(3x)] = -2sin(3x) * 3 = -6sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can combine the derivatives of the two terms:\n\nf'(x) = 10cos(2x) - 6sin(3x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = pi/4:\n\nf'(pi/4) = 10cos(2(pi/4)) - 6sin(3(pi/4))\n\nf'(pi/4) = 10cos(pi/2) - 6sin(3pi/4)\n\ncos(pi/2) = 0 and sin(3pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, so:\n\nf'(pi/4) = 10(0) - 6(sqrt(2)/2)\n\nf'(pi/4) = -3sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 5sin(2x) + 2cos(3x) at x = pi/4 is -3sqrt(2)."
