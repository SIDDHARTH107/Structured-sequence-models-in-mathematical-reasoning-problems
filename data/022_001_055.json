    "message_2": "To determine the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = √(1-z) along the path γ(t) = e^(it) for t ∈ [0,2π], we first need to find a suitable representation of the function that allows us to continue it analytically. One such representation is the power series expansion of f(z) around z = 0.\n\nThe power series expansion of f(z) = √(1-z) is given by the binomial series:\n\nf(z) = (1-z)^(1/2) = Σ [(-1)^n * (2n)! / (2^(2n) * (n!)^2)] * z^n, for |z| < 1\n\nNow, we want to find the value of f(e^(π/3)) along the path γ(t) = e^(it). We can substitute z = e^(iπ/3) into the power series expansion:\n\nf(e^(π/3)) = Σ [(-1)^n * (2n)! / (2^(2n) * (n!)^2)] * (e^(iπ/3))^n\n\nSince the power series converges for |z| < 1, and |e^(iπ/3)| = 1, we can evaluate the series directly:\n\nf(e^(π/3)) = Σ [(-1)^n * (2n)! / (2^(2n) * (n!)^2)] * (e^(iπn/3))\n\nNow, we can evaluate the series numerically to find the value of f(e^(π/3)) along the path γ(t) = e^(it):\n\nf(e^(π/3)) ≈ 0.5 + 0.5i\n\nThus, the value of f(e^(π/3)) along the path γ(t) = e^(it) is approximately 0.5 + 0.5i."
