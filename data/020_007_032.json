    "message_1": "A warehouse manager needs to organize a set of 50 boxes in the most efficient way possible. Each box has dimensions (length, width, height) given by (20cm, 30cm, 40cm) and weighs 10kg. The warehouse has shelves with dimensions (length, width, height) given by (2m, 2m, 2.5m). What is the maximum number of boxes that can be stored in one shelf, assuming that all boxes must be placed in the same orientation and touching each other, and without exceeding a maximum weight limit of 500kg per shelf?",
    "message_2": "First, let's convert the dimensions of the shelves to centimeters to match the dimensions of the boxes:\n\nShelf dimensions: (200cm, 200cm, 250cm)\n\nNow, let's find out how many boxes can fit in each dimension of the shelf:\n\nLength: 200cm / 20cm = 10 boxes\nWidth: 200cm / 30cm = 6.67 boxes (round down to 6 boxes)\nHeight: 250cm / 40cm = 6.25 boxes (round down to 6 boxes)\n\nSo, we can fit 10 boxes along the length, 6 boxes along the width, and 6 boxes along the height. To find the total number of boxes that can fit on the shelf, multiply these numbers together:\n\n10 boxes * 6 boxes * 6 boxes = 360 boxes\n\nNow, let's check the weight limit. Each box weighs 10kg, and the maximum weight limit per shelf is 500kg. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be stored without exceeding the weight limit, divide the weight limit by the weight of each box:\n\n500kg / 10kg = 50 boxes\n\nSince the weight limit allows for 50 boxes, but the shelf can physically fit 360 boxes, the maximum number of boxes that can be stored in one shelf is limited by the weight constraint, which is 50 boxes."
