    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we first need to identify the number of vertices, edges, connected components, and cycles. The graph has 6 vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F), 7 edges (AB, BC, AD, DE, CF, AE, BE), 1 connected component, and 1 cycle (ABED).\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T(x, y) is defined as:\n\nT(x, y) = x^(k(A) - k(G)) * (y - 1)^(|A| - k(A))\n\nwhere G is the graph, A is a subset of the edges of G, k(G) is the number of connected components of G, and k(A) is the number of connected components of the subgraph induced by A.\n\nFor the given graph, we have k(G) = 1 and |A| = 7. We will now compute the Tutte polynomial by considering all possible subsets of the edges and their corresponding connected components.\n\n1. A = {}: k(A) = 6, T(x, y) = x^(6-1) * (y-1)^(7-6) = x^5 * (y-1)\n2. A = {AB}: k(A) = 5, T(x, y) = x^(5-1) * (y-1)^(7-5) = x^4 * (y-1)^2\n3. A = {AB, BC}: k(A) = 4, T(x, y) = x^(4-1) * (y-1)^(7-4) = x^3 * (y-1)^3\n4. A = {AB, BC, AD}: k(A) = 3, T(x, y) = x^(3-1) * (y-1)^(7-3) = x^2 * (y-1)^4\n5. A = {AB, BC, AD, DE}: k(A) = 2, T(x, y) = x^(2-1) * (y-1)^(7-2) = x * (y-1)^5\n6. A = {AB, BC, AD, DE, CF}: k(A) = 2, T(x, y) = x^(2-1) * (y-1)^(7-2) = x * (y-1)^5\n7. A = {AB, BC, AD, DE, CF, AE}: k(A) = 1, T(x, y) = x^(1-1) * (y-1)^(7-1) = (y-1)^6\n8. A = {AB, BC, AD, DE, CF, AE, BE}: k(A) = 1, T(x, y) = x^(1-1) * (y-1)^(7-1) = (y-1)^6\n\nNow, we sum up the Tutte polynomials for all subsets of edges:\n\nT(x, y) = x^5 * (y-1) + x^4 * (y-1)^2 + x^3 * (y-1)^3 + x^2 * (y-1)^4 + x * (y-1)^5 + x * (y-1)^5 + (y-1)^6 + (y-1)^6\n\nT(x, y) = x^5 * (y-1) + x^4 * (y-1)^2 + x^3 * (y-1)^3 + x^2 * (y-1)^4 + 2x * (y-1)^5 + 2(y-1)^6\n\nThis is the Tutte polynomial of the given graph."
