    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = 1/(z-1)(z+2) at the point z = -2, we first rewrite the function as a Laurent series around z = -2. \n\nLet's consider the function g(z) = f(z) * (z + 2), which is:\n\ng(z) = 1/(z-1)\n\nNow, we can find the value of g(z) at z = -2:\n\ng(-2) = 1/(-2 - 1) = -1/3\n\nThis value is the residue of the function f(z) at z = -2. Therefore, the residue is -1/3."
