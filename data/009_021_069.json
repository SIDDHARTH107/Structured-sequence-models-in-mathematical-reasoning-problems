    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = 6∂²u/∂x², \n\nwith the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(πx) and boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0. \n\nWhat is the solution u(x,t) of this partial differential equation, evaluated at x=0.5 and t=0.25?",
    "message_2": "This is a heat equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We can solve it using separation of variables. Let u(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Then,\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 6X''(x)T(t).\n\nDivide both sides by 6XT to get:\n\nT'(t) / (6T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x).\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nX''(x) / X(x) = T'(t) / (6T(t)) = -λ².\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0, with boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0,\nT'(t) + 6λ²T(t) = 0.\n\nThe boundary conditions for X(x) suggest that we have a sine series solution. So, let's assume X(x) = sin(nπx) for some integer n. Then,\n\nX''(x) = -n²π²sin(nπx).\n\nPlugging this into the X equation, we get:\n\n-n²π²sin(nπx) + λ²sin(nπx) = 0.\n\nThis equation holds for all x if λ² = n²π². Now, we can solve the T equation:\n\nT'(t) + 6n²π²T(t) = 0.\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-6n²π²t),\n\nwhere C is a constant. Now, the solution to the PDE is:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = Ce^(-6n²π²t)sin(nπx).\n\nTo satisfy the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(πx), we can use a Fourier sine series:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[C_n * e^(-6n²π²t) * sin(nπx)],\n\nwhere C_n are the Fourier coefficients. The initial condition gives:\n\nsin(πx) = ∑[C_n * sin(nπx)].\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get:\n\nC_n = δ(n,1),\n\nwhere δ is the Kronecker delta function. So, the solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = e^(-6π²t) * sin(πx).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the solution at x = 0.5 and t = 0.25:\n\nu(0.5, 0.25) = e^(-6π² * 0.25) * sin(π * 0.5) = e^(-9π²/2) * 1.\n\nThus, the solution u(x,t) at x = 0.5 and t = 0.25 is e^(-9π²/2)."
