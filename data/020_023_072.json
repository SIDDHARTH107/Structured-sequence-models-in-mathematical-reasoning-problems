The investor wants to allocate their portfolio such that they maximize their expected return while keeping the risk minimized. The following table shows the expected returns and standard deviations of each stock:\n\n| Stock | Expected Return | Standard Deviation |\n|-------|----------------|--------------------|\n| A     | 6%             | 10%                |\n| B     | 5%             | 8%                 |\n| C     | 8%             | 12%                |\n| D     | 4%             | 6%                 |\n\nWhat percentage of the investor's portfolio should be allocated to each stock in order to achieve the optimal portfolio selection?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio allocation, we need to consider the risk-return trade-off. One way to do this is by using the Sharpe Ratio, which measures the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio. The Sharpe Ratio is calculated as follows:\n\nSharpe Ratio = (Expected Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation\n\nAssuming a risk-free rate of 2%, we can calculate the Sharpe Ratio for each stock:\n\n| Stock | Expected Return | Standard Deviation | Sharpe Ratio |\n|-------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| A     | 6%             | 10%                | 0.4          |\n| B     | 5%             | 8%                 | 0.375        |\n| C     | 8%             | 12%                | 0.5          |\n| D     | 4%             | 6%                 | 0.333        |\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal weights for each stock in the portfolio. We can use the following formula:\n\nWeight = (Sharpe Ratio of Stock) / (Sum of Sharpe Ratios of All Stocks)\n\nCalculating the weights for each stock:\n\nWeight of Stock A = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.375 + 0.5 + 0.333) = 0.4 / 1.608 ≈ 0.2488 or 24.88%\nWeight of Stock B = 0.375 / 1.608 ≈ 0.2332 or 23.32%\nWeight of Stock C = 0.5 / 1.608 ≈ 0.3109 or 31.09%\nWeight of Stock D = 0.333 / 1.608 ≈ 0.2071 or 20.71%\n\nSo, the optimal portfolio allocation would be approximately:\n\nStock A: 24.88%\nStock B: 23.32%\nStock C: 31.09%\nStock D: 20.71%"
