    "message_2": "To find the number of rational curves of degree 4 that lie on a quintic surface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ with a fixed intersection number with a fixed plane, we can use the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps and Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\nLet $X$ be a quintic surface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, and let $\\beta$ be the homology class of a degree 4 curve in $X$. We want to compute the Gromov-Witten invariant $n_{\\beta}(X)$, which counts the number of rational curves in the class $\\beta$.\n\nBy the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps, we have a virtual fundamental class $[\\overline{M}_{0,0}(X, \\beta)]^{\\text{vir}}$ of dimension $0$. The Gromov-Witten invariant is given by the degree of this virtual fundamental class, i.e., $n_{\\beta}(X) = \\int_{[\\overline{M}_{0,0}(X, \\beta)]^{\\text{vir}}} 1$.\n\nComputing this integral is a difficult problem in general, and the answer depends on the specific quintic surface $X$ and the intersection number with the fixed plane. In some cases, the answer can be computed using mirror symmetry, localization techniques, or degeneration methods.\n\nIn summary, the number of rational curves of degree 4 that lie on a quintic surface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ with a fixed intersection number with a fixed plane depends on the specific surface and intersection number, and it requires advanced techniques from algebraic geometry and mathematical physics to compute."
