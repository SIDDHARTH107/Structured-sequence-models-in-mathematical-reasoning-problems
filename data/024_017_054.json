    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of vector v along the curve r(t), we need to solve the following equation:\n\n∇_r(t) v(t) = 0\n\nwhere ∇_r(t) is the covariant derivative along the curve r(t) and v(t) is the transported vector at time t.\n\nFirst, we need to find the tangent vector to the curve r(t). This can be found by taking the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = (3, 4t, 5)\n\nNow, we need to find the covariant derivative of v(t) along r(t). Since we are working in Euclidean space, the covariant derivative is the same as the regular derivative:\n\n∇_r(t) v(t) = v'(t)\n\nWe are looking for a vector v(t) such that its derivative along the curve is zero. This means that v(t) must be parallel to the tangent vector r'(t) at each point on the curve. We can write v(t) as:\n\nv(t) = k(t) * r'(t) = (3k(t), 4tk(t), 5k(t))\n\nwhere k(t) is a scalar function of t.\n\nNow, we need to find k(t) such that v(0) = (5, 4, 2). We can plug in t = 0 into the equation for v(t):\n\nv(0) = (3k(0), 4*0*k(0), 5k(0)) = (5, 4, 2)\n\nThis gives us:\n\n3k(0) = 5\n5k(0) = 2\n\nSolving for k(0), we get:\n\nk(0) = 5/3\n\nNow, we can plug k(0) back into the equation for v(t):\n\nv(t) = (5/3 * 3, 4t * 5/3, 5 * 5/3) = (5, 20t/3, 25/3)\n\nSo, the parallel transport of v along the curve r(t) is given by:\n\nv(t) = (5, 20t/3, 25/3)"
