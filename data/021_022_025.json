    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products: X and Y. The profit earned from each unit of X is $5, and that from each unit of Y is $8. The company has resources to manufacture up to 800 units of X and 700 units of Y. However, they only have demand for up to 500 units of X and 600 units of Y. Using firefly algorithm, determine the number of units of each product the company should manufacture to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that can be used to solve complex optimization problems. In this case, we will use the firefly algorithm to determine the optimal number of units of products X and Y to manufacture in order to maximize profit.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- x: number of units of product X\n- y: number of units of product Y\n- P(x, y): profit function, P(x, y) = 5x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 0 <= x <= 500 (demand constraint for product X)\n2. 0 <= y <= 600 (demand constraint for product Y)\n3. x <= 800 (resource constraint for product X)\n4. y <= 700 (resource constraint for product Y)\n\nWe will use the firefly algorithm to search for the optimal solution within the feasible region defined by the constraints.\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies (solutions) randomly within the feasible region.\n2. Define the attractiveness of a firefly based on the profit function P(x, y).\n3. For each firefly, move towards the more attractive (higher profit) fireflies by updating the position (x, y) based on the attractiveness and distance between fireflies.\n4. Update the attractiveness of each firefly based on their new positions.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution:\n\nx = 500 units of product X\ny = 600 units of product Y\n\nThe company should manufacture 500 units of product X and 600 units of product Y to maximize their profit. The maximum profit will be P(500, 600) = 5 * 500 + 8 * 600 = $7,300."
