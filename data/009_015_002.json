    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nA sample of radioactive material has a half-life of 10 days. If the initial mass of the sample is 100 grams, how much will be left after 20 days? \n\nHint: You can use the radioactive decay equation: \n\nN(t) = N₀ × 0.5^(t/T)\n\nWhere N₀ is the initial amount of material, t is the time passed, T is the half-life, and N(t) is the amount remaining after time t.",
    "message_2": "Using the radioactive decay equation provided, we can solve for the amount of radioactive material remaining after 20 days.\n\nN(t) = N₀ × 0.5^(t/T)\n\nHere, N₀ = 100 grams (initial mass), t = 20 days (time passed), and T = 10 days (half-life).\n\nN(20) = 100 × 0.5^(20/10)\n\nN(20) = 100 × 0.5^2\n\nN(20) = 100 × 0.25\n\nN(20) = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 20 days, there will be 25 grams of the radioactive material left."
