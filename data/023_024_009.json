The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x for -π < x ≤ 0 and f(x) = -x for 0 < x < π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] x dx + ∫[0, π] -x dx]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-x^2/2)|[-π, 0] + (x^2/2)|[0, π]]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(0 - (-π^2/2)) + (π^2/2 - 0)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * π^2 = π\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] x * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] -x * cos(n * x) dx]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we find that:\n\na_n = 0\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] x * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] -x * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we find that:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1 - (-1)^n) / n]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the given function:\n\nf(x) = π/2 + Σ[((1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π)) * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity."
