    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium solutions, we need to set dy/dt = 0 and solve for y:\n\n0 = y^2 - 2y\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can factor it as:\n\n0 = y(y - 2)\n\nThis gives us two equilibrium solutions: y = 0 and y = 2.\n\nNow, to determine the stability of these equilibrium solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the system near these points. We can do this by looking at the sign of the derivative dy/dt.\n\n1. For the equilibrium solution y = 0:\n\nLet's consider values of y slightly above and below 0:\n\n- If y > 0, then y^2 - 2y > 0 (since y^2 > 2y for 0 < y < 2), so dy/dt > 0. This means that the solution will increase and move away from the equilibrium point y = 0.\n\n- If y < 0, then y^2 - 2y < 0 (since y^2 < 2y for y < 0), so dy/dt < 0. This means that the solution will decrease and move away from the equilibrium point y = 0.\n\nSince the solution moves away from the equilibrium point y = 0 in both cases, this equilibrium point is unstable.\n\n2. For the equilibrium solution y = 2:\n\nLet's consider values of y slightly above and below 2:\n\n- If y > 2, then y^2 - 2y > 0 (since y^2 > 2y for y > 2), so dy/dt > 0. This means that the solution will increase and move away from the equilibrium point y = 2.\n\n- If y < 2, then y^2 - 2y < 0 (since y^2 < 2y for 0 < y < 2), so dy/dt < 0. This means that the solution will decrease and move towards the equilibrium point y = 2.\n\nSince the solution moves towards the equilibrium point y = 2 when y < 2 and moves away when y > 2, this equilibrium point is semi-stable or a saddle point.\n\nIn conclusion, the equilibrium solutions are y = 0 (unstable) and y = 2 (semi-stable)."
