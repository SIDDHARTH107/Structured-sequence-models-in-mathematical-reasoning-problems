    "message_2": "To find the smallest 4-digit number divisible by both 6 and 15, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 15.\n\n6 = 2 × 3\n15 = 3 × 5\n\nLCM(6, 15) = 2 × 3 × 5 = 30\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest 4-digit number that is divisible by 30. The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. We can divide 1000 by 30:\n\n1000 ÷ 30 = 33 remainder 10\n\nSo, 1000 is not divisible by 30. We need to find the next multiple of 30:\n\n33 × 30 = 990 (too small, as it's a 3-digit number)\n34 × 30 = 1020 (this is a 4-digit number and divisible by 30)\n\nTherefore, the smallest 4-digit number that is divisible by both 6 and 15 is 1020."
