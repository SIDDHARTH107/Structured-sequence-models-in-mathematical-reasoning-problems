After collecting data for 12 months, they have found the following information:\n\n- The average monthly advertising budget is $10,000.\n- The average monthly profit is $50,000.\n- The standard deviation of advertising budget is $2,000.\n- The standard deviation of monthly profit is $5,000.\n- The correlation coefficient between advertising budget and monthly profit is 0.8.\n\nUsing linear regression analysis, what is the predicted monthly profit if the company increases its advertising budget to $12,000 per month?",
    "message_2": "To predict the monthly profit based on the advertising budget using linear regression, we first need to find the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the regression line. The equation for the regression line is:\n\nY = a + bX\n\nwhere Y is the predicted monthly profit, X is the advertising budget, a is the y-intercept, and b is the slope.\n\nWe can find the slope (b) using the formula:\n\nb = r * (Sy / Sx)\n\nwhere r is the correlation coefficient, Sy is the standard deviation of the monthly profit, and Sx is the standard deviation of the advertising budget.\n\nb = 0.8 * (5000 / 2000)\nb = 0.8 * 2.5\nb = 2\n\nNow we need to find the y-intercept (a). We can use the average values of X and Y to find a:\n\na = Y - bX\n\nwhere Y is the average monthly profit and X is the average advertising budget.\n\na = 50000 - 2 * 10000\na = 50000 - 20000\na = 30000\n\nNow we have the equation for the regression line:\n\nY = 30000 + 2X\n\nTo predict the monthly profit when the advertising budget is $12,000, we can plug in the value of X:\n\nY = 30000 + 2 * 12000\nY = 30000 + 24000\nY = 54000\n\nSo, the predicted monthly profit if the company increases its advertising budget to $12,000 per month is $54,000."
