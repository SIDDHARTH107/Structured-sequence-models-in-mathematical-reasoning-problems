    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces laptops and the probability of a defect occurring in any given laptop is 0.05. If the company produces 500 laptops, what is the probability that at least 25 laptops are defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of laptops produced), k is the number of defective laptops, p is the probability of a defect occurring in any given laptop, and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\").\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability that at least 25 laptops are defective, which means we need to find the probability of 25 or more defective laptops. To do this, we can find the complement probability (the probability that fewer than 25 laptops are defective) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we need to find the probability that 0 to 24 laptops are defective and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 24\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 24 and sum them up:\n\nΣ P(X = k) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 24)\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula for each term:\n\nP(X = k) = (500Ck) * (0.05^k) * (0.95^(500-k))\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum and subtract it from 1 to find the probability that at least 25 laptops are defective:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - Σ P(X = k)\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use software or a calculator with built-in statistical functions to find the result. Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) ≈ 0.8913\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 laptops are defective is approximately 0.8913 or 89.13%."
