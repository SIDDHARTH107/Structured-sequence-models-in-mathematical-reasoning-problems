    "message_2": "To find A x B, we will form ordered pairs with the elements of A as the first element and the elements of B as the second element. \n\nA x B = {(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B. We need to define a universal set U for both A and B to find their complements. Let's assume U = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} for simplicity.\n\nA' = U - A = {0, 1}\nB' = U - B = {3, 4}\n\nNow, we will find A' x B':\n\nA' x B' = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4)}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over complement. If it is distributive, then (A x B)' = A' x B'. To find (A x B)', we need to find the complement of A x B in the universal set U x U.\n\nU x U = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\n(A x B)' = U x U - A x B = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nWe can see that (A x B)' â‰  A' x B' since the two sets are not equal. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
