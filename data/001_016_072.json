    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $5^3 \\cdot 5^4$, we can use the product of powers property, which states that $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$, where a is the base and m and n are the exponents.\n\nIn this case, the base is 5, and the exponents are 3 and 4. So, we can add the exponents:\n\n$5^3 \\cdot 5^4 = 5^{3+4} = 5^7$\n\nTherefore, the simplified exponential expression is $5^7$."
