    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial 2x^2 + 7x + 6, we can use the \"ac method.\"\n\n1. Multiply the leading coefficient (a = 2) and the constant term (c = 6) to get ac = 12.\n\n2. Find two numbers that multiply to ac (12) and add up to the middle coefficient (b = 7). These numbers are 3 and 4.\n\n3. Rewrite the middle term (7x) as the sum of the two numbers found in step 2: 2x^2 + 3x + 4x + 6.\n\n4. Factor by grouping:\n   - Group the first two terms and the last two terms: (2x^2 + 3x) + (4x + 6).\n   - Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group:\n     - GCF of (2x^2 + 3x) is x, so we get x(2x + 3).\n     - GCF of (4x + 6) is 2, so we get 2(2x + 3).\n\n5. Notice that both groups have a common binomial factor (2x + 3). Factor this out to get the final factored form: (x + 2)(2x + 3)."
