    "message_1": "In a certain population, the probability of a person having a certain medical condition is 0.07. If a random sample of 250 people from this population is taken, what is the probability that at least 20 of them have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, people with the medical condition) in n trials (sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (having the medical condition) on a single trial\n- n is the sample size (number of people in the sample)\n- k is the number of successes (people with the medical condition)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 20 people have the medical condition, which means we need to find the probability for 20, 21, 22, ..., 250 people having the condition and sum them up. However, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can find the probability of the complementary event (less than 20 people having the condition) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we need to find the probability of 0, 1, 2, ..., 19 people having the condition and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 20) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)\n\nThen, we can find the probability of at least 20 people having the condition by subtracting the complementary probability from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20)\n\nLet's calculate P(X < 20) using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ [C(250, k) * (0.07)^k * (1-0.07)^(250-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can use a calculator or software to compute this sum:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.9526\n\nFinally, we find the probability of at least 20 people having the condition:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - 0.9526 ≈ 0.0474\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 people in the sample of 250 have the medical condition is approximately 0.0474 or 4.74%."
