    "message_2": "Let's use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We have 26 employees (stars) and we need to divide them into 3 teams (2 bars). We also know that each team must have at least 5 members.\n\nFirst, let's assign 5 members to each team to satisfy the minimum requirement. Now we have 11 employees left to distribute among the 3 teams.\n\nWe can now use the stars and bars method to distribute the remaining 11 employees among the 3 teams. We have 11 stars (employees) and 2 bars (divisions).\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is the combination of (11+2) objects taken 2 at a time, which is C(13,2).\n\nC(13,2) = 13! / (2! * (13-2)!) = 13! / (2! * 11!) = (13 * 12) / (2 * 1) = 78\n\nSo, there are 78 ways to divide the 26 employees into 3 teams such that each team has at least 5 members."
