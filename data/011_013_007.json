    "message_2": "To find the number of different ways to arrange these beads, we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset:\n\nn! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of beads, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of beads of each color.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (total beads), n1 = 4 (red beads), n2 = 3 (blue beads), and n3 = 3 (green beads).\n\nSo the number of different arrangements is:\n\n10! / (4! * 3! * 3!) = 3628800 / (24 * 6 * 6) = 151200\n\nThere are 151,200 different ways to arrange these beads with no restrictions on their order."
