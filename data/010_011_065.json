    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a compact 2-dimensional manifold M with genus g can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2g\n\nIn this case, the genus g is given as 2. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the given 2-dimensional compact manifold with genus 2 is -2."
