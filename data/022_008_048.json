    "message_2": "To find all entire functions $f(z)$ satisfying the given condition, we will use Liouville's Theorem and Cauchy's Inequality.\n\nLiouville's Theorem states that every bounded entire function is constant.\n\nCauchy's Inequality states that for an entire function $f(z)$ and a circle $|z - z_0| = R$ centered at $z_0$ with radius $R$, the $n$-th derivative of $f$ at $z_0$ satisfies:\n\n$$|f^{(n)}(z_0)| \\leq \\frac{n!}{R^n} \\max_{|z - z_0| = R} |f(z)|$$\n\nNow, let's consider the given condition $|f(z)|\\leq 2|z|^2$. We will apply Cauchy's Inequality for $n = 2$ and $z_0 = 0$:\n\n$$|f''(0)| \\leq \\frac{2!}{R^2} \\max_{|z| = R} |f(z)|$$\n\nSince $|f(z)|\\leq 2|z|^2$, we have:\n\n$$|f''(0)| \\leq \\frac{2!}{R^2} \\cdot 2R^2 = 4$$\n\nThis inequality holds for all $R > 0$. Now, let $R \\to \\infty$. We get:\n\n$$|f''(0)| \\leq 0$$\n\nSince $|f''(0)|$ is non-negative, this implies that $f''(0) = 0$. Therefore, the second derivative of $f(z)$ is zero at $z = 0$. Since $f(z)$ is entire, this means that $f''(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, we can integrate $f''(z)$ twice to obtain the general form of $f(z)$:\n\n$$f'(z) = az + b$$\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}az^2 + bz + c$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are constants.\n\nNow, we need to check if this general form satisfies the given condition $|f(z)|\\leq 2|z|^2$. We have:\n\n$$|f(z)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2}az^2 + bz + c\\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}|a||z|^2 + |b||z| + |c|$$\n\nFor this inequality to hold for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we must have:\n\n1. $\\frac{1}{2}|a| \\leq 2$, which implies $|a| \\leq 4$.\n2. $|b| = 0$, which implies $b = 0$.\n3. $|c|$ is a constant, which implies $c$ is a constant.\n\nTherefore, the general form of $f(z)$ that satisfies the given condition is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}az^2 + c$$\n\nwhere $|a| \\leq 4$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are constants."
