    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter, d = 14 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(14 cm)\n\nUsing the value of π ≈ 3.14, we get:\n\nC ≈ 3.14(14 cm) = 43.96 cm\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 43.96 cm."
