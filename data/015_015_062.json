    "message_1": "Here is a possible precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n \nConsider a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction whose evolution is described by the following system of ordinary differential equations (in dimensionless form):\n\ndx/dt = a(y-x) + z,\n\ndy/dt = bx - xy - xz,\n\ndz/dt = -c(z+f(x,y)),\n\nwhere a,b,c are positive parameters, and f(x,y) is a cubic polynomial. Assume that the initial conditions are x(0)=1, y(0)=2, and z(0)=3.\n\nFind the time t* when the concentration of species z reaches its global maximum, and determine the corresponding values of x(t*) and y(t*).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum of the function z(t) given the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Since we don't have an explicit expression for z(t), we'll first need to find the critical points of the system by setting the time derivatives equal to zero and solving for x, y, and z. Then, we'll analyze the stability of these critical points to determine if they correspond to a maximum of z(t).\n\n1. Find the critical points:\n\nSet dx/dt = 0, dy/dt = 0, and dz/dt = 0:\n\na(y-x) + z = 0,\nbx - xy - xz = 0,\n-c(z+f(x,y)) = 0.\n\nFrom the third equation, we have two possibilities: either z = -f(x,y) or c = 0. Since c is a positive parameter, we can discard the second possibility. So, we have z = -f(x,y).\n\nSubstitute z = -f(x,y) into the first equation:\n\na(y-x) - f(x,y) = 0.\n\nNow, we have two equations and three unknowns (x, y, and z):\n\na(y-x) - f(x,y) = 0,\nbx - xy - xz = 0,\nz = -f(x,y).\n\nTo proceed, we need more information about the cubic polynomial f(x,y). Without this information, we cannot find the critical points and determine the maximum of z(t).\n\n2. Analyze the stability of the critical points:\n\nOnce we have the critical points, we would linearize the system of ODEs around these points and analyze the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix to determine the stability of the critical points. If a critical point is a local maximum of z(t), then it corresponds to the global maximum since z(t) is a continuous function.\n\n3. Find the time t* and the corresponding values of x(t*) and y(t*):\n\nOnce we have the critical point corresponding to the global maximum of z(t), we would need to solve the system of ODEs with the given initial conditions (x(0)=1, y(0)=2, and z(0)=3) to find the time t* when the concentration of species z reaches its global maximum and the corresponding values of x(t*) and y(t*). This can be done using numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to approximate the solution of the system of ODEs.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the cubic polynomial f(x,y), we cannot find the critical points and determine the maximum of z(t). Once we have this information, we can follow the steps outlined above to find the time t* and the corresponding values of x(t*) and y(t*)."
