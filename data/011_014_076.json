    "message_2": "Let's use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this graph, each of the 7 vertices has a degree of 3 (connected to 3 other vertices). So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 7 * 3 = 21.\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to 2 * the number of edges. Therefore, we have:\n\n21 = 2 * number of edges\n\nTo find the number of edges, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nnumber of edges = 21 / 2 = 10.5\n\nHowever, the number of edges must be an integer, so there is a contradiction in the problem statement. It is not possible to have a graph with 7 vertices where each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices."
