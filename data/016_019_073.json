    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each line segment is divided by 3, and 4 new segments are created. \n\nLet's denote the length of the Koch island after the nth iteration as L_n. After the first iteration (n=1), the length of each side of the triangle is 4/3 times the original length, so L_1 = 3 * (4/3) = 4.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the length of each segment is divided by 3, and 4 new segments are created. Therefore, the total length of the Koch island after the nth iteration is given by the formula:\n\nL_n = 3 * (4/3)^n\n\nNow, we can find the total length of the Koch island after the 4th iteration:\n\nL_4 = 3 * (4/3)^4\nL_4 = 3 * (256/81)\nL_4 = 768/81 â‰ˆ 9.4815\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch island after the 4th iteration is approximately 9.4815."
