    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2). According to the Sylow theorems, there must exist a subgroup of G of order 3. Let H be a subgroup of G with order 3. Since the order of H is prime, H is cyclic, and there exists an element x in G such that H = {e, x, x^2}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is 9/3 = 3, which is prime. Therefore, G/H is also cyclic. Let G/H = {H, yH, y^2H}, where y is an element of G that is not in H. Note that y^3 is in H, since the order of G/H is 3. Thus, y^3 = x^k for some integer k, where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIn this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. To show this, we can define a homomorphism φ: C9 → G by φ(1) = y, where 1 is the generator of C9. Since G is abelian, the map φ is a homomorphism. Moreover, φ is surjective, since every element of G can be written as a product of powers of x and y. Finally, φ is injective, since the order of G is 9 and the order of C9 is also 9. Therefore, φ is an isomorphism, and G is isomorphic to C9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIn this case, we will show that G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 9. Let's define the elements of G as {e, x, x^2, y, yx, yx^2, y^2, y^2x, y^2x^2}. We can define the multiplication in G as follows:\n\n1. Multiplication by e: For any element g in G, eg = ge = g.\n2. Multiplication by x: For any element g in G, xg = gx, since x is in the center of G.\n3. Multiplication by y: For any element g in G, yg = gy^(-1), since G is non-abelian.\n\nNow, we need to show that G is closed under multiplication. We can verify this by checking the products of all pairs of elements in G. For example, (yx)(yx) = y(xy^(-1))x = y(y^2x^2) = y^3x^3 = x^3 = x, since y^3 = x^k for some integer k. Similarly, we can check all other products and confirm that G is closed under multiplication.\n\nNext, we need to show that the inverse and identity elements are present in G. The identity element e is clearly present. For any element g in G, its inverse can be found as follows:\n\n1. For x and x^2, their inverses are x^2 and x, respectively.\n2. For y, yx, and yx^2, their inverses are y^2, y^2x^2, and y^2x, respectively.\n3. For y^2, y^2x, and y^2x^2, their inverses are y, yx^2, and yx, respectively.\n\nThus, G is a non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that if G is a group of order 9, it must be isomorphic either to the cyclic group C9 (if G is abelian) or to a non-abelian group of order 9 (if G is non-abelian)."
