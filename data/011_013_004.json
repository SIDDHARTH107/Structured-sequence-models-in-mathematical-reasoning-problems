    "message_1": "Consider a set of $5$ balls, each of different color. We want to color a necklace made of $10$ beads using these $5$ colors, with each bead being colored with one of the $5$ colors. How many distinct necklaces can be made such that no two necklaces are the same after rotation?\n\nHint: Use Polya's Enumeration Theorem to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's Enumeration Theorem, we need to find the cycle index polynomial of the group action on the necklace. The group action here is the dihedral group $D_{10}$, which has $10$ rotational symmetries and $10$ reflectional symmetries. We will only consider the rotational symmetries, as reflections do not matter in this case.\n\nThe cycle index polynomial is given by:\n\n$P(G) = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} p_g(x_1, x_2, \\dots)$\n\nwhere $p_g(x_1, x_2, \\dots)$ is the cycle structure of the permutation $g$ and $|G|$ is the order of the group.\n\nFor the dihedral group $D_{10}$, we have the following rotational symmetries:\n\n1. Identity (no rotation): This has a cycle structure of $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$, so $p_g(x_1, x_2, \\dots) = x_1^{10}$.\n2. Rotation by $36^\\circ$: This has a cycle structure of $(10)$, so $p_g(x_1, x_2, \\dots) = x_{10}$.\n3. Rotation by $72^\\circ$: This has a cycle structure of $(5, 5)$, so $p_g(x_1, x_2, \\dots) = x_5^2$.\n4. Rotation by $108^\\circ$: This has the same cycle structure as $72^\\circ$, so $p_g(x_1, x_2, \\dots) = x_5^2$.\n5. Rotation by $144^\\circ$: This has the same cycle structure as $36^\\circ$, so $p_g(x_1, x_2, \\dots) = x_{10}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the cycle index polynomial:\n\n$P(G) = \\frac{1}{5} (x_1^{10} + x_{10} + x_5^2 + x_5^2 + x_{10}) = \\frac{1}{5} (x_1^{10} + 2x_{10} + 2x_5^2)$\n\nTo find the number of distinct colorings, we substitute $x_i = 5$ for all $i$:\n\n$P(5, 5, \\dots) = \\frac{1}{5} (5^{10} + 2 \\cdot 5^1 + 2 \\cdot 5^2) = \\frac{1}{5} (9765625 + 50) = 1953125$\n\nSo, there are $1,953,125$ distinct necklaces that can be made using the $5$ colors."
