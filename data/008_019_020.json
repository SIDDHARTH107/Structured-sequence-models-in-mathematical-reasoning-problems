Let's rewrite the given equations as:\n\n(1) 3x + 4yi = 7 + 2i\n(2) 2x - 5yi = -2i\n\nNow, separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n(1a) 3x = 7\n(1b) 4y = 2\n\n(2a) 2x = 0\n(2b) -5y = -2\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y:\n\nFrom (1a), we have:\nx = 7/3\n\nFrom (1b), we have:\ny = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can check if these values satisfy the second equation:\n\n(2a) 2x = 2(7/3) = 14/3 â‰  0\n(2b) -5y = -5(1/2) = -5/2 = -2\n\nSince the values of x and y do not satisfy the second equation, there is no solution to the given system of linear equations with complex coefficients."
