    "message_1": "A cube has a side length of 5 cm. What is the surface area of the cube, in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of the cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 faces).\n\nThe area of a square can be found using the formula: Area = side × side\n\nIn this case, the side length is 5 cm. So, the area of one face is:\n\nArea = 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube:\n\nSurface Area = 6 × 25 square centimeters = 150 square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
