Each number on an edge represents the maximum amount of fluid that can flow through that edge per unit of time. Your task is to determine the maximum amount of fluid that can be transported from the source to the destination per unit of time.\n\n```\nSource --> [10] --> A --> [5] --> C --> [20] --> Destination\n        |                         |^                  |\n        ˅                         ||                  ˅    \n       [5]                       [15]                [10]\n        |                         |                   |\n        ˅                         |˅                  ˅    \n        B                        D                   E\n        |                         |                   |\n        ˅                         |˅                  ˅    \n       [15]                      [10]                [15]\n        |                         ||                  |\n        V                         V^                  V\n```\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of fluid that can be transported from the source to the destination per unit of time in this network?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of fluid that can be transported from the source to the destination per unit of time, we need to find the maximum flow through the network. We can do this by analyzing the different paths from the source to the destination and their capacities.\n\nPath 1: Source -> A -> C -> Destination\nCapacity: min(10, 5, 20) = 5\n\nPath 2: Source -> B -> D -> C -> Destination\nCapacity: min(5, 15, 10, 20) = 5\n\nPath 3: Source -> B -> E -> Destination\nCapacity: min(5, 15, 10) = 5\n\nThe maximum flow through the network is the sum of the capacities of these paths: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15. Therefore, the maximum amount of fluid that can be transported from the source to the destination per unit of time in this network is 15."
