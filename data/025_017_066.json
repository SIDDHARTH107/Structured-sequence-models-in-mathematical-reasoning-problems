    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of V over the real numbers, we first need to find a birational transformation that simplifies the equation. A birational transformation is a one-to-one correspondence between the points of two algebraic varieties that is defined by rational functions.\n\nConsider the change of variables:\n\nu = x^2\nv = y^2\nw = z^2\ns = t^2\n\nSubstituting these variables into the equation for V, we get:\n\nu^2 + v^2 + w^2 + s^2 = 4\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n(u^2 + v^2) + (w^2 + s^2) = 4\n\nThis equation represents the sum of two squares, which can be factored as a product of two differences of squares:\n\n(u^2 + v^2 - 2) * (w^2 + s^2 - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1) u^2 + v^2 = 2\n2) w^2 + s^2 = 2\n\nEach of these cases represents a circle in the uv-plane and the ws-plane, respectively. The minimal model of V over the real numbers is the union of these two circles, which can be parametrized as follows:\n\nCase 1:\nu = sqrt(2) * cos(θ)\nv = sqrt(2) * sin(θ)\nw = sqrt(2) * cos(φ)\ns = sqrt(2) * sin(φ)\n\nCase 2:\nu = sqrt(2) * cos(θ)\nv = sqrt(2) * sin(θ)\nw = sqrt(2) * cos(φ)\ns = sqrt(2) * sin(φ)\n\nIn both cases, θ and φ range from 0 to 2π. The minimal model of V over the real numbers is given by these parametrizations."
