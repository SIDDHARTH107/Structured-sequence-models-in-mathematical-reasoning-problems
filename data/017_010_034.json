    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 10, by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 5, which is C2 x C5. Note that C2 x C5 is isomorphic to D5, the dihedral group of order 10. There is no non-abelian group of order 10 other than D5.\n\nTo determine whether G is isomorphic to C10 or D5, we will use the fact that a group is abelian if and only if its order is the product of the orders of its elements.\n\nLet's consider the number of elements of order 2 and 5 in G. Since G has order 10, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 5, and 10. There is only one element of order 1, which is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow theorems. G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup (since 5 is prime and 5^1 divides 10, but 5^2 does not), which must be of order 5. This Sylow 5-subgroup is cyclic, as all groups of prime order are cyclic. Let's call this subgroup H. Since H is unique, it is normal in G. H has four elements of order 5 (excluding the identity element).\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroup of G. G has either one or five Sylow 2-subgroups (since 2^1 divides 10, but 2^2 does not). If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal in G. In this case, G would be the direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 5-subgroup, which would make G isomorphic to C2 x C5, and hence to D5.\n\nIf G has five Sylow 2-subgroups, then there are five elements of order 2 in G. In this case, G has one element of order 1, four elements of order 5, and five elements of order 2. This accounts for all 10 elements of G. Since the number of elements of order 2 and 5 in G is the product of the orders of its elements, G must be abelian. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. To determine which one, we can check whether G is abelian or not. If G is abelian, it is isomorphic to C10; otherwise, it is isomorphic to D5. There is no non-abelian group of order 10 other than D5."
