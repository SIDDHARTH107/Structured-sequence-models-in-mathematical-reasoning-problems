    "message_2": "Let's denote the angle measuring 60 degrees as A, the side opposite to angle A as a, the side adjacent to angle A as b, and the hypotenuse as c. In this case, c = 10 cm.\n\nWe can use the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios to find the values of a and b.\n\n1. Sine (sin):\nsin(A) = a/c\nsin(60) = a/10\n\nSince sin(60) = √3/2, we can write the equation as:\n(√3/2) = a/10\n\nSolving for a:\na = 10(√3/2) = 5√3 cm\n\n2. Cosine (cos):\ncos(A) = b/c\ncos(60) = b/10\n\nSince cos(60) = 1/2, we can write the equation as:\n(1/2) = b/10\n\nSolving for b:\nb = 10(1/2) = 5 cm\n\nNow we have the values of a and b, and we can find the tangent ratio.\n\n3. Tangent (tan):\ntan(A) = a/b\ntan(60) = (5√3)/5\n\nSimplifying the expression:\ntan(60) = √3\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for the 60-degree angle are as follows:\n\nsin(60) = √3/2\ncos(60) = 1/2\ntan(60) = √3"
