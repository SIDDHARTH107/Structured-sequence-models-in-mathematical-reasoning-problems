    "message_1": "Consider the problem of sorting a list of n numbers in ascending order. Let f(n) be the number of comparisons needed to sort this list, and let g(n) be the number of operations needed to perform this sorting. If we assume that each comparison takes one operation and each swap takes three operations, then we can express f(n) and g(n) as:\n\nf(n) = a * n * log2(n) + b * n\ng(n) = c * n * log2(n) + d * n\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are constants. Find the values of a, b, c, and d given that f(8) = 30 and g(8) = 68.",
    "message_2": "We are given that f(8) = 30 and g(8) = 68. Let's plug in n = 8 into the equations for f(n) and g(n):\n\n30 = a * 8 * log2(8) + b * 8\n68 = c * 8 * log2(8) + d * 8\n\nSince log2(8) = 3, we can simplify the equations:\n\n30 = 24a + 8b\n68 = 24c + 8d\n\nNow, we can divide both equations by 8:\n\n3.75 = 3a + b\n8.5 = 3c + d\n\nWe have two systems of linear equations:\n\nSystem 1:\n3a + b = 3.75\n\nSystem 2:\n3c + d = 8.5\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot solve for the exact values of a, b, c, and d with only one equation for each system. We would need more information or constraints on the problem to uniquely determine the values of a, b, c, and d."
