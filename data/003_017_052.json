    "message_2": "To find the average value of the sine function over one complete period, we can integrate the sine function over the period and divide by the length of the period.\n\nFirst, let's find the period of the pendulum. The angular speed is given as 2 radians/second, and the pendulum swings through an angle of 60°, which is equivalent to π/3 radians. The time it takes for the pendulum to swing from one extreme to the other is:\n\nT/2 = (π/3) / 2\nT/2 = π/6\nT = π/3\n\nNow, let's integrate the sine function over one complete period:\n\n∫(sin(x) dx) from 0 to π/3\n\nThe integral of sin(x) is -cos(x), so:\n\n[-cos(x)] from 0 to π/3 = -cos(π/3) - (-cos(0)) = -1/2 - (-1) = 1/2\n\nNow, we'll divide this result by the length of the period:\n\n(1/2) / (π/3) = (1/2) * (3/π) = 3/(2π)\n\nSo, the average value of the sine function over one complete period is 3/(2π)."
