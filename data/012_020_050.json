    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms.\n\nIn the given graph, we can observe the following automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity: Keep all vertices in their original positions.\n2. Rotation by 120 degrees clockwise: A -> B, B -> C, C -> A, D -> E, E -> F, F -> D.\n3. Rotation by 240 degrees clockwise: A -> C, B -> A, C -> B, D -> F, E -> D, F -> E.\n\nThese are the only automorphisms that preserve adjacency in the given graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph has 3 elements, and can be represented as {Identity, Rotation by 120 degrees, Rotation by 240 degrees}."
