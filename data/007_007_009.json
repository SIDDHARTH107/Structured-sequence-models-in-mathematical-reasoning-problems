    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 7x + 9y = 123, we first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 9, which is 1. Since 1 divides 123, there exist integer solutions for this equation.\n\nNow, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers a and b such that:\n\n7a + 9b = GCD(7, 9) = 1\n\n7(-1) + 9(1) = 1\n\nSo, a = -1 and b = 1.\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the equation by 123:\n\n7(-1)(123) + 9(1)(123) = 123\n\n-861 + 1107 = 123\n\nThus, one particular solution is x = -861 and y = 1107.\n\nNow, we can find the general solution by adding integer multiples of the coefficients of the other variable:\n\nx = -861 + 9t\ny = 1107 - 7t\n\nwhere t is an integer.\n\nFor example, if t = 0, we have the particular solution x = -861 and y = 1107.\nIf t = 1, we have x = -852 and y = 1100.\nIf t = 2, we have x = -843 and y = 1093.\n\nAnd so on. The general solution to the Diophantine equation 7x + 9y = 123 is given by:\n\nx = -861 + 9t\ny = 1107 - 7t\n\nwhere t is an integer."
