Find the values of $x_A, x_B, y_A, y_B, z_A, z_B,$ and $w_A$ if player B chooses to offer $2$ and player A chooses to offer $3$ in the game of Traveler's Dilemma.",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, the payoffs are determined by the following rules:\n\n1. If both players choose the same number, they both receive that amount.\n2. If one player chooses a higher number than the other, the player who chose the higher number receives $1 less than the lower number, and the player who chose the lower number receives $2 more than the lower number.\n\nGiven that player A chooses to offer $3$ and player B chooses to offer $2$, we can determine the payoffs as follows:\n\n- $x_A, x_B$: Both players choose $2$. According to rule 1, they both receive $2$. So, $x_A = x_B = 2$.\n- $y_A, y_B$: Player A chooses $3$, and player B chooses $2$. According to rule 2, player A receives $1$ less than the lower number ($2 - 1 = 1$), and player B receives $2$ more than the lower number ($2 + 2 = 4$). So, $y_A = 1$ and $y_B = 4$.\n- $z_A, z_B$: Player A chooses $2$, and player B chooses $3$. According to rule 2, player A receives $2$ more than the lower number ($2 + 2 = 4$), and player B receives $1$ less than the lower number ($2 - 1 = 1$). So, $z_A = 4$ and $z_B = 1$.\n- $w_A, w_B$: Both players choose $3$. According to rule 1, they both receive $3$. So, $w_A = w_B = 3$.\n\nThe updated payoff matrix is:\n\n|           | Player B's Offer |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n|           |  $2$  |  $3$  |\n| Player A's Offer | $2$  | $2, 2$ | $1, 4$ |\n| | $3$ | $4, 1$ | $3, 3$ |"
