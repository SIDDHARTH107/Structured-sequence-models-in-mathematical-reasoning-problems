Determine the stability of the critical points and classify them as either sources, sinks, saddles, or centers.",
    "message_2": "To solve this nonlinear dynamical system, we will use the numerical method known as the Runge-Kutta method (specifically, the 4th order Runge-Kutta method). This method is widely used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the system of ODEs as:\n\ndx/dt = f(x, y) = y,\ndy/dt = g(x, y) = -x^3 - 2x.\n\nNow, let's implement the 4th order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n1. Define the functions f(x, y) and g(x, y).\n2. Choose a step size h and the number of steps N.\n3. Initialize the initial conditions x(0) = 1 and y(0) = 0.\n4. Iterate the following steps for i = 0 to N-1:\n   a. k1_x = h * f(x[i], y[i])\n   b. k1_y = h * g(x[i], y[i])\n   c. k2_x = h * f(x[i] + 0.5 * k1_x, y[i] + 0.5 * k1_y)\n   d. k2_y = h * g(x[i] + 0.5 * k1_x, y[i] + 0.5 * k1_y)\n   e. k3_x = h * f(x[i] + 0.5 * k2_x, y[i] + 0.5 * k2_y)\n   f. k3_y = h * g(x[i] + 0.5 * k2_x, y[i] + 0.5 * k2_y)\n   g. k4_x = h * f(x[i] + k3_x, y[i] + k3_y)\n   h. k4_y = h * g(x[i] + k3_x, y[i] + k3_y)\n   i. x[i+1] = x[i] + (k1_x + 2 * k2_x + 2 * k3_x + k4_x) / 6\n   j. y[i+1] = y[i] + (k1_y + 2 * k2_y + 2 * k3_y + k4_y) / 6\n\nAfter running the above algorithm, we will obtain the numerical solution for x(t) and y(t). We can then plot the phase portrait by plotting y(t) against x(t).\n\nTo determine the stability of the critical points, we need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y |\n          | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |\n\nJ(x, y) = |  0   1  |\n          | -3x^2-2  0 |\n\nThe critical point of the system is (0, 0), so we evaluate the Jacobian at this point:\n\nJ(0, 0) = |  0   1  |\n          | -2   0  |\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix:\n\ndet(J - λI) = | -λ  1  |\n              | -2  -λ |\n\nλ^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = i√2 and λ2 = -i√2. Since the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, the critical point (0, 0) is a center. This means that the trajectories around the critical point are closed orbits, and the system is neutrally stable at this point."
