    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a 3-dimensional manifold and let $T$ be a tensor field of order 2 on $M$ such that $T_{ij} = x_i x_j$ for all $i,j$, where $\\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\}$ is a local coordinate system on $M$. Determine the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the vector field $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}$, we use the following formula for the covariant derivative of a tensor field of order 2:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)_{ij} = X(T_{ij}) - T_{kj} \\Gamma^k_{i1} - T_{ik} \\Gamma^k_{j1}$\n\nHere, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by:\n\n$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\frac{\\partial g_{li}}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial g_{lj}}{\\partial x_i} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x_l})$\n\nwhere $g_{ij}$ is the metric tensor and $g^{ij}$ is its inverse.\n\nNow, we are given that $T_{ij} = x_i x_j$. So, we have:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)_{ij} = X(x_i x_j) - x_k x_j \\Gamma^k_{i1} - x_i x_k \\Gamma^k_{j1}$\n\nSince $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}$, we have:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial (x_i x_j)}{\\partial x_1} - x_k x_j \\Gamma^k_{i1} - x_i x_k \\Gamma^k_{j1}$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivative:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (x_i x_j)}{\\partial x_1} = \\delta_{i1} x_j + \\delta_{j1} x_i$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if $i = j$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)_{ij} = \\delta_{i1} x_j + \\delta_{j1} x_i - x_k x_j \\Gamma^k_{i1} - x_i x_k \\Gamma^k_{j1}$\n\nTo proceed further, we need to know the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ and its inverse $g^{ij}$, as well as the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$. However, without this information, we cannot compute the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the vector field $X$."
