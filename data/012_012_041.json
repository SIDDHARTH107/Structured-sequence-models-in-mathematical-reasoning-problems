    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of G, we will analyze the given degree sequence and construct the graph.\n\nLet's label the vertices as follows based on their degrees:\n- Vertices A and B have degree 3.\n- Vertices C and D have degree 2.\n- Vertices E, F, G, and H have degree 1.\n\nSince G is connected, vertices E, F, G, and H must be connected to the other vertices with higher degrees. Let's connect them as follows:\n- E connects to A\n- F connects to A\n- G connects to B\n- H connects to B\n\nNow, A and B still have one more edge to be connected, and C and D have two edges each. We can connect A to C, A to D, B to C, and B to D. This results in the following graph:\n\n```\n  A -- C\n /|    |\\\nE F    G H\n \\|    |/\n  B -- D\n```\n\nIn this graph, the shortest cycle is A-C-B-D-A, which has a length of 4. Therefore, the girth of G is 4."
