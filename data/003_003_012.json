    "message_2": "Using the unit circle, the value of sin(45°) can be determined by finding the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle. Since 45° is halfway between 0° and 90°, it is a special angle, and the coordinates of the point can be expressed in terms of a 45-45-90 right triangle.\n\nIn a 45-45-90 right triangle, the two legs are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of each leg. Since the unit circle has a radius of 1, the hypotenuse is 1, and the length of each leg is 1/√2 or √2/2.\n\nTherefore, the value of sin(45°) is equal to the y-coordinate of the point, which is √2/2 or approximately 0.7071."
