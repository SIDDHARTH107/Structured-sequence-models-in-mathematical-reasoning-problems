    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let p and q be distinct primes dividing the order of G, which is 12. Then, we have p = 2 and q = 3.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow p-subgroups, n_p, divides q and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p). Similarly, the number of Sylow q-subgroups, n_q, divides p and n_q ≡ 1 (mod q).\n\nFor p = 2, we have n_2 divides 3, so n_2 can be either 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let's call this subgroup P.\n\nFor q = 3, we have n_3 divides 2, so n_3 must be 1. Thus, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let's call this subgroup Q.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G and their intersection is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element), we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is G ≅ P × Q.\n\nNow, we consider the possible isomorphisms:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C12, then P must be isomorphic to C4 and Q must be isomorphic to C3. In this case, the isomorphism mapping would be φ: G → C12, where φ(pg) = p^a * g^b, with a and b being the orders of the elements in P and Q, respectively.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to A4, then P must be isomorphic to V4 (the Klein four-group) and Q must be isomorphic to C3. In this case, the isomorphism mapping would be φ: G → A4, where φ(pg) = (1 2)^a * (1 2 3)^b, with a and b being the orders of the elements in P and Q, respectively.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to D6, then P must be isomorphic to C2 and Q must be isomorphic to C6. In this case, the isomorphism mapping would be φ: G → D6, where φ(pg) = r^a * s^b, with a and b being the orders of the elements in P and Q, respectively.\n\nTo determine which of the three groups G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the specific group G. However, we have shown that G must be isomorphic to one of the three groups C12, A4, or D6, and we have provided the isomorphism mappings for each case."
