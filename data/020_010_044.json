    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem related to Robust Optimization:\n\nA company manufactures two products, A and B, with a profit margin of $10 and $8 per unit respectively. The demand for these products is uncertain due to market fluctuations. The upper and lower bounds for the demand of product A are 50 and 30 units respectively, while for product B they are 70 and 40 units respectively. The company wants to determine the optimal production quantities that would maximize their expected profit, while also minimizing the potential loss due to demand uncertainty. What is the optimal production quantity for each product?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of robust optimization. We will consider the worst-case scenario for each product's demand and find the optimal production quantity that maximizes profit while minimizing potential loss.\n\nLet x be the production quantity of product A and y be the production quantity of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 10x + 8y\n\nWe need to consider the worst-case scenario for the demand of each product. For product A, the lower bound of demand is 30 units, and for product B, the lower bound of demand is 40 units.\n\nWe can set up the following constraints for the production quantities:\n\nx ≥ 30 (to ensure that the production quantity of product A is at least 30 units)\ny ≥ 40 (to ensure that the production quantity of product B is at least 40 units)\n\nNow we can solve the linear programming problem to find the optimal production quantities for products A and B.\n\nMaximize: Profit = 10x + 8y\nSubject to:\nx ≥ 30\ny ≥ 40\n\nUsing a linear programming solver or graphical method, we find that the optimal solution is x = 30 and y = 40. This means that the company should produce 30 units of product A and 40 units of product B to maximize their expected profit while minimizing the potential loss due to demand uncertainty.\n\nThe maximum profit in this case would be:\n\nProfit = 10(30) + 8(40) = 300 + 320 = $620"
