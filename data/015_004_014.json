    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is the region in the complex plane that is connected to the origin. The area of the main cardioid can be approximated using the formula for the area of a cardioid:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * R^2\n\nIn this case, the radius R is 2, so the area of the main cardioid is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * (2^2) = 2π\n\nThe number of iterations does not affect the area of the main cardioid, so after 100 iterations, the area remains the same:\n\nArea ≈ 2π ≈ 6.283 square units"
