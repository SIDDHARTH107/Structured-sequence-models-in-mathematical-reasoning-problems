In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}.\n\nNow, let's verify that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nFor set A:\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\nSince all elements of A are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nFor set B:\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\nSince all elements of B are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} is a superset of both A and B."
