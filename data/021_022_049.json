    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit for each unit of Product A is \\$6 and for Product B is \\$4. The factory has a maximum capacity of producing 100 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B per day. The factory needs at least 5 employees to operate and the maximum number of employees available is 15. Write a program to find the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize the profit, using the firefly algorithm.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of fireflies. In this case, we will use it to find the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to maximize the profit. Here's a Python program that implements the firefly algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\n# Objective function to maximize profit\ndef profit(x):\n    return 6 * x[0] + 4 * x[1]\n\n# Constraints\ndef constraints(x):\n    return (x[0] >= 0 and x[1] >= 0 and\n            x[0] <= 100 and x[1] <= 150 and\n            5 <= x[0] + x[1] <= 15)\n\n# Firefly algorithm parameters\nn_fireflies = 50\nn_iterations = 100\nalpha = 0.5\nbeta0 = 1\ngamma = 0.5\n\n# Initialize fireflies\nfireflies = [np.array([random.randint(0, 100), random.randint(0, 150)]) for _ in range(n_fireflies)]\n\n# Main loop\nfor _ in range(n_iterations):\n    for i in range(n_fireflies):\n        for j in range(n_fireflies):\n            if profit(fireflies[j]) > profit(fireflies[i]) and constraints(fireflies[j]):\n                r = np.linalg.norm(fireflies[i] - fireflies[j])\n                beta = beta0 * np.exp(-gamma * r ** 2)\n                fireflies[i] += beta * (fireflies[j] - fireflies[i]) + alpha * (random.random() - 0.5)\n                fireflies[i] = np.clip(fireflies[i], 0, 150)\n                fireflies[i][0] = min(fireflies[i][0], 100)\n\n# Find the best solution\nbest_firefly = max(fireflies, key=profit)\nprint(\"Optimal number of units of Product A:\", int(best_firefly[0]))\nprint(\"Optimal number of units of Product B:\", int(best_firefly[1]))\nprint(\"Maximum profit:\", profit(best_firefly))\n```\n\nThis program initializes a population of fireflies and iteratively updates their positions based on the profit and constraints. The best solution is found after a specified number of iterations. Note that the firefly algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution found may not always be the global optimum. You can adjust the parameters and number of iterations to improve the solution quality."
