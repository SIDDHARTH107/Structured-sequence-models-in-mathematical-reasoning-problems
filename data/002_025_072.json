    "message_2": "Since the triangle has two sides equal in length, it is an isosceles triangle. Let's denote the equal sides as a and a (both 5 cm), and the third side as b. The angle between the equal sides is 60 degrees.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side, b:\n\nb^2 = a^2 + a^2 - 2 * a * a * cos(60)\n\nb^2 = 5^2 + 5^2 - 2 * 5 * 5 * cos(60)\n\nSince cos(60) = 1/2, the equation becomes:\n\nb^2 = 25 + 25 - 2 * 5 * 5 * (1/2)\n\nb^2 = 50 - 25\n\nb^2 = 25\n\nb = âˆš25\n\nb = 5 cm\n\nThe length of the third side is 5 centimeters."
