    "message_1": "In a basketball game, the probability of a player making a free throw is 0.8. If the player takes 10 free throws, what is the probability that they will make exactly 7 of them?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10 free throws)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 7 successful free throws)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.8)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.2)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 successful free throws out of 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\nC(10, 7) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.8^7 * 0.2^3\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.8^7 * 0.2^3\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.2097152 * 0.008\nP(X = 7) â‰ˆ 0.201326592\n\nSo, the probability of the player making exactly 7 out of 10 free throws is approximately 0.201 or 20.1%."
