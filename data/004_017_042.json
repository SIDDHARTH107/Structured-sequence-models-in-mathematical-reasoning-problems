    "message_2": "To find the length of the arc of the curve y = x^2/2 between x = 0 and x = 4, we can use the arc length formula for a function:\n\nArc length = ∫[sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2)] dx from a to b\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^2/2\ndy/dx = d(x^2/2)/dx = x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nArc length = ∫[sqrt(1 + x^2)] dx from 0 to 4\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's use the substitution:\n\nu = x\ndu/dx = 1\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nArc length = ∫[sqrt(1 + u^2)] du from 0 to 4\n\nThis integral can be solved using a trigonometric substitution:\n\nu = sinh(t)\ndu/dt = cosh(t)\n\nArc length = ∫[sqrt(1 + sinh^2(t))] cosh(t) dt from t1 to t2\n\nSince u = sinh(t), we need to find the corresponding t values for u = 0 and u = 4:\n\nu = 0: sinh(t1) = 0 => t1 = 0 (since sinh(0) = 0)\nu = 4: sinh(t2) = 4 => t2 = arcsinh(4)\n\nNow we can rewrite the integral with the new limits:\n\nArc length = ∫[sqrt(1 + sinh^2(t))] cosh(t) dt from 0 to arcsinh(4)\n\nWe know that cosh^2(t) - sinh^2(t) = 1, so:\n\nArc length = ∫[cosh^2(t)] dt from 0 to arcsinh(4)\n\nNow, we can use the identity for cosh(2t) = 2cosh^2(t) - 1:\n\ncosh^2(t) = (cosh(2t) + 1)/2\n\nArc length = ∫[(cosh(2t) + 1)/2] dt from 0 to arcsinh(4)\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nArc length = (1/2)∫[cosh(2t)] dt + (1/2)∫[1] dt from 0 to arcsinh(4)\n\nArc length = (1/4)sinh(2t) + (1/2)t | from 0 to arcsinh(4)\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits:\n\nArc length = (1/4)sinh(2*arcsinh(4)) + (1/2)arcsinh(4) - (1/4)sinh(0) - (1/2)(0)\n\nArc length = (1/4)sinh(2*arcsinh(4)) + (1/2)arcsinh(4)\n\nNow, we can use the identity sinh(2*arcsinh(x)) = 2x*sqrt(1 + x^2):\n\nArc length = (1/4)(2*4*sqrt(1 + 4^2)) + (1/2)arcsinh(4)\n\nArc length = (1/2)(16*sqrt(17)) + (1/2)arcsinh(4)\n\nArc length ≈ 34.0545\n\nSo, the length of the arc of the curve y = x^2/2 between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 34.0545 units."
