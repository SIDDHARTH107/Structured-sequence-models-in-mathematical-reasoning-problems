    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) which is 3x:\n\n3x(x^2 + 3x - 2)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. To do this, we look for two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to 3. These numbers are 2 and -1. So, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as:\n\nx^2 + 2x - x - 2\n\nNow, we can factor by grouping:\n\nx(x + 2) - 1(x + 2)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common binomial factor (x + 2):\n\n(x + 2)(x - 1)\n\nFinally, we can put back the 3x we factored out at the beginning:\n\n3x(x + 2)(x - 1)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 3x^3 + 9x^2 - 6x is 3x(x + 2)(x - 1)."
