    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of C1 and C2, we can solve the system of equations formed by their equations. First, we can express y in terms of x from the equation of C2:\n\ny = 2 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the equation of C1:\n\nx^2 + (2 - x)^2 = 5\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n\nx^2 + 4 - 4x + x^2 = 5\n2x^2 - 4x - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. To find the solutions for x, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -4, and c = -1:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(2)(-1))) / (2 * 2)\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 8)) / 4\nx = (4 ± √24) / 4\n\nThe two solutions for x are:\n\nx1 = (4 + √24) / 4\nx2 = (4 - √24) / 4\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding y values by substituting these x values back into the equation y = 2 - x:\n\ny1 = 2 - x1 = 2 - (4 + √24) / 4 = (8 - 4 - √24) / 4 = (4 - √24) / 4\ny2 = 2 - x2 = 2 - (4 - √24) / 4 = (8 - 4 + √24) / 4 = (4 + √24) / 4\n\nSo, the intersection points are:\n\nP1 = (x1, y1) = ((4 + √24) / 4, (4 - √24) / 4)\nP2 = (x2, y2) = ((4 - √24) / 4, (4 + √24) / 4)\n\nSince both C1 and C2 are non-singular curves with degrees 2 and 1, respectively, and they intersect at two distinct points, we can apply Bezout's theorem. The product of their degrees is 2 * 1 = 2, which means that the total number of intersection points, taking into account their multiplicities, is 2. In this case, both intersection points have multiplicity 1, so the answer is 2."
