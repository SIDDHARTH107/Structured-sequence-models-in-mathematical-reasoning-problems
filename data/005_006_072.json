    "message_1": "Suppose the mean height of students at a certain university is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 5 cm. If a random sample of 36 students is selected, what is the probability that the mean height of this sample will be less than 168 cm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the population mean (μ) is 170 cm and the population standard deviation (σ) is 5 cm. We are also given a sample size (n) of 36 students.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nSE = 5 / √36 = 5 / 6 = 0.8333 cm\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 168 cm. To do this, we can use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SE\n\nwhere X is the sample mean we are interested in (168 cm in this case). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (168 - 170) / 0.8333 = -2 / 0.8333 ≈ -2.4\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.4. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability. Looking up -2.4 in a z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.0082.\n\nSo, the probability that the mean height of a random sample of 36 students is less than 168 cm is approximately 0.82%."
