    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in this network, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or simply analyze the capacities of the edges.\n\nThe flow from A to B can take two paths: A -> B directly or A -> B through the edge from B to A.\n\n1. If the flow goes directly from A to B, it is limited by the capacity of the edge A -> B, which is 4.\n\n2. If the flow goes from A to B through the edge from B to A, it first goes from A to B with a capacity of 4, then from B to A with a capacity of 6, and finally from A to B again with a capacity of 5. In this case, the flow is limited by the minimum capacity in the path, which is 4 (A -> B).\n\nSo, in both cases, the maximum flow from A to B is 4."
