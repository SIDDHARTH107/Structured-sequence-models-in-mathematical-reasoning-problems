    "message_1": "Consider a population of rabbits that is initially 10 and is growing at a rate proportional to the population size. If the growth rate is estimated to be 0.5 per month, what will be the population size after 6 months? Use a differential equation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the differential equation for exponential growth:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population size, t is time (in months), and k is the growth rate (0.5 per month).\n\nFirst, we need to solve this differential equation. We can rewrite it as:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(dP/P) = ∫(k dt)\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition that P(0) = 10:\n\nln(10) = 0.5 * 0 + C\n\nC = ln(10)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = 0.5t + ln(10)\n\nTo find the population size after 6 months, we can plug in t = 6:\n\nln(P) = 0.5 * 6 + ln(10)\n\nln(P) = 3 + ln(10)\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to solve for P:\n\nP = e^(3 + ln(10))\n\nP = e^3 * e^ln(10)\n\nP = e^3 * 10\n\nP ≈ 20.0855 * 10\n\nP ≈ 200.855\n\nAfter 6 months, the population size will be approximately 200.855 rabbits."
