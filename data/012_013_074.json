    "message_2": "A graph with 4 vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex, is known as a complete graph with 4 vertices, denoted as K4. The chromatic polynomial of a graph is a polynomial that counts the number of proper colorings of the graph using k colors.\n\nFor a complete graph K_n, the chromatic polynomial is given by:\n\nP(K_n, k) = k(k-1)^{n-1}\n\nIn our case, n = 4, so the chromatic polynomial of the graph G (K4) is:\n\nP(K4, k) = k(k-1)^{4-1} = k(k-1)^3"
