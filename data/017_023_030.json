    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nThe order of G is 72, which has prime factorization 2^3 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide the order of G and satisfy certain congruences.\n\nFor n_2, we have the following possibilities:\n1. n_2 = 1 (mod 2) and n_2 divides 9, so n_2 can be 1 or 9.\n2. n_3 = 1 (mod 3) and n_3 divides 8, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIf both n_2 and n_3 are 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. These subgroups are normal in G, and their intersection is trivial since their orders are coprime. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of these subgroups, and G is isomorphic to C8 × C9. Since C8 × C9 is isomorphic to C72, in this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C72.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. However, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, so G cannot be a simple group. This case rules out the possibility of G being isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, as A4 × C3 × C2 is a simple group.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nSimilar to case 2, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. However, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, so G cannot be a simple group. This case also rules out the possibility of G being isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. This case does not provide enough information to determine the structure of G, but it is possible that G is isomorphic to one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C72 if it has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. G cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, as this group is simple and the Sylow subgroups of G do not satisfy the conditions for a simple group. Finally, G may be isomorphic to one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, particularly in the case where n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4."
