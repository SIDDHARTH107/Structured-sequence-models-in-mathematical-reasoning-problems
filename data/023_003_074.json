    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first need to find the Fourier sine series representation of the initial condition u(0, x) = 2x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. The Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nu(0, x) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L, and L = 1 in this case.\n\nSo, B_n = 2 * ∫[2x * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1.\n\nIntegrating by parts, we have:\n\nu = 2x, dv = sin(nπx) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-(2x/nπ) * cos(nπx)] from 0 to 1 + (1/nπ) * ∫[2 * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1)\n\nNow, integrating the second term:\n\n∫[2 * cos(nπx) dx] = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx) from 0 to 1\n\nSo, B_n = 2 * ([-(2x/nπ) * cos(nπx)] from 0 to 1 + [(2/nπ) * sin(nπx)] from 0 to 1)\n\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-(2/nπ) * cos(nπ)] + 0)\n\nNow, cos(nπ) = (-1)^n, so:\n\nB_n = (4/nπ) * (-1)^(n+1)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier sine series representation of the initial condition:\n\nu(0, x) = ∑[(4/nπ) * (-1)^(n+1) * sin(nπx)]\n\nNext, we need to find the solution u(t, x) for t > 0. Since the given PDE is a heat equation, the solution can be represented as:\n\nu(t, x) = ∑[B_n * e^(-n^2π^2kt) * sin(nπx)]\n\nwhere k = 9 (given in the problem) and B_n is the Fourier coefficient we found earlier.\n\nSo, the solution u(t, x) for t > 0 is:\n\nu(t, x) = ∑[(4/nπ) * (-1)^(n+1) * e^(-9n^2π^2t) * sin(nπx)]"
