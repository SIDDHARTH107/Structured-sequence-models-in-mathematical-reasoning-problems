    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular octagon with a side length of 5 cm, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = 2 * (1 + √2) * (side length)^2\n\nPlugging in the given side length:\n\nArea = 2 * (1 + √2) * (5 cm)^2\nArea = 2 * (1 + √2) * 25 cm^2\nArea = 50 * (1 + √2) cm^2\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of √2 as 1.414:\n\nArea ≈ 50 * (1 + 1.414) cm^2\nArea ≈ 50 * 2.414 cm^2\nArea ≈ 120.7 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the regular octagon is approximately 120.7 square centimeters."
