    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is not a subtopic of Mathematics. It is a branch of Philosophy that deals with the logic of obligation, permission, and related concepts. Therefore, it does not involve numerical problems that can be solved by a math student. If you have any other topic in Mathematics, please let me know so I can assist you further.",
    "message_2": "Please provide a mathematical problem or topic for me to help you with."
