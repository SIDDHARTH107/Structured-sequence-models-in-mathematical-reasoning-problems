    "message_1": "Consider a communication network where the signal is given by f(t) = cos(2πt) + sin(4πt) + cos(8πt). Use Fourier analysis to determine the frequency components of the signal and write the Fourier series of the signal. Specifically, find the amplitude and phase of each frequency component.",
    "message_2": "The given signal is f(t) = cos(2πt) + sin(4πt) + cos(8πt). This signal is already in the time domain and can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal functions. Therefore, we can directly identify the frequency components and their amplitudes and phases.\n\n1. The first term is cos(2πt). The frequency component is 2π (or 1 Hz), the amplitude is 1, and the phase is 0 (since it's a cosine function).\n\n2. The second term is sin(4πt). The frequency component is 4π (or 2 Hz), the amplitude is 1, and the phase is π/2 (since it's a sine function).\n\n3. The third term is cos(8πt). The frequency component is 8π (or 4 Hz), the amplitude is 1, and the phase is 0 (since it's a cosine function).\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series of the signal as:\n\nf(t) = A1*cos(2πt + φ1) + A2*cos(4πt + φ2) + A3*cos(8πt + φ3)\n\nwhere A1 = A3 = 1, A2 = 1, φ1 = φ3 = 0, and φ2 = π/2.\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the signal is:\n\nf(t) = cos(2πt) + sin(4πt) + cos(8πt)\n\nThe amplitude and phase of each frequency component are as follows:\n\n1. Frequency component 1 Hz: Amplitude = 1, Phase = 0\n2. Frequency component 2 Hz: Amplitude = 1, Phase = π/2\n3. Frequency component 4 Hz: Amplitude = 1, Phase = 0"
