Suppose that the critical points of $f$ are of index $0,1,$ and $2$. Let $n_i$ denote the number of critical points of index $i$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. Show that\n$$\nn_0 - n_1 + n_2 = \\chi(S),\n$$\nwhere $\\chi(S)=2 - 2g - k$ is the Euler characteristic of $S$. \n\nIf $S$ is a torus ($g=1$, $k=0$), and $f$ is a smooth map that is transverse to all non-critical points such that the critical points of $f$ are of index $0,1,$ and $2$, then compute the possible values of $n_0 - n_1 + n_2$.",
    "message_2": "We will use Morse theory to prove the result. Recall that for a smooth function $f: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with non-degenerate critical points, we can construct a CW complex with one $i$-cell for each critical point of index $i$. The Euler characteristic of this CW complex is equal to the Euler characteristic of the original manifold $S$.\n\nIn our case, we have a smooth map $f: S \\to S^1$ with critical points of index $0,1,$ and $2$. We can consider the preimage of a regular value in $S^1$ under $f$, which is a collection of disjoint circles. By choosing a small neighborhood around this regular value, we can construct a Morse function $g: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g$ has the same critical points as $f$ with the same indices. This is because the local behavior of $f$ near its critical points is determined by the index of the critical points, and we can find a Morse function $g$ that has the same local behavior.\n\nNow, we can construct a CW complex for the Morse function $g$ with one $i$-cell for each critical point of index $i$. The Euler characteristic of this CW complex is given by\n$$\n\\chi(S) = n_0 - n_1 + n_2.\n$$\n\nSince the Euler characteristic of $S$ is also given by $\\chi(S) = 2 - 2g - k$, we have\n$$\nn_0 - n_1 + n_2 = 2 - 2g - k.\n$$\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $S$ is a torus ($g=1$, $k=0$). In this case, the Euler characteristic of $S$ is given by $\\chi(S) = 2 - 2(1) - 0 = 0$. Therefore, we have\n$$\nn_0 - n_1 + n_2 = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $n_0, n_1,$ and $n_2$ are non-negative integers, the possible values for $n_0 - n_1 + n_2$ are $0$."
