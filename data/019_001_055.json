    "message_1": "If p represents the statement \"2 is divisible by 3\" and q represents the statement \"5 is a prime number,\" what is the truth value of the statement \"p implies q\"? (Assign the value of 1 for True and 0 for False).",
    "message_2": "The statement \"p implies q\" can be written as \"if p, then q.\" In this case, p is false because 2 is not divisible by 3, and q is true because 5 is a prime number. In logic, \"if false, then true\" is considered true. Therefore, the truth value of the statement \"p implies q\" is 1 (True)."
