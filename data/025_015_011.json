    "message_2": "To solve for \"z\" in the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3-3xyz=0$, we can first isolate the terms containing \"z\" on one side of the equation:\n\n$z^3 - 3xyz = -x^3 - y^3$\n\nNow, we can factor out \"z\" from the left side of the equation:\n\n$z(z^2 - 3xy) = -x^3 - y^3$\n\nNext, we can divide both sides of the equation by $(z^2 - 3xy)$ to solve for \"z\":\n\n$z = \\frac{-x^3 - y^3}{z^2 - 3xy}$\n\nThis equation represents the algebraic surface in terms of \"x\" and \"y\". Note that this equation is not fully explicit, as \"z\" still appears in the denominator. However, this is the best we can do to express \"z\" in terms of \"x\" and \"y\" for this particular algebraic surface."
