    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two, specifically in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a prime number. The first six Mersenne primes are M_2, M_3, M_5, M_7, M_13, and M_17, which correspond to the prime numbers 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, and 131071, respectively.\n\nThe 7th Mersenne prime is M_19 = 2^19 - 1 = 524287."
