    "message_2": "To solve the equation log₂(x-1) + log₂(x+2) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that logₐ(m) + logₐ(n) = logₐ(mn) for any positive real numbers m, n, and a.\n\nApplying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog₂((x-1)(x+2)) = 3\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that a^(logₐ(m)) = m. In this case, we have:\n\n2^(log₂((x-1)(x+2))) = 2^3\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(x-1)(x+2) = 8\n\nExpanding the left side, we have:\n\nx^2 + 2x - x - 2 = 8\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nx^2 + x - 10 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is the easiest method:\n\n(x-2)(x+5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get two possible solutions for x:\n\nx-2 = 0 => x = 2\nx+5 = 0 => x = -5\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid in the original equation, since logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. \n\nFor x = 2:\n\nlog₂(2-1) + log₂(2+2) = log₂(1) + log₂(4) = 0 + 2 ≠ 3\n\nSo, x = 2 is not a valid solution.\n\nFor x = -5:\n\nlog₂(-5-1) + log₂(-5+2) = log₂(-6) + log₂(-3)\n\nBoth arguments are negative, so this solution is also not valid.\n\nTherefore, there are no valid solutions for x in the given equation."
