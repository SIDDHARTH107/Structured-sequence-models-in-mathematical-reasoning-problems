    "message_1": "What is the number of possible keys for a block cipher with a block size of 64 bits if it uses a key schedule that generates a round key for each of the 16 rounds from an original key of 128 bits?",
    "message_2": "The number of possible keys for a block cipher with an original key of 128 bits is determined by the key size, not the block size. Since the key size is 128 bits, there are 2^128 possible keys. Therefore, the number of possible keys for this block cipher is:\n\n2^128 â‰ˆ 3.4 x 10^38 keys"
