    "message_2": "A birational morphism between two varieties is a morphism that is defined almost everywhere and has an inverse morphism defined almost everywhere. In the case of a non-singular cubic surface X in P³, we can determine whether there exists a birational morphism to a projective plane P² by examining the properties of X.\n\nFirst, let's consider the dimension of X and P². Since X is a cubic surface in P³, it has dimension 2. The projective plane P² also has dimension 2. This means that a birational morphism between X and P² is possible, as they have the same dimension.\n\nNext, let's consider the degree of X. Since X is a non-singular cubic surface, it has degree 3. A projective plane P² has degree 1. In order for a birational morphism to exist between X and P², there must be a correspondence between the points of X and the points of P². This correspondence is given by the intersection of X with a linear space L in P³.\n\nNow, let's find the inverse image of a line L⊂P² on X. Since X is a cubic surface, the intersection of X with a linear space L in P³ will be a curve of degree 3. This curve will be the inverse image of the line L⊂P² on X.\n\nTo summarize, there exists a birational morphism from a non-singular cubic surface X in P³ to a projective plane P². The inverse image of a line L⊂P² on X is given by the intersection of X with a linear space L in P³, which is a curve of degree 3."
