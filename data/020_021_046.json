    "message_1": "A company has four employees and wants to schedule their workweek in such a way that the total number of hours worked is minimized. Each employee must work a total of 40 hours over the course of the week, and there are no constraints on the number of hours any employee can work on a single day. The following table shows how many hours each employee is available to work on each day of the week:\n\n|         | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Employee 1 |  8  |  6  |  8  |  0  |  6  |\n| Employee 2 |  0  |  5  |  8  |  5  |  0  |\n| Employee 3 |  8  |  0  |  0  |  8  |  8  |\n| Employee 4 |  8  |  8  |  0  |  0  |  8  |\n\nWhat is the optimal schedule for the employees to minimize the total number of hours worked?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total number of hours worked, we should assign each employee to work the maximum number of hours they are available on each day. The optimal schedule would be:\n\n|         | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Total |\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Employee 1 |  8  |  6  |  8  |  0  |  6  |  28  |\n| Employee 2 |  0  |  5  |  8  |  5  |  0  |  18  |\n| Employee 3 |  8  |  0  |  0  |  8  |  8  |  24  |\n| Employee 4 |  8  |  8  |  0  |  0  |  8  |  24  |\n\nHowever, this schedule only gives a total of 94 hours, and we need a total of 160 hours (40 hours per employee). To achieve this, we can distribute the remaining hours as follows:\n\n- Employee 1 needs 12 more hours: Add 6 hours on Tue and 6 hours on Fri.\n- Employee 2 needs 22 more hours: Add 5 hours on Tue, 8 hours on Wed, 5 hours on Thu, and 4 hours on Fri.\n- Employee 3 needs 16 more hours: Add 8 hours on Mon and 8 hours on Fri.\n- Employee 4 needs 16 more hours: Add 8 hours on Mon and 8 hours on Tue.\n\nThe optimal schedule would then be:\n\n|         | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Total |\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Employee 1 |  8  | 12  |  8  |  0  | 12  |  40  |\n| Employee 2 |  0  | 10  | 16  | 10  |  4  |  40  |\n| Employee 3 | 16  |  0  |  0  |  8  | 16  |  40  |\n| Employee 4 | 16  | 16  |  0  |  0  |  8  |  40  |\n\nThis schedule ensures that each employee works 40 hours per week, and the total number of hours worked is minimized."
