    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, we will apply the Newton-Raphson formula iteratively until we reach the desired accuracy of 4 decimal places. The formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe start with the initial guess x0 = 2:\n\n1st iteration:\nx1 = 2 - (2^3 - 2*2 - 5) / (3*(2^2) - 2)\nx1 = 2 - (8 - 4 - 5) / (12 - 2)\nx1 = 2 - (-1) / 10\nx1 = 2.1\n\n2nd iteration:\nx2 = 2.1 - (2.1^3 - 2*2.1 - 5) / (3*(2.1^2) - 2)\nx2 ≈ 2.0946\n\n3rd iteration:\nx3 = 2.0946 - (2.0946^3 - 2*2.0946 - 5) / (3*(2.0946^2) - 2)\nx3 ≈ 2.094551\n\nSince the difference between x2 and x3 is less than 0.0001, we can stop here. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5, accurate to 4 decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 2.0946."
