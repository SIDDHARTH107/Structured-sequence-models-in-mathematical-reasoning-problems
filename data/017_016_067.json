    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or to the non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, we have that |G| = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, so n_3 divides 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, since n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3, the only possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup of G. Let P be this unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9 and G has order 27, by the Sylow theorems, G is the internal direct product of P and a subgroup of order 3. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 27\nIf there are 27 Sylow 3-subgroups, then G cannot be a simple group, as there must be a normal subgroup of G. However, there is no non-abelian group of order 27, so this case is not possible.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27."
