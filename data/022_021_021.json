    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s), we first need to perform partial fraction decomposition on F(s). The denominator of F(s) can be factored as follows:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 3 = (s + 1)(s + 3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite F(s) as:\n\nF(s) = A / (s + 1) + B / (s + 3)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation by (s + 1)(s + 3):\n\n(3s + 5) = A(s + 3) + B(s + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in values of s that will eliminate one of the constants. Let's start with s = -1:\n\n3(-1) + 5 = A(-1 + 3) + B(-1 + 1)\n2 = 2A\nA = 1\n\nNow, let's plug in s = -3:\n\n3(-3) + 5 = A(-3 + 1) + B(-3 + 3)\n-4 = -2A\nA = 2\n\nHowever, we made an error in our previous calculation for A. Let's correct it:\n\n3(-1) + 5 = A(-1 + 3) + B(-1 + 1)\n2 = 2A\nA = 1\n\nNow we have the correct values for A and B:\n\nF(s) = 1 / (s + 1) + 2 / (s + 3)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) by using the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\nf(t) = L^(-1){1 / (s + 1)} + L^(-1){2 / (s + 3)}\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform property, we know that:\n\nL^(-1){1 / (s + a)} = e^(-at)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf(t) = e^(-1t) + 2e^(-3t)\n\nThus, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is:\n\nf(t) = e^(-t) + 2e^(-3t)"
