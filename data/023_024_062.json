    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 1/x on the interval -π < x < π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, we know that a_n = 0 for all n. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of a function is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nFor an odd function, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients using the formula:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx, integrated from -π to π\n\nFor f(x) = 1/x, we have:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[(1/x) * sin(n * x)] dx, integrated from -π to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 1/x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\nThen, du = -1/x^2 dx, v = -cos(n * x)/n\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/x) * (-cos(n * x)/n) - ∫ (-cos(n * x)/n) * (-1/x^2) dx], integrated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/x) * (-cos(n * x)/n) + (1/n) * ∫ (cos(n * x)/x^2) dx], integrated from -π to π\n\nThe first term in the brackets vanishes when evaluated at the limits -π and π. So, we are left with:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (1/n) * ∫ (cos(n * x)/x^2) dx, integrated from -π to π\n\nThis integral is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use the result of a known integral:\n\n∫ (cos(n * x)/x) dx = (1/2) * (Ci(n * x) * sin(n * x) - Si(n * x) * cos(n * x)) + C\n\nwhere Ci(x) is the cosine integral function and Si(x) is the sine integral function.\n\nNow, we can rewrite our integral as:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (1/n) * ∫ (cos(n * x)/x^2) dx = (1/π) * (1/n) * d/dx [∫ (cos(n * x)/x) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (1/n) * d/dx [(1/2) * (Ci(n * x) * sin(n * x) - Si(n * x) * cos(n * x))], evaluated from -π to π\n\nThe derivative of the above expression with respect to x is quite complicated, and the resulting expression for b_n may not be easily simplified. However, we can still write the Fourier series for f(x) = 1/x using the b_n coefficients:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(1/π) * (1/n) * d/dx [(1/2) * (Ci(n * x) * sin(n * x) - Si(n * x) * cos(n * x))]] * sin(n * x)\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = 1/x on the interval -π < x < π, with the understanding that f(x) is periodic with period 2π and has a periodic discontinuity at x=0."
