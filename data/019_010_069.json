    "message_2": "In linear logic, the formula A ⊸ ¬B can be read as \"A implies not B.\" To evaluate this formula when A is true and B is false, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n\nTrue ⊸ ¬False\n\nIn classical logic, ¬False is equivalent to True. Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nTrue ⊸ True\n\nIn linear logic, A ⊸ B is true if either A is false or B is true. In this case, both A and B are true, so the formula evaluates to:\n\nTrue\n\nThus, the formula A ⊸ ¬B is true when A is true and B is false."
