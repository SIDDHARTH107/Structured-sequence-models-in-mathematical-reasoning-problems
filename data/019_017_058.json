    "message_1": "Consider the language of group theory with a single binary function symbol,  * , and a single unary function symbol,  -  . Let N be a structure whose domain is the set of all natural numbers, whose binary operation is the usual multiplication of numbers, and whose unary operation is the negative of a number. Determine whether the following statement is true or false in the structure N:\n\n∀x ∀y ∀z (x*y)*z=x*(y*z)",
    "message_2": "The given statement is:\n\n∀x ∀y ∀z (x*y)*z=x*(y*z)\n\nThis statement is an expression of the associative property of multiplication. The associative property states that for any three numbers, the result of their multiplication does not depend on the grouping of the numbers. In other words, the order in which the numbers are multiplied does not affect the result.\n\nIn the structure N, where the domain is the set of all natural numbers, and the binary operation is the usual multiplication of numbers, the associative property holds true. This is because the multiplication of natural numbers is associative.\n\nTherefore, the statement ∀x ∀y ∀z (x*y)*z=x*(y*z) is true in the structure N."
