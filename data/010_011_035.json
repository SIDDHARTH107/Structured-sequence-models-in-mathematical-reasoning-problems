    "message_2": "A smooth closed surface of genus two is a 2-dimensional manifold that can be obtained by attaching two \"handles\" or \"tori\" to a sphere. In this case, there is only one such surface, which is called a double torus or a surface of genus two.\n\nThe reason there is only one such surface is that the classification of closed surfaces depends only on their genus (the number of handles or tori attached). Two surfaces are homeomorphic if and only if they have the same genus. Since we are considering surfaces of genus two, there is only one non-homeomorphic smooth closed surface of genus two, which is the double torus itself."
