    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 12, and 20, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n8 = 2^3\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n20 = 2^2 * 5\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n2^3, 3^1, and 5^1\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120\n\nThe least common multiple of 8, 12, and 20 is 120."
