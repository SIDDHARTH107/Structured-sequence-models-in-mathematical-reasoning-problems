    "message_1": "A building is 50 meters tall. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 60 degrees. What is the distance from the base of the building to the point on the ground?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using trigonometry. We have a right triangle with the building as the height, the distance from the base of the building to the point on the ground as the base, and the angle of elevation as 60 degrees.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to find the distance from the base of the building to the point on the ground. The tangent function is defined as:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this case, the opposite side is the height of the building (50 meters), and the adjacent side is the distance from the base of the building to the point on the ground, which we'll call \"x\".\n\ntan(60°) = 50 / x\n\nTo find x, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 50 / tan(60°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of tan(60°), which is √3:\n\nx = 50 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\nx = (50 * √3) / (3)\n\nx ≈ 28.87 meters\n\nSo, the distance from the base of the building to the point on the ground is approximately 28.87 meters."
