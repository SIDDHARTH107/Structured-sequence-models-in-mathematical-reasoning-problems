    "message_2": "To find the median, first arrange the data in ascending order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nSince there are 8 numbers (an even amount) in the data set, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers. In this case, the middle numbers are 4 and 5.\n\nThe median is (4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5."
