    "message_2": "Let's denote the triangle as ΔABC, with side AB = 7, side AC = 10, and side BC = 12. We want to find the measures of angles ∠CAB (opposite side AB) and ∠ABC (opposite side AC).\n\nFirst, let's find the measure of angle ∠CAB using the Law of Cosines:\n\ncos(∠CAB) = (AC^2 + BC^2 - AB^2) / (2 * AC * BC)\ncos(∠CAB) = (10^2 + 12^2 - 7^2) / (2 * 10 * 12)\ncos(∠CAB) = (100 + 144 - 49) / 240\ncos(∠CAB) = 195 / 240\n∠CAB = arccos(195 / 240)\n\nNow, let's find the measure of angle ∠ABC using the Law of Cosines:\n\ncos(∠ABC) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos(∠ABC) = (7^2 + 12^2 - 10^2) / (2 * 7 * 12)\ncos(∠ABC) = (49 + 144 - 100) / 168\ncos(∠ABC) = 93 / 168\n∠ABC = arccos(93 / 168)\n\nNow, let's calculate the values of ∠CAB and ∠ABC:\n\n∠CAB ≈ arccos(195 / 240) ≈ 37.38°\n∠ABC ≈ arccos(93 / 168) ≈ 56.44°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side of length 7 is approximately 37.38°, and the measure of the angle opposite the side of length 10 is approximately 56.44°."
