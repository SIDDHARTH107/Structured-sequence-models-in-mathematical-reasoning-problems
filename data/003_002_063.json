    "message_2": "The value of tan 60° is √3. In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:√3:2, and the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. For a 60° angle, the opposite side is √3 and the adjacent side is 1, so the tangent is √3/1, which simplifies to √3."
