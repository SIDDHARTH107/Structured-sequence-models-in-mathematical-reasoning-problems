    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact surface S with boundary curve C, we have:\n\n∫∫_S K dA + ∫_C k_g ds = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, k_g is the geodesic curvature, and χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface S.\n\nGiven that the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 9, and the total geodesic curvature of the boundary curve C is 2π, we can rewrite the Gauss-Bonnet theorem as:\n\n9 * Area(S) + 2π = 2πχ(S)\n\nWe need to find the area of the surface S. Since the Gaussian curvature K is constant, we can use the formula for the area of a surface with constant Gaussian curvature:\n\nArea(S) = 2π(2 - χ(S))\n\nNow, substitute this expression for the area back into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n9 * 2π(2 - χ(S)) + 2π = 2πχ(S)\n\nDivide both sides by 2π:\n\n9(2 - χ(S)) + 1 = χ(S)\n\nExpand and rearrange the equation:\n\n18 - 9χ(S) + 1 = χ(S)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10χ(S) = 19\n\nNow, solve for the Euler characteristic χ(S):\n\nχ(S) = 19/10\n\nSince the Euler characteristic must be an integer, there is no valid solution for this problem. This indicates that there is an inconsistency in the given information, and it is not possible to have a surface with the specified constant Gaussian curvature and total geodesic curvature of the boundary curve."
