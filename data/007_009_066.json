    "message_2": "To find the value of 𝜙(105), we need to use the formula for Euler's totient function:\n\n𝜙(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factors of 105:\n\n105 = 3 * 5 * 7\n\nNow, we can plug these prime factors into the formula:\n\n𝜙(105) = 105 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 1/7)\n𝜙(105) = 105 * (2/3) * (4/5) * (6/7)\n𝜙(105) = (105 * 2 * 4 * 6) / (3 * 5 * 7)\n𝜙(105) = (1680) / (105)\n𝜙(105) = 48\n\nSo, the value of 𝜙(105) is 48."
