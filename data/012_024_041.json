    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a graph that may not be planar, we need to use the generalized formula for graphs embedded on surfaces of genus g:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g.\n\nWe are given that G has 12 vertices (V = 12) and 32 edges (E = 32). We need to find the genus g of the graph. To do this, we can first find the maximum number of edges a planar graph with 12 vertices can have using the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6.\n\nPlugging in V = 12, we get:\n\nE ≤ 3(12) - 6 = 30.\n\nSince G has 32 edges, which is more than the maximum number of edges for a planar graph with 12 vertices, G is not planar. Now we need to find the genus g of the graph.\n\nWe can rewrite the generalized Euler's formula as:\n\ng = 1 - (V - E + F)/2.\n\nSince we don't know the number of faces F, we can use the inequality for the maximum number of edges for a graph embedded on a surface of genus g:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6.\n\nPlugging in E = 32 and V = 12, we get:\n\n32 ≤ 3(12) + 6g - 6.\n\nSolving for g, we get:\n\n6g ≥ 32 - 3(12) + 6 = 2.\n\ng ≥ 1/3.\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, the smallest possible genus for G is g = 1. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 1."
