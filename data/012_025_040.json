    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph G.\n\nThe graph G can be represented as follows:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 3\n|    |    |\n4 -- 5 -- 6\n\nNow, let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle:\n\n1. Start at vertex 1.\n2. Move to vertex 2.\n3. Move to vertex 3.\n4. Move to vertex 4.\n5. Move to vertex 5.\n6. Move to vertex 6.\n7. Move back to vertex 1.\n\nThe Hamiltonian cycle is: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1)\n\nSo, the graph G has a Hamiltonian cycle."
