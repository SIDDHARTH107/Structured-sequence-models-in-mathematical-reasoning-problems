    "message_1": "A guitar string is 60 cm long and has a mass of 0.003 kg. The tension in the string is 400 N. What is the speed of the wave that travels along the string? Use the wave equation to solve the problem, assuming the string behaves elastically.",
    "message_2": "To find the speed of the wave that travels along the string, we can use the wave equation:\n\nv = √(T/μ)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the wave, T is the tension in the string, and μ is the linear mass density of the string.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the string. Linear mass density is defined as the mass per unit length:\n\nμ = mass/length\n\nGiven the mass of the string is 0.003 kg and the length is 60 cm (0.6 m), we can calculate μ:\n\nμ = 0.003 kg / 0.6 m = 0.005 kg/m\n\nNow, we can plug the values of tension (T) and linear mass density (μ) into the wave equation:\n\nv = √(400 N / 0.005 kg/m)\n\nv = √(80000 m²/s²)\n\nv = 282.84 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of the wave that travels along the string is approximately 282.84 m/s."
