    "message_1": "The Playfair cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters instead of single letters. If we use the Playfair cipher to encrypt the message \"MATHISFUN\" using the key \"CRYPTOLOGY\", what is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHISFUN\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTOLOGY\", we first need to create a 5x5 matrix using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: CRYPTOLOGY becomes CRYPTOLOG.\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, since I and J are treated as the same letter in the Playfair cipher) in the order they appear: CRYPTOLOGABDEFHIKMNQSUVWXZ.\n\nNow, we have the 5x5 matrix:\n\nC R Y P T\nO L O G A\nB D E F H\nI K M N Q\nS U V W X\nZ\n\nNext, we need to encrypt the message \"MATHISFUN\" using this matrix:\n\n1. Break the message into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them: MA TH IS FX UN.\n2. For each pair of letters, find their positions in the matrix and apply the Playfair rules:\n\n- If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if needed): MA -> OD, TH -> YP, IS -> KM, FX -> UV, UN -> ZS.\n- If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if needed): N/A.\n- If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other letter's column: N/A.\n\nThe encrypted message is: ODYPUVKMZS."
