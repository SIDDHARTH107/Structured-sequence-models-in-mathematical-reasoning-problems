    "message_2": "The given equation represents a 3-dimensional sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0, 0). The symmetries of this manifold are the rotations and reflections that preserve the sphere's shape and position.\n\nThe symmetries of the sphere can be described by the orthogonal group O(3), which consists of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant +1 (rotations) and -1 (reflections). The subgroup of O(3) that consists only of rotations is called the special orthogonal group, denoted as SO(3).\n\nNow, let's consider the rotations around the x-axis that preserve the manifold. A rotation matrix around the x-axis by an angle θ can be represented as:\n\nR_x(θ) = | 1    0         0    |\n         | 0  cos(θ) -sin(θ) |\n         | 0  sin(θ)  cos(θ) |\n\nSince the sphere is symmetric around the x-axis, any rotation by an angle θ around the x-axis will preserve the manifold. Therefore, there are infinitely many different rotations around the x-axis that preserve the manifold, as θ can take any value in the range [0, 2π)."
