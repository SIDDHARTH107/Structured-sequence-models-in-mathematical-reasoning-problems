    "message_2": "To find the time at which the car reaches a speed of 60 meters per second, we first need to find the velocity function, which is the derivative of the position function f(x).\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the time when the velocity is 60 meters per second. So, we will set f'(x) equal to 60 and solve for x:\n\n60 = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 - 60 = 0\n3x^2 - 12x - 51 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -12, and c = -51:\n\nx = (12 ± √((-12)^2 - 4(3)(-51))) / (2(3))\nx = (12 ± √(144 + 612)) / 6\nx = (12 ± √756) / 6\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx1 = (12 + √756) / 6\nx2 = (12 - √756) / 6\n\nSince time cannot be negative, we will only consider the positive solution:\n\nx1 = (12 + √756) / 6 ≈ 4.58\n\nSo, the car reaches a speed of 60 meters per second at approximately 4.58 seconds."
