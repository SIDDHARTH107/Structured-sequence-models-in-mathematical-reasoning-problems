    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set {} is a subset of set A.\n\nIn set theory, a set B is considered a subset of set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. In other words, for all x, if x ∈ B, then x ∈ A.\n\nTo prove that the empty set {} is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element of the empty set is also an element of set A. Since the empty set has no elements, there are no elements to check. This means that the condition \"for all x, if x ∈ {}, then x ∈ A\" is vacuously true, as there are no elements in the empty set that could potentially violate this condition.\n\nTherefore, the empty set {} is a subset of set A, as well as a subset of any other set."
