    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole of the given function f(z) = (z-1)/(z^2 + 2z + 5) at the point z = 2, we first need to check if z = 2 is indeed a pole of the function.\n\nA pole of a function is a point where the function becomes infinite due to the denominator being zero. In this case, we need to check if the denominator becomes zero at z = 2:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 5 = (2)^2 + 2(2) + 5 = 4 + 4 + 5 = 13\n\nSince the denominator does not become zero at z = 2, there is no pole at z = 2. Therefore, the order of the pole at z = 2 is not applicable, as there is no pole at this point."
