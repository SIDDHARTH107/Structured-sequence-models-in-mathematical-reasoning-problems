    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method in this case.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(2x + 3y) * 2 = 11 * 2\n4x + 6y = 22\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 22\n4x + 5y = 23\n\nNext, we will subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 5y) - (4x + 6y) = 23 - 22\n-1y = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = -1\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n2x + 3(-1) = 11\n2x - 3 = 11\n\nNow, add 3 to both sides:\n\n2x = 14\n\nFinally, divide by 2:\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 7 and y = -1."
