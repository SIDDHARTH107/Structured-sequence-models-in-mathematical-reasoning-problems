Compute the number of G-orbits on X.",
    "message_2": "To compute the number of G-orbits on X, we will first find the fixed points of the action of G on X and then use the Burnside's Lemma (also known as the Orbit Counting Theorem).\n\nRecall that Burnside's Lemma states that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group elements. In our case, G has 4 elements: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n1. For the identity element (0,0), all points on X are fixed, so there are |X| fixed points.\n\n2. For the element (0,1), the action interchanges the first two coordinates (x and y). The fixed points are those for which x = y. From the first equation, we have z = 3 - 2x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx^2 + x^2 + (3 - 2x)^2 = 5\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we find x = 1 and x = 2/3. Therefore, there are 2 fixed points for the element (0,1).\n\n3. Similarly, for the element (1,0), the action interchanges the last two coordinates (y and z). The fixed points are those for which y = z. From the first equation, we have x = 3 - 2y. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n(3 - 2y)^2 + y^2 + y^2 = 5\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we find y = 1 and y = 2/3. Therefore, there are 2 fixed points for the element (1,0).\n\n4. For the element (1,1), the action interchanges both the first two coordinates and the last two coordinates. The fixed points are those for which x = y = z. From the first equation, we have x = y = z = 1. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 5\n\nThis has no solutions, so there are 0 fixed points for the element (1,1).\n\nNow, we can use Burnside's Lemma to compute the number of G-orbits:\n\nNumber of G-orbits = (|X| + 2 + 2 + 0) / 4\n\nSince we don't know |X|, we can't compute the exact number of G-orbits. However, we can express the number of G-orbits in terms of |X|:\n\nNumber of G-orbits = (|X| + 4) / 4"
