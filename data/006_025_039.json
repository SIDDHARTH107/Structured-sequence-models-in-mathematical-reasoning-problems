    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of the clown falling exactly k times\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of stunts (10)\n- k is the number of falls (5 or more)\n- p is the probability of falling (0.6)\n- (1-p) is the probability of not falling (0.4)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of the clown falling at least 5 times, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 5 to k = 10.\n\nP(X >= 5) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + ... + P(X = 10)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and then sum them up:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(10, 5) * 0.6^5 * 0.4^5 = 252 * 0.07776 * 0.01024 ≈ 0.200658\nP(X = 6) = C(10, 6) * 0.6^6 * 0.4^4 = 210 * 0.046656 * 0.0256 ≈ 0.250822\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.6^7 * 0.4^3 = 120 * 0.0279936 * 0.064 ≈ 0.215046\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.6^8 * 0.4^2 = 45 * 0.01679616 * 0.16 ≈ 0.121550\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.6^9 * 0.4^1 = 10 * 0.010077696 * 0.4 ≈ 0.040311\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.6^10 * 0.4^0 = 1 * 0.006046618 * 1 ≈ 0.006047\n\nNow, sum the probabilities:\n\nP(X >= 5) = 0.200658 + 0.250822 + 0.215046 + 0.121550 + 0.040311 + 0.006047 ≈ 0.834434\n\nSo, the probability that the clown will fall during at least 5 stunts is approximately 0.834 or 83.4%."
