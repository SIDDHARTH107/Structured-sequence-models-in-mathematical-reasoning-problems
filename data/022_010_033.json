    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the given function, we first factor the numerator and denominator:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z-1)(z^2+z+1)}{(z-1)(z+4)}$\n\nNow, we can cancel the common factor $(z-1)$:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{z^2+z+1}{z+4}$\n\nNext, we perform a long division to get the partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$\\frac{z^2+z+1}{z+4} = 1 - \\frac{3z+3}{z+4}$\n\nNow, we want to find the Laurent series expansion centered at $z=1$. To do this, we rewrite the partial fraction decomposition in terms of $(z-1)$:\n\n$1 - \\frac{3z+3}{z+4} = 1 - \\frac{3(z-1)+3}{(z-1)+5}$\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula to find the Laurent series expansion:\n\n$1 - \\frac{3(z-1)+3}{(z-1)+5} = 1 - 3\\left(\\frac{z-1}{5}\\right) - \\frac{3}{z-1+5}$\n\n$= 1 - \\frac{3}{5}(z-1) - \\frac{3}{z-1+5}$\n\nNow, we can find the largest annulus within which the series converges. The series converges when the denominator is nonzero, i.e., $z-1+5 \\neq 0$. This condition is always satisfied, so the series converges for all $z \\neq 1$.\n\nThus, the Laurent series expansion of the function is:\n\n$f(z) = 1 - \\frac{3}{5}(z-1) - \\frac{3}{z-1+5}$\n\nAnd the largest annulus within which the series converges is:\n\n$0 < |z-1| < \\infty$"
