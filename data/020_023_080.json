The expected return rates and risk factors for each investment are given in the table below:\n\n| Investment | Expected Return Rate (%) | Risk Factor |\n|------------|-----------------------|-------------|\n| A          | 5                     | 2          |\n| B          | 7                     | 4          |\n| C          | 9                     | 5          |\n| D          | 10                    | 6          |\n\nAssuming that the total amount that can be invested is 100,000 dollars, and your risk aversion parameter is 0.03, what is the optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes the expected return subject to the risk constraint? What are the expected return rate and the risk factor of the optimal portfolio?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio allocation, we will use the concept of utility, which is the expected return minus the risk aversion parameter times the risk factor. The goal is to maximize the utility.\n\nLet x_A, x_B, x_C, and x_D be the allocation percentages for investments A, B, C, and D, respectively. The total allocation should be 100%, so:\n\nx_A + x_B + x_C + x_D = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is:\n\nE(R) = 5x_A + 7x_B + 9x_C + 10x_D\n\nThe risk factor of the portfolio is:\n\nRisk = 2x_A + 4x_B + 5x_C + 6x_D\n\nThe utility function is:\n\nU = E(R) - 0.03 * Risk\n\nSubstituting the expressions for E(R) and Risk, we get:\n\nU = (5x_A + 7x_B + 9x_C + 10x_D) - 0.03(2x_A + 4x_B + 5x_C + 6x_D)\n\nNow we need to maximize U subject to the constraint x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D = 1. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function L:\n\nL = (5x_A + 7x_B + 9x_C + 10x_D) - 0.03(2x_A + 4x_B + 5x_C + 6x_D) + λ(1 - x_A - x_B - x_C - x_D)\n\nNow we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x_A = 5 - 0.06 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂x_B = 7 - 0.12 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂x_C = 9 - 0.15 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂x_D = 10 - 0.18 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 1 - x_A - x_B - x_C - x_D = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n\nλ = 4.94\nx_A = 0\nx_B = 0.41\nx_C = 0.33\nx_D = 0.26\n\nSo the optimal portfolio allocation is 0% in A, 41% in B, 33% in C, and 26% in D.\n\nNow we can calculate the expected return rate and risk factor of the optimal portfolio:\n\nE(R) = 5(0) + 7(0.41) + 9(0.33) + 10(0.26) = 7.82%\n\nRisk = 2(0) + 4(0.41) + 5(0.33) + 6(0.26) = 4.47\n\nThe optimal portfolio has an expected return rate of 7.82% and a risk factor of 4.47."
