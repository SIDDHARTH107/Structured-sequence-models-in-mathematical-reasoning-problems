    "message_2": "To find the value of $X_1$, we can first rewrite the given stochastic differential equation using the Ito's lemma. Let $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$. Then, by Ito's lemma, we have:\n\n$$dY_t = \\frac{1}{X_t} dX_t - \\frac{1}{2X_t^2} (X_t dB_t)^2$$\n\nNow, substituting the given equation for $dX_t$:\n\n$$dY_t = \\frac{1}{X_t} (X_t dt + X_t dB_t) - \\frac{1}{2X_t^2} (X_t dB_t)^2$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$$dY_t = dt + dB_t - \\frac{1}{2} dB_t^2$$\n\nSince $dB_t^2 = dt$, we have:\n\n$$dY_t = dB_t$$\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides from 0 to 1:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 dY_t = \\int_0^1 dB_t$$\n\n$$Y_1 - Y_0 = B_1 - B_0$$\n\nSince $X_0 = 1$, we have $Y_0 = \\ln(1) = 0$. Also, $B_0 = 0$. Therefore:\n\n$$Y_1 = B_1$$\n\nNow, we can find $X_1$ by exponentiating both sides:\n\n$$X_1 = e^{Y_1} = e^{B_1}$$\n\nThe value of $X_1$ is a random variable given by $X_1 = e^{B_1}$, where $B_1$ is the standard Brownian motion at time $t=1$."
