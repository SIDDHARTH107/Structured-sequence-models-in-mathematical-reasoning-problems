    "message_2": "(a) To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y)$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$. Let's compute these partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 3x^2 + y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y + 2xy$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$2x - 3x^2 + y^2 = 0$\n\n$2y + 2xy = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can factor out $2y$:\n\n$2y(1 + x) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possibilities: $y = 0$ or $x = -1$. Let's consider each case separately.\n\nCase 1: $y = 0$\n\nSubstitute $y = 0$ into the first equation:\n\n$2x - 3x^2 = 0$\n\nFactor out $x$:\n\n$x(2 - 3x) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$.\n\nCase 2: $x = -1$\n\nSubstitute $x = -1$ into the first equation:\n\n$2(-1) - 3(-1)^2 + y^2 = 0$\n\n$-2 - 3 + y^2 = 0$\n\n$y^2 = 5$\n\nThis gives us two critical points: $(-1, \\sqrt{5})$ and $(-1, -\\sqrt{5})$.\n\nSo, the critical points of $f(x, y)$ are $(0, 0)$, $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$, $(-1, \\sqrt{5})$, and $(-1, -\\sqrt{5})$.\n\n(b) To determine the index of each critical point, we need to compute the Hessian matrix of $f(x, y)$, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives, and then evaluate it at each critical point. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2 - 6x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2 + 2x$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the Hessian matrix at each critical point and compute its index (the number of negative eigenvalues):\n\n1. $(0, 0)$:\n\n$H(f)(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues are 2 and 2, both positive, so the index is 0.\n\n2. $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$:\n\n$H(f)(\\frac{2}{3}, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{4}{3}\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues are -2 and $\\frac{4}{3}$, one negative and one positive, so the index is 1.\n\n3. $(-1, \\sqrt{5})$:\n\n$H(f)(-1, \\sqrt{5}) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 2\\sqrt{5} \\\\\n2\\sqrt{5} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues are $\\frac{1}{2}(4 + 4\\sqrt{5})$ and $\\frac{1}{2}(4 - 4\\sqrt{5})$, both positive, so the index is 0.\n\n4. $(-1, -\\sqrt{5})$:\n\n$H(f)(-1, -\\sqrt{5}) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & -2\\sqrt{5} \\\\\n-2\\sqrt{5} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues are the same as in the previous case, both positive, so the index is 0.\n\n(c) Using Morse theory, we can calculate the number of critical points of $f(x, y)$ with index less than or equal to 1. We found 4 critical points, and their indices are 0, 1, 0, and 0. Thus, there are 3 critical points with index less than or equal to 1."
