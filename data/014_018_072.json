    "message_1": "Suppose a substitution cipher is used to encrypt a message by replacing each letter with another letter. If the letter 'E' is replaced by 'T', and the letter 'T' is replaced by 'A', what letter or letters replace(s) the letter 'A'?",
    "message_2": "Since this is a substitution cipher, each letter is replaced by a unique different letter. We know that 'E' is replaced by 'T' and 'T' is replaced by 'A'. However, we do not have enough information to determine which specific letter replaces 'A'. It could be any of the remaining 24 letters in the alphabet, excluding 'A' and 'T'."
