The ends of the rod are kept at constant temperatures such that u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0 for all t.\n\nFind the solution u(x,t) for all x in [0,L] and t > 0.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, substitute this into the heat equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k ∂²u/∂x²\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = k T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nNow, divide both sides by kXT:\n\n(1/k) (∂T(t)/∂t) / T(t) = (∂²X(x)/∂x²) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/k) (∂T(t)/∂t) / T(t) = -λ²\n(∂²X(x)/∂x²) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. d²X(x)/dx² + λ²X(x) = 0, with boundary conditions X(0) = X(L) = 0\n2. dT(t)/dt + kλ²T(t) = 0\n\nFirst, let's solve the spatial equation (1). The general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A = 0 => X(x) = B*sin(λx)\nX(L) = B*sin(λL) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(λL) = 0. This implies that λL = nπ for some integer n. Thus, λ = nπ/L, and the spatial part of the solution is:\n\nX_n(x) = B_n*sin(nπx/L)\n\nNow, let's solve the temporal equation (2). This is a first-order linear ODE, and its general solution is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n*exp(-kλ²t) = C_n*exp(-k(nπ/L)²t)\n\nThe full solution u(x,t) is a sum of these spatial and temporal parts:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [B_n*sin(nπx/L) * C_n*exp(-k(nπ/L)²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n and C_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(πx/L):\n\nsin(πx/L) = Σ [B_n*sin(nπx/L) * C_n]\n\nSince this must hold for all x, we can see that only the n=1 term contributes to the sum, and all other terms are zero. Thus, B_1 = 1, C_1 = 1, and B_n = C_n = 0 for n ≠ 1.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(πx/L) * exp(-k(π/L)²t)"
