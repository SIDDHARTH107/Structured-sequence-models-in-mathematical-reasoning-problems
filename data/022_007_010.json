    "message_2": "According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial function of degree n will have exactly n complex roots, counting multiplicities. In this case, the given polynomial function is f(z) = z^4 + 3z^2 - 2, which has a degree of 4. Therefore, there are a total of 4 complex roots for this polynomial function."
