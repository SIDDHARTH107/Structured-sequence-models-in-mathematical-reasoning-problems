    "message_1": "A wave in a medium is governed by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = 4 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} - 4u\n$$\n\nwhere $u(x, t)$ is the displacement of the wave at position $x$ and time $t$. Find the general solution to this wave equation.",
    "message_2": "To find the general solution to this wave equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$$\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this into the wave equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 (X(x)T(t))}{\\partial t^2} = 4 \\frac{\\partial^2 (X(x)T(t))}{\\partial x^2} - 4X(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nNext, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)} \\frac{\\partial^2 T(t)}{\\partial t^2} = 4 \\frac{1}{X(x)} \\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2} - 4\n$$\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $-k^2$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)} \\frac{\\partial^2 T(t)}{\\partial t^2} = -k^2\n$$\n\n$$\n4 \\frac{1}{X(x)} \\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2} - 4 = -k^2\n$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T(t)}{\\partial t^2} = -k^2 T(t)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 X(x)}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{k^2}{4} X(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThe general solutions to these equations are:\n\n$$\nT(t) = A \\cos(kt) + B \\sin(kt)\n$$\n\n$$\nX(x) = C \\cosh(\\frac{k}{2}x) + D \\sinh(\\frac{k}{2}x)\n$$\n\nFinally, we combine these solutions to obtain the general solution to the wave equation:\n\n$$\nu(x, t) = (A \\cos(kt) + B \\sin(kt))(C \\cosh(\\frac{k}{2}x) + D \\sinh(\\frac{k}{2}x))\n$$\n\nwhere $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constants determined by initial and boundary conditions."
