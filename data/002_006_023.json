    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm. So, the circumference (C) can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2π(5 cm)\nC = 10π cm\n\nUsing the approximation of π as 3.14, the circumference is:\n\nC ≈ 10 × 3.14 cm\nC ≈ 31.4 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 31.4 cm."
