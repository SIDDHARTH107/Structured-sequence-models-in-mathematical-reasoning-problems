    "message_1": "A local farm has 600 acres of land available to grow two crops: corn and wheat. A bushel of corn requires 2 acres of land and 1 unit of fertilizers. A bushel of wheat requires 1 acre of land and 2 units of fertilizers. The farm has 1,000 units of fertilizers available. If the profit per bushel of corn is $4 and the profit per bushel of wheat is $6, how many bushels of each crop should the farm produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of bushels of corn and y be the number of bushels of wheat. We have the following constraints:\n\nLand constraint: 2x + y ≤ 600 (1)\nFertilizer constraint: x + 2y ≤ 1000 (2)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function, P(x, y) = 4x + 6y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities.\n\nFrom constraint (1), we get y ≤ -2x + 600.\nFrom constraint (2), we get y ≤ -0.5x + 500.\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. These vertices are the points where the constraint lines intersect. We have three lines: y = -2x + 600, y = -0.5x + 500, and y = 0 (x-axis).\n\nIntersection of y = -2x + 600 and y = -0.5x + 500:\n-2x + 600 = -0.5x + 500\n-1.5x = -100\nx = 200/3 ≈ 66.67\ny = -2(200/3) + 600 = 400/3 ≈ 133.33\n\nIntersection of y = -2x + 600 and y = 0:\n0 = -2x + 600\nx = 300\n\nIntersection of y = -0.5x + 500 and y = 0:\n0 = -0.5x + 500\nx = 1000\n\nNow, we have three vertices: (66.67, 133.33), (300, 0), and (1000, 0). However, the point (1000, 0) is not in the feasible region because it doesn't satisfy the land constraint. So, we have two vertices to consider: (66.67, 133.33) and (300, 0).\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at these vertices:\n\nP(66.67, 133.33) = 4(66.67) + 6(133.33) ≈ 1066.67\nP(300, 0) = 4(300) + 6(0) = 1200\n\nThe maximum profit is $1,200, which occurs when the farm produces 300 bushels of corn and 0 bushels of wheat."
