    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(2,4)$, we first need to find the derivative of the given function with respect to $x$. \n\nGiven function: $y = \\frac{x^2}{x-1}$\n\nWe can use the quotient rule to find the derivative:\n\n$(y)' = \\frac{(x^2)'(x-1) - (x^2)((x-1)')}{(x-1)^2}$\n\n$(y)' = \\frac{(2x)(x-1) - (x^2)(1)}{(x-1)^2}$\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point $(2,4)$. We do this by plugging in $x=2$ into the derivative:\n\n$(y)'|_{x=2} = \\frac{(2(2))(2-1) - (2^2)(1)}{(2-1)^2}$\n\n$(y)'|_{x=2} = \\frac{4 - 4}{1} = 0$\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at the point $(2,4)$ is $0$.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\nPlugging in the point $(2,4)$ and the slope $m=0$, we get:\n\n$y - 4 = 0(x - 2)$\n\nSince the slope is $0$, the tangent line is a horizontal line, and the equation simplifies to:\n\n$y = 4$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=\\frac{x^2}{x-1}$ at the point $(2,4)$ is $y=4$."
