    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in this network, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found. An augmenting path is a path from the source to the sink in the residual graph, which is a graph where each edge has a capacity equal to the remaining capacity of the corresponding edge in the original graph.\n\n1. Initialize flow in all pipes to 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph. One possible path is A -> C -> E -> G. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 (pipe CE). Update the flow in the original graph: AC = 2, CE = 2, EG = 2.\n\n3. Find another augmenting path. One possible path is A -> B -> D -> C -> E -> F -> G. The minimum capacity along this path is 3 (pipe CD). Update the flow in the original graph: AB = 3, BD = 3, CD = 3, CE = 4, EF = 3, FG = 3.\n\n4. Find another augmenting path. One possible path is A -> B -> D -> C -> E -> G. The minimum capacity along this path is 1 (pipe CE). Update the flow in the original graph: AB = 4, BD = 4, CD = 4, CE = 5, EG = 3.\n\n5. Find another augmenting path. One possible path is A -> C -> E -> F -> G. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 (pipe AC). Update the flow in the original graph: AC = 4, CE = 7, EF = 5, FG = 5.\n\n6. No more augmenting paths can be found in the residual graph.\n\nThe maximum flow from source node A to sink node G is the sum of the flows in the pipes entering G: EG = 3 and FG = 5. Therefore, the maximum flow is 3 + 5 = 8."
