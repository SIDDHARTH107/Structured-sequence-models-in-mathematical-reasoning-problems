    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x² + 2x + 3 from x = 0 to x = 5, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe function is: y = x² + 2x + 3\n\nFirst, let's find the integral of the function:\n\n∫(x² + 2x + 3) dx = (1/3)x³ + x² + 3x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the given limits, x = 0 and x = 5:\n\n[(1/3)(5)³ + (5)² + 3(5)] - [(1/3)(0)³ + (0)² + 3(0)]\n\n= [(1/3)(125) + 25 + 15] - [0]\n= [41.67 + 25 + 15]\n= 81.67\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x² + 2x + 3 from x = 0 to x = 5 is approximately 81.67 square units."
