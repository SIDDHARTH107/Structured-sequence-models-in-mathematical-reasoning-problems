    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal structure formed by recursively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra and removing the central one. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller tetrahedra.\n\nTo find the total number of small tetrahedrons required to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron of order 5, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of small tetrahedrons = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the order of the Sierpinski tetrahedron.\n\nFor order 5:\n\nTotal number of small tetrahedrons = (4^5 - 1) / 3\nTotal number of small tetrahedrons = (1024 - 1) / 3\nTotal number of small tetrahedrons = 1023 / 3\nTotal number of small tetrahedrons = 341\n\nSo, 341 small tetrahedrons are required to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron of order 5."
