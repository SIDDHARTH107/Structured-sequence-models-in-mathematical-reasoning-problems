    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem on optimal portfolio selection: \n\nSuppose you have $100,000 to invest in two stocks: stock A and stock B. The expected annual return on stock A is 15%, while the expected annual return on stock B is 10%. However, stock A is riskier than stock B, with a standard deviation of returns of 20% compared to 15% for stock B. You decide to allocate x% of your investment to stock A and (100-x)% of your investment to stock B. \n\nWhat is the optimal allocation x that maximizes the expected rate of return on your portfolio while keeping risk (measured by the portfolio's standard deviation) below 17%?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation x, we need to maximize the expected return while keeping the portfolio's standard deviation below 17%. Let's first find the expected return and standard deviation of the portfolio.\n\nExpected return of the portfolio (Rp) = x * Expected return of stock A + (1 - x) * Expected return of stock B\nRp = 0.15x + 0.10(1 - x)\n\nStandard deviation of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated using the formula:\nσp = √(x^2 * σa^2 + (1 - x)^2 * σb^2 + 2 * x * (1 - x) * Covariance(a, b))\n\nSince we don't have information about the covariance between stock A and stock B, we'll assume that they are uncorrelated, which means the covariance is 0.\n\nσp = √(x^2 * σa^2 + (1 - x)^2 * σb^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that maximizes Rp while keeping σp below 17% (0.17).\n\n0.17^2 ≥ x^2 * 0.20^2 + (1 - x)^2 * 0.15^2\n\n0.0289 ≥ 0.04x^2 + 0.0225 - 0.045x + 0.0225x^2\n\n0.0289 ≥ 0.0625x^2 - 0.045x + 0.0225\n\nNow, we need to solve this inequality for x. Since it's a quadratic inequality, we can find the critical points by setting the equation to 0 and solving for x:\n\n0.0625x^2 - 0.045x + 0.0225 - 0.0289 = 0\n\n0.0625x^2 - 0.045x - 0.0064 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (0.045 ± √(0.045^2 - 4 * 0.0625 * -0.0064)) / (2 * 0.0625)\n\nx ≈ 0.72 or x ≈ -0.14\n\nSince x represents a percentage allocation, the negative value doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the optimal allocation x is approximately 0.72 or 72%.\n\nSo, you should allocate 72% of your investment to stock A and the remaining 28% to stock B to maximize the expected rate of return while keeping the risk below 17%."
