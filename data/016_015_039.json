The total distance traveled by the curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal distance = (number of line segments) × (length of each line segment)\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order n, the number of line segments is given by:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4^n\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 5, the number of line segments is:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4^5 = 1024\n\nGiven that the length of each line segment is 1 unit, the total distance traveled by the Hilbert curve of order 5 is:\n\nTotal distance = 1024 × 1 = 1024 units"
