The monthly demand for the drug is given by the function D(x)=2,500-5x, where x is the number of units produced. What is the maximum profit the company can make in a month and how many units should they produce to achieve this profit? \n\n(Note: The profit function is P(x) = (800-500)x = 300x.)",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we need to find the number of units (x) that maximizes the profit function P(x) = 300x, subject to the demand function D(x) = 2,500 - 5x.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between the demand and the number of units produced. Since the company can only sell as many units as there is demand, we can set the demand equal to the number of units produced:\n\nD(x) = x\n2,500 - 5x = x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n6x = 2,500\nx = 2,500 / 6\nx â‰ˆ 416.67\n\nSince the company can only produce whole units, they should produce either 416 or 417 units. To determine which of these values maximizes the profit, we can plug them into the profit function P(x) = 300x:\n\nP(416) = 300 * 416 = $124,800\nP(417) = 300 * 417 = $125,100\n\nThe maximum profit the company can make in a month is $125,100, and they should produce 417 units to achieve this profit."
