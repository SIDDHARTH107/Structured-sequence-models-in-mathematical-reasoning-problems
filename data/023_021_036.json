    "message_2": "To determine the frequency spectrum of the rectangular pulse signal using Fourier transform, we first need to define the time-domain function of the signal. Since the pulse has a length of 5 ms (T = 0.005 s) and is centered at t = 0, the pulse can be defined as:\n\nx(t) = { 2 V, for -T/2 <= t <= T/2\n       { 0 V, otherwise\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of x(t) to obtain the frequency spectrum. The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt, from -∞ to ∞\n\nFor our rectangular pulse, the integral becomes:\n\nX(f) = ∫[2 * e^(-j2πft)] dt, from -T/2 to T/2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 2, dv = e^(-j2πft) dt\nThen, du = 0, v = (-1/j2πf) * e^(-j2πft)\n\nNow, apply integration by parts formula:\n\nX(f) = uv | from -T/2 to T/2 - ∫v du\nX(f) = [(-2/j2πf) * e^(-j2πft)] | from -T/2 to T/2 - 0\nX(f) = (-2/j2πf) * [e^(-j2πf(T/2)) - e^(j2πf(T/2))]\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression using Euler's formula:\n\nX(f) = (-2/j2πf) * [cos(2πf(T/2)) - j*sin(2πf(T/2)) - cos(2πf(T/2)) - j*sin(2πf(T/2))]\nX(f) = (-2/j2πf) * [-2j*sin(2πf(T/2))]\n\nThe j terms cancel out:\n\nX(f) = (4/2πf) * sin(2πf(T/2))\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of T:\n\nX(f) = (4/2πf) * sin(2πf(0.005/2))\nX(f) = (4/2πf) * sin(πf(0.005))\n\nThis is the frequency spectrum of the rectangular pulse signal. The function X(f) represents the amplitude of the signal at each frequency f."
