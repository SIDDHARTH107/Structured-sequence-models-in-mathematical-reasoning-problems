    "message_2": "Given the functions f(x) = x^2 and g(x) = 3x, we want to evaluate (f + g)(4).\n\nFirst, we need to find the outputs of f(4) and g(4):\n\nf(4) = 4^2 = 16\ng(4) = 3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, we can use the \"addition +\" higher-order function to add together the outputs of f(4) and g(4):\n\n(f + g)(4) = f(4) + g(4) = 16 + 12 = 28\n\nSo, (f + g)(4) = 28."
