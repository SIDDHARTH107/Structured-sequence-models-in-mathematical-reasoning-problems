    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + u * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = u * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = 0.4 - 6 / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2).\n\nA fixed point (x*, y*) is a point that remains unchanged under the map, i.e., x* = x_{n+1} and y* = y_{n+1} when x_n = x* and y_n = y*.\n\nGiven the parameter values a = 0.9 and u = 0.4, we can find the fixed point by solving the following system of equations:\n\nx* = 1 + 0.4 * (x* * cos(t*) - y* * sin(t*))\ny* = 0.4 * (x* * sin(t*) + y* * cos(t*))\n\nwhere t* = 0.4 - 6 / (1 + x*^2 + y*^2).\n\nTo find the fixed point numerically, we can use an iterative method such as the fixed-point iteration method. Starting with an initial guess (x0, y0), we can update the values of x and y using the Ikeda map equations until the values converge to a fixed point. However, since the Ikeda map is chaotic, the fixed point may be difficult to find, and the convergence may be slow or not guaranteed.\n\nIn this case, it is recommended to use a numerical solver or software package to find the fixed point for the given parameter values."
