    "message_1": "Suppose a salesman makes on average 3 sales per day. The probability of making a sale on any given day is 0.6. We can model the number of sales he makes as a Markov Chain. What is the probability that he makes exactly two sales tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the salesman makes exactly two sales tomorrow, we can use the binomial probability formula, since the number of sales follows a binomial distribution. The formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of making exactly k sales\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the average number of sales per day, which is 3)\n- k is the number of successful trials (in this case, 2 sales)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.4)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(3, 2) * 0.6^2 * 0.4^(3-2)\n\nC(3, 2) can be calculated as (3!)/(2!(3-2)!) = (3*2*1)/((2*1)*(1)) = 3\n\nSo, P(X = 2) = 3 * 0.6^2 * 0.4^1 = 3 * 0.36 * 0.4 = 1.08 * 0.4 = 0.432\n\nTherefore, the probability that the salesman makes exactly two sales tomorrow is 0.432 or 43.2%."
