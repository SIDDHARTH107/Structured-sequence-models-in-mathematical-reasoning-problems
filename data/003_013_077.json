What is the minimum length of the ladder in feet required to reach the top of the wall? (Round your answer to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function sine. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder in this case).\n\nsin(60째) = opposite side (height of the wall) / hypotenuse (length of the ladder)\n\nWe are given that the foot of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall, which is the adjacent side in the right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the wall.\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\nwhere a is the adjacent side (6 feet), b is the opposite side (height of the wall), and c is the hypotenuse (length of the ladder).\n\nWe can also use the trigonometric function cosine to find the height of the wall. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\ncos(60째) = adjacent side (6 feet) / hypotenuse (length of the ladder)\n\ncos(60째) = 0.5 (since cos(60째) = 1/2)\n\n0.5 = 6 / length of the ladder\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of the ladder:\n\nlength of the ladder = 6 / 0.5\nlength of the ladder = 12 feet\n\nSo, the minimum length of the ladder required to reach the top of the wall is 12 feet."
