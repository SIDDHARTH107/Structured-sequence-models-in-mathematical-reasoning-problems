Suppose $m,n$ are two integers such that $\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)=\\operatorname{lcm}(m+n,\\operatorname{char}(k))$. Show that $$[m]P + [n]Q = [m+n] \\left(\\frac{m}{m+n}P + \\frac{n}{m+n}Q\\right).$$",
    "message_2": "Since $A$ is an abelian variety, it has a group structure. Let's denote the group operation by $+$ and the identity element by $O$. We want to show that\n$$[m]P + [n]Q = [m+n] \\left(\\frac{m}{m+n}P + \\frac{n}{m+n}Q\\right).$$\n\nFirst, we observe that $\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)=\\operatorname{lcm}(m+n,\\operatorname{char}(k))$ implies that $m+n$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{char}(k)$. Since the characteristic of $k$ is $0$, this means that $m+n=0$. Therefore, $n=-m$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation we want to prove as\n$$[m]P + [-m]Q = [0] \\left(\\frac{m}{0}P + \\frac{-m}{0}Q\\right).$$\n\nSince $[0]R=O$ for any point $R \\in A(k)$, the right-hand side of the equation is just the identity element $O$. So, we need to show that\n$$[m]P + [-m]Q = O.$$\n\nRecall that $[-m]Q$ is the inverse of $[m]Q$ in the group structure of $A$. Therefore, we have\n$$[m]P + [-m]Q = [m]P + ([m]Q)^{-1}.$$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $A$ is an abelian variety, which means that its group operation is commutative. So, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as\n$$[m]P + ([m]Q)^{-1} = ([m]P + [m]Q) + (-[m]Q) = [m](P+Q) + (-[m]Q).$$\n\nSince $m+n=0$, we have $[m](P+Q) = [m]P + [m]Q$. Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation becomes\n$$[m](P+Q) + (-[m]Q) = [m]P + [m]Q + (-[m]Q) = [m]P.$$\n\nSo, we need to show that $[m]P = O$. Since $A$ is an abelian variety, it is also a divisible group. This means that for any point $R \\in A(k)$ and any integer $d$, there exists a point $S \\in A(k)$ such that $[d]S = R$. In particular, for $R = [m]P$, there exists a point $S \\in A(k)$ such that $[m]S = [m]P$. But then, we have\n$$O = [m](-S) = [m]((-1)S) = [m](S + (-S)) = [m]P + [m](-S) = [m]P + (-[m]S) = [m]P + (-[m]P) = [m]P.$$\n\nThus, we have shown that $[m]P + [n]Q = [m+n] \\left(\\frac{m}{m+n}P + \\frac{n}{m+n}Q\\right)$, as desired."
