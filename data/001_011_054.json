    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first eliminate the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD), which is x(x-3).\n\nx(x-3)[(2/x) + (1/(x-3))] = x(x-3)[(5/(x^2-3x))]\n\nNow, distribute the LCD to each term:\n\n(2x(x-3)) + (x(x-3)(1/(x-3))) = 5\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(2x^2 - 6x) + x^2 - 3x^2 = 5\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-2x^2 + 6x = 5\n\nMove all terms to one side of the equation:\n\n2x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can solve for x by factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square. In this case, factoring is the easiest method:\n\n(2x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - 5 = 0\n2x = 5\nx = 5/2\n\nx - 1 = 0\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 5/2 and 1."
