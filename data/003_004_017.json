    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2 sin^2 x - 3 sin x - 2 = 0, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in terms of sin x. Let y = sin x, then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 - 3y - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(2y + 1)(y - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for y:\n\n1) 2y + 1 = 0\n2y = -1\ny = -1/2\n\n2) y - 2 = 0\ny = 2\n\nHowever, since y = sin x, and the sine function has a range of -1 to 1, the second solution (y = 2) is not valid. So, we only need to consider the first solution:\n\nsin x = -1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the range of 0 to 2π that satisfy this equation. The arcsin function gives us the principal value:\n\nx = arcsin(-1/2)\n\nx = -π/6\n\nHowever, since x must be in the range of 0 to 2π, we can add 2π to this value:\n\nx = -π/6 + 2π\nx = 11π/6\n\nThere is another solution in the range of 0 to 2π, which is the reflection of the first solution across the y-axis:\n\nx = π - (-π/6)\nx = π + π/6\nx = 7π/6\n\nSo, the two solutions for x in the range of 0 to 2π are:\n\nx = 11π/6 and x = 7π/6"
