    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 7 cm. Find its area.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 10 cm and the height is 7 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (10 * 7) / 2\nArea = 70 / 2\nArea = 35 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 35 square centimeters."
