    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first write the given system in the form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  6 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 8  |\n    | 16 |\n\nNow, we can find the determinant of matrix A (denoted as |A|):\n\n|A| = (2 * 6) - (3 * 4) = 12 - 12 = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the given system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. In this case, the system is either inconsistent (no solution) or dependent (infinitely many solutions).\n\nTo determine which case it is, we can row reduce the augmented matrix [A|B] to its row-echelon form:\n\n[A|B] = | 2  3 | 8  |\n        | 4  6 | 16 |\n\nRow reduce:\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1:\n\n| 2  3 | 8  |\n| 0  0 | 0  |\n\nThe row-echelon form of the augmented matrix indicates that the system is dependent, as there is no row with a leading 1 in the last column (which would indicate inconsistency). In this case, the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo express the solution set, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. From the first row, we have:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\nWe can solve for x:\n\nx = (8 - 3y) / 2\n\nThe solution set is:\n\nx = (8 - 3y) / 2, y ∈ ℝ"
