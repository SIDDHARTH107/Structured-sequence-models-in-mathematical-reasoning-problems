    "message_2": "To maximize the area that can be cut out of the plate while still being able to bend it into an open rectangular box, we need to consider the dimensions of the box that will be formed.\n\nLet x and y be the dimensions of the base of the box, and h be the height. The perimeter of the base is 2x + 2y, and since the metal plate has a perimeter of 2(10) + 2(15) = 50 cm, we have:\n\n2x + 2y = 50 - 4h\n\nx + y = 25 - 2h\n\nNow, the area of the base of the box is A = xy. We want to maximize this area. To do this, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In this case, we have:\n\n(x + y) / 2 ≥ √(xy)\n\n(25 - 2h) / 2 ≥ √A\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n(25 - 2h)^2 / 4 ≥ A\n\nTo maximize A, we need to minimize the left-hand side of the inequality. The minimum value of (25 - 2h)^2 occurs when h = 0 (since the square of a number is always non-negative). In this case, we have:\n\n(25 - 2(0))^2 / 4 = 625 / 4 = 156.25\n\nHowever, h = 0 means that the metal plate is not bent at all, which is not a valid solution. To find the maximum area that can be cut out while still being able to bend the plate, we need to consider the dimensions of the circular hole.\n\nThe area of the circular hole is π(2)^2 = 4π cm^2. To ensure that the remaining metal can still be bent into an open rectangular box, we need to have:\n\nA + 4π ≤ 156.25\n\nA ≤ 156.25 - 4π\n\nSince π ≈ 3.14, we have:\n\nA ≤ 156.25 - 4(3.14) ≈ 144.69 cm^2\n\nThus, the maximum area that can be cut out of the plate so that the remaining metal can still be bent into an open rectangular box without a lid is approximately 144.69 cm^2."
