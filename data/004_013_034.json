    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval [0, 5], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 - 15x + 30)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x - 15\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting f'(x) = 0:\n\n3x^2 - 12x - 15 = 0\n\nWe can factor this equation:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x - 5) = 0\n3(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0\n\nThe critical points are x = 5 and x = -1. However, since x = -1 is not in the interval [0, 5], we only need to consider x = 5.\n\nNow, let's evaluate f(x) at the endpoints of the interval and the critical point:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 - 15(0) + 30 = 30\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 6(5)^2 - 15(5) + 30 = 125 - 150 - 75 + 30 = -70\n\nSince f(5) = -70 is the minimum value in the interval [0, 5], and f(0) = 30 is the maximum value in the interval [0, 5], we have:\n\nMaximum value: f(x) = 30 at x = 0\nMinimum value: f(x) = -70 at x = 5"
