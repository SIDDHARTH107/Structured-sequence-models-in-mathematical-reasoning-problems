    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference, denoted as (A △ B)'. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the given set. Assuming the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nSo, (A △ B)' = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B:\n\nA' = {4}\nB' = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B':\n\nA' △ B' = {1, 4}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B)' = {2, 3} and (A' △ B') = {1, 4}. These two sets are not equal, so we have shown that (A △ B)' is not equal to (A' △ B')."
