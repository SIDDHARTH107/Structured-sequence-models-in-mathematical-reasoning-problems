    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n```\n2x + 3y - 4z = 6\n5x - 2y + 3z = 10\nx + 4y - z = -2\n```\n\nWe can represent this system in the matrix form Ax = b, where\n\nA = | 2  3 -4 |\n    | 5 -2  3 |\n    | 1  4 -1 |\n\nb = |  6  |\n    | 10  |\n    | -2  |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\n\nWe will use the Doolittle method for LU decomposition. In this method, we assume that the diagonal elements of the lower triangular matrix L are 1.\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | l21  1  0 |\n    | l31 l32  1 |\n\nU = | u11 u12 u13 |\n    |  0  u22 u23 |\n    |  0   0  u33 |\n\nNow, we will find the elements of L and U using the following relations:\n\n1. u11 = a11 = 2\n2. u12 = a12 = 3\n3. u13 = a13 = -4\n4. l21 = a21 / u11 = 5 / 2\n5. l31 = a31 / u11 = 1 / 2\n6. u22 = a22 - l21 * u12 = -2 - (5/2) * 3 = -11/2\n7. u23 = a23 - l21 * u13 = 3 - (5/2) * (-4) = 17/2\n8. l32 = (a32 - l31 * u12) / u22 = (4 - (1/2) * 3) / (-11/2) = -1/2\n9. u33 = a33 - l31 * u13 - l32 * u23 = -1 - (1/2) * (-4) - (-1/2) * (17/2) = -3\n\nSo, the L and U matrices are:\n\nL = |  1   0   0  |\n    | 5/2  1   0  |\n    | 1/2 -1/2  1  |\n\nU = |  2   3  -4  |\n    |  0 -11/2 17/2|\n    |  0   0  -3  |\n\nStep 2: Solve Ly = b\n\nWe will now solve the equation Ly = b for y:\n\n|  1   0   0  | | y1 |   |  6  |\n| 5/2  1   0  | | y2 | = | 10  |\n| 1/2 -1/2  1  | | y3 |   | -2  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\n1. y1 = 6\n2. y2 = 10 - 5/2 * y1 = -5\n3. y3 = -2 - 1/2 * y1 + 1/2 * y2 = 3\n\nSo, y = |  6  |\n        | -5  |\n        |  3  |\n\nStep 3: Solve Ux = y\n\nFinally, we will solve the equation Ux = y for x:\n\n|  2   3  -4  | | x1 |   |  6  |\n|  0 -11/2 17/2| | x2 | = | -5  |\n|  0   0  -3  | | x3 |   |  3  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\n1. x3 = -1\n2. x2 = (-5 - 17/2 * x3) / (-11/2) = 2\n3. x1 = (6 - 3 * x2 + 4 * x3) / 2 = 1\n\nSo, the final solution is:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = -1"
