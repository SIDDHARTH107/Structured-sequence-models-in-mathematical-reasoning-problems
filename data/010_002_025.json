Define a sequence (x_n) in X by x_n = 2 for all n. Show that (x_n) converges in X, and find its limit.",
    "message_2": "To show that the sequence (x_n) converges in the topological space X, we need to find a limit point x such that for any open set U containing x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N, x_n ∈ U.\n\nSince the sequence (x_n) is defined by x_n = 2 for all n, the sequence is constant. Therefore, the limit of the sequence should also be 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the open sets containing 2 in the topology of X:\n\n1. {1, 2}\n2. {1, 2, 3}\n\nFor the open set {1, 2}, since x_n = 2 for all n, it is clear that for any natural number N, x_n ∈ {1, 2} for all n ≥ N.\n\nSimilarly, for the open set {1, 2, 3}, since x_n = 2 for all n, it is clear that for any natural number N, x_n ∈ {1, 2, 3} for all n ≥ N.\n\nThus, for any open set U containing 2, there exists a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N, x_n ∈ U. Therefore, the sequence (x_n) converges in the topological space X, and its limit is 2."
