    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation $\\sqrt{5x+9} = 2x + 1$, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n$(\\sqrt{5x+9})^2 = (2x + 1)^2$\n\nStep 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.\n$5x + 9 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1$\n\nStep 3: Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation.\n$4x^2 - x - 8 = 0$\n\nStep 4: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. In this case, we can factor the equation.\n$(4x + 3)(x - 2) = 0$\n\nStep 5: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.\n$4x + 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -\\frac{3}{4}$\n\n$x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2$\n\nStep 6: Check the solutions in the original equation to make sure they are valid.\nFor $x = -\\frac{3}{4}$:\n$\\sqrt{5(-\\frac{3}{4})+9} = 2(-\\frac{3}{4}) + 1$\n$\\sqrt{-\\frac{15}{4}+9} = -\\frac{3}{2} + 1$\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{21}{4}} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThis solution is not valid because the square root of a positive number cannot equal a negative number.\n\nFor $x = 2$:\n$\\sqrt{5(2)+9} = 2(2) + 1$\n$\\sqrt{19} = 5$\n\nThis solution is valid.\n\nSo, the solution to the radical equation $\\sqrt{5x+9} = 2x + 1$ is $x = 2$."
