The data was collected and stored in a dataset. The company wants to analyze the dataset to get insights about the relationship between age and income. The average age of the participants was 35 years and the average income was $50,000. The standard deviation of age and income were 10 years and $15,000, respectively. Assuming the age and income are normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected participant from the dataset will be older than 40 years and have an income between $40,000 and $60,000 (inclusive)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the probabilities of each condition separately and then multiply them together, assuming that age and income are independent variables.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of a participant being older than 40 years. We will use the Z-score formula to standardize the age:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the age, μ is the average age (35 years), and σ is the standard deviation of age (10 years).\n\nFor a participant with an age of 40 years:\n\nZ = (40 - 35) / 10 = 0.5\n\nNow, we will use the Z-table or a calculator to find the probability of a participant having a Z-score greater than 0.5. The probability of a Z-score less than 0.5 is 0.6915, so the probability of a Z-score greater than 0.5 is:\n\nP(Z > 0.5) = 1 - P(Z < 0.5) = 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085\n\nNext, let's find the probability of a participant having an income between $40,000 and $60,000. We will standardize the income using the Z-score formula:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the income, μ is the average income ($50,000), and σ is the standard deviation of income ($15,000).\n\nFor a participant with an income of $40,000:\n\nZ1 = ($40,000 - $50,000) / $15,000 = -0.6667\n\nFor a participant with an income of $60,000:\n\nZ2 = ($60,000 - $50,000) / $15,000 = 0.6667\n\nNow, we will use the Z-table or a calculator to find the probability of a participant having a Z-score between -0.6667 and 0.6667:\n\nP(-0.6667 < Z < 0.6667) = P(Z < 0.6667) - P(Z < -0.6667) = 0.7475 - 0.2525 = 0.4950\n\nFinally, assuming that age and income are independent variables, we can multiply the probabilities together to find the probability of a participant meeting both conditions:\n\nP(older than 40 years and income between $40,000 and $60,000) = P(older than 40 years) * P(income between $40,000 and $60,000) = 0.3085 * 0.4950 ≈ 0.1527\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected participant from the dataset will be older than 40 years and have an income between $40,000 and $60,000 (inclusive) is approximately 15.27%."
