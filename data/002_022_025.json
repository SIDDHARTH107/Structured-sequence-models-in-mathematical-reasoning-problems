    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 10 inches and a minor radius of 4 inches. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "The volume of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nIn this case, the major radius (R) is 10 inches and the minor radius (r) is 4 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 4^2) * (2 * π * 10)\nVolume = (π * 16) * (20 * π)\nVolume = 320 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 1005.31 cubic inches."
