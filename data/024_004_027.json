    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\n1. First fundamental form:\nGiven the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we can write it as a parametric form:\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives with respect to u and v:\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nI = [E, F; F, G]\nwhere E = r_u • r_u, F = r_u • r_v, and G = r_v • r_v.\n\nE = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), u = 1 and v = 1, so:\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nSo, the first fundamental form is:\nI = [5, 4; 4, 5]\n\n2. Second fundamental form:\nWe need to find the normal vector to the surface. The normal vector is given by the cross product of r_u and r_v:\nN = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, 2v) = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives of r:\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nII = [L, M; M, N]\nwhere L = r_uu • N, M = r_uv • N, and N = r_vv • N.\n\nL = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\nM = (0, 0, 0) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 0\nN = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), u = 1 and v = 1, so the second fundamental form is:\nII = [2, 0; 0, 2]\n\n3. Mean curvature:\nThe mean curvature H is given by the formula:\nH = (EG - F^2)(LN - M^2) - (FL - EM)^2 / 2(EG - F^2)^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have E = 5, F = 4, G = 5, L = 2, M = 0, and N = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nH = (5*5 - 4^2)(2*2 - 0^2) - (5*0 - 4*2)^2 / 2(5*5 - 4^2)^2\nH = (25 - 16)(4) - (-8)^2 / 2(9)^2\nH = (9)(4) - 64 / 2(81)\nH = 36 - 64 / 162\nH = -28 / 162\nH = -14 / 81\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) is H = -14/81."
