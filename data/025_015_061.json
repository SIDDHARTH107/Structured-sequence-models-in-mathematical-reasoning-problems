    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane passing through the points (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9), we first need to find two vectors that lie on the plane and then find their cross product to get the normal vector of the plane.\n\nLet A = (1,2,3), B = (4,5,6), and C = (7,8,9).\n\nVector AB = B - A = (4-1, 5-2, 6-3) = (3,3,3)\nVector AC = C - A = (7-1, 8-2, 9-3) = (6,6,6)\n\nNotice that vectors AB and AC are parallel (they are scalar multiples of each other), which means that points A, B, and C are collinear (lie on a straight line). In this case, there is no unique plane that passes through these three points, as any plane containing the line formed by these points will pass through all three points."
