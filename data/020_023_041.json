    "message_1": "Suppose there is an investor who wants to allocate their $100,000 investment between two stocks: Stock A and Stock B. In the past year, Stock A has returned 8%, while Stock B has returned 12%. However, the investor expects the return on Stock A to be normally distributed with a mean of 7% and a standard deviation of 5%, while the return on Stock B is expected to be normally distributed with a mean of 10% and a standard deviation of 8%.\n\nWhat is the optimal allocation of the investor's investment between the two stocks such that the expected return is maximized while keeping the risk, measured by the standard deviation of the portfolio, at a desirable level? Assume that the correlation between the two stocks is 0.6.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation between the two stocks, we can use the concept of the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier is a set of portfolios that provide the highest expected return for a given level of risk (standard deviation). In this case, we have two stocks with their respective expected returns, standard deviations, and correlation.\n\nLet x be the proportion of the investment in Stock A and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in Stock B.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (E[Rp]) can be calculated as:\nE[Rp] = x * E[RA] + (1-x) * E[RB]\nwhere E[RA] = 7% and E[RB] = 10%.\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated as:\nσp = sqrt(x^2 * σA^2 + (1-x)^2 * σB^2 + 2 * x * (1-x) * ρAB * σA * σB)\nwhere σA = 5%, σB = 8%, and ρAB = 0.6.\n\nTo find the optimal allocation, we need to maximize the expected return while keeping the risk at a desirable level. This can be done by finding the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, which is the ratio of the excess return of the portfolio to its standard deviation:\n\nSharpe ratio = (E[Rp] - Rf) / σp\nwhere Rf is the risk-free rate. For simplicity, we can assume Rf = 0.\n\nWe can use numerical optimization techniques to find the value of x that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. Using a solver or optimization tool, we find that the optimal allocation is approximately x = 0.416 for Stock A and (1-x) = 0.584 for Stock B.\n\nThus, the investor should allocate approximately 41.6% of their investment ($41,600) in Stock A and 58.4% ($58,400) in Stock B to maximize the expected return while keeping the risk at a desirable level."
