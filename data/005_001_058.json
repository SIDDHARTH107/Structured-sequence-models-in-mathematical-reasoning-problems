    "message_1": "A medical researcher is testing a new drug intended to lower blood pressure. The average systolic blood pressure for a population of patients with high blood pressure is known to be 148 mmHg. The researcher selects a sample of 30 patients and administers the new drug to them. After a month of treatment, the researcher measures the systolic blood pressure of each patient in the sample and finds that the average is 142 mmHg with a standard deviation of 6 mmHg. Can the researcher conclude at 5% level of significance that the new drug is effective in lowering blood pressure? Use hypothesis testing to answer the question.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the new drug is effective in lowering blood pressure, we will perform a hypothesis test using the following steps:\n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1)\nH0: The new drug has no effect on blood pressure (µ = 148 mmHg)\nH1: The new drug lowers blood pressure (µ < 148 mmHg)\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance (α)\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic\nWe will use the t-test statistic since the sample size is small (n = 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. The formula for the t-test statistic is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √n)\n\nt = (142 - 148) / (6 / √30)\nt = -6 / (6 / √30)\nt = -6 / (6 / 5.48)\nt = -6 / 1.095\nt ≈ -5.48\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value\nSince this is a one-tailed test (we are only interested in whether the new drug lowers blood pressure), we will look up the critical value for a t-distribution with 29 degrees of freedom (n - 1) and α = 0.05.\n\nUsing a t-table or calculator, the critical value is approximately -1.699.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value\nOur test statistic, t ≈ -5.48, is more extreme (further to the left) than the critical value, -1.699.\n\nStep 6: Make a decision\nSince the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1). We can conclude at a 5% level of significance that the new drug is effective in lowering blood pressure."
