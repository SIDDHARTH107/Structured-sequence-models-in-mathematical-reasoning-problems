    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 5x + 3 and find the vertex, axis of symmetry, and y-intercept, we'll first need to find the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nVertex: (h, k) = (-b / 2a, f(-b / 2a))\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nh = -5 / (2 * 2) = -5 / 4\nk = f(-5 / 4) = 2(-5 / 4)^2 + 5(-5 / 4) + 3\n\nCalculating k:\nk = 2(25 / 16) - (25 / 2) + 3\nk = 50 / 16 - 25 / 2 + 3\nk = 50 / 16 - 200 / 16 + 48 / 16\nk = (-102) / 16\n\nSo the vertex is (-5/4, -102/16).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, and its equation is given by:\n\nx = h\n\nIn this case, h = -5/4, so the axis of symmetry is x = -5/4.\n\nThe y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis, which occurs when x = 0. Plugging x = 0 into the equation, we get:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 + 5(0) + 3\ny = 3\n\nSo the y-intercept is (0, 3).\n\nIn summary:\n- Vertex: (-5/4, -102/16)\n- Axis of symmetry: x = -5/4\n- Y-intercept: (0, 3)\n\nTo graph the equation, plot the vertex, y-intercept, and a few additional points by plugging in x values and solving for y. Then, draw a parabola that passes through these points, making sure it is symmetric about the axis of symmetry."
