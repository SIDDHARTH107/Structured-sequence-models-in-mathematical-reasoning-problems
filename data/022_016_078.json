    "message_2": "To determine the image of $f(\\mathbb{D})$, we will use the Schwarz Lemma, which states that if $f$ is a holomorphic function on the open unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ with $f(0) = 0$ and $|f(z)| \\leq 1$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$, then $|f(z)| \\leq |z|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$, and if $|f(z_0)| = |z_0|$ for some $z_0 \\neq 0$, then $f(z) = e^{i\\theta}z$ for some real number $\\theta$.\n\nNow, let $g(z) = \\frac{f(z) - f(0)}{z - 0} = \\frac{f(z)}{z}$ for $z \\neq 0$. Then $g$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{D} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, and by the Riemann removable singularity theorem, we can extend $g$ to a holomorphic function on $\\mathbb{D}$ by setting $g(0) = f'(0) = 1$. \n\nConsider the function $h(z) = \\frac{1}{g(z)}$. Then $h$ is holomorphic on $\\mathbb{D}$, and $h(0) = \\frac{1}{g(0)} = 1$. Moreover, for $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$, we have $|h(z)| = \\frac{1}{|g(z)|} \\geq \\frac{1}{|z|}$, since $|g(z)| \\leq |z|$ by the Schwarz Lemma. Thus, applying the Schwarz Lemma to $h$, we get $|h(z)| \\leq |z|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$, and so $|g(z)| \\geq \\frac{1}{|z|}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we have $\\frac{1}{|z|} \\leq |g(z)| \\leq |z|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$. Therefore, $|f(z)| = |z||g(z)| \\geq |z|^2$ and $|f(z)| \\leq |z|^2$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$. In particular, for $r \\in (0, 1)$, we have $|f(r)| \\geq r^2$ and $|f(r)| \\leq r^2$. Thus, $|f(r)| = r^2$ for all $r \\in (0, 1)$.\n\nNow, let $w \\in \\mathbb{C}$ with $|w| < 1$. Then there exists $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$ such that $|z| = \\sqrt{|w|}$ and $f(z) = w$. Indeed, we can take $z = \\sqrt{|w|}e^{i\\arg(w)}$, where $\\arg(w)$ is the argument of $w$. Then $|f(z)| = |z|^2 = |w|$, and so $f(\\mathbb{D})$ contains all complex numbers with modulus less than 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the image of $f(\\mathbb{D})$ under the map $f$ is the open unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ itself."
