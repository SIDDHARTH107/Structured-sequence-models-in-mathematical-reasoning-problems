    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) between 216 and 594 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (594) by the smaller number (216) and find the remainder.\n   594 รท 216 = 2 with a remainder of 162\n\n2. Replace the larger number (594) with the smaller number (216), and the smaller number with the remainder (162).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD between 216 and 162.\n\n3. Repeat step 1 with the new numbers.\n   216 รท 162 = 1 with a remainder of 54\n\n4. Replace the larger number (216) with the smaller number (162), and the smaller number with the remainder (54).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD between 162 and 54.\n\n5. Repeat step 1 with the new numbers.\n   162 รท 54 = 3 with a remainder of 0\n\n6. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 54.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor between 216 and 594 is 54."
