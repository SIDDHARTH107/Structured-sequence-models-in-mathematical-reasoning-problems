    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the metric induced in S by the embedding into $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the Euclidean metric, we first need to parameterize the surface of the sphere S with radius 3. We can use the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) to do this, where r is the radial distance, θ is the polar angle, and φ is the azimuthal angle.\n\nSince we are considering the surface of the sphere, we have r = 3. The parameterization of the sphere in terms of θ and φ is given by:\n\nx(θ, φ) = 3 * sin(θ) * cos(φ)\ny(θ, φ) = 3 * sin(θ) * sin(φ)\nz(θ, φ) = 3 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we need to find the metric tensor g_ij induced on the surface S. To do this, we compute the partial derivatives of the parameterization with respect to θ and φ:\n\n∂x/∂θ = 3 * cos(θ) * cos(φ)\n∂x/∂φ = -3 * sin(θ) * sin(φ)\n∂y/∂θ = 3 * cos(θ) * sin(φ)\n∂y/∂φ = 3 * sin(θ) * cos(φ)\n∂z/∂θ = -3 * sin(θ)\n∂z/∂φ = 0\n\nNow, we can compute the metric tensor g_ij by taking the dot product of the partial derivatives:\n\ng_θθ = (∂x/∂θ)^2 + (∂y/∂θ)^2 + (∂z/∂θ)^2 = 9 * (cos(θ)^2 * cos(φ)^2 + cos(θ)^2 * sin(φ)^2 + sin(θ)^2) = 9\ng_θφ = (∂x/∂θ)(∂x/∂φ) + (∂y/∂θ)(∂y/∂φ) + (∂z/∂θ)(∂z/∂φ) = 0\ng_φφ = (∂x/∂φ)^2 + (∂y/∂φ)^2 + (∂z/∂φ)^2 = 9 * (sin(θ)^2 * sin(φ)^2 + sin(θ)^2 * cos(φ)^2) = 9 * sin(θ)^2\n\nThe metric tensor g_ij is then given by:\n\ng_ij = | 9          0        |\n          | 0    9 * sin(θ)^2 |\n\nNow, we can compute the determinant of the metric tensor:\n\ndet(g_ij) = 9 * 9 * sin(θ)^2 = 81 * sin(θ)^2\n\nFinally, the volume form of the metric induced in S is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor:\n\n√(det(g_ij)) = √(81 * sin(θ)^2) = 9 * sin(θ)\n\nSo, the volume form of the metric induced in S by the embedding into $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the Euclidean metric is 9 * sin(θ)."
