    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. We can identify them as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_36\nThis is the group of integers modulo 36 under addition. It is generated by a single element of order 36.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 × C_4\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has elements of the form (a, b), where a is an element of C_9 and b is an element of C_4.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_3 × C_12\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 12. It has elements of the form (a, b), where a is an element of C_3 and b is an element of C_12.\n\n4. Semi-direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 ⋊ C_4\nThis group is formed by taking the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It is a non-abelian group, meaning that the group operation is not commutative.\n\nThese are the four non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
