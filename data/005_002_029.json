    "message_1": "A smartphone manufacturer claims that their latest model has a battery life of around 30 hours in normal use. To test this claim, a sample of 50 users used the phone and recorded the battery life in hours. The average battery life of the sample was found to be 28.5 hours with a standard deviation of 4.7 hours. Find a 95% confidence interval for the true mean battery life of the phone.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the true mean battery life of the phone, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (28.5 hours)\nt = t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom (df = n - 1)\ns = sample standard deviation (4.7 hours)\nn = sample size (50 users)\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score. For a 95% confidence interval and 49 degrees of freedom, the t-score is approximately 2.0096 (you can find this value using a t-distribution table or an online calculator).\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 28.5 ± (2.0096 * (4.7 / √50))\n\nCI = 28.5 ± (2.0096 * (4.7 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 28.5 ± (2.0096 * 0.665)\n\nCI = 28.5 ± 1.3364\n\nSo the 95% confidence interval for the true mean battery life of the phone is approximately (27.1636, 29.8364) hours. This means that we are 95% confident that the true mean battery life of the phone is between 27.1636 hours and 29.8364 hours."
