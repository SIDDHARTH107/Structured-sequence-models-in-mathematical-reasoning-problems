    "message_2": "To find the probability of both a hurricane and a wildfire occurring in the same year, we can multiply the individual probabilities together, assuming they are independent events.\n\nProbability of both events occurring = (probability of a hurricane) × (probability of a wildfire)\n= 0.05 × 0.02\n= 0.001\n\nSo, the probability of both a hurricane and a wildfire occurring in the same year in this region is 0.001 or 0.1%."
