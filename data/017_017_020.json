    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the cyclic group C30. There is only one group of order 30 that is isomorphic to C30, and that is the group itself, C30. This is because cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic to each other.\n\nNow, let's consider the dihedral group D15. Recall that the dihedral group of order 2n, denoted Dn, is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon, including rotations and reflections. The order of Dn is 2n. In our case, n = 15, so the order of D15 is 2 * 15 = 30. There is only one dihedral group of order 30, which is D15 itself.\n\nNow, let's show that there exists at least one non-abelian group of order 30 and determine its isomorphism type. The prime factorization of 30 is 2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup, a Sylow 3-subgroup, and a Sylow 5-subgroup in any group of order 30.\n\nLet P2, P3, and P5 be Sylow 2, 3, and 5-subgroups, respectively. Since the orders of these subgroups are pairwise coprime, they are all cyclic. Let P2 = ⟨a⟩, P3 = ⟨b⟩, and P5 = ⟨c⟩, where a has order 2, b has order 3, and c has order 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups divides the order of the group and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. In our case, this means that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is either 1 or 10. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal in the group. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups is either 1 or 6. If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, then it is also normal in the group.\n\nIf both P3 and P5 are normal, then their product, P3P5, is a subgroup of order 15, and it is also normal. Since P2 has order 2, it is also normal. In this case, the group would be the direct product of P2, P3, and P5, which is isomorphic to C2 x C3 x C5, and this group is abelian.\n\nHowever, if there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups, then neither P3 nor P5 is normal. In this case, we can construct a non-abelian group of order 30 using the semidirect product. Let φ: P2 → Aut(P3 x P5) be a nontrivial homomorphism. Then, the semidirect product G = (P3 x P5) ⋊_φ P2 is a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nTo see that G is non-abelian, note that the action of P2 on P3 x P5 by conjugation is nontrivial, so there exist elements b and c in P3 x P5 such that a * (b * c) * a^(-1) ≠ b * c. Therefore, G is not abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, there is one group of order 30 isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, one group isomorphic to the dihedral group D15, and at least one non-abelian group of order 30, which can be constructed as a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups."
