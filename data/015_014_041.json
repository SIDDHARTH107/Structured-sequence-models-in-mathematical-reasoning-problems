The temperature deviates from the mean by an amount that is proportional to the square of the deviation from the mean. If the current temperature is 23°C, what is the probability that the temperature in the city will be between 18°C and 22°C tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability distribution of the temperature. Since the deviation from the mean is proportional to the square of the deviation, we can write the equation as:\n\ndT/dt = k(T - 20)^2\n\nwhere dT/dt is the rate of change of temperature, T is the temperature, and k is the proportionality constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of k. We know that the current temperature is 23°C, so:\n\ndT/dt = k(23 - 20)^2\ndT/dt = k(3)^2\ndT/dt = 9k\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the exact value of k. However, we can still analyze the problem qualitatively.\n\nWhen the temperature is above the mean (20°C), the rate of change is positive, meaning the temperature will increase. When the temperature is below the mean, the rate of change is negative, meaning the temperature will decrease. This suggests that the temperature will oscillate around the mean value of 20°C.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the temperature will be between 18°C and 22°C tomorrow. Since the temperature follows a chaotic pattern, it is difficult to determine the exact probability without more information about the distribution or the value of k.\n\nHowever, we can make a qualitative observation: since the temperature oscillates around the mean value of 20°C, it is more likely for the temperature to be closer to the mean than farther away from it. Therefore, the probability of the temperature being between 18°C and 22°C tomorrow should be relatively high, but we cannot determine the exact probability without more information."
