    "message_2": "To determine the value of $d$ such that the system becomes ill-conditioned, we first need to find when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is close to zero. The coefficient matrix is:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of $A$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 1(12 - 6) - 2(6 - 2) + 1(6 - 6) = 6 - 8 + 0 = -2\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the third equation with the perturbation $d$:\n\n\\[\nx + 3y + 3z = 9 + d\n\\]\n\nIf we subtract the first equation from the third equation, we get:\n\n\\[\ny + 2z = 3 + d\n\\]\n\nFor the system to be ill-conditioned, we want the second equation to be a multiple of this new equation. This means that the determinant of the matrix will be close to zero, making the system sensitive to small changes in the input. The second equation is:\n\n\\[\n2x + 4y + 2z = 12\n\\]\n\nDividing the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n\\[\nx + 2y + z = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we want the new equation $y + 2z = 3 + d$ to be a multiple of this equation. If we subtract the new equation from the first equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nx - y - z = 3 - d\n\\]\n\nFor the system to be ill-conditioned, we want $3 - d = 6$. Solving for $d$, we get:\n\n\\[\nd = -3\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the value of $d$, we can find the solution to the system using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. The augmented matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 1 & 6 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 2 & 12 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 3 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we swap the second and third rows to have the largest pivot element in the first column:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 3 & 6 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 2 & 12 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, we eliminate the first column below the pivot element:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 3 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -2 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, we swap the second and third rows to have the largest pivot element in the second column:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 3 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -2 & -4 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, we eliminate the second column below the pivot element:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 3 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSince the last row is all zeros, we have a free variable. Let $z = t$, where $t$ is a parameter. Then, we can solve the second equation for $y$:\n\n\\[\ny = -2t\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can solve the first equation for $x$:\n\n\\[\nx = 6 - 3y - 3z = 6 - 3(-2t) - 3t = 6 + 6t - 3t = 6 + 3t\n\\]\n\nSo, the solution to the system is:\n\n\\[\nx = 6 + 3t, \\quad y = -2t, \\quad z = t\n\\]"
