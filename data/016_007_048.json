    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In the first iteration, a 3x3x3 cube has its central cube and the central cubes of each face removed, leaving 20 smaller cubes. In the second iteration, the same process is applied to each of the remaining smaller cubes, and so on.\n\nTo find the volume of a Menger sponge after the third iteration, we need to determine how many smaller cubes remain after each iteration and then sum up their volumes.\n\n1st iteration:\n- Original cube volume: 1\n- Number of smaller cubes remaining: 20\n- Volume of each smaller cube: (1/3)^3 = 1/27\n- Total volume after 1st iteration: 20 * (1/27)\n\n2nd iteration:\n- Number of smaller cubes remaining: 20^2 = 400\n- Volume of each smaller cube: (1/27)^3 = 1/19683\n- Total volume after 2nd iteration: 400 * (1/19683)\n\n3rd iteration:\n- Number of smaller cubes remaining: 20^3 = 8000\n- Volume of each smaller cube: (1/19683)^3 = 1/7,625,597,484,987\n- Total volume after 3rd iteration: 8000 * (1/7,625,597,484,987)\n\nNow, we sum up the volumes after each iteration:\n\nTotal volume = (20 * 1/27) + (400 * 1/19683) + (8000 * 1/7,625,597,484,987)\nTotal volume ≈ 0.7407407407 + 0.02032520325 + 0.001049317943\n\nTotal volume ≈ 0.7621151619\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge after the third iteration is approximately 0.7621151619."
