    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring is 0.05. If a sample of 500 products is randomly selected from the production line, what is the probability that less than 25 products will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula or the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Since the sample size is large (n = 500), we will use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution:\n\nμ = n * p = 500 * 0.05 = 25\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p)) = sqrt(500 * 0.05 * 0.95) ≈ 4.87\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that less than 25 products will have the defect, which means we want to find P(X < 25). To do this, we will standardize the value and use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution):\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ = (24.5 - 25) / 4.87 ≈ -0.10 (We use 24.5 instead of 25 to account for continuity correction)\n\nNow, we can look up the probability of this Z-score in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the cumulative probability:\n\nP(Z < -0.10) ≈ 0.4602\n\nSo, the probability that less than 25 products will have the defect is approximately 0.4602 or 46.02%."
