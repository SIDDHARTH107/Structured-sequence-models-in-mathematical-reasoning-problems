    "message_1": "A school runs a program to give extra credit to students who complete a certain number of assignments. In a class of 30 students, the teacher has noticed that every student who has completed at least 8 assignments has scored an A in the class. Using inductive logic, what is the probability that a student who has completed 9 assignments or more will score an A?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I must clarify that inductive logic cannot provide an exact probability. However, we can make an informed assumption based on the given information.\n\nSince every student who has completed at least 8 assignments has scored an A, it is reasonable to assume that a student who has completed 9 assignments or more will have a high probability of scoring an A as well. This is because completing more assignments generally indicates a better understanding of the material and a higher level of engagement in the class.\n\nHowever, without more information about the distribution of grades and the number of assignments completed by students, we cannot provide an exact probability."
