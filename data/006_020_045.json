If a family is chosen at random, what is the probability that they have at least one member who attends community events regularly? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability, we need to divide the number of families with at least one member who regularly attends community events by the total number of families in the community.\n\nProbability = (Number of families with at least one member attending events) / (Total number of families)\n\nProbability = 200 / 500\n\nProbability = 0.4\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the probability is 0.40 or 40%."
