    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.\n\nLet's check the smallest Sophie Germain primes and see if they are palindromes:\n\n1. p = 2: 2p + 1 = 5 (both prime), but 2 is not a palindrome.\n2. p = 3: 2p + 1 = 7 (both prime), but 3 is not a palindrome.\n3. p = 5: 2p + 1 = 11 (both prime), and 5 is a palindrome.\n\nTherefore, the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a palindrome is 5."
