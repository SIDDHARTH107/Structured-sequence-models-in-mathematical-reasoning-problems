    "message_1": "A helicopter hovers at a height of 100 meters above the ground. It sees a car which is 400 meters away from the helicopter. What is the straight-line distance between the helicopter and the car, to the nearest meter, using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The helicopter is hovering at a height of 100 meters, and the car is 400 meters away horizontally. We can consider this as a right-angled triangle, with the height being one side (100 meters), the horizontal distance being another side (400 meters), and the straight-line distance between the helicopter and the car being the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's denote the straight-line distance as \"d\". According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd^2 = (height)^2 + (horizontal distance)^2\nd^2 = (100)^2 + (400)^2\nd^2 = 10000 + 160000\nd^2 = 170000\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 170000 to get the value of d:\n\nd = √170000 ≈ 412.31\n\nSo, the straight-line distance between the helicopter and the car is approximately 412 meters."
