    "message_2": "To find the value of the binomial coefficient (8,3), we can use the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n = 8, k = 3, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nC(8,3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8,3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nC(8,3) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8,3) = (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8,3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8,3) = 56\n\nSo, the value of the binomial coefficient (8,3) is 56."
