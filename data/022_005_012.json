    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = 3z^2 / (z^2 + 1)^3 at the pole z = i/3, we first need to find the order of the pole. The order of the pole is the number of times the denominator vanishes at the pole. In this case, we have (z^2 + 1)^3 in the denominator. Let's find its order at z = i/3.\n\n(i/3)^2 + 1 = -1/9 + 1 = 8/9 ≠ 0\n\nSince (i/3)^2 + 1 ≠ 0, z = i/3 is not a pole of f(z). Therefore, the residue of f(z) at z = i/3 is 0."
