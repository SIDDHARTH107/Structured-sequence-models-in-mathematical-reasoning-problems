    "message_2": "To solve this Diophantine equation, we will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 7, and then we will find a particular solution for the given equation.\n\nStep 1: Find the GCD of 4 and 7 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n7 = 1 * 4 + 3\n4 = 1 * 3 + 1\n3 = 3 * 1\n\nThe GCD of 4 and 7 is 1.\n\nStep 2: Find a particular solution for the equation.\n\nSince the GCD of 4 and 7 is 1, we can find a particular solution for the equation by using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1 = 4 - 1 * 3\n1 = 4 - 1 * (7 - 1 * 4)\n1 = 2 * 4 - 1 * 7\n\nSo, a particular solution is x = 2 and y = 1.\n\nStep 3: Find the general solution for the equation.\n\nThe general solution for the equation can be found by adding multiples of 7 to x and subtracting the same multiples of 4 from y.\n\nx = 2 + 7t\ny = 1 - 4t\n\nwhere t is an integer.\n\nStep 4: Find the positive integer solutions for x and y.\n\nWe need to find the values of t for which both x and y are positive integers.\n\nFor t = 0, x = 2 and y = 1. (This is the particular solution we found earlier.)\n\nFor t = 1, x = 9 and y = -3. (y is not positive, so this solution is not valid.)\n\nFor t = 2, x = 16 and y = -7. (y is not positive, so this solution is not valid.)\n\nFor t = 3, x = 23 and y = -11. (y is not positive, so this solution is not valid.)\n\nSince the values of x and y are increasing and decreasing, respectively, there are no more positive integer solutions for x and y.\n\nTherefore, the only positive integer solution for the given equation is x = 2 and y = 1."
