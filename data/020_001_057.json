    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of machine time, 1 hour of assembly time, and yields a profit of $100. Each unit of Product B requires 1 hour of machine time, 3 hours of assembly time, and yields a profit of $150. The company has a maximum of 100 machine hours and 75 assembly hours available per day. Determine how many units of each product the company should produce each day to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. Machine hours: 2x + y ≤ 100\n2. Assembly hours: x + 3y ≤ 75\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit:\n\nP = 100x + 150y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 100\ny ≤ -2x + 100\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 75\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 25\n\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 25), (37.5, 12.5), and (50, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 100(0) + 150(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 25) = 100(0) + 150(25) = $3750\n3. P(37.5, 12.5) = 100(37.5) + 150(12.5) = $6250\n4. P(50, 0) = 100(50) + 150(0) = $5000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 37.5 units of Product A and 12.5 units of Product B. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, they should produce 37 units of Product A and 13 units of Product B to maximize profit, which will result in a profit of $6,200."
