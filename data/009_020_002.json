Suppose that the input is given as \n\nu(t) = 2cos(2t)\n\nDetermine the optimal control for this system that minimizes the following cost function: \n\nJ = ∫[0,π](y(t)² + u(t)²)dt\n\nsubject to the initial conditions \n\ny(0) = 0, y'(0) = 0. \n\nWhat is the value of the minimum cost function J?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the calculus of variations and the Pontryagin's minimum principle. First, let's rewrite the given differential equation as a first-order system:\n\nx1(t) = y(t)\nx2(t) = y'(t)\n\nThen, the system can be represented as:\n\nx1'(t) = x2(t)\nx2'(t) = u(t) - 5x2(t) - 6x1(t)\n\nThe cost function can be rewritten as:\n\nJ = ∫[0,π](x1(t)² + u(t)²)dt\n\nNow, we can apply the Pontryagin's minimum principle. Define the Hamiltonian H as:\n\nH(x1, x2, u, p1, p2) = x1² + u² + p1(x2) + p2(u - 5x2 - 6x1)\n\nwhere p1(t) and p2(t) are the costate variables. The necessary conditions for the optimal control are:\n\n1. ∂H/∂u = 0\n2. p1'(t) = -∂H/∂x1\n3. p2'(t) = -∂H/∂x2\n\nFrom condition 1, we get:\n\n2u + p2 = 0\nu = -p2/2\n\nNow, let's find the derivatives of H with respect to x1 and x2:\n\n∂H/∂x1 = -12x1 - 6p2\n∂H/∂x2 = -10x2 + p1 - 5p2\n\nApplying conditions 2 and 3, we get the following system of differential equations:\n\np1'(t) = 12x1(t) + 6p2(t)\np2'(t) = 10x2(t) - p1(t) + 5p2(t)\n\nNow we have a system of 6 first-order differential equations:\n\nx1'(t) = x2(t)\nx2'(t) = -p2(t)/2 - 5x2(t) - 6x1(t)\np1'(t) = 12x1(t) + 6p2(t)\np2'(t) = 10x2(t) - p1(t) + 5p2(t)\n\nwith initial conditions:\n\nx1(0) = 0\nx2(0) = 0\np1(π) = 0\np2(π) = 0\n\nTo find the optimal control, we need to solve this boundary value problem. This can be done numerically using various methods, such as the shooting method or the finite difference method. Once the optimal control u(t) is found, we can calculate the minimum cost function J by integrating the cost function with the optimal control:\n\nJ = ∫[0,π](x1(t)² + u(t)²)dt\n\nDue to the complexity of the problem, it is not possible to provide an exact value for the minimum cost function J without solving the boundary value problem numerically."
