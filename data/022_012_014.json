    "message_2": "To find the singularities of f(z), we first look for the points where the denominator is zero. That is, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis equation has two complex solutions:\n\nz = i and z = -i\n\nNow, we need to classify each singularity as a pole or a removable singularity. A singularity is a pole if the limit of the function as z approaches the singularity does not exist or is infinite. A singularity is removable if the limit exists and is finite.\n\nFor z = i:\n\nf(z) = 3z / (z^2 + 1) = 3i / (i^2 + 1) = 3i / (-1 + 1) = 3i / 0\n\nThe limit does not exist, so z = i is a pole.\n\nFor z = -i:\n\nf(z) = 3z / (z^2 + 1) = -3i / ((-i)^2 + 1) = -3i / (-1 + 1) = -3i / 0\n\nThe limit does not exist, so z = -i is a pole.\n\nNow, we need to compute the residues of f(z) at each of its poles. The residue of a meromorphic function at a simple pole z = z0 is given by:\n\nRes(f, z0) = lim (z -> z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\nFor z = i:\n\nRes(f, i) = lim (z -> i) [(z - i) * (3z / (z^2 + 1))]\n= lim (z -> i) [3z(z - i) / (z^2 + 1 - z^2 + 2zi - i^2)]\n= lim (z -> i) [3z(z - i) / (2zi)]\n= 3i / 2\n\nFor z = -i:\n\nRes(f, -i) = lim (z -> -i) [(z + i) * (3z / (z^2 + 1))]\n= lim (z -> -i) [3z(z + i) / (z^2 + 1 - z^2 - 2zi - i^2)]\n= lim (z -> -i) [3z(z + i) / (-2zi)]\n= -3i / 2\n\nSo, the residues of f(z) at its poles are:\n\nRes(f, i) = 3i / 2\nRes(f, -i) = -3i / 2"
