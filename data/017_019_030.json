    "message_2": "To find all possible non-abelian groups of order 36, we first note that 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of these groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 36. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 9. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nWe consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. The intersection of P_2 and P_3 is trivial, so G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 is isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2, and P_3 is isomorphic to C9, G is isomorphic to either C4 × C9 or (C2 × C2) × C9. Both of these groups are abelian, so we discard this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four 3-Sylow subgroups. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the 3-Sylow subgroups. Then, the action of G on the set of 3-Sylow subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism φ: G → S_4. The kernel of φ contains P_2, and since |G| = 36 and |S_4| = 24, the image of φ has order at most 3. Thus, the image of φ is isomorphic to either C3 or A4.\n\nIf the image of φ is isomorphic to C3, then G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, denoted as P_2 ⋊ P_3. Since P_2 is isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2, we have two possible non-abelian groups: C4 ⋊ C9 and (C2 × C2) ⋊ C9.\n\nIf the image of φ is isomorphic to A4, then G contains a subgroup isomorphic to A4. Since A4 is non-abelian of order 12, this gives a non-abelian group of order 36 that is an extension of A4 by C3, denoted as A4 ⋊ C3.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has nine 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. The action of G on the set of 2-Sylow subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism ψ: G → S_9. The kernel of ψ contains P_3, and since |G| = 36 and |S_9| = 362880, the image of ψ has order at most 4. Thus, the image of ψ is isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2.\n\nHowever, both of these cases lead to abelian groups, so we discard this case.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three non-abelian groups of order 36 up to isomorphism: C4 ⋊ C9, (C2 × C2) ⋊ C9, and A4 ⋊ C3. We have shown that there are no other distinct groups of order 36 that are not isomorphic to these three non-abelian groups or the abelian groups C36 and A4 × C3."
