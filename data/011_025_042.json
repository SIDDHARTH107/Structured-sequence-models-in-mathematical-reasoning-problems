    "message_1": "In a game of Nim, Player 1 begins with a pile of 21 stones. Each player can remove 1 to 4 stones from the pile, and the player who removes the last stone wins. If neither player makes a mistake, who will win the game?",
    "message_2": "To determine the winner, we can use the strategy of Nim, which is based on the concept of Nim-sum (the bitwise XOR operation of the sizes of the piles). In this case, there is only one pile with 21 stones.\n\nThe winning strategy is to leave the opponent with a Nim-sum of 0. To do this, we need to find the number of stones that should be removed to make the Nim-sum 0. Since there is only one pile, the Nim-sum is simply the number of stones in the pile, which is 21.\n\nNow, let's find the number of stones to remove:\n\n21 XOR 0 = 21\n\nSince 21 is not in the range of 1 to 4, Player 1 cannot make the Nim-sum 0 in their first move. Therefore, Player 2 can always make the Nim-sum 0 in their move, following the optimal strategy. If both players play optimally, Player 2 will win the game."
