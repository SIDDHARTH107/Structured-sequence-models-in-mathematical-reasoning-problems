    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the phase shift for the trigonometric function f(x) = 2cos(x-π/3). What is the value of the phase shift?",
    "message_2": "The phase shift of a trigonometric function is the horizontal shift applied to the function. In the given function f(x) = 2cos(x - π/3), the phase shift can be found inside the cosine function as the value being subtracted from x.\n\nIn this case, the phase shift is π/3."
