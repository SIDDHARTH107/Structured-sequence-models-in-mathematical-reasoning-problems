    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit and k is the frequency variable.\n\nLet's denote the Fourier transform of y(x) as Y(k). Then, the Fourier transform of y'(x) is ikY(k), and the Fourier transform of y''(x) is -k^2Y(k). Now, we can find the Fourier transform of the given differential equation:\n\n-k^2Y(k) + 4Y(k) = 6F{sin(2x)}\n\nThe Fourier transform of sin(2x) is given by:\n\nF{sin(2x)} = √(π/2) * [δ(k - 2) - δ(k + 2)]\n\nwhere δ(k) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in terms of Y(k):\n\nY(k) * (-k^2 + 4) = 6√(π/2) * [δ(k - 2) - δ(k + 2)]\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(k):\n\nY(k) = 6√(π/2) * [δ(k - 2) - δ(k + 2)] / (-k^2 + 4)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(k) to get y(x):\n\ny(x) = F^(-1){Y(k)}\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[6√(π/2) * [δ(k - 2) - δ(k + 2)] / (-k^2 + 4) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * [6√(π/2)] * [∫[δ(k - 2) / (-k^2 + 4) * e^(ikx)] dk - ∫[δ(k + 2) / (-k^2 + 4) * e^(ikx)] dk]\n\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, we can evaluate the integrals:\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * [6√(π/2)] * [e^(2ix) / (-2^2 + 4) - e^(-2ix) / (2^2 + 4)]\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * [6√(π/2)] * [e^(2ix) / 0 - e^(-2ix) / 8]\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * [6√(π/2)] * [- e^(-2ix) / 8]\n\ny(x) = -3√(π/2) * e^(-2ix) / 4\n\nNow, we can apply the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = -3√(π/2) * e^(0) / 4 = 1\n\n-3√(π/2) / 4 = 1\n\n√(π/2) = -4/3\n\nThis is a contradiction since the square root of a positive number cannot be negative. Therefore, there is no solution to the given differential equation with the given initial conditions using the Fourier transform method."
