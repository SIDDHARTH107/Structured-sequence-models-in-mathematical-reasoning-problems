    "message_2": "To find the possible Cayley tables for a group of order 4, we first note that there are two groups of order 4 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4. We will construct the Cayley tables for each of these groups and then determine whether each group is isomorphic to C4 or V4.\n\nLet's denote the elements of C4 as {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element and a is a generator of the group. The Cayley table for C4 is:\n\n```\n   e   a   a^2 a^3\ne  e   a   a^2 a^3\na  a  a^2  a^3  e\na^2 a^2 a^3  e   a\na^3 a^3 e   a  a^2\n```\n\nNow let's denote the elements of V4 as {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c are elements of order 2. The Cayley table for V4 is:\n\n```\n   e  a  b  c\ne  e  a  b  c\na  a  e  c  b\nb  b  c  e  a\nc  c  b  a  e\n```\n\nNow we can determine whether each group is isomorphic to C4 or V4 by comparing their Cayley tables.\n\nThe Cayley table for C4 has a cyclic structure, with each element being generated by repeated multiplication of the generator a. This table is clearly different from the table for V4, which has a more symmetric structure with all non-identity elements having order 2. Therefore, C4 is not isomorphic to V4.\n\nThe Cayley table for V4 has a symmetric structure with all non-identity elements having order 2. This table is clearly different from the table for C4, which has a cyclic structure with each element being generated by repeated multiplication of the generator a. Therefore, V4 is not isomorphic to C4.\n\nIn conclusion, the two possible Cayley tables for a group of order 4 are those for the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4. These two groups are not isomorphic to each other."
