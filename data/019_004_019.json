    "message_1": "A car is traveling at a speed of 60 mph. How long will it take for the car to travel a distance of 200 miles? Use temporal logic to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using temporal logic, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 200 miles and the speed is 60 mph. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nTime = 200 miles / 60 mph\n\nTime = 3.333 hours\n\nSo, it will take approximately 3.333 hours for the car to travel a distance of 200 miles at a speed of 60 mph."
