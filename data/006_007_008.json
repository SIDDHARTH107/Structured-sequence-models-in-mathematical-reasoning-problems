    "message_1": "Suppose a stock is known to have a daily return that follows a normal distribution with a mean of 0.5% and a standard deviation of 1.2%. What is the probability that the stock will increase in price by at least 2% in a given day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock will increase in price by at least 2% in a given day, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use the standard normal distribution table (Z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (in this case, 2% or 0.02), μ is the mean (0.5% or 0.005), and σ is the standard deviation (1.2% or 0.012).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (0.02 - 0.005) / 0.012\nz ≈ 1.25\n\nNow, we can use the Z-table to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 1.25. Looking up 1.25 in the Z-table, we find a probability of 0.211.\n\nHowever, this value represents the probability that the z-score is less than 1.25. Since we want to find the probability that the stock will increase by at least 2%, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 1.25. To do this, we can subtract the probability we found from 1:\n\nP(Z > 1.25) = 1 - P(Z < 1.25)\nP(Z > 1.25) = 1 - 0.211\nP(Z > 1.25) ≈ 0.789\n\nSo, there is approximately a 78.9% chance that the stock will increase in price by at least 2% in a given day."
