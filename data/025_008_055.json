    "message_2": "1. The Hodge decomposition and Dolbeault cohomology groups are concepts from algebraic geometry and complex analysis, which are not directly related to the given algebraic equation. Therefore, applying the Hodge decomposition to the Dolbeault cohomology groups of the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is not relevant to the problem at hand.\n\n2. To find the sum of all the roots of the given algebraic equation, we can use Vieta's formulas. For a cubic equation of the form:\n$$z^3 + az^2 + bz + c = 0$$\nThe sum of the roots is given by $-a$. In our case, the equation is:\n$$z^3 - 3z^2 + 4z - 12 = 0$$\nSo, the sum of all the roots is $-(-3) = 3$."
