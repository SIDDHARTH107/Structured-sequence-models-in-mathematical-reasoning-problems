Let $H^{p,q}(X;\\mathbb{C})$ denote the $(p,q)$-th Hodge cohomology group of $X$. If $h^{p,q}(X)$ denotes its dimension, then show that $\\Sigma h^{p,q}(X) = 2^n$. \n\nFind the sum of the dimensions of all Hodge cohomology groups of $X$ provided that $X$ is a Kähler manifold of complex dimension 3.",
    "message_2": "To show that $\\Sigma h^{p,q}(X) = 2^n$, we will use the Hodge decomposition theorem. The Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a Kähler manifold $X$, the cohomology groups $H^k(X;\\mathbb{C})$ can be decomposed as a direct sum of the Hodge cohomology groups:\n\n$$H^k(X;\\mathbb{C}) = \\bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(X;\\mathbb{C}).$$\n\nNow, we know that the total dimension of the cohomology groups $H^k(X;\\mathbb{C})$ is given by the Betti numbers $b_k(X)$. By the Künneth formula, we have:\n\n$$b_k(X) = \\sum_{p+q=k} h^{p,q}(X).$$\n\nSince $X$ is a complex projective manifold of complex dimension $n$, the total cohomology group $H^*(X;\\mathbb{C})$ has dimension $2^n$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\Sigma h^{p,q}(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2n} b_k(X) = 2^n.$$\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the dimensions of all Hodge cohomology groups of $X$ provided that $X$ is a Kähler manifold of complex dimension 3. In this case, $n = 3$, so:\n\n$$\\Sigma h^{p,q}(X) = 2^3 = 8.$$\n\nThus, the sum of the dimensions of all Hodge cohomology groups of $X$ is 8."
