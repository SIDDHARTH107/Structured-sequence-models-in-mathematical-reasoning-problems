    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nFor a circle with a radius of 6 cm, the circumference would be:\n\nC = 2π(6 cm)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 6 cm\nC ≈ 37.699 cm\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 37.699 cm."
