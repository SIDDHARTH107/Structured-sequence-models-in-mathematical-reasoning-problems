    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the two points $P_1=(1,0,0)$ and $P_2=(0,1,-1)$, we can use the parametric form of the line equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx = 1 - t \\\\\ny = t \\\\\nz = -t\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $t$ is a parameter.\n\nNow, we want to find the third point $P_3$ on this line that also lies on the variety $V$. To do this, we can substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equations defining $V$:\n\n1. $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$:\n\n$$\n(1 - t)^2 + t^2 + (-t)^2 = 1\n$$\n\n2. $x+y+z=0$:\n\n$$\n(1 - t) + t + (-t) = 0\n$$\n\nSolving the second equation, we get:\n\n$$\n1 - t = 0 \\Rightarrow t = 1\n$$\n\nNow, substitute this value of $t$ into the first equation:\n\n$$\n(1 - 1)^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 = 1\n$$\n\n$$\n0^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 = 1\n$$\n\n$$\n1 = 1\n$$\n\nSince this equation holds true, the third point $P_3$ lies on the variety $V$. Now, we can find the coordinates of $P_3$ by substituting $t=1$ into the parametric equations of the line:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx = 1 - 1 = 0 \\\\\ny = 1 \\\\\nz = -1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSo, $P_3 = (0, 1, -1)$.\n\nFinally, the equation of the line passing through $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ can be written in parametric form as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx = 1 - t \\\\\ny = t \\\\\nz = -t\n\\end{cases}\n$$"
