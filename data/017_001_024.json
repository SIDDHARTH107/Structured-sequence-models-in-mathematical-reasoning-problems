    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4. We want to show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group of order 4 (C4) or the Klein four-group (V4).\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of groups of order 4:\n\n1. Every group of order 4 is either cyclic or isomorphic to V4.\n2. A group of order 4 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 4.\n3. A group of order 4 is isomorphic to V4 if and only if all of its non-identity elements have order 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of G. Since G has order 4, by the properties above, it must have either an element of order 4 or all of its non-identity elements must have order 2.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet g be an element of order 4 in G. Then, G = {e, g, g^2, g^3}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is cyclic and generated by g, so G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements of G have order 2.\nLet G = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c are the non-identity elements. Since all non-identity elements have order 2, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. Also, since G is a group, it must be closed under the group operation. Therefore, the product of any two distinct non-identity elements must be the remaining non-identity element. That is, ab = c, bc = a, and ac = b. This is precisely the structure of the Klein four-group V4. Thus, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, depending on whether it has an element of order 4 or all of its non-identity elements have order 2."
