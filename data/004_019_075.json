    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car after 10 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (which is 0 since the car starts from rest), a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nv = 0 + (5 m/s²)(10 s)\n\nv = 50 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the car after 10 seconds is 50 m/s.\n\nSince the car accelerates at a constant rate, its acceleration at that moment is still 5 m/s²."
