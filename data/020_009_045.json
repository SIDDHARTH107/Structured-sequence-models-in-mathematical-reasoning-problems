    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Stochastic Optimization:\n\nSuppose you are running a manufacturing plant that produces a certain product. The production process is subject to random fluctuations due to uncertainty in the availability of raw materials and equipment failures. You want to optimize the production process to maximize profits over a given time horizon. The production process can be modeled as a stochastic dynamic program.\n\nGiven the following information, what is the optimal production policy and expected profit over a 6-month time horizon? Assume that the objective is to maximize total profit, and that the production process is described by the following parameters:\n\n- The plant has 2 machines that can produce the product, and each machine can produce up to 2000 units per month.\n- The demand for the product varies each month, and is modeled as a random variable with the following probability distribution: \n\n| Demand (units) | Probability |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| 1000           | 0.1         |\n| 2000           | 0.4         |\n| 3000           | 0.3         |\n| 4000           | 0.2         |\n\n- The cost of producing each unit of the product is $5.\n- The price at which the product can be sold varies depending on demand, according to the following table:\n\n| Demand (units) | Price ($) |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| 1000           | 10        |\n| 2000           | 8         |\n| 3000           | 7         |\n| 4000           | 6         | \n\nAssume that there are no fixed costs associated with production, and that unsatisfied demand cannot be carried over to future periods.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production policy and expected profit over a 6-month time horizon, we can calculate the expected profit for each possible production level (0 to 4000 units) and choose the production level that maximizes the expected profit. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected profit for each demand scenario:\n\n1. Demand = 1000 units\n   - Production = 1000 units: Profit = (10 - 5) * 1000 = $5,000\n   - Production = 2000 units: Profit = (10 - 5) * 1000 - 5 * 1000 = $0 (since unsatisfied demand cannot be carried over)\n   - Production = 3000 units: Profit = -$5,000 (similarly)\n   - Production = 4000 units: Profit = -$10,000 (similarly)\n\n2. Demand = 2000 units\n   - Production = 1000 units: Profit = (8 - 5) * 1000 = $3,000\n   - Production = 2000 units: Profit = (8 - 5) * 2000 = $6,000\n   - Production = 3000 units: Profit = (8 - 5) * 2000 - 5 * 1000 = $1,000\n   - Production = 4000 units: Profit = -$4,000\n\n3. Demand = 3000 units\n   - Production = 1000 units: Profit = (7 - 5) * 1000 = $2,000\n   - Production = 2000 units: Profit = (7 - 5) * 2000 = $4,000\n   - Production = 3000 units: Profit = (7 - 5) * 3000 = $6,000\n   - Production = 4000 units: Profit = (7 - 5) * 3000 - 5 * 1000 = $1,000\n\n4. Demand = 4000 units\n   - Production = 1000 units: Profit = (6 - 5) * 1000 = $1,000\n   - Production = 2000 units: Profit = (6 - 5) * 2000 = $2,000\n   - Production = 3000 units: Profit = (6 - 5) * 3000 = $3,000\n   - Production = 4000 units: Profit = (6 - 5) * 4000 = $4,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for each production level:\n\n- Production = 1000 units: Expected Profit = 0.1 * $5,000 + 0.4 * $3,000 + 0.3 * $2,000 + 0.2 * $1,000 = $2,900\n- Production = 2000 units: Expected Profit = 0.1 * $0 + 0.4 * $6,000 + 0.3 * $4,000 + 0.2 * $2,000 = $3,800\n- Production = 3000 units: Expected Profit = 0.1 * -$5,000 + 0.4 * $1,000 + 0.3 * $6,000 + 0.2 * $1,000 = $1,700\n- Production = 4000 units: Expected Profit = 0.1 * -$10,000 + 0.4 * -$4,000 + 0.3 * $1,000 + 0.2 * $4,000 = -$2,000\n\nThe optimal production policy is to produce 2000 units per month, as it has the highest expected profit of $3,800 per month. Over a 6-month time horizon, the expected profit would be 6 * $3,800 = $22,800."
