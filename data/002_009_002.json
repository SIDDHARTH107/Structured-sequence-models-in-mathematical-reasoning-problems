    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 6 meters and a radius of 2 meters. What is the surface area of the cylinder?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area (the area of the side). The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the height (h) is 6 meters and the radius (r) is 2 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(2)² + 2π(2)(6)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(4) + 2π(12)\n\nSurface Area = 8π + 24π\n\nSurface Area = 32π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 32 * 3.14\n\nSurface Area ≈ 100.48 square meters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 100.48 square meters."
