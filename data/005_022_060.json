    "message_2": "To calculate the mean and median after removing the outlier, we first need to find the sum of the original data set and then subtract the outlier.\n\nThe original mean is 30, and there are 10 data points, so the sum of the original data set is:\n\nSum = Mean * Number of data points = 30 * 10 = 300\n\nNow, we subtract the outlier (100) from the sum:\n\nSum without outlier = 300 - 100 = 200\n\nSince there are now 9 data points after removing the outlier, we can find the new mean:\n\nNew mean = Sum without outlier / Number of data points without outlier = 200 / 9 â‰ˆ 22.22\n\nNow, let's find the new median. The original median is 28, which means that the middle value of the sorted data set is 28. Since the outlier (100) is greater than the median, removing it will not change the position of the middle value. Therefore, the new median remains the same:\n\nNew median = 28\n\nSo, after removing the outlier, the mean is approximately 22.22, and the median is 28."
