Each seller knows the true quality of their product, but buyers do not. Assume that buyers are willing to pay $7 for a high-quality product and $3 for a low-quality product.\n\na) What is the expected value of a high-quality product for a seller?\nb) What is the expected value of a low-quality product for a seller?\nc) What is the expected value for a seller who has information asymmetry and only knows the probability of having a high-quality product?\nd) What is the optimal price for a seller who knows they have a high-quality product?\ne) What is the optimal price for a seller who knows they have a low-quality product?",
    "message_2": "a) The expected value of a high-quality product for a seller is the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for it, which is $7.\n\nb) The expected value of a low-quality product for a seller is the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for it, which is $3.\n\nc) The expected value for a seller who has information asymmetry and only knows the probability of having a high-quality product can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected value = (probability of high-quality product * expected value of high-quality product) + (probability of low-quality product * expected value of low-quality product)\n\nExpected value = (0.5 * $7) + (0.5 * $3) = $3.5 + $1.5 = $5\n\nd) The optimal price for a seller who knows they have a high-quality product is the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for a high-quality product, which is $7.\n\ne) The optimal price for a seller who knows they have a low-quality product is the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for a low-quality product, which is $3."
