    "message_1": "A company has developed four new products and wants to maximize its profit by determining the optimal product mix to produce and sell. Product A earns a profit of $5 per unit, product B earns a profit of $4 per unit, product C earns a profit of $7 per unit, and product D earns a profit of $6 per unit. However, due to resource limitations, the company can only produce a maximum of 500 units. \n\nAs a math student, what is the optimal product mix that maximizes the company's profit, and what is the maximum profit that the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, the company should focus on producing the product with the highest profit per unit, which is product C at $7 per unit. Since the company can only produce a maximum of 500 units, they should produce 500 units of product C.\n\nThe maximum profit the company can earn is calculated as follows:\n\nMaximum profit = (Number of units of product C) * (Profit per unit of product C)\nMaximum profit = 500 * $7\nMaximum profit = $3,500\n\nSo, the optimal product mix is to produce 500 units of product C, and the maximum profit the company can earn is $3,500."
