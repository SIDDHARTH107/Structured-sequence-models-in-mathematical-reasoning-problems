    "message_1": "A company manufactures two types of products, A and B. The production of each product requires the use of three machines: X, Y, and Z. The time required on each machine for each product is shown in the table below:\n\n| Product | Machine X (hours) | Machine Y (hours) | Machine Z (hours) |\n|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| A       | 1                | 2                | 2                |\n| B       | 3                | 1                | 2                |\n\nThe company has 200 hours of Machine X, 150 hours of Machine Y, and 180 hours of Machine Z available per week. Each unit of Product A brings a profit of $20, and each unit of Product B brings a profit of $30.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can earn per week assuming they can only produce whole numbers of each product?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced per week. The constraints for the machines are:\n\n1x + 3y ≤ 200 (Machine X)\n2x + 1y ≤ 150 (Machine Y)\n2x + 2y ≤ 180 (Machine Z)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. Machine X constraint:\ny ≤ (200 - x) / 3\n\n2. Machine Y constraint:\ny ≤ 150 - 2x\n\n3. Machine Z constraint:\ny ≤ (180 - 2x) / 2\ny ≤ 90 - x\n\nNow we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersections of the constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of Machine X and Machine Y constraints:\nx + 3y = 200\n2x + y = 150\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 50 and y = 50.\n\n2. Intersection of Machine X and Machine Z constraints:\nx + 3y = 200\nx + y = 90\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 60 and y = 30.\n\n3. Intersection of Machine Y and Machine Z constraints:\n2x + y = 150\nx + y = 90\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 60 and y = 30. This is the same point as the intersection of Machine X and Machine Z constraints.\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(50, 50) = 20(50) + 30(50) = 1000 + 1500 = $2500\n2. P(60, 30) = 20(60) + 30(30) = 1200 + 900 = $2100\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (50, 50), with a profit of $2500 per week. The company should produce 50 units of Product A and 50 units of Product B per week to maximize their profit."
