    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Determine the number of possible divisors for each prime factor: For 2, we have divisors 1, 2, 4, and 8. For 3, we have divisors 1, 3, and 9.\n3. Calculate the number of groups for each prime factor using the formula n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1), where n_p is the number of groups, p is the prime factor, and k is the highest power of the prime factor dividing the order of the group. For p = 2, n_2 = (2^(3+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 15. For p = 3, n_3 = (3^(2+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = 13.\n4. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n = (n_2 * n_3) / gcd(n_2, n_3), where gcd is the greatest common divisor. In this case, gcd(15, 13) = 1. Therefore, the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72 is (15 * 13) / 1 = 195."
