    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid (also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron) is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral tetrahedron into four smaller equilateral tetrahedra. In this problem, we are asked to find the total number of triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid with 3 iterations.\n\nIteration 0: The initial pyramid has 1 equilateral triangle as its base and 4 triangles in total (including the 3 side triangles).\n\nIteration 1: Each of the 4 triangles from iteration 0 is replaced by 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n\nIteration 2: Each of the 16 triangles from iteration 1 is replaced by 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 16 * 4 = 64 triangles.\n\nIteration 3: Each of the 64 triangles from iteration 2 is replaced by 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 64 * 4 = 256 triangles.\n\nSo, the total number of triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid with 3 iterations is 256."
