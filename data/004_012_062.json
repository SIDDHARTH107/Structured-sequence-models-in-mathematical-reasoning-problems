    "message_2": "The quotient rule states that if we have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\n\nIn this case, we have g(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 2 and h(x) = x. First, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d(3x^2 + 4x + 2)/dx = 6x + 4\nh'(x) = d(x)/dx = 1\n\nNow we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\nf'(x) = ((6x + 4) * x - (3x^2 + 4x + 2) * 1) / x^2\n\nNow we can find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = ((6 * 2 + 4) * 2 - (3 * 2^2 + 4 * 2 + 2) * 1) / 2^2\nf'(2) = ((12 + 4) * 2 - (12 + 8 + 2)) / 4\nf'(2) = (16 * 2 - 22) / 4\nf'(2) = (32 - 22) / 4\nf'(2) = 10 / 4\nf'(2) = 5/2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 4x + 2) / x at x = 2 using the quotient rule is 5/2."
