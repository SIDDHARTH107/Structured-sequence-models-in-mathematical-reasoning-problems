    "message_2": "To find the vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2 and b = -4, so:\n\nx = -(-4) / (2 * 2) = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) - 3 = 2 - 4 - 3 = -5\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 4x - 3 is (1, -5)."
