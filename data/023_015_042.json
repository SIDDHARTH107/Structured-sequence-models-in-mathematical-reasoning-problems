    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω), we need to compute the following integral:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[F(ω) * e^(iωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nFirst, let's rewrite F(ω) as a sum of simpler fractions:\n\nF(ω) = A/(1 - 4ω^2) + B/(25 - 4ω^2) + C/(49 - 4ω^2)\n\nWe can find A, B, and C by comparing the coefficients:\n\nA = 1/π, B = -1/π, C = 1/π\n\nNow, we can rewrite F(ω) as:\n\nF(ω) = (1/π)/(1 - 4ω^2) - (1/π)/(25 - 4ω^2) + (1/π)/(49 - 4ω^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[((1/π)/(1 - 4ω^2) - (1/π)/(25 - 4ω^2) + (1/π)/(49 - 4ω^2)) * e^(iωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nEach term in the integral can be solved using the residue theorem. The residues of the poles are given by:\n\nResidue at ω = ±1/2: ±(1/π) * e^(±it/2)\nResidue at ω = ±1/2 * sqrt(6): ∓(1/π) * e^(±it/2 * sqrt(6))\nResidue at ω = ±1/2 * sqrt(14): ±(1/π) * e^(±it/2 * sqrt(14))\n\nNow, we can sum up the residues and multiply by 2πi:\n\nf(t) = (1/π) * (e^(it/2) - e^(-it/2) - e^(it/2 * sqrt(6)) + e^(-it/2 * sqrt(6)) + e^(it/2 * sqrt(14)) - e^(-it/2 * sqrt(14)))\n\nFinally, we can simplify f(t) using the Euler's formula:\n\nf(t) = (2/π) * (sin(t/2) - sin(t/2 * sqrt(6)) + sin(t/2 * sqrt(14)))\n\nSo, the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω) is:\n\nf(t) = (2/π) * (sin(t/2) - sin(t/2 * sqrt(6)) + sin(t/2 * sqrt(14)))"
