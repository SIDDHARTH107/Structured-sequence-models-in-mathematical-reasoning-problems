    "message_2": "To show that the primality testing problem is in the complexity class P, we need to devise an algorithm that can determine whether a number is prime or composite in polynomial time. One such algorithm is the AKS primality test, which was discovered by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena in 2002. However, for simplicity, we will use a slightly less efficient algorithm that is still polynomial in the size of the input number.\n\nThe algorithm we will use is based on trial division. Given an input number n, we will check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of n. If we find a divisor, then n is composite; otherwise, it is prime. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(n)), which is polynomial in the size of the input number (i.e., the number of bits required to represent n).\n\nHere is the algorithm in pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2 or n == 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i from 3 to sqrt(n) with step 2:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis algorithm checks if n is divisible by any odd integer from 3 to the square root of n. If it finds a divisor, it returns False, indicating that n is composite. If it doesn't find any divisors, it returns True, indicating that n is prime.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(n)), which is polynomial in the size of the input number. To see why, consider that the size of the input number is the number of bits required to represent n, which is log2(n). Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(sqrt(2^(log2(n)))) = O(2^(log2(n)/2)), which is polynomial in the size of the input number.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the primality testing problem is in the complexity class P by devising an algorithm that can determine whether a number is prime or composite in polynomial time."
