    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can write a Python program that iterates through the 10,000 points and applies the affine transformations with their respective probabilities. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef f1(x, y):\n    return (0, 0.16 * y)\n\ndef f2(x, y):\n    return (0.85 * x + 0.04 * y, -0.04 * x + 0.85 * y + 1.6)\n\ndef f3(x, y):\n    return (0.2 * x - 0.26 * y, 0.23 * x + 0.22 * y + 1.6)\n\ndef f4(x, y):\n    return (-0.15 * x + 0.28 * y, 0.26 * x + 0.24 * y + 0.44)\n\ndef apply_transform(x, y):\n    r = random.random()\n    if r < 0.01:\n        return f1(x, y)\n    elif r < 0.86:\n        return f2(x, y)\n    elif r < 0.93:\n        return f3(x, y)\n    else:\n        return f4(x, y)\n\ndef calculate_10000th_point():\n    x, y = 0, 0\n    for _ in range(10000):\n        x, y = apply_transform(x, y)\n    return (x, y)\n\npoint_10000 = calculate_10000th_point()\nprint(point_10000)\n```\n\nThis program defines the four affine transformations and a function to apply them based on their probabilities. It then iterates through the 10,000 points, applying the transformations, and prints the final coordinates of the 10,000th point. Note that the result may vary due to the random nature of the transformations' probabilities."
