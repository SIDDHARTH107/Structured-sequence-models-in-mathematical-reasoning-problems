    "message_2": "To find $f'(3)$, we will first differentiate both sides of the given equation with respect to $x$ using the chain rule. \n\nGiven: $f(x^2) = \\sin(x)$\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$f'(x^2) \\cdot 2x = \\cos(x)$\n\nNow, we want to find $f'(3)$. To do this, we need to find the value of $x$ such that $x^2 = 3$. Since we are dealing with real numbers, we can take the square root of both sides:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of $x$ back into the differentiated equation:\n\n$f'(3) \\cdot 2\\sqrt{3} = \\cos(\\sqrt{3})$\n\nTo find $f'(3)$, we can divide both sides by $2\\sqrt{3}$:\n\n$f'(3) = \\frac{\\cos(\\sqrt{3})}{2\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nSo, the derivative of the function $f(x)$ at $x=3$ is:\n\n$f'(3) = \\frac{\\cos(\\sqrt{3})}{2\\sqrt{3}}$"
