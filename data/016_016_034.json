    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is generated by a recursive process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of the square root of 7.\n\nAfter 6 iterations, the length of the Gosper curve will be:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (sqrt(7))^iterations\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(7))^6\nLength â‰ˆ 1 * 117.649104\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 6 iterations is approximately 117.649104 units."
