So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 7 is:\n\nv1 = [1, 2]\n\nFor λ2 = 2:\n\n(A - λ2I) * x = 0\n\n([[3 - 2, 2], [2, 6 - 2]]) * x = 0\n\n([[1, 2], [2, 4]]) * x = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this as a system of linear equations:\n\nx1 + 2x2 = 0\n2x1 + 4x2 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express x1 in terms of x2:\n\nx1 = -2x2\n\nNow, let x2 = 1, then x1 = -2. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 2 is:\n\nv2 = [-2, 1]\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 7, Eigenvector v1 = [1, 2]\nEigenvalue λ2 = 2, Eigenvector v2 = [-2, 1]"
