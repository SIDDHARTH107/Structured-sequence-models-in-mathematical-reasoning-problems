    "message_2": "In a T1 space, for any two distinct points x and y, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∉ U, and y ∈ V, x ∉ V. In other words, singletons are closed sets in a T1 space.\n\nSince A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X, we can separate each point in A from each point in B using open sets. We need to find the minimum number of open sets needed to separate A and B.\n\nLet's consider one point a ∈ A and one point b ∈ B. By the T1 separation axiom, there exist open sets U_a and V_b such that a ∈ U_a, b ∉ U_a, and b ∈ V_b, a ∉ V_b. We can do this for each of the 10 points in A and each of the 5 points in B.\n\nHowever, we can reuse the open sets for the points in A. For each point a ∈ A, we can find an open set U_a that contains a and does not contain any point from B. Since there are 10 points in A, we need at least 10 open sets to separate A from B.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of open sets needed to separate A and B is 10."
