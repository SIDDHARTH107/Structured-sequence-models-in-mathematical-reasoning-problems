Prove that X is not path-connected.\n\nCould you please clarify if you would like a numerical problem or a question/problem statement as the one above?",
    "message_2": "To prove that X is not path-connected, we need to show that there exist two points in X for which there is no continuous path connecting them.\n\nLet x ∈ A and y ∈ B. Since A and B are disjoint, x ≠ y. We will show that there is no continuous path connecting x and y in X.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a continuous path p: [0, 1] → X such that p(0) = x and p(1) = y. Since p is continuous, the preimages of open sets in X are open in [0, 1]. Let U = p^(-1)(A) and V = p^(-1)(B). Since A and B are open in X, U and V are open in [0, 1].\n\nNotice that 0 ∈ U and 1 ∈ V. Since U and V are open, there exist ε₁, ε₂ > 0 such that (0, ε₁) ⊆ U and (1 - ε₂, 1) ⊆ V. Let ε = min{ε₁, ε₂}. Then (0, ε) ⊆ U and (1 - ε, 1) ⊆ V.\n\nNow, consider the closed interval [ε, 1 - ε] ⊆ [0, 1]. Since [ε, 1 - ε] is connected and p is continuous, p([ε, 1 - ε]) is a connected subset of X. Since x ∈ A and y ∈ B, p([ε, 1 - ε]) must intersect both A and B. However, this contradicts the assumption that A and B are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, there is no continuous path connecting x and y in X, and X is not path-connected."
