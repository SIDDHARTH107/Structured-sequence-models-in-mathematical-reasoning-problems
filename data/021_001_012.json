    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix of the system.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Solve the resulting triangular system using back-substitution.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix of the system.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 2 -1  4 |  2 |\n| 1 -3  2 |  7 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate the x terms from the second and third rows by using the first row.\n\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R1\n\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 0 -5  6 | -1 |\n| 0 -5  8 |  8 |\n\nNow, we'll eliminate the y terms from the third row by using the second row.\n\nR3 = R3 - R2\n\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 0 -5  6 | -1 |\n| 0  0  2 |  9 |\n\nStep 3: Solve the resulting triangular system using back-substitution.\n\nNow we have the upper triangular matrix:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 5\n-5y + 6z = -1\n2z = 9\n\nWe'll solve for z first:\n\n2z = 9\nz = 9/2\n\nNow, we'll solve for y using the second equation:\n\n-5y + 6(9/2) = -1\n-5y + 27 = -1\n-5y = -28\ny = 28/5\n\nFinally, we'll solve for x using the first equation:\n\n3x + 2(28/5) - (9/2) = 5\n3x + 56/5 - 9/2 = 5\n3x = 5 - 56/5 + 9/2\n3x = (25 - 56 + 45)/10\n3x = 14/10\nx = 7/5\n\nSo, the solution of the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 7/5\ny = 28/5\nz = 9/2"
