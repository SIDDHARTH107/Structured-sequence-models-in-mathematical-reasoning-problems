The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nC = A ∩ B = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in C is also an element in A and B:\n\n1. The element 1 is in both A and B.\n2. The element 3 is in both A and B.\n3. The element 5 is in both A and B.\n\nSince every element in C is also an element in A and B, we can conclude that C is a subset of both A and B."
