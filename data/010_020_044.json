    "message_2": "To show that F(X,α) is nonzero if and only if α satisfies certain topological conditions, we will use the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The Riemann-Hurwitz formula relates the Euler characteristics of two Riemann surfaces X and Y, and a holomorphic map f: X → Y between them. In our case, Y = S^1, which is a Riemann surface of genus 0. The formula is given by:\n\nχ(X) = dχ(Y) - ∑(e_i - 1),\n\nwhere d is the degree of the map f, χ(X) and χ(Y) are the Euler characteristics of X and Y, respectively, and e_i are the ramification indices of the map f at the ramification points.\n\nFor a compact Riemann surface of genus g, the Euler characteristic is χ(X) = 2 - 2g. Since S^1 has genus 0, its Euler characteristic is χ(S^1) = 2. Thus, the Riemann-Hurwitz formula becomes:\n\n2 - 2g = d(2) - ∑(e_i - 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the topological conditions on α for F(X,α) to be nonzero. A necessary condition is that the degree d of the map f must be nonzero, as a map of degree 0 would be constant, and thus not satisfy the prescribed boundary values given by α. Furthermore, since the ramification indices e_i are always greater than or equal to 1, we have:\n\n2 - 2g ≤ 2d - ∑(e_i - 1) < 2d.\n\nThis inequality implies that d > g - 1. Thus, for F(X,α) to be nonzero, the degree of the holomorphic map f must satisfy d > g - 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when X is a torus, i.e., g = 1. In this case, the inequality d > g - 1 becomes d > 0, which means that the degree of the holomorphic map f must be nonzero. Since α is a nonzero homology class, there exists a non-constant holomorphic map f: X → S^1 with the prescribed boundary values given by α.\n\nTo find F(X,α), we can use the Riemann-Hurwitz formula again:\n\n2 - 2(1) = d(2) - ∑(e_i - 1).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0 = 2d - ∑(e_i - 1).\n\nSince d > 0, there must be at least one ramification point with e_i > 1. However, the torus has a single complex structure, and the unit circle S^1 has a single complex structure as well. Thus, there is only one holomorphic map (up to isomorphism) from the torus to the unit circle with the prescribed boundary values given by α. Therefore, F(X,α) = 1 for the case when X is a torus and α is a nonzero homology class."
