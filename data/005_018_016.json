After 5 years, the following data was collected:\n\n- 75 patients had died,\n- 30 patients were lost to follow-up, and\n- 145 patients were still living.\n\nCalculate the overall survival rate of the patients after 5 years. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the overall survival rate, we need to determine the number of patients who survived and divide that by the total number of patients who were either alive or dead (excluding those lost to follow-up).\n\nNumber of patients who survived = Total number of patients - (Number of patients who died + Number of patients lost to follow-up)\nNumber of patients who survived = 250 - (75 + 30)\nNumber of patients who survived = 250 - 105\nNumber of patients who survived = 145\n\nNow, we need to calculate the survival rate:\n\nSurvival rate = (Number of patients who survived) / (Total number of patients - Number of patients lost to follow-up)\nSurvival rate = 145 / (250 - 30)\nSurvival rate = 145 / 220\nSurvival rate = 0.6591\n\nTo round the survival rate to two decimal places:\n\nSurvival rate = 0.66 or 66%\n\nThe overall survival rate of the patients after 5 years is 66%."
