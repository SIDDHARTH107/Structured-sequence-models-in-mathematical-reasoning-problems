    "message_1": "Suppose you have a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. If the cipher uses 16 rounds and each round involves 4 S-box substitutions, how many S-box substitution operations does the cipher perform in total?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of S-box substitution operations, we simply multiply the number of rounds by the number of S-box substitutions per round.\n\nTotal S-box substitutions = (Number of rounds) × (S-box substitutions per round)\n\nTotal S-box substitutions = 16 rounds × 4 S-box substitutions per round\n\nTotal S-box substitutions = 64\n\nSo, the cipher performs a total of 64 S-box substitution operations."
