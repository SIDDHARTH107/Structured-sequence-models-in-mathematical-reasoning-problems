    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^5 + 9x^3 - 2x + 7, we will apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, let's differentiate each term of the function with respect to x:\n\n1. The derivative of 4x^5:\nUsing the power rule, we get (5)(4)x^(5-1) = 20x^4.\n\n2. The derivative of 9x^3:\nUsing the power rule, we get (3)(9)x^(3-1) = 27x^2.\n\n3. The derivative of -2x:\nUsing the power rule, we get (1)(-2)x^(1-1) = -2x^0 = -2.\n\n4. The derivative of the constant term 7:\nThe derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nNow, let's combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 20x^4 + 27x^2 - 2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^5 + 9x^3 - 2x + 7 is f'(x) = 20x^4 + 27x^2 - 2."
