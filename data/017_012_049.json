    "message_1": "From the given topic \"Every group of order 16 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16\", a math student can be asked to solve the following problem:\n\nHow many distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 16 exist? Also, determine the structure of each of these groups and its isomorphism class - whether it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8 or the non-abelian group of order 16.",
    "message_2": "There are five distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 16. These are:\n\n1. The cyclic group C16: This group has a single generator, and its elements are powers of the generator. It is an abelian group, meaning that the group operation is commutative.\n\n2. The dihedral group D8: This group consists of the symmetries of a regular octagon, including rotations and reflections. It is a non-abelian group, meaning that the group operation is not commutative.\n\n3. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, denoted as C4 x C4: This group is formed by taking the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4. It is an abelian group.\n\n4. The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 8, denoted as C2 x C8: This group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 8. It is an abelian group.\n\n5. The non-abelian group of order 16, denoted as Q16: This group is also known as the quaternion group. It is a non-abelian group and is not isomorphic to either C16 or D8.\n\nIn summary, there are five distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 16:\n\n1. C16 (cyclic group)\n2. D8 (dihedral group)\n3. C4 x C4 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4)\n4. C2 x C8 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 8)\n5. Q16 (non-abelian group)"
