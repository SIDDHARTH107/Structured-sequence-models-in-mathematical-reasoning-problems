    "message_2": "To solve the non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 1  1 -1 |  5 |\n| 2 -1  3 |  2 |\n| 3  2  1 | 11 |\n\nNext, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1 -1 |  5  |\n| 0 -3  5 | -8  |\n| 0 -1  4 | -4  |\n\n2. Divide the second row by -3:\n\n| 1  1 -1 |  5  |\n| 0  1 -5/3 | 8/3 |\n| 0 -1  4 | -4  |\n\n3. Add the second row to the third row:\n\n| 1  1 -1  |  5   |\n| 0  1 -5/3 | 8/3 |\n| 0  0  7/3 |  4/3 |\n\n4. Divide the third row by 7/3:\n\n| 1  1 -1  |  5   |\n| 0  1 -5/3 | 8/3 |\n| 0  0  1   |  2   |\n\nNow, we perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. From the third row, we have z = 2.\n\n2. From the second row, we have y - (5/3)z = 8/3. Substituting z = 2, we get y - (10/3) = 8/3, which gives y = 6.\n\n3. From the first row, we have x + y - z = 5. Substituting y = 6 and z = 2, we get x + 6 - 2 = 5, which gives x = 1.\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is (x, y, z) = (1, 6, 2)."
