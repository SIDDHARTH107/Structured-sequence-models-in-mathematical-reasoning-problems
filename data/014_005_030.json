    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to digitally sign a document using RSA digital signature scheme. Her private key is (77, 101) and the public key is (77, 391). The message she wants to sign is \"Hello\". What is the signature value she should append with the message to sign it?",
    "message_2": "To sign the message \"Hello\" using RSA digital signature scheme, Alice needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the hash value of the message \"Hello\".\n2. Encrypt the hash value using her private key (77, 101).\n\nLet's compute the hash value using a simple hash function, such as the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the message modulo the public key's second component (391).\n\n\"Hello\" = H(72) + e(101) + l(108) + l(108) + o(111) = 500\n\nNow, we need to encrypt the hash value using Alice's private key (77, 101):\n\nSignature = (hash value)^d mod n = 500^77 mod 391\n\nUsing a modular exponentiation calculator, we find that:\n\nSignature = 208\n\nSo, Alice should append the signature value 208 with the message \"Hello\" to sign it. The signed message will be \"Hello,208\"."
