    "message_2": "This system of linear equations has multiple solutions because all three equations are linearly dependent, meaning they are multiples of each other. To see this, notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the others using the first equation:\n\nz = 7 - x - y\n\nNow we have a parametric representation of the solution set:\n\n(x, y, 7 - x - y)\n\nThis means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, and they can be represented by any values of x and y that satisfy the equation z = 7 - x - y."
