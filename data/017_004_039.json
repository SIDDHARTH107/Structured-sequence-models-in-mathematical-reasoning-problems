    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 25, we can use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. In this case, the order of the group is 25, which is a prime power (5^2).\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (denoted as n_5) must divide the order of the group (25) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. However, since 25 is not congruent to 1 modulo 5, the only possibility is n_5 = 1. This means there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it is normal in the group.\n\nSince the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal and has order 25, the group itself must be a p-group (a group of prime power order). For p-groups, the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n is determined by the number of partitions of n. In this case, the number of partitions of 2 (the exponent of the prime 5 in the order of the group) is 2: {2} and {1, 1}.\n\nThese partitions correspond to the following non-isomorphic groups of order 25:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 25, denoted as C_25 or Z_25.\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted as C_5 Ã— C_5.\n\nThus, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 25."
