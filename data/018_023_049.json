    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) × A and A × (A Δ B).\n\n(A Δ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nA × (A Δ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nComparing the two resulting sets, we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A Δ B) × A ≠ A × (A Δ B)\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to Cartesian product."
