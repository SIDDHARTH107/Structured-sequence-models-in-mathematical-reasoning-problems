    "message_2": "To perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the given data, we first need to standardize the data, calculate the covariance matrix, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and finally compute the proportion of total variance explained by the first principal component.\n\n1. Standardize the data:\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation for each variable (income and age).\n\nMean of income (µ_income) = (30 + 60 + 50 + 70 + 45 + 66 + 35) / 7 = 50.57\nMean of age (µ_age) = (45 + 18 + 21 + 29 + 35 + 22 + 39) / 7 = 29.86\n\nStandard deviation of income (σ_income) = sqrt((sum of squared differences from the mean) / 7) = sqrt(546.86) = 23.39\nStandard deviation of age (σ_age) = sqrt((sum of squared differences from the mean) / 7) = sqrt(224.29) = 14.98\n\nNow, we standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable:\n\nStandardized data:\n[(30-50.57)/23.39, (45-29.86)/14.98] = [-0.88, 1.01]\n[(60-50.57)/23.39, (18-29.86)/14.98] = [0.40, -0.79]\n[(50-50.57)/23.39, (21-29.86)/14.98] = [-0.02, -0.59]\n[(70-50.57)/23.39, (29-29.86)/14.98] = [0.83, -0.06]\n[(45-50.57)/23.39, (35-29.86)/14.98] = [-0.24, 0.34]\n[(66-50.57)/23.39, (22-29.86)/14.98] = [0.66, -0.53]\n[(35-50.57)/23.39, (39-29.86)/14.98] = [-0.66, 0.61]\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix:\n\nUsing the standardized data, we can calculate the covariance matrix:\n\nCovariance matrix:\n[[ 1.00, -0.68]\n [-0.68,  1.00]]\n\n3. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix:\n\nEigenvalues: λ1 = 1.68, λ2 = 0.32\nEigenvectors: v1 = [0.71, -0.71], v2 = [0.71, 0.71]\n\n4. Compute the proportion of total variance explained by the first principal component:\n\nThe proportion of total variance explained by the first principal component is given by the ratio of the first eigenvalue to the sum of all eigenvalues:\n\nProportion = λ1 / (λ1 + λ2) = 1.68 / (1.68 + 0.32) = 1.68 / 2 = 0.84\n\nThus, the first principal component explains 84% of the total variance in the data."
