    "message_1": "At a comedy show, there are 8 performers. Each performer has a 60% chance of making the audience laugh. What is the probability that at least 5 performers will make the audience laugh?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 performers will make the audience laugh, we need to consider the probabilities of 5, 6, 7, and 8 performers making the audience laugh and then sum those probabilities.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (making the audience laugh) out of n trials (performers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n- p is the probability of success (60% or 0.6)\n- n is the number of trials (8 performers)\n- k is the number of successes (5, 6, 7, or 8)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of exactly 5 performers making the audience laugh:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(8, 5) * 0.6^5 * 0.4^3\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5! * 3!) = 56\nP(X = 5) = 56 * 0.6^5 * 0.4^3 ≈ 0.27869184\n\nNow, let's find the probability of exactly 6 performers making the audience laugh:\n\nP(X = 6) = C(8, 6) * 0.6^6 * 0.4^2\n\nC(8, 6) = 8! / (6! * 2!) = 28\nP(X = 6) = 28 * 0.6^6 * 0.4^2 ≈ 0.16515072\n\nNext, let's find the probability of exactly 7 performers making the audience laugh:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(8, 7) * 0.6^7 * 0.4^1\n\nC(8, 7) = 8! / (7! * 1!) = 8\nP(X = 7) = 8 * 0.6^7 * 0.4^1 ≈ 0.041472\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of all 8 performers making the audience laugh:\n\nP(X = 8) = C(8, 8) * 0.6^8 * 0.4^0\n\nC(8, 8) = 8! / (8! * 0!) = 1\nP(X = 8) = 1 * 0.6^8 * 1 ≈ 0.01679616\n\nNow, we sum the probabilities of 5, 6, 7, and 8 performers making the audience laugh:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8)\nP(X ≥ 5) ≈ 0.27869184 + 0.16515072 + 0.041472 + 0.01679616\nP(X ≥ 5) ≈ 0.50211072\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 performers will make the audience laugh is approximately 0.5021 or 50.21%."
