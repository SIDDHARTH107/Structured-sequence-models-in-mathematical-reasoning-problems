Determine the number of possible abelian groups: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we can find that there are 5 possible abelian groups of order 48.\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups: To do this, we can use the Sylow theorems. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide the order of the group and satisfy certain conditions. For n_2, we have the possibilities 1, 3, and 4. For n_3, we have the possibilities 1 and 4. By analyzing these possibilities and using the Sylow theorems, we can find that there are 5 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn total, there are 5 abelian groups + 5 non-abelian groups = 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
