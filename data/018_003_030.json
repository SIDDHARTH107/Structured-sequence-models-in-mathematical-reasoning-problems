    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B, we need to show that every element in A and B is also an element in A ∪ B.\n\nRecall the definition of the union of two sets: A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x from set A. By definition of the union, x ∈ A or x ∈ B. Since x is an element of A, it is true that x ∈ A ∪ B. Therefore, every element in A is also an element in A ∪ B, which means A ⊆ A ∪ B.\n\nSimilarly, let's take an arbitrary element y from set B. By definition of the union, y ∈ A or y ∈ B. Since y is an element of B, it is true that y ∈ A ∪ B. Therefore, every element in B is also an element in A ∪ B, which means B ⊆ A ∪ B.\n\nSince A ⊆ A ∪ B and B ⊆ A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B."
