    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every node (vertex) is visited exactly once.\n\nBased on the graph provided in the link, one Hamiltonian cycle can be represented as follows:\n\n1 → 2 → 3 → 7 → 5 → 4 → 6 → 1\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, satisfying the conditions of a Hamiltonian cycle."
