    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature, we need to compute the Gaussian curvature first. The Gaussian curvature K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nwhere E, F, G are coefficients of the first fundamental form, and L, M, N are coefficients of the second fundamental form.\n\nFrom the given first fundamental form, we have:\n\nds^2 = (1 + u^2)du^2 + dv^2\n\nSo, E = 1 + u^2, F = 0, and G = 1.\n\nFrom the given second fundamental form, we have:\n\nL = 0, M = u, and N = -u.\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (u, v) = (1, 0), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 1^2 = 2, F = 0, G = 1, L = 0, M = 1, and N = -1.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for K, we get:\n\nK = ((0 * -1) - (1^2)) / ((2 * 1) - (0^2))\nK = (-1) / 2\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature K at the point (u, v) = (1, 0) is -1/2.\n\nNow, to find the sectional curvature, we need to compute the normalized tangent vectors of the surface. Since the surface is parameterized by u and v, we can use the partial derivatives with respect to u and v as tangent vectors.\n\nLet X_u = ∂X/∂u and X_v = ∂X/∂v be tangent vectors. Since F = 0, the tangent vectors are orthogonal, and we can compute their magnitudes:\n\n||X_u||^2 = E = 2\n||X_v||^2 = G = 1\n\nNow, we can normalize the tangent vectors:\n\nX_u_normalized = X_u / sqrt(2)\nX_v_normalized = X_v\n\nFinally, the sectional curvature is given by the product of the Gaussian curvature K and the squared magnitudes of the normalized tangent vectors:\n\nSectional curvature = K * ||X_u_normalized||^2 * ||X_v_normalized||^2\nSectional curvature = (-1/2) * (1/2) * 1\nSectional curvature = -1/4\n\nSo, the sectional curvature at the point (u, v) = (1, 0) is -1/4."
