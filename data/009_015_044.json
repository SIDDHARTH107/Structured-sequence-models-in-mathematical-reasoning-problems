    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\nSuppose a sample initially contains 600 grams of a radioactive substance that decays over time. The half-life of the substance is 25 years. Write an equation for the amount of the substance remaining after t years, and find the amount of the substance remaining after 100 years.",
    "message_2": "To model the decay of a radioactive substance, we can use the equation:\n\nA(t) = A₀ * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\n- A(t) is the amount of the substance remaining after t years\n- A₀ is the initial amount of the substance (600 grams in this case)\n- t is the time in years\n- T is the half-life of the substance (25 years in this case)\n\nSo the equation for the amount of the substance remaining after t years is:\n\nA(t) = 600 * (1/2)^(t/25)\n\nNow, we want to find the amount of the substance remaining after 100 years. We can plug t = 100 into the equation:\n\nA(100) = 600 * (1/2)^(100/25)\n\nA(100) = 600 * (1/2)^4\n\nA(100) = 600 * (1/16)\n\nA(100) = 37.5 grams\n\nSo, after 100 years, there will be 37.5 grams of the radioactive substance remaining."
