    "message_1": "A company needs to transport 7500 boxes of products from its warehouse to a distribution center. There are two transportation options available: Truck A can carry 150 boxes at a cost of $300 per trip, while Truck B can carry 250 boxes at a cost of $400 per trip. How many trips of each truck should the company use to minimize the cost of transportation?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of trips made by Truck A and y be the number of trips made by Truck B. We need to minimize the total cost, which can be represented by the equation:\n\nCost = 300x + 400y\n\nWe also know that the total number of boxes transported by both trucks must be equal to 7500:\n\n150x + 250y = 7500\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can first solve the second equation for y:\n\n250y = 7500 - 150x\ny = (7500 - 150x) / 250\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\nCost = 300x + 400((7500 - 150x) / 250)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nCost = 300x + 400(30 - 0.6x)\nCost = 300x + 12000 - 240x\nCost = 60x + 12000\n\nNow we need to find the minimum cost. To do this, we can analyze the equation and find the minimum value for x (number of trips by Truck A) that satisfies the constraints.\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative integers (you cannot have a negative or fractional number of trips), we can start by checking the smallest possible value for x:\n\nIf x = 0, then y = (7500 - 150(0)) / 250 = 30.\n\nThis means that if Truck A makes 0 trips, Truck B must make 30 trips. The cost in this case would be:\n\nCost = 60(0) + 12000 = 12000\n\nNow let's check the next possible value for x:\n\nIf x = 1, then y = (7500 - 150(1)) / 250 = 29.4.\n\nHowever, y must be an integer, so this is not a valid solution. We can continue checking values for x until we find another valid solution:\n\nIf x = 2, then y = (7500 - 150(2)) / 250 = 28.8 (not an integer)\nIf x = 3, then y = (7500 - 150(3)) / 250 = 28.2 (not an integer)\nIf x = 4, then y = (7500 - 150(4)) / 250 = 27.6 (not an integer)\nIf x = 5, then y = (7500 - 150(5)) / 250 = 27 (integer)\n\nSo if Truck A makes 5 trips, Truck B must make 27 trips. The cost in this case would be:\n\nCost = 60(5) + 12000 = 12300\n\nComparing the two valid solutions we found (x = 0, y = 30 and x = 5, y = 27), the minimum cost is achieved when Truck A makes 0 trips and Truck B makes 30 trips, with a total cost of $12,000."
