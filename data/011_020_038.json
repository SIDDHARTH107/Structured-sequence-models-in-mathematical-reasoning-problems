There are 3 available routes to choose from, each with different capacities as shown below:\n\nRoute 1: Capacity of 350 units\nRoute 2: Capacity of 450 units\nRoute 3: Capacity of 600 units\n\nWhat is the minimum number of trips the company needs to make in order to transport all 1000 units of products?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of trips, the company should use the routes with the highest capacities first. \n\nFirst, use Route 3 with a capacity of 600 units. After this trip, 400 units remain to be transported (1000 - 600 = 400).\n\nNext, use Route 2 with a capacity of 450 units. This will be enough to transport the remaining 400 units.\n\nSo, the minimum number of trips the company needs to make is 2."
