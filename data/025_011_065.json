    "message_1": "Let's say we have an Abelian variety $A$ defined over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ with dimension $2$, and a point $P \\in A(\\mathbb{Q})$ of finite order $n$. Suppose further that $n = 13$ and the Tate pairing $\\langle \\ , \\ \\rangle_{13}$ is non-degenerate on the subgroup $\\langle P \\rangle$. Determine the order of the group $A(\\mathbb{Q})/\\langle P \\rangle$ (i.e., the order of the quotient group).",
    "message_2": "Since $A$ is an Abelian variety of dimension $2$, we know that the Mordell-Weil theorem applies, which states that the group of rational points $A(\\mathbb{Q})$ is a finitely generated abelian group. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$A(\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T$\n\nwhere $r$ is the rank of $A(\\mathbb{Q})$, and $T$ is the torsion subgroup of $A(\\mathbb{Q})$. \n\nGiven that $P \\in A(\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $13$, we know that $P$ is a torsion point, and thus belongs to the torsion subgroup $T$. Since the Tate pairing $\\langle \\ , \\ \\rangle_{13}$ is non-degenerate on the subgroup $\\langle P \\rangle$, it follows that the order of the group $A(\\mathbb{Q})[13]$ (the $13$-torsion points) is $13^2 = 169$.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group $A(\\mathbb{Q})/\\langle P \\rangle$. Since $P$ is a torsion point of order $13$, we have:\n\n$A(\\mathbb{Q})/\\langle P \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T'$\n\nwhere $T'$ is the torsion subgroup of $A(\\mathbb{Q})$ modulo the subgroup $\\langle P \\rangle$. Note that $T'$ contains all the $13$-torsion points of $A(\\mathbb{Q})$ except for $P$ itself. Therefore, the order of $T'$ is $169 - 13 = 156$.\n\nFinally, the order of the quotient group $A(\\mathbb{Q})/\\langle P \\rangle$ is the product of the orders of its components:\n\n$|A(\\mathbb{Q})/\\langle P \\rangle| = | \\mathbb{Z}^r| \\cdot |T'| = 156$\n\nsince the order of a free abelian group of rank $r$ is infinite, but the order of the quotient group is finite, we must have $r=0$. Thus, the order of the group $A(\\mathbb{Q})/\\langle P \\rangle$ is $156$."
