    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces a product that has a demand of 100 units per week. The production process is subject to uncertainty, and the actual demand can vary between 90 and 110 units per week with equal probability. The plant can adjust its production by choosing the amount to produce each week, but in doing so, it incurs a cost of $10 per unit produced. What is the optimal production plan that minimizes the expected cost of production over the next 10 weeks, assuming that the demand is independent and identically distributed every week?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production plan, we need to minimize the expected cost of production over the next 10 weeks. Let's denote the production amount as x units per week. \n\nThe cost of production per week is $10x. Since the demand can vary between 90 and 110 units per week with equal probability, we can calculate the expected cost of overproduction and underproduction.\n\n1. Overproduction: If the plant produces more than the demand, the excess units will incur a cost. The probability of overproduction is (x - 90)/20 for x > 90 and 0 for x ≤ 90. The expected cost of overproduction per week is:\n\nE(overproduction) = $10 * (x - 90) * (x - 90)/20 for x > 90\nE(overproduction) = 0 for x ≤ 90\n\n2. Underproduction: If the plant produces less than the demand, it will lose potential revenue. The probability of underproduction is (110 - x)/20 for x < 110 and 0 for x ≥ 110. The expected cost of underproduction per week is:\n\nE(underproduction) = $10 * (110 - x) * (110 - x)/20 for x < 110\nE(underproduction) = 0 for x ≥ 110\n\nThe total expected cost per week is the sum of the cost of production, overproduction, and underproduction:\n\nE(total) = $10x + E(overproduction) + E(underproduction)\n\nTo minimize the expected cost, we can take the derivative of E(total) with respect to x and set it to zero:\n\ndE(total)/dx = 10 + dE(overproduction)/dx - dE(underproduction)/dx = 0\n\nFor x > 90 and x < 110, we have:\n\ndE(overproduction)/dx = $10 * (x - 90)/20\ndE(underproduction)/dx = -$10 * (110 - x)/20\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n10 + $10 * (x - 90)/20 - $10 * (110 - x)/20 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 100\n\nSo, the optimal production plan is to produce 100 units per week, which is equal to the average demand. This minimizes the expected cost of production over the next 10 weeks."
