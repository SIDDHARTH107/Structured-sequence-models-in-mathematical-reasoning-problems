    "message_2": "The given surface is a sphere with radius 2 centered at the origin. The equation of the surface is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4. To find the mean curvature at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)), we first need to find the principal curvatures.\n\nLet's find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. The gradient of the surface is given by:\n\n∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)), the gradient is:\n\n∇f = (2, 2, 2sqrt(2))\n\nThe normal vector N at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)) is given by:\n\nN = ∇f / ||∇f|| = (2, 2, 2sqrt(2)) / sqrt(12 + 8) = (1/3, 1/3, 2sqrt(2)/3)\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form. The Hessian matrix of the surface is given by:\n\nH = | 2  0  0 |\n    | 0  2  0 |\n    | 0  0  2 |\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the projection of the Hessian matrix onto the tangent plane:\n\nII = -H(N) = -(-2/3, -2/3, -4/3) = (2/3, 2/3, 4/3)\n\nNow, let's find the principal curvatures. The principal curvatures k1 and k2 are the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form. Since the second fundamental form is diagonal, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal elements:\n\nk1 = 2/3\nk2 = 2/3\n\nFinally, the mean curvature H is given by the average of the principal curvatures:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2 = (2/3 + 2/3) / 2 = 2/3\n\nSo, the mean curvature at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)) is 2/3."
