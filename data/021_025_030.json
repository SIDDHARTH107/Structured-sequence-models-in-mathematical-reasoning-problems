    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global optimum of a given function. To apply the WOA, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales (search agents) randomly within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale.\n3. Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations).\n\nSince the WOA is a stochastic algorithm, it is not possible to provide an exact solution. However, we can run the algorithm and provide an approximate solution. Here's a Python implementation of the WOA to find the maximum value of f(x) and the corresponding x value:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 2 * x**2 - x**3 - 2 * np.sin(x)\n\ndef init_population(size, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    return np.random.uniform(lower_bound, upper_bound, size)\n\ndef whale_optimization_algorithm(f, lower_bound, upper_bound, n_whales=30, max_iter=1000):\n    whales = init_population(n_whales, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    best_whale = max(whales, key=f)\n    best_fitness = f(best_whale)\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        a = 2 * np.random.rand() - 1\n        A = 2 * a * np.random.rand(n_whales) - a\n        C = 2 * np.random.rand(n_whales)\n        l = (np.random.rand(n_whales) - 0.5) * 2\n        p = np.random.rand()\n\n        for i, whale in enumerate(whales):\n            if p < 0.5:\n                if abs(A[i]) < 1:\n                    whales[i] = best_whale - A[i] * abs(best_whale - whale)\n                else:\n                    random_whale = whales[np.random.randint(n_whales)]\n                    whales[i] = random_whale - A[i] * abs(random_whale - whale)\n            else:\n                whales[i] = best_whale + l[i] * abs(best_whale - whale)\n\n            whales[i] = np.clip(whales[i], lower_bound, upper_bound)\n            fitness = f(whales[i])\n\n            if fitness > best_fitness:\n                best_fitness = fitness\n                best_whale = whales[i]\n\n    return best_whale, best_fitness\n\nbest_x, max_value = whale_optimization_algorithm(f, -10, 10)\nprint(f\"Approximate maximum value of f(x): {max_value}\")\nprint(f\"Approximate value of x that maximizes f(x): {best_x}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you an approximate solution for the maximum value of f(x) and the corresponding x value. Note that the results may vary slightly each time you run the algorithm due to its stochastic nature."
