The following table shows the yield (in kg) of the crop for each fertilizer type:\n\n| Fertilizer type | Yield (kg) |\n| --- | --- |\n| A | 65, 70, 75, 65, 70 |\n| B | 72, 78, 75, 70, 68 |\n| C | 80, 82, 78, 76, 72 |\n\nIs there sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean yields of the three fertilizer types are different? Use a significance level of α = 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean yields of the three fertilizer types are different, we will perform a one-way ANOVA test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the mean yields among the three fertilizer types, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a difference in the mean yields among the three fertilizer types.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean yield for each fertilizer type:\n\nA: (65 + 70 + 75 + 65 + 70) / 5 = 69\nB: (72 + 78 + 75 + 70 + 68) / 5 = 72.6\nC: (80 + 82 + 78 + 76 + 72) / 5 = 77.6\n\nNext, we need to calculate the overall mean yield:\n\nTotal yield: (69 * 5) + (72.6 * 5) + (77.6 * 5) = 1095\nTotal number of observations: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15\nOverall mean yield: 1095 / 15 = 73\n\nNow, we will calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and the total sum of squares (SST):\n\nSSB = Σ(n_i * (mean_i - overall_mean)^2)\nSSB = (5 * (69 - 73)^2) + (5 * (72.6 - 73)^2) + (5 * (77.6 - 73)^2) = 408.2\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(y_ij - mean_i)^2\nFor A: (65-69)^2 + (70-69)^2 + (75-69)^2 + (65-69)^2 + (70-69)^2 = 50\nFor B: (72-72.6)^2 + (78-72.6)^2 + (75-72.6)^2 + (70-72.6)^2 + (68-72.6)^2 = 54.8\nFor C: (80-77.6)^2 + (82-77.6)^2 + (78-77.6)^2 + (76-77.6)^2 + (72-77.6)^2 = 62.8\nSSW = 50 + 54.8 + 62.8 = 167.6\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 408.2 + 167.6 = 575.8\n\nNow, we will calculate the mean square between groups (MSB), mean square within groups (MSW), and the F-statistic:\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1) = 408.2 / (3 - 1) = 204.1\nMSW = SSW / (N - k) = 167.6 / (15 - 3) = 20.95\n\nF-statistic = MSB / MSW = 204.1 / 20.95 = 9.74\n\nNow, we will compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table. The degrees of freedom for the numerator (df1) is k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2, and the degrees of freedom for the denominator (df2) is N - k = 15 - 3 = 12. Using a significance level of α = 0.05, we find the critical value from the F-distribution table to be 3.89.\n\nSince the F-statistic (9.74) is greater than the critical value (3.89), we reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean yields of the three fertilizer types are different at a significance level of α = 0.05."
