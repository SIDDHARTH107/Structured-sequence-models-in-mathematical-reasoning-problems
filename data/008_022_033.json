    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the LU decomposition method, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n5x + 6y + 2z = 23\n3x + 2y + z = 10\nx + y + z = 6\n\nThe coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix B are:\n\nA = | 5  6  2 |\n    | 3  2  1 |\n    | 1  1  1 |\n\nB = | 23 |\n    | 10 |\n    |  6 |\n\nNow, we perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\n1. L[1,1] = A[1,1] = 5\n   U[1,1] = 1\n\n2. U[1,2] = A[1,2] / L[1,1] = 6 / 5\n   U[1,3] = A[1,3] / L[1,1] = 2 / 5\n\n3. L[2,1] = A[2,1] = 3\n   L[3,1] = A[3,1] = 1\n\n4. L[2,2] = A[2,2] - L[2,1] * U[1,2] = 2 - 3 * (6 / 5) = -2/5\n   U[2,2] = 1\n\n5. U[2,3] = (A[2,3] - L[2,1] * U[1,3]) / L[2,2] = (1 - 3 * (2 / 5)) / (-2/5) = 1/2\n\n6. L[3,2] = (A[3,2] - L[3,1] * U[1,2]) / U[2,2] = (1 - 1 * (6 / 5)) / 1 = -1/5\n\n7. L[3,3] = A[3,3] - L[3,1] * U[1,3] - L[3,2] * U[2,3] = 1 - 1 * (2 / 5) - (-1/5) * (1/2) = 3/5\n   U[3,3] = 1\n\nNow, we have the L and U matrices:\n\nL = |  5    0    0  |\n    |  3  -2/5   0  |\n    |  1  -1/5  3/5 |\n\nU = |  1   6/5  2/5  |\n    |  0    1   1/2  |\n    |  0    0    1  |\n\nNext, we solve the equation L * Y = B for Y:\n\n1. Y[1] = B[1] / L[1,1] = 23 / 5\n2. Y[2] = (B[2] - L[2,1] * Y[1]) / L[2,2] = (10 - 3 * (23 / 5)) / (-2/5) = -3\n3. Y[3] = (B[3] - L[3,1] * Y[1] - L[3,2] * Y[2]) / L[3,3] = (6 - 1 * (23 / 5) - (-1/5) * (-3)) / (3/5) = 1\n\nSo, Y = | 23/5 |\n         |  -3  |\n         |   1  |\n\nFinally, we solve the equation U * X = Y for X:\n\n1. X[3] = Y[3] / U[3,3] = 1 / 1 = 1\n2. X[2] = (Y[2] - U[2,3] * X[3]) / U[2,2] = (-3 - 1/2 * 1) / 1 = -7/2\n3. X[1] = (Y[1] - U[1,2] * X[2] - U[1,3] * X[3]) / U[1,1] = (23/5 - 6/5 * (-7/2) - 2/5 * 1) / 1 = 2\n\nSo, the solution of the system is:\n\nX = |  2  |\n    | -7/2|\n    |  1  |"
