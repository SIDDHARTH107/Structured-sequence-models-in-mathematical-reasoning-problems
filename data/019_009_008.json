    "message_2": "To prove that (A or B) and (not A or C) implies (B or C) using intuitionistic logic, we will use the rules of natural deduction. Here's the proof:\n\n1. (A or B) and (not A or C) [Assumption]\n2. A or B [Conjunction elimination from 1]\n3. not A or C [Conjunction elimination from 1]\n4. not (not B and not C) [Assumption for reductio ad absurdum]\n5. not B and not C [Double negation elimination from 4]\n6. not B [Conjunction elimination from 5]\n7. not C [Conjunction elimination from 5]\n\nNow, we will consider the two cases of the disjunction A or B:\n\nCase 1: A\n8. not A [Assumption for reductio ad absurdum]\n9. A and not A [Conjunction introduction from 7 and 8]\n10. not A -> (A and not A) [Implication introduction from 9]\n11. A -> (A and not A) [Implication introduction from 10]\n\nCase 2: B\n12. B [Assumption]\n13. B or C [Disjunction introduction from 12]\n14. not (B or C) [Assumption for reductio ad absurdum]\n15. B and not (B or C) [Conjunction introduction from 12 and 14]\n16. B -> (B and not (B or C)) [Implication introduction from 15]\n\nNow, we can combine the two cases:\n17. (A or B) -> ((A -> (A and not A)) and (B -> (B and not (B or C)))) [Disjunction elimination from 2, 11, and 16]\n18. (A -> (A and not A)) and (B -> (B and not (B or C))) [Implication elimination from 17 and 2]\n19. A -> (A and not A) [Conjunction elimination from 18]\n20. B -> (B and not (B or C)) [Conjunction elimination from 18]\n\nNow, we can use the second disjunction not A or C:\n\nCase 1: not A\n21. not A [Assumption]\n22. A and not A [Implication elimination from 19 and 21]\n23. not A -> (A and not A) [Implication introduction from 22]\n\nCase 2: C\n24. C [Assumption]\n25. B or C [Disjunction introduction from 24]\n26. not (B or C) [Assumption for reductio ad absurdum]\n27. C and not (B or C) [Conjunction introduction from 24 and 26]\n28. C -> (C and not (B or C)) [Implication introduction from 27]\n\nNow, we can combine the two cases:\n29. (not A or C) -> ((not A -> (A and not A)) and (C -> (C and not (B or C)))) [Disjunction elimination from 3, 23, and 28]\n30. (not A -> (A and not A)) and (C -> (C and not (B or C))) [Implication elimination from 29 and 3]\n31. not A -> (A and not A) [Conjunction elimination from 30]\n32. C -> (C and not (B or C)) [Conjunction elimination from 30]\n\nNow, we can use the assumption not (not B and not C):\n\n33. not B and not C [Assumption]\n34. not B [Conjunction elimination from 33]\n35. not C [Conjunction elimination from 33]\n36. B and not (B or C) [Implication elimination from 20 and 34]\n37. C and not (B or C) [Implication elimination from 32 and 35]\n\nNow, we have a contradiction since we have both B and not (B or C) and C and not (B or C). This means that our assumption not (not B and not C) leads to a contradiction, so we can conclude that:\n\n38. not (not (not B and not C)) [Reductio ad absurdum from 4, 36, and 37]\n39. B or C [Double negation elimination from 38]\n\nSo, we have proven that (A or B) and (not A or C) implies (B or C) using intuitionistic logic."
