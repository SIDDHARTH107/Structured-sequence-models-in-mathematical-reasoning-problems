    "message_1": "Suppose you have a set of 5 beads, each of a different color, and you want to make a necklace using all of them. In how many different ways can you create the necklace (assuming that two necklaces are equivalent if one can be rotated to look like the other)? Apply Polya's enumeration theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To apply Polya's enumeration theorem, we need to find the cycle index polynomial of the group acting on the set of beads. In this case, the group is the cyclic group C_5, which represents the rotations of the necklace.\n\nThe cycle index polynomial of C_5 is given by:\n\nP_C5 = (1/5) * (p_1^5 + 4*p_5)\n\nNow, we want to find the number of distinct colorings of the necklace. To do this, we substitute p_i = k for i = 1, 2, ..., 5, where k is the number of colors (in this case, k = 5).\n\nP_C5(5) = (1/5) * (5^5 + 4*5) = (1/5) * (3125 + 20) = 629\n\nHowever, this counts reflections as distinct necklaces, so we need to account for that. The dihedral group D_5 also acts on the set of beads, and its cycle index polynomial is given by:\n\nP_D5 = (1/10) * (p_1^5 + 4*p_5 + 5*p_1*p_2^2)\n\nSubstituting p_i = 5 for i = 1, 2, ..., 5, we get:\n\nP_D5(5) = (1/10) * (5^5 + 4*5 + 5*5^3) = (1/10) * (3125 + 20 + 6250) = 639.5\n\nNow, we take the average of the values obtained from the cycle index polynomials of C_5 and D_5 to account for reflections:\n\n(629 + 639.5) / 2 = 634.25\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer:\n\n634\n\nSo, there are 634 different ways to create the necklace using all 5 beads of different colors, considering rotations and reflections."
