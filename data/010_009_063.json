    "message_2": "To divide the triangle into four triangles with equal area, we can find three points within the triangle such that they form a smaller triangle with the same orientation as the original triangle. Let's denote these points as A, B, and C.\n\nLet A be the midpoint of the base, which is at coordinate (2, 0).\nLet B be the point on the left side of the triangle such that the area of triangle B(0,0)(2,0) is 1/4 of the total area.\nLet C be the point on the right side of the triangle such that the area of triangle C(4,0)(2,0) is 1/4 of the total area.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the original triangle using the coordinates of its vertices:\n\nArea = 1/2 * base * height\nArea = 1/2 * 4 * 2\nArea = 4\n\nNow, we want to divide this area into four equal parts, so each smaller triangle should have an area of 1.\n\nNext, let's find the coordinates of point B. Since the area of triangle B(0,0)(2,0) is 1, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\n1 = 1/2 * base * height\n1 = 1/2 * 2 * height\nheight = 1\n\nSo, point B has coordinates (0, 1).\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of point C. Since the area of triangle C(4,0)(2,0) is also 1, we can use the same formula:\n\n1 = 1/2 * base * height\n1 = 1/2 * 2 * height\nheight = 1\n\nSo, point C has coordinates (4, 1).\n\nNow we have triangulated the original triangle into four smaller triangles with equal area:\n\n1. Triangle with vertices (0, 0), (2, 0), and (0, 1)\n2. Triangle with vertices (2, 0), (4, 0), and (4, 1)\n3. Triangle with vertices (0, 1), (2, 0), and (4, 1)\n4. Triangle with vertices (0, 2), (0, 1), and (4, 1)\n\nEach of these triangles has an area of 1, which is 1/4 of the original triangle's area."
