    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The SDE is given by:\n\ndX = 2X dt + 3X dW\n\nThis is a linear SDE with multiplicative noise. We can rewrite it in the form of an integrating factor:\n\ndX/X = 2 dt + 3 dW\n\nNow, integrate both sides over the interval [0, t]:\n\n∫(dX/X) = ∫(2 dt + 3 dW) from 0 to t\n\nTaking the integral, we get:\n\nln(X(t)/X(0)) = 2t + 3W(t)\n\nSince X(0) = 1, we have:\n\nln(X(t)) = 2t + 3W(t)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides:\n\nX(t) = exp(2t + 3W(t))\n\nWe are interested in the probability that X(t) exceeds 4 for some 0 <= t <= 1. Let Y(t) = ln(X(t)/4). Then, we want to find the probability that Y(t) > 0 for some 0 <= t <= 1.\n\nY(t) = ln(X(t)/4) = ln(exp(2t + 3W(t))/4) = 2t + 3W(t) - ln(4)\n\nNow, let Z(t) = W(t) - (2/3)t. Then, Z(t) is also a Wiener process, and Y(t) = 3Z(t) + (2/3)t - ln(4). We want to find the probability that Y(t) > 0 for some 0 <= t <= 1.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the probability that the process Z(t) crosses the level (ln(4) - (2/3)t)/3 for some 0 <= t <= 1. This is a first-passage time problem for a Wiener process.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no closed-form solution for the first-passage time probability of a Wiener process. However, we can approximate the probability using numerical methods, such as Monte Carlo simulations or solving the associated partial differential equation (Fokker-Planck equation) numerically.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no simple analytical solution to the problem, but the probability can be approximated using numerical methods."
