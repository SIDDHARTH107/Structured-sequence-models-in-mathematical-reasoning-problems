    "message_1": "Suppose an event occurs randomly at an average rate of 5 times per hour. What is the probability that the event occurs exactly 3 times within the next 45 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a fixed average rate of occurrence.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events in the given interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of occurrence (in this case, 5 events per hour)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 3 events)\n\nSince we are looking for the probability of the event occurring exactly 3 times within the next 45 minutes, we first need to adjust the average rate of occurrence (λ) to match the 45-minute interval. There are 0.75 hours in 45 minutes (45/60), so the average rate of occurrence for 45 minutes is:\n\nλ = 5 events per hour * 0.75 hours = 3.75 events\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Poisson probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-3.75) * 3.75^3) / 3!\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ (0.023517746 * 52.734375) / 6\nP(X = 3) ≈ 1.239694 / 6\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.2066157\n\nSo, the probability that the event occurs exactly 3 times within the next 45 minutes is approximately 20.66%."
