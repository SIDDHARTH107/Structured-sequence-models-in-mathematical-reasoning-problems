    "message_1": "A rectangular metal plate with sides of 5 cm and 3 cm is heated uniformly to a temperature of 50°C. Find the temperature distribution after 5 minutes if the top edge is held at 60°C and the other edges cool to 30°C. Given that the thermal diffusivity of the plate is 0.03 cm²/s. Use partial differential equations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature at point (x, y) and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nWe are given the initial condition T(x, y, 0) = 50°C, and the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, y, t) = T(5, y, t) = T(x, 0, t) = 30°C (the sides and bottom edge)\nT(x, 3, t) = 60°C (the top edge)\n\nTo solve the heat equation with these boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as the product of three functions, T(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)∂T/∂t = α(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by αXYT, we obtain:\n\n(1/αT)∂T/∂t = (X''/X) + (Y''/Y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/αT)∂T/∂t = -λ\n(X''/X) + (Y''/Y) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX'' + λX = 0\nY'' - (λ/α)Y = 0\n\nSolving these equations with the given boundary conditions, we obtain the following eigenvalue problem:\n\nX(0) = X(5) = 0\nY(0) = Y(3) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues λ_n and eigenfunctions X_n(x) and Y_n(y) can be found as:\n\nλ_n = (nπ/5)², X_n(x) = sin(nπx/5), Y_n(y) = cosh(nπy/5)\n\nNow we can write the general solution as a sum of these eigenfunctions:\n\nT(x, y, t) = ∑[A_n sin(nπx/5) cosh(nπy/5) e^(-α(λ_n)t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition T(x, y, 0) = 50°C:\n\n50 = ∑[A_n sin(nπx/5) cosh(nπy/5)]\n\nUsing Fourier series, we can find the coefficients A_n:\n\nA_n = (2/5) ∫[50 sin(nπx/5) dx] from 0 to 5\n\nSolving this integral, we get:\n\nA_n = (200/π²n²) (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow we have the temperature distribution T(x, y, t):\n\nT(x, y, t) = ∑[(200/π²n²) (1 - (-1)^n) sin(nπx/5) cosh(nπy/5) e^(-α(λ_n)t)]\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution after 5 minutes (300 seconds):\n\nT(x, y, 300) = ∑[(200/π²n²) (1 - (-1)^n) sin(nπx/5) cosh(nπy/5) e^(-0.03(λ_n)300)]\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution T(x, y, 300) for the rectangular metal plate after 5 minutes."
