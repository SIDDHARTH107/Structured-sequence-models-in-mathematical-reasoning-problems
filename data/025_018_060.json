    "message_1": "A math student wants to study Mori theory and its applications in Algebraic Geometry. Here's a numerical problem they can solve:\n\nConsider the polynomial equation f(x,y,z) = x^3 + 2x^2y - 3xy^2 + 4y^3 - 6xz^2 - 12yz^2 - 7z^3 = 0. Determine the degree of f as a polynomial in x, and find the equation of the intersection of the curve given by f(x,y,z) = 0 with the plane z = 0.",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of f as a polynomial in x, we look at the highest power of x in the equation. The terms involving x are x^3, 2x^2y, -3xy^2, and -6xz^2. The highest power of x is 3, so the degree of f as a polynomial in x is 3.\n\nNow, we want to find the equation of the intersection of the curve given by f(x, y, z) = 0 with the plane z = 0. To do this, we simply substitute z = 0 into the equation f(x, y, z) = 0:\n\nf(x, y, 0) = x^3 + 2x^2y - 3xy^2 + 4y^3 - 6x(0)^2 - 12y(0)^2 - 7(0)^3 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx^3 + 2x^2y - 3xy^2 + 4y^3 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the intersection of the curve with the plane z = 0 is x^3 + 2x^2y - 3xy^2 + 4y^3 = 0."
