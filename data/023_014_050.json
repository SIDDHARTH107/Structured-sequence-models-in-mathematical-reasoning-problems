    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of Ψ(x) = Ae^(-x), we'll use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nΨ(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫ Ψ(x) e^(-ikx) dx, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nFirst, let's find the normalizing constant A. We want the integral of |Ψ(x)|² from -∞ to +∞ to be equal to 1:\n\n1 = ∫ |Ae^(-x)|² dx from -∞ to +∞\n1 = A² ∫ e^(-2x) dx from 0 to +∞ (since the function is 0 for x < 0)\n\nNow, integrate e^(-2x) with respect to x:\n\nA² * [-1/2 * e^(-2x)] from 0 to +∞ = 1\nA² * (1/2) = 1\nA = √2\n\nSo, the normalized wave function is Ψ(x) = √2 e^(-x) for x ≥ 0 and 0 for x < 0.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform:\n\nΨ(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫ Ψ(x) e^(-ikx) dx from -∞ to +∞\nΨ(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫ (√2 e^(-x)) e^(-ikx) dx from 0 to +∞\n\nCombine the exponentials and integrate:\n\nΨ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * √2 ∫ e^(-x(1+ik)) dx from 0 to +∞\nΨ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * √2 * [-1/(1+ik) * e^(-x(1+ik))] from 0 to +∞\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nΨ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * √2 * [-1/(1+ik) * (0 - 1)]\nΨ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * √2 * [1/(1+ik)]\n\nNow, let's find the expectation value of momentum. The momentum operator in the position representation is given by:\n\nP = -iħ ∂/∂x\n\nThe expectation value of momentum is:\n\n⟨P⟩ = ∫ Ψ*(x) P Ψ(x) dx from -∞ to +∞\n\nSince Ψ(x) is real, Ψ*(x) = Ψ(x):\n\n⟨P⟩ = -iħ ∫ Ψ(x) ∂Ψ(x)/∂x dx from -∞ to +∞\n⟨P⟩ = -iħ ∫ (√2 e^(-x)) * (√2 * -e^(-x)) dx from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, integrate:\n\n⟨P⟩ = -iħ * 2 ∫ e^(-2x) dx from 0 to +∞\n⟨P⟩ = -iħ * 2 * [-1/2 * e^(-2x)] from 0 to +∞\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\n⟨P⟩ = -iħ * (0 - 1)\n⟨P⟩ = iħ\n\nSo, the expectation value of momentum is iħ."
