    "message_2": "First, let's write the given system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 3  2  4 | 14 ]\n[ 2 -1  1 |  0 ]\n[ 4  3 -1 | 18 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to convert the matrix to row echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column at the top:\n\n```\n[ 2 -1  1 |  0 ]\n[ 3  2  4 | 14 ]\n[ 4  3 -1 | 18 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the pivot (2) in the first row:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - (3/2) * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 2 * Row 1\n\n```\n[  2  -1   1 |  0  ]\n[  0   7/2  5 |  21 ]\n[  0   5  -3 |  18 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 7/2 to make the pivot 1:\n\nRow 2 = (2/7) * Row 2\n\n```\n[  2  -1   1 |  0  ]\n[  0   1  10/7 |  6 ]\n[  0   5  -3 |  18 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below the pivot (1) in the second row:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 5 * Row 2\n\n```\n[  2  -1   1  |  0  ]\n[  0   1  10/7 |  6  ]\n[  0   0 -11/7 | -12 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -11/7 to make the pivot 1:\n\nRow 3 = (-7/11) * Row 3\n\n```\n[  2  -1   1  |  0  ]\n[  0   1  10/7 |  6  ]\n[  0   0   1   |  7  ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row echelon form. Next, we will use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 6: Substitute the value of z from the third row into the second row:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - (10/7) * Row 3\n\n```\n[  2  -1   1  |  0  ]\n[  0   1   0  | -4  ]\n[  0   0   1  |  7  ]\n```\n\nStep 7: Substitute the values of y and z from the second and third rows into the first row:\n\nRow 1 = Row 1 + Row 2 - Row 3\n\n```\n[  2  0   0  | -4  ]\n[  0  1   0  | -4  ]\n[  0  0   1  |  7  ]\n```\n\nStep 8: Divide the first row by 2 to make the pivot 1:\n\nRow 1 = (1/2) * Row 1\n\n```\n[  1  0   0  | -2  ]\n[  0  1   0  | -4  ]\n[  0  0   1  |  7  ]\n```\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is x = -2, y = -4, and z = 7."
