    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift of the graph from its standard position. In the given function y = 3sin(2x - π/4), the phase shift can be found by looking at the term inside the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, we have y = 3sin(2(x - π/8)). Comparing this to the general form, we can see that the phase shift C is π/8.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function is π/8."
