    "message_1": "Consider a buyer who is interested in purchasing a used car. Suppose there are two types of cars, a high-quality and low-quality car, which are worth $15,000 and $10,000 respectively to the buyer. The seller knows which type of car they are selling, but the buyer does not. The seller can choose to signal whether they have a high-quality or low-quality car by either repairing or not repairing a visible problem with the car. Repairing the problem costs the seller $2,000. If the problem is not repaired, it will be clear that the car is low-quality and the buyer will only be willing to pay $8,000. If the problem is repaired, the buyer will not know whether the car is high-quality or low-quality and will be willing to pay $12,000. As the buyer, what would be your best strategy given this signaling game?",
    "message_2": "As the buyer, your best strategy in this signaling game is to offer $12,000 for cars with the repaired problem and $8,000 for cars with the problem not repaired. This is because when the problem is repaired, you cannot differentiate between high-quality and low-quality cars, so you should be willing to pay the average value of the two types, which is ($15,000 + $10,000) / 2 = $12,000.\n\nWhen the problem is not repaired, it is clear that the car is low-quality, and you should be willing to pay $8,000, which is the value of a low-quality car minus the cost of repairing the problem ($10,000 - $2,000).\n\nThis strategy ensures that you are not overpaying for low-quality cars and that you are still willing to pay a fair price for high-quality cars, given the information available to you."
