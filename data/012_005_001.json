    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nFirst, let's consider the maximum number of edges a graph with 10 vertices can have. A complete graph with 10 vertices (K_10) has the maximum number of edges, which is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of edges = n(n-1)/2\nwhere n is the number of vertices.\n\nFor a graph with 10 vertices:\nNumber of edges = 10(10-1)/2 = 10*9/2 = 45\n\nOur graph has 18 edges, which is less than the maximum number of edges for a graph with 10 vertices. This means that the graph is not a complete graph, and there must be at least one pair of vertices that are not directly connected by an edge.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum diameter of the graph. If the graph were a tree (a connected graph with no cycles), the diameter would be the longest path in the tree. For a tree with 10 vertices, the minimum diameter is 4 (consider a balanced binary tree with 10 vertices).\n\nSince our graph has 18 edges, which is more than the number of edges in a tree with 10 vertices (9 edges), there must be at least one cycle in the graph. This means that the diameter of the graph could be smaller than 4.\n\nHowever, we know that there is at least one pair of vertices that are not directly connected by an edge. Therefore, the diameter of the graph cannot be 1.\n\nNow, let's consider a diameter of 2. If the diameter were 2, then every pair of vertices would be connected by a path of length at most 2. This would mean that every vertex would be connected to at least 9 other vertices by paths of length 1 or 2. In other words, every vertex would have a degree of at least 9. However, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our graph, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 18 = 36. If every vertex had a degree of at least 9, the sum of the degrees would be at least 10 * 9 = 90, which is greater than 36. This means that the diameter of the graph cannot be 2.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the graph must be at least 3. It is possible to construct a graph with 10 vertices, 18 edges, and a diameter of 3 (for example, a graph with a central vertex connected to all other vertices, and additional edges forming a cycle among the outer vertices). Thus, the diameter of the graph is 3."
