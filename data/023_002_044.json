    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x(π - x) over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients.\n\nSince the function is defined over a finite interval and is continuous, we can represent it as a Fourier series. The Fourier series representation of a function f(x) over the interval [0, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a₀/2 + Σ [aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)]\n\nwhere a₀, aₙ, and bₙ are the Fourier coefficients, and they are given by:\n\na₀ = (2/π) ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to π\naₙ = (2/π) ∫[f(x)cos(nx)dx] from 0 to π\nbₙ = (2/π) ∫[f(x)sin(nx)dx] from 0 to π\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients for our function f(x) = x(π - x).\n\na₀ = (2/π) ∫[x(π - x)dx] from 0 to π\na₀ = (2/π) [πx²/2 - x³/3] from 0 to π\na₀ = (2/π) [(π³/2 - π³/3) - 0] = (2/π) (π³/6) = π²/3\n\naₙ = (2/π) ∫[x(π - x)cos(nx)dx] from 0 to π\nTo find aₙ, we can use integration by parts twice:\nLet u = x(π - x), dv = cos(nx)dx\ndu = (π - 2x)dx, v = sin(nx)/n\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, we get:\naₙ = (2/π) [(uv) from 0 to π - ∫vdu from 0 to π]\naₙ = (2/π) [(0 - 0) - ∫(π - 2x)sin(nx)dx/n from 0 to π]\naₙ = (2/π) [-2∫xsin(nx)dx/n from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again:\nLet u = x, dv = sin(nx)dx\ndu = dx, v = -cos(nx)/n\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, we get:\naₙ = (2/π) [-2((-xcos(nx)/n²) from 0 to π + ∫cos(nx)dx/n² from 0 to π)]\naₙ = (2/π) [-2((-πcos(nπ)/n² + 0) + (sin(nx)/n³) from 0 to π)]\naₙ = (2/π) [-2((-1)^(n+1)π/n² + 0)]\n\nSo, aₙ = (4(-1)^(n+1)π/n²)\n\nSince the function is odd, bₙ = 0.\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x(π - x):\n\nf(x) = (π²/3)/2 + Σ [(4(-1)^(n+1)π/n²)cos(nx)]\n\nThe Fourier series converges to the function f(x) = x(π - x) at all points in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π, as the function is continuous and has a finite number of finite discontinuities in its derivatives."
