    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap between three consecutive primes greater than 100, we need to find three prime numbers with the smallest gaps between them.\n\nStarting from the first prime number greater than 100, which is 101, we can find the next two consecutive prime numbers: 103 and 107. The prime gaps between these numbers are:\n\n103 - 101 = 2\n107 - 103 = 4\n\nSo, the smallest prime gap between three consecutive primes greater than 100 is 2 (between 101 and 103)."
