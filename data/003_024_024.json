    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector u onto vector v, we can use the formula:\n\nproj_v(u) = (u • v) / ||v||^2 * v\n\nwhere \"•\" denotes the dot product, and ||v|| denotes the magnitude of vector v.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu • v = (3 * 5) + (4 * -2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector v:\n\n||v|| = √(5^2 + (-2)^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, let's find the square of the magnitude of vector v:\n\n||v||^2 = 29\n\nNow, we can find the projection of vector u onto vector v:\n\nproj_v(u) = (u • v) / ||v||^2 * v = (7 / 29) * (5, -2) = (35/29, -14/29)\n\nSo, the projection of vector u onto vector v is (35/29, -14/29)."
