They have 5 items that they want to take with them, each with a weight and a value as given in the table below.\n\n| Item | Weight (kg) | Value ($) |\n|------|-------------|-----------|\n| A    | 2           | 12        |\n| B    | 1           | 10        |\n| C    | 3           | 20        |\n| D    | 2           | 15        |\n| E    | 1           | 8         |\n\nWhat items should the student take in order to maximize the total value of the items they bring, given the weight capacity of their knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total value of the items the student brings, we need to consider the value-to-weight ratio of each item. We will calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item:\n\n| Item | Weight (kg) | Value ($) | Value-to-Weight Ratio |\n|------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| A    | 2           | 12        | 6                     |\n| B    | 1           | 10        | 10                    |\n| C    | 3           | 20        | 6.67                  |\n| D    | 2           | 15        | 7.5                   |\n| E    | 1           | 8         | 8                     |\n\nNow, we will prioritize the items with the highest value-to-weight ratio while keeping the total weight within the 4 kg limit:\n\n1. Item B: 1 kg, $10\n2. Item D: 2 kg, $15\n3. Item E: 1 kg, $8\n\nThe total weight of items B, D, and E is 4 kg, which is within the knapsack's weight capacity. The total value of these items is $10 + $15 + $8 = $33.\n\nTherefore, the student should take items B, D, and E to maximize the total value of the items they bring, given the weight capacity of their knapsack."
