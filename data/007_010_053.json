    "message_2": "To solve this system of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we will first find the product of the moduli, N, and then find the individual Ni and yi values. Finally, we will compute the solution for x.\n\nStep 1: Find N\nN = 5 * 7 * 11 = 385\n\nStep 2: Find Ni and yi values\nFor each congruence, we will find the Ni value by dividing N by the modulus, and then find the corresponding yi value, which is the modular inverse of Ni.\n\nCongruence 1: x ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nN1 = N / 5 = 385 / 5 = 77\ny1 ≡ 77^(-1) (mod 5)\n\nCongruence 2: x ≡ 4 (mod 7)\nN2 = N / 7 = 385 / 7 = 55\ny2 ≡ 55^(-1) (mod 7)\n\nCongruence 3: x ≡ 2 (mod 11)\nN3 = N / 11 = 385 / 11 = 35\ny3 ≡ 35^(-1) (mod 11)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the modular inverses\ny1 ≡ 77^(-1) (mod 5) => y1 ≡ 2 (mod 5)\ny2 ≡ 55^(-1) (mod 7) => y2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny3 ≡ 35^(-1) (mod 11) => y3 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\n\nStep 4: Compute the solution for x\nx = (3 * 77 * 2) + (4 * 55 * 1) + (2 * 35 * 2)\nx = 462 + 220 + 140\nx = 822\n\nStep 5: Find the smallest positive integer solution\nSince N = 385, we can find the smallest positive integer solution by taking x modulo N:\nx ≡ 822 (mod 385)\nx ≡ 52 (mod 385)\n\nThe smallest positive integer solution for x is 52."
