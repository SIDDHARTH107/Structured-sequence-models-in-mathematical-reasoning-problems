    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v}=(1,2,3)$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)=(3t,4t,5t)$, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve at each point. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\gamma'(t) = (3, 4, 5)$\n\nNow, we need to find a vector that is parallel to the tangent vector at each point on the curve. Since the tangent vector is constant, we can use the cross product to find a vector orthogonal to the tangent vector:\n\n$\\mathbf{v} \\times \\gamma'(t) = (1, 2, 3) \\times (3, 4, 5) = (-2, -1, 2)$\n\nNext, we need to find a vector that is orthogonal to both the tangent vector and the cross product we just found. We can use the cross product again:\n\n$\\gamma'(t) \\times (-2, -1, 2) = (3, 4, 5) \\times (-2, -1, 2) = (3, -10, 5)$\n\nNow, we have a set of three orthogonal vectors: $\\gamma'(t)$, $(-2, -1, 2)$, and $(3, -10, 5)$. We can use these vectors to form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$. To find the parallel transport of $\\mathbf{v}$, we need to express $\\mathbf{v}$ in this new basis:\n\n$\\mathbf{v} = a\\gamma'(t) + b(-2, -1, 2) + c(3, -10, 5)$\n\nSolving for $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get:\n\n$a = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$b = -\\frac{1}{3}$\n$c = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nNow, we can find the parallel transport of $\\mathbf{v}$ by moving along the curve from $\\gamma(0)$ to $\\gamma(1)$:\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{parallel}} = a\\gamma'(1) + b(-2, -1, 2) + c(3, -10, 5)$\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{parallel}} = \\frac{1}{3}(3, 4, 5) - \\frac{1}{3}(-2, -1, 2) + \\frac{1}{3}(3, -10, 5)$\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{parallel}} = (1, 2, 3)$\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v}=(1,2,3)$ from the point $\\gamma(0)$ to the point $\\gamma(1)$ is $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{parallel}} = (1, 2, 3)$."
