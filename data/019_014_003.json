    "message_2": "To prove that for all integers x and y, if x is even and y is odd, then x + y is odd, we will use the definitions of even and odd integers and basic properties of arithmetic.\n\nDefinitions:\n1. An integer x is even if there exists an integer k such that x = 2k.\n2. An integer y is odd if there exists an integer l such that y = 2l + 1.\n\nProof:\nLet x be an even integer and y be an odd integer. By the definitions of even and odd integers, we can say that there exist integers k and l such that:\n\nx = 2k (since x is even)\ny = 2l + 1 (since y is odd)\n\nNow, we want to show that x + y is odd. To do this, we will add x and y:\n\nx + y = (2k) + (2l + 1) = 2k + 2l + 1\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\nx + y = 2(k + l) + 1\n\nLet m = k + l. Since k and l are integers (as they are the result of the definitions of even and odd integers), their sum m is also an integer.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nx + y = 2m + 1\n\nThis is the same form as the definition of an odd integer (2l + 1). Therefore, we have shown that if x is even and y is odd, then x + y is odd."
