    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω), we will use the definition of the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[F(ω) * e^(jωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nGiven F(ω) = 5/(jω+2) - 3jω/(ω^2+9), we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[(5/(jω+2) - 3jω/(ω^2+9)) * e^(jωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of each term separately:\n\n1) For the first term, let's consider G1(ω) = 5/(jω+2). We want to find the inverse Fourier transform g1(t):\n\ng1(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[(5/(jω+2)) * e^(jωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral can be solved using the residue theorem from complex analysis. The pole of the function is at ω = -2j. The residue at this pole is:\n\nResidue = lim(ω -> -2j) [(ω + 2j) * (5/(jω+2)) * e^(jωt)]\n               = 5 * e^(-2jt)\n\nSince the pole is in the lower half-plane, we need to consider a semi-circle contour in the lower half-plane. Thus, the inverse Fourier transform g1(t) is:\n\ng1(t) = 0 for t > 0\ng1(t) = (1 / 2π) * 2π * (-1) * 5 * e^(-2jt) for t < 0\ng1(t) = -5 * e^(2t) for t < 0\n\n2) For the second term, let's consider G2(ω) = -3jω/(ω^2+9). We want to find the inverse Fourier transform g2(t):\n\ng2(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[(-3jω/(ω^2+9)) * e^(jωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nAgain, we can use the residue theorem. The poles of the function are at ω = ±3j. The residues at these poles are:\n\nResidue(ω = 3j) = lim(ω -> 3j) [(ω - 3j) * (-3jω/(ω^2+9)) * e^(jωt)]\n                          = -3j * (3j) * e^(-3jt) / (6j)\n                          = -3 * e^(-3jt) / 2\n\nResidue(ω = -3j) = lim(ω -> -3j) [(ω + 3j) * (-3jω/(ω^2+9)) * e^(jωt)]\n                           = -3j * (-3j) * e^(3jt) / (-6j)\n                           = 3 * e^(3jt) / 2\n\nSince both poles are on the imaginary axis, we need to consider a semi-circle contour in the upper half-plane for t > 0 and in the lower half-plane for t < 0. Thus, the inverse Fourier transform g2(t) is:\n\ng2(t) = (1 / 2π) * 2π * (3 * e^(3jt) / 2) for t > 0\ng2(t) = (1 / 2π) * 2π * (-3 * e^(-3jt) / 2) for t < 0\ng2(t) = (3/2) * e^(3t) for t < 0\ng2(t) = (3/2) * e^(-3t) for t > 0\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform f(t) by adding g1(t) and g2(t):\n\nf(t) = g1(t) + g2(t)\nf(t) = -5 * e^(2t) + (3/2) * e^(3t) for t < 0\nf(t) = (3/2) * e^(-3t) for t > 0"
