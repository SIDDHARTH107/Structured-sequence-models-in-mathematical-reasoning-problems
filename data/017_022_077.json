    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 60: 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of groups of order 60 using the formula for groups of order p^a * q^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are their respective powers in the prime factorization. In this case, p = 2, q = 3, a = 2, and b = 1. The formula is (p^(a+1) - p) * (q^(b+1) - q) / (p - 1)(q - 1). Plugging in the values, we get (2^(2+1) - 2) * (3^(1+1) - 3) / (2 - 1)(3 - 1) = (8 - 2) * (9 - 3) / (1)(2) = 6 * 6 / 2 = 18.\n3. Subtract the number of abelian groups of order 60. There are 5 abelian groups of order 60: C60, C2 × C30, C3 × C20, C4 × C15, and C6 × C10.\n4. Subtract the number of groups isomorphic to A5 × C2. There is only 1 such group.\n\nSo, the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, not isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2, is 18 - 5 - 1 = 12."
