    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the equation y = 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 8, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. \n\n0 = 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 8\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots algebraically can be quite complex. However, we can approximate the x-intercepts by graphing the equation on a coordinate plane.\n\nUpon graphing the equation, we can observe that the curve intersects the x-axis at approximately three points:\n\n1. x ≈ -1.0\n2. x ≈ 1.3\n3. x ≈ 2.0\n\nThese are the approximate x-intercepts of the equation y = 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 8. Keep in mind that these are approximations, and the actual values may be slightly different."
