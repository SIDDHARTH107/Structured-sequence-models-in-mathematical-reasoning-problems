Calculate the first three groups of the Heegaard Floer homology, denoted by $\\widehat{HF}(S)$, for each of the following cases:\n\na) g=0, S is a torus.\nb) g=1, S is a double torus.\nc) g=2, S is a triple torus.\n\nNote: Assume all computations are done over the field $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Heegaard Floer homology groups, we first need to determine the Heegaard diagrams for each surface. We will use the standard Heegaard diagrams for each case.\n\na) g=0, S is a torus.\n\nFor a torus, the Heegaard diagram consists of two circles intersecting at a single point. The Heegaard Floer homology groups are:\n\n$\\widehat{HF}(S) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nb) g=1, S is a double torus.\n\nFor a double torus, the Heegaard diagram consists of four circles intersecting pairwise at four points. The Heegaard Floer homology groups are:\n\n$\\widehat{HF}(S) = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\oplus 3}$\n\nc) g=2, S is a triple torus.\n\nFor a triple torus, the Heegaard diagram consists of six circles intersecting pairwise at nine points. The Heegaard Floer homology groups are:\n\n$\\widehat{HF}(S) = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\oplus 9}$\n\nIn summary, the first three groups of the Heegaard Floer homology for the given cases are:\n\na) $\\widehat{HF}(S) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\nb) $\\widehat{HF}(S) = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\oplus 3}$\nc) $\\widehat{HF}(S) = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\oplus 9}$"
