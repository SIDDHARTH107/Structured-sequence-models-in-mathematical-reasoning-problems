    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that undergoes a series of iterations to increase its length. At each iteration, the curve is divided into four smaller copies of itself, and each copy is scaled down by a factor of 2. The length of the curve increases by a factor of 2 at each iteration.\n\nAt the first iteration (level 1), the Hilbert curve has a length of 4 units (it consists of 4 segments, each of length 1 unit).\n\nAt the second iteration (level 2), the curve is divided into four smaller copies, each with a length of 4 units, and the total length becomes 4 * 2 = 8 units.\n\nAt the third iteration (level 3), the curve is again divided into four smaller copies, each with a length of 8 units, and the total length becomes 8 * 2 = 16 units.\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve up to level 3 is 16 units."
