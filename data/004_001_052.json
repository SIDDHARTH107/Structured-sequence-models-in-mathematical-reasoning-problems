    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x with respect to x, we will use the power rule. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^3)/dx - d(5x^2)/dx + d(2x)/dx\n\nFor the first term, 3x^3:\nn = 3, so the derivative is 3 * 3x^(3-1) = 9x^2\n\nFor the second term, -5x^2:\nn = 2, so the derivative is -5 * 2x^(2-1) = -10x\n\nFor the third term, 2x:\nn = 1, so the derivative is 2 * 1x^(1-1) = 2\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 9x^2 - 10x + 2"
