    "message_1": "Let F be a Fano variety of dimension 3 and index 2, meaning its anticanonical divisor D satisfies D^3 = 2D^2. If H is an ample divisor on F that satisfies H^3 = 12, what is the degree of H on F?",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of H on F, we need to compute the intersection number H^3, which is given as 12. The degree of a divisor on a variety is the intersection number of the divisor with itself (in this case, H^3). Therefore, the degree of H on F is 12."
