    "message_2": "Let's denote the triangle as ABC, where angle A is 40 degrees, angle B is 80 degrees, and side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is opposite angle C. We are given that side b has a length of 6 units.\n\nFirst, we need to find the measure of angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can calculate angle C as follows:\n\nangle C = 180 - (angle A + angle B) = 180 - (40 + 80) = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the length of side c. The law of sines states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is the same for all three sides of the triangle:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe are given the length of side b and the measures of angles B and C, so we can use the law of sines to find the length of side c:\n\nc / sin(C) = b / sin(B)\n\nc / sin(60) = 6 / sin(80)\n\nNow we can solve for c:\n\nc = (6 / sin(80)) * sin(60)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that sin(80) ≈ 0.9848 and sin(60) ≈ 0.8660. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc ≈ (6 / 0.9848) * 0.8660 ≈ 5.27\n\nTherefore, the length of the third side (side c) is approximately 5.27 units."
