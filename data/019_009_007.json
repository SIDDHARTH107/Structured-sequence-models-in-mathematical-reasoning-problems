    "message_2": "To prove that 4 is an even number using Intuitionistic logic, the student can use the definition of even numbers and the basic axioms of arithmetic. An even number is defined as any integer that can be expressed as 2n, where n is an integer.\n\nLogical statement:\n\n∃n ∈ ℤ (4 = 2n)\n\nProof:\n\nLet n = 2, which is an integer.\n\nThen, 4 = 2 * 2 = 2n.\n\nThus, there exists an integer n such that 4 can be expressed as 2n, proving that 4 is an even number."
