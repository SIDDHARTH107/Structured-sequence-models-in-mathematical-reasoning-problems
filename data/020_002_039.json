    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem:\n\nA company manufactures two products, A and B. The unit profit for product A is $5 and for product B is $7. They have a constraint on their production capacity of 5000 units. They cannot sell more than 2500 units of product A. Also, they cannot sell more than 2000 units of product B. Currently, the company is selling 2000 units of product A and 1500 units of product B. They are planning to increase their profit by optimizing the production level using nonlinear programming. Find the optimal production level for each product to maximize the profit.\n\nCan you solve this problem?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 5000 (production capacity constraint)\n2. x ≤ 2500 (maximum units of product A constraint)\n3. y ≤ 2000 (maximum units of product B constraint)\n\nSince the profit function is linear, we can solve this problem using linear programming. We'll analyze the feasible region determined by the constraints and find the maximum profit at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the intersections of the constraint lines:\n\n1. (0, 0) - intersection of x-axis and y-axis\n2. (2500, 0) - intersection of x-axis and x = 2500\n3. (0, 2000) - intersection of y-axis and y = 2000\n4. (2500, 2500) - intersection of x = 2500 and x + y = 5000\n5. (5000, 0) - intersection of x-axis and x + y = 5000\n6. (0, 5000) - intersection of y-axis and x + y = 5000\n\nHowever, points (5) and (6) are not in the feasible region because they violate constraints 2 and 3, respectively. So, we only need to consider points (1), (2), (3), and (4).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at these points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(2500, 0) = 5(2500) + 7(0) = 12500\n3. P(0, 2000) = 5(0) + 7(2000) = 14000\n4. P(2500, 2500) = 5(2500) + 7(2500) = 30000\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at point (4), with 2500 units of product A and 2500 units of product B. The maximum profit is $30,000."
