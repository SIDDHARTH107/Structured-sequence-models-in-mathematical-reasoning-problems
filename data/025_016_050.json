Show that $C$ is birational to the line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, i.e., there exists a rational map from $C$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$ whose inverse is also rational.\n\nHints: To show that $C$ is birational to $\\mathbb{P}^1$, it suffices to find a birational map from $C$ to some open subset of $\\mathbb{P}^1$, and then extend it to a map from $C$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$ using the fact that birational maps between smooth projective curves are always regular. One way to find such a map is to use the fact that $C$ has a singular point at $P = [0:1:0]$, which can be resolved by blowing up $P$ and then contracting the exceptional divisor. This yields a new curve $\\tilde{C}$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, which is smooth and intersecting each line $L = \\{z = \\text{constant}\\}$ in a single point. Now consider the degree-two rational map $f: C \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1$ given by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto [x:y]$, and show that it extends to a regular map from $\\tilde{C}$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$ whose inverse is also regular.",
    "message_2": "First, let's blow up the singular point $P = [0:1:0]$ on the curve $C$. We do this by introducing a new coordinate system $(u:v:w)$ such that $x = uv$ and $y = vw$. In these new coordinates, the equation of the curve becomes:\n\n$v^2w^2 - u^3v^2 - u^2v^3 = 0$.\n\nNow, we can factor out $v^2$:\n\n$v^2(w^2 - u^3 - u^2v) = 0$.\n\nSince $v = 0$ corresponds to the exceptional divisor, we are interested in the curve $\\tilde{C}$ defined by the equation $w^2 - u^3 - u^2v = 0$. This curve is smooth and intersects each line $L = \\{w = \\text{constant}\\}$ in a single point.\n\nNow, consider the degree-two rational map $f: C \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1$ given by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto [x:y]$. In the new coordinates $(u:v:w)$, this map becomes $(u:v:w) \\mapsto [u:v]$. We want to show that this map extends to a regular map from $\\tilde{C}$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\nTo do this, we need to check that the map is well-defined on $\\tilde{C}$. Since the equation of $\\tilde{C}$ is $w^2 - u^3 - u^2v = 0$, we see that the map $(u:v:w) \\mapsto [u:v]$ sends points on $\\tilde{C}$ to points on the line $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Moreover, this map is clearly regular, as it is given by the linear functions $u$ and $v$.\n\nNow, we need to show that the inverse map is also regular. The inverse map is given by $[u:v] \\mapsto (u:v:w(u,v))$, where $w(u,v)$ is determined by the equation of $\\tilde{C}$: $w^2 = u^3 + u^2v$. Since the right-hand side of this equation is a polynomial in $u$ and $v$, the function $w(u,v)$ is rational. Therefore, the inverse map is also regular.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists a regular map from $\\tilde{C}$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$ whose inverse is also regular, which implies that $C$ is birational to the line $\\mathbb{P}^1$."
