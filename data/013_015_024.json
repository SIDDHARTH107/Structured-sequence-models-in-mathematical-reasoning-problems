    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student studying Game Theory and the Principal-Agent Problem:\n\nA manufacturer hires a manager to oversee production of a new product. The manager has a choice between implementing a high-quality process that costs $100,000, or a low-quality process that costs $50,000. The high-quality process will result in a product worth $150,000, while the low-quality process will result in a product worth only $100,000. However, the manager's effort level to implement the high-quality process is unobservable to the manufacturer, and the manager will receive a bonus of $20,000 regardless of which process is chosen. If the manufacturer wants to incentivize the manager to choose the high-quality process, what bonus should they offer as a function of the observed product quality?\n\nThe above problem can be solved using Game Theory and the Principal-Agent Problem framework to determine the optimal bonus amount to ensure that the manager acts in the manufacturer's best interests.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the bonus structure that incentivizes the manager to choose the high-quality process. Let's denote the bonus for the high-quality product as B_H and the bonus for the low-quality product as B_L.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the manager's payoff for each process:\n\n1. High-quality process:\nManager's payoff = (Product value - Process cost) + B_H\nManager's payoff = ($150,000 - $100,000) + B_H\nManager's payoff = $50,000 + B_H\n\n2. Low-quality process:\nManager's payoff = (Product value - Process cost) + B_L\nManager's payoff = ($100,000 - $50,000) + B_L\nManager's payoff = $50,000 + B_L\n\nFor the manager to choose the high-quality process, their payoff for the high-quality process must be greater than their payoff for the low-quality process:\n\n$50,000 + B_H > $50,000 + B_L\n\nNow, let's find the minimum bonus difference that will incentivize the manager to choose the high-quality process:\n\nB_H - B_L > 0\n\nSince the manager will receive a bonus of $20,000 regardless of which process is chosen, we can set B_L = $20,000. Then, we need to find the minimum B_H that satisfies the inequality:\n\nB_H - $20,000 > 0\n\nB_H > $20,000\n\nSo, the manufacturer should offer a bonus of more than $20,000 for the high-quality product to incentivize the manager to choose the high-quality process. The bonus function can be represented as:\n\nB_H = $20,000 + x, where x > 0\n\nThis means that the manufacturer should offer a bonus of at least $20,001 for the high-quality product to ensure that the manager chooses the high-quality process."
