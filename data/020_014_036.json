    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the non-convex function $f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2$, we can use a non-linear optimization method such as the Newton-Raphson method. \n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of the function $f(x)$:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9$\n\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 6x - 12$\n\nNow, we will use the Newton-Raphson method to find the critical points of the function. The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method that can be used to find the roots of a real-valued function. The method starts with an initial guess $x_0$ and iteratively refines the guess using the formula:\n\n$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f'(x_n)}{f''(x_n)}$\n\nWe will apply this method to find the critical points of $f(x)$, i.e., the points where $f'(x) = 0$. Let's start with an initial guess $x_0 = 0$:\n\n$x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{f'(x_0)}{f''(x_0)} = 0 - \\frac{3(0)^2 - 12(0) + 9}{6(0) - 12} = 0 - \\frac{9}{-12} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, we will iterate the Newton-Raphson method until convergence:\n\n$x_2 = x_1 - \\frac{f'(x_1)}{f''(x_1)} = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3(\\frac{3}{4})^2 - 12(\\frac{3}{4}) + 9}{6(\\frac{3}{4}) - 12} \\approx 1.999$\n\n$x_3 = x_2 - \\frac{f'(x_2)}{f''(x_2)} \\approx 1.999 - \\frac{3(1.999)^2 - 12(1.999) + 9}{6(1.999) - 12} \\approx 2.000$\n\nSince $x_3 \\approx x_2$, we can conclude that the Newton-Raphson method has converged, and the critical point is $x \\approx 2$.\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point corresponds to a minimum or maximum. We can do this by evaluating the second derivative at this point:\n\n$f''(2) = 6(2) - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0$\n\nSince the second derivative is equal to zero, we cannot determine if this is a minimum or maximum using the second derivative test. However, we can analyze the function and its derivatives to determine the nature of the critical point.\n\nThe first derivative, $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9$, can be factored as $f'(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 3)$. This means that the first derivative changes sign at $x = 1$ and $x = 3$. Since the function is non-convex, we can conclude that the global minimum occurs at the critical point $x \\approx 2$.\n\nFinally, we can find the global minimum value of the function by evaluating $f(x)$ at the critical point:\n\n$f(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) + 2 = 8 - 24 + 18 + 2 = 4$\n\nThus, the global minimum of the function $f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2$ is $4$ at $x \\approx 2$."
