    "message_1": "In a factory, there are 120 employees who work with heavy machinery. The probability of an accident occurring to any employee is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 6 accidents occur in a week?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 6 accidents occurring in a week, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k accidents occurring\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of employees (120 in this case)\n- k is the number of accidents (we want at least 6)\n- p is the probability of an accident occurring for an individual employee (0.05)\n\nSince we want the probability of at least 6 accidents, we need to find the probability of 6, 7, 8, ..., 120 accidents occurring and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of 0 to 5 accidents occurring and subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, we will calculate P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5), and then subtract the sum from 1.\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula for each value of k from 0 to 5:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(120, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(120-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^120 ≈ 0.000006\nP(X = 1) = C(120, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(120-1) ≈ 0.000158\nP(X = 2) = C(120, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (1-0.05)^(120-2) ≈ 0.002045\nP(X = 3) = C(120, 3) * (0.05)^3 * (1-0.05)^(120-3) ≈ 0.013524\nP(X = 4) = C(120, 4) * (0.05)^4 * (1-0.05)^(120-4) ≈ 0.049768\nP(X = 5) = C(120, 5) * (0.05)^5 * (1-0.05)^(120-5) ≈ 0.110273\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 5) = 0.000006 + 0.000158 + 0.002045 + 0.013524 + 0.049768 + 0.110273 ≈ 0.175774\n\nFinally, subtract this sum from 1 to find the probability of at least 6 accidents:\n\nP(X ≥ 6) = 1 - P(X ≤ 5) = 1 - 0.175774 ≈ 0.824226\n\nSo, the probability of at least 6 accidents occurring in a week is approximately 0.824 or 82.4%."
