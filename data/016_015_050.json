    "message_2": "The total length of a Hilbert curve can be found using the formula L = N * S, where L is the total length, N is the number of segments, and S is the length of each segment.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, there are 4^3 = 64 segments. If each segment has a length of 1, then the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 3 is:\n\nL = 64 * 1 = 64 units."
