    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem:\n\nAn archaeologist found a fossil that contains 60 grams of Carbon-14. Given that the half-life of Carbon-14 is approximately 5730 years, determine the age of the fossil assuming that the original sample contained 480 grams of Carbon-14. Round your answer to the nearest year.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(Time Passed / Half-Life)\n\nIn this case, the final amount is 60 grams, the initial amount is 480 grams, and the half-life is 5730 years. We need to find the time passed. Let's call the time passed \"t\".\n\n60 = 480 * (1/2)^(t / 5730)\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"t\". First, divide both sides by 480:\n\n(60 / 480) = (1/2)^(t / 5730)\n\n0.125 = (1/2)^(t / 5730)\n\nNext, take the logarithm of both sides with base 1/2:\n\nlog_(1/2)(0.125) = log_(1/2)((1/2)^(t / 5730))\n\n-3 = t / 5730\n\nFinally, multiply both sides by 5730 to find the value of \"t\":\n\nt = -3 * 5730\n\nt â‰ˆ 17190 years\n\nSo, the age of the fossil is approximately 17,190 years."
