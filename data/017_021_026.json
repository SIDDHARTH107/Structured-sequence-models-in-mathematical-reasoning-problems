    "message_2": "There are 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, which can be classified into 5 families:\n\n1. Semi-direct products of C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 by C_3 (3 groups)\n2. Semi-direct products of C_4 × C_4 by C_3 (2 groups)\n3. Semi-direct products of C_8 × C_2 by C_3 (4 groups)\n4. Semi-direct products of C_4 × C_2 × C_2 by C_3 (4 groups)\n5. The group C_2 × A_4 (1 group)\n\nThese non-abelian groups differ from the cyclic group C48 and the alternating group A4 × C4 in several ways:\n\n1. C48 is an abelian group, meaning that the group operation is commutative (i.e., a * b = b * a for all elements a and b in the group). None of the 14 non-abelian groups have this property.\n\n2. The structure of C48 is simple, as it is generated by a single element of order 48. The non-abelian groups have more complex structures, as they are built from smaller groups through semi-direct products or direct products.\n\n3. The alternating group A4 × C4 is a direct product of two smaller groups, A4 and C4. This means that the group operation can be performed independently in each of the two factors. The non-abelian groups, on the other hand, are formed through semi-direct products, which involve a more intricate interaction between the smaller groups.\n\n4. The group A4 × C4 has a normal subgroup isomorphic to A4, which is a simple group. Most of the non-abelian groups of order 48 do not have a simple normal subgroup.\n\nIn summary, the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48 have more complex structures than the cyclic group C48 and the alternating group A4 × C4, and they do not possess the commutative property of the abelian groups."
