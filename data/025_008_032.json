If the Hodge decomposition theorem holds for X, i.e., H¹(X,ℚ) is the direct sum of its Hodge substructures, with Hodge numbers h¹,0 = h⁰,¹ = r, h¹,1 = h⁰,² = s, and h¹,0 = h⁰,¹ = 0 for i ≠ j, find the value of (r+s)ⁿ.",
    "message_2": "The Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a complex projective variety X of dimension n, its first cohomology group with rational coefficients, H¹(X,ℚ), can be written as a direct sum of its Hodge substructures. In this case, we are given the Hodge numbers h¹,0 = h⁰,¹ = r, h¹,1 = h⁰,² = s, and h¹,0 = h⁰,¹ = 0 for i ≠ j.\n\nThe Hodge decomposition theorem can be written as:\n\nH¹(X,ℚ) = H¹,0(X) ⊕ H⁰,¹(X) ⊕ H¹,1(X) ⊕ H⁰,²(X)\n\nUsing the given Hodge numbers, we can rewrite this as:\n\nH¹(X,ℚ) = H¹,0(X) ⊕ H⁰,¹(X) ⊕ H¹,1(X) ⊕ H⁰,²(X)\nH¹(X,ℚ) = r ⊕ r ⊕ s ⊕ s\n\nNow, we are asked to find the value of (r+s)ⁿ. Since r and s are the dimensions of the Hodge substructures, their sum represents the total dimension of the cohomology group H¹(X,ℚ). Therefore, (r+s) is the total dimension of the first cohomology group, and raising it to the power of n gives us the number of elements in the cohomology group for an n-dimensional complex projective variety.\n\nThus, the value of (r+s)ⁿ is the number of elements in the first cohomology group of an n-dimensional complex projective variety with the given Hodge numbers."
