    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n2x + 3y = 8\n\nSince the equations are the same, they represent the same line in the coordinate plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, as every point on the line is a solution.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\n3y = 8 - 2x\n\ny = (8 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow we have a general solution for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (8 - 2x) / 3\n\nThis equation represents all the possible solutions for the given system of linear equations."
