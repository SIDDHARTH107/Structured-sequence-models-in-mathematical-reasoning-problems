    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log(base 3)(x-1) + log(base 3)(x+7) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the product rule, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(ab). Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n\nlog(base 3)((x-1)(x+7)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log(base b)(a) = c, then a = b^c. In our case, this means:\n\n(x-1)(x+7) = 3^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(x-1)(x+7) = 9\n\nExpanding the equation, we have:\n\nx^2 + 7x - x - 7 = 9\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nx^2 + 6x - 7 = 9\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides to set the equation to 0:\n\nx^2 + 6x - 16 = 0\n\nNow, we can try to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x + 8)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx + 8 = 0 => x = -8\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original logarithmic equation. If we plug in x = -8:\n\nlog(base 3)(-8-1) + log(base 3)(-8+7) = log(base 3)(-9) + log(base 3)(-1)\n\nSince we cannot take the logarithm of a negative number, x = -8 is not a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's plug in x = 2:\n\nlog(base 3)(2-1) + log(base 3)(2+7) = log(base 3)(1) + log(base 3)(9)\n\nWe know that log(base 3)(1) = 0 and log(base 3)(9) = 2, so:\n\n0 + 2 = 2\n\nThis solution is valid, so the only solution to the logarithmic equation is x = 2."
