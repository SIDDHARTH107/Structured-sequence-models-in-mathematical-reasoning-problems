    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 96: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the formula: p(n) = product of (m_i + 1), where m_i are the exponents of the prime factors in the factorization. In this case, p(96) = (5 + 1)(1 + 1) = 6 * 2 = 12.\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: g(n) = p(n) + sum of g(d), where d divides n and d < n. In this case, the divisors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 48.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of non-isomorphic groups for each divisor:\n\n- g(1) = 1 (trivial group)\n- g(2) = 1 (Z_2)\n- g(3) = 1 (Z_3)\n- g(4) = 2 (Z_4 and Z_2 x Z_2)\n- g(6) = 2 (Z_6 and Z_2 x Z_3)\n- g(8) = 5 (Z_8, Z_2 x Z_4, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, Q_8, and D_4)\n- g(12) = 5 (Z_12, Z_2 x Z_6, Z_3 x Z_4, A_4, and D_6)\n- g(16) = 14\n- g(24) = 15\n- g(32) = 51\n- g(48) = 52\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96:\n\ng(96) = p(96) + g(1) + g(2) + g(3) + g(4) + g(6) + g(8) + g(12) + g(16) + g(24) + g(32) + g(48)\ng(96) = 12 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 14 + 15 + 51 + 52\ng(96) = 161\n\nTherefore, there are 161 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
