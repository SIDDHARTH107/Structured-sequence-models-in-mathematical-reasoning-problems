    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the Fourier transform of f(t) = 2te^(-3t)cos(2t). The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t)e^(-jωt)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n\nFor f(t) = 2te^(-3t)cos(2t), we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[2te^(-3t)cos(2t)e^(-jωt)dt] from 0 to ∞ (since f(t) = 0 for t < 0)\n\nNow, let's integrate by parts. Let u = 2te^(-3t) and dv = cos(2t)e^(-jωt)dt. Then, du = (2e^(-3t) - 6te^(-3t))dt and v = ∫cos(2t)e^(-jωt)dt = (1/2)e^(-jωt)[(jω - 2)sin(2t) + 2cos(2t)]/(ω^2 + 4).\n\nNow, using integration by parts:\n\nF(ω) = uv|₀^∞ - ∫vdu from 0 to ∞\n\nF(ω) = [(1/2)e^(-3t)e^(-jωt)[(jω - 2)sin(2t) + 2cos(2t)]/(ω^2 + 4)]|₀^∞ - ∫[(1/2)e^(-3t)e^(-jωt)[(jω - 2)sin(2t) + 2cos(2t)]/(ω^2 + 4)](2e^(-3t) - 6te^(-3t))dt from 0 to ∞\n\nEvaluating the first term:\n\nlim (t→∞) [(1/2)e^(-3t)e^(-jωt)[(jω - 2)sin(2t) + 2cos(2t)]/(ω^2 + 4)] = 0\n\nAt t = 0, the term becomes:\n\n(1/2)[(jω - 2)sin(0) + 2cos(0)]/(ω^2 + 4) = 1/(ω^2 + 4)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second term:\n\n∫[(1/2)e^(-3t)e^(-jωt)[(jω - 2)sin(2t) + 2cos(2t)]/(ω^2 + 4)](2e^(-3t) - 6te^(-3t))dt from 0 to ∞\n\nThis integral is quite complex, and it's easier to solve the given differential equation directly.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ny'' + 6y' + 13y = 0\n\nThis is a linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 6r + 13 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4*13))/2 = -3 ± 2j\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-3t)[C1*cos(2t) + C2*sin(2t)]\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 1 => e^(0)[C1*cos(0) + C2*sin(0)] = C1 = 1\n\ny'(t) = -3e^(-3t)[cos(2t) + C2*sin(2t)] + e^(-3t)[-2C1*sin(2t) + 2C2*cos(2t)]\n\ny'(0) = -4 => -3[C1 + 0] + [0 + 2C2] = -4 => 2C2 - 3 = -4 => C2 = -1/2\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-3t)[cos(2t) - (1/2)sin(2t)]"
