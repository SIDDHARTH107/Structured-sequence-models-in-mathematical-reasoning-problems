    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit for each unit of Product A is $5 and for each unit of Product B is $7. The factory has a production capacity of 70 units per day. In addition, it requires a total of 110 hours of labor to produce one unit of Product A and 145 hours for each unit of Product B. Write a quadratic program to determine the maximum profit that can be obtained per day by the factory if they produce both types of products.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced per day. The objective function to maximize the profit is given by:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 70 (The factory can produce a maximum of 70 units per day)\n2. Labor constraint: 110x + 145y ≤ L (Total labor hours available for production)\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the value of L, the total labor hours available for production. We can do this by finding the maximum number of hours required to produce 70 units of each product:\n\nMax hours for Product A: 70 * 110 = 7700 hours\nMax hours for Product B: 70 * 145 = 10150 hours\n\nWe can assume that the factory has enough labor hours to produce the maximum number of units for both products. Therefore, we can set L = 10150 hours.\n\nNow we can rewrite the labor constraint as:\n\n110x + 145y ≤ 10150\n\nTo solve the quadratic program, we can use the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 70\n2. 110x + 145y ≤ 10150\n\nNext, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraints intersect. These vertices will be the possible solutions for the maximum profit.\n\nAfter finding the vertices, we can evaluate the objective function P(x, y) at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nFinally, we can choose the production levels of Product A and Product B that correspond to the maximum profit."
