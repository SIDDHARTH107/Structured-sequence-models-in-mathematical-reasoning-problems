    "message_2": "To find the angle between the two paths, we can use the dot product formula for vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||)\n\nwhere A and B are the vectors representing the paths, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, we need to find the vectors A and B:\n\nVector A = B - A = (-4 - 3, -5 - 2) = (-7, -7)\nVector B = C - A = (-1 - 3, -4 - 2) = (-4, -6)\n\nNext, we find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nA · B = (-7 * -4) + (-7 * -6) = 28 + 42 = 70\n\nNow, we find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n||A|| = √((-7)^2 + (-7)^2) = √(49 + 49) = √98\n||B|| = √((-4)^2 + (-6)^2) = √(16 + 36) = √52\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||) = 70 / (√98 * √52) ≈ 0.866\n\nFinally, we find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(0.866) ≈ 30.3°\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the two paths is approximately 30°."
