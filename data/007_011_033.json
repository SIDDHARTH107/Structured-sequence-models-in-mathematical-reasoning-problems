    "message_2": "To solve the equation x^2 ≡ 25 (mod 26), we need to find all x values in the range 0 ≤ x < 26 such that x^2 - 25 is divisible by 26.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation as x^2 - 25 ≡ 0 (mod 26). Now, we can factor the left side of the equation:\n\nx^2 - 25 = (x - 5)(x + 5).\n\nNow, we need to find all x values in the given range such that (x - 5)(x + 5) is divisible by 26.\n\nLet's test the values of x in the given range:\n\n1. x = 0: (0 - 5)(0 + 5) = (-5)(5) = -25 ≡ 1 (mod 26) (not divisible by 26)\n2. x = 1: (1 - 5)(1 + 5) = (-4)(6) = -24 ≡ 2 (mod 26) (not divisible by 26)\n3. x = 2: (2 - 5)(2 + 5) = (-3)(7) = -21 ≡ 5 (mod 26) (not divisible by 26)\n4. x = 3: (3 - 5)(3 + 5) = (-2)(8) = -16 ≡ 10 (mod 26) (not divisible by 26)\n5. x = 4: (4 - 5)(4 + 5) = (-1)(9) = -9 ≡ 17 (mod 26) (not divisible by 26)\n6. x = 5: (5 - 5)(5 + 5) = (0)(10) = 0 ≡ 0 (mod 26) (divisible by 26)\n7. x = 6: (6 - 5)(6 + 5) = (1)(11) = 11 ≡ 11 (mod 26) (not divisible by 26)\n...\n21. x = 21: (21 - 5)(21 + 5) = (16)(26) = 416 ≡ 0 (mod 26) (divisible by 26)\n\nWe found two solutions in the given range: x = 5 and x = 21. Therefore, the equation x^2 ≡ 25 (mod 26) has two solutions: x = 5 and x = 21."
