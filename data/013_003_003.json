    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given $10 and has to propose a split with Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, both players get the proposed amounts. If Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. What is the minimum amount Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to guarantee that Player 2 accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the rational decision for Player 2 is to accept any offer greater than $0, as receiving some money is better than receiving none. Therefore, the minimum amount Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to guarantee that Player 2 accepts the offer is $0.01, assuming the smallest unit of currency is one cent."
