    "message_1": "Suppose that in a community of 500 people, 180 of them like to attend music concerts. If you randomly select 50 people from the community, what is the probability that at least 25 of them like to attend music concerts?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 25 of the 50 randomly selected people like to attend music concerts, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a person liking music concerts)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of people selected)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people who like music concerts)\n\nIn this problem, n = 50, p = 180/500 = 0.36 (since 180 out of 500 people like music concerts), and we want to find the probability that at least 25 people like music concerts (k ≥ 25).\n\nTo find the probability of at least 25 successes, we can find the probability of 24 or fewer successes and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X ≤ 24)\n\nWe can calculate P(X ≤ 24) by summing the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 24:\n\nP(X ≤ 24) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 24\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities for each value of k:\n\nP(X ≤ 24) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.36)^k * (1-0.36)^(50-k)] for k = 0 to 24\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 24) ≈ 0.7586\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 25 successes:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X ≤ 24) = 1 - 0.7586 ≈ 0.2414\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 of the 50 randomly selected people like to attend music concerts is approximately 0.2414 or 24.14%."
