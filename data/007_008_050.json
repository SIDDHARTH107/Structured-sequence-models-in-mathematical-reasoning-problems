    "message_2": "We will use the concept of modular arithmetic to solve this problem. We want to find the remainder when 15^21 is divided by 17, which can be written as:\n\n15^21 ≡ x (mod 17)\n\nFirst, let's find the remainder when 15 is divided by 17:\n\n15 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 15^2 is divided by 17:\n\n15^2 = 225 ≡ 4 (mod 17) (since 225 = 13 * 17 + 4)\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 15^4 is divided by 17:\n\n15^4 = (15^2)^2 ≡ 4^2 (mod 17) = 16 ≡ -1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 15^8 is divided by 17:\n\n15^8 = (15^4)^2 ≡ (-1)^2 (mod 17) = 1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 15^16 is divided by 17:\n\n15^16 = (15^8)^2 ≡ 1^2 (mod 17) = 1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 15^21 is divided by 17:\n\n15^21 = 15^(16+4+1) ≡ 15^16 * 15^4 * 15 (mod 17) ≡ 1 * (-1) * 15 (mod 17) ≡ -15 (mod 17)\n\nSince we want the positive remainder, we can add 17 to -15:\n\n-15 + 17 = 2\n\nSo, the remainder when 15^21 is divided by 17 is 2."
