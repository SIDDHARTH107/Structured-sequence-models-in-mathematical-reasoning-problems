    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. \n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A.\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nAs we can see, A △ B = B △ A = {1, 5}. Therefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection. The statement \"A△B ≠ B△A\" is incorrect, as we have shown that A△B = B△A."
