    "message_2": "To solve the rational equation (3x+1)/(x-2) = 2/3, we will first eliminate the denominators by cross-multiplying.\n\n(3x + 1) * 3 = (x - 2) * 2\n\nNow, distribute the numbers on both sides of the equation:\n\n9x + 3 = 2x - 4\n\nNext, we will isolate the variable x by moving all the x terms to one side and the constants to the other side:\n\n9x - 2x = -4 - 3\n\n7x = -7\n\nNow, divide by 7 to solve for x:\n\nx = -1\n\nSo, the solution to the rational equation is x = -1."
