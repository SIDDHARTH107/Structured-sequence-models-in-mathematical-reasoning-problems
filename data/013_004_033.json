Alex wants to watch the romantic movie, while Taylor wants to watch the comedy movie. They assign points to each movie as follows:\n\n- If they both choose the romantic movie, Alex gets 4 points and Taylor gets 3 points.\n- If they both choose the comedy movie, Alex gets 2 points and Taylor gets 2 points.\n- If Alex chooses the romantic movie and Taylor chooses the comedy movie, Alex gets 0 points and Taylor gets 1 point.\n- If Alex chooses the comedy movie and Taylor chooses the romantic movie, Alex gets 1 point and Taylor gets 0 points.\n\nWhat is the optimal decision for each friend and what is the outcome of their decision?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal decision for each friend, we can analyze the situation using a payoff matrix. The matrix will have the following structure:\n\n                      Taylor\n                     R       C\n                  R (4,3) (0,1)\n  Alex\n                  C (1,0) (2,2)\n\nWhere R represents the romantic movie and C represents the comedy movie. The numbers in the parentheses represent the points for Alex and Taylor, respectively.\n\nNow, let's analyze the matrix to find the optimal decision for each friend:\n\n1. If Alex chooses R and Taylor chooses R, the outcome is (4,3).\n2. If Alex chooses R and Taylor chooses C, the outcome is (0,1).\n3. If Alex chooses C and Taylor chooses R, the outcome is (1,0).\n4. If Alex chooses C and Taylor chooses C, the outcome is (2,2).\n\nFor Alex, the optimal decision is to choose R, as it gives him the maximum possible points (4) in one of the scenarios. For Taylor, the optimal decision is also to choose R, as it gives her the maximum possible points (3) in one of the scenarios.\n\nSo, the optimal decision for both friends is to choose the romantic movie (R). The outcome of their decision is that Alex gets 4 points and Taylor gets 3 points."
