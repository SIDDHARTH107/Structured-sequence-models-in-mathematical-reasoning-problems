    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given trigonometric function y = 4cos(3x + π/4) - 2, we need to analyze the function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a cosine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the cosine term. In this case, the amplitude is |4| = 4.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a cosine function is determined by the coefficient of the variable x inside the cosine term. The general formula for the period of a cosine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of x. In this case, B = 3. So, the period is (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3.\n\nThus, the amplitude of the function is 4 and the period is (2π) / 3."
