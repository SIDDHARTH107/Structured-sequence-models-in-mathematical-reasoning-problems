    "message_1": "A string of length 10 meters is fixed at both ends. At time t=0, the string is displaced from its equilibrium position such that its vertical displacement is given by y(x,0) = 0.1 sin(πx). Find the wave equation and determine the wave speed of a wave traveling on the string.",
    "message_2": "To find the wave equation, we first need to identify the form of the displacement function y(x, t). Since the string is fixed at both ends and initially displaced as y(x, 0) = 0.1 sin(πx), we can assume that the displacement function has the form:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(kx) cos(ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nAt time t = 0, we have:\n\ny(x, 0) = A sin(kx) cos(0) = A sin(kx)\n\nComparing this with the given initial displacement function, we can see that:\n\nA = 0.1\nk = π\n\nSo, the displacement function is:\n\ny(x, t) = 0.1 sin(πx) cos(ωt)\n\nNow, we need to find the wave speed. The wave equation for a string is given by:\n\n∂²y/∂t² = v² ∂²y/∂x²\n\nwhere v is the wave speed. Let's compute the second derivatives with respect to x and t:\n\n∂²y/∂x² = -0.1π² sin(πx) cos(ωt)\n∂²y/∂t² = -0.1ω² sin(πx) cos(ωt)\n\nNow, we can substitute these into the wave equation:\n\n-0.1ω² sin(πx) cos(ωt) = v² (-0.1π² sin(πx) cos(ωt))\n\nWe can cancel out the common factors:\n\nω² = v² π²\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between ω and k. For a wave on a string, the dispersion relation is given by:\n\nω = vk\n\nSubstituting k = π, we get:\n\nω = vπ\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nω² = v² π²\n\nComparing this with the previous equation, we can see that they are the same. Therefore, the wave speed v is:\n\nv = ω/π\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of ω and thus the wave speed v. We would need more information about the string's tension and mass density to find the wave speed."
