    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nIn a football game, the probability of a team winning is 0.4. If the team plays 20 games, what is the expected number of games they will win?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of games the team will win, you can simply multiply the probability of winning (0.4) by the total number of games played (20).\n\nExpected number of wins = Probability of winning × Total games played\nExpected number of wins = 0.4 × 20\nExpected number of wins = 8\n\nSo, the team is expected to win 8 games out of the 20 games they play."
