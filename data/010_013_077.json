    "message_2": "Let's first compute the Euler characteristic of the base surface $M$. For a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, the Euler characteristic is given by the formula:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2g\n\nNow, let's consider the Euler characteristic of the vector bundle $E$. The Euler characteristic of a vector bundle is the product of the Euler characteristic of the base space and the rank of the bundle:\n\nχ(E) = χ(M) × r\n\nSubstituting the expression for χ(M) into the equation, we get:\n\nχ(E) = (2 - 2g) × r\n\nSince the curvature of the bundle is constant and equal to -1, it does not affect the Euler characteristic. Therefore, the Euler characteristic of the vector bundle $E$ is:\n\nχ(E) = (2 - 2g) × r"
