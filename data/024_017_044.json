    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the velocity vector v along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve at any point t. The tangent vector is the derivative of the position vector r(t) with respect to t.\n\nr(t) = cos(t)i + sin(t)j + t^2k\n\nDifferentiating r(t) with respect to t, we get:\n\nr'(t) = -sin(t)i + cos(t)j + 2tk\n\nThis is the tangent vector T(t) of the curve. Now, we need to find the parallel transport of the given velocity vector v along the curve. The parallel transport of a vector is obtained by keeping the vector parallel to itself while moving it along the curve. This means that the change in the vector should be orthogonal to the tangent vector T(t) at each point.\n\nLet v(t) be the parallel transport of the velocity vector v along the curve. Then, the change in v(t) is given by its derivative with respect to t:\n\ndv(t)/dt\n\nWe want this change to be orthogonal to the tangent vector T(t). The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero, so we have:\n\n(dv(t)/dt) • T(t) = 0\n\nAt t=0, the velocity vector v = 2i + j + k. So, we have:\n\nv(0) = 2i + j + k\n\nNow, we need to solve the differential equation (dv(t)/dt) • T(t) = 0 with the initial condition v(0) = 2i + j + k to find the parallel transport v(t) of the velocity vector v along the curve.\n\nUnfortunately, this differential equation does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can use numerical methods (such as the Runge-Kutta method) to approximate the parallel transport v(t) of the velocity vector v along the curve for specific values of t."
