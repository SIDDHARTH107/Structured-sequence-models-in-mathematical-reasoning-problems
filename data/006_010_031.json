    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people affected by the disease, we can multiply the probability of a person being affected by the disease (0.035) by the total population of the city (500,000).\n\nExpected number of affected people = 0.035 * 500,000 = 17,500\n\nSo, we can expect 17,500 people to be affected by the disease in the city."
