    "message_2": "To compute the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as S_A = B^a mod p\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as S_B = A^b mod p\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. A = 3^5 mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 15\n2. B = 3^7 mod 17 = 2187 mod 17 = 6\n3. S_A = 6^5 mod 17 = 7776 mod 17 = 10\n4. S_B = 15^7 mod 17 = 170859375 mod 17 = 10\n\nThe shared secret key is 10. Alice and Bob will use this key for their message exchange."
