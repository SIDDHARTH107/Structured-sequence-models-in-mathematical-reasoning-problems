    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$, and let $v$ and $w$ be smooth vector fields on $M$. Consider the tensor field $T$ defined by $T(X,Y) = g(X,Y)v$ for any smooth vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $M$. Find the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to $w$.",
    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $w$, we will use the Leibniz rule for the covariant derivative of tensor fields. Let $\\nabla$ denote the Levi-Civita connection associated with the Riemannian metric $g$. Then, for any smooth vector fields $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ on $M$, we have:\n\n$(\\nabla_w T)(X,Y) = w(T(X,Y)) - T(\\nabla_w X, Y) - T(X, \\nabla_w Y)$.\n\nNow, we substitute the definition of $T$:\n\n$(\\nabla_w T)(X,Y) = w(g(X,Y)v) - g(\\nabla_w X, Y)v - g(X, \\nabla_w Y)v$.\n\nUsing the Leibniz rule for the covariant derivative of scalar fields and the product rule for the covariant derivative of vector fields, we get:\n\n$(\\nabla_w T)(X,Y) = (w(g(X,Y)))v + g(X,Y)(\\nabla_w v) - g(\\nabla_w X, Y)v - g(X, \\nabla_w Y)v$.\n\nNow, we use the properties of the Levi-Civita connection to rewrite the terms involving the covariant derivatives of $X$ and $Y$. Since the connection is torsion-free and metric-compatible, we have:\n\n$g(\\nabla_w X, Y) = w(g(X,Y)) - g(X, \\nabla_w Y)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $(\\nabla_w T)(X,Y)$, we get:\n\n$(\\nabla_w T)(X,Y) = (w(g(X,Y)))v + g(X,Y)(\\nabla_w v) - (w(g(X,Y)) - g(X, \\nabla_w Y))v - g(X, \\nabla_w Y)v$.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we find:\n\n$(\\nabla_w T)(X,Y) = g(X,Y)(\\nabla_w v)$.\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $w$ is given by:\n\n$(\\nabla_w T)(X,Y) = g(X,Y)(\\nabla_w v)$."
