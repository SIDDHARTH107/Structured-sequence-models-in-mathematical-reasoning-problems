    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of the matrix A using the power iteration method, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess x0 = [1 1 1]'\n2. Compute x1 = A * x0\n3. Normalize x1\n4. Compute x2 = A * x1\n5. Normalize x2\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until the relative error is less than 0.01\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\nx0 = [1 1 1]'\n\nx1 = A * x0 = \n[5 2 1; \n1 4 1; \n1 2 3] * [1 1 1]' = [8 6 6]'\n\nNormalize x1:\nx1_norm = x1 / ||x1|| = [8/12 6/12 6/12]' = [2/3 1/2 1/2]'\n\nx2 = A * x1_norm = \n[5 2 1; \n1 4 1; \n1 2 3] * [2/3 1/2 1/2]' = [4 2 2]'\n\nNormalize x2:\nx2_norm = x2 / ||x2|| = [4/6 2/6 2/6]' = [2/3 1/3 1/3]'\n\nNow, we need to check the relative error between x1_norm and x2_norm:\n\nrelative_error = ||x2_norm - x1_norm|| / ||x2_norm||\n\nrelative_error = ||[0 -1/6 -1/6]|| / ||[2/3 1/3 1/3]|| = sqrt((-1/6)^2 + (-1/6)^2) / sqrt((2/3)^2 + (1/3)^2 + (1/3)^2) = 1/3\n\nSince the relative error is not less than 0.01, we need to continue the iteration:\n\nx3 = A * x2_norm = \n[5 2 1; \n1 4 1; \n1 2 3] * [2/3 1/3 1/3]' = [4 2 2]'\n\nNormalize x3:\nx3_norm = x3 / ||x3|| = [4/6 2/6 2/6]' = [2/3 1/3 1/3]'\n\nThe relative error between x2_norm and x3_norm is 0, which is less than 0.01. Therefore, we can stop the iteration.\n\nThe dominant eigenvector is x3_norm = [2/3 1/3 1/3]'.\n\nTo find the dominant eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\ndominant_eigenvalue = (x3_norm' * A * x3_norm) / (x3_norm' * x3_norm)\n\ndominant_eigenvalue = ([2/3 1/3 1/3] * [5 2 1; 1 4 1; 1 2 3] * [2/3 1/3 1/3]') / ([2/3 1/3 1/3] * [2/3 1/3 1/3]')\n\ndominant_eigenvalue = (4) / (2/3) = 6\n\nThe dominant eigenvalue is 6.\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is 6 and the corresponding eigenvector is [2/3 1/3 1/3]'."
