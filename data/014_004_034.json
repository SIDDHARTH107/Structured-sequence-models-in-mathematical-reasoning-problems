    "message_2": "To find the sum P + Q on the elliptic curve E, we will use the formulas for adding points on an elliptic curve:\n\nIf P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2), then the sum R = P + Q = (x3, y3) can be computed as follows:\n\n1. If P = O (the point at infinity) or Q = O, then P + Q = P or Q, respectively.\n2. If x1 = x2 and y1 = -y2, then P + Q = O.\n3. If P ≠ Q, then the slope λ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) and x3 = λ² - x1 - x2, y3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1.\n4. If P = Q, then the slope λ = (3x1² + a) / 2y1 and x3 = λ² - 2x1, y3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1.\n\nIn our case, P = (2, 0) and Q = (1, 3), so P ≠ Q. We will use formula 3 to compute the sum:\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope λ. Since we are working in the field F₇, all calculations will be done modulo 7:\n\nλ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (3 - 0) / (1 - 2) = 3 / (-1) = 3 / 6 = 18 / 6 = 3 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates x3 and y3:\n\nx3 = λ² - x1 - x2 = 3² - 2 - 1 = 9 - 2 - 1 = 6 (mod 7)\n\ny3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1 = 3(2 - 6) - 0 = 3(-4) = 3(3) = 9 = 2 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the sum P + Q = (x3, y3) = (6, 2)."
