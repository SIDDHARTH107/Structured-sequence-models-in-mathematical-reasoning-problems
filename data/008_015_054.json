    "message_2": "First, we need to rewrite the system of equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  4  3 -1 |\n    |  3  9  2 |\n    | -1  2 10 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 13 |\n    | 35 |\n    | 34 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition states that a symmetric positive-definite matrix A can be decomposed into a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T such that A = L * L^T.\n\n1. Calculate L11:\nL11 = sqrt(A11) = sqrt(4) = 2\n\n2. Calculate L21 and L31:\nL21 = A21 / L11 = 3 / 2\nL31 = A31 / L11 = -1 / 2\n\n3. Calculate L22:\nL22 = sqrt(A22 - L21^2) = sqrt(9 - (3/2)^2) = sqrt(9 - 9/4) = sqrt(27/4) = 3/2\n\n4. Calculate L32:\nL32 = (A32 - L31 * L21) / L22 = (2 - (-1/2) * (3/2)) / (3/2) = (2 + 3/4) / (3/2) = 11/6\n\n5. Calculate L33:\nL33 = sqrt(A33 - L31^2 - L32^2) = sqrt(10 - (-1/2)^2 - (11/6)^2) = sqrt(10 - 1/4 - 121/36) = sqrt(35/36) = sqrt(35)/6\n\nNow we have the lower triangular matrix L:\n\nL = |  2    0    0  |\n    | 3/2  3/2   0  |\n    |-1/2 11/6 sqrt(35)/6 |\n\nNext, we will solve the system L * y = b for y using forward substitution:\n\n1. Solve for y1:\n2y1 = 13 => y1 = 13/2\n\n2. Solve for y2:\n(3/2)y2 + (3/2)(13/2) = 35 => y2 = 4\n\n3. Solve for y3:\n(-1/2)y3 + (11/6)(4) + (sqrt(35)/6)(13/2) = 34 => y3 = 3\n\nSo, y = | 13/2 |\n          |  4   |\n          |  3   |\n\nFinally, we will solve the system L^T * x = y for x using backward substitution:\n\n1. Solve for z:\n(2/sqrt(35))z + (11/3)(3) - (1/2)(13/2) = 3 => z = 2\n\n2. Solve for y:\n(3/2)y + (3/2)(2) = 4 => y = 1\n\n3. Solve for x:\n2x = 13/2 - (3/2) => x = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 3, y = 1, and z = 2."
