    "message_2": "Problem 1: Prove that f(z) is a constant function.\n\nSolution:\n\nLet f(z) be an entire function such that |f(z)| < 5 for all |z| > 1. We want to show that f(z) is a constant function.\n\nBy Liouville's theorem, if a function is entire and bounded, it must be constant. So, we need to show that f(z) is bounded.\n\nSince |f(z)| < 5 for all |z| > 1, we only need to show that f(z) is bounded in the region |z| ≤ 1. Since f(z) is entire, it is continuous and analytic in the closed disk |z| ≤ 1. This closed disk is a compact set, and a continuous function on a compact set is bounded. Therefore, there exists a constant M such that |f(z)| ≤ M for all |z| ≤ 1.\n\nNow, we can define a new constant N = max{5, M}. Then, |f(z)| ≤ N for all z in the complex plane. Since f(z) is entire and bounded, by Liouville's theorem, f(z) must be a constant function.\n\nProblem 2: Find all complex roots of the polynomial equation z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 4 = 0, by using the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root. In this case, we have a cubic polynomial equation, so it must have exactly three complex roots (counting multiplicities).\n\nLet's denote the roots as z1, z2, and z3. By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n\nz1 + z2 + z3 = -2\nz1*z2 + z1*z3 + z2*z3 = 3\nz1*z2*z3 = -4\n\nWe can use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method or Durand-Kerner method, to find the roots of the polynomial equation. Using these methods, we find the following roots:\n\nz1 ≈ -1.65063 - 0.817287i\nz2 ≈ -1.65063 + 0.817287i\nz3 ≈ 1.30127\n\nSo, the complex roots of the polynomial equation z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 4 = 0 are approximately z1 ≈ -1.65063 - 0.817287i, z2 ≈ -1.65063 + 0.817287i, and z3 ≈ 1.30127."
