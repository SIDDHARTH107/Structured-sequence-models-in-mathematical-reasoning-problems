    "message_2": "A Gosper curve is a fractal that increases in length with each iteration. At each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of (7/3). \n\nLet's calculate the total length of the fractal curve after the fourth iteration:\n\n1. First iteration: Side length = 4 units\n2. Second iteration: Side length = 4 * (7/3) = 28/3 units\n3. Third iteration: Side length = (28/3) * (7/3) = 196/9 units\n4. Fourth iteration: Side length = (196/9) * (7/3) = 1372/27 units\n\nSo, the total length of the fractal curve after the fourth iteration is 1372/27 units."
