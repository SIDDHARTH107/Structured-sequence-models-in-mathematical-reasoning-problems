    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = 2x - 1 on the interval [0, 2π] with a periodic discontinuity at x = π, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n for the sine and cosine terms.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity, and a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nSince the function has a periodic discontinuity at x = π, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[f(x)]dx from 0 to π + ∫[f(x)]dx from π to 2π]\n\nFor the interval [0, π], f(x) = 2x - 1:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[(2x - 1)]dx from 0 to π + ∫[f(x)]dx from π to 2π]\n\nNow, for the interval [π, 2π], since the function is periodic with a discontinuity at x = π, we can write f(x) as f(x) = 2(x - π) - 1:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[(2x - 1)]dx from 0 to π + ∫[(2(x - π) - 1)]dx from π to 2π]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(x^2 - x)| from 0 to π + ((x^2 - 2πx + π^2 - x)| from π to 2π)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(π^2 - π) + (4π^2 - 4π^2 + π^2 - π)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * (π^2 - π)\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_n and b_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nAgain, we need to split the integrals into two parts due to the periodic discontinuity at x = π:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[(2x - 1) * cos(n * x)]dx from 0 to π + ∫[(2(x - π) - 1) * cos(n * x)]dx from π to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[(2x - 1) * sin(n * x)]dx from 0 to π + ∫[(2(x - π) - 1) * sin(n * x)]dx from π to 2π]\n\nNow, we can integrate by parts:\n\nFor a_n:\n\nLet u = 2x - 1, dv = cos(n * x)dx\ndu = 2dx, v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nFor b_n:\n\nLet u = 2x - 1, dv = sin(n * x)dx\ndu = 2dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(u * v)| from 0 to π + (u * v)| from π to 2π - ∫[v * du] from 0 to 2π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [((2x - 1) * (1/n) * sin(n * x))| from 0 to π + ((2(x - π) - 1) * (1/n) * sin(n * x))| from π to 2π - (1/n) * ∫[sin(n * x) * 2]dx from 0 to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(u * v)| from 0 to π + (u * v)| from π to 2π - ∫[v * du] from 0 to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [((2x - 1) * (-1/n) * cos(n * x))| from 0 to π + ((2(x - π) - 1) * (-1/n) * cos(n * x))| from π to 2π + (1/n) * ∫[cos(n * x) * 2]dx from 0 to 2π]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integrals and simplify the expressions for a_n and b_n.\n\nFinally, we can write the Fourier series for the given function:\n\nf(x) = (π^2 - π)/π + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]"
