    "message_2": "Since $E$ has a trivial subbundle of rank 2, we can write $E$ as a direct sum of two vector bundles: $E = F \\oplus G$, where $F$ is the trivial subbundle of rank 2 and $G$ is a vector bundle of rank 1. In other words, $F$ is isomorphic to the product bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $G$ is isomorphic to the product bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler class $e(E)$ using the Whitney sum formula for the Euler class, which states that $e(E) = e(F) \\smile e(G)$, where $\\smile$ denotes the cup product in cohomology.\n\nSince $F$ is a trivial bundle of rank 2, its Euler class is zero: $e(F) = 0$. This is because the Euler class is a topological invariant that measures the twisting of a vector bundle, and a trivial bundle has no twisting.\n\nNow, since the cup product with a zero class is always zero, we have $e(E) = e(F) \\smile e(G) = 0 \\smile e(G) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the Euler class of $E$ is zero: $e(E) = 0$."
