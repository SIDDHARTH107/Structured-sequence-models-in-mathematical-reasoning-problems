The given differential equation is:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -5y$\n\nFirst, rewrite the equation in the standard form:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} + 5y = 0$\n\nNow, we can find the integrating factor (IF) by calculating the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y:\n\n$IF = e^{\\int 5 dx} = e^{5x}$\n\nNext, multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor:\n\n$e^{5x} \\frac{dy}{dx} + 5e^{5x} y = 0$\n\nThe left side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{5x}) = 0$\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n$\\int \\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{5x}) dx = \\int 0 dx$\n\n$ye^{5x} = C$\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n$y = Ce^{-5x}$\n\nTo find the particular solution, we use the initial condition $y(0) = 2$:\n\n$2 = Ce^{-5(0)}$\n\n$2 = C$\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\n$y(x) = 2e^{-5x}$"
