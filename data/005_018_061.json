The survival times (in months) of these patients after surgery are as follows:\n- 10 patients survived for less than 6 months\n- 20 patients survived between 6 and 12 months\n- 30 patients survived between 12 and 24 months\n- 15 patients survived between 24 and 36 months\n- 10 patients survived for more than 36 months\n\nWhat is the estimated survival function of the patients who undergo the surgical procedure?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the survival function, we can use the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is given by the formula:\n\nS(t) = Π(1 - d_i / n_i)\n\nwhere S(t) is the survival probability at time t, d_i is the number of events (deaths) at time t_i, and n_i is the number of individuals at risk at time t_i.\n\nWe can calculate the survival function for each time interval as follows:\n\n1. Less than 6 months:\n- d_1 = 10 (10 patients died)\n- n_1 = 100 (100 patients at risk)\n- S(6) = (1 - 10/100) = 0.9\n\n2. Between 6 and 12 months:\n- d_2 = 20 (20 patients died)\n- n_2 = 90 (100 - 10 = 90 patients at risk)\n- S(12) = S(6) * (1 - 20/90) = 0.9 * (1 - 20/90) = 0.9 * (70/90) = 0.7\n\n3. Between 12 and 24 months:\n- d_3 = 30 (30 patients died)\n- n_3 = 70 (90 - 20 = 70 patients at risk)\n- S(24) = S(12) * (1 - 30/70) = 0.7 * (1 - 30/70) = 0.7 * (40/70) = 0.4\n\n4. Between 24 and 36 months:\n- d_4 = 15 (15 patients died)\n- n_4 = 40 (70 - 30 = 40 patients at risk)\n- S(36) = S(24) * (1 - 15/40) = 0.4 * (1 - 15/40) = 0.4 * (25/40) = 0.25\n\n5. More than 36 months:\n- d_5 = 10 (10 patients died)\n- n_5 = 25 (40 - 15 = 25 patients at risk)\n- S(>36) = S(36) * (1 - 10/25) = 0.25 * (1 - 10/25) = 0.25 * (15/25) = 0.15\n\nSo, the estimated survival function is:\n- S(t) = 0.9 for t < 6 months\n- S(t) = 0.7 for 6 ≤ t < 12 months\n- S(t) = 0.4 for 12 ≤ t < 24 months\n- S(t) = 0.25 for 24 ≤ t < 36 months\n- S(t) = 0.15 for t > 36 months"
