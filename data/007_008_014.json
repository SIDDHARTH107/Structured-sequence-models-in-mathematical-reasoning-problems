    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the last digit of $7^{129}$, which means we are looking for the remainder when divided by 10. Since 10 is not a prime number, we can't directly apply Fermat's Little Theorem. However, we can use the theorem for the prime factors of 10, which are 2 and 5.\n\nFirst, let's apply Fermat's Little Theorem for the prime number 5:\n$7^{5-1} \\equiv 7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n\nNow, let's find the remainder of $7^{129}$ when divided by 5:\n$7^{129} \\equiv (7^4)^{32} \\times 7 \\equiv 1^{32} \\times 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{5}$\n\nNext, let's apply Fermat's Little Theorem for the prime number 2:\n$7^{2-1} \\equiv 7^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$\n\nNow, let's find the remainder of $7^{129}$ when divided by 2:\n$7^{129} \\equiv (7^1)^{129} \\equiv 1^{129} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$\n\nNow, we have the remainders when divided by 2 and 5:\n$7^{129} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$\n$7^{129} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{5}$\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the remainder when divided by 10. The theorem states that if we have a system of linear congruences:\n\n$x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{m_1}$\n$x \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{m_2}$\n\nwhere $m_1$ and $m_2$ are coprime, then there exists a unique solution modulo $m_1m_2$.\n\nIn our case, $a_1 = 1$, $m_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 7$, and $m_2 = 5$. Since 2 and 5 are coprime, we can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nLet's find the solution:\n$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$\n$x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{5}$\n\nWe can rewrite the first congruence as:\n$x = 1 + 2k_1$\n\nSubstitute this into the second congruence:\n$1 + 2k_1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{5}$\n\nSimplifying the congruence, we get:\n$2k_1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{5}$\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (since 2 is invertible modulo 5):\n$k_1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$\n\nSo, $k_1 = 3 + 5k_2$ for some integer $k_2$. Now we can find the value of x:\n$x = 1 + 2k_1 = 1 + 2(3 + 5k_2) = 7 + 10k_2$\n\nThus, $x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10}$, which means the last digit of $7^{129}$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
