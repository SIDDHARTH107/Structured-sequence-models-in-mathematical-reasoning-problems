    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the integral of the Gaussian curvature over a surface to the Euler characteristic of that surface. For a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2. The theorem states:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, dA is the area element, and χ is the Euler characteristic.\n\nFor a sphere of radius r, the Gaussian curvature is given by:\n\nK = 1/r^2\n\nIn our case, the radius r is 5 cm. So, the Gaussian curvature K is:\n\nK = 1/(5^2) = 1/25\n\nNow, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface of the sphere:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n∫∫_S (1/25) dA = 2π(2)\n\nTo solve for the integral, we can multiply both sides by 25:\n\n∫∫_S dA = 50π\n\nThe left side of the equation represents the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface of the sphere. Therefore, the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface of the sphere with radius 5 cm is 50π."
