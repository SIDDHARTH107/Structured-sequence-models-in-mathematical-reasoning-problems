    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 32 is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C32, D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32, we will use the Sylow theorems and the structure of p-groups.\n\nFirst, note that 32 = 2^5, so G is a group of order p^5, where p = 2. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 2 and divides 1 (since 32 is a power of 2). Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G, which we will denote by P.\n\nSince P is the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G, it is normal in G. Now, we will analyze the structure of P. Since P is a group of order 2^5, it is a p-group, and by the structure theorem for p-groups, we know that P has a non-trivial center, i.e., |Z(P)| > 1. The possible orders for Z(P) are 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.\n\nCase 1: |Z(P)| = 32\nIn this case, P is abelian and isomorphic to C32. Since P is normal in G and G has order 32, G is isomorphic to C32.\n\nCase 2: |Z(P)| = 16\nIn this case, P is an extension of Z(P) by a group of order 2. Since Z(P) is abelian, P is also abelian and isomorphic to C16 × C2. Since P is normal in G and G has order 32, G is isomorphic to C16 × C2.\n\nCase 3: |Z(P)| = 8\nIn this case, P is an extension of Z(P) by a group of order 4. Since Z(P) is abelian, P is either abelian and isomorphic to C8 × C4 or non-abelian and isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. If P is abelian, then G is isomorphic to C8 × C4. If P is non-abelian, then G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nCase 4: |Z(P)| = 4\nIn this case, P is an extension of Z(P) by a group of order 8. Since Z(P) is abelian, P is either abelian and isomorphic to C4 × C8 or non-abelian and isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. If P is abelian, then G is isomorphic to C4 × C8. If P is non-abelian, then G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nCase 5: |Z(P)| = 2\nIn this case, P is an extension of Z(P) by a group of order 16. Since Z(P) is abelian, P is either abelian and isomorphic to C2 × C16 or non-abelian and isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. If P is abelian, then G is isomorphic to C2 × C16. If P is non-abelian, then G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nIn summary, a group G of order 32 is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C32, D16 (which is isomorphic to C16 × C2), or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32."
