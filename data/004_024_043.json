    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nGiven the equation: 2x^3 + y^2 = x^2y\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(2x^3) + d/dx(y^2) = d/dx(x^2y)\n\nUsing the chain rule for d/dx(y^2) and d/dx(x^2y):\n\n6x^2 + 2y(dy/dx) = 2xy(dy/dx) + x^2(dy/dx)\n\nNow, we want to solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) - 2xy(dy/dx) - x^2(dy/dx) = 6x^2\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx(2y - 2xy - x^2) = 6x^2\n\nNow, divide both sides by (2y - 2xy - x^2) to get dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = 6x^2 / (2y - 2xy - x^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 1. We can do this by plugging x = 1 back into the original equation:\n\n2(1)^3 + y^2 = (1)^2y\n2 + y^2 = y\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for y:\n\ny^2 - y + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, but it does not have real roots. Therefore, there is no real value of y when x = 1, and we cannot find the derivative of y with respect to x at this point."
