    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus. The Euler's formula for planar graphs is:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a graph embedded on a surface of genus g, the formula is generalized as:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nSince we know the graph has 12 vertices (V = 12) and 18 edges (E = 18), we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nF = 2 - 2g + 18 - 12\n\nF = 8 - 2g\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of faces (F) that the graph can have when embedded on a torus. A torus has a genus of 1, so we can plug g = 1 into the formula:\n\nF = 8 - 2(1)\n\nF = 6\n\nSince the graph can be embedded on a torus, it must have at least 6 faces. Now we can use the inequality for the number of edges in a graph embedded on a surface of genus g:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for V, E, and g:\n\n18 ≤ 3(12) + 6(1) - 6\n\n18 ≤ 36 + 6 - 6\n\n18 ≤ 36\n\nSince the inequality holds true, the graph can indeed be embedded on a torus, and its genus is 1."
