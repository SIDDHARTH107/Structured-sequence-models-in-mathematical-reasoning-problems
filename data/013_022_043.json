    "message_1": "Suppose two players are playing the Dictator Game, and Player 1 is given a sum of $100 to split between themselves and Player 2. Player 2 has no say in the decision and must accept whatever amount is given to them. What is the optimal amount that Player 1 should give to Player 2 to maximize their own utility?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the optimal amount that Player 1 should give to Player 2 to maximize their own utility depends on Player 1's preferences and values. If Player 1 is purely self-interested, they would give $0 to Player 2 and keep the entire $100 for themselves, as this maximizes their own monetary gain.\n\nHowever, if Player 1 values fairness, altruism, or is concerned about their reputation, they might choose to give a different amount to Player 2. For example, they might decide to split the money evenly, giving $50 to Player 2 and keeping $50 for themselves. In this case, Player 1's utility is maximized by balancing their own monetary gain with their desire for fairness or altruism.\n\nUltimately, the optimal amount that Player 1 should give to Player 2 depends on Player 1's individual preferences and values."
