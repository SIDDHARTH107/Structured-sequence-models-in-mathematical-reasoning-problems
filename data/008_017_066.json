    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate z from the first and second equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 1, so that the coefficients of z in both equations are the same:\n\n(2x + 3y - z) * 6 = 5 * 6\n(3x - 4y + 6z) * 1 = -2 * 1\n\nWhich results in:\n\n12x + 18y - 6z = 30\n3x - 4y + 6z = -2\n\nNow, we can add these two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(12x + 18y - 6z) + (3x - 4y + 6z) = 30 + (-2)\n15x + 14y = 28 (1)\n\nNext, we will eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 7 and the third equation by 1, so that the coefficients of z in both equations are the same:\n\n(2x + 3y - z) * 7 = 5 * 7\n(5x + 8y - 7z) * 1 = 10 * 1\n\nWhich results in:\n\n14x + 21y - 7z = 35\n5x + 8y - 7z = 10\n\nNow, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate z:\n\n(14x + 21y - 7z) - (5x + 8y - 7z) = 35 - 10\n9x + 13y = 25 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n15x + 14y = 28 (1)\n9x + 13y = 25 (2)\n\nTo eliminate y, we will multiply the first equation by 13 and the second equation by 14:\n\n(15x + 14y) * 13 = 28 * 13\n(9x + 13y) * 14 = 25 * 14\n\nWhich results in:\n\n195x + 182y = 364\n126x + 182y = 350\n\nNow, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y:\n\n(195x + 182y) - (126x + 182y) = 364 - 350\n69x = 14\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 14 / 69\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into equations (1) and (2) to find the value of y:\n\n15(14/69) + 14y = 28\n9(14/69) + 13y = 25\n\nWhich results in:\n\n210/69 + 14y = 28\n126/69 + 13y = 25\n\nNow, we can solve for y in both equations:\n\n14y = 28 - 210/69\n13y = 25 - 126/69\n\n14y = (1938 - 210) / 69\n13y = (1725 - 126) / 69\n\n14y = 1728 / 69\n13y = 1599 / 69\n\ny = 1728 / (14 * 69)\ny = 1599 / (13 * 69)\n\ny = 123 / 69\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can substitute them back into the first equation to find the value of z:\n\n2(14/69) + 3(123/69) - z = 5\n\nWhich results in:\n\n28/69 + 369/69 - z = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\n397/69 - z = 5\n\nz = 397/69 - 5\n\nz = (397 - 345) / 69\n\nz = 52 / 69\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n(x, y, z) = (14/69, 123/69, 52/69)"
