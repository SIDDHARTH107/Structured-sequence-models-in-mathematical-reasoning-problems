Consider the following 5-vertex complete graph with edges colored red and blue:\n\n1. Connect vertices 1, 2, and 3 with red edges.\n2. Connect vertices 4 and 5 with red edges.\n3. Connect the remaining edges with blue edges.\n\nIn this graph, there is no monochromatic triangle. Therefore, R(3,3) cannot be 5.\n\nSince R(3,3) ≤ 6 and R(3,3) > 5, we conclude that R(3,3) = 6."
