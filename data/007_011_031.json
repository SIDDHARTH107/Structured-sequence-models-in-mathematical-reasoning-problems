    "message_2": "A quadratic residue modulo n is an integer that is congruent to a perfect square modulo n. In other words, if there exists an integer x such that x^2 ≡ a (mod n), then a is a quadratic residue modulo n.\n\nTo find the quadratic residues modulo 10, we can test all integers from 0 to 9 (as they are the possible remainders when dividing by 10) and check if there exists an integer x such that x^2 ≡ a (mod 10).\n\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 10)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 10)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 10)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 10)\n4^2 ≡ 6 (mod 10)\n5^2 ≡ 5 (mod 10)\n6^2 ≡ 6 (mod 10)\n7^2 ≡ 9 (mod 10)\n8^2 ≡ 4 (mod 10)\n9^2 ≡ 1 (mod 10)\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the quadratic residues modulo 10 are {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}."
