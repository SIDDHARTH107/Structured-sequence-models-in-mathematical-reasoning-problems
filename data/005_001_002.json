    "message_1": "A coffee company claims that their new blend of coffee has a mean caffeine content of 100 milligrams per cup. To test this claim, a sample of 36 cups of coffee is taken and the caffeine content is measured for each cup. It was found that the sample mean is 95 milligrams per cup with a sample standard deviation of 12 milligrams per cup. \n\nDetermine whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude, at the 5% significance level, that the mean caffeine content of the new blend of coffee is different from 100 milligrams per cup.",
    "message_2": "To test this claim, we will perform a hypothesis test using the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 100 milligrams per cup (the mean caffeine content is 100 milligrams per cup)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 100 milligrams per cup (the mean caffeine content is different from 100 milligrams per cup)\n\nWe will use a t-test since the population standard deviation is unknown. The test statistic is given by:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nt = (95 - 100) / (12 / √36) = -5 / 2 = -2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the critical value for a two-tailed t-test at the 5% significance level with 36 - 1 = 35 degrees of freedom. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the critical values are approximately ±2.03.\n\nSince our test statistic t = -2.5 falls in the rejection region (t < -2.03), we reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that the mean caffeine content of the new blend of coffee is different from 100 milligrams per cup."
