    "message_2": "To find the Riemann-Roch space of the curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + x^2$ and the divisor $D = 3P - 2Q$, where $P = (-1, 0)$ and $Q = (0,0)$, we will first compute the genus $g$ of the curve, and then use the Riemann-Roch theorem to find the dimension of the space $L(D)$.\n\nThe curve is a plane curve of degree $3$, so by the genus-degree formula, we have:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1$$\n\nNow, let's compute the canonical divisor $K$. Since the curve is given by the equation $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x^2 = 0$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 2x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$$\n\nThe canonical divisor $K$ is given by the zeros of the differential form $\\omega = \\frac{dx}{\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}} = \\frac{dx}{2y}$, which are the points where $y = 0$. In this case, we have:\n\n$$x^3 + x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2(x+1) = 0$$\n\nSo the canonical divisor is $K = 2(0,0) + 2(-1,0) = 2Q + 2P$.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem, which states that for any divisor $D$ on a curve of genus $g$:\n\n$$l(D) - l(K - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$$\n\nIn our case, $D = 3P - 2Q$, so $K - D = (2Q + 2P) - (3P - 2Q) = 4Q - P$. We have:\n\n$$l(3P - 2Q) - l(4Q - P) = \\deg(3P - 2Q) + 1 - 1$$\n\nSince $\\deg(3P - 2Q) = 3 - 2 = 1$, we get:\n\n$$l(3P - 2Q) - l(4Q - P) = 1$$\n\nNow we need to find the dimensions of the spaces $L(3P - 2Q)$ and $L(4Q - P)$. \n\nFor $L(3P - 2Q)$, we are looking for functions $f(x, y)$ such that $(\\operatorname{div}(f) + 3P - 2Q) \\ge 0$. Since $3P - 2Q$ has degree $1$, we can only consider functions of the form $f(x, y) = ax + by + c$. The condition $(\\operatorname{div}(f) + 3P - 2Q) \\ge 0$ implies that $f$ must have a zero of order at least $3$ at $P$ and a pole of order at least $2$ at $Q$. However, this is not possible for a linear function, so $l(3P - 2Q) = 0$.\n\nFor $L(4Q - P)$, we are looking for functions $f(x, y)$ such that $(\\operatorname{div}(f) + 4Q - P) \\ge 0$. Since $4Q - P$ has degree $3$, we can consider functions of the form $f(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f$. The condition $(\\operatorname{div}(f) + 4Q - P) \\ge 0$ implies that $f$ must have a zero of order at least $4$ at $Q$ and a pole of order at least $1$ at $P$. This is possible for a quadratic function, so $l(4Q - P) \\ge 1$.\n\nNow we can solve the Riemann-Roch equation:\n\n$$l(3P - 2Q) - l(4Q - P) = 1 \\Rightarrow 0 - l(4Q - P) = 1$$\n\nSince $l(4Q - P) \\ge 1$, we must have $l(4Q - P) = 1$. Therefore, the Riemann-Roch space $L(3P - 2Q)$ is trivial (i.e., it contains only the zero function), and the Riemann-Roch space $L(4Q - P)$ has dimension $1$."
