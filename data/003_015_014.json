    "message_2": "To determine the period and amplitude of the sinusoidal wave represented by the equation y = 4 sin(3x - π/4), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal wave, which is y = A sin(Bx - C).\n\nIn our given equation, y = 4 sin(3x - π/4), we can identify the following:\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the coefficient of the sine function, which determines the maximum value of the wave. In this case, the amplitude is 4.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sinusoidal wave is the length of one complete cycle of the wave. To find the period, we need to look at the coefficient of x inside the sine function, which is B. In this case, B = 3. The period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nSubstituting the value of B into the formula, we get:\n\nPeriod = 2π / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the wave is 4, and the period of the wave is 2π/3."
