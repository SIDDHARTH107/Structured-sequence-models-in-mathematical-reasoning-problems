    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using Fourier Analysis, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the input signal and analyze its frequency response. The given differential equation is:\n\ndy/dt + 2y = 6cos(3t)\n\nLet's first find the Fourier transform of the input signal, which is 6cos(3t). The Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF{cos(at)} = (1/2) * [δ(ω - a) + δ(ω + a)]\n\nwhere F denotes the Fourier transform, ω is the angular frequency, and δ is the Dirac delta function. In our case, a = 3, so the Fourier transform of the input signal is:\n\nF{6cos(3t)} = 3 * [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]\n\nNow, let's find the transfer function of the system. The transfer function is the ratio of the output signal's Fourier transform to the input signal's Fourier transform. For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by a differential equation, the transfer function can be found by replacing the time derivatives with their corresponding frequency-domain expressions. In our case, dy/dt is replaced by jωY(ω), where Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of the output signal y(t). So, the given differential equation in the frequency domain becomes:\n\njωY(ω) + 2Y(ω) = 3 * [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) as:\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / X(ω) = 1 / (2 + jω)\n\nTo analyze the stability of the system, we need to look at the frequency response of the system, which is given by the magnitude of the transfer function:\n\n|H(ω)| = |1 / (2 + jω)|\n\nThe system is stable if the magnitude of the transfer function is bounded for all frequencies. In our case, as ω approaches infinity, the magnitude of the transfer function approaches zero:\n\nlim (ω→∞) |1 / (2 + jω)| = 0\n\nThis indicates that the system is stable, as the magnitude of the transfer function is bounded for all frequencies."
