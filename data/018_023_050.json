    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 3} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and A, denoted as (A △ B) × A.\n\n(A △ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of sets B and A, denoted as B △ A.\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4} (union of B and A)\nB ∩ A = {2, 3} (intersection of B and A)\n\nB △ A = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (B △ A) and A, denoted as (B △ A) × A.\n\n(B △ A) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nWe can see that (A △ B) × A = (B △ A) × A, which means the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to the Cartesian product.\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is associative with respect to the Cartesian product. Let C = {3, 4, 5}. We need to check if ((A △ B) △ C) × A = (A △ (B △ C)) × A.\n\nFirst, let's find A △ B and B △ C:\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\nB △ C = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ C and A △ (B △ C):\n\n(A △ B) △ C = {1, 4} △ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 3, 5}\nA △ (B △ C) = {1, 2, 3} △ {1, 2, 5} = {3, 5}\n\nWe can see that (A △ B) △ C = A △ (B △ C). Now let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n((A △ B) △ C) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n(A △ (B △ C)) × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nWe can see that ((A △ B) △ C) × A ≠ (A △ (B △ C)) × A. Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
