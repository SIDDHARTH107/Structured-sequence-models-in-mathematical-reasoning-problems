    "message_2": "The probability that a company will experience financial fraud in a given year can be calculated using the historical data provided. \n\nNumber of companies that experience fraud = 10\nTotal number of companies = 100\n\nProbability of a company experiencing financial fraud in a given year = (Number of companies that experience fraud) / (Total number of companies) = 10 / 100 = 1 / 10 = 0.1\n\nSo, the probability is 0.1 or 10%."
