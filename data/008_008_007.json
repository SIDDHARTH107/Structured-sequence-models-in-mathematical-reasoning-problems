    "message_1": "A company produces two products, product A and product B, which require two types of machine hours – MH1 and MH2. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of MH1 and 1 hour of MH2, while each unit of product B requires 1 hour of MH1 and 3 hours of MH2. The company has 60 hours of MH1 available each day and 35 hours of MH2 available each day. The profit margin for each unit of product A is $8 and $10 for product B. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the machine hours are:\n\n2x + y ≤ 60 (MH1 constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 35 (MH2 constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 8x + 10y\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 60\ny ≤ -2x + 60\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 35\ny ≤ -(1/3)x + 35/3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. The corner points of the feasible region are:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 35/3)\nC(15, 30)\nD(30, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n\nP(A) = 8(0) + 10(0) = $0\nP(B) = 8(0) + 10(35/3) = $350/3 ≈ $116.67\nP(C) = 8(15) + 10(30) = $420\nP(D) = 8(30) + 10(0) = $240\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, where the company produces 15 units of product A and 30 units of product B. The maximum profit is $420."
