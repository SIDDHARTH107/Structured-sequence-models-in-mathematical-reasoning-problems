    "message_2": "Let P(x, y) be a point on the locus. Since P is equidistant from the points (4, 2) and (-2, 6), the distance between P and (4, 2) is equal to the distance between P and (-2, 6).\n\nUsing the distance formula, we have:\n\n√((x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2) = √((x + 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2)\n\nNow, square both sides to get rid of the square roots:\n\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = (x + 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2\n\nExpand the squares:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = x^2 + 4x + 4 + y^2 - 12y + 36\n\nNow, simplify the equation by canceling out the x^2 and y^2 terms and moving all other terms to one side:\n\n-8x - 4x - 4y + 12y = 16 - 4 - 36\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-12x + 8y = -24\n\nNow, divide by -4 to simplify the equation:\n\n3x - 2y = 6\n\nSo, the equation of the locus of points equidistant from the points (4, 2) and (-2, 6) is:\n\n3x - 2y = 6"
