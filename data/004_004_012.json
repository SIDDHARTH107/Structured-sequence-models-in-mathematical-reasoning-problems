    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 3x² + 2x + 1 within the interval [0, 2], we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 0 to 2.\n\n∫(3x² + 2x + 1) dx from 0 to 2\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative of 3x² is x³ (3/3 = 1)\nAntiderivative of 2x is x² (2/2 = 1)\nAntiderivative of 1 is x\n\nSo, the antiderivative is: x³ + x² + x\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of the interval and subtract:\n\n(x³ + x² + x) | from 0 to 2\n\n= (2³ + 2² + 2) - (0³ + 0² + 0)\n= (8 + 4 + 2) - 0\n= 14\n\nThe area under the curve y = 3x² + 2x + 1 within the interval [0, 2] is 14 square units."
