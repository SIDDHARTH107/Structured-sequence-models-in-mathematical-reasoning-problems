    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of a vector along a curve, we need to solve the following differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{Dv}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\alpha'(t)}v = 0$\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector $\\alpha'(t)$ by differentiating the curve $\\alpha(t)$ component-wise:\n\n$\\alpha'(t) = \\frac{d\\alpha}{dt} = (2t, 1, 3t^2)$\n\nNow, let's denote the parallel transported vector as $v(t) = (v_1(t), v_2(t), v_3(t))$. We need to find the covariant derivative of $v(t)$ along the curve $\\alpha(t)$:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\alpha'(t)}v = \\left(\\frac{dv_1}{dt} + \\Gamma^1_{11}v_1 + \\Gamma^1_{12}v_2 + \\Gamma^1_{13}v_3, \\frac{dv_2}{dt} + \\Gamma^2_{21}v_1 + \\Gamma^2_{22}v_2 + \\Gamma^2_{23}v_3, \\frac{dv_3}{dt} + \\Gamma^3_{31}v_1 + \\Gamma^3_{32}v_2 + \\Gamma^3_{33}v_3\\right)$\n\nHere, $\\Gamma^i_{jk}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind. However, since we are working in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, all the Christoffel symbols are zero. Thus, the covariant derivative simplifies to:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\alpha'(t)}v = \\left(\\frac{dv_1}{dt}, \\frac{dv_2}{dt}, \\frac{dv_3}{dt}\\right)$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n$\\frac{dv_1}{dt} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{dv_2}{dt} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{dv_3}{dt} = 0$\n\nwith the initial conditions $v(0) = (1, 2, 3)$.\n\nThe solutions to these ODEs are:\n\n$v_1(t) = 1$\n\n$v_2(t) = 2$\n\n$v_3(t) = 3$\n\nThus, the parallel transported vector $v(t)$ along the curve $\\alpha(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=1$ is:\n\n$v(1) = (1, 2, 3)$\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector $v$ along the curve $\\alpha(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=1$ is the same vector $(1, 2, 3)$."
