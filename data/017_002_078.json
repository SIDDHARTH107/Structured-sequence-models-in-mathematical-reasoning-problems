    "message_2": "Let g be a generator of G. Since G is a cyclic group of order 20, we have g^20 = e (the identity element), and the order of g is 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H of order 4. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G, which is true since 4 divides 20. To find a generator of H, we need to find an element h in H such that its order is 4.\n\nSince the order of g is 20, we can find an element of order 4 by raising g to the power of 20/4 = 5. So, let h = g^5. Now, let's check the order of h:\n\nh^1 = g^5\nh^2 = (g^5)^2 = g^10\nh^3 = (g^5)^3 = g^15\nh^4 = (g^5)^4 = g^20 = e\n\nSince h^4 = e and h^k â‰  e for k < 4, the order of h is 4. Therefore, h = g^5 is a generator of the subgroup H of order 4."
