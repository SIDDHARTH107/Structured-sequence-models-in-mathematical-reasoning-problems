    "message_2": "1. The initial current through the circuit, I(0):\n\nWhen the input voltage is applied as a step function, the initial current through the circuit can be calculated using Ohm's Law:\n\nI(0) = V(0) / R\nI(0) = 20 V / 200 Ω\nI(0) = 0.1 A\n\n2. The steady-state current through the circuit, I∞:\n\nIn steady-state, the inductor acts as a short circuit and the capacitor acts as an open circuit. Therefore, the current through the capacitor is zero, and the steady-state current is the same as the initial current:\n\nI∞ = I(0) = 0.1 A\n\n3. The time constant of the circuit:\n\nThe time constant of an RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nτ = 2L / R\nτ = 2 * 0.15 H / 200 Ω\nτ = 0.0015 s\n\n4. The natural frequency of the circuit:\n\nThe natural frequency (ω₀) of an RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nω₀ = 1 / √(LC)\nω₀ = 1 / √(0.15 H * 4.7 μF)\nω₀ = 1 / √(0.15 H * 4.7 * 10^(-6) F)\nω₀ ≈ 180.6 rad/s\n\n5. The complete expression for the current as a function of time, I(t):\n\nThe current in an RLC circuit with a step input voltage can be expressed as:\n\nI(t) = I∞ + (I(0) - I∞) * e^(-t/τ) * cos(ω₀t + φ)\n\nIn this case, I(0) = I∞ = 0.1 A, τ = 0.0015 s, and ω₀ ≈ 180.6 rad/s. To find the phase angle φ, we can use the formula:\n\nφ = arctan(-ω₀τ)\n\nφ = arctan(-180.6 * 0.0015)\nφ ≈ -1.57 rad\n\nNow, we can plug in the values to get the complete expression for the current as a function of time:\n\nI(t) = 0.1 + (0.1 - 0.1) * e^(-t/0.0015) * cos(180.6t - 1.57) A\nI(t) = 0.1 * e^(-t/0.0015) * cos(180.6t - 1.57) A"
