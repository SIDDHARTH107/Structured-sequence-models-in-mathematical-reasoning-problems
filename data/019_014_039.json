    "message_1": "Let X be a set of 4 elements. How many subsets of X can we form using higher-order logic?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of subsets of a set X with 4 elements, we can use the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set. In this case, n = 4.\n\n2^4 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 possible subsets of X, including the empty set and the set X itself. This result is independent of the type of logic used, as it is a fundamental property of sets."
