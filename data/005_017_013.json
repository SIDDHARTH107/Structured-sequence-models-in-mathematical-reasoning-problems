The covariance matrix for the dataset is:\n\n|   | X1 | X2 | X3 | X4 | X5 |\n| - | -  | -  | -  | -  | -  |\n| X1 | 6  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n| X2 | 1  | 7  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n| X3 | 0  | 0  | 3  | 2  | 0  |\n| X4 | 0  | 0  | 2  | 5  | 0  |\n| X5 | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n\nUsing principal component analysis, determine the first two principal components and the proportion of variation explained by each component.",
    "message_2": "To perform principal component analysis (PCA), we first need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variation explained by each component.\n\nCovariance matrix:\n\n|   | X1 | X2 | X3 | X4 | X5 |\n| - | -  | -  | -  | -  | -  |\n| X1 | 6  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n| X2 | 1  | 7  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n| X3 | 0  | 0  | 3  | 2  | 0  |\n| X4 | 0  | 0  | 2  | 5  | 0  |\n| X5 | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix:\n\nλ1 = 8.246, v1 = [0.273, 0.957, 0.000, 0.000, 0.091]\nλ2 = 5.754, v2 = [0.000, 0.000, 0.707, 0.707, 0.000]\nλ3 = 3.000, v3 = [0.000, 0.000, 0.707, -0.707, 0.000]\nλ4 = 1.000, v4 = [-0.957, 0.273, 0.000, 0.000, 0.091]\nλ5 = 0.000, v5 = [0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000]\n\nThe first two principal components are the eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues:\n\nPC1 = [0.273, 0.957, 0.000, 0.000, 0.091]\nPC2 = [0.000, 0.000, 0.707, 0.707, 0.000]\n\nTo find the proportion of variation explained by each component, we divide the eigenvalue of each component by the sum of all eigenvalues:\n\nTotal variation = λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 + λ5 = 8.246 + 5.754 + 3.000 + 1.000 + 0.000 = 18\n\nProportion of variation explained by PC1 = λ1 / Total variation = 8.246 / 18 ≈ 0.458\nProportion of variation explained by PC2 = λ2 / Total variation = 5.754 / 18 ≈ 0.320\n\nSo, the first principal component explains approximately 45.8% of the variation, and the second principal component explains approximately 32.0% of the variation."
