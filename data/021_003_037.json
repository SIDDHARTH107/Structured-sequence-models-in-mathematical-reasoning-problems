    "message_2": "To estimate the value of the function at x = 2.5 and x = 7 using Lagrange polynomials, we first need to find the Lagrange polynomial that passes through the given data points. The Lagrange polynomial is given by:\n\nL(x) = L_0(x) * y_0 + L_1(x) * y_1 + L_2(x) * y_2 + L_3(x) * y_3 + L_4(x) * y_4\n\nwhere L_i(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials and y_i are the y-values of the given data points.\n\nThe Lagrange basis polynomials are given by:\n\nL_i(x) = Π((x - x_j) / (x_i - x_j)) for j ≠ i\n\nNow, let's calculate the Lagrange basis polynomials for the given data points:\n\nL_0(x) = ((x - 2) * (x - 3) * (x - 4) * (x - 5)) / ((1 - 2) * (1 - 3) * (1 - 4) * (1 - 5)) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)\n\nL_1(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 3) * (x - 4) * (x - 5)) / ((2 - 1) * (2 - 3) * (2 - 4) * (2 - 5)) = (x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)\n\nL_2(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 4) * (x - 5)) / ((3 - 1) * (3 - 2) * (3 - 4) * (3 - 5)) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 4)(x - 5)\n\nL_3(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) * (x - 5)) / ((4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3) * (4 - 5)) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 5)\n\nL_4(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) * (x - 4)) / ((5 - 1) * (5 - 2) * (5 - 3) * (5 - 4)) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)\n\nNow, we can find the Lagrange polynomial L(x):\n\nL(x) = L_0(x) * 3 + L_1(x) * 6 + L_2(x) * 11 + L_3(x) * 18 + L_4(x) * 27\n\nTo estimate the value of the function at x = 2.5, we plug in x = 2.5 into L(x):\n\nL(2.5) = L_0(2.5) * 3 + L_1(2.5) * 6 + L_2(2.5) * 11 + L_3(2.5) * 18 + L_4(2.5) * 27 ≈ 7.8125\n\nTo extrapolate the value of the function at x = 7, we plug in x = 7 into L(x):\n\nL(7) = L_0(7) * 3 + L_1(7) * 6 + L_2(7) * 11 + L_3(7) * 18 + L_4(7) * 27 ≈ 135\n\nSo, the estimated value of the function at x = 2.5 is approximately 7.8125, and the extrapolated value of the function at x = 7 is approximately 135."
