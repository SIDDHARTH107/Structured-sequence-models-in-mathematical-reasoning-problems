    "message_2": "To determine the specific value of n, we can use the relationship between the scalar curvature R and the Ricci curvature Ric. The scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci curvature, which can be expressed as:\n\nR = g^(ij) * Ric_(ij)\n\nwhere g^(ij) is the inverse of the metric tensor g_(ij), and Ric_(ij) is the Ricci curvature tensor. We are given that Ric = 2g, so Ric_(ij) = 2g_(ij). Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\nR = g^(ij) * 2g_(ij)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the trace of the product of a matrix and its inverse is equal to the dimension of the matrix. In this case, the dimension of the matrix is n, so:\n\nR = 2n\n\nWe are given that R = 6, so:\n\n6 = 2n\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nn = 3\n\nTherefore, the specific value of n is 3. The Riemannian manifold M is a 3-dimensional manifold with scalar curvature R = 6 and Ricci curvature Ric = 2g."
