    "message_1": "A metal plate with sides of length 1 meter is placed in a large oven. The temperature of the plate is initially 100°C, and the temperature of the oven is held constant at 200°C. At time t=0, the temperature at the edges of the plate is held constant at 0°C, and the temperature of the entire plate begins to rise due to heat transfer from the oven. \n\nUsing the Fourier transform, calculate the temperature distribution of the metal plate after 5 minutes have elapsed. Assume the thermal diffusivity of the plate is 0.01 m^2/s and the temperature at the center of the plate is still 100°C at t=0.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the 2D heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions. The 2D heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α (∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and y are the spatial coordinates.\n\nBoundary conditions:\nT(0, y, t) = T(1, y, t) = T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 1, t) = 0\n\nInitial condition:\nT(x, y, 0) = 100\n\nWe will use the method of separation of variables to solve this problem. Let T(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation and dividing by XT, we get:\n\n(1/T)(dT/dt) = α [(1/X)(d²X/dx²) + (1/Y)(d²Y/dy²)]\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ.\n\nNow we have three ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. (1/T)(dT/dt) = -αλ\n2. (1/X)(d²X/dx²) = -λ\n3. (1/Y)(d²Y/dy²) = -λ\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n1. T(t) = C₃ exp(-αλt)\n2. X(x) = C₁ cos(√λx) + C₂ sin(√λx)\n3. Y(y) = C₄ cos(√λy) + C₅ sin(√λy)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we find that C₁ = C₄ = 0 and λ = (m² + n²)π², where m and n are integers. Thus, the solution is of the form:\n\nT(x, y, t) = Σ[Σ[A(m, n) sin(mπx) sin(nπy) exp(-(m² + n²)π²αt)]]\n\nwhere A(m, n) are the coefficients to be determined using the initial condition.\n\nTo find A(m, n), we use the initial condition T(x, y, 0) = 100:\n\n100 = Σ[Σ[A(m, n) sin(mπx) sin(nπy)]]\n\nWe can find A(m, n) by multiplying both sides by sin(m'πx) sin(n'πy) and integrating over the domain [0, 1] x [0, 1]:\n\nA(m', n') = (4/π²) ∫[∫[100 sin(m'πx) sin(n'πy) dx dy]]\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nA(m', n') = (400/π²) [(-1)^(m'+1) + 1] [(-1)^(n'+1) + 1] / (m' n')\n\nNow we can write the temperature distribution after 5 minutes (300 seconds):\n\nT(x, y, 300) = Σ[Σ[(400/π²) [(-1)^(m+1) + 1] [(-1)^(n+1) + 1] / (m n) sin(mπx) sin(nπy) exp(-(m² + n²)π²α(300))]]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution of the metal plate after 5 minutes have elapsed. Note that the series converges quickly, so only a few terms are needed for a good approximation."
