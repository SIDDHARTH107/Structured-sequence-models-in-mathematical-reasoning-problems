    "message_1": "Consider the non-convex function f(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 +12x. Find the minimum value of this function by using the gradient descent algorithm, starting from the initial point x = 2 and set the learning rate to 0.01.",
    "message_2": "To apply the gradient descent algorithm, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient of the function at any point x.\n\nf(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 + 12x\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^4 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 + 12x) = 8x^3 - 9x^2 - 22x + 12\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent algorithm to find the minimum value of the function. We start at the initial point x = 2 and update the value of x using the learning rate (0.01) and the gradient of the function at the current point.\n\nThe update rule for gradient descent is:\nx_new = x_old - learning_rate * f'(x_old)\n\nWe will perform a few iterations of the gradient descent algorithm to get closer to the minimum value:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_old = 2\nx_new = x_old - 0.01 * f'(x_old) = 2 - 0.01 * (8(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 - 22(2) + 12) = 2 - 0.01 * (64 - 72 - 44 + 12) = 2 + 0.01 * 40 = 2.4\n\nIteration 2:\nx_old = 2.4\nx_new = x_old - 0.01 * f'(x_old) = 2.4 - 0.01 * (8(2.4)^3 - 9(2.4)^2 - 22(2.4) + 12) ≈ 2.4 - 0.01 * 16.704 ≈ 2.233\n\nIteration 3:\nx_old = 2.233\nx_new ≈ 2.233 - 0.01 * f'(2.233) ≈ 2.233 - 0.01 * 6.372 ≈ 2.176\n\nWe can continue this process for more iterations to get closer to the minimum value. However, it's important to note that gradient descent is not guaranteed to find the global minimum for non-convex functions, and it may converge to a local minimum instead. In practice, you may need to try different initial points and learning rates, or use more advanced optimization algorithms to find the global minimum."
