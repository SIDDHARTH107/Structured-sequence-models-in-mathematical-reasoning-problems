    "message_2": "To apply the Hungarian algorithm, we need to have a weighted bipartite graph. However, the problem statement only provides the number of vertices and edges, not the weights or the specific connections between vertices. Therefore, we cannot directly apply the Hungarian algorithm without more information.\n\nPlease provide the weighted bipartite graph or the adjacency matrix representing the graph, and then we can proceed with the Hungarian algorithm to find the perfect matching."
