    "message_2": "Let X be a compact Riemann surface of genus 2 embedded in projective 3-space with degree 5. Let L be a line bundle of degree 9 on X. We want to find the dimension of the space of holomorphic sections of L, denoted by h^0(X, L).\n\nBy Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nwhere g is the genus of X (in this case, g = 2), and h^1(X, L) is the dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms on X with coefficients in L.\n\nSince X is a compact Riemann surface of genus 2, it has a canonical line bundle K_X with degree 2g - 2 = 2. By Serre duality, we have:\n\nh^1(X, L) = h^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1))\n\nNow, K_X ⊗ L^(-1) is a line bundle of degree 2 - 9 = -7. Since the degree is negative, there are no non-zero holomorphic sections, so h^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1)) = 0.\n\nThus, h^1(X, L) = 0, and by Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh^0(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g = 9 + 1 - 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the space of holomorphic sections of the line bundle with degree 9 on the Riemann surface is 8."
