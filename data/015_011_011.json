    "message_2": "A double pendulum is a highly complex and chaotic system, which means that even a slight change in the initial conditions can lead to drastically different behaviors. In this case, the initial angles of the double pendulum are 179° and 180°. Due to the chaotic nature of the system, it is not possible to provide an exact analytical solution for the maximum angle of each pendulum's swing and the number of swings in 30 seconds for each initial angle.\n\nHowever, we can discuss the general behavior of the double pendulum with these initial angles. When the initial angle is 179°, the pendulum is almost completely inverted, and the motion will be highly chaotic and unpredictable. The maximum angle of each pendulum's swing and the number of swings in 30 seconds will depend on various factors such as the lengths and masses of the pendulum arms, as well as the initial angular velocities.\n\nOn the other hand, when the initial angle is 180°, the pendulum is in a completely inverted and unstable equilibrium position. In the absence of any external perturbations, the pendulum would theoretically remain in this position indefinitely. However, in reality, even the slightest disturbance will cause the pendulum to move away from this equilibrium position and exhibit chaotic motion, similar to the case with the initial angle of 179°.\n\nIn conclusion, the behavior of a double pendulum with initial angles of 179° and 180° will be highly chaotic and sensitive to the initial conditions. It is not possible to provide exact values for the maximum angle of each pendulum's swing and the number of swings in 30 seconds without considering the specific parameters of the system and performing numerical simulations."
