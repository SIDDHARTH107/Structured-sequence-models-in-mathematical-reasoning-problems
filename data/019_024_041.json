    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces x units of a particular item at a cost of $y per unit. The manufacturer sells each unit for $z. If the profit made by the manufacturer is $100, what is the minimum number of units that must be produced to break even?",
    "message_2": "To break even, the manufacturer's total cost must be equal to the total revenue. The total cost is the number of units produced (x) multiplied by the cost per unit (y), and the total revenue is the number of units produced (x) multiplied by the selling price per unit (z).\n\nTotal Cost = x * y\nTotal Revenue = x * z\n\nAt break-even point, Total Cost = Total Revenue, so:\n\nx * y = x * z\n\nTo find the minimum number of units that must be produced to break even, we need to solve for x:\n\nx * (z - y) = 0\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum number of units, x must be greater than 0. Therefore, the equation (z - y) must be equal to 0:\n\nz - y = 0\n\nz = y\n\nHowever, we are given that the profit made by the manufacturer is $100. Profit can be calculated as:\n\nProfit = Total Revenue - Total Cost\n100 = x * z - x * y\n\nSince z = y, the equation becomes:\n\n100 = x * y - x * y\n\n100 = 0\n\nThis equation is not possible, as the profit cannot be $100 if the manufacturer is breaking even. Therefore, there is not enough information provided to determine the minimum number of units that must be produced to break even."
