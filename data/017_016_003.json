    "message_2": "A cyclic group of order n has φ(n) generators, where φ is the Euler's totient function. The Euler's totient function counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.\n\nFor a prime number p, φ(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1), where k is a positive integer.\n\nIn this case, the group has order 27, which can be written as 3^3. Therefore, we can apply the formula for the Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(27) = φ(3^3) = 3^3 - 3^(3-1) = 27 - 9 = 18\n\nSo, a group of order 27 that is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 has 18 generators."
