    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum number of edges in a connected graph with 12 vertices. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. So, the minimum number of edges in a connected graph with 12 vertices is 12 - 1 = 11 edges.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of edges in a connected graph with 12 vertices and diameter D. We can construct a graph with diameter D by connecting a central vertex to D/2 layers of vertices on each side (if D is even) or (D-1)/2 layers on one side and (D+1)/2 layers on the other side (if D is odd). Each layer will have one more vertex than the previous layer.\n\nFor example, if D = 4, we can have a central vertex connected to 2 layers on each side:\nLayer 0: 1 vertex (central vertex)\nLayer 1: 2 vertices\nLayer 2: 3 vertices\nTotal vertices: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 vertices\n\nIf D = 5, we can have a central vertex connected to 2 layers on one side and 3 layers on the other side:\nLayer 0: 1 vertex (central vertex)\nLayer 1: 2 vertices\nLayer 2: 3 vertices\nLayer 3: 4 vertices\nTotal vertices: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 vertices\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of edges in a connected graph with 12 vertices and diameter D. We can do this by adding edges between vertices in the same layer and between vertices in adjacent layers. For example, if D = 4, we can add edges between the 2 vertices in layer 1 and between the 3 vertices in layer 2. This will result in a total of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 edges.\n\nIf D = 5, we can add edges between the 2 vertices in layer 1, between the 3 vertices in layer 2, and between the 4 vertices in layer 3. This will result in a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 18 edges, which is more than the minimum number of edges for a connected graph with 12 vertices (11 edges) and less than the maximum number of edges for a connected graph with 12 vertices and diameter 5 (10 edges), the diameter of the graph must be less than or equal to 5.\n\nTo find the exact diameter, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between each pair of vertices in the graph. The diameter will be the maximum of these shortest paths. However, without the adjacency matrix or adjacency list of the graph, we cannot perform the BFS algorithm. Therefore, we can only conclude that the diameter of the graph is less than or equal to 5."
