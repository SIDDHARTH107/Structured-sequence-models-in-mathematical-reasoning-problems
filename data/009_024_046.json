    "message_2": "To solve the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations for the given problem, we first need to write down the governing equations for incompressible flow in a square cavity. The continuity equation and the momentum equations in their non-dimensional form are given by:\n\nContinuity equation:\n∇ · u = 0\n\nMomentum equations:\n(∂u/∂t) + (u · ∇)u = -∇p + (1/Re)∇²u\n\nHere, u is the velocity vector, p is the pressure, and Re is the Reynolds number. For the given problem, the Reynolds number is 100, which is defined as:\n\nRe = (ρUL) / μ\n\nwhere ρ is the density (1000 kg/m³), U is the initial maximum velocity (1 m/s), L is the length of the cavity (1 m), and μ is the dynamic viscosity (0.001 Pa·s).\n\nTo solve the Navier-Stokes equations, we can use a numerical method such as the finite difference method or the finite volume method. The solution will provide the velocity and pressure fields in the cavity. However, calculating the time taken for the vortices to dissipate completely is a complex task and requires a detailed analysis of the flow field.\n\nOne way to estimate the time scale for the dissipation of vortices is to use the concept of eddy turnover time. The eddy turnover time (τ) can be defined as the ratio of the kinetic energy (K) to the dissipation rate (ε):\n\nτ = K / ε\n\nThe kinetic energy (K) can be calculated as:\n\nK = 0.5 * ρ * ∫(u² + v²) dA\n\nwhere u and v are the velocity components in the x and y directions, respectively, and the integral is taken over the area of the cavity.\n\nThe dissipation rate (ε) can be estimated as:\n\nε = μ * ∫( (∇u)² + (∇v)² ) dA\n\nBy solving the Navier-Stokes equations and calculating the kinetic energy and dissipation rate, we can estimate the eddy turnover time, which gives an approximation of the time taken for the vortices to dissipate completely. Note that this is a rough estimate, and a more accurate prediction would require a detailed analysis of the flow field and the vortex dynamics."
