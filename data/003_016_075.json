    "message_2": "The general form of a sinusoidal function is f(x) = A sin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift. In this case, we have:\n\nf(x) = 3 sin(2x - pi/6)\n\nComparing this to the general form, we can see that the phase shift C is equal to pi/6. However, to find the actual phase shift in terms of x, we need to solve for x in the argument of the sine function:\n\n2x - pi/6 = 0\n\nNow, add pi/6 to both sides:\n\n2x = pi/6\n\nFinally, divide by 2:\n\nx = pi/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function is pi/12."
