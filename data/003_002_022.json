    "message_1": "If the angle A in a right triangle measures 30 degrees and the hypotenuse is 10 cm, what is the length of the side adjacent to angle A?",
    "message_2": "In a right triangle with a 30-60-90 degree angle, the ratio of the sides is 1:âˆš3:2. Since the hypotenuse is given as 10 cm, we can set up the proportion:\n\n2 (hypotenuse) = 10 cm\n1 (adjacent side) = x cm\n\nTo find the length of the side adjacent to angle A, we can set up the proportion:\n\nx / 10 = 1 / 2\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n2x = 10\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, the length of the side adjacent to angle A is 5 cm."
