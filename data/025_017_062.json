    "message_2": "1. To show that the curve is nonsingular, we need to check that the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are not simultaneously zero at any point on the curve. The partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^3 + y^3 - 3xy) = 3x^2 - 3y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^3 + y^3 - 3xy) = 3y^2 - 3x$\n\nNow, suppose there exists a point $(a, b)$ on the curve such that both partial derivatives are zero. Then we have:\n\n$3a^2 - 3b = 0 \\Rightarrow a^2 = b$\n\n$3b^2 - 3a = 0 \\Rightarrow b^2 = a$\n\nSince $a^2 = b$ and $b^2 = a$, we have $a^4 = a$ and $b^4 = b$. This implies that $a$ and $b$ are either $0$ or $1$. However, if $a = b = 0$, the curve equation is not satisfied. If $a = b = 1$, the curve equation is also not satisfied. Thus, there is no point on the curve where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero, and the curve is nonsingular.\n\n2. To find a birational transformation that takes the curve to the elliptic curve $E : y^2 = x^3 - x$, we can try to find a rational map between the two curves. Let's define the rational map $\\phi : (x, y) \\mapsto (X, Y)$ as follows:\n\n$X = x^2 - y^2$\n\n$Y = xy$\n\nNow, we can check if this map takes the curve to the elliptic curve:\n\n$Y^2 = x^2y^2 = (x^2 - y^2)(x^2 + y^2) = X(X + 2y^2)$\n\nSince $x^3 + y^3 = 3xy$, we have $x^3 - x = y^3 - y$, and thus:\n\n$X^3 - X = (x^2 - y^2)^3 - (x^2 - y^2) = (y^3 - x^3) = 3xy - 2y^3 = 3Y - 2Y^2/X$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$Y^2 = X^3 - X = X(X + 2Y^2/X)$\n\nThis shows that the rational map $\\phi$ takes the curve to the elliptic curve $E : y^2 = x^3 - x$.\n\n3. The degree of the function field extension $\\mathbb{C}(E)/\\mathbb{C}(x, y)$ is the degree of the extension of the function fields of the two curves. Since we have found a birational transformation between the two curves, the function fields are isomorphic, and the degree of the extension is 1."
