    "message_2": "First, let's recall some definitions and theorems:\n\n1. A group G is cyclic if there exists an element a in G such that every element of G can be written as a power of a.\n2. A group G is isomorphic to another group H if there exists a bijective function f: G -> H such that f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a, b in G.\n3. The order of an element a in a group G is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n4. Lagrange's Theorem: If G is a finite group and H is a subgroup of G, then the order of H divides the order of G.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the problem. We are given a group G of order 20. If G has an element of order 20, let's call it a, then by definition, G is cyclic and generated by a. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20.\n\nIf G does not have an element of order 20, then the possible orders of elements in G are divisors of 20 that are not 20 itself, which are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10. Since G has order 20, by Cauchy's theorem, there must exist elements of order 2 and 5. Let's call these elements a and b, respectively.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by b. Since b has order 5, H is a cyclic group of order 5, and by Lagrange's theorem, H is a normal subgroup of G. Then, we can form the quotient group G/H, which has order 20/5 = 4. Since there are only two groups of order 4, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V, and G/H has an element of order 2 (the coset aH), G/H must be isomorphic to C4.\n\nNow, let's consider the semidirect product of H and G/H. Since G/H is isomorphic to C4, there exists an element c in G such that c^4 = e and c is not in H. Then, the elements of G can be written as {b^i c^j | 0 ≤ i < 5, 0 ≤ j < 4}. Since G has 20 elements and this set has 20 elements, G must be isomorphic to the semidirect product of H and G/H.\n\nThere are two possible isomorphisms for the semidirect product of H and G/H, depending on the action of G/H on H. If the action is trivial, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and G/H, which is a non-abelian group of order 20. If the action is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, which is also a non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nIn conclusion, if G does not have an element of order 20, then G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20."
