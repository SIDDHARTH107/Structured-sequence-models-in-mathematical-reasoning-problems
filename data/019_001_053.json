    "message_1": "Consider the following two propositions: \n\n1. p: It is raining today.\n2. q: I will go to the movies tonight.\n\nIf p is true and q is false, what is the truth value of the proposition \"If it is raining today, then I will go to the movies tonight.\"?",
    "message_2": "The proposition \"If it is raining today, then I will go to the movies tonight\" can be represented as an implication: p â†’ q. The truth value of an implication is false only when the antecedent (p) is true and the consequent (q) is false. In this case, p is true and q is false, so the truth value of the proposition \"If it is raining today, then I will go to the movies tonight\" is false."
