    "message_2": "First, we will show that $E$ is isomorphic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ to an elliptic curve of the form $y^2 = x^3 - 5^r dx$ for some positive integer $x$. To do this, we will apply a change of variables to transform the equation of $E$ into the desired form.\n\nLet $x' = 5^{r/3}x$ and $y' = 5^{r/2}y$. Then, we have\n$$y'^2 = 5^r y^2 = 5^r (x^3 + ax + b) = x'^3 + 5^{r/3}ax' + 5^r b.$$\n\nNow, let $E'$ be the elliptic curve defined by the equation\n$$y'^2 = x'^3 - 5^r dx'.$$\n\nWe want to show that $E$ and $E'$ are isomorphic over $\\mathbb{Q}$. To do this, we need to find a rational transformation between the two curves. Let $a' = 5^{r/3}a$ and $b' = 5^r b$. Then, we have\n$$y'^2 = x'^3 + a'x' + b' = x'^3 - 5^r dx'.$$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we find that $a' = -5^r d$. Thus, we have\n$$a = -5^{r/3} d.$$\n\nNow, we are given that $E$ is the curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$ which satisfies $\\Delta = -4\\cdot 1^3$. In this case, we have $a = -1$ and $b = 0$. The discriminant is given by $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) = -64$. Since $\\Delta = 5^r d$, we have $r = 0$ and $d = -16$.\n\nNow, we can find the desired $x$. From the equation $a = -5^{r/3} d$, we have\n$$-1 = -5^{0/3}(-16) \\Rightarrow x = 16.$$\n\nThus, the elliptic curve $E$ is isomorphic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ to the curve $E'$ given by the equation\n$$y^2 = x^3 - 5^r dx = x^3 - 16x.$$"
