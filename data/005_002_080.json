    "message_1": "Suppose that a research study found a sample mean of 72 with a standard deviation of 5. The researcher wants to estimate the true population mean with 95% confidence. What is the confidence interval for the population mean?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (based on the standard normal distribution) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nHowever, the sample size is not provided in the problem. To proceed, we need the sample size (n). Please provide the sample size to calculate the confidence interval."
