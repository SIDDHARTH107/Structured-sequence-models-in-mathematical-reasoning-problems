    "message_2": "To determine if G is a planar graph, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have v = 10 and e = 15. We can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that G is a planar graph. However, we need to consider one more condition for planarity, which is the girth of the graph. The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph.\n\nIf the girth of G is 3, then we can use another inequality for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 2v - 4\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n15 ≤ 2 * 10 - 4\n15 ≤ 20 - 4\n15 ≤ 16\n\nThis inequality does not hold, which means that if the girth of G is 3, then G is not a planar graph. If the girth of G is greater than 3, then it is possible that G is a planar graph.\n\nTo find the girth of G, we can use the average degree of the graph:\n\naverage degree = (2 * e) / v\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\naverage degree = (2 * 15) / 10\naverage degree = 30 / 10\naverage degree = 3\n\nSince the average degree is 3, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more. This means that there is a cycle of length 3 in the graph. Therefore, the girth of G is 3.\n\nSince the girth of G is 3 and the inequality e ≤ 2v - 4 does not hold, G is not a planar graph."
