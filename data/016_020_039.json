    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of small tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the number of small tetrahedra in the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of small tetrahedra = 4^(iteration number - 1)\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of small tetrahedra = 4^(5 - 1) = 4^4 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 small tetrahedra in the 5th iteration of the construction of the Sierpinski tetrahedron."
