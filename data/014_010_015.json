    "message_1": "Suppose we have a substitution cipher where each letter in the alphabet is replaced by another letter from the alphabet (not necessarily distinct). How many possible ways are there to create such a cipher?",
    "message_2": "In a substitution cipher, each letter in the alphabet can be replaced by any of the 26 letters (including itself). Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, for each letter, there are 26 choices for substitution.\n\nSo, for the first letter, there are 26 choices, for the second letter, there are 26 choices, and so on, for all 26 letters in the alphabet.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible ways to create such a cipher is:\n\n26 * 26 * 26 * ... * 26 (26 times)\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n26^26\n\nSo, there are 26^26 (approximately 2.03 * 10^36) possible ways to create a substitution cipher where each letter in the alphabet is replaced by another letter from the alphabet (not necessarily distinct)."
