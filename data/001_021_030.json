    "message_2": "To find all the solutions of the given cubic equation, we can first try to factor it. \n\n$x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 8 = 0$\n\nNotice that the coefficients are in the pattern of a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. Let's try to factor by grouping:\n\n$x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 8 = x^2(x - 7) + 2(x - 7)$\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term $(x - 7)$:\n\n$x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 8 = (x - 7)(x^2 + 2)$\n\nNow we have a quadratic factor and a linear factor. The linear factor gives us one solution:\n\n$x - 7 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 7$\n\nTo find the remaining solutions, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\n$x^2 + 2 = 0$\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n$x^2 = -2$\n\nSince the right side is negative, there are no real solutions for this quadratic equation. However, we can find the complex solutions by taking the square root of both sides:\n\n$x = \\pm \\sqrt{-2}$\n\nSo, the complex solutions are:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{2}i$ and $x = -\\sqrt{2}i$\n\nIn conclusion, the solutions of the given cubic equation are:\n\n$x = 7, \\sqrt{2}i, -\\sqrt{2}i$"
