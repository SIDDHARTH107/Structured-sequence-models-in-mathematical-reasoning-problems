    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 10th iteration, the formula becomes:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^10)\n\nLength = 1 * 1024\n\nLength = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 10th iteration is 1024 units."
