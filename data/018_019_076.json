Let's first find the symmetric difference between A and B.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {5}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {5} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference between the result (A ∆ B) and C.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {5, 6, 7}) - ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {5, 6, 7})\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {5, 6, 7} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n{1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {5, 6, 7} = {}\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNow, to show that the operation of symmetric difference is associative for these three sets, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = A ∆ (B ∆ C)\n\nWe already found (A ∆ B) ∆ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
