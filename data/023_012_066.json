    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor this problem, the function f(x) is defined on the interval -π < x < π. We can find the coefficients a_n and b_n using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)] dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[1] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[0] dx from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [x | from -π to 0] = (1/π) * [0 - (-π)] = 1\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[1 * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[0 * cos(n * x)] dx from 0 to π]\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * sin(n * x) | from -π to 0] = 0\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[1 * sin(n * x)] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[0 * sin(n * x)] dx from 0 to π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * cos(n * x) | from -π to 0] = (1/π) * [(1/n) * (1 - cos(n * π))]\n\nNow we have the coefficients, so we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = 1 + Σ [(1/π) * (1/n) * (1 - cos(n * π)) * sin(n * x)]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the sum of the series at x = 0:\n\nf(0) = 1 + Σ [(1/π) * (1/n) * (1 - cos(n * π)) * sin(n * 0)]\nf(0) = 1 + Σ [0] = 1\n\nSo, the sum of the series at x = 0 is 1."
