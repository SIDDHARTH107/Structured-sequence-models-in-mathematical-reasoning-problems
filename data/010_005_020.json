    "message_2": "1. Is the space X connected?\n\nA space is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In this case, we can represent X as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets: {a, b, c} and {d}. Since {a, b, c} and {d} are both open sets in the given topology and their union is X, the space X is not connected.\n\n2. Is the space X path-connected?\n\nA space is path-connected if for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] -> X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. In this topology, there is no continuous function that connects the points 'c' and 'd' because there is no open set containing 'd' that also contains any point from {a, b, c}. Therefore, the space X is not path-connected.\n\n3. If X is not path-connected, find distinct paths between any two points in X.\n\nSince X is not path-connected, we cannot find paths between any two points in X. However, we can find paths between some points in X:\n\n- For points within {a, b, c}, we can find paths between them. For example, a path between 'a' and 'b' can be defined by the function f(t) = a for t in [0, 0.5) and f(t) = b for t in [0.5, 1].\n- Similarly, for points within {a, b, c, d}, we can find paths between them. For example, a path between 'b' and 'c' can be defined by the function g(t) = b for t in [0, 0.5) and g(t) = c for t in [0.5, 1].\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, we cannot find paths between points 'c' and 'd' in this topology."
