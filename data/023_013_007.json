    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Fourier Analysis and Using the Fourier transform to solve heat transfer problems:\n\nA metal rod with a length of 10 cm and a cross-sectional area of 2 cm² has an initial temperature of 100°C. It is suddenly placed in a liquid at 20°C. The temperature of the rod is then measured at various time intervals. Using the Fourier transform, calculate the temperature distribution on the metal rod at t = 5 seconds with a known heat diffusion coefficient of 0.5 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature distribution on the rod, α is the heat diffusion coefficient, t is the time, and x is the position along the rod.\n\nThe initial condition is:\n\nu(x,0) = 100°C for 0 < x < 10 cm\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n\nu(0,t) = u(10,t) = 20°C for t > 0\n\nTo solve this problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = 100 = A₀ + Σ [A_n cos(nπx/L) + B_n sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere A₀, A_n, and B_n are the Fourier coefficients, and L is the length of the rod (10 cm).\n\nSince the initial condition is an even function, all B_n coefficients will be zero. We can find the A_n coefficients using the following formula:\n\nA_n = (2/L) ∫[u(x,0) cos(nπx/L)] dx from 0 to L\n\nFor n = 0, A₀ = (1/L) ∫[u(x,0)] dx from 0 to L\n\nNow, we can plug the initial condition u(x,0) = 100 into the A_n formula:\n\nA_n = (2/10) ∫[100 cos(nπx/10)] dx from 0 to 10\n\nA₀ = (1/10) ∫[100] dx from 0 to 10\n\nBy solving the integrals, we get:\n\nA₀ = 100\n\nA_n = (20/nπ) [sin(nπ) - 0] = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nNow, we can write the solution to the heat equation as:\n\nu(x,t) = 100 + Σ [A_n cos(nπx/L) e^(-αn²π²t/L²)]\n\nSince all A_n coefficients are zero except for A₀, the solution simplifies to:\n\nu(x,t) = 100\n\nThis means that the temperature distribution on the metal rod at t = 5 seconds is constant and equal to 100°C. However, this result contradicts the boundary conditions, which state that the temperature at the ends of the rod should be 20°C. This discrepancy arises because the problem statement does not provide enough information to determine the temperature distribution on the rod. In a real-world scenario, additional information about the heat transfer between the rod and the liquid would be required to solve this problem accurately."
