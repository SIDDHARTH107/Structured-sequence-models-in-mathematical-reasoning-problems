    "message_2": "The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (y-values) that the function can produce. In this case, the function is y = |x - 2| + 3.\n\nThe absolute value function, |x - 2|, will always produce a non-negative value, since it represents the distance between x and 2 on the number line. The smallest value it can produce is 0, which occurs when x = 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the entire function y = |x - 2| + 3. Since the absolute value part is always non-negative, the smallest value for y occurs when the absolute value part is 0. In this case, y = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nAs x moves away from 2, the absolute value part will increase, and so will the value of y. There is no upper bound on how large y can become, as the absolute value part can grow indefinitely.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function y = |x - 2| + 3 is all real numbers greater than or equal to 3, which can be written in interval notation as [3, âˆž)."
