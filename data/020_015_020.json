    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangular garden is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 84 meters of fencing, we can write the equation as:\n\n84 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that will maximize the area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can rearrange the perimeter equation to solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (84 - 2L) / 2\nW = 42 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (42 - L)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area function with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 42 - 2L\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0, we get:\n\n0 = 42 - 2L\n2L = 42\nL = 21\n\nNow, substitute this value of L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 42 - 21\nW = 21\n\nSo, the dimensions that will maximize the enclosed area are length L = 21 meters and width W = 21 meters, making the garden a square. The maximum enclosed area will be:\n\nArea = 21 * 21 = 441 square meters."
