    "message_2": "To determine the number of 1-cells in the Morse-Smale complex, we can use the Morse inequalities. The Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of a smooth function to the homology groups of the underlying space.\n\nLet's denote the number of critical points of index i by m_i. In this case, we have m_0 = 1 (one minimum), m_1 = 0 (no saddle points), and m_2 = 2 (two maxima).\n\nThe Morse inequalities state that the rank of the i-th homology group H_i(X) is less than or equal to m_i. Since X is a compact connected surface, its Euler characteristic χ(X) can be computed as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension:\n\nχ(X) = #0-cells - #1-cells + #2-cells\n\nWe are given that the Morse-Smale complex has 5 cells in total. Since there is one minimum and two maxima, there are 1 + 2 = 3 cells of dimension 0 and 2, respectively. Thus, there must be 5 - 3 = 2 cells of dimension 1, which are the 1-cells.\n\nSo, the Morse-Smale complex of f has 2 1-cells."
