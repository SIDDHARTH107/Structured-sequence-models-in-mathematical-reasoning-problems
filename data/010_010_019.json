    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$. Let's compute these partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, which is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the type of this critical point. To do this, we can use the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2$\n\nSo the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we need to analyze the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix to determine the type of the critical point. The eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are:\n\n$\\lambda_1 = 2$\n\n$\\lambda_2 = 2$\n\nSince both eigenvalues are positive, the Hessian matrix is positive definite. This means that the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a local minimum.\n\nUsing Morse theory, we can classify the critical point as follows:\n\n- If all eigenvalues are positive, the critical point is a local minimum (Morse index 0).\n- If all eigenvalues are negative, the critical point is a local maximum (Morse index n, where n is the dimension of the space).\n- If there are both positive and negative eigenvalues, the critical point is a saddle point (Morse index between 0 and n).\n\nIn this case, the critical point $(0, 0)$ has Morse index 0, which means it is a local minimum."
