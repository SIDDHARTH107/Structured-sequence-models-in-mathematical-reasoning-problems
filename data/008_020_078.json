    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y + z = 12 \n\n4x - 2y - z = -6 \n\n6x + 5y + 3z = 28\n\nUse matrix methods to find the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 2  3  1 | 12\n| 4 -2 -1 | -6\n| 6  5  3 | 28\n```\n\nNext, we will perform Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n| 1  3/2  1/2 |  6\n| 4 -2   -1  | -6\n| 6  5    3  | 28\n```\n\n2. Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  3/2  1/2 |  6\n| 0 -5   -3  | -30\n| 0 -4   1   | 4\n```\n\n3. Multiply the second row by -1/5:\n\n```\n| 1  3/2  1/2 |  6\n| 0  1    3/5 |  6\n| 0 -4    1   |  4\n```\n\n4. Add 4 times the second row to the third row and subtract 3/2 times the second row from the first row:\n\n```\n| 1  0   -1/2 | -3\n| 0  1    3/5 |  6\n| 0  0    17/5|  28\n```\n\n5. Multiply the third row by 5/17:\n\n```\n| 1  0   -1/2 | -3\n| 0  1    3/5 |  6\n| 0  0    1   |  28/5\n```\n\n6. Add 1/2 times the third row to the first row and subtract 3/5 times the third row from the second row:\n\n```\n| 1  0   0   | -1\n| 0  1   0   |  2\n| 0  0   1   |  28/5\n```\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the matrix: x = -1, y = 2, and z = 28/5."
