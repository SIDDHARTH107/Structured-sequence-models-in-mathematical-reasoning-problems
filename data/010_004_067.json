    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the method of contradiction. Suppose that for each n, there exists a point x_n in X such that x_n is in U_n. We will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, which implies that there must exist a sequence of points {x_n} in X such that x_n is not in U_n for any positive integer n.\n\nSince X is a compact metric space, it is sequentially compact, which means that every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence. So, there exists a subsequence {x_{n_k}} of {x_n} that converges to a point x in X. \n\nNow, since X is not covered by any finite subcollection of {U_n}, there must exist a point y in X that is not in any of the sets U_1, U_2, ..., U_N for some positive integer N. \n\nConsider the subsequence {x_{n_k}} for k > N. Since x_{n_k} is in U_{n_k} for all k > N, and {x_{n_k}} converges to x, it follows that x must be in the closure of the union of the sets U_{n_k} for k > N. \n\nHowever, since each U_n is open, the closure of the union of the sets U_{n_k} for k > N is contained in the union of the sets U_{n_k} for k > N. Therefore, x must be in one of the sets U_{n_k} for some k > N. \n\nBut this contradicts the fact that y is not in any of the sets U_1, U_2, ..., U_N, since x and y are distinct points in X. \n\nThus, our assumption that for each n, there exists a point x_n in X such that x_n is in U_n must be false. Therefore, there exists a sequence of points {x_n} in X such that x_n is not in U_n for any positive integer n."
