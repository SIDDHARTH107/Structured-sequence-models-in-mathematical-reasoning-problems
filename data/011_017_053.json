    "message_1": "What is the maximum order a Latin square can have if each entry can only take values from the set {1, 2, 3} and no two entries in the same row or column can take the same value?",
    "message_2": "A Latin square of order n is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and each column. In this case, the set of symbols is {1, 2, 3}. \n\nSince there are only 3 different symbols, the maximum order a Latin square can have in this case is 3. This is because if we try to create a Latin square of order 4 or larger, we would need at least 4 different symbols to fill the rows and columns without repeating any symbol in the same row or column.\n\nHere's an example of a Latin square of order 3 using the given set {1, 2, 3}:\n\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 2"
