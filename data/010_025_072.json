Find the number of ribbons that need to be attached to the surface S.",
    "message_2": "To construct a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) with the desired property, we will use the Atiyah-Segal axioms for TQFTs. In particular, we will focus on the partition function Z(S) and its relation to the Euler characteristic χ(S).\n\nRecall that the Euler characteristic of a surface S with genus g is given by:\n\nχ(S) = 2 - 2g\n\nNow, let's consider attaching n ribbons to the surface S. Each ribbon will introduce a handle to the surface, effectively increasing its genus. Let g' be the genus of the new surface S' after attaching the n ribbons. Then:\n\ng' = g + n\n\nThe Euler characteristic of the new surface S' is:\n\nχ(S') = 2 - 2g'\n\nNow, we want the partition function Z(S) of the original surface S to be equal to the Euler characteristic of the new surface S':\n\nZ(S) = χ(S')\n\nSince we are considering a TQFT, the partition function Z(S) should be a topological invariant, meaning it should only depend on the topology of the surface S and not on any additional structure. In particular, Z(S) should be equal to the Euler characteristic of the original surface S:\n\nZ(S) = χ(S) = 2 - 2g\n\nThus, we want:\n\n2 - 2g = 2 - 2(g + n)\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\n2g = 2n\nn = g\n\nSo, the number of ribbons that need to be attached to the surface S is equal to its genus g."
