Suppose that L is an ample line bundle on X such that the square of its first Chern class is equal to 3 times the class of a hyperplane section. Calculate the degree of the line bundle L on X.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the degree of the line bundle L on X, we first need to understand the given condition: the square of the first Chern class of L is equal to 3 times the class of a hyperplane section.\n\nLet H be the class of a hyperplane section on X. The given condition can be written as:\n\nc_1(L)^2 = 3H.\n\nNow, let's recall the definition of the degree of a line bundle L on a projective variety X. The degree of L, denoted as deg(L), is the intersection number of the first Chern class of L with the fundamental class of X:\n\ndeg(L) = c_1(L) · [X].\n\nSince X is a Calabi-Yau variety of dimension 3, it has trivial canonical bundle, which means that the first Chern class of the canonical bundle K_X is zero:\n\nc_1(K_X) = 0.\n\nUsing the adjunction formula, we can relate the first Chern class of L and the canonical bundle:\n\nc_1(L) = c_1(K_X) + H.\n\nSince c_1(K_X) = 0, we have:\n\nc_1(L) = H.\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the given condition:\n\nc_1(L)^2 = H^2 = 3H.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of L:\n\ndeg(L) = c_1(L) · [X] = H · [X].\n\nSince X is a 3-dimensional variety, the intersection number [X] can be expressed as the triple intersection of the hyperplane class:\n\n[X] = H^3.\n\nNow, we can use the given condition to compute the degree of L:\n\ndeg(L) = H · [X] = H · H^3 = (3H) · H^2 = 3H^3.\n\nSo, the degree of the line bundle L on X is 3 times the cube of the class of a hyperplane section:\n\ndeg(L) = 3H^3."
