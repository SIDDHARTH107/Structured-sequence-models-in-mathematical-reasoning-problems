    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x - 3| = 5, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 3 = 5\nSolving for x, we get:\n2x = 8\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 2x - 3 = -5\nSolving for x, we get:\n2x = -2\nx = -1\n\nSo, the two possible values of x that make the equation true are x = 4 and x = -1."
