    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle is:\n\nArea = (π - (α + β + γ)) * R^2\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle, and R is the radius of the hyperbolic plane. However, we are given the edge length, not the radius. To find the radius, we can use the hyperbolic law of cosines:\n\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) - sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(γ)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the edge lengths, and γ is the angle opposite to edge c. Since all edge lengths are equal (5 cm), we can simplify this equation:\n\ncosh(5) = cosh(5) * cosh(5) - sinh(5) * sinh(5) * cos(30°)\n\nNow, we can solve for the radius R:\n\nR = arccosh(cosh(5) / cos(30°))\n\nR ≈ 2.317\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the area of the triangle using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\nArea = (π - (70° + 80° + 30°)) * 2.317^2\nArea = (π - (180°)) * 5.367\nArea ≈ 0 * 5.367\nArea = 0\n\nThe area of the given hyperbolic triangle is 0 square centimeters."
