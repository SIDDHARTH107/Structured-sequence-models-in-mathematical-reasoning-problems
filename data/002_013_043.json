    "message_1": "What is the volume of a rectangular pyramid with a base length of 5 cm, a base width of 8 cm, and a height of 10 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, you can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nIn this case, the base area is the product of the base length and base width:\n\nBase area = 5 cm * 8 cm = 40 cm²\n\nNow, you can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 40 cm² * 10 cm = (40/3) * 10 cm³ = 400/3 cm³ ≈ 133.33 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 133.33 cubic centimeters."
