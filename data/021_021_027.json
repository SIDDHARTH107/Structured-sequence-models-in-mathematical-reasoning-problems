    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose you want to minimize the following function using the Cuckoo Search Algorithm:\nf(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1  in the range -5 ≤ x ≤ 5.\n\nUsing Cuckoo Search Algorithm with 100 iterations and 25 initial nests, find the minimum value of the function and the value of x where it occurs. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is not possible for me to perform the algorithm directly as I am a text-based AI. However, I can provide you with the steps to perform the Cuckoo Search Algorithm and you can implement it in a programming language of your choice.\n\nHere are the steps to perform the Cuckoo Search Algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population of nests (solutions) randomly within the given range (-5 ≤ x ≤ 5).\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) using the given function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1.\n3. Set the maximum number of iterations (100 in this case).\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Select a random nest (cuckoo) and generate a new solution by performing a random walk (Levy flight) in the search space.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. Choose a random nest to be replaced by the new solution if the new solution has better fitness.\n   d. Perform a fraction (pa) of the worst nests to be abandoned and replaced by new random solutions.\n   e. Update the best solution found so far.\n5. After 100 iterations, return the best solution found and its corresponding fitness value.\n\nOnce you implement the Cuckoo Search Algorithm, you will get the minimum value of the function and the value of x where it occurs. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth."
