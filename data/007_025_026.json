    "message_1": "Consider a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between two parties, Alice and Bob. Alice chooses a prime number p=23 and a primitive root g=5. She selects a secret key a=6 and calculates A=(g^a) mod p. Bob chooses a secret key b=15 and calculates B=(g^b) mod p. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for secure communication?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate A and B.\n\nA = (g^a) mod p = (5^6) mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\nB = (g^b) mod p = (5^15) mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19\n\nNow, Alice and Bob will compute the shared secret key using each other's public keys (A and B) and their own private keys (a and b).\n\nShared secret key for Alice = (B^a) mod p = (19^6) mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\nShared secret key for Bob = (A^b) mod p = (8^15) mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for secure communication is 2."
