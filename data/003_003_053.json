    "message_2": "To find the exact value of sine and cosine of 300 degrees using the unit circle method, we first need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. \n\nTo convert from degrees to radians, we use the formula:\n\nradians = (degrees × π) / 180\n\nSo, for 300 degrees:\n\nradians = (300 × π) / 180 = (5π) / 3\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle method. The unit circle has a radius of 1, and we can find the coordinates (x, y) of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle. The x-coordinate represents the cosine of the angle, and the y-coordinate represents the sine of the angle.\n\nSince 300 degrees is in the fourth quadrant, both sine and cosine will have different signs. The reference angle for 300 degrees is 360 - 300 = 60 degrees, or π/3 radians.\n\nWe can use the 30-60-90 triangle properties to find the sine and cosine of the reference angle (π/3). In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. \n\nFor a 60-degree angle (π/3 radians), the sine is opposite/hypotenuse, and the cosine is adjacent/hypotenuse. \n\nsin(π/3) = (√3) / 2\ncos(π/3) = 1 / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the sine and cosine of the 300-degree angle (5π/3 radians). Since it's in the fourth quadrant, the sine will be negative, and the cosine will be positive.\n\nsin(300°) = sin(5π/3) = -sin(π/3) = -√3 / 2\ncos(300°) = cos(5π/3) = cos(π/3) = 1 / 2\n\nSo, the exact values of sine and cosine of 300 degrees are:\n\nsin(300°) = -√3 / 2\ncos(300°) = 1 / 2"
