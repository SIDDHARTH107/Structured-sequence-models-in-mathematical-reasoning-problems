    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of $X$, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, we need to divide the hexagon into two simply connected open sets $U$ and $V$ whose intersection is also simply connected.\n\nLet $U$ be the interior of the hexagon, and let $V$ be a small open neighborhood of the boundary of the hexagon. Their intersection $U \\cap V$ is an annulus, which is simply connected. Since $U$ is simply connected, its fundamental group is trivial: $\\pi_1(U) = \\{1\\}$.\n\nNow we need to find the fundamental group of $V$. To do this, we can consider the boundary of the hexagon as a loop in $V$. Let $a$ be the loop that goes around the hexagon once. Since successive edges are identified with opposite orientation, we have the following identifications: $a^2 = a^4 = a^6 = 1$. Therefore, the fundamental group of $V$ is generated by $a$ with the relation $a^6 = 1$: $\\pi_1(V) = \\langle a \\mid a^6 = 1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_6$.\n\nNow we need to find the fundamental group of the intersection $U \\cap V$. Since $U \\cap V$ is an annulus, its fundamental group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, generated by a loop that goes around the annulus once. Let $b$ be this loop. Notice that $b$ is homotopic to $a$ in $V$, so we have $b = a$ in $\\pi_1(U \\cap V)$.\n\nNow we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of $X$ is the free product of $\\pi_1(U)$ and $\\pi_1(V)$, with the relation $b = a$:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) = \\pi_1(U) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V)} \\pi_1(V) = \\{1\\} *_{\\langle a \\mid a^6 = 1 \\rangle} \\langle a \\mid a^6 = 1 \\rangle \\cong \\langle a \\mid a^6 = 1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_6$$\n\nSo the fundamental group of $X$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_6$."
