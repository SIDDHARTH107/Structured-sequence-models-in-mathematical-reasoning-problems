    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Let U be the universal set. Find the value of (A △ B)' ∆ (A' ∆ B') where △ denotes the symmetric difference and ' denotes the complement. Show that it is not equal to [(A △ B)' ∆ A'] ∆ [(A △ B)' ∆ B'].",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. So, A △ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}.\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A △ B, which is (A △ B)'. Since we don't know the universal set U, we cannot find the exact complement. However, we can express it in terms of U: (A △ B)' = U - {1, 2, 5, 6}.\n\nNext, let's find the complements of A and B. Again, we can express them in terms of U:\nA' = U - {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB' = U - {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B': A' ∆ B' = (U - {1, 2, 3, 4}) ∆ (U - {3, 4, 5, 6}). The symmetric difference is {1, 2, 5, 6}.\n\nNow we can find the symmetric difference of (A △ B)' and (A' ∆ B'): ((A △ B)') ∆ (A' ∆ B') = (U - {1, 2, 5, 6}) ∆ {1, 2, 5, 6}. Since the symmetric difference of a set and its complement is the universal set U, we have (A △ B)' ∆ (A' ∆ B') = U.\n\nNow let's find the other expression: [(A △ B)' ∆ A'] ∆ [(A △ B)' ∆ B'].\n\nFirst, find (A △ B)' ∆ A' = (U - {1, 2, 5, 6}) ∆ (U - {1, 2, 3, 4}) = {3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nNext, find (A △ B)' ∆ B' = (U - {1, 2, 5, 6}) ∆ (U - {3, 4, 5, 6}) = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nFinally, find the symmetric difference of the two sets: [{3, 4, 5, 6} ∆ {1, 2, 3, 4}] = {1, 2, 5, 6}.\n\nSo, we have (A △ B)' ∆ (A' ∆ B') = U and [(A △ B)' ∆ A'] ∆ [(A △ B)' ∆ B'] = {1, 2, 5, 6}. Since U ≠ {1, 2, 5, 6}, the two expressions are not equal."
