    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we will use the formula:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere y is the sales revenue, x is the amount spent on advertising, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of the x values (amount spent) and the mean of the y values (sales revenue):\n\nMean of x values (amount spent):\n(10 + 8 + 12 + 15 + 9 + 11) / 6 = 65 / 6 = 10.8333\n\nMean of y values (sales revenue):\n(20 + 18 + 22 + 24 + 19 + 21) / 6 = 124 / 6 = 20.6667\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (m) of the regression line. To do this, we will use the formula:\n\nm = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / Σ[(xi - x_mean)^2]\n\nwhere xi and yi are the individual x and y values, and x_mean and y_mean are the means of the x and y values.\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n(10 - 10.8333)(20 - 20.6667) + (8 - 10.8333)(18 - 20.6667) + (12 - 10.8333)(22 - 20.6667) + (15 - 10.8333)(24 - 20.6667) + (9 - 10.8333)(19 - 20.6667) + (11 - 10.8333)(21 - 20.6667) = 9.1667\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n(10 - 10.8333)^2 + (8 - 10.8333)^2 + (12 - 10.8333)^2 + (15 - 10.8333)^2 + (9 - 10.8333)^2 + (11 - 10.8333)^2 = 20.8333\n\nNow, we can find the slope (m):\nm = 9.1667 / 20.8333 = 0.44\n\nFinally, we need to find the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = y_mean - m * x_mean\nb = 20.6667 - 0.44 * 10.8333 = 15.3333\n\nNow, we have the equation of the regression line:\n\ny = 0.44x + 15.3333\n\nSo, the relationship between the amount spent on advertising and the sales revenue generated can be represented by the equation:\n\nSales Revenue (in millions) = 0.44 * (Amount Spent in thousands) + 15.3333"
