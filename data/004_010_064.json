    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x - 10, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, for the given function:\n\n∫(4x^3 + 2x - 10) dx = ∫(4x^3) dx + ∫(2x) dx - ∫(10) dx\n\nNow, apply the power rule for each term:\n\n∫(4x^3) dx = 4∫(x^3) dx = 4(x^(3+1))/(3+1) = 4x^4/4 = x^4\n\n∫(2x) dx = 2∫(x^1) dx = 2(x^(1+1))/(1+1) = 2x^2/2 = x^2\n\n∫(10) dx = 10∫(1) dx = 10(x^(0+1))/(0+1) = 10x^1/1 = 10x\n\nNow, combine the results and add the constant of integration (C):\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 10x + C"
