    "message_2": "a) A x B is the Cartesian product of sets A and B, which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. So, A x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\nb) B x A is the Cartesian product of sets B and A, which consists of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A. So, B x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}.\n\nc) A x B and B x A are not equal. The difference between them is the order of the elements in the ordered pairs. In A x B, the elements from set A come first in the ordered pairs, while in B x A, the elements from set B come first."
