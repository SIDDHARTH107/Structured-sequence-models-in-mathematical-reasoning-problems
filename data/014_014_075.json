    "message_2": "First, we need to create a 5x5 Playfair cipher table using the keyword \"MATHS\". The table will look like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNote that the letter \"J\" is not included in the table, as it is usually combined with \"I\" in the Playfair cipher.\n\nNow, we will encrypt the plaintext \"ATTACK NOW\" using the table:\n\n1. Break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters): AT TA CK NO W\n2. Since the first pair has the same letter, we need to insert a filler letter (usually 'X') between them: AT TX AC K NO W\n3. Find the digraphs in the table and apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n   - AT: A and T are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if necessary): TB\n   - TX: T and X are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle and replace them with the letters in the same row but at the opposite corners: TM\n   - AC: A and C are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if necessary): TB\n   - K: Since there's only one letter left, we need to add a filler letter (usually 'X') to form a digraph: KX\n   - KX: K and X are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle and replace them with the letters in the same row but at the opposite corners: HL\n   - NO: N and O are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle and replace them with the letters in the same row but at the opposite corners: RU\n   - W: Since there's only one letter left, we need to add a filler letter (usually 'X') to form a digraph: WX\n   - WX: W and X are in different rows and columns, so form a rectangle and replace them with the letters in the same row but at the opposite corners: PV\n\nThe final ciphertext is: TBTM TBHL RUPV"
