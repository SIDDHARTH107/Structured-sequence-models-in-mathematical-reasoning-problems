    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 8 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of three different sizes.\n\n1. The area of the two faces with length and width (lw) dimensions:\nArea = length × width = 10 cm × 5 cm = 50 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 × 50 cm² = 100 cm².\n\n2. The area of the two faces with length and height (lh) dimensions:\nArea = length × height = 10 cm × 8 cm = 80 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 × 80 cm² = 160 cm².\n\n3. The area of the two faces with width and height (wh) dimensions:\nArea = width × height = 5 cm × 8 cm = 40 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 × 40 cm² = 80 cm².\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all three pairs of faces:\nSurface area = 100 cm² + 160 cm² + 80 cm² = 340 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 340 cm²."
