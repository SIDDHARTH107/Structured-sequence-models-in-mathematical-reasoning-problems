    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute code or perform real-time calculations. However, I can guide you through the steps to implement the cuckoo search algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function.\n\n1. Define the objective function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 1.\n\n2. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Population size (n) = 20\n   - Maximum generations (max_gen) = 1000\n   - Step size (alpha) = 0.05\n   - Domain: -2 <= x <= 2\n\n3. Generate an initial population of 20 random solutions (x values) within the domain.\n\n4. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the objective function.\n\n5. For each generation (up to max_gen):\n   a. Choose a random solution (cuckoo) from the population.\n   b. Generate a new solution (new_cuckoo) by adding a random step (based on step size) to the current solution.\n   c. If the new solution is within the domain, evaluate its fitness using the objective function.\n   d. Choose a random solution (nest) from the population to compare with the new solution.\n   e. If the fitness of the new solution is better than the fitness of the nest, replace the nest with the new solution.\n   f. Sort the population based on fitness.\n   g. Replace the worst solutions with new random solutions (to simulate the discovery of new nests by the cuckoo).\n   h. Repeat steps a-g until the maximum number of generations is reached.\n\n6. The best solution (minimum value) will be the one with the lowest fitness in the final population.\n\nPlease note that the cuckoo search algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the result may not be the exact global minimum. However, it should provide a good approximation of the minimum value for the given function within the specified domain."
