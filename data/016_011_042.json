    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is generated by replacing each line segment with a pattern of smaller line segments. In each iteration, the number of line segments increases by a factor of 4. \n\nLet's calculate the number of line segments in each iteration:\n\n1st iteration: 1 line segment (initial shape)\n2nd iteration: 1 * 4 = 4 line segments\n3rd iteration: 4 * 4 = 16 line segments\n4th iteration: 16 * 4 = 64 line segments\n\nSo, there are 64 line segments in the 4th iteration of the Vicsek fractal if the initial shape is a single line segment of length 1 unit."
