    "message_1": "In the Dictator Game, Player 1 is given $100 to split with Player 2. Player 1 can choose to keep all $100 or give some amount to Player 2. If Player 1 chooses to give some amount, Player 2 cannot refuse what is given. If both players are rational and Player 2 values money equally to Player 1, what is the minimum amount that Player 1 should share with Player 2 to ensure that both players receive a positive payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, Player 2 has no power to influence the outcome, and Player 1 is aware of this. Since both players are rational and value money equally, Player 1 will aim to maximize their own payoff. Therefore, the minimum amount that Player 1 should share with Player 2 to ensure that both players receive a positive payoff is the smallest possible positive amount, which can be considered as close to $0 as possible. In practice, this could be $1 or even $0.01, depending on the smallest unit of currency being used in the game."
