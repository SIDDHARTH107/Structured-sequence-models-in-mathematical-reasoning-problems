    "message_2": "To find the steady-state solution u(x, t) for t > 0, we need to solve the wave equation with the given initial displacement u(x, 0) = x(10 - x). The wave equation is given by:\n\n∂²u/∂t² = c² ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere c is the wave speed. Since we are looking for the steady-state solution, we can assume that the solution is of the form:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[A_n * sin(n * π * x / L) * e^(-α * n^2 * π^2 * t / L^2)]\n\nwhere L is the length of the string (10 meters in this case), n is an integer, and α is a constant related to the damping of the wave. The initial displacement is given by:\n\nu(x, 0) = x(10 - x) = ∑[A_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions and multiply both sides by sin(m * π * x / L) and integrate over the length of the string:\n\n∫[x(10 - x) * sin(m * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L = ∫[A_n * sin(n * π * x / L) * sin(m * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nUsing the orthogonality property, the right-hand side of the equation becomes:\n\nA_m * L / 2 if m = n\n0 if m ≠ n\n\nNow, we need to find A_m by evaluating the left-hand side of the equation:\n\nA_m * L / 2 = ∫[x(10 - x) * sin(m * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let u = x(10 - x) and dv = sin(m * π * x / L) dx. Then, du = (10 - 2x) dx and v = -(L / (m * π)) * cos(m * π * x / L).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nA_m * L / 2 = [-x(10 - x) * (L / (m * π)) * cos(m * π * x / L)] from 0 to L + (L / (m * π)) * ∫[(10 - 2x) * cos(m * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nNow, let u = 10 - 2x and dv = cos(m * π * x / L) dx. Then, du = -2 dx and v = (L / (m * π)) * sin(m * π * x / L).\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\nA_m * L / 2 = [-x(10 - x) * (L / (m * π)) * cos(m * π * x / L)] from 0 to L - (L^2 / (m^2 * π^2)) * ∫[-2 * sin(m * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nA_m * L / 2 = [-x(10 - x) * (L / (m * π)) * cos(m * π * x / L)] from 0 to L + (2L^2 / (m^2 * π^2)) * [(L / (m * π)) * cos(m * π * x / L)] from 0 to L\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integrals:\n\nA_m * L / 2 = (100L / (m * π)) - (2L^3 / (m^3 * π^3)) * (1 - (-1)^m)\n\nFinally, we can find A_m:\n\nA_m = (200 / (m * π)) - (4L^2 / (m^3 * π^3)) * (1 - (-1)^m)\n\nNow, we can write the steady-state solution u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[(200 / (m * π) - (4L^2 / (m^3 * π^3)) * (1 - (-1)^m)) * sin(m * π * x / L) * e^(-α * m^2 * π^2 * t / L^2)]\n\nThis is the steady-state solution for the given initial displacement u(x, 0) = x(10 - x) and t > 0."
