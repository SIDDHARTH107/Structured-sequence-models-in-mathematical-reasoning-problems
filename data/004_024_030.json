    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nDifferentiating both sides, we get:\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (y^2) + d/dx (x*y) = d/dx (25)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) + (1*y + x*dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\ndy/dx (2y + x) = -2x - y\n\nSo,\ndy/dx = (-2x - y) / (2y + x)\n\nNow we need to find the value of y when x = 3. To do this, we'll plug x = 3 back into the original equation:\n(3)^2 + y^2 + 3*y = 25\n\n9 + y^2 + 3y = 25\ny^2 + 3y - 16 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n(y - 4)(y + 4) = 0\n\nSo, we have two possible values for y: y = 4 and y = -4. We'll consider both cases and calculate the corresponding dy/dx values.\n\nCase 1: y = 4\ndy/dx = (-2(3) - 4) / (2(4) + 3)\ndy/dx = (-6 - 4) / (8 + 3)\ndy/dx = -10 / 11\n\nCase 2: y = -4\ndy/dx = (-2(3) - (-4)) / (2(-4) + 3)\ndy/dx = (-6 + 4) / (-8 + 3)\ndy/dx = -2 / -5\ndy/dx = 2 / 5\n\nSo, we have two possible values for dy/dx: -10/11 and 2/5. We'll round both to two decimal places:\ndy/dx â‰ˆ -0.91 or 0.40"
