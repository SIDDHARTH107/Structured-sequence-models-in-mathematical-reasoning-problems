    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order 7 is cyclic, we will use the fact that a group of prime order is always cyclic.\n\nLet G be a group of order 7. Since 7 is a prime number, we can use Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. The only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, so the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and 7.\n\nNow, let's consider an element a in G, where a is not the identity element. The subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, must have order 7, because if it had order 1, then a would be the identity element, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nSince <a> has order 7 and G has order 7, we can conclude that <a> = G. This means that G is generated by a single element, which is the definition of a cyclic group. Therefore, every group of order 7 is cyclic."
