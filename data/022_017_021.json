    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first find the characteristic equation:\n\n$r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0$\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\n$(r - 1)(r - 2) = 0$\n\nSo, the roots are $r_1 = 1$ and $r_2 = 2$. Since the roots are distinct, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x} = C_1 e^x + C_2 e^{2x}$\n\nNow, we use the initial conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\n1) $y(0) = 2$:\n\n$2 = C_1 e^0 + C_2 e^0 = C_1 + C_2$\n\n2) $y'(0) = 1$:\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the general solution:\n\n$y'(x) = C_1 e^x + 2C_2 e^{2x}$\n\nThen, we use the initial condition:\n\n$1 = C_1 e^0 + 2C_2 e^0 = C_1 + 2C_2$\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\n$\n\\begin{cases}\nC_1 + C_2 = 2 \\\\\nC_1 + 2C_2 = 1\n\\end{cases}\n$\n\nSolving this system, we find that $C_1 = 3$ and $C_2 = -1$. Therefore, the solution of the differential equation is:\n\n$y(x) = 3e^x - e^{2x}$"
