    "message_2": "We will use the Morse theory to prove the statement. Let $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function on the compact and connected manifold $X$. Recall that a Morse function is a smooth function with non-degenerate critical points, i.e., the Hessian matrix at each critical point is non-singular. By Sard's theorem, we know that almost every smooth function is a Morse function, so we can assume that $f$ is Morse without loss of generality.\n\nLet $m_k$ denote the number of critical points of $f$ with index $k$, where the index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point. The Morse inequalities state that for each $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n$ (where $n$ is the dimension of $X$), we have:\n\n$$m_k \\geq \\dim H^k(X, \\mathbb{R}).$$\n\nNow, we know that $H^1(X, \\mathbb{R})$ is one-dimensional, so $\\dim H^1(X, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$m_1 \\geq 1.$$\n\nNext, we consider the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. Recall that the Euler characteristic is defined as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers, which are the dimensions of the homology groups:\n\n$$\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\dim H_k(X, \\mathbb{R}).$$\n\nBy PoincarÃ© duality, we have $\\dim H_k(X, \\mathbb{R}) = \\dim H^{n-k}(X, \\mathbb{R})$ for all $k$. Therefore, we can rewrite the Euler characteristic as:\n\n$$\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\dim H^k(X, \\mathbb{R}).$$\n\nNow, let $c = \\min_{0 \\leq k \\leq n} \\frac{m_k}{\\dim H^k(X, \\mathbb{R})}$, where we take the minimum over all non-zero dimensions. Note that $c > 0$ since all dimensions are non-zero. Then, we have:\n\n$$c \\cdot \\chi(X) = c \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\dim H^k(X, \\mathbb{R}) \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k m_k.$$\n\nSince $m_1 \\geq 1$, we have:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k m_k \\geq m_0 - m_1 + \\sum_{k=2}^n (-1)^k m_k \\geq m_0 - 1 + \\sum_{k=2}^n (-1)^k m_k.$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$c \\cdot \\chi(X) \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k m_k \\leq m_0 - 1 + \\sum_{k=2}^n (-1)^k m_k.$$\n\nSince the number of critical points of $f$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^n m_k$, we have:\n\n$$c \\cdot \\chi(X) \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^n m_k - 1.$$\n\nAdding 1 to both sides, we obtain:\n\n$$c \\cdot \\chi(X) + 1 \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^n m_k.$$\n\nHence, there exists a constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that the number of critical points of $f$ is greater than or equal to $c \\cdot \\chi(X)$."
