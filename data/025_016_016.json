    "message_2": "First, let's show that the transcendence degree of k(X) over k is equal to the transcendence degree of k(Y) over k when there exists a rational function f: X --> Y and its inverse f^{-1}: Y --> X.\n\nSince f and f^{-1} are rational functions, they can be represented as quotients of polynomials with coefficients in k. Let f = p(x, y)/q(x, y) and f^{-1} = r(u, v)/s(u, v), where p, q, r, and s are polynomials in k[x, y] and k[u, v], respectively.\n\nNow, consider the field extension k(X) / k(f(X)). Since f is a rational function, k(f(X)) is a subfield of k(X). Similarly, k(Y) / k(f^{-1}(Y)) is a field extension, and k(f^{-1}(Y)) is a subfield of k(Y). Since f and f^{-1} are inverses, we have k(f^{-1}(f(X))) = k(X) and k(f(f^{-1}(Y))) = k(Y).\n\nBy the properties of transcendence degree, we have:\n\ntrdeg_k(k(X)) = trdeg_k(k(f^{-1}(f(X)))) = trdeg_k(k(Y)) + trdeg_k(k(f^{-1}(Y)) / k(Y)).\n\nSimilarly,\n\ntrdeg_k(k(Y)) = trdeg_k(k(f(f^{-1}(Y)))) = trdeg_k(k(X)) + trdeg_k(k(f(X)) / k(X)).\n\nComparing these two equations, we get:\n\ntrdeg_k(k(X)) - trdeg_k(k(Y)) = trdeg_k(k(f(X)) / k(X)) - trdeg_k(k(f^{-1}(Y)) / k(Y)).\n\nSince both sides of the equation are integers, and the difference between the transcendence degrees of k(X) and k(Y) is equal to the difference between the transcendence degrees of k(f(X)) / k(X) and k(f^{-1}(Y)) / k(Y), we must have trdeg_k(k(X)) = trdeg_k(k(Y)).\n\nNow, let's find a rational function f: X --> Y and its inverse f^{-1}: Y --> X for the given example. Let X be the variety defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 and let Y be the line defined by the equation y = x.\n\nConsider the rational function f(x, y) = (x + y) / (1 + x * y). We claim that this function maps X to Y. To see this, note that if (x, y) âˆˆ X, then x^2 + y^2 = 1. Thus, we have:\n\nf(x, y) = (x + y) / (1 + x * y) = x / (1 - y) = y / (1 - x).\n\nSince f(x, y) = y / (1 - x), we have y = f(x, y) * (1 - x), which is an equation of the form y = x * g(x, y) for some rational function g(x, y). Therefore, f maps X to Y.\n\nNow, let's find the inverse function f^{-1}: Y --> X. Let u = x + y and v = 1 + x * y. Then, we have x = (u - y) / (1 + y^2) and y = (u - x) / (1 + x^2). Solving for x and y in terms of u and v, we get:\n\nx = (u - v) / (1 - u * v) and y = (u + v) / (1 + u * v).\n\nThus, the inverse function f^{-1}(u, v) = ((u - v) / (1 - u * v), (u + v) / (1 + u * v)) is also a rational function.\n\nBy the first part of the solution, we have trdeg_k(k(X)) = trdeg_k(k(Y)). In this example, both X and Y are curves, so their function fields have transcendence degree 1 over k. Therefore, trdeg_k(k(X)) = trdeg_k(k(Y)) = 1."
