    "message_1": "Let f(z) be a meromorphic function on the complex plane with poles at z = -1 and z = 2, and zeros at z = -3 and z = 4. If f(0) = 3, find the residue of f at z = -1.",
    "message_2": "We can write f(z) as a product of its zeros and poles:\n\nf(z) = k * (z + 3)(z - 4) / ((z + 1)(z - 2))\n\nwhere k is a constant. We are given that f(0) = 3, so we can solve for k:\n\n3 = k * (0 + 3)(0 - 4) / ((0 + 1)(0 - 2))\n3 = k * (-3)(-4) / (-2)\n3 = k * 12 / (-2)\nk = -1/2\n\nSo, f(z) = -1/2 * (z + 3)(z - 4) / ((z + 1)(z - 2))\n\nNow, we want to find the residue of f at z = -1. Since z = -1 is a simple pole, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * f(z)]\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * (-1/2 * (z + 3)(z - 4) / ((z + 1)(z - 2)))]\n\nThe (z + 1) term cancels out:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [-1/2 * (z + 3)(z - 4) / (z - 2)]\n\nNow, we can plug in z = -1:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = -1/2 * (-1 + 3)(-1 - 4) / (-1 - 2)\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = -1/2 * (2)(-5) / (-3)\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = 5/3\n\nTherefore, the residue of f at z = -1 is 5/3."
