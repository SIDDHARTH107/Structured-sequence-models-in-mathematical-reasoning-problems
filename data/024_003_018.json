    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the Gaussian curvature of a particular surface which is defined by the equation: \n\nz = x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 6y + 11\n\nWhat is the Gaussian curvature of this surface at the point (2,3)?",
    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface, we first need to find the first and second partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y.\n\nThe equation is: z = x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 6y + 11\n\nFirst partial derivatives:\n∂z/∂x = 2x - 4\n∂z/∂y = 2y - 6\n\nSecond partial derivatives:\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = ( (∂²z/∂x²)(∂²z/∂y²) - (∂²z/∂x∂y)^2 ) / ( 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 + (∂z/∂y)^2 )^2\n\nAt the point (2,3), the first partial derivatives are:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2(2) - 4 = 0\n∂z/∂y = 2(3) - 6 = 0\n\nSince the first partial derivatives are both 0, the denominator of the Gaussian curvature formula simplifies to 1:\n\nK = ( (∂²z/∂x²)(∂²z/∂y²) - (∂²z/∂x∂y)^2 ) / 1\n\nK = ( 2 * 2 - 0^2 ) / 1\nK = 4\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (2,3) is 4."
