    "message_2": "To prove that 4n + 3 is an odd integer for all values of n, where n is a non-negative integer, we need to show that it can be written in the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nConsider the expression 4n + 3. We can rewrite it as:\n\n4n + 3 = 2(2n) + 3\n\nNow, since n is a non-negative integer, 2n is also an integer (because the product of two integers is an integer). Let k = 2n. Then, k is an integer, and we have:\n\n4n + 3 = 2k + 3 = 2(k) + 1\n\nSince k is an integer, 2k + 1 is an odd integer. Therefore, 4n + 3 is an odd integer for all values of n, where n is a non-negative integer."
