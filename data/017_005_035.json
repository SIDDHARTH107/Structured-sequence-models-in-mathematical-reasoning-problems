    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G is either 1 or 27. \n\nCase 1: There is only one 3-Sylow subgroup in G.\nLet P be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is the only 3-Sylow subgroup, it is normal in G. Furthermore, since the order of P is 3^3 = 27, we have that P = G. Thus, G is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either a direct product of cyclic groups of order 3 or a cyclic group of order 27. If G is a cyclic group of order 27, we are done. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: There are 27 3-Sylow subgroups in G.\nLet P be one of the 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Since the index of P in G is [G:P] = 27/9 = 3, P is normal in G. Let Q be another 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, PQ is a subgroup of G, and |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 9 * 9 / 3 = 27. Thus, PQ = G. \n\nNow, consider the intersection of P and Q, P ∩ Q. Since P and Q are both of order 9, their intersection must be of order 1 or 3. If |P ∩ Q| = 3, then PQ would have order 9 * 9 / 3 = 27, which contradicts the fact that G has 27 3-Sylow subgroups. Therefore, |P ∩ Q| = 1, and P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also normal in G. Moreover, since P ∩ Q = {e}, we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. Since both P and Q are of order 9, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 27 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
