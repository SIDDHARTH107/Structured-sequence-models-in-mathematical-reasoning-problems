    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle and the concept of Ramsey Theory. To guarantee that there are either three people who all know each other or three people who are all strangers, we need to have at least 6 people in the room.\n\nHere's why:\n\nConsider a single person in the room. This person can either know or not know each of the other people in the room. If there are 5 other people in the room, then by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 3 of these relationships must be either all \"know\" or all \"strangers.\"\n\nLet's assume that the first person (Person A) knows 3 other people (Person B, Person C, and Person D). Now, consider the relationships between B, C, and D. If any of them know each other (e.g., B knows C), then we have a group of three people who all know each other (A, B, and C). If none of them know each other, then we have a group of three people who are all strangers (B, C, and D).\n\nSo, in either case, we are guaranteed to have a group of three people who all know each other or three people who are all strangers when there are 6 people in the room."
