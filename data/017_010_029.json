The cyclic group C10 has 10 elements, so G cannot be isomorphic to C10.\n\nNow let's consider the dihedral group D5. D5 has 10 elements, which are rotations and reflections of a regular pentagon. Since G has only 5 elements, it cannot be isomorphic to D5.\n\nFinally, let's consider the non-abelian group of order 10. A non-abelian group of order 10 would have 10 elements and not be commutative. Since G has only 5 elements, it cannot be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nTherefore, the group G is not isomorphic to any of the given groups (C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10)."
