    "message_2": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the following formula:\n\nInverse(A) = (1/determinant(A)) * adjugate(A)\n\nwhere A is the given matrix, determinant(A) is the determinant of A, and adjugate(A) is the matrix obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of the given matrix A:\n\ndeterminant(A) = (3 * 2) - (4 * 1) = 6 - 4 = 2\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of A:\n\nadjugate(A) = [2 -4]\n              [-1 3]\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\n\nInverse(A) = (1/2) * adjugate(A) = [ 1 -2]\n                                   [-0.5 1.5]\n\nSo, the inverse of the given matrix is:\n\n[ 1  -2 ]\n[-0.5  1.5]"
