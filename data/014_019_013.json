    "message_2": "To encrypt a message with a transposition cipher using a grid with 5 rows, we need to determine the smallest number of columns that can accommodate the 20 letters. To do this, we can divide the total number of letters (20) by the number of rows (5).\n\n20 รท 5 = 4\n\nSo, the smallest number of columns that can be used to encrypt the message is 4."
