    "message_1": "Suppose a student has to choose between two math textbooks, Textbook A and Textbook B. The student thinks that Textbook A has a 70% chance of helping them earn an A in their math class, while Textbook B has only a 60% chance. If the student earns an A, they will receive a bonus of $100. However, Textbook A costs $50 more than Textbook B. Which textbook should the student choose based on expected value?",
    "message_2": "To determine which textbook the student should choose based on expected value, we need to calculate the expected value for each textbook and compare them. \n\nExpected value is calculated as the probability of an event occurring multiplied by the value of that event. In this case, the event is earning an A in the math class, and the value is the $100 bonus minus the cost difference between the textbooks.\n\nFor Textbook A:\nProbability of earning an A = 70% or 0.7\nValue of earning an A = $100 bonus - $50 (cost difference) = $50\nExpected value for Textbook A = 0.7 * $50 = $35\n\nFor Textbook B:\nProbability of earning an A = 60% or 0.6\nValue of earning an A = $100 bonus - $0 (no cost difference) = $100\nExpected value for Textbook B = 0.6 * $100 = $60\n\nComparing the expected values, Textbook B has a higher expected value ($60) than Textbook A ($35). Therefore, the student should choose Textbook B based on expected value."
