    "message_1": "A farmer wants to plant at most 100 acres of land with wheat and corn. It costs $75 to plant an acre of wheat and $100 to plant an acre of corn. The farmer has a budget of $9000 for planting. If the profit per acre of wheat is $200 and the profit per acre of corn is $400, what is the optimal combination of wheat and corn that maximizes the farmer's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of corn. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 100 (total acres constraint)\n2. 75x + 100y ≤ 9000 (budget constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 200x + 400y.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 100\n   y ≤ 100 - x\n\n2. 75x + 100y ≤ 9000\n   y ≤ (9000 - 75x) / 100\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersections of the constraint lines:\n\nA. Intersection of x + y = 100 and 75x + 100y = 9000:\n   x + y = 100\n   75x + 100y = 9000\n   Solving this system, we get x = 20 and y = 80.\n\nB. Intersection of x + y = 100 and y-axis (x = 0):\n   x = 0 and y = 100\n\nC. Intersection of 75x + 100y = 9000 and x-axis (y = 0):\n   75x + 100(0) = 9000\n   x = 120 (This is not within the constraint x + y ≤ 100, so it's not a valid vertex)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at the vertices:\n\nA. P(20, 80) = 200(20) + 400(80) = 4000 + 32000 = 36000\nB. P(0, 100) = 200(0) + 400(100) = 0 + 40000 = 40000\n\nThe optimal combination of wheat and corn that maximizes the farmer's profit is 0 acres of wheat and 100 acres of corn, with a profit of $40,000."
