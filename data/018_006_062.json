    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in the complement of set A, we need to subtract the number of elements in set A from the total number of elements in the universal set U. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements that are in U but not in A. Since there are 40 elements in U and 20 elements in A, there are 40 - 20 = 20 elements in the complement of set A (A').\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U.\n\nThe union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set containing all the elements that are in either A or B or in both. In this case, we want to show that A ∪ A' = U.\n\nSince A contains 20 elements and A' contains the other 20 elements that are not in A, the union of A and A' must contain all 40 elements of the universal set U. There are no elements left out, and there are no extra elements included.\n\nTherefore, A ∪ A' = U, which proves that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
