    "message_2": "To find the sum of two points P and Q on an elliptic curve, we need to find the point R that is the result of adding P and Q. The elliptic curve is given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 5.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope of the line that passes through P and Q. Since P ≠ Q, we can use the following formula for the slope:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2). Plugging in the coordinates of P and Q:\n\nm = (-5 - 4) / (-2 - 3) = -9 / -5 = 9/5\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the point R(x3, y3) using the following formulas:\n\nx3 = m^2 - x1 - x2\ny3 = m(x1 - x3) - y1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx3 = (9/5)^2 - 3 - (-2) = 81/25 - 1 = 56/25\n\ny3 = (9/5)(3 - 56/25) - 4 = (9/5)(19/25) - 4 = 171/125 - 4 = -329/125\n\nSo, the sum of points P and Q on the elliptic curve is the point R(56/25, -329/125)."
