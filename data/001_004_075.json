    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial expression x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x, first look for a common factor among all the terms. In this case, the common factor is x. \n\nFactor out the x:\n\nx(x^2 - 3x + 2)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 can be factored as (x - 1)(x - 2)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial expression is:\n\nx(x - 1)(x - 2)"
