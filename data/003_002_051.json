    "message_2": "In the third quadrant, both the x and y coordinates are negative. Since the reference angle is 45 degrees, we can use the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle to find the exact values of cosine, sine, and tangent.\n\nFor a 45-45-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:1:√2, where the two legs are equal in length and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of each leg.\n\nSince the angle is in the third quadrant, both the x and y coordinates are negative. Therefore, the cosine and sine values will be negative.\n\nCosine (cos) is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In this case, the adjacent side is -1 and the hypotenuse is √2. So, cos(45°) in the third quadrant is:\n\ncos(45°) = -1/√2 = -√2/2\n\nSine (sin) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side is also -1 and the hypotenuse is √2. So, sin(45°) in the third quadrant is:\n\nsin(45°) = -1/√2 = -√2/2\n\nTangent (tan) is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case, the opposite side is -1 and the adjacent side is also -1. So, tan(45°) in the third quadrant is:\n\ntan(45°) = (-1)/(-1) = 1\n\nSo, the exact values of cosine, sine, and tangent of the angle in the third quadrant with a reference angle of 45 degrees are:\n\ncos(45°) = -√2/2\nsin(45°) = -√2/2\ntan(45°) = 1"
