    "message_2": "To simplify the trigonometric expression sin²θ - cos²θ when θ = π/4, we need to find the values of sin(π/4) and cos(π/4) and then square them.\n\nsin(π/4) = √2/2\ncos(π/4) = √2/2\n\nNow, we square both sin(π/4) and cos(π/4):\n\n(sin(π/4))^2 = (√2/2)^2 = 2/4 = 1/2\n(cos(π/4))^2 = (√2/2)^2 = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the expression:\n\nsin²θ - cos²θ = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0\n\nSo, the simplified trigonometric expression is 0."
