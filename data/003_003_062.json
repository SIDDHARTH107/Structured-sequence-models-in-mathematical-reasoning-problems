    "message_2": "To find the cosine value of 120 degrees, we first need to convert the angle to radians. \n\n120 degrees * (π/180) = (2π/3) radians\n\nNow, we can find the cosine value of the angle in radians:\n\ncos(2π/3) = -1/2\n\nSo, the cosine value of angle 120 degrees in the unit circle is -1/2."
