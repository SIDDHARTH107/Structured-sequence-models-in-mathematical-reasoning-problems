    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we can analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 60, which has prime factorization 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2, divides 3 * 5 = 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, divides 2^2 * 5 = 20 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted by n_5, divides 2^2 * 3 = 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\na) If G is isomorphic to C60, then G is a cyclic group of order 60. In this case, there would be only one Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of G. So, we would have n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1. This is a valid possibility.\n\nb) If G is isomorphic to A5 x C2, then G is a direct product of the alternating group A5 of order 5! / 2 = 60 and the cyclic group C2 of order 2. In this case, G would be non-abelian since A5 is non-abelian. We would have n_5 = 6 (since A5 has six Sylow 5-subgroups) and n_2 = 1 (since C2 has one Sylow 2-subgroup). This is also a valid possibility.\n\nc) If G is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, then G is not abelian. In this case, we would have different values for n_2, n_3, and n_5 than in cases (a) and (b). For example, we could have n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, and n_5 = 6. This is also a valid possibility.\n\nIn conclusion, without further information about the structure of G, we cannot determine which of the following groups G is isomorphic to. It could be isomorphic to any of the groups (a) C60, (b) A5 x C2, or (c) one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
