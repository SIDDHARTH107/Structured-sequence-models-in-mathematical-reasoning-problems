    "message_2": "Proof that every subset of X is closed:\n\nLet A be an arbitrary subset of X. To show that A is closed, we need to show that its complement, X \\ A, is open. Since every singleton set {x} is open in X, we can write X \\ A as a union of open sets:\n\nX \\ A = ⋃_{x ∈ (X \\ A)} {x}\n\nThis is a union of open sets, and since the union of open sets is open, X \\ A is open. Therefore, A is closed. This holds for any arbitrary subset A of X, so every subset of X is closed.\n\nExample of a topological space Y in which every subset is open, but not necessarily closed:\n\nConsider the topological space Y = {a, b} with the topology τ = {∅, {a}, {a, b}}. In this topology, every subset of Y is open:\n\n- The empty set ∅ is open by definition.\n- The set {a} is open as it is in τ.\n- The set {a, b} is open as it is in τ.\n\nHowever, not every subset is closed:\n\n- The empty set ∅ is closed since its complement, Y, is open.\n- The set {a, b} is closed since its complement, ∅, is open.\n- The set {a} is not closed since its complement, {b}, is not open (it is not in τ).\n\nThus, the topological space Y = {a, b} with the topology τ = {∅, {a}, {a, b}} is an example of a space in which every subset is open, but not necessarily closed."
