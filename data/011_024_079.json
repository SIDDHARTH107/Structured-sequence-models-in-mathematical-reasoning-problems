The network has five nodes which represent locations, and there are six roads connecting them with different capacities. \n\nNode 1 is the starting point and node 5 is the end point. Each road's capacity is as follows:\n- Road 1: 8 units\n- Road 2: 5 units\n- Road 3: 9 units\n- Road 4: 7 units\n- Road 5: 4 units\n- Road 6: 10 units\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from node 1 to node 5?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from node 1 to node 5, we need to determine the possible paths and their capacities. Let's label the roads as follows:\n\n- Road 1: Node 1 to Node 2\n- Road 2: Node 1 to Node 3\n- Road 3: Node 2 to Node 4\n- Road 4: Node 3 to Node 4\n- Road 5: Node 4 to Node 5\n- Road 6: Node 3 to Node 5\n\nNow, let's find the possible paths and their capacities:\n\n1. Path 1-2-4-5: This path goes through roads 1, 3, and 5. The minimum capacity of these roads is min(8, 9, 4) = 4 units.\n2. Path 1-3-4-5: This path goes through roads 2, 4, and 5. The minimum capacity of these roads is min(5, 7, 4) = 4 units.\n3. Path 1-3-5: This path goes through roads 2 and 6. The minimum capacity of these roads is min(5, 10) = 5 units.\n\nThe maximum amount of goods that can be transported from node 1 to node 5 is the maximum capacity among these paths, which is max(4, 4, 5) = 5 units."
