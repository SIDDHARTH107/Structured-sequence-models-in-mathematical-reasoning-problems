    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n for the series:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the b_n coefficients. The formulas for a_n and b_n are:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx\n\nTo compute the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫(-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * sin(n * π) - (1/n^2) * sin(n * (-π))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, we have:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nThus, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nHowever, we made an error in calculating b_n. Let's correct that:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/n) * cos(n * π) - (-(-π/n) * cos(n * (-π)))]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/n) * cos(n * π) + (π/n) * cos(n * π)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (-2π/n) * cos(n * π) for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [((-2π/n) * cos(n * π) / π) * sin(n * x)]\n\nTo determine whether the series converges or diverges at x = π/2, we can use the Dirichlet's theorem, which states that if a function is piecewise continuous and has a finite number of discontinuities in the interval, its Fourier series converges to the average of the left and right limits at the point of discontinuity.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = x is continuous at x = π/2, so the Fourier series converges to f(π/2) = π/2."
