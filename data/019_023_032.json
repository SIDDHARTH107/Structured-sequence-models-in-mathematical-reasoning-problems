    "message_1": "A math student is trying to find the sum of the first 10 terms of a sequence using inductive logic. The first term is 3 and each subsequent term is obtained by adding 4 to the previous term. What is the sum of the first 10 terms?",
    "message_2": "This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 3 and the common difference d = 4. To find the sum of the first 10 terms, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nS_n = n * (a_1 + a_n) / 2\n\nwhere S_n is the sum of the first n terms, n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term.\n\nFirst, we need to find the 10th term (a_10). We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\na_10 = 3 + (10 - 1) * 4\na_10 = 3 + 9 * 4\na_10 = 3 + 36\na_10 = 39\n\nNow we can find the sum of the first 10 terms:\n\nS_10 = 10 * (3 + 39) / 2\nS_10 = 10 * 42 / 2\nS_10 = 10 * 21\nS_10 = 210\n\nThe sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence is 210."
