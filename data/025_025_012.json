Suppose $\\phi : A \\rightarrow B$ is a noncommutative algebra homomorphism that sends $x$ to $xy$. What is the image of the element $f(x) = x^2 + x + 1$ under this homomorphism?",
    "message_2": "To find the image of the element $f(x) = x^2 + x + 1$ under the homomorphism $\\phi$, we need to apply $\\phi$ to each term of $f(x)$ and then sum the results. Since $\\phi$ sends $x$ to $xy$, we have:\n\n$\\phi(f(x)) = \\phi(x^2 + x + 1) = \\phi(x^2) + \\phi(x) + \\phi(1)$.\n\nNow, we apply $\\phi$ to each term:\n\n$\\phi(x^2) = (\\phi(x))^2 = (xy)^2 = x^2y^2$,\n\n$\\phi(x) = xy$,\n\nand since $\\phi$ is an algebra homomorphism, it sends the identity element to the identity element, so $\\phi(1) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the image of $f(x)$ under $\\phi$ is:\n\n$\\phi(f(x)) = x^2y^2 + xy + 1$."
