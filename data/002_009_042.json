    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 4 cm. What is the total surface area of the cylinder?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nThe area of one circular base is:\nA = π(4 cm)² = 16π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n2 × 16π cm² = 32π cm²\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the lateral surface area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nThe lateral surface area is:\nA = 2π(4 cm)(10 cm) = 80π cm²\n\nFinally, to find the total surface area, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area:\nTotal Surface Area = 32π cm² + 80π cm² = 112π cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is 112π cm²."
