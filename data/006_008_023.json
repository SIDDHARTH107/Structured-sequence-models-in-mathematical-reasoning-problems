    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in July)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on any given day, which is 0.25\n- n is the total number of trials, which is 31 days in July\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want to find the probability for\n\nSince we want to find the probability of it raining at least 8 days, we need to calculate the probability of it raining 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, ..., up to 31 days, and then sum these probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability of it raining at least 8 days in July is:\n\nP(X >= 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + ... + P(X = 31)\n\nWe can calculate each of these probabilities using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 8) = Σ [C(31, k) * (0.25)^k * (0.75)^(31-k)] for k = 8 to 31\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute this sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 8) ≈ 0.8784\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain at least 8 days in July is approximately 0.8784 or 87.84%."
