    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n, where n is a constant, is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then add them together.\n\nThe antiderivative of 4x^3 is (4/4)x^(3+1) = x^4.\nThe antiderivative of 2x^2 is (2/3)x^(2+1) = (2/3)x^3.\nThe antiderivative of 5x is (5/2)x^(1+1) = (5/2)x^2.\n\nNow, we add the antiderivatives of each term together and include the constant of integration, C:\n\nF(x) = x^4 + (2/3)x^3 + (5/2)x^2 + C"
