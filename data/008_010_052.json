    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n|  2  3  5 | 16 |\n| -4 -2  3 |-2  |\n|  3  1 -2 | 7  |\n\nStep 1: Add 2 times the first row to the second row to eliminate the x term in the second row.\n\n|  2  3  5 | 16 |\n|  0  4 13 | 30 |\n|  3  1 -2 |  7 |\n\nStep 2: Add -1.5 times the first row to the third row to eliminate the x term in the third row.\n\n|  2   3   5  | 16 |\n|  0   4  13 | 30 |\n|  0  -3.5 -9.5| -16.5 |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 4.\n\n|  2   3    5  |  16  |\n|  0   1  13/4 | 15/2 |\n|  0 -3.5 -9.5 | -16.5 |\n\nStep 4: Add 3.5 times the second row to the third row to eliminate the y term in the third row.\n\n|  2   3    5  |  16  |\n|  0   1  13/4 | 15/2 |\n|  0   0  -3  | -11  |\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -3.\n\n|  2   3    5  |  16  |\n|  0   1  13/4 | 15/2 |\n|  0   0   1   | 11/3 |\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 11/3.\n\nSubstitute z into the second row: y + (13/4)(11/3) = 15/2\ny = 15/2 - (13/4)(11/3) = 1\n\nSubstitute y and z into the first row: 2x + 3(1) + 5(11/3) = 16\n2x = 16 - 3 - 55/3\n2x = (48 - 55)/3\nx = -7/6\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = -7/6, y = 1, and z = 11/3."
