    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the current density function in cylindrical coordinates, we first need to determine the current density function. In a conducting wire with a circular cross-section, the current density J(r) is typically assumed to be uniform across the cross-section. However, the skin effect causes the current density to be higher near the surface of the conductor and lower in the center at high frequencies. Since the frequency is 50Hz, which is relatively low, we can assume that the current density is uniform across the cross-section.\n\nLet I(t) be the total current flowing through the wire, which is an AC current with a frequency of 50Hz. The current density function J(r, t) can be expressed as:\n\nJ(r, t) = J_0 * δ(r - R) * cos(2πft),\n\nwhere J_0 is the amplitude of the current density, R is the radius of the wire (2mm), f is the frequency (50Hz), and δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of J(r, t) with respect to time t. The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nF[J(r, t)](r, ω) = ∫ J(r, t) * e^(-jωt) dt,\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nPlugging in the expression for J(r, t), we get:\n\nF[J(r, t)](r, ω) = J_0 * δ(r - R) * ∫ cos(2πft) * e^(-jωt) dt.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Euler's formula:\n\ncos(2πft) = (e^(j2πft) + e^(-j2πft))/2.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n\nF[J(r, t)](r, ω) = (J_0/2) * δ(r - R) * ∫ (e^(j(2πf - ω)t) + e^(-j(2πf + ω)t)) dt.\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫ e^(j(2πf - ω)t) dt = (1/j(2πf - ω)) * e^(j(2πf - ω)t),\n∫ e^(-j(2πf + ω)t) dt = (1/j(-2πf - ω)) * e^(-j(2πf + ω)t).\n\nSubstituting these results back into the Fourier transform expression, we get:\n\nF[J(r, t)](r, ω) = (J_0/2) * δ(r - R) * [(1/j(2πf - ω)) * e^(j(2πf - ω)t) + (1/j(-2πf - ω)) * e^(-j(2πf + ω)t)].\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression:\n\nF[J(r, t)](r, ω) = (J_0/2j) * δ(r - R) * [(1/(2πf - ω)) * e^(j(2πf - ω)t) - (1/(2πf + ω)) * e^(-j(2πf + ω)t)].\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the current density function in cylindrical coordinates."
