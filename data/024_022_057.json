    "message_2": "To find the isometries of the given Riemannian metric $g$, we first need to find the coordinate transformation $(x, y) \\mapsto (x', y')$ that preserves the metric, i.e., $g' = g$, where $g'$ is the metric in the new coordinates $(x', y')$. \n\nLet's write the coordinate transformation as:\n$$x' = f(x, y)$$\n$$y' = g(x, y)$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the differentials $dx'$ and $dy'$ in terms of $dx$ and $dy$. Using the chain rule, we have:\n$$dx' = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy$$\n$$dy' = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} dy$$\n\nNow, we can write the metric $g'$ in the new coordinates $(x', y')$ as:\n$$g' = (dx')^2 + (dy')^2 + 2x'y'\\, dx'\\, dy'$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $dx'$ and $dy'$, we get:\n$$g' = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 dx^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 dx^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 dy^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 dy^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right) dx\\, dy + 2f(x, y)g(x, y)\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\right) dx\\, dy$$\n\nFor the transformation to be an isometry, we must have $g' = g$, which gives us the following system of equations:\n1. $\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 = 1$\n2. $\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 = 1$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = 0$\n4. $f(x, y)g(x, y)\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\right) = xy$\n\nEquations (1) and (2) imply that the transformation is a local isometry, i.e., it preserves the lengths of infinitesimal vectors. Equation (3) implies that the transformation is orthogonal, i.e., it preserves the angles between infinitesimal vectors. Finally, equation (4) relates the transformation to the original coordinates $(x, y)$.\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use the following ansatz for the functions $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$:\n$$f(x, y) = ax + by$$\n$$g(x, y) = cx + dy$$\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into equations (1)-(4), we obtain the following system of linear equations for the coefficients $a, b, c, d$:\n1. $a^2 + c^2 = 1$\n2. $b^2 + d^2 = 1$\n3. $ab + cd = 0$\n4. $(ax + by)(cx + dy)(ad - bc) = xy$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that the general solution is given by:\n$$f(x, y) = ax - by$$\n$$g(x, y) = bx + ay$$\nwhere $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ and $ad - bc = 1$. This means that the transformation is a combination of a rotation and a dilation.\n\nIn conclusion, the isometries of the given Riemannian metric $g$ are given by the transformations:\n$$x' = ax - by$$\n$$y' = bx + ay$$\nwhere $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ and $ad - bc = 1$."
