    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the critical points of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 7x + 2. We do this by taking the first derivative of f(x) and setting it equal to 0.\n\nf'(x) = 10x - 7\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n10x - 7 = 0\n10x = 7\nx = 7/10 = 0.7\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point satisfies the constraint g(x) = 2x + 1 ≥ 0.\n\ng(0.7) = 2(0.7) + 1 = 1.4 + 1 = 2.4\n\nSince g(0.7) = 2.4 ≥ 0, the constraint is satisfied. Now, we can find the maximum value of the function f(x) at this critical point:\n\nf(0.7) = 5(0.7)^2 - 7(0.7) + 2 = 5(0.49) - 4.9 + 2 = 2.45 - 4.9 + 2 = -0.45\n\nSo, the optimal solution is x = 0.7, and the maximum value of the function f(x) is -0.45."
