    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation:\n\nu_t = 2u_xx - uyy\n\nwhere u is a function of x, y and t. Assuming u(x,y,0) = sin(x)cos(y) and u(x,y,t) = 0 for all x,y > 0 and t > 0, find the solution u(x,y,t).",
    "message_2": "The given partial differential equation is a linear homogeneous equation, so we can use the method of separation of variables to solve it. Let's assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of three functions, one for each variable:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression into the given PDE:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = 2X''(x)Y(y)T(t) - X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = 2X''(x) / X(x) - Y''(y) / Y(y)\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on t, and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\n\n2X''(x) / X(x) - Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT'(t) = -λT(t)\n\n2X''(x) = λX(x)\n\nY''(y) = -2λY(y)\n\nLet's solve each ODE:\n\nFor T(t):\n\nT'(t) = -λT(t)\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-λt), where C is a constant.\n\nFor X(x):\n\n2X''(x) = λX(x)\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem. The general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√(λ/2)x) + B*sin(√(λ/2)x)\n\nFor Y(y):\n\nY''(y) = -2λY(y)\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nY(y) = D*cosh(√(2λ)y) + E*sinh(√(2λ)y)\n\nNow, we have:\n\nu(x, y, t) = (A*cos(√(λ/2)x) + B*sin(√(λ/2)x)) * (D*cosh(√(2λ)y) + E*sinh(√(2λ)y)) * Ce^(-λt)\n\nHowever, we are given that u(x, y, t) = 0 for all x, y > 0 and t > 0. This implies that B = D = 0, and we have:\n\nu(x, y, t) = A*cos(√(λ/2)x) * E*sinh(√(2λ)y) * Ce^(-λt)\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(x)cos(y). This means:\n\nsin(x)cos(y) = A*cos(√(λ/2)x) * E*sinh(√(2λ)y)\n\nTo satisfy this equation, we can choose λ = 2, A = 1, and E = 1. Therefore, the solution to the given PDE is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = cos(x) * sinh(y) * e^(-2t)"
