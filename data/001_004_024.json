    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 by factoring, we need to find two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to 5 (the coefficient of the linear term).\n\nThese two numbers are 2 and 3, since 2 * 3 = 6 and 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = 0\n\nNext, we can factor by grouping:\n\nx(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term (x + 2):\n\n(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0\n\nx = -2 or x = -3\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are x = -2 and x = -3."
