    "message_2": "To determine if the group G is isomorphic to C27 (the cyclic group of order 27) or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will analyze the given presentation.\n\nG = <a, b | a^9 = b^3 = 1, ba = a^4b>\n\nFirst, let's check if G is abelian. If G is abelian, then for all elements a and b in G, we have ab = ba. However, from the presentation, we have ba = a^4b, which is not equal to ab. Therefore, G is not abelian.\n\nSince G is not abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to C27, which is an abelian group.\n\nNow, let's check if G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27. The non-abelian group of order 27 is the Heisenberg group over the field with three elements, which has the presentation:\n\nH = <a, b, c | a^3 = b^3 = c^3 = 1, ca = ac, cb = bc, ab = bac>\n\nWe can rewrite the presentation of G as follows:\n\nG = <a, b, c | a^9 = b^3 = c^3 = 1, ca = ac, cb = bc, ba = a^4b, c = ab>\n\nNow, let's compare the presentations of G and H:\n\n1. Both G and H have three generators a, b, and c.\n2. Both G and H have a^9 = b^3 = c^3 = 1.\n3. Both G and H have ca = ac and cb = bc.\n4. G has ba = a^4b, while H has ab = bac. However, we can rewrite the relation in H as ba = a^4b by substituting c = ab in the relation ab = bac.\n\nSince the presentations of G and H are equivalent, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
