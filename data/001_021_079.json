    "message_2": "We can try to solve the polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 by factoring it. \n\nFirst, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, 6) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1). So, the possible rational roots are the factors of 6, which are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial:\n\n1. f(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0, so x = 1 is a root.\n\nNow that we found one root, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n1 |  1  -6  11  -6\n  |     1  -5   10\n  ----------------\n      1  -5   6   -4\n\nSo, the remaining quadratic factor is x^2 - 5x + 6. We can factor this further:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nNow we have factored the polynomial completely:\n\nx^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the real roots are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3."
