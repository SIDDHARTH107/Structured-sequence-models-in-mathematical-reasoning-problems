    "message_1": "A game involves rolling a fair six-sided die. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 at least once in three rolls of the die?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 at least once in three rolls, we can first find the probability of not rolling a number greater than 4 in all three rolls and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not rolling a number greater than 4 (i.e., rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4) in a single roll is 4/6, since there are 4 favorable outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n\nThe probability of not rolling a number greater than 4 in all three rolls is (4/6) * (4/6) * (4/6) = (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 8/27.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 at least once in three rolls:\n\n1 - 8/27 = 19/27.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 at least once in three rolls of the die is 19/27."
