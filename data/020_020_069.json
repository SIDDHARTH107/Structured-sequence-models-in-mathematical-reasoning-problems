    "message_1": "A car manufacturer is designing a new engine with three different types of cylinders: type A, type B and type C. Each type of cylinder costs $5, $7 and $9 respectively. The manufacturer wants to design an engine with a total volume of 8000 cubic centimeters, but wants to minimize the total cost of the cylinders used. The volume of each type of cylinder is as follows: type A- 100 cc, type B- 200 cc, and type C- 400 cc. What is the minimum cost of the cylinders required to design this engine?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of type A, type B, and type C cylinders as a, b, and c respectively. We want to minimize the total cost, which can be represented as:\n\nCost = 5a + 7b + 9c\n\nSubject to the constraint:\n\n100a + 200b + 400c = 8000\n\nWe can simplify the constraint equation by dividing by 100:\n\na + 2b + 4c = 80\n\nNow we need to find the values of a, b, and c that minimize the cost function while satisfying the constraint equation.\n\nFirst, let's try to express a in terms of b and c:\n\na = 80 - 2b - 4c\n\nNow substitute this expression for a into the cost function:\n\nCost = 5(80 - 2b - 4c) + 7b + 9c\nCost = 400 - 10b - 20c + 7b + 9c\nCost = 400 - 3b - 11c\n\nNow we need to find the values of b and c that minimize this cost function. Since a, b, and c are all non-negative integers (you can't have a negative or fractional number of cylinders), we can use trial and error to find the minimum cost.\n\nWe can start by setting b = 0 and finding the minimum cost for different values of c:\n\nIf c = 0, a = 80, b = 0, c = 0, Cost = 400\nIf c = 1, a = 76, b = 0, c = 1, Cost = 391\nIf c = 2, a = 72, b = 0, c = 2, Cost = 382\n...\n\nWe can see that the cost is decreasing as we increase c. Now let's try increasing b:\n\nIf b = 1, c = 0, a = 78, b = 1, c = 0, Cost = 397\nIf b = 1, c = 1, a = 74, b = 1, c = 1, Cost = 388\n...\n\nAgain, the cost is decreasing as we increase c. We can continue this process until we find the minimum cost. After trying different combinations of b and c, we find that the minimum cost occurs when b = 4 and c = 18:\n\na = 80 - 2(4) - 4(18) = 80 - 8 - 72 = 0\nb = 4\nc = 18\n\nSo the minimum cost configuration is 0 type A cylinders, 4 type B cylinders, and 18 type C cylinders. The total cost is:\n\nCost = 5(0) + 7(4) + 9(18) = 0 + 28 + 162 = $190\n\nTherefore, the minimum cost of the cylinders required to design this engine is $190."
