    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of the function $f(z) = z^3 - 6z^2 + 11z - 6$ on the closed disc $|z - 2i| \\leq 2$, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle. This principle states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) in a domain, then the maximum modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nThe function $f(z) = z^3 - 6z^2 + 11z - 6$ is a polynomial, so it is holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, we only need to consider the boundary of the closed disc $|z - 2i| = 2$.\n\nLet $z = 2i + re^{i\\theta}$, where $r = 2$ and $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, we can rewrite $f(z)$ in terms of $\\theta$:\n\n$$f(z) = (2i + 2e^{i\\theta})^3 - 6(2i + 2e^{i\\theta})^2 + 11(2i + 2e^{i\\theta}) - 6$$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum modulus of $f(z)$, which means we want to find the maximum and minimum of $|f(z)|$. To do this, we can find the critical points of $|f(z)|$ with respect to $\\theta$.\n\nLet $g(\\theta) = |f(2i + 2e^{i\\theta})|$. Then, we can find the critical points of $g(\\theta)$ by finding the points where $g'(\\theta) = 0$ or $g'(\\theta)$ is undefined. However, since $g(\\theta)$ is a continuous function, we only need to consider the points where $g'(\\theta) = 0$.\n\nTo find the critical points, we can use the polar form of the derivative:\n\n$$g'(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} |f(2i + 2e^{i\\theta})|$$\n\nCompute $g'(\\theta)$ and set it to zero. Then, solve for $\\theta$. The critical points will correspond to the maximum and minimum modulus of $f(z)$ on the boundary of the closed disc.\n\nFinally, evaluate $f(z)$ at the critical points and at the endpoints of the interval $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. The maximum and minimum modulus of $f(z)$ will be the maximum and minimum of the absolute values of these function values."
