We will find augmenting paths and update the residual graph until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Start with the initial flow of 0 on all edges.\n2. Find an augmenting path from node 1 to node 5. One possible path is 1-2-4-5 with a bottleneck capacity of 2 (the minimum capacity along the path).\n3. Update the residual graph by subtracting the bottleneck capacity from the forward edges and adding it to the reverse edges.\n4. Find another augmenting path from node 1 to node 5. One possible path is 1-3-4-5 with a bottleneck capacity of 3.\n5. Update the residual graph again by subtracting the bottleneck capacity from the forward edges and adding it to the reverse edges.\n6. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow from node 1 to node 5 is the sum of the bottleneck capacities found in the augmenting paths, which is 2 + 3 = 5."
