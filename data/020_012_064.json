    "message_1": "A farmer has a rectangular field with a length of 100 meters and a width of 50 meters. The farmer wants to fence off a rectangular area within the field to cultivate a garden. The fence will only be required on three sides since one side is the boundary of the field. What is the maximum area that can be enclosed by the fence?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the fence perpendicular to the boundary of the field, and y be the length of the fence parallel to the boundary of the field. Since the fence is only required on three sides, the total length of the fence is x + y + x = 2x + y.\n\nTo maximize the area enclosed by the fence, we need to find the maximum value of the product of x and y (A = xy), subject to the constraint that 2x + y is less than or equal to the total available fencing.\n\nIn this case, the farmer can use the entire boundary of the field as one side of the fence, so the maximum total length of the fence is 100 meters. Thus, we have the constraint:\n\n2x + y â‰¤ 100\n\nWe want to maximize A = xy, so we can rewrite the constraint equation in terms of y:\n\ny = 100 - 2x\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into the area equation:\n\nA = x(100 - 2x)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = 100 - 4x = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 25\n\nNow substitute this value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = 100 - 2(25) = 50\n\nSo the maximum area that can be enclosed by the fence is:\n\nA = x * y = 25 * 50 = 1250 square meters."
