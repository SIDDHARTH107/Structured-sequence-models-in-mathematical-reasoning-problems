    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node E, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (A) to 0 and the distances of all other nodes to infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (A at first) and mark it as visited.\n\n3. Update the distances of its neighboring unvisited nodes by adding the distance from the current node to the neighboring node. If the new distance is less than the current distance, update the distance.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (E) is visited.\n\nApplying the algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E}\n   Distances: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞, E=∞\n\n2. Visit node A (smallest distance is 0):\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E}\n   Distances: A=0, B=5, C=2, D=∞, E=∞\n\n3. Visit node C (smallest distance is 2):\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, D, E}\n   Distances: A=0, B=5, C=2, D=6, E=∞\n\n4. Visit node B (smallest distance is 5):\n   Unvisited nodes: {D, E}\n   Distances: A=0, B=5, C=2, D=6, E=9\n\n5. Visit node D (smallest distance is 6):\n   Unvisited nodes: {E}\n   Distances: A=0, B=5, C=2, D=6, E=8\n\n6. Visit node E (smallest distance is 8):\n   All nodes visited or target node visited.\n\nThe shortest path from node A to node E is A → C → D → E, and its total weight is 8."
