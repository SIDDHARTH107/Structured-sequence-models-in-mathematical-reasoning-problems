    "message_1": "Sure! Here's an example question related to Diophantine equations:\n\nFind all integer solutions to the equation:\n    \n    6x + 15y = 21\n\nwhere x and y are unknown integers.",
    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the equation by dividing all the coefficients by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3 in this case. So, we get:\n\n2x + 5y = 7\n\nNow, we will find a particular solution for this simplified equation. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients for the BÃ©zout's identity, which states that for any two integers a and b, there exist integers x and y such that:\n\nax + by = gcd(a, b)\n\nIn our case, a = 2 and b = 5. Since gcd(2, 5) = 1, we can rewrite the identity as:\n\n2x + 5y = 1\n\nNow, we can apply the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution for x and y:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (5) by the smaller number (2):\n   5 = 2 * 2 + 1\n\n2. Express the remainder (1) as a linear combination of 5 and 2:\n   1 = 5 - 2 * 2\n\nSo, we have found a particular solution: x = -2 and y = 1. Now, we can multiply this solution by 7 to find a particular solution for our original equation:\n\n2x + 5y = 7\n2(-2 * 7) + 5(1 * 7) = 7\n\nThis gives us x = -14 and y = 7 as a particular solution for the original equation.\n\nNow, we can use the general solution formula for Diophantine equations to find all integer solutions:\n\nx = x0 + (b / gcd(a, b)) * t\ny = y0 - (a / gcd(a, b)) * t\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solution we found (-14 and 7, respectively), a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the simplified equation (2 and 5), gcd(a, b) is their greatest common divisor (1), and t is an arbitrary integer.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nx = -14 + 5t\ny = 7 - 2t\n\nFor any integer value of t, this will give us an integer solution for the equation 6x + 15y = 21."
