    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method. First, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations.\n\nMultiply the first equation by 5 and the third equation by -2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 10x + 15y + 20z = 25 + 30i\n(2) -2x - 4y - 2z = -6 - 4i\n\nNow, add equations (1) and (2) to eliminate x:\n\n13y + 18z = 19 + 26i\n\nNow, we have a new system of equations:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 5 + 6i\n5x - 7y + 3z = -2 - 3i\n13y + 18z = 19 + 26i\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from the first and second equations. Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x equal:\n\n(1) 10x + 15y + 20z = 25 + 30i\n(2) 10x - 14y + 6z = -4 - 6i\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate x:\n\n29y + 14z = 29 + 36i\n\nNow, we have a new system of equations:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 5 + 6i\n13y + 18z = 19 + 26i\n29y + 14z = 29 + 36i\n\nNow, we will eliminate y from the second and third equations. Multiply the second equation by 29 and the third equation by 13 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(1) 377y + 522z = 551 + 754i\n(2) 377y + 182z = 377 + 468i\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate y:\n\n340z = 174 + 286i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 340:\n\nz = (174 + 286i) / 340\nz = 1/2 + (13/15)i\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find y:\n\n13y + 18(1/2 + (13/15)i) = 19 + 26i\n13y + 9 + 18(13/15)i = 19 + 26i\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n13y + 18(13/15)i = 10 + 26i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 13:\n\ny + (18/15)i = (10/13) + (2/13)i\n\nSubtract (18/15)i from both sides:\n\ny = (10/13) - (4/13)i\n\nNow that we have y, we can substitute y and z back into the first equation to find x:\n\n2x + 3((10/13) - (4/13)i) + 4(1/2 + (13/15)i) = 5 + 6i\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2x + (30/13) - (12/13)i + 2 + (52/15)i = 5 + 6i\n\nSubtract (30/13) and 2 from both sides:\n\n2x = (5/13) + (50/15)i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = (5/26) + (25/30)i\nx = (5/26) + (5/6)i\n\nNow we have the values of x, y, and z:\n\nx = (5/26) + (5/6)i\ny = (10/13) - (4/13)i\nz = 1/2 + (13/15)i"
