    "message_2": "To determine if a system of linear equations has no solutions, we can check if the equations are parallel (meaning they have the same slope but different y-intercepts). \n\nFirst, let's rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\nEquation 1: 2x - 3y = -7\n-3y = -2x - 7\ny = (2/3)x + 7/3\n\nEquation 2: 4x - 6y = 15\n-6y = -4x + 15\ny = (2/3)x - 5/2\n\nNow, we can see that both equations have the same slope (m = 2/3) but different y-intercepts (b1 = 7/3 and b2 = -5/2). Since they have the same slope and different y-intercepts, the two lines are parallel and will never intersect. Therefore, this system of linear equations has no solutions."
