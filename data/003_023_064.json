    "message_2": "To find the cross product of u and v, we can use the following formula:\n\nu x v = [ (u2 * v3 - u3 * v2), (u3 * v1 - u1 * v3), (u1 * v2 - u2 * v1) ]\n\nwhere u1, u2, u3 are the components of vector u, and v1, v2, v3 are the components of vector v.\n\nSo, u x v = [ (-2 * 2 - 4 * 5), (4 * (-1) - 3 * 2), (3 * 5 - (-2) * (-1)) ]\nu x v = [ (-4 - 20), (-4 - 6), (15 - 2) ]\nu x v = [ -24, -10, 13 ]\n\nNow, we have the cross product vector: w = [-24, -10, 13].\n\nTo find the magnitude of the cross product, we can use the formula:\n\n|w| = sqrt(w1^2 + w2^2 + w3^2)\n\n|w| = sqrt((-24)^2 + (-10)^2 + 13^2)\n|w| = sqrt(576 + 100 + 169)\n|w| = sqrt(845)\n\nThe magnitude of the cross product is |w| = sqrt(845).\n\nTo find the direction of the cross product, we can calculate the unit vector:\n\nunit vector = w / |w|\n\nunit vector = [ -24/sqrt(845), -10/sqrt(845), 13/sqrt(845) ]\n\nSo, the direction of the cross product is given by the unit vector [ -24/sqrt(845), -10/sqrt(845), 13/sqrt(845) ]."
