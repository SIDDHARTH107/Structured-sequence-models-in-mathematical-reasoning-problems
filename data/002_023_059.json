    "message_1": "A sphere has a radius of 5 cm. What is the surface area of the sphere?",
    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5^2)\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25\nSurface Area = 100π\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 square centimeters (using the value of π ≈ 3.1416)."
