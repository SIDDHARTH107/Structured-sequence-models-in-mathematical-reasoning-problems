    "message_2": "To show that the projective variety given by the equation x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0 in P^2 is birational to the affine variety given by the equation x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 in A^2, we need to find a birational map between these two varieties and its inverse.\n\nLet's consider the following map φ: A^2 → P^2, defined by:\n\nφ(x, y) = (x, y, 1)\n\nThe image of this map is a subset of the projective variety x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0, since for any (x, y) in A^2, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - 1^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0\n\nNow, let's find the inverse map φ^(-1): P^2 → A^2. Since we are working in projective space, we can consider the case where z ≠ 0. In this case, we can define the inverse map as:\n\nφ^(-1)(x, y, z) = (x/z, y/z)\n\nThis map is well-defined, as for any (x, y, z) in P^2 with z ≠ 0, we have:\n\n(x/z)^2 + (y/z)^2 - 1 = (x^2 + y^2 - z^2)/z^2 = 0\n\nThus, φ and φ^(-1) are inverse maps between the affine variety x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 in A^2 and the projective variety x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0 in P^2, showing that they are birationally equivalent."
