    "message_2": "In second-order logic, the cardinality of the power set of the set of natural numbers is not directly expressible as a specific cardinal number. Second-order logic allows quantification over sets and relations, which leads to a more expressive language than first-order logic. However, this expressiveness comes at the cost of losing some of the nice properties of first-order logic, such as the existence of a complete and sound proof system.\n\nIn first-order logic, the cardinality of the power set of the set of natural numbers is represented by the cardinality of the continuum, which is usually denoted as 2^ℵ₀ (2 raised to the power of aleph-null). Aleph-null is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, and the continuum hypothesis states that 2^ℵ₀ is equal to ℵ₁ (aleph-one), the next larger cardinal number.\n\nHowever, in second-order logic, we cannot directly express the cardinality of the power set of the set of natural numbers as a specific cardinal number like ℵ₁. Instead, we can only express properties and relationships involving sets and relations over the natural numbers. The cardinality of the power set of the set of natural numbers remains an abstract concept in second-order logic, and its exact value depends on the underlying set theory and model of the logic."
