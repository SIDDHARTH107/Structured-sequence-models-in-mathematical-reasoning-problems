Determine the number of linearly independent 1-forms $\\alpha$ on $M$ such that $\\alpha \\wedge \\omega$ is exact, i.e., there exists a smooth function $f$ on $M$ such that $\\alpha \\wedge \\omega = df$.",
    "message_2": "Let $\\alpha$ be a 1-form on $M$ such that $\\alpha \\wedge \\omega = df$ for some smooth function $f$ on $M$. Since $\\omega$ is a closed 2-form, we have $d\\omega = 0$. Now, we can take the exterior derivative of both sides of the equation $\\alpha \\wedge \\omega = df$:\n\n$$d(\\alpha \\wedge \\omega) = d(df).$$\n\nUsing the properties of the exterior derivative, we get:\n\n$$d\\alpha \\wedge \\omega + \\alpha \\wedge d\\omega = d^2f.$$\n\nSince $d\\omega = 0$ and $d^2f = 0$, this simplifies to:\n\n$$d\\alpha \\wedge \\omega = 0.$$\n\nNow, we want to determine the number of linearly independent 1-forms $\\alpha$ that satisfy this equation. Since $M$ has dimension 3, there are three linearly independent 1-forms in general. Let's denote them by $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$. We can write any 1-form $\\alpha$ as a linear combination of these basis 1-forms:\n\n$$\\alpha = a_1\\alpha_1 + a_2\\alpha_2 + a_3\\alpha_3,$$\n\nwhere $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are smooth functions on $M$. Substituting this expression for $\\alpha$ into the equation $d\\alpha \\wedge \\omega = 0$, we get:\n\n$$d(a_1\\alpha_1 + a_2\\alpha_2 + a_3\\alpha_3) \\wedge \\omega = 0.$$\n\nExpanding this equation using the linearity of the exterior derivative, we obtain:\n\n$$(a_1d\\alpha_1 + a_2d\\alpha_2 + a_3d\\alpha_3) \\wedge \\omega = 0.$$\n\nSince $\\omega$ is a non-zero closed 2-form, it has rank 2. Therefore, the only way for the above equation to hold is if $a_1d\\alpha_1 + a_2d\\alpha_2 + a_3d\\alpha_3 = 0$. This means that the 1-forms $d\\alpha_1, d\\alpha_2, d\\alpha_3$ are linearly dependent. In other words, there exists a non-trivial linear relation among them:\n\n$$c_1d\\alpha_1 + c_2d\\alpha_2 + c_3d\\alpha_3 = 0,$$\n\nwhere not all $c_i$ are zero. Without loss of generality, let's assume $c_1 \\neq 0$. Then we can express $d\\alpha_1$ as a linear combination of $d\\alpha_2$ and $d\\alpha_3$:\n\n$$d\\alpha_1 = -\\frac{c_2}{c_1}d\\alpha_2 - \\frac{c_3}{c_1}d\\alpha_3.$$\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n$$\\alpha_1 = -\\frac{c_2}{c_1}\\alpha_2 - \\frac{c_3}{c_1}\\alpha_3 + \\beta,$$\n\nwhere $\\beta$ is a closed 1-form. Thus, any 1-form $\\alpha$ satisfying the equation $d\\alpha \\wedge \\omega = 0$ can be written as a linear combination of $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$, and $\\beta$. Therefore, there are 2 linearly independent 1-forms $\\alpha$ on $M$ such that $\\alpha \\wedge \\omega$ is exact."
