    "message_1": "The following is a Prisoner's Dilemma problem for a math student to solve:\n\nTwo suspects, A and B, are arrested by the police. They are separated and cannot communicate with each other. The police offer each of them a deal: if one of them confesses and the other remains silent, the confessor will be given a reduced sentence of 2 years, while the silent one will get 10 years. If both confess, they will each get 5 years. But if both remain silent, they will each get only 1 year.\n\nWhat is the best strategy for A and B to maximize their combined chances of a shorter sentence, and what will the outcome be?",
    "message_2": "The best strategy for A and B to maximize their combined chances of a shorter sentence is for both of them to remain silent. This is because if both remain silent, they will each get only 1 year, which is the shortest possible sentence for both of them combined (1+1=2 years total).\n\nHowever, the Prisoner's Dilemma problem highlights the difficulty in achieving this outcome due to the lack of communication and trust between the two suspects. Each suspect might be tempted to confess, hoping to get the reduced sentence of 2 years if the other remains silent, but risking the 5-year sentence if both confess.\n\nIn an ideal situation where both suspects trust each other and prioritize minimizing their combined sentence, they would both remain silent and each get a 1-year sentence, resulting in a total of 2 years."
