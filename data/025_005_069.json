    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the algebraic variety V, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nThe defining equation is F(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3.\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2\n∂F/∂z = 3z^2\n\nA point (x, y, z) is singular if all three partial derivatives are zero at that point:\n\n3x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n3y^2 = 0 => y = 0\n3z^2 = 0 => z = 0\n\nThe only point that satisfies all three conditions is the origin (0, 0, 0). However, we need to check if this point lies on the variety V. Plugging the coordinates into the defining equation:\n\n0^3 + 0^3 + 0^3 = 0\n\nSince the equation holds true, the origin (0, 0, 0) is a singular point on the algebraic variety V defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0."
