    "message_1": "What is the probability that a network will be hit by a phishing attack at least once in a year, given that the historical data shows an average of 10 phishing attacks per year? Assume that the probability of a single phishing attack occurring on a particular day is 0.03.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which models the number of events (in this case, phishing attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (a year). The Poisson distribution is given by the formula:\n\nP(X=k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (phishing attacks), k is the desired number of events, λ is the average number of events (10 phishing attacks per year), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability that a network will be hit by a phishing attack at least once in a year, which is the complement of the probability that the network will not be hit by any phishing attacks in a year. So, we will calculate the probability of 0 phishing attacks and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X=0) = (10^0 * e^(-10)) / 0!\nP(X=0) = (1 * e^(-10)) / 1\nP(X=0) = e^(-10)\n\nNow, we find the complement:\n\nP(X≥1) = 1 - P(X=0)\nP(X≥1) = 1 - e^(-10)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X≥1) ≈ 1 - 0.0000454\nP(X≥1) ≈ 0.9999546\n\nSo, the probability that a network will be hit by a phishing attack at least once in a year is approximately 99.995%."
