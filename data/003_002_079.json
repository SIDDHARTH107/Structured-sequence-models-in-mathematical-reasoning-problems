    "message_2": "To find the value of sin(60°) using trigonometric ratios, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 right triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2, where the shortest side is opposite the 30° angle, the middle side is opposite the 60° angle, and the longest side is the hypotenuse.\n\nThe sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. So, for a 60° angle in a 30-60-90 triangle, we have:\n\nsin(60°) = (side opposite 60°) / (hypotenuse)\nsin(60°) = (√3) / 2\n\nTherefore, sin(60°) = √3/2."
