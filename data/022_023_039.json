    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(z) = 2cos(2z), we first need to find the Fourier coefficients. The Fourier series of a function f(z) can be represented as:\n\nf(z) = Σ [a_n * cos(nz) + b_n * sin(nz)]\n\nwhere a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 0 to infinity.\n\nFor a periodic function with period 2π, the Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(z) * cos(nz)] dz from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(z) * sin(nz)] dz from -π to π\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients for f(z) = 2cos(2z):\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[2cos(2z)] dz from -π to π\na_0 = (2/π) * [sin(2z)/2] from -π to π\na_0 = 0\n\nFor n ≥ 1:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[2cos(2z) * cos(nz)] dz from -π to π\na_n = (2/π) * [sin((n-2)z)/(n-2) + sin((n+2)z)/(n+2)] from -π to π\n\nSince sin(kπ) = 0 for any integer k, a_n = 0 for n ≠ 2.\n\nFor n = 2:\n\na_2 = (2/π) * [sin(0)/(-1) + sin(4π)/(3)] - [sin(0)/(-1) + sin(-4π)/(3)]\na_2 = (2/π) * [0 + 0] = 0\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[2cos(2z) * sin(nz)] dz from -π to π\nb_n = (2/π) * [(cos(2z) * sin(nz))/(n^2 - 4)] from -π to π\n\nSince cos(kπ) = 1 for even k and -1 for odd k, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(z) = 2cos(2z) is:\n\nf(z) = 2cos(2z)\n\nNow, let's show that the sum of the series converges uniformly to f(z) on the strip -π/2 < Im z < π/2.\n\nSince the Fourier series of f(z) is exactly equal to f(z), the sum of the series converges to f(z) for all z in the strip -π/2 < Im z < π/2. Moreover, the convergence is uniform because the difference between the partial sums of the Fourier series and f(z) is zero for all z in the strip, and the maximum difference is also zero."
