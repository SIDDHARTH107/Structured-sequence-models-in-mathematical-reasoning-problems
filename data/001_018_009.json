    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the logarithmic property:\n\nlog_b(a) - log_b(c) = log_b(a/c)\n\nSo, in our case:\n\nlog_2(8) - log_2(2) = log_2(8/2)\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction inside the logarithm:\n\nlog_2(4)\n\nSince 2^2 = 4, the logarithm evaluates to:\n\nlog_2(4) = 2"
