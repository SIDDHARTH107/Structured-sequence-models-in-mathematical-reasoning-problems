If the potential energy is zero within the boundaries of the box and inﬁnitely large outside the box, calculate the first four energy levels of this particle. (Hint: The wave function must be zero at the two boundaries of the box.)",
    "message_2": "For a particle in a one-dimensional box of width L (in this case, L = 1), the time-independent Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\n-(ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ(x) is the wave function, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nSince the potential energy is zero within the box and infinitely large outside the box, the wave function must be zero at the boundaries of the box (x = 0 and x = L). Therefore, we can assume the wave function has the form:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\nwhere A is a normalization constant and k is the wave number. The boundary conditions require that:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) = 0\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, the first boundary condition is satisfied. For the second boundary condition, sin(kL) = 0, which implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Thus, the wave number k = nπ/L.\n\nNow, we can relate the wave number k to the energy E using the Schrödinger equation:\n\nE = (ħ^2 * k^2) / (2m)\n\nSubstituting k = nπ/L, we get:\n\nE_n = (ħ^2 * (nπ/L)^2) / (2m)\n\nFor the first four energy levels, we have n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since L = 1, the energy levels are:\n\nE_1 = (ħ^2 * π^2) / (2m)\nE_2 = (4 * ħ^2 * π^2) / (2m)\nE_3 = (9 * ħ^2 * π^2) / (2m)\nE_4 = (16 * ħ^2 * π^2) / (2m)\n\nThese are the first four energy levels of a particle in a one-dimensional box with width 1 and potential energy zero within the boundaries."
