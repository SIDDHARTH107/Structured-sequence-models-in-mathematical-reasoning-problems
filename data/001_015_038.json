    "message_2": "To solve the equation $3^{2x} - 3^x = 54$, we can make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let $y = 3^x$. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$y^2 - y = 54$\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. To solve for $y$, we can rearrange the equation and make it equal to zero:\n\n$y^2 - y - 54 = 0$\n\nNext, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n$(y - 9)(y + 6) = 0$\n\nFrom this, we have two possible solutions for $y$:\n\n$y - 9 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 9$\n\n$y + 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = -6$\n\nHowever, since $y = 3^x$, $y$ must be positive. Therefore, we can discard the second solution and use the first one:\n\n$3^x = 9$\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can rewrite the equation using logarithms:\n\n$x = \\log_3{9}$\n\nSince $3^2 = 9$, we have:\n\n$x = 2$\n\nSo, the solution for the given equation is $x = 2$."
