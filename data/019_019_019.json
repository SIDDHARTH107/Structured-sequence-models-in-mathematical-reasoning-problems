    "message_2": "The concept of a number that cannot be computed by any algorithm is related to the idea of uncomputable numbers. Uncomputable numbers are real numbers that cannot be precisely calculated by any algorithm or Turing machine.\n\nHowever, it is not possible to identify a specific \"smallest\" uncomputable number, as uncomputable numbers are not necessarily ordered or countable. They exist within the continuum of real numbers, but we cannot point to a specific smallest one."
