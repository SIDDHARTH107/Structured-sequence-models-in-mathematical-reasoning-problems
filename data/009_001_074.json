Initially, there are 50 rabbits on the island.\n\nCalculate how long it will take for the rabbit population to reach 80% of the carrying capacity (i.e., the maximum population size the island can support) and what that maximum population size is. Round your answers to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the carrying capacity (K) of the island. The carrying capacity is the maximum population size that the island can support. In the logistic growth model, the carrying capacity is reached when the growth rate (dP/dt) is zero.\n\n0 = 0.1P(1 - P/100)\n\nTo find the carrying capacity, we need to find the value of P when the growth rate is zero. We can do this by setting the equation equal to zero and solving for P:\n\n0 = 0.1P(1 - P/100)\n0 = P(1 - P/100)\n\nSince P cannot be zero (there are rabbits on the island), we can divide both sides by P:\n\n0 = 1 - P/100\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\nP/100 = 1\nP = 100\n\nSo, the carrying capacity (K) of the island is 100 rabbits.\n\nNow, we need to find how long it will take for the rabbit population to reach 80% of the carrying capacity. 80% of the carrying capacity is:\n\n0.8 * 100 = 80 rabbits\n\nWe can rewrite the logistic growth model as:\n\ndP/dt = 0.1P(1 - P/K)\n\nNow, we need to solve this differential equation for t when P = 80. To do this, we can use separation of variables:\n\n(1/P(1 - P/K))dP = 0.1dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P(1 - P/K))dP = ∫0.1dt\n\nLet's make a substitution to simplify the integral on the left side. Let u = 1 - P/K:\n\ndu/dP = -1/K\ndP = -Kdu\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\n∫(1/Pu)(-Kdu) = ∫0.1dt\n\n-K∫(1/Pu)du = 0.1∫dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n-K(ln|P| - ln|u|) = 0.1t + C\n\nNow, substitute back for u:\n\n-K(ln|P| - ln|1 - P/K|) = 0.1t + C\n\nWe can use the initial condition P(0) = 50 to find the constant C:\n\n-K(ln|50| - ln|1 - 50/100|) = 0.1(0) + C\n\n-K(ln|50| - ln|1/2|) = C\n\nNow, we need to find the time t when P = 80:\n\n-K(ln|80| - ln|1 - 80/100|) = 0.1t + C\n\n-K(ln|80| - ln|1/5|) = 0.1t - K(ln|50| - ln|1/2|)\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\nt = (K(ln|80| - ln|1/5|) + K(ln|50| - ln|1/2|))/0.1\n\nt ≈ 14.47 years\n\nSo, it will take approximately 14.47 years for the rabbit population to reach 80% of the carrying capacity, which is 80 rabbits."
