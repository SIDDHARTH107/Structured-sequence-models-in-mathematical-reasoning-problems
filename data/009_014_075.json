    "message_1": "A population of rabbits grows according to a logistic growth model, with a carrying capacity of 250 and a growth rate of 0.02 per month. If the initial population is 100, find the population after 2 years.",
    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in months.\n\nIn this problem, we have K = 250, P0 = 100, r = 0.02, and t = 2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(24) = 250 / (1 + (250 - 100) / 100 * e^(-0.02*24))\n\nP(24) = 250 / (1 + 150/100 * e^(-0.48))\n\nP(24) = 250 / (1 + 1.5 * e^(-0.48))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-0.48) and then the population P(24):\n\ne^(-0.48) ≈ 0.618783391\n\n1.5 * e^(-0.48) ≈ 0.928175086\n\n1 + 1.5 * e^(-0.48) ≈ 1.928175086\n\nP(24) = 250 / 1.928175086 ≈ 129.566\n\nTherefore, the population of rabbits after 2 years is approximately 130."
