    "message_1": "Let f(z) be a meromorphic function on the complex plane. If f(z) has poles at z=1, z=2, and z=3, with respective orders of 2, 3, and 4, what is the order of the pole of 1/(f(z)+1) at z=3?",
    "message_2": "Since f(z) has a pole of order 4 at z=3, we can write f(z) in the form:\n\nf(z) = (z-3)^4 * g(z)\n\nwhere g(z) is a holomorphic function (analytic and non-zero) in a neighborhood of z=3.\n\nNow, consider the function h(z) = f(z) + 1. In a neighborhood of z=3, we have:\n\nh(z) = (z-3)^4 * g(z) + 1\n\nNotice that h(z) also has a pole at z=3, but its order might be different from f(z). To find the order of the pole of h(z) at z=3, we need to find the smallest integer k such that (z-3)^k * h(z) is holomorphic and non-zero at z=3.\n\nLet's try k=1:\n\n(z-3) * h(z) = (z-3)^5 * g(z) + (z-3)\n\nThis function still has a pole at z=3, so we need to try a higher value of k. Let's try k=2:\n\n(z-3)^2 * h(z) = (z-3)^6 * g(z) + (z-3)^2\n\nNow, this function is holomorphic and non-zero at z=3, so the order of the pole of h(z) at z=3 is 2.\n\nFinally, we want to find the order of the pole of 1/h(z) at z=3. Since h(z) has a pole of order 2 at z=3, 1/h(z) will have a zero of order 2 at z=3. Therefore, the order of the pole of 1/(f(z)+1) at z=3 is 2."
