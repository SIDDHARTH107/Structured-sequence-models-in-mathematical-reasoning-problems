    "message_2": "Let the smallest positive integer be x. We are given that x is divisible by 9 and leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 11. We can write these conditions as:\n\nx ≡ 0 (mod 9)\nx ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences. The theorem states that if m1 and m2 are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), then there exists a unique solution modulo m1 * m2 for the system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ a1 (mod m1)\nx ≡ a2 (mod m2)\n\nIn our case, m1 = 9 and m2 = 11, which are coprime since their greatest common divisor is 1. We are given a1 = 0 and a2 = 7.\n\nNow, we need to find two integers M1 and M2 such that:\n\nM1 ≡ 1 (mod m2)\nM1 ≡ 0 (mod m1)\n\nM2 ≡ 0 (mod m2)\nM2 ≡ 1 (mod m1)\n\nWe can choose M1 = 11 and M2 = 18, since:\n\n11 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n11 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\n\n18 ≡ 0 (mod 11)\n18 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n\nNow, we can find the solution x:\n\nx = a1 * M1 + a2 * M2\nx = 0 * 11 + 7 * 18\nx = 126\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 9 and leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 11 is 126."
