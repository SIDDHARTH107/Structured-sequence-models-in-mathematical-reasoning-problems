    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. In other words, an automorphism is a bijection f: V(G) â†’ V(G) such that (u, v) is an edge in G if and only if (f(u), f(v)) is an edge in G.\n\nLet's analyze the graph G:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is the only vertex of degree 2 that is connected to two vertices of degree 3 (vertices 2 and 3). Therefore, vertex 1 must be fixed in any automorphism.\n2. Vertices 2 and 3 are both of degree 3 and connected to vertex 1. Thus, they can be swapped in an automorphism.\n3. Vertex 4 is the only vertex of degree 3 that is connected to a vertex of degree 1 (vertex 5). Therefore, vertex 4 must be fixed in any automorphism.\n4. Vertex 5 is the only vertex of degree 1, so it must also be fixed in any automorphism.\n\nFrom the above observations, we can see that the only possible nontrivial automorphism is the one that swaps vertices 2 and 3 while keeping the other vertices fixed. This gives us two automorphisms: the identity automorphism (which keeps all vertices fixed) and the automorphism that swaps vertices 2 and 3.\n\nThus, the automorphism group of G is isomorphic to the group Z_2 (the cyclic group of order 2), and G has 2 automorphisms."
