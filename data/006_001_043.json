    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 6 heads, we can calculate the probabilities of getting exactly 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads, and then add them together.\n\nThe probability of getting exactly k heads in n flips is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of getting a head (0.5 for a fair coin), q is the probability of getting a tail (also 0.5 for a fair coin), and X is the random variable representing the number of heads.\n\nFor our problem, n = 10, p = 0.5, and q = 0.5.\n\n1. Probability of getting exactly 6 heads:\nP(X = 6) = (10C6) * (0.5^6) * (0.5^4)\nP(X = 6) = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625\nP(X = 6) = 0.205078125\n\n2. Probability of getting exactly 7 heads:\nP(X = 7) = (10C7) * (0.5^7) * (0.5^3)\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.0078125 * 0.125\nP(X = 7) = 0.1171875\n\n3. Probability of getting exactly 8 heads:\nP(X = 8) = (10C8) * (0.5^8) * (0.5^2)\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.00390625 * 0.25\nP(X = 8) = 0.0439453125\n\n4. Probability of getting exactly 9 heads:\nP(X = 9) = (10C9) * (0.5^9) * (0.5^1)\nP(X = 9) = 10 * 0.001953125 * 0.5\nP(X = 9) = 0.009765625\n\n5. Probability of getting exactly 10 heads:\nP(X = 10) = (10C10) * (0.5^10) * (0.5^0)\nP(X = 10) = 1 * 0.0009765625 * 1\nP(X = 10) = 0.0009765625\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of getting exactly 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads:\n\nP(X ≥ 6) = P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\nP(X ≥ 6) = 0.205078125 + 0.1171875 + 0.0439453125 + 0.009765625 + 0.0009765625\nP(X ≥ 6) ≈ 0.376953125\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 6 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin is approximately 0.377 or 37.7%."
