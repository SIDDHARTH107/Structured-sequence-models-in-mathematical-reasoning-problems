    "message_2": "We will use the Pigeonhole Principle to prove this statement. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes (boxes) and n+1 pigeons (items), then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this case, the pigeonholes are the three favorite colors (red, blue, and green), and the pigeons are the 6 people. We want to show that there must be at least one color that is the favorite of at least three people.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is no color that is the favorite of at least three people. This means that each color can be the favorite of at most two people. Since there are three colors, this would mean that there can be at most 3 * 2 = 6 people in the group.\n\nHowever, we are given that there are 6 people in the group. If each color is the favorite of exactly two people, then the group would be evenly divided among the three colors, with two people having each color as their favorite. But this contradicts our initial assumption that there is no color that is the favorite of at least three people.\n\nTherefore, our assumption must be false, and there must be at least one color that is the favorite of at least three people in the group."
