    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node 1 to node 5, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will iteratively find augmenting paths and update the residual graph until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initialize the flow in all edges to 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph. An augmenting path is a path from the source (node 1) to the sink (node 5) where the residual capacity of each edge is greater than 0. The residual capacity of an edge is the original capacity minus the current flow.\n\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path by the minimum residual capacity found in the path.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\n1. Initial flow: 0 for all edges.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path: 1-2-4-5 with residual capacities 10, 30, and 10.\n\n3. Update the flow: The minimum residual capacity is 10, so we update the flow along the path 1-2-4-5 by 10. The new flow values are: (1-2) 10, (2-4) 10, (4-5) 10, and the rest are 0.\n\n4. Find another augmenting path: 1-3-5 with residual capacities 20, 10.\n\n5. Update the flow: The minimum residual capacity is 10, so we update the flow along the path 1-3-5 by 10. The new flow values are: (1-2) 10, (1-3) 10, (2-4) 10, (4-5) 10, (3-5) 10, and the rest are 0.\n\n6. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow from node 1 to node 5 is the sum of the flow values of the edges leaving node 1, which is 10 + 10 = 20."
