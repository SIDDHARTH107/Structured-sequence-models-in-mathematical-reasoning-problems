    "message_1": "Suppose you are the principal of a company that hires an agent to complete a project. The cost of the project is $10,000 and the agent's effort affects the probability of success as follows: if the agent puts in low effort, the probability of success is 0.4; if the agent puts in high effort, the probability of success is 0.8. If the project is successful, you receive a profit of $20,000, but if it fails, you receive nothing. The agent's effort level is unobservable but you can offer a contract that specifies the payment the agent receives based on the outcome of the project. What payment contract should you offer the agent to ensure that they put forth high effort?",
    "message_2": "To ensure that the agent puts forth high effort, you need to offer a payment contract that makes the expected payoff from high effort greater than the expected payoff from low effort. Let's denote the payment for success as S and the payment for failure as F.\n\nThe expected payoff for the agent when putting in high effort is:\n0.8 * S + 0.2 * F\n\nThe expected payoff for the agent when putting in low effort is:\n0.4 * S + 0.6 * F\n\nTo incentivize high effort, the expected payoff from high effort should be greater than the expected payoff from low effort:\n0.8 * S + 0.2 * F > 0.4 * S + 0.6 * F\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n0.4 * S > 0.4 * F\n\nDividing both sides by 0.4, we get:\nS > F\n\nThis means that the payment for success (S) should be greater than the payment for failure (F). To minimize the cost, you can set F to 0 and choose an S that is greater than 0. However, you also need to ensure that the contract is profitable for you, the principal.\n\nIf the project is successful with high effort, your profit will be:\n$20,000 - S\n\nSince the cost of the project is $10,000, to ensure that you make a profit, you need to set S such that:\n$20,000 - S > $10,000\n\nSolving for S, we get:\nS < $10,000\n\nSo, you should offer a payment contract where the payment for success (S) is greater than 0 and less than $10,000, and the payment for failure (F) is 0. This will incentivize the agent to put forth high effort while ensuring that you make a profit."
