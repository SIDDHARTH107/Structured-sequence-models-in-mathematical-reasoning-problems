    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B, we need to show that every element in A and B is also an element of A ∪ B.\n\nBy definition, the union of two sets A and B (denoted as A ∪ B) is the set containing all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In other words, if x is an element of A ∪ B, then x must be an element of A or an element of B (or both).\n\nNow, let's find A ∪ B. We have:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 4, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A and B is also an element of A ∪ B:\n\nFor set A:\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor set B:\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element in A and B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B."
