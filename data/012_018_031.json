    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G = (V, E) is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. To determine the edge connectivity, we can use the following formula:\n\nEdge connectivity Î»(G) = min{d(u, v)}\n\nwhere d(u, v) is the minimum number of edges connecting any two vertices u and v in the graph.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges, we cannot determine its edge connectivity. The edge connectivity depends on how the vertices and edges are connected, not just the total number of vertices and edges."
