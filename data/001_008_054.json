    "message_2": "To solve the inequality, we first need to isolate x. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 2x from both sides of the inequality:\n   3 < 3x - 6\n\n2. Add 6 to both sides of the inequality:\n   9 < 3x\n\n3. Divide both sides of the inequality by 3:\n   3 < x\n\nNow, we can graph the solution on the number line. Since the inequality is \"3 < x\", we know that x is greater than 3. To represent this on the number line, we can place an open circle at 3 (since x cannot be equal to 3) and draw an arrow pointing to the right (indicating that x is greater than 3).\n\nHere's a representation of the solution on the number line:\n\n```\n<---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--->\n   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10\n          ( )\n```\n\nThe open circle at 3 and the arrow pointing to the right indicate that the solution to the inequality is x > 3."
