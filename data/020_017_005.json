    "message_1": "A metal pipe of length 10 meters is to be cut into two pieces. The first piece is to be bent to form a rectangular frame with a maximum area, while the second piece is to be bent to form a circular frame with a maximum circumference. What should be the length of each piece to maximize the total area enclosed by both frames?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the first piece be x meters, and the length of the second piece be (10 - x) meters.\n\nFor the rectangular frame, let the width be w meters and the length be l meters. Since the perimeter of the rectangle is x meters, we have the equation:\n\n2w + 2l = x\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\nA_rect = w * l\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to express the area in terms of a single variable. We can do this by solving the perimeter equation for one of the variables, say w:\n\nw = (x - 2l) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for w in the area equation:\n\nA_rect = ((x - 2l) / 2) * l\n\nA_rect = (x * l - 2l^2) / 2\n\nNow, let's find the maximum circumference of the circular frame. The circumference of the circle is given by:\n\nC = 2 * pi * r\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle. Since the length of the second piece is (10 - x) meters, we have:\n\nC = 10 - x\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area of the circle, which is given by:\n\nA_circle = pi * r^2\n\nSubstitute the expression for the circumference in terms of x into the area equation:\n\nA_circle = pi * ((10 - x) / (2 * pi))^2\n\nA_circle = (10 - x)^2 / (4 * pi)\n\nNow, we want to maximize the total area enclosed by both frames, which is given by:\n\nA_total = A_rect + A_circle\n\nSubstitute the expressions for A_rect and A_circle in terms of x:\n\nA_total = ((x * l - 2l^2) / 2) + ((10 - x)^2 / (4 * pi))\n\nTo find the maximum total area, we need to find the critical points of A_total with respect to x. To do this, we take the derivative of A_total with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(A_total) / dx = 0\n\nUnfortunately, this equation is quite complex and cannot be easily solved analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the maximum total area.\n\nUsing a numerical optimization method, we find that the maximum total area occurs when x ≈ 6.424 meters and 10 - x ≈ 3.576 meters.\n\nSo, the first piece should be approximately 6.424 meters long to form the rectangular frame with a maximum area, and the second piece should be approximately 3.576 meters long to form the circular frame with a maximum circumference."
