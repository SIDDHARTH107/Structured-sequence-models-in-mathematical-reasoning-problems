    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the function f(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 12x^2 + 5 over the interval [0, 2], we need to first find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^4 - 3x^3 - 12x^2 + 5)\n\nf'(x) = 8x^3 - 9x^2 - 24x\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n8x^3 - 9x^2 - 24x = 0\n\nx(8x^2 - 9x - 24) = 0\n\nx = 0 is one solution. Now, we need to find the other solutions by solving the quadratic equation:\n\n8x^2 - 9x - 24 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a:\n\nx = (9 ± √(81 + 768)) / 16\nx = (9 ± √849) / 16\n\nNow, we have three critical points: x = 0, x = (9 - √849) / 16, and x = (9 + √849) / 16. We need to check the value of the function at these points as well as at the endpoints of the interval [0, 2].\n\nf(0) = 5\nf((9 - √849) / 16) ≈ -15.27\nf((9 + √849) / 16) ≈ 6.77\nf(2) = 2(16) - 3(8) - 12(4) + 5 = -11\n\nThe global minimum of f(x) over the interval [0, 2] occurs at x ≈ (9 - √849) / 16, and the minimum value is approximately -15.27."
