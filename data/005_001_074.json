    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the weight of their cereal boxes is 32 ounces. A sample of 20 boxes was taken and weighed, and their weights (in ounces) are as follows: \n\n31.8, 32.1, 32.2, 31.9, 31.7, 31.8, 32.0, 31.6, 31.9, 32.1, 31.8, 32.3, 31.9, 31.7, 32.0, 31.9, 32.2, 32.1, 31.8, 32.0 \n\nIs there sufficient evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is sufficient evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 0.05, we will perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the sample mean (x̄) and the sample standard deviation (s).\n\nSample mean (x̄) = (Σx) / n\nx̄ = (31.8 + 32.1 + 32.2 + 31.9 + 31.7 + 31.8 + 32.0 + 31.6 + 31.9 + 32.1 + 31.8 + 32.3 + 31.9 + 31.7 + 32.0 + 31.9 + 32.2 + 32.1 + 31.8 + 32.0) / 20\nx̄ = 638.1 / 20\nx̄ = 31.905\n\nNow, we need to calculate the sample standard deviation (s):\n\ns = √(Σ(x - x̄)² / (n - 1))\ns = √((0.105² + 0.195² + 0.295² + 0.005² + 0.205² + 0.105² + 0.095² + 0.305² + 0.005² + 0.195² + 0.105² + 0.395² + 0.005² + 0.205² + 0.095² + 0.005² + 0.295² + 0.195² + 0.105² + 0.095²) / (20 - 1))\ns = √(0.011025 + 0.038025 + 0.087225 + 0.000025 + 0.042025 + 0.011025 + 0.009025 + 0.093025 + 0.000025 + 0.038025 + 0.011025 + 0.156025 + 0.000025 + 0.042025 + 0.009025 + 0.000025 + 0.087225 + 0.038025 + 0.011025 + 0.009025) / 19\ns = √(0.7065 / 19)\ns = √0.037184\ns ≈ 0.1928\n\nNow, we can calculate the t-statistic:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\nt = (31.905 - 32) / (0.1928 / √20)\nt = -0.095 / (0.1928 / 4.4721)\nt = -0.095 / 0.0431\nt ≈ -2.202\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 19 degrees of freedom (n - 1). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.093.\n\nSince our calculated t-statistic (-2.202) is less than the critical t-value (-2.093), we reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the manufacturer's claim of 32 ounces is not accurate."
