    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from the original structure. In each iteration, the number of cubes removed is based on the following pattern:\n\n1. In the first iteration, 20 cubes remain (27 - 7, as 7 cubes are removed from the original 27).\n2. In the second iteration, each of the 20 remaining cubes undergoes the same process, leaving 20 * (20) = 400 cubes.\n3. In the third iteration, each of the 400 remaining cubes undergoes the same process, leaving 20 * (400) = 8000 cubes.\n\nSo, the total number of cells in the 3rd iteration of a Menger sponge is 8000."
