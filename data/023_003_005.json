    "message_1": "A heat equation in one dimension has the following form: \n\nu_t = k * u_xx \n\nwhere u is the temperature, t is time, x is position, and k is the thermal diffusivity coefficient. \n\nSuppose a thin rod with length L = 2 meters is initially at a uniform temperature of 20°C. The left end of the rod is kept at a constant temperature of 50°C, while the right end is insulated, meaning no heat can escape through it. Use Fourier series to find the temperature distribution of the rod for t > 0, if the thermal diffusivity coefficient is k = 0.5 m^2/s. Given that the rod was initially at a temperature of 20°C, what is the temperature at the midpoint of the rod at time t = 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the temperature distribution u(x, t) of the rod for t > 0. Since the left end of the rod is kept at a constant temperature of 50°C, we have the boundary condition:\n\nu(0, t) = 50\n\nSince the right end is insulated, we have the boundary condition:\n\nu_x(L, t) = 0\n\nThe initial temperature of the rod is 20°C, so we have the initial condition:\n\nu(x, 0) = 20\n\nNow, we can use the method of separation of variables to solve the heat equation. Let u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = k * X''(x)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by k * X(x)T(t), we get:\n\nT'(t) / (k * T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / (k * T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nT'(t) + kλT(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\nX(x) = A * cos(√λ * x) + B * sin(√λ * x)\n\nApplying the boundary condition u_x(L, t) = 0, we get:\n\n-2 * A * √λ * sin(√λ * L) = 0\n\nSince L = 2, we have:\n\n-2 * A * √λ * sin(√λ * 2) = 0\n\nFor non-trivial solutions, sin(√λ * 2) ≠ 0, so we must have:\n\n√λ * 2 = n * π, where n is a positive integer.\n\nThus, λ_n = (n * π / 2)^2, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n\nX_n(x) = cos(n * π * x / 2)\n\nNow, solving the second equation, we get:\n\nT'(t) + k * λ_n * T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n * exp(-k * λ_n * t)\n\nThe general solution of the heat equation is:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [C_n * cos(n * π * x / 2) * exp(-k * λ_n * t)]\n\nApplying the boundary condition u(0, t) = 50, we get:\n\n50 = Σ [C_n * exp(-k * λ_n * t)]\n\nSince this must hold for all t, we have:\n\nC_n = 50 / cos(n * π / 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients C_n that satisfy the initial condition u(x, 0) = 20:\n\n20 = Σ [C_n * cos(n * π * x / 2)]\n\nWe can use the orthogonality property of the cosine functions to find C_n:\n\nC_n = (2 / L) * ∫[0, L] (20 * cos(n * π * x / 2)) dx\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nC_n = (2 / 2) * (40 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we have the temperature distribution:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(40 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * cos(n * π * x / 2) * exp(-k * λ_n * t)]\n\nTo find the temperature at the midpoint of the rod (x = L / 2 = 1) at time t = 10 seconds, we plug in x = 1 and t = 10:\n\nu(1, 10) = Σ [(40 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * cos(n * π / 2) * exp(-0.5 * (n * π / 2)^2 * 10)]\n\nThis is an infinite series, so we need to approximate the sum by taking a finite number of terms. Taking the first 100 terms should give a reasonable approximation:\n\nu(1, 10) ≈ Σ[1 to 100] [(40 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * cos(n * π / 2) * exp(-0.5 * (n * π / 2)^2 * 10)]\n\nComputing this sum, we get:\n\nu(1, 10) ≈ 34.67°C\n\nSo, the temperature at the midpoint of the rod at time t = 10 seconds is approximately 34.67°C."
