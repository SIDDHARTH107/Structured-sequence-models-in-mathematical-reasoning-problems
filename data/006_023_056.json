The probability of a customer buying product A is 0.3, the probability of buying product B is 0.5, and the probability of buying product C is 0.2. \n\nWhat is the probability that a customer will buy:\n\na) product A or product B?\nb) product A and product B?\nc) at least one of the products? \nd) none of the products?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the probability of a customer buying product A or product B, we simply add the probabilities of each event occurring:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8\n\nb) Since the customer can only buy one product at a time, the probability of buying product A and product B at the same time is 0:\n\nP(A and B) = 0\n\nc) The probability of a customer buying at least one of the products is the sum of the probabilities of buying each product:\n\nP(at least one product) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 1\n\nd) The probability of a customer buying none of the products is the complement of the probability of buying at least one product:\n\nP(none) = 1 - P(at least one product) = 1 - 1 = 0"
