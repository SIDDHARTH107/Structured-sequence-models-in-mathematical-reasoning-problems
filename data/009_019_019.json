    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in Stochastic Differential Equations:\n\nA particle moves according to the following equation: \n\n$dx_t = -x_t dt + \\sqrt{1+x_t^2} dW_t$\n\nwhere $W_t$ is a Wiener process. Find the mean and variance of $x_t$ for $t \\geq 0$ if $x_0=0$.\n\nGood luck solving the problem!",
    "message_2": "To find the mean and variance of $x_t$, we first need to find the expected value and second moment of $x_t$. Let's denote the expected value as $E[x_t]$ and the second moment as $E[x_t^2]$.\n\nSince $x_0 = 0$, we have:\n\n$E[x_0] = 0$\n\n$E[x_0^2] = 0$\n\nNow, let's differentiate the expected value and second moment with respect to time $t$:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt} E[x_t] = E\\left[\\frac{d}{dt} x_t\\right]$\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt} E[x_t^2] = E\\left[\\frac{d}{dt} x_t^2\\right]$\n\nUsing Ito's lemma, we can find the differential of $x_t^2$:\n\n$d(x_t^2) = 2x_t dx_t + (1+x_t^2) dt$\n\nNow, let's substitute the given stochastic differential equation for $dx_t$:\n\n$d(x_t^2) = 2x_t(-x_t dt + \\sqrt{1+x_t^2} dW_t) + (1+x_t^2) dt$\n\nTaking the expected value of both sides:\n\n$E[d(x_t^2)] = E[2x_t(-x_t dt + \\sqrt{1+x_t^2} dW_t) + (1+x_t^2) dt]$\n\nSince the expected value of $dW_t$ is zero, we have:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt} E[x_t^2] = E[-2x_t^2 + (1+x_t^2)]$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the expected value and second moment:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt} E[x_t] = -E[x_t]$\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt} E[x_t^2] = -E[2x_t^2] + E[1+x_t^2]$\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\n$E[x_t] = E[x_0] e^{-t} = 0$\n\nSince $E[x_t] = 0$, the second ODE becomes:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt} E[x_t^2] = -E[x_t^2] + E[1]$\n\nSolving this ODE, we get:\n\n$E[x_t^2] = 1 - e^{-2t}$\n\nNow, we can find the variance of $x_t$:\n\n$Var[x_t] = E[x_t^2] - (E[x_t])^2 = 1 - e^{-2t}$\n\nSo, the mean and variance of $x_t$ are:\n\nMean: $E[x_t] = 0$\n\nVariance: $Var[x_t] = 1 - e^{-2t}$"
