    "message_2": "To find the number of triangles in the graph G, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nNow, let's consider a triangle in the graph. Each triangle contributes 3 edges and 6 to the sum of degrees (since each vertex in the triangle has a degree of 2). Therefore, if we let T be the number of triangles in the graph, we have:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) = 6 * T\n\nSince we know that Σ(deg(v)) = 24, we can solve for T:\n\n24 = 6 * T\nT = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 triangles in the graph G."
