    "message_2": "To find the mirror symmetric of the algebraic curve represented by the equation y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 3 with respect to the y-axis, we need to replace x with -x in the equation and simplify.\n\nSo, let's replace x with -x:\n\ny = (-x)^3 + 2(-x)^2 - 5(-x) + 3\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\ny = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x + 3\n\nThis is the equation of the mirror symmetric of the given algebraic curve with respect to the y-axis."
