In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:\n\n    4x + 6y = 14\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n    4x + 6y = 14\n    4x + 6y = 10\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n    (4x + 6y) - (4x + 6y) = 14 - 10\n    0 = 4\n\nSince we got a false statement (0 â‰  4), this means that the system of linear equations has no solution."
