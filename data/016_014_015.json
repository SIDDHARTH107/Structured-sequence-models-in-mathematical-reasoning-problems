    "message_1": "What is the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve?\n\nNote: The Lévy C curve is a self-similar curve, and the Hausdorff dimension is a way of measuring the \"fractality\" of a curve. This question requires the student to use their understanding of fractal geometry and apply it to the specific case of the Lévy C curve.",
    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-similar curve, meaning it can be divided into smaller copies of itself. To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, it can be divided into 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), each of which is scaled down by a factor of √2 (s = √2).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Lévy C curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(√2) ≈ 2 / 0.5 = 4\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 4."
