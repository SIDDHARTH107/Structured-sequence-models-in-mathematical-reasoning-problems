    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the canonical divisor of the given variety using Mori theory, we first need to compute the anticanonical class of the variety. The anticanonical class is given by the sum of the canonical class and the class of the hyperplane section.\n\nLet $X$ be the variety given by the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3=3xyz$ in projective space $\\mathbb{P}^2$. The canonical class of $X$ is given by $K_X = (n-1)H$, where $n$ is the dimension of the projective space and $H$ is the class of the hyperplane section. In this case, $n=2$, so $K_X = H$.\n\nNow, let's compute the class of the hyperplane section. The degree of the given equation is $3$, so the class of the hyperplane section is $3H$. Therefore, the anticanonical class of $X$ is given by $-K_X = 3H - H = 2H$.\n\nTo compute the degree of the canonical divisor, we need to compute the intersection number of the canonical class with itself. In this case, we have:\n\n$K_X \\cdot K_X = H \\cdot H = 1$.\n\nSo, the degree of the canonical divisor of the variety given by the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3=3xyz$ in projective space $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is $1$."
