    "message_2": "The Maximum Modulus Principle states that if a function is holomorphic (analytic) inside and on a closed bounded region, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the region.\n\nIn this case, the function $f(z) = z^2 + z + 1$ is an entire function, which means it is holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. We are interested in the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ for $|z| \\leqslant 1$. This is a closed bounded region, so we can apply the Maximum Modulus Principle.\n\nThe boundary of the region is the circle $|z| = 1$. We can parameterize this circle using $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{2i\\theta} + e^{i\\theta} + 1$$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of $|f(e^{i\\theta})|$:\n\n$$|f(e^{i\\theta})| = |e^{2i\\theta} + e^{i\\theta} + 1|$$\n\nTo find the maximum value, we can use the triangle inequality:\n\n$$|f(e^{i\\theta})| \\leq |e^{2i\\theta}| + |e^{i\\theta}| + |1| = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$\n\nNow, we need to find if there exists a $\\theta$ such that the inequality becomes an equality. Let's consider the case when $\\theta = \\pi$. In this case, we have:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\pi}) = e^{2i\\pi} + e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1$$\n\nThis is not the maximum value we found using the triangle inequality. However, we can consider the case when $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. In this case, we have:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}) = e^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} + e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} + 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 = 1$$\n\nAgain, this is not the maximum value we found using the triangle inequality. However, we can consider the case when $\\theta = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$. In this case, we have:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}}) = e^{i\\frac{8\\pi}{3}} + e^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} + 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 = 1$$\n\nAgain, this is not the maximum value we found using the triangle inequality. However, since the function is continuous, there must exist a $\\theta$ such that the maximum value of $|f(e^{i\\theta})|$ is attained. Therefore, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ for $|z| \\leqslant 1$ is $3$."
