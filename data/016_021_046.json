    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly replacing the middle third of each line segment with two segments that form an equilateral triangle with the removed segment. \n\nFor the first iteration, the original triangle has a perimeter of 3 units (since each side is 1 unit). In the first iteration, each side is replaced by two segments, each of length 1/3, so the new perimeter is 3 * (2 * 1/3) = 2 units.\n\nIn each subsequent iteration, the length of each segment is divided by 3, and the number of segments is doubled. Therefore, the perimeter of the nth iteration is given by the formula:\n\nP(n) = 2 * (2/3)^n\n\nFor the fourth iteration, we have:\n\nP(4) = 2 * (2/3)^4\nP(4) = 2 * (16/81)\nP(4) = 32/81\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fourth iteration of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is 32/81 units."
