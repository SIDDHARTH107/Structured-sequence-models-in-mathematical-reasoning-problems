If the group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, write down the number of reflections and rotations this group has. Finally, if the group is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20, write down at least one element in this group that does not commute with another element.",
    "message_2": "1. If the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, a generator for this group is an element of order 20. Let's denote this generator as g. Then, g^20 = e (identity element), and g^k ≠ e for 0 < k < 20.\n\n2. If the group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, it has 10 rotations and 10 reflections. The dihedral group D10 consists of 10 rotations (including the identity rotation) and 10 reflections, making a total of 20 elements.\n\n3. If the group is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 20, then there must be at least one element in this group that does not commute with another element. Let's denote these two elements as a and b, where a ≠ e and b ≠ e (e is the identity element). Then, for the group to be non-abelian, we must have ab ≠ ba."
