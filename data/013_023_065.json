Player 2 receives the amount x and must choose how much, y, to send back to Player 1. The final payoffs are calculated as follows: \n\n- If Player 1 sends $x and Player 2 sends back $y, then Player 1 receives $20-x+y and Player 2 receives $x-y.\n- If Player 1 sends nothing, then both players receive $0.\n\nAssume that Player 1 decides to send $5 to Player 2. What is the optimal amount, y, that Player 2 should send back to Player 1 in order to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "To maximize Player 2's payoff, we need to find the value of y that maximizes the expression for Player 2's payoff, which is $x-y$. In this case, x = $5.\n\nPlayer 2's payoff = $5 - y\n\nTo maximize this expression, Player 2 should minimize the value of y. Since the minimum amount Player 2 can send back is $0, the optimal amount for Player 2 to send back is $0.\n\nIn this case, Player 1's payoff would be $20 - $5 + $0 = $15, and Player 2's payoff would be $5 - $0 = $5."
