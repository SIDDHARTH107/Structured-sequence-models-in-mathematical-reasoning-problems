    "message_2": "Since the integral of $\\omega$ over any closed curve in $M$ is zero, we have that $\\omega$ is exact. To see this, let $\\gamma: [0,1] \\rightarrow M$ be a smooth curve with $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1) = p$, for some point $p \\in M$. Then, by Stokes' theorem, we have\n\n$$\\int_{\\gamma} \\omega = \\int_{\\partial \\gamma} f = f(p) - f(p) = 0,$$\n\nwhere $f: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function. This holds for any closed curve $\\gamma$ in $M$.\n\nNow, fix a point $p_0 \\in M$. For any other point $p \\in M$, choose a smooth curve $\\gamma_p : [0,1] \\rightarrow M$ such that $\\gamma_p(0) = p_0$ and $\\gamma_p(1) = p$. Define a function $f: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by\n\n$$f(p) = \\int_{\\gamma_p} \\omega.$$\n\nWe want to show that $\\omega = df$. To do this, we will show that for any smooth vector field $X$ on $M$, we have\n\n$$\\omega(X) = df(X).$$\n\nLet $X$ be a smooth vector field on $M$. Then, for any point $p \\in M$, we have\n\n$$df(X)(p) = X_p f = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(\\gamma_p(t)) - f(\\gamma_p(0))}{t},$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma_p$ is the integral curve of $X$ starting at $p$. Now, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have\n\n$$f(\\gamma_p(t)) - f(\\gamma_p(0)) = \\int_{\\gamma_p|_{[0,t]}} \\omega,$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma_p|_{[0,t]}$ is the restriction of $\\gamma_p$ to the interval $[0,t]$. Thus,\n\n$$df(X)(p) = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\int_{\\gamma_p|_{[0,t]}} \\omega}{t} = \\omega(X)(p),$$\n\nwhere the last equality follows from the definition of the action of a 1-form on a vector field. Therefore, we have shown that $\\omega = df$, as desired."
