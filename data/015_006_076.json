    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of intersections between the graph of the Hénon map function (x, y) -> (1 - ay^2 + bx, x) and a vertical line x = k, we need to analyze the equation of the Hénon map function.\n\nGiven the Hénon map function:\n\nx' = 1 - ay^2 + bx\ny' = x\n\nwhere a = 1.4 and b = 0.3.\n\nNow, we want to find the intersections with the vertical line x = k, where k varies from -2 to 2. To do this, we can set x' = k and solve for y:\n\nk = 1 - 1.4y^2 + 0.3x\n\nSince y' = x, we can substitute x with y':\n\nk = 1 - 1.4y^2 + 0.3y'\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of intersections by analyzing the equation. The equation is a quadratic equation in y^2:\n\n1.4y^2 - 0.3y' + (k - 1) = 0\n\nTo find the maximum number of intersections, we need to find the maximum number of real roots for this quadratic equation. The discriminant (Δ) of a quadratic equation determines the nature of its roots:\n\nΔ = b^2 - 4ac\n\nIn our case, a = 1.4, b = -0.3, and c = (k - 1). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula:\n\nΔ = (-0.3)^2 - 4(1.4)(k - 1)\n\nFor a quadratic equation to have real roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to 0:\n\nΔ ≥ 0\n\n(-0.3)^2 - 4(1.4)(k - 1) ≥ 0\n\nNow, we need to find the range of k values that satisfy this inequality. First, let's simplify the inequality:\n\n0.09 - 5.6k + 5.6 ≥ 0\n\n5.6k ≤ 5.51\n\nk ≤ 0.9839\n\nSince k varies from -2 to 2, the range of k values that satisfy the inequality is -2 ≤ k ≤ 0.9839. In this range, the quadratic equation will have 2 real roots, which means there will be 2 intersections between the Hénon map function and the vertical line x = k.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of intersections between the graph of the Hénon map function and a vertical line x = k, where k varies from -2 to 2, is 2."
