    "message_1": "Suppose that you have a region in the complex plane given by the unit disk $D=\\{ z\\in\\mathbb{C} : |z|<1\\}$, and a region $U$ that is biholomorphic to $D$ via a function $f: U\\rightarrow D$ which satisfies $f(0) = 0$. If the function $f$ can be analytically continued to a neighborhood of the closure of $U$, what is the value of $f\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$?",
    "message_2": "Since $f: U \\rightarrow D$ is a biholomorphism, there exists an inverse function $f^{-1}: D \\rightarrow U$ which is also holomorphic. We are given that $f(0) = 0$, so $f^{-1}(0) = 0$. \n\nNow, consider the point $z = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. We want to find the value of $f\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$. However, we are not given any information about the region $U$ or the function $f$ that would allow us to directly compute this value.\n\nSince $f$ is a biholomorphism, it preserves the property of being within the unit disk. In other words, if $|z| < 1$ in the region $U$, then $|f(z)| < 1$ in the region $D$. However, the point $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ has a magnitude of $|\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.87 < 1$. Therefore, without more information about the region $U$ or the function $f$, we cannot determine the exact value of $f\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$. We can only conclude that $|f\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)| < 1$."
