    "message_1": "Let A = {2, 3, 5} and B = {3, 5, 7}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B and then find the symmetric differences A △ B and B △ A. Show that A △ B is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 7)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric differences A △ B and B △ A. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 3, 5, 7} - {3, 5} = {2, 7}\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {3, 5, 7, 2} - {3, 5} = {2, 7}\n\nNotice that A △ B = B △ A = {2, 7}, which means the symmetric difference is commutative.\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of A △ B and B △ A.\n\n(A △ B) x (B △ A) = {(2, 2), (2, 7), (7, 2), (7, 7)}\n\nSince A △ B = B △ A, the Cartesian product (A △ B) x (B △ A) is the same as (B △ A) x (A △ B). Therefore, the Cartesian product is commutative for the symmetric difference in this case.\n\nHowever, the question asks to show that A △ B is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product. This statement is incorrect, as we have just demonstrated that the Cartesian product is commutative for the symmetric difference in this specific case. It is important to note that this result may not hold for all sets A and B, and the commutativity of the Cartesian product with respect to the symmetric difference should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis."
