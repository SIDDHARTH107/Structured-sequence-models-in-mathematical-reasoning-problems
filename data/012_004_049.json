    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we will start with an arbitrary vertex and then iteratively add the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex not in the tree. We will continue this process until all vertices are included in the tree.\n\nLet's start with vertex A:\n\n1. Add vertex A to the tree.\n2. The smallest edge connected to A is (A, D) with weight 1. Add edge (A, D) to the tree.\n3. Now, the tree contains vertices A and D. The smallest edge connected to either A or D is (D, E) with weight 2. Add edge (D, E) to the tree.\n4. The tree now contains vertices A, D, and E. The smallest edge connected to A, D, or E is (A, B) with weight 3. Add edge (A, B) to the tree.\n5. The tree now contains vertices A, B, D, and E. The smallest edge connected to A, B, D, or E is (E, F) with weight 5. Add edge (E, F) to the tree.\n6. The tree now contains vertices A, B, D, E, and F. The smallest edge connected to A, B, D, E, or F is (B, C) with weight 6. Add edge (B, C) to the tree.\n\nNow, all vertices are included in the tree, and the minimum spanning tree is complete. The minimum spanning tree contains the edges (A, D), (D, E), (A, B), (E, F), and (B, C).\n\nTo calculate the total weight of the minimum spanning tree, we sum the weights of the edges:\n\n1 (A, D) + 2 (D, E) + 3 (A, B) + 5 (E, F) + 6 (B, C) = 17\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 17."
