    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 4sin(x) + 3cos(x) for x between 0 and 2π, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\n√(a^2 + b^2) = √(4^2 + 3^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n\nThe maximum value of the function f(x) = 4sin(x) + 3cos(x) for x between 0 and 2π is 5."
