    "message_2": "The given graph is an absolute value graph with a vertex at (-2, 0) and opens upwards. The general equation for an absolute value graph is:\n\ny = a|x - h| + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the graph and a determines the direction and steepness of the graph. Since the graph opens upwards, a > 0.\n\nGiven the vertex (-2, 0), we can substitute h = -2 and k = 0 into the equation:\n\ny = a|x - (-2)| + 0\ny = a|x + 2|\n\nNow, we need to determine the value of a. Since we don't have any other specific points on the graph, we cannot find the exact value of a. However, we can write the equation in terms of a:\n\ny = a|x + 2|"
