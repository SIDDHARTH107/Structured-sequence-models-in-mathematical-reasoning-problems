    "message_2": "To find the closure of the set A = [0, 1/2) in X, we need to find the smallest closed set containing A. Recall that the closure of a set A is the union of A and its limit points.\n\nFirst, let's find the limit points of A. A point x in X is a limit point of A if every open set containing x intersects A in a point different from x.\n\nFor x in [0, 1/2), every open set containing x will have a non-empty intersection with A, since the basis elements in B containing x will also contain other points in A. Thus, all points in [0, 1/2) are limit points of A.\n\nNow, let's consider the point 1/2. The basis element [0, 1) contains 1/2, and its intersection with A is [0, 1/2), which is non-empty. Thus, 1/2 is also a limit point of A.\n\nFor any point x in (1/2, 1), there exists a basis element [0, 1) containing x, but its intersection with A is [0, 1/2), which does not contain x. Therefore, no point in (1/2, 1) is a limit point of A.\n\nSimilarly, no point in (1, 2] is a limit point of A, since the basis element (1, 2] does not intersect A at all.\n\nSo, the limit points of A are [0, 1/2] and the closure of A is the union of A and its limit points, which is [0, 1/2]."
