    "message_1": "Suppose that you are given the following premises:\n\nPremise 1: All dogs have four legs.\nPremise 2: Fido is a dog.\nPremise 3: Fido is missing one leg.\n\nIs it true or false that Fido has four legs? Justify your answer using non-monotonic logic.",
    "message_2": "Using non-monotonic logic, we can revise our beliefs when new information is presented. In this case, we initially believe that all dogs have four legs, and Fido is a dog. However, when we learn that Fido is missing one leg, we need to revise our belief about Fido's number of legs.\n\nNon-monotonic logic allows us to handle exceptions to general rules, like Premise 1. Given the new information in Premise 3, we can conclude that Fido does not have four legs. Instead, Fido has three legs, as he is missing one leg. Therefore, it is false that Fido has four legs."
