Use the cuckoo search algorithm to find the minimum cost and the corresponding production quantity. Assume that the production quantity varies from 1 to 100 with a step size of 0.01.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of cuckoos (solutions) and their corresponding costs.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each cuckoo (solution) using the cost function.\n3. Perform the search by updating the cuckoo's positions and evaluating their fitness.\n4. Replace the worst cuckoo with a new cuckoo if the new cuckoo has better fitness.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the cuckoo search algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef cost_function(x):\n    return 5000 * x + 10000 / x + 2000\n\ndef generate_cuckoo(nest, lb, ub):\n    return lb + (ub - lb) * np.random.rand(nest.shape[0])\n\ndef cuckoo_search(nest_size, lb, ub, max_iter):\n    nests = np.linspace(lb, ub, nest_size)\n    costs = np.array([cost_function(x) for x in nests])\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for i in range(nest_size):\n            new_nest = generate_cuckoo(nests[i], lb, ub)\n            new_cost = cost_function(new_nest)\n\n            if new_cost < costs[i]:\n                nests[i] = new_nest\n                costs[i] = new_cost\n\n        worst_nest_idx = np.argmax(costs)\n        new_nest = generate_cuckoo(nests[worst_nest_idx], lb, ub)\n        new_cost = cost_function(new_nest)\n\n        if new_cost < costs[worst_nest_idx]:\n            nests[worst_nest_idx] = new_nest\n            costs[worst_nest_idx] = new_cost\n\n    best_nest_idx = np.argmin(costs)\n    return nests[best_nest_idx], costs[best_nest_idx]\n\nnest_size = 25\nlb = 1\nub = 100\nmax_iter = 1000\n\nbest_production_quantity, min_cost = cuckoo_search(nest_size, lb, ub, max_iter)\nprint(\"Minimum cost:\", min_cost)\nprint(\"Corresponding production quantity:\", best_production_quantity)\n```\n\nThis implementation initializes a population of 25 cuckoos and runs the algorithm for 1000 iterations. The lower and upper bounds for the production quantity are set to 1 and 100, respectively. After running the algorithm, the minimum cost and corresponding production quantity are printed.\n\nPlease note that the cuckoo search algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the results may vary slightly between different runs. You can adjust the parameters (e.g., nest_size, max_iter) to fine-tune the algorithm's performance."
