    "message_1": "Suppose an investor has 10 stocks in their portfolio and the expected returns and standard deviations of each stock are as follows:\n\nStock A: Expected Return = 0.1, Standard Deviation = 0.2\nStock B: Expected Return = 0.08, Standard Deviation = 0.13\nStock C: Expected Return = 0.12, Standard Deviation = 0.25\nStock D: Expected Return = 0.15, Standard Deviation = 0.18\nStock E: Expected Return = 0.07, Standard Deviation = 0.11\nStock F: Expected Return = 0.11, Standard Deviation = 0.23\nStock G: Expected Return = 0.14, Standard Deviation = 0.17\nStock H: Expected Return = 0.09, Standard Deviation = 0.12\nStock I: Expected Return = 0.12, Standard Deviation = 0.21\nStock J: Expected Return = 0.05, Standard Deviation = 0.08\n\nIf the investor wants to create a portfolio of these stocks with an expected return of 0.1 and a risk (measured by standard deviation) of no more than 0.18, what is the optimal portfolio selection?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio selection, we need to consider the weights of each stock in the portfolio. Let's denote the weights of stocks A to J as wA, wB, wC, wD, wE, wF, wG, wH, wI, and wJ, respectively. The sum of all weights should be equal to 1:\n\nwA + wB + wC + wD + wE + wF + wG + wH + wI + wJ = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by the weighted sum of the expected returns of each stock:\n\n0.1 * wA + 0.08 * wB + 0.12 * wC + 0.15 * wD + 0.07 * wE + 0.11 * wF + 0.14 * wG + 0.09 * wH + 0.12 * wI + 0.05 * wJ = 0.1\n\nThe risk of the portfolio is given by the weighted sum of the standard deviations of each stock:\n\n0.2 * wA + 0.13 * wB + 0.25 * wC + 0.18 * wD + 0.11 * wE + 0.23 * wF + 0.17 * wG + 0.12 * wH + 0.21 * wI + 0.08 * wJ <= 0.18\n\nTo find the optimal portfolio selection, we need to solve this system of equations. However, this is a complex optimization problem that typically requires numerical methods and specialized software to solve. It is not possible to provide an exact solution here.\n\nIn practice, investors would use optimization algorithms and tools like the Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) or the Black-Litterman model to find the optimal portfolio weights that meet their desired expected return and risk constraints."
