    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+6) - log2(x-2) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the subtraction property of logarithms, which states that logb(m) - logb(n) = logb(m/n). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog2((x+6)/(x-2)) = 3\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n2^3 = (x+6)/(x-2)\n\n8 = (x+6)/(x-2)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by (x-2):\n\n8(x-2) = x+6\n\n8x - 16 = x + 6\n\nNow, subtract x from both sides:\n\n7x - 16 = 6\n\nAdd 16 to both sides:\n\n7x = 22\n\nNow, divide by 7:\n\nx = 22/7\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\nx = 22/7"
