    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 cm and one leg of length 6 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we know the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10 cm) and one leg (a = 6 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem formula is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nPlugging in the known values, we get:\n\n6^2 + b^2 = 10^2\n36 + b^2 = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 36\nb^2 = 64\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other leg (b) is 8 cm."
