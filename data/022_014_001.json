    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the harmonic function $u(x, y) = 3x^2 - 2y^2$ on the boundary of the closed rectangle $R = [0, 2] \\times [0, 3]$, we need to evaluate the function along the four sides of the rectangle and find the maximum value.\n\n1. Along the bottom side, $y = 0$: $u(x, 0) = 3x^2 - 2(0)^2 = 3x^2$. The range of $x$ is $[0, 2]$, so the maximum value occurs at $x = 2$. Thus, $u(2, 0) = 3(2)^2 = 12$.\n\n2. Along the top side, $y = 3$: $u(x, 3) = 3x^2 - 2(3)^2 = 3x^2 - 18$. The range of $x$ is $[0, 2]$, so the maximum value occurs at $x = 2$. Thus, $u(2, 3) = 3(2)^2 - 18 = 12 - 18 = -6$.\n\n3. Along the left side, $x = 0$: $u(0, y) = 3(0)^2 - 2y^2 = -2y^2$. The range of $y$ is $[0, 3]$, so the maximum value occurs at $y = 0$. Thus, $u(0, 0) = -2(0)^2 = 0$.\n\n4. Along the right side, $x = 2$: $u(2, y) = 3(2)^2 - 2y^2 = 12 - 2y^2$. The range of $y$ is $[0, 3]$, so the maximum value occurs at $y = 0$. Thus, $u(2, 0) = 12 - 2(0)^2 = 12$.\n\nComparing the maximum values found along the four sides of the rectangle, we see that the maximum value of $u(x, y)$ on the boundary of $R$ is $12$."
