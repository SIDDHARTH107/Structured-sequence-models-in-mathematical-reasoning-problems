    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given multiplication table. We can see that the identity element is 'e', as the multiplication of any element with 'e' gives the same element.\n\nNow, let's find the order of each element in the group G. The order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that the element raised to the power of n is equal to the identity element 'e'.\n\n- Order of a: a * a = e, so the order of a is 2.\n- Order of b: b * b = e, so the order of b is 2.\n- Order of c: c * c * c * c = e, so the order of c is 4.\n- Order of d: d * d * d * d = e, so the order of d is 4.\n- Order of f: f * f * f * f = e, so the order of f is 4.\n- Order of g: g * g * g * g = e, so the order of g is 4.\n- Order of h: h * h * h * h = e, so the order of h is 4.\n- Order of i: i * i * i * i = e, so the order of i is 4.\n- Order of j: j * j * j * j = e, so the order of j is 4.\n- Order of k: k * k * k * k = e, so the order of k is 4.\n- Order of l: l * l * l * l = e, so the order of l is 4.\n- Order of m: m * m * m * m = e, so the order of m is 4.\n- Order of n: n * n * n * n = e, so the order of n is 4.\n- Order of o: o * o * o * o = e, so the order of o is 4.\n- Order of p: p * p * p * p = e, so the order of p is 4.\n\nNow, let's use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of a group of order 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2. So, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. n_3 divides 32 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. So, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of the group G:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G would be isomorphic to the direct product of these two subgroups, which would be a group of order 2^5 * 3^1 = 96. However, this group would be abelian, which contradicts the given information that G is non-abelian. So, this case is not possible.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G would have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and G would be a semi-direct product of this subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32. This structure would result in a non-abelian group of order 96.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G would have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32, and G would be a semi-direct product of this subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. This structure would also result in a non-abelian group of order 96.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G would not have any normal Sylow subgroups, and the structure of G would be more complicated. However, this case would also result in a non-abelian group of order 96.\n\nSince G is non-abelian, we can eliminate the first case. Now, let's analyze the orders of the elements in the group G. We can see that all elements of G have orders that are powers of 2 (either 2 or 4). This means that G must have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32. Therefore, G is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3 (case 3).\n\nIn conclusion, the non-abelian group of order 96 that is isomorphic to the given group G is a semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3."
