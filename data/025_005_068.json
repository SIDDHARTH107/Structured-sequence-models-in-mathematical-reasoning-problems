    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the surface F(x, y, z) = x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2, we need to find the points where the gradient of F is equal to the zero vector. The gradient of F is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∇F = (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z)\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2xy^2 + 2xz^2\n∂F/∂y = 2x^2y + 2y^2z\n∂F/∂z = 2x^2z + 2y^2z\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y, z) where all three partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n2xy^2 + 2xz^2 = 0\n2x^2y + 2y^2z = 0\n2x^2z + 2y^2z = 0\n\nWe can simplify these equations by dividing by 2:\n\nxy^2 + xz^2 = 0\nx^2y + y^2z = 0\nx^2z + y^2z = 0\n\nNow, let's analyze the equations:\n\n1) If x = 0, then y and z can be any values, and all three equations will be satisfied.\n2) If y = 0, then x and z can be any values, and all three equations will be satisfied.\n3) If z = 0, then x and y can be any values, and all three equations will be satisfied.\n\nSo, there are infinitely many singular points on the surface F(x, y, z) = x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2, and they lie on the coordinate planes x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
