    "message_1": "Consider the function f(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + 5z - 6. Determine whether this function is an analytic function or not.",
    "message_2": "An analytic function is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series. In the context of complex analysis, a function is analytic if it is differentiable at every point in its domain.\n\nThe given function is f(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + 5z - 6. This is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is an analytic function."
