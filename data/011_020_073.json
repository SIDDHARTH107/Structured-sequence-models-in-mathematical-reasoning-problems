The time (in minutes) required to produce each type of the product on each machine is given below:\n\n| Product   | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A         | 2         | 3         | 2         |\n| B         | 1         | 1         | 3         |\n| C         | 3         | 1         | 1         |\n| D         | 2         | 2         | 2         |\n| E         | 1         | 4         | 1         |\n\nThe factory has 10 hours (600 minutes) per day to allocate for production. Assuming that each machine can only produce one product at a time, what is the maximum profit that the factory can produce per day, given that the profit of each product (in dollars) is as follows:\n\n- Product A: $10\n- Product B: $15\n- Product C: $20\n- Product D: $25\n- Product E: $30\n\nPlease use combinatorial optimization to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using combinatorial optimization, we will first calculate the profit per minute for each product on each machine. Then, we will allocate the products to the machines in a way that maximizes the total profit per day.\n\nProfit per minute for each product on each machine:\n\n| Product   | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A         | 5         | 3.33      | 5         |\n| B         | 15        | 15        | 5         |\n| C         | 6.67      | 20        | 20        |\n| D         | 12.5      | 12.5      | 12.5      |\n| E         | 30        | 7.5       | 30        |\n\nNow, we will allocate the products to the machines in a way that maximizes the total profit per day.\n\nMachine 1: Product E (30 profit/min)\nMachine 2: Product C (20 profit/min)\nMachine 3: Product E (30 profit/min)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of products produced per day and the total profit.\n\nMachine 1: 600 minutes / 1 minute per Product E = 600 Product E\nMachine 2: 600 minutes / 1 minute per Product C = 600 Product C\nMachine 3: 600 minutes / 1 minute per Product E = 600 Product E\n\nTotal profit per day:\n(600 Product E * $30) + (600 Product C * $20) = $18,000 (Product E) + $12,000 (Product C) = $30,000\n\nThe maximum profit that the factory can produce per day is $30,000."
