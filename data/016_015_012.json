    "message_2": "To find the order of the Hilbert curve, we can use the formula for the curve length:\n\ncurve_length = initial_length * (4 ^ order)\n\nIn this case, the curve length is given as 243 units. The initial length of the Hilbert curve is 1 unit (before any subdivisions). So, we can set up the equation:\n\n243 = 1 * (4 ^ order)\n\nNow, we need to solve for the order:\n\n243 = 4 ^ order\n\nTaking the logarithm base 4 of both sides:\n\nlog4(243) = log4(4 ^ order)\n\nlog4(243) = order\n\nUsing a calculator to find the logarithm base 4 of 243:\n\norder â‰ˆ 3.5\n\nSince the order must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number:\n\norder = 4\n\nSo, the order of the Hilbert curve with a curve length of 243 units is 4."
