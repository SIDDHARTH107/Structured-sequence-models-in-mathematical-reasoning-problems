    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of all U_n is not empty, we will use the concept of compactness. Recall that a topological space X is compact if every open cover of X has a finite subcover.\n\nConsider the sequence of closed sets {C_n}, where C_n = X - U_n (the complement of U_n in X). Since U_n are open sets, C_n are closed sets. Moreover, C_n is an increasing sequence of closed sets, i.e., C_1 ⊆ C_2 ⊆ C_3 ⊆ ...\n\nNow, let's assume that the intersection of all U_n is empty, i.e., ⋂ U_n = ∅. Then, the union of all C_n is equal to X, i.e., ⋃ C_n = X. Since X is compact, there exists a finite subcover of the open cover ⋃ C_n. Let's say this finite subcover is given by {C_n1, C_n2, ..., C_nk} where n1 < n2 < ... < nk.\n\nSince C_n is an increasing sequence of closed sets, we have C_nk ⊇ C_n(k-1) ⊇ ... ⊇ C_n1. Therefore, C_nk is also a cover of X, i.e., X = C_nk. This implies that U_nk = X - C_nk = ∅, which contradicts our assumption that U_n is not equal to the empty set for all n.\n\nHence, our assumption that ⋂ U_n = ∅ is false, and the intersection of all U_n is not empty."
