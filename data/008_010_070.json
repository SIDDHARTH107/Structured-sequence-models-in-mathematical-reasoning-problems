    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the given system into an upper triangular matrix. Then, we will use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  4 ]\n[ 2  3  1 | -1 ]\n[ 3 -1  2 |  2 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  4 ]\n[ 0 -1  3 | -9 ]\n[ 0 -7  5 | -10 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 7 * R2\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  4 ]\n[ 0 -1  3 | -9 ]\n[ 0  0 16 | -53 ]\n```\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. Let's use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\n16z = -53\nz = -53 / 16\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\n-y + 3z = -9\n-y + 3(-53/16) = -9\ny = (3 * 53) / 16 - 9 = 1\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nx + 2y - z = 4\nx + 2(1) - (-53/16) = 4\nx = 4 - 2 + 53/16 = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 1, and z = -53/16."
