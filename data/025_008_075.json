    "message_2": "A K3 surface is a complex projective algebraic variety of dimension 2 with trivial canonical bundle and H^1(X, O_X) = 0. The Hodge decomposition of the cohomology group H^k(X, C) is given by:\n\nH^k(X, C) = ⊕_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(X)\n\nwhere H^{p,q}(X) denotes the (p,q)-th Hodge group. We will find the dimensions of the Hodge groups for k = 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1. For k = 0:\n\nH^0(X, C) = H^{0,0}(X)\n\nThe dimension of H^{0,0}(X) is 1, as it corresponds to the constant functions on X.\n\n2. For k = 1:\n\nH^1(X, C) = H^{0,1}(X) ⊕ H^{1,0}(X)\n\nSince H^1(X, O_X) = 0, both H^{0,1}(X) and H^{1,0}(X) have dimension 0.\n\n3. For k = 2:\n\nH^2(X, C) = H^{0,2}(X) ⊕ H^{1,1}(X) ⊕ H^{2,0}(X)\n\nFor a K3 surface, the Hodge numbers h^{0,2} and h^{2,0} are both equal to 1. The Hodge number h^{1,1} is given by the formula:\n\nh^{1,1} = 22\n\nThis is because the second Betti number b_2 of a K3 surface is 22, and h^{1,1} = b_2 - h^{0,2} - h^{2,0}.\n\n4. For k = 3:\n\nH^3(X, C) = H^{0,3}(X) ⊕ H^{1,2}(X) ⊕ H^{2,1}(X) ⊕ H^{3,0}(X)\n\nSince X is a surface (i.e., has dimension 2), all of these Hodge groups have dimension 0.\n\nIn summary, the dimensions of the Hodge decomposition of the cohomology group H^k(X, C) for a K3 surface are:\n\n- k = 0: H^{0,0}(X) has dimension 1\n- k = 1: H^{0,1}(X) and H^{1,0}(X) both have dimension 0\n- k = 2: H^{0,2}(X) and H^{2,0}(X) both have dimension 1, and H^{1,1}(X) has dimension 22\n- k = 3: H^{0,3}(X), H^{1,2}(X), H^{2,1}(X), and H^{3,0}(X) all have dimension 0"
