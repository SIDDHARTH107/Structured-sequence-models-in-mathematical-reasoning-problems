    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of the city at time t, where t is measured in years. Since the population is growing at a rate proportional to the current population, we can write the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere k is the proportionality constant.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫k dt\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 100,000:\n\nln(100,000) = k(0) + C\n\nC = ln(100,000)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution:\n\nln(P) = kt + ln(100,000)\n\nTo find the value of k, we can use the information that the population was 80,000 ten years ago, which means P(-10) = 80,000:\n\nln(80,000) = k(-10) + ln(100,000)\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = (ln(80,000) - ln(100,000)) / (-10)\n\nk ≈ 0.0223\n\nNow, we can write the specific solution for P(t):\n\nln(P) = 0.0223t + ln(100,000)\n\nTo find the population in 20 years, we can plug in t = 20:\n\nln(P) = 0.0223(20) + ln(100,000)\n\nln(P) ≈ 0.446 + ln(100,000)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to find P:\n\nP ≈ e^(0.446 + ln(100,000))\n\nP ≈ e^0.446 * e^ln(100,000)\n\nP ≈ 1.562 * 100,000\n\nP ≈ 156,200\n\nSo, the population of the city in 20 years will be approximately 156,200."
