    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The perimeter of a Hilbert curve increases with each order. For a 3rd order Hilbert curve, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:\n\n1. In the 1st order Hilbert curve, there are 4 segments, each with a length of 1 unit.\n2. In the 2nd order Hilbert curve, each segment from the 1st order is replaced by 4 segments, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 segments, each with a length of 1 unit.\n3. In the 3rd order Hilbert curve, each segment from the 2nd order is replaced by 4 segments, so there are 4 * 16 = 64 segments, each with a length of 1 unit.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of a 3rd order Hilbert curve constructed using squares each with a side length of 1 unit is 64 units."
