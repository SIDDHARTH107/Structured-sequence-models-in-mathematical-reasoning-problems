    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and d is the diameter of the circle.\n\nGiven that the diameter (d) is 14 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(14)\nC ≈ 3.14159(14)\nC ≈ 43.98226\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
