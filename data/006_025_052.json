    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people who will witness this type of entertainment outcome, we can multiply the total number of people in the audience by the probability of the outcome occurring.\n\nExpected number of people = Total number of people × Probability of the outcome\nExpected number of people = 30 × 0.4\nExpected number of people = 12\n\nSo, 12 people in the audience are expected to witness this type of entertainment outcome."
