    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[3 - λ, -1], [4, 2 - λ]]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)(2 - λ) - (-1)(4) = λ^2 - 5λ + 10 - 4 = λ^2 - 5λ + 6\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ + 6 = 0\n\nThis equation factors as:\n\n(λ - 2)(λ - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 3.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n\n(A - 2I)v1 = 0\n[[1, -1], [4, 0]]v1 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we get the equation:\n\nv1 - v2 = 0 => v1 = v2\n\nWe can choose v1 = 1, then v2 = 1. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 2 is:\n\nv1 = [1, 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 3:\n\n(A - 3I)v2 = 0\n[[0, -1], [4, -1]]v2 = 0\n\nFrom the second row, we get the equation:\n\n4v1 - v2 = 0 => v2 = 4v1\n\nWe can choose v1 = 1, then v2 = 4. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 3 is:\n\nv2 = [1, 4]\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 3, with corresponding eigenvectors v1 = [1, 1] and v2 = [1, 4]."
