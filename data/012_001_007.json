    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node 1 and node 4, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distance to all other nodes to infinity.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n   Distance: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞}\n\n2. Set the current node as the node with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet. In this case, it's node 1 with a distance of 0.\n\n3. Update the distances to the neighbors of the current node (node 1) if the new path is shorter.\n\n   Distance: {1: 0, 2: 6, 3: 3, 4: ∞}\n\n4. Mark the current node (node 1) as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {2, 3, 4}\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all nodes are visited or the target node (node 4) is visited.\n\n   - Current node: 3 (smallest distance in unvisited nodes)\n   - Update distances: {1: 0, 2: 5 (3+2), 3: 3, 4: 8 (3+5)}\n   - Unvisited nodes: {2, 4}\n\n   - Current node: 2 (smallest distance in unvisited nodes)\n   - Update distances: {1: 0, 2: 5, 3: 3, 4: 8 (5+4)}\n   - Unvisited nodes: {4}\n\nSince the target node (node 4) is the only unvisited node left, we can stop the algorithm. The shortest path between node 1 and node 4 has a length of 8."
