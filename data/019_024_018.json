    "message_2": "To solve the equation 6x - 4 = 26 using abductive logic, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:\n6x - 4 + 4 = 26 + 4\n6x = 30\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for x:\n6x / 6 = 30 / 6\nx = 5\n\nSo, the value of x is 5."
