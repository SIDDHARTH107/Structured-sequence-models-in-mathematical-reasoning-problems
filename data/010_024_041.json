    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum formula for a triangle is given by:\n\nSum of angles = π + Area\n\nFor the given triangle with angles measuring 60°, 70°, and 80°, we first need to convert these angles to radians:\n\n60° = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n70° = (70 * π) / 180 = 7π/18 radians\n80° = (80 * π) / 180 = 4π/9 radians\n\nNow, we can find the sum of these angles:\n\nSum of angles = π/3 + 7π/18 + 4π/9\n\nTo add these angles, we need a common denominator, which is 18:\n\nSum of angles = 6π/18 + 7π/18 + 8π/18 = (6π + 7π + 8π) / 18 = 21π/18 = 7π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can use the hyperbolic angle sum formula to find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = Sum of angles - π = 7π/6 - π\n\nTo subtract these values, we need a common denominator, which is 6:\n\nArea = 7π/6 - 6π/6 = (7π - 6π) / 6 = π/6\n\nSo, the area of the triangle in hyperbolic geometry with angles measuring 60°, 70°, and 80° is π/6 square units."
