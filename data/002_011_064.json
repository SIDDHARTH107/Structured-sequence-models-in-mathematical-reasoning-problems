    "message_1": "In a right triangle, the length of one leg is 6 cm and the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm. What is the length of the other leg, to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter, using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two legs (a and b). In this case, we are given the length of one leg (a = 6 cm) and the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe can plug in the given values and solve for b:\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n100 - 36 = b^2\n64 = b^2\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find the length of the other leg (b):\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
