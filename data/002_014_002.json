    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 8 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: top, bottom, left, right, front, and back.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length by the width:\nArea_top_bottom = 10 cm * 5 cm = 50 cm²\nSince there are two faces (top and bottom), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_top_bottom = 2 * 50 cm² = 100 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the height by the width:\nArea_left_right = 8 cm * 5 cm = 40 cm²\nSince there are two faces (left and right), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_left_right = 2 * 40 cm² = 80 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length by the height:\nArea_front_back = 10 cm * 8 cm = 80 cm²\nSince there are two faces (front and back), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_front_back = 2 * 80 cm² = 160 cm²\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all the faces together:\nTotal_surface_area = Total_area_top_bottom + Total_area_left_right + Total_area_front_back\nTotal_surface_area = 100 cm² + 80 cm² + 160 cm² = 340 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 340 cm²."
