    "message_1": "A circus has 10 performers and wants to select a group of 3 performers to form a new acrobatic team. How many different combinations of 3 performers can be selected from the group of 10 performers?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different combinations of 3 performers that can be selected from a group of 10 performers, we use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of performers (10 in this case) and k is the number of performers to be selected (3 in this case).\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\n\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 3) = 720 / 6\n\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nSo there are 120 different combinations of 3 performers that can be selected from the group of 10 performers."
