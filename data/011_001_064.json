    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 10 friends, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (10) and k is the number of people in the committee (3).\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\n\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 3) = 720 / 6\n\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nSo there are 120 ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 10 friends."
