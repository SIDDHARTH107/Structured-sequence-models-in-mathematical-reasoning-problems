    "message_1": "In the Beauty Contest Game, there are 100 players and each player has to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game is the player whose chosen number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. What number should you pick to have the highest chance of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning the Beauty Contest Game, you need to think about what other players might choose and then base your choice on that. Let's assume that all players are rational and trying to win the game.\n\nIf all players choose a number uniformly at random between 0 and 100, the average of all chosen numbers would be 50. In this case, you should choose 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players think like this and choose 33.33, the new average would be 33.33, and the winning number would be 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nContinuing this line of thought, if all players choose 22.22, the winning number would be 2/3 * 22.22 = 14.81.\n\nThis process converges to a number close to 0. In practice, not all players will be perfectly rational, and some might still choose numbers closer to 100. Therefore, choosing a number slightly above 0, such as 1 or 2, might give you the highest chance of winning the game, as it accounts for the possibility of some players choosing higher numbers."
