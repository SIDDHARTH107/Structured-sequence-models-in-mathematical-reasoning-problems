    "message_1": "A student needs to pack a knapsack with a maximum capacity of 10kg for a hiking trip. They have 5 items with weights {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}kg and corresponding values {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} (higher value means a more desirable item). What is the optimal combination of items for the student to pack in order to maximize the total value while staying within the weight limit of their knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal combination of items, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained with a given weight limit and a certain number of items.\n\nLet's create a table with rows representing the items (0 to 5) and columns representing the weight limit (0 to 10).\n\nFor each item, we will iterate through the weight limits and decide whether to include the item or not. If the item's weight is less than or equal to the current weight limit, we will compare the value obtained by including the item (item's value + value of the remaining weight limit from the previous row) and the value obtained by not including the item (value from the previous row with the same weight limit). We will store the maximum of these two values in the table.\n\nAfter filling the table, the maximum value that can be obtained with a weight limit of 10kg and all 5 items will be stored in the bottom-right cell.\n\nHere's the filled table:\n\n```\n  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n1  0  0 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n2  0  0 10 20 20 30 30 30 30 30 30\n3  0  0 10 20 20 30 40 40 50 50 60\n4  0  0 10 20 20 30 40 40 50 60 60\n5  0  0 10 20 20 30 40 40 50 60 70\n```\n\nThe optimal value is 70, which can be obtained by selecting items with weights 4kg and 6kg (values 30 and 40). So the optimal combination of items is {4, 6}."
