    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using complex analysis techniques, we will first find the general solution to the homogeneous equation, then find a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation, and finally apply the boundary conditions to determine the unique solution.\n\nStep 1: General solution to the homogeneous equation\nThe homogeneous equation is given by:\n\nu''(x) + u'(x) + u(x) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. We can solve it by assuming a solution of the form u(x) = e^(rx), where r is a complex number. Substituting this into the ODE, we get:\n\nr^2 e^(rx) + r e^(rx) + e^(rx) = 0\n\nFactoring out e^(rx), we get the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 + r + 1 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots:\n\nr = (-1 ± √(-3))/2\n\nThese are complex conjugate roots, so the general solution to the homogeneous equation is:\n\nu_h(x) = C1 e^(-x/2) cos(√3x/2) + C2 e^(-x/2) sin(√3x/2)\n\nStep 2: Particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation\nThe inhomogeneous equation is given by:\n\nu''(x) + u'(x) + u(x) = x\n\nWe can assume a particular solution of the form u_p(x) = Ax + B. Differentiating twice, we get:\n\nu_p'(x) = A\nu_p''(x) = 0\n\nSubstituting these into the inhomogeneous equation, we get:\n\n0 + A + Ax + B = x\n\nComparing coefficients, we find:\n\nA = 1\nB = -1\n\nSo the particular solution is:\n\nu_p(x) = x - 1\n\nStep 3: General solution to the inhomogeneous equation\nThe general solution to the inhomogeneous equation is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\nu(x) = u_h(x) + u_p(x) = C1 e^(-x/2) cos(√3x/2) + C2 e^(-x/2) sin(√3x/2) + x - 1\n\nStep 4: Applying boundary conditions\nNow we apply the boundary conditions to determine the unique solution:\n\nu(0) = 1 => C1 e^(0) cos(0) + C2 e^(0) sin(0) + 0 - 1 = 1 => C1 = 2\n\nu(1) - u'(1) = e => (C1 e^(-1/2) cos(√3/2) + C2 e^(-1/2) sin(√3/2) + 1 - 1) - (-C1 e^(-1/2) cos(√3/2) + C2 e^(-1/2) sin(√3/2) + 1) = e\n\nSimplifying and substituting C1 = 2, we get:\n\nC2 e^(-1/2) sin(√3/2) = e/2\n\nSolving for C2, we find:\n\nC2 = (2/e) sin(√3/2)\n\nStep 5: Unique solution\nSubstituting the values of C1 and C2 back into the general solution, we get the unique solution:\n\nu(x) = 2 e^(-x/2) cos(√3x/2) + (2/e) sin(√3/2) e^(-x/2) sin(√3x/2) + x - 1"
