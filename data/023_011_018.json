Therefore, we can modify the integral limits as follows:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t)e^(-jωt)dt] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t - jωt)dt] from 0 to ∞\n\nLet's integrate with respect to t:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/(2 + jω))e^(-(2 + jω)t) | from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, apply the limits:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/(2 + jω))[e^(-(2 + jω)∞) - e^(-(2 + jω)0)]\n\nSince e^(-(2 + jω)∞) approaches 0 as t goes to infinity:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/(2 + jω))[0 - e^(0)]\n\nSince e^(0) = 1:\n\nF(ω) = -1/(2 + jω)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(t) = e^(-2t)u(t) is F(ω) = -1/(2 + jω)."
