    "message_2": "To find the equation of the sine function with an amplitude of 5 and a period of π/3, we can use the general form of a sine function:\n\ny = A * sin(B(x - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, we have:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 5\nPeriod = π/3\n\nThe period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nSo, we can find the value of B:\n\nπ/3 = 2π / B\nB = 2π / (π/3)\nB = 2π * (3/π)\nB = 6\n\nSince there is no information about phase shift (C) and vertical shift (D), we can assume they are both 0:\n\nC = 0\nD = 0\n\nNow we can write the equation of the sine function:\n\ny = 5 * sin(6x)"
