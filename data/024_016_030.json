    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T = fg$ with respect to the vector field $X$, we will use the Leibniz rule for covariant derivatives of tensor products. The Leibniz rule states that for a tensor product of two tensors $A$ and $B$, the covariant derivative with respect to a vector field $X$ is given by:\n\n$(\\nabla_X (AB)) = (\\nabla_X A) B + A (\\nabla_X B)$\n\nIn our case, $A = f$ and $B = g$. Since $f$ is a scalar function, its covariant derivative is just the ordinary directional derivative:\n\n$\\nabla_X f = X(f)$\n\nNow, we need to find the covariant derivative of the metric tensor $g$. By definition, the covariant derivative of the metric tensor with respect to any vector field is zero:\n\n$\\nabla_X g = 0$\n\nApplying the Leibniz rule, we get:\n\n$\\nabla_X T = \\nabla_X (fg) = (\\nabla_X f) g + f (\\nabla_X g) = X(f) g + f \\cdot 0 = X(f) g$\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $X$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla_X T = X(f) g$"
