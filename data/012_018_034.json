    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph with 7 vertices, we need to ensure that there is at least one vertex that has no path to the other vertices. In the worst-case scenario, we have a tree structure, which is a connected graph with the minimum number of edges, where the number of edges is equal to the number of vertices minus 1 (i.e., 7 - 1 = 6 edges).\n\nHowever, our graph has 10 edges, which means it has 4 extra edges compared to a tree structure. In order to disconnect the graph, we need to remove enough edges to make it a tree structure and then remove one more edge to disconnect it.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph is 4 (to make it a tree) + 1 (to disconnect the tree) = 5 edges."
