    "message_2": "To find the probability, we will use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of members in the ruling political party, which is 120,000. The total number of possible outcomes is the total population of the country, which is 2.5 million.\n\nProbability = 120,000 / 2,500,000\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\nProbability = 12 / 250\n\nProbability = 0.048\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected citizen from the country is a member of the ruling political party is 0.048 or 4.8%."
