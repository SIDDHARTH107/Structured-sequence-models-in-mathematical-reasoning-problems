    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge numbers for this smooth cubic surface, we will use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the fact that the surface is a hypersurface in projective 3-space. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth hypersurface $X$ of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^n$, the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}(X)$ are equal to the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}(\\mathbb{P}^n)$ for $p+q < n-1$ and $p+q > n+1$. For $p+q = n-1$ or $p+q = n+1$, the Hodge numbers are given by $h^{p,q}(X) = h^{p,q}(\\mathbb{P}^n) - 1$.\n\nIn our case, the cubic surface is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, so $n=3$. The Hodge diamond for $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is given by:\n\n```\n  1\n 0 0\n1 0 1\n 0 0\n  1\n```\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge numbers for the cubic surface using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem:\n\n1. For $p+q < 2$, we have $h^{p,q}(X) = h^{p,q}(\\mathbb{P}^3)$.\n2. For $p+q = 2$, we have $h^{p,q}(X) = h^{p,q}(\\mathbb{P}^3) - 1$.\n3. For $p+q > 4$, we have $h^{p,q}(X) = h^{p,q}(\\mathbb{P}^3)$.\n\nThus, the Hodge diamond for the cubic surface is:\n\n```\n  1\n 0 0\n1 9 1\n 0 0\n  1\n```\n\nSo, the Hodge numbers for the smooth cubic surface are $h^{0,0} = h^{4,4} = 1$, $h^{1,1} = h^{3,3} = 9$, and all other Hodge numbers are 0."
