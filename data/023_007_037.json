    "message_1": "A signal f(t) is given by f(t) = 5cos(3t) + 3sin(7t) + 8cos(10t) in the time domain. Use the Fourier transform to find the frequency content of the signal.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency content of the signal f(t) = 5cos(3t) + 3sin(7t) + 8cos(10t), we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nHowever, in this case, we can directly observe the frequency content of the signal without performing the Fourier transform. The signal f(t) is a sum of sinusoids, and the frequency content of a sum of sinusoids is simply the frequencies of the individual sinusoids.\n\nThe signal f(t) consists of three sinusoids:\n\n1. 5cos(3t): This is a cosine function with an angular frequency of 3 rad/s. The frequency in hertz is (3/2π) Hz.\n\n2. 3sin(7t): This is a sine function with an angular frequency of 7 rad/s. The frequency in hertz is (7/2π) Hz.\n\n3. 8cos(10t): This is a cosine function with an angular frequency of 10 rad/s. The frequency in hertz is (10/2π) Hz.\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal f(t) consists of three frequencies: (3/2π) Hz, (7/2π) Hz, and (10/2π) Hz."
