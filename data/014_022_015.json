    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept an encrypted message that was encrypted using the Playfair cipher with a key phrase \"MATHEMATICS\". Decrypt the following message using your knowledge of cryptanalysis and Playfair cipher: \n\n\"WPUVX FMNQA RUNAE TVKGB SMOJC\"",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message encrypted using the Playfair cipher, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key phrase \"MATHEMATICS\". We remove any duplicate letters from the key phrase and fill in the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe Playfair matrix for the key phrase \"MATHEMATICS\" is:\n\nM A T H E\nI C S B D\nF G K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we decrypt the message \"WPUVX FMNQA RUNAE TVKGB SMOJC\" by dividing it into digraphs and applying the decryption rules of the Playfair cipher:\n\n1. If both letters are the same, we replace them with the letters to their immediate left in the matrix (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If the letters form a rectangle in the matrix, we replace each letter with the one to its left in the same row (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters are in the same row, we replace each letter with the one to its left in the same row (wrapping around if necessary).\n4. If the letters are in the same column, we replace each letter with the one above it in the same column (wrapping around if necessary).\n\nDecrypting the message:\n\nWPUVX -> SECRE\nFMNQA -> TMESS\nRUNAE -> AGEXI\nTVKGB -> STHEB\nSMOJC -> ESTOF\n\nThe decrypted message is \"SECRET MESSAGE X THE BEST OF\". The 'X' is likely a filler letter used to separate words or complete a digraph. So, the final decrypted message is \"SECRET MESSAGE THE BEST OF\"."
