    "message_2": "The smallest value of \"c\" in the formula Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + c such that the sequence Z(n) remains bounded is c = -2.\n\nThis is related to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, which is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the sequence Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + c remains bounded when starting with Z(0) = 0. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is known to lie between -2 and 2 along the real axis. When c = -2, the sequence remains bounded, as Z(n) oscillates between 0 and -2. For values of c less than -2, the sequence becomes unbounded."
