    "message_2": "In Group Theory, there are five non-isomorphic groups of order 8. They are:\n\n1. The cyclic group C8 (also denoted as Z8), which has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}, where a^8 = 1.\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, C2 x C2, which is also known as the Klein four-group V. It has elements {1, a, b, ab}, where a^2 = b^2 = 1 and ab = ba.\n3. The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2, C4 x C2. It has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b}, where a^4 = b^2 = 1 and ab = ba^3.\n4. The dihedral group D4 (also denoted as D8), which is the group of symmetries of a square. It has elements {1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r^4 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^3s.\n5. The quaternion group Q8, which has elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}, where i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\n\nThese are all the non-isomorphic groups of order 8."
