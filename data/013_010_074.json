    "message_1": "Consider a market in which two companies, A and B, produce a homogenous product at the same cost c. The demand for the product is given by Q = 100 - P, where P is the price per unit of the product and Q is the total quantity demanded. The two companies simultaneously choose their production levels, denoted by Q_A and Q_B. \n\nSuppose that each company believes that its rival will produce a fixed quantity, q. Find the Nash equilibrium in which both companies produce the quantity they believe their rival will produce.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction functions for both companies A and B. The reaction function shows the best response of a company to the production level of its rival.\n\nLet's start with company A. Company A's profit function is given by:\n\nπ_A = (P - c) * Q_A\n\nSince Q = Q_A + Q_B and P = 100 - Q, we can rewrite the profit function as:\n\nπ_A = (100 - Q_A - Q_B - c) * Q_A\n\nNow, we need to find the production level Q_A that maximizes company A's profit, given the fixed production level q of company B. To do this, we take the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_A and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(π_A) / d(Q_A) = 100 - 2*Q_A - Q_B - c = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Q_A:\n\nQ_A = (100 - Q_B - c) / 2\n\nThis is company A's reaction function, which shows the optimal production level for company A given the production level of company B.\n\nNow, we do the same for company B. Company B's profit function is given by:\n\nπ_B = (P - c) * Q_B\n\nWe can rewrite the profit function as:\n\nπ_B = (100 - Q_A - Q_B - c) * Q_B\n\nTaking the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_B and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(π_B) / d(Q_B) = 100 - 2*Q_B - Q_A - c = 0\n\nSolving for Q_B:\n\nQ_B = (100 - Q_A - c) / 2\n\nThis is company B's reaction function, which shows the optimal production level for company B given the production level of company A.\n\nNow, we need to find the Nash equilibrium, which is the point where both companies produce the quantity they believe their rival will produce. In other words, we need to find the point where both reaction functions are equal:\n\n(Q_A, Q_B) = ((100 - Q_B - c) / 2, (100 - Q_A - c) / 2)\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we can set Q_A = Q_B:\n\n(100 - Q_B - c) / 2 = (100 - Q_A - c) / 2\n\nSince Q_A = Q_B, we can replace Q_A with Q_B:\n\nQ_B = (100 - Q_B - c) / 2\n\nSolving for Q_B:\n\n2*Q_B = 100 - Q_B - c\n\n3*Q_B = 100 - c\n\nQ_B = (100 - c) / 3\n\nSince Q_A = Q_B, we also have:\n\nQ_A = (100 - c) / 3\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium is:\n\n(Q_A, Q_B) = ((100 - c) / 3, (100 - c) / 3)"
