Player 2 also has a choice between two strategies: $\\text{C}$ or $\\text{D}$. The payoffs for each combination of strategies are given in the following matrix:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n& \\text{C} & \\text{D} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{A} & 3 & -2 \\\\\n\\text{B} & 4 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for each player and what is the value of the game?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for each player, we can use the minimax theorem. First, we'll find the minimum payoff for each of player 1's strategies:\n\n- If player 1 chooses strategy A, the minimum payoff is min(3, -2) = -2.\n- If player 1 chooses strategy B, the minimum payoff is min(4, 1) = 1.\n\nPlayer 1 wants to maximize their minimum payoff, so they should choose strategy B, which has a minimum payoff of 1.\n\nNow, we'll find the maximum payoff for each of player 2's strategies:\n\n- If player 2 chooses strategy C, the maximum payoff is max(3, 4) = 4.\n- If player 2 chooses strategy D, the maximum payoff is max(-2, 1) = 1.\n\nPlayer 2 wants to minimize the maximum payoff, so they should choose strategy D, which has a maximum payoff of 1.\n\nThe optimal strategy for player 1 is strategy B, and the optimal strategy for player 2 is strategy D. The value of the game is the payoff when both players play their optimal strategies, which is 1."
