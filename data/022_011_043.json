    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^2 - 1), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero. \n\nThe denominator is z^2 - 1, which can be factored as (z - 1)(z + 1). Setting this equal to zero, we get two singularities:\n\nz - 1 = 0 => z = 1\nz + 1 = 0 => z = -1\n\nNow, we need to determine the order and type of each singularity. Since the singularities are in the denominator, they are poles. To find the order of each pole, we need to determine the multiplicity of the corresponding factor in the denominator.\n\nFor z = 1, the corresponding factor is (z - 1), which has a multiplicity of 1. Therefore, the function f(z) has a pole of order 1 at z = 1.\n\nFor z = -1, the corresponding factor is (z + 1), which also has a multiplicity of 1. Therefore, the function f(z) has a pole of order 1 at z = -1.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^2 - 1) has two poles: a pole of order 1 at z = 1 and a pole of order 1 at z = -1."
