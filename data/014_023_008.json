    "message_2": "To decrypt a Rail Fence cipher with a key of 3, we need to arrange the ciphertext into a zigzag pattern with 3 rows and then read the plaintext message row by row. The ciphertext is \"TAOESOIAMGSNMNLAGRD_L\". \n\nFirst, let's determine the length of the ciphertext, which is 19 characters. We can now calculate the number of columns needed for the zigzag pattern. The pattern repeats every 4 columns (2 key - 2), so we need 19 / 4 = 4.75 â‰ˆ 5 full cycles, which gives us 5 * 4 = 20 columns. Since we only have 19 characters, we'll remove one column.\n\nNow, let's arrange the ciphertext into the zigzag pattern:\n\nT _ _ _ A\n_ O E S O\n_ _ I A M\n\nG S N M N\nL A G R D\n_ L _ _ _\n\nReading the plaintext message row by row, we get:\n\n\"TOO_MANY_SEAGULLS\""
