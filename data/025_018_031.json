    "message_2": "1. To find the rational points on the curve, we can use the method of descent. First, we note that the point $P = (3,3)$ is a rational point on the curve since $3^2 = 3^3 - 6\\cdot3 + 6$. We can use this point to find other rational points on the curve by considering the tangent at $P$. The tangent has the equation:\n\n$y - 3 = m(x - 3)$, where $m$ is the slope of the tangent.\n\nTo find the slope, we differentiate the equation of the curve with respect to $x$:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 6x + 6)$\n\n$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 6$\n\nNow, we plug in the coordinates of $P$:\n\n$2\\cdot3\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3\\cdot3^2 - 6$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3\\cdot9 - 6}{6} = 3$\n\nSo, the tangent at $P$ has the equation:\n\n$y - 3 = 3(x - 3)$\n\n$y = 3x - 6$\n\nNow, we substitute this into the equation of the curve:\n\n$(3x - 6)^2 = x^3 - 6x + 6$\n\n$9x^2 - 36x + 36 = x^3 - 6x + 6$\n\n$x^3 - 9x^2 + 30x - 30 = 0$\n\nWe can factor this cubic equation as:\n\n$(x - 3)(x^2 - 6x + 10) = 0$\n\nThe first factor corresponds to the point $P$. The second factor is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4\\cdot1\\cdot10}}{2\\cdot1} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$\n\nFor each value of $x$, we can find the corresponding value of $y$ using the equation of the tangent:\n\n$y = 3(3 \\pm \\sqrt{2}) - 6 = 3 \\pm 3\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, the rational points on the curve are:\n\n$P_1 = (3, 3)$\n$P_2 = (3 + \\sqrt{2}, 3 + 3\\sqrt{2})$\n$P_3 = (3 - \\sqrt{2}, 3 - 3\\sqrt{2})$\n\n2. Mori theory is a higher-dimensional analogue of the minimal model program for surfaces, and it is not applicable to this problem. Instead, we can use the classical method of finding a birational map from the elliptic curve to the projective line by considering the function field of the curve. However, this is a more advanced topic and requires knowledge of algebraic geometry.\n\n3. To find the intersection of the curve $E$ with the plane $x+y+z=0$, we can substitute $z = -x-y$ into the equation of the curve:\n\n$y^2 = (-x-y)^3 - 6(-x-y) + 6$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$y^2 = -x^3 - 3x^2y - 3xy^2 - y^3 + 6x + 6y$\n\nThis is a cubic equation in $x$ and $y$, so the intersection of the curve with the plane is a curve of degree 3. Since the intersection is non-singular, it is an irreducible curve of degree 3."
