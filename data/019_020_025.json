    "message_2": "The time complexity of the algorithm for solving the problem is O(2^n). To find the time it takes to solve the problem for an input size of 50 bits, we need to calculate 2^50.\n\n2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624\n\nSo, it would take 1,125,899,906,842,624 units of time to solve the problem for an input size of 50 bits. Keep in mind that the actual time it takes depends on the specific hardware and implementation of the algorithm. The time complexity only gives us an estimate of how the time required grows with the input size."
