    "message_2": "To prove that there is no rational number whose square is 2, we will use proof by contradiction. We will assume that there is a rational number whose square is 2 and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that there is a rational number x such that x^2 = 2. Since x is a rational number, it can be expressed as a fraction x = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., a and b are coprime), and b â‰  0.\n\nNow, we have (a/b)^2 = 2. Squaring both sides, we get:\n\na^2 / b^2 = 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by b^2, we get:\n\na^2 = 2b^2\n\nThis equation tells us that a^2 is an even number since it is equal to 2 times another integer (b^2). Therefore, a must also be an even number, because only even numbers squared result in an even number. Let's say a = 2c, where c is an integer.\n\nSubstituting a = 2c into the equation, we get:\n\n(2c)^2 = 2b^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4c^2 = 2b^2\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n2c^2 = b^2\n\nNow, we see that b^2 is an even number since it is equal to 2 times another integer (c^2). Therefore, b must also be an even number, because only even numbers squared result in an even number.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our initial assumption that a and b have no common factors other than 1. Since both a and b are even, they both have a common factor of 2. This contradiction means that our initial assumption that there is a rational number x such that x^2 = 2 must be false.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that there is no rational number whose square is 2."
