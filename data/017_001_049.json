    "message_2": "To determine whether a group G of order 4 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if G has an element of order 4: If G has an element of order 4, then it must be isomorphic to C4, since C4 is the only group of order 4 with an element of order 4. If G does not have an element of order 4, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. Check if all non-identity elements of G have order 2: If all non-identity elements of G have order 2, then G must be isomorphic to V4, since V4 is the only group of order 4 in which all non-identity elements have order 2.\n\nNow let's consider a specific example of a group of order 4: G = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element.\n\nSuppose the orders of the elements are as follows:\n\n- order(e) = 1\n- order(a) = 2\n- order(b) = 2\n- order(c) = 2\n\nSince there is no element of order 4, G cannot be isomorphic to C4. Now, we check if all non-identity elements have order 2. Indeed, they do, so G must be isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn summary, to determine whether a group of order 4 is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we need to check the orders of its elements. If there is an element of order 4, the group is isomorphic to C4. If all non-identity elements have order 2, the group is isomorphic to V4. In our example, the group G was isomorphic to V4."
