    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we need to eliminate one of the variables by adding or subtracting the equations. In this case, we can eliminate the x variable by multiplying the first equation by -2 and then adding the two equations.\n\nFirst, multiply the first equation by -2:\n\n-2(2x + 3y) = -2(5)\n-4x - 6y = -10\n\nNow, add the new equation to the second equation:\n\n(-4x - 6y) + (4x - 5y) = (-10) + (-11)\n-4x + 4x - 6y - 5y = -21\n-11y = -21\n\nNow, divide both sides by -11:\n\ny = 21/11\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 5\n2x + 3(21/11) = 5\n\nMultiply 3 by 21/11:\n\n2x + 63/11 = 5\n\nNow, subtract 63/11 from both sides:\n\n2x = 5 - 63/11\n\nTo subtract, we need a common denominator, which is 11:\n\n2x = (55/11) - (63/11)\n\nNow, subtract the numerators:\n\n2x = -8/11\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = (-8/11) / 2\n\nx = -4/11\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -4/11 and y = 21/11."
