    "message_2": "To find the y-intercept and slope of the linear equation, we first need to rewrite the equation in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nGiven equation: 4x + 6y = 12\n\nStep 1: Isolate y on one side of the equation.\n\n6y = -4x + 12\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 6.\n\ny = (-4/6)x + (12/6)\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation.\n\ny = (-2/3)x + 2\n\nNow, the equation is in the slope-intercept form, and we can identify the slope and y-intercept.\n\nSlope (m) = -2/3\nY-intercept (b) = 2"
