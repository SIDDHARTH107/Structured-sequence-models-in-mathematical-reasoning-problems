A random sample of 40 packs of screws is selected. \n\nWhat is the probability that the average number of screws in the sample pack is less than 118 screws?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample mean and is calculated as:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = 5 screws and n = 40 packs.\n\nSE = 5 / √40 ≈ 0.79\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 118 screws. The z-score is a measure of how many standard errors a value is from the population mean. It is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SE\n\nwhere X is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SE is the standard error.\n\nIn this case, X = 118 screws, μ = 120 screws, and SE ≈ 0.79.\n\nz = (118 - 120) / 0.79 ≈ -2.53\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.53. We can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the area to the left of the z-score, which represents the probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or an online calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score less than -2.53 is approximately 0.0057, or 0.57%.\n\nSo, the probability that the average number of screws in the sample pack is less than 118 screws is approximately 0.57%."
