    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = r_uv • N = 0\nN = r_vv • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface, which is given by:\n\nN = (r_u × r_v) / |r_u × r_v| = (-2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H using the formula:\n\nH = (EG - F^2)(LN + MN - 2LM) / 2(EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nE = 5\nF = 2\nG = 5\nL = -1 / sqrt(9)\nM = 0\nN = -1 / sqrt(9)\n\nNow, we can compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (5 * 5 - 2^2)(-1 / 9 + (-1 / 9) - 2 * 0) / 2(5 * 5 - 2^2)\nH = (21)(-2 / 9) / 42\nH = -2 / 9\n\nSo, the mean curvature at the point (1, 1, 2) is H = -2/9."
