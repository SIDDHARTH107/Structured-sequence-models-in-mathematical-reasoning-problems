    "message_1": "Let's say that the probability of a certain stock price increasing on a given day is 0.6 and the probability of it decreasing is 0.4. If an investor buys 100 shares of the stock, what is the probability that the total value of the investment will increase on that day?",
    "message_2": "Since the investor buys 100 shares of the stock, the probability of the total value of the investment increasing on that day is the same as the probability of the stock price increasing on that day. Therefore, the probability that the total value of the investment will increase on that day is 0.6 or 60%."
