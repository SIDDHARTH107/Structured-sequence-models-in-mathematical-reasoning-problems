    "message_2": "To prove that the given group G with presentation <a, b | a^6 = b^3 = 1, ba = a^2b> is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18, we will first show that G has order 18 and then show that it is non-abelian.\n\n1. Order of G:\n\nSince a^6 = 1 and b^3 = 1, the orders of a and b are 6 and 3, respectively. Now, consider the element ab. We will show that the elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b, a^4b, a^5b, b^2, ab^2, a^2b^2, a^3b^2, a^4b^2, a^5b^2} are distinct.\n\nSuppose there is a repetition among these elements. Then, we have:\n\na^i * b^j = a^k * b^l, where 0 ≤ i, k ≤ 5 and 0 ≤ j, l ≤ 2.\n\nMultiplying both sides by (a^k)^(-1) * (b^l)^(-1) gives:\n\na^(i-k) = b^(l-j).\n\nIf l ≠ j, then the left side has an 'a' term, while the right side has a 'b' term, which is a contradiction. So, l = j, and we have:\n\na^(i-k) = 1.\n\nSince the order of a is 6, this implies that i = k. Thus, all 18 elements are distinct, and the order of G is 18.\n\n2. Non-abelian property:\n\nTo show that G is non-abelian, we need to find two elements in G that do not commute. From the presentation, we have:\n\nba = a^2b.\n\nIf G were abelian, then ba = ab, which would imply that a^2b = ab. Multiplying both sides by a^(-1) * b^(-1) gives:\n\na = 1, which is a contradiction since the order of a is 6.\n\nThus, G is non-abelian.\n\nSince G has order 18 and is non-abelian, it is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18."
