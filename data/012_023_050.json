    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest clique in the graph.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\nVertices: A, B, C, D, E, F\nEdges: AB, AC, BC, BD, CE, DE, EF\n\nNow, let's find the cliques in the graph:\n\n1. {A, B, C} - This is a clique of size 3, as all vertices are connected to each other (AB, AC, BC).\n2. {B, D} - This is a clique of size 2 (BD).\n3. {C, E} - This is a clique of size 2 (CE).\n4. {D, E} - This is a clique of size 2 (DE).\n5. {E, F} - This is a clique of size 2 (EF).\n\nThere are no cliques of size 4 or larger in the graph. Therefore, the clique number of the graph is 3."
