The data is collected as follows:\n\n- Out of the 50 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, only 30 patients survived for more than 6 months. \n- Out of these 30 patients, 20 patients survived for more than 12 months.\n- Out of these 20 patients, 15 patients survived for more than 18 months.\n\nCalculate the estimated survival probabilities for these patients at 6, 12, and 18 months after the diagnosis date using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Round your answers to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The Kaplan-Meier estimator is used to estimate the survival probabilities at different time points. It is calculated as follows:\n\nS(t) = (number of patients surviving at time t) / (number of patients at risk at time t)\n\nLet's calculate the survival probabilities at 6, 12, and 18 months.\n\n1. At 6 months:\nNumber of patients surviving at 6 months = 30\nNumber of patients at risk at 6 months = 50\nS(6) = 30/50 = 0.60\n\n2. At 12 months:\nNumber of patients surviving at 12 months = 20\nNumber of patients at risk at 12 months = 30 (since only 30 patients survived more than 6 months)\nS(12) = 20/30 = 0.67\n\n3. At 18 months:\nNumber of patients surviving at 18 months = 15\nNumber of patients at risk at 18 months = 20 (since only 20 patients survived more than 12 months)\nS(18) = 15/20 = 0.75\n\nSo, the estimated survival probabilities for these patients at 6, 12, and 18 months after the diagnosis date are:\n\nS(6) = 0.60 (rounded to two decimal places)\nS(12) = 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\nS(18) = 0.75 (rounded to two decimal places)"
