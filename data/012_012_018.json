    "message_2": "A connected graph G with 12 vertices and degree of each vertex exactly 3 is a 3-regular graph. To determine the minimum girth, we need to find the smallest cycle in the graph.\n\nLet's consider the number of edges in the graph. Since each vertex has degree 3, the total degree of the graph is 3 * 12 = 36. By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 edges in the graph.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of edges in a cycle. If the minimum girth is 3, then there is a triangle in the graph. A triangle has 3 edges, so the maximum number of triangles we can have in the graph is 18 / 3 = 6. However, if we have 6 triangles, then each vertex would be part of 2 triangles, which means that each vertex would have a degree of 4, which contradicts the given condition that each vertex has degree 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum girth cannot be 3. Let's consider the case where the minimum girth is 4. In this case, the smallest cycle is a quadrilateral. We can construct a 3-regular graph with 12 vertices and girth 4 as follows:\n\n1. Arrange the 12 vertices in a circle.\n2. Connect each vertex to its two neighbors, forming a 12-gon.\n3. Connect each vertex to the vertex that is 4 steps away in the circle.\n\nThis construction results in a 3-regular graph with 12 vertices and girth 4. Since we have shown that the minimum girth cannot be 3, the minimum girth of the graph is 4."
