    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In the context of the 2-dimensional Euclidean space with the given metric, we are looking for transformations that preserve the distance between points while fixing the origin. \n\nLet's denote a point in the 2-dimensional Euclidean space as $(x, y)$. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the metric:\n\n$$d^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2.$$\n\nNow, let's consider a transformation $T$ that maps a point $(x, y)$ to a new point $(x', y')$. We want to find all such transformations that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. $T(0, 0) = (0, 0)$, i.e., the origin is fixed.\n2. The distance between any two points is preserved under the transformation, i.e., $d^2 = d'^2$, where $d'$ is the distance between the transformed points $(x_1', y_1')$ and $(x_2', y_2')$.\n\nIn the 2-dimensional Euclidean space, there are two types of isometries that fix the origin:\n\n1. Rotations: A rotation by an angle $\\theta$ around the origin can be represented by the following transformation:\n\n$$x' = x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta,$$\n$$y' = x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta.$$\n\n2. Reflections: A reflection across a line passing through the origin with an angle $\\alpha$ to the x-axis can be represented by the following transformation:\n\n$$x' = x \\cos 2\\alpha + y \\sin 2\\alpha,$$\n$$y' = x \\sin 2\\alpha - y \\cos 2\\alpha.$$\n\nThese transformations satisfy both conditions mentioned above. Therefore, the isometries of the given metric that fix the origin are rotations and reflections."
