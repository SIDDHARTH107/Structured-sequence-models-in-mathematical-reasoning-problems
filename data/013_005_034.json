    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example question for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a game of Chicken, two drivers are driving towards each other on a narrow road. Each driver can either swerve to avoid the collision or continue driving straight ahead. If both drivers swerve, they both receive a payoff of 0. If one driver swerves and the other continues straight ahead, the driver who continues straight ahead receives a payoff of 3 and the driver who swerves receives a payoff of -1. If both drivers continue straight ahead, they both receive a payoff of -5. What is the Nash equilibrium of this game, and what are the payoffs for each player in the Nash equilibrium strategy?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. Let's denote the strategies as S (swerve) and C (continue straight ahead). We can create a payoff matrix to represent the game:\n\n```\n          Player 2\n          S   C\n        +-----+-----+\nPlayer 1| 0,0 | -1,3 |\n        S+-----+-----+\n        | 3,-1| -5,-5|\n        C+-----+-----+\n```\n\nNow, let's find the best responses for each player:\n\n1. If Player 1 swerves (S), Player 2's best response is to continue straight ahead (C) for a payoff of 3.\n2. If Player 1 continues straight ahead (C), Player 2's best response is to swerve (S) for a payoff of 3.\n3. If Player 2 swerves (S), Player 1's best response is to continue straight ahead (C) for a payoff of 3.\n4. If Player 2 continues straight ahead (C), Player 1's best response is to swerve (S) for a payoff of 3.\n\nThere are two Nash equilibria in this game: (S, C) and (C, S). In both cases, one player swerves and the other continues straight ahead. The payoffs for each player in these Nash equilibrium strategies are (3, -1) and (-1, 3), respectively."
