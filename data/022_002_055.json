    "message_2": "First, let's find the image of the straight line segment from $1$ to $-1$ under the mapping $f(z)$. We can parameterize this line segment as $z(t) = 1 - 2t$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. Now, we can find the image of this line segment under $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z(t)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((1-2t) + \\frac{1}{1-2t}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{(1-2t)^2 + 1}{1-2t}\\right)$$\n\nNow, let's find the image of the semicircle $|z|=1$ from $-1$ to $1$ under the mapping $f(z)$. We can parameterize this semicircle as $z(\\theta) = e^{i\\theta}$ for $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$. Now, we can find the image of this semicircle under $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z(\\theta)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{1}{e^{i\\theta}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta}\\right) = \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nSo, the image of the curve $C$ under the mapping $f(z)$ is the union of the curve $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{(1-2t)^2 + 1}{1-2t}\\right)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ and the curve $\\cos(\\theta)$ for $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$. \n\nTo find the complete image of the curve $C$, we need to find the endpoints of the image of the straight line segment and the semicircle. For the straight line segment, we have:\n\n$$f(z(0)) = f(1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 1) = 1$$\n$$f(z(1)) = f(-1) = \\frac{1}{2}(-1 + 1) = 0$$\n\nFor the semicircle, we have:\n\n$$f(z(0)) = \\cos(0) = 1$$\n$$f(z(\\pi)) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$$\n\nThus, the image of the curve $C$ under the mapping $f(z)$ is the curve that starts at $1$, follows the curve $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{(1-2t)^2 + 1}{1-2t}\\right)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$, and then follows the curve $\\cos(\\theta)$ for $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$ back to $1$. This curve is an ellipse with foci at $1$ and $-1$ and a major axis of length $2$."
