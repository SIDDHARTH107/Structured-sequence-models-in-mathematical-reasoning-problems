They are given the following problem:\n\nLet X be an algebraic curve defined by the equation X: y^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x. Find the equation of the birational transformation from X to the affine line.",
    "message_2": "To find the birational transformation from the curve X to the affine line, we can use the technique of finding a rational parametrization of the curve. In this case, we can find a rational function in x and y that represents the curve X.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given equation as:\n\ny^2 = x(x^2 + 2x - 4)\n\nNow, let's make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let t = x + 1, then x = t - 1. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\ny^2 = (t - 1)(t^2 - 2t + 1)\n\nNow, let's find a rational function R(t) such that R(t)^2 = t^2 - 2t + 1. We can do this by setting:\n\nR(t) = t - 1\n\nNow, we have:\n\ny^2 = (t - 1)R(t)^2\n\nSo, y = (t - 1)R(t) = (t - 1)(t - 1) = t^2 - 2t + 1\n\nNow, we have a rational parametrization of the curve X:\n\nx = t - 1\ny = t^2 - 2t + 1\n\nThis gives us the birational transformation from X to the affine line:\n\n(t, t^2 - 2t + 1) -> (t - 1, t^2 - 2t + 1)\n\nIn the reverse direction, the transformation is given by:\n\n(x, y) -> (x + 1, y)"
