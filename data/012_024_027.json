    "message_2": "Euler's formula for a connected planar graph is given by:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 10 and E = 20. We want to determine the genus of the graph, which is the minimum number of handles that need to be added to a sphere to embed the graph without any edge crossings.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of edges (E_max) for a planar graph with V vertices:\n\nE_max = 3V - 6\n\nFor our graph with 10 vertices:\n\nE_max = 3 * 10 - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24\n\nSince our graph has 20 edges, which is less than or equal to E_max, it is possible that the graph is planar (genus 0). However, we need to check if the graph is indeed planar by finding the number of faces (F).\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E = 2 - 10 + 20 = 12\n\nNow, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\n20 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n\n20 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph is planar, and its genus is 0."
