    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the property of logarithms that states: log_a(b) + log_a(c) = log_a(bc). \n\nApplying this property to the given equation, we get:\n\nlog base 2 of [(2x-1)(x+1)] = 3\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation to the power of the base (2):\n\n(2x-1)(x+1) = 2^3\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation:\n\n2x^2 + x - x - 1 = 8\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n2x^2 - 1 = 8\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n2x^2 - 9 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 0, and c = -9:\n\nx = (± √(0^2 - 4(2)(-9))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (± √(72)) / 4\n\nx = ±(6√2) / 4\n\nx = ±(3√2) / 2\n\nSo, the two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = (3√2) / 2 and x = -(3√2) / 2\n\nHowever, we must check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation and making sure the logarithms are defined (i.e., the arguments are positive). \n\nFor x = (3√2) / 2:\n\n2x - 1 = 2((3√2) / 2) - 1 = 3√2 - 1 > 0\nx + 1 = ((3√2) / 2) + 1 > 0\n\nBoth logarithms are defined, so x = (3√2) / 2 is a valid solution.\n\nFor x = -(3√2) / 2:\n\n2x - 1 = 2(- (3√2) / 2) - 1 < 0\nx + 1 = -((3√2) / 2) + 1 < 0\n\nBoth logarithms are not defined, so x = -(3√2) / 2 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution for x is:\n\nx = (3√2) / 2"
