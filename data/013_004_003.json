    "message_1": "In the Battle of the Sexes game, John and Jane are trying to decide whether to go to the opera or the football game. John prefers the football game and Jane prefers the opera. If they both choose the same activity, they each receive a payoff of 2. If they choose different activities, John receives a payoff of 1 and Jane receives a payoff of 3. \n\nSuppose John and Jane play this game for 10 rounds. In each round, they independently choose between the opera and the football game without knowing each other's choice. What is the expected payoff for John if he always chooses the football game?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of Jane choosing the opera as p and the probability of her choosing the football game as (1-p). Since John always chooses the football game, his expected payoff in each round can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected payoff per round = (Payoff if Jane chooses football) * (Probability of Jane choosing football) + (Payoff if Jane chooses opera) * (Probability of Jane choosing opera)\n\nExpected payoff per round = (2) * (1-p) + (1) * (p)\n\nSince we don't know the exact probability of Jane choosing the opera or the football game, we cannot determine the exact expected payoff for John in each round. However, we can express his expected payoff for 10 rounds as a function of p:\n\nExpected payoff for 10 rounds = 10 * [(2) * (1-p) + (1) * (p)] = 10 * (2 - p)\n\nWithout knowing the value of p, we cannot determine the exact expected payoff for John over the 10 rounds."
