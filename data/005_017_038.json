After that, we can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors will be the principal components, and the eigenvalues will be their corresponding variances.\n\n1. Standardize the data:\n\nTo standardize the data, we need to subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation for each column.\n\nMean of each column:\nmean_salaries = (50000 + 60000 + 80000 + 70000) / 4 = 65000\nmean_education = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) / 4 = 5\nmean_experience = (5 + 10 + 15 + 20) / 4 = 12.5\nmean_job_titles = (3 + 7 + 12 + 18) / 4 = 10\n\nStandard deviation of each column:\nstd_salaries = sqrt(((50000-65000)^2 + (60000-65000)^2 + (80000-65000)^2 + (70000-65000)^2) / 4) ≈ 11180.34\nstd_education = sqrt(((2-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (6-5)^2 + (8-5)^2) / 4) ≈ 2.236\nstd_experience = sqrt(((5-12.5)^2 + (10-12.5)^2 + (15-12.5)^2 + (20-12.5)^2) / 4) ≈ 5.590\nstd_job_titles = sqrt(((3-10)^2 + (7-10)^2 + (12-10)^2 + (18-10)^2) / 4) ≈ 5.196\n\nStandardized matrix A:\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n(50000-65000)/11180.34 & (2-5)/2.236 & (5-12.5)/5.590 & (3-10)/5.196 \\\\\n(60000-65000)/11180.34 & (4-5)/2.236 & (10-12.5)/5.590 & (7-10)/5.196 \\\\\n(80000-65000)/11180.34 & (6-5)/2.236 & (15-12.5)/5.590 & (12-10)/5.196 \\\\\n(70000-65000)/11180.34 & (8-5)/2.236 & (20-12.5)/5.590 & (18-10)/5.196 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n2. Compute the covariance matrix:\n\nCovariance matrix C = (1/(n-1)) * (A^T * A), where n is the number of rows in A.\n\n3. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix:\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors can be found using various numerical methods, such as the power iteration method or QR algorithm.\n\nThe eigenvectors will be the principal components, and the eigenvalues will be their corresponding variances. Note that the principal components are orthogonal to each other, and they represent the directions of maximum variance in the data."
