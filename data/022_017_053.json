Find the general solution y(x) of this differential equation in the form of y(x) = c1*cos(2x) + c2*sin(2x), where c1 and c2 are complex constants determined by the initial or boundary conditions.",
    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0, we first consider the characteristic equation associated with the differential equation:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr^2 = -4\nr = Â±2i\n\nSince the roots are complex, the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation is given by:\n\ny(x) = c1 * e^(2ix) + c2 * e^(-2ix)\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite the exponential functions in terms of cosine and sine functions:\n\ne^(2ix) = cos(2x) + i*sin(2x)\ne^(-2ix) = cos(-2x) + i*sin(-2x) = cos(2x) - i*sin(2x) (since cos(-x) = cos(x) and sin(-x) = -sin(x))\n\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the general solution:\n\ny(x) = c1 * (cos(2x) + i*sin(2x)) + c2 * (cos(2x) - i*sin(2x))\n\nCombine the real and imaginary parts:\n\ny(x) = (c1 + c2) * cos(2x) + i*(c1 - c2) * sin(2x)\n\nNow, let c1 + c2 = C1 (a complex constant) and i*(c1 - c2) = C2 (another complex constant). Then the general solution can be written as:\n\ny(x) = C1 * cos(2x) + C2 * sin(2x)\n\nHere, C1 and C2 are complex constants that can be determined by the initial or boundary conditions."
