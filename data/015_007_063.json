    "message_2": "To find the 2-cycle and 4-cycle values of r, we need to analyze the period-doubling bifurcations in the logistic map.\n\nFor a 2-cycle, we have two points x1 and x2 such that:\n\nx2 = r * x1 * (1 - x1)\nx1 = r * x2 * (1 - x2)\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\nx1 = r * (r * x1 * (1 - x1)) * (1 - r * x1 * (1 - x1))\n\nThis equation represents a 2-cycle. To find the value of r for which the 2-cycle occurs, we need to find the value of r for which the fixed point (x1 = x2) becomes unstable. To do this, we can find the derivative of the logistic map with respect to x:\n\ndxn+1/dxn = r - 2 * r * xn\n\nAt the fixed point, xn+1 = xn, so:\n\nr - 2 * r * x1 = 1\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = 1 / (1 - 2 * x1)\n\nSubstituting the fixed point equation (x1 = r * x1 * (1 - x1)) into this equation, we get:\n\nr = 1 / (1 - 2 * r * x1 * (1 - x1))\n\nSolving for r, we find that the 2-cycle occurs at r ≈ 3.00.\n\nFor a 4-cycle, we have four points x1, x2, x3, and x4 such that:\n\nx2 = r * x1 * (1 - x1)\nx3 = r * x2 * (1 - x2)\nx4 = r * x3 * (1 - x3)\nx1 = r * x4 * (1 - x4)\n\nTo find the value of r for which the 4-cycle occurs, we can analyze the period-doubling bifurcation between the 2-cycle and the 4-cycle. The ratio of the consecutive bifurcation values of r converges to the Feigenbaum constant δ ≈ 4.669. Therefore, we can approximate the value of r for the 4-cycle as:\n\nr_4-cycle ≈ r_2-cycle + (r_2-cycle / δ)\n\nr_4-cycle ≈ 3.00 + (3.00 / 4.669) ≈ 3.64\n\nSo, the 2-cycle value of r is approximately 3.00, and the 4-cycle value of r is approximately 3.64."
