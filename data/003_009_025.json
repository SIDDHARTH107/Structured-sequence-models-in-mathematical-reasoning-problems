    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Sines to find the third side of the triangle. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\nSide A = 12 cm (adjacent to the 60-degree angle)\nSide B = 8 cm (opposite to the 60-degree angle)\nAngle A = 60 degrees\n\nWe need to find Angle B and Side C to determine the perimeter of the triangle.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines, we have:\n\nSide A / sin(Angle A) = Side B / sin(Angle B)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n12 / sin(60) = 8 / sin(Angle B)\n\nNow, we know that sin(60) = √3 / 2, so:\n\n12 / (√3 / 2) = 8 / sin(Angle B)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(12 * 2) / √3 = 8 / sin(Angle B)\n24 / √3 = 8 / sin(Angle B)\n\nNow, multiply both sides by sin(Angle B) and by √3:\n\n24 * sin(Angle B) = 8 * √3\n\nDivide both sides by 24:\n\nsin(Angle B) = (8 * √3) / 24\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(Angle B) = √3 / 3\n\nNow, we find the value of Angle B:\n\nAngle B = arcsin(√3 / 3) ≈ 30 degrees\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can find Angle C:\n\nAngle C = 180 - Angle A - Angle B\nAngle C = 180 - 60 - 30\nAngle C = 90 degrees\n\nNow that we have Angle C, we can use the Law of Sines again to find Side C:\n\nSide A / sin(Angle A) = Side C / sin(Angle C)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n12 / sin(60) = Side C / sin(90)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1:\n\n12 / (√3 / 2) = Side C / 1\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(12 * 2) / √3 = Side C\n24 / √3 = Side C\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\n(24 * √3) / 3 = Side C\n\nSimplifying:\n\n8 * √3 = Side C\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = Side A + Side B + Side C\nPerimeter = 12 + 8 + 8 * √3 ≈ 12 + 8 + 13.856 ≈ 33.856 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is approximately 33.856 cm."
