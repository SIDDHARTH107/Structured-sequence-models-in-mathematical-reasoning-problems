    "message_1": "A company manufactures five different products, each of which requires a specific amount of three resources: resource A, resource B, and resource C. The company has 500 units of resource A, 700 units of resource B, and 400 units of resource C available. Each product yields a different profit per unit. The profit for product 1 is $5 per unit, for product 2 is $8 per unit, for product 3 is $7 per unit, for product 4 is $10 per unit and for product 5 is $6 per unit. How many units of each product should the company manufacture to maximize its total profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the amount of each resource required to produce one unit of each product. Let's denote the amount of resource A, B, and C required to produce one unit of product i as a_i, b_i, and c_i, respectively. Let x_i be the number of units of product i to be produced.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit:\n\nP = 5x_1 + 8x_2 + 7x_3 + 10x_4 + 6x_5\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\na_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3 + a_4x_4 + a_5x_5 <= 500 (resource A constraint)\nb_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3 + b_4x_4 + b_5x_5 <= 700 (resource B constraint)\nc_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + c_3x_3 + c_4x_4 + c_5x_5 <= 400 (resource C constraint)\n\nx_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWithout the specific values for a_i, b_i, and c_i, we cannot provide a numerical solution. However, this is a linear programming problem, and it can be solved using the simplex method or other optimization techniques to find the optimal values of x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, and x_5 that maximize the total profit P."
