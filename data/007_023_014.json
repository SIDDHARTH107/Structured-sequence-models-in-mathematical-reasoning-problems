If the message input has a size of 512 bits, what is the probability that two different messages will produce the same hash output? Show all work and round your final answer to the nearest thousandth.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Birthday Paradox concept. The Birthday Paradox states that in a set of n randomly chosen people, there is a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday, when n is approximately equal to the square root of the number of possible birthdays (365 in this case).\n\nIn our case, we have a hash function that produces a fixed size of 256 bits. This means there are 2^256 possible hash outputs. The message input has a size of 512 bits, which means there are 2^512 possible messages. We want to find the probability that two different messages will produce the same hash output.\n\nLet's use the Birthday Paradox concept. We need to find the number of messages (n) such that there is a 50% chance that at least two messages produce the same hash output. This can be approximated as:\n\nn ≈ √(2 * number of possible hash outputs)\n\nn ≈ √(2 * 2^256)\n\nn ≈ √(2^257)\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that two different messages will produce the same hash output. This can be calculated as:\n\nP(same hash output) = n / number of possible messages\n\nP(same hash output) = √(2^257) / 2^512\n\nP(same hash output) = 2^(257/2) / 2^512\n\nP(same hash output) = 2^(514/2 - 512)\n\nP(same hash output) = 2^(-498)\n\nThe probability is extremely low, as the exponent is negative. To round the final answer to the nearest thousandth, we can use a calculator or software to find the decimal value:\n\nP(same hash output) ≈ 1.62 * 10^(-150)\n\nRounded to the nearest thousandth, the probability is approximately 0.000."
