    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve C between x = 0 and x = 2, we will use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = 2x^2 + 1\ndy/dx = 4x\n\nNow, we will plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 2] √(1 + (4x)^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 2] √(1 + 16x^2) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral. This integral is a bit tricky and requires a substitution. Let's use the substitution:\n\nu = 4x\ndu/dx = 4\ndx = du/4\n\nNow, we need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nx = 0 => u = 4(0) = 0\nx = 2 => u = 4(2) = 8\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[0, 8] √(1 + u^2) (du/4)\n\nL = (1/4) ∫[0, 8] √(1 + u^2) du\n\nThis integral is a standard integral, and its antiderivative is:\n\n(1/2) * (u * √(1 + u^2) + arcsinh(u))\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\nL = (1/4) * [(1/2) * (8 * √(1 + 8^2) + arcsinh(8)) - (1/2) * (0 * √(1 + 0^2) + arcsinh(0))]\n\nL = (1/4) * [(1/2) * (8 * √(1 + 64) + arcsinh(8)) - (1/2) * (0)]\n\nL = (1/4) * [(1/2) * (8 * √(65) + arcsinh(8))]\n\nL = (1/8) * (8 * √(65) + arcsinh(8))\n\nL ≈ 8.372\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve C between x = 0 and x = 2 is approximately 8.372."
