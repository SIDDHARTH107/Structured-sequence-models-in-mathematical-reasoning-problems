    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 10x + 15y + 5i*z = -5\n(2) 10x - 4y + 8i*z = 20\n\nNow, subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate x:\n\n(3) -19y + 3i*z = 25\n\nNext, let's multiply the first equation by i and the third equation by 2 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n(4) 2i*x + 3i*y - z = -i\n(5) -2i*x + 4y - 6z = 4i\n\nNow, add equation (4) and equation (5) to eliminate x:\n\n(6) 3i*y - 7z = 3i\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables, y and z:\n\n(3) -19y + 3i*z = 25\n(6) 3i*y - 7z = 3i\n\nLet's multiply equation (6) by 19/3i to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(7) -19y + 133/3*z = 19\n\nNow, add equation (3) and equation (7) to eliminate y:\n\n(8) (133/3 - 9i)*z = 44\n\nNow, divide both sides of equation (8) by (133/3 - 9i) to find z:\n\nz = 44 / (133/3 - 9i)\n\nTo find the complex number in the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\nz = (44 * (133/3 + 9i)) / ((133/3 - 9i) * (133/3 + 9i))\n\nz = (5888 + 396i) / (133^2/3^2 + 9^2)\n\nz = (5888 + 396i) / (17689/9)\n\nNow, multiply the numerator and denominator by 9 to get rid of the fraction:\n\nz = (53092 + 3564i) / 17689\n\nNow, we have the value of z. To find the value of y, substitute the value of z in equation (6):\n\n3i*y - 7(53092 + 3564i) / 17689 = 3i\n\n3i*y = 7(53092 + 3564i) / 17689 + 3i\n\ny = (7(53092 + 3564i) + 3i * 17689) / (3i * 17689)\n\ny = (371644 + 24948i) / 53067i\n\nNow, we have the values of y and z. To find the value of x, substitute the values of y and z in the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(371644 + 24948i) / 53067i + i*(53092 + 3564i) / 17689 = -1\n\n2x = -1 - 3(371644 + 24948i) / 53067i - i*(53092 + 3564i) / 17689\n\nx = (-1/2) * (1 - 3(371644 + 24948i) / 53067i - i*(53092 + 3564i) / 17689)\n\nx = (-53092 + 3564i) / 35378\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = (-53092 + 3564i) / 35378\ny = (371644 + 24948i) / 53067i\nz = (53092 + 3564i) / 17689"
