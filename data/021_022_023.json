    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the behavior of fireflies. It is mainly used for continuous optimization problems. However, it's important to note that as an AI language model, I am unable to execute code or run algorithms in real-time. Instead, I can provide you with an outline of how to approach this problem using the Firefly Algorithm.\n\n1. Initialize the firefly population: Generate a random initial population of fireflies within the given interval [-2, 2]. Each firefly represents a potential solution (x-value) to the problem.\n\n2. Define the attractiveness and light intensity: In the Firefly Algorithm, the attractiveness of a firefly is determined by its light intensity. In this case, the light intensity can be defined as the value of the function f(x) = 1 - x^2. The brighter the firefly (higher f(x) value), the more attractive it is.\n\n3. Set algorithm parameters: Choose the parameters for the algorithm, such as the number of iterations, the absorption coefficient (gamma), and the randomization parameter (beta).\n\n4. Move the fireflies: For each iteration, compare the attractiveness of each firefly to every other firefly. If a firefly is less attractive than another firefly, it will move towards the more attractive firefly. The distance between the fireflies determines the step size of the movement, and the randomization parameter (beta) adds some randomness to the movement.\n\n5. Update the light intensity: After moving the fireflies, update their light intensity based on their new positions (x-values).\n\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the desired number of iterations.\n\n7. Find the best solution: After the final iteration, the firefly with the highest light intensity (maximum f(x) value) represents the best solution to the problem.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = 1 - x^2 over the interval [-2, 2], it is clear that the maximum value occurs at x = 0, where f(x) = 1. In this case, the Firefly Algorithm may not be the most efficient method to find the maximum value, as the problem can be solved analytically. However, the Firefly Algorithm can be useful for more complex optimization problems where an analytical solution is not easily obtainable."
