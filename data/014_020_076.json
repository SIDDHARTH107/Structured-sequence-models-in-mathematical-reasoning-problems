    "message_1": "Here's a possible question for a math student to solve on the topic of cryptanalysis of Vigenere cipher:\n\nSuppose that a message encrypted using Vigenere cipher has been intercepted by an adversary. The encrypted message is \"ILJZB PYDZB NSUCZ ORWTO LTART HGDFV\". The adversary suspects that the keyword used to encrypt the message is a repeating sequence of 4 letters. Find the keyword and decrypt the message.\n\n(Note: The solution involves using frequency analysis and the index of coincidence to determine the length of the keyword, and then using the Kasiski examination method to identify the repeated blocks in the ciphertext and the corresponding letters in the keyword.)",
    "message_2": "Since the adversary suspects that the keyword is a repeating sequence of 4 letters, we can start by dividing the ciphertext into 4 groups, corresponding to each letter of the keyword:\n\nGroup 1: IZPZUOTAH\nGroup 2: LJBSCRWLR\nGroup 3: JYNOAGDF\nGroup 4: ZDZCTTV\n\nNow, we will perform frequency analysis on each group to determine the most likely shift for each letter of the keyword. We will use the English letter frequency to compare.\n\nGroup 1:\nI: 1, Z: 2, P: 1, U: 1, O: 1, T: 1, A: 1, H: 1\nMost frequent letter: Z\n\nGroup 2:\nL: 2, J: 1, B: 1, S: 1, C: 1, R: 1, W: 1\nMost frequent letter: L\n\nGroup 3:\nJ: 1, Y: 1, N: 1, O: 1, A: 1, G: 1, D: 1, F: 1\nMost frequent letter: (tie) J, Y, N, O, A, G, D, F\n\nGroup 4:\nZ: 1, D: 1, C: 1, T: 2, V: 1\nMost frequent letter: T\n\nNow, we will find the shift for each group by comparing the most frequent letter in each group to the most frequent letter in English, which is E.\n\nGroup 1: Z -> E (shift of 1)\nGroup 2: L -> E (shift of 8)\nGroup 3: Since there is a tie, we will try each possibility and see which one makes the most sense.\nGroup 4: T -> E (shift of 15)\n\nNow, we will apply the shifts to each group:\n\nGroup 1: HELLO\nGroup 2: WORLE\nGroup 3: (multiple possibilities)\nGroup 4: DHERE\n\nSince Group 3 has multiple possibilities, we will try each one and see which one makes the most sense when combined with the other groups:\n\nJ -> E (shift of 4): HELLO WORLD HERE\nY -> E (shift of 19): HELLO WORXE MERE\nN -> E (shift of 13): HELLO WORAE KERE\nO -> E (shift of 14): HELLO WORZE JERE\nA -> E (shift of 0): HELLO WORQE IERE\nG -> E (shift of 6): HELLO WORCE GERE\nD -> E (shift of 3): HELLO WORSE FERE\nF -> E (shift of 5): HELLO WORDE DERE\n\nThe most sensible decrypted message is \"HELLO WORLD HERE\". Therefore, the keyword is found by applying the shifts to the letter A:\n\n1 -> B\n8 -> I\n4 -> E\n15 -> P\n\nThe keyword is \"BIEP\"."
