    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first need to convert the system into an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n|  3   2  -1 |  8  |\n|  2  -3   2 | -10 |\n| -1  0.5 -1 |  0.5|\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the x term in the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the first row by 2/3 and add it to the second row, and multiply the first row by 1/3 and add it to the third row:\n\n```\n|  3    2   -1 |  8  |\n|  0   -5    4 | -18 |\n|  0    2   -2 |  3  |\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the y term in the third row.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the second row by 2/5 and add it to the third row:\n\n```\n|  3    2   -1 |  8  |\n|  0   -5    4 | -18 |\n|  0    0   -2 | -2  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nNow we have a triangular system, and we can solve for z by dividing the third row by -2:\n\n```\n|  3    2   -1 |  8  |\n|  0   -5    4 | -18 |\n|  0    0    1 |  1  |\n```\n\nSo, z = 1.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow we can substitute z back into the second row and solve for y:\n\n-5y + 4(1) = -18\n-5y = -22\ny = 22/5\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we can substitute y and z back into the first row and solve for x:\n\n3x + 2(22/5) - 1 = 8\n3x = 8 - 44/5 + 1\n3x = (15 - 44 + 5)/5\n3x = -24/5\nx = -8/5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -8/5, y = 22/5, and z = 1."
