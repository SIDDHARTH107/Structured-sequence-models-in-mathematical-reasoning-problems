    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial approximation of the eigenvector, x^(0) = [1; 1; 1].\n2. Compute the next approximation of the eigenvector, x^(1) = A * x^(0).\n3. Normalize x^(1) to get the new approximation of the eigenvector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's start with the first iteration:\n\nx^(0) = [1; 1; 1]\n\nx^(1) = A * x^(0) = [3 2 2; 2 3 -2; 2 -2 3] * [1; 1; 1] = [7; 3; 3]\n\nNow, normalize x^(1):\n\nx^(1)_normalized = x^(1) / ||x^(1)|| = [7; 3; 3] / sqrt(7^2 + 3^2 + 3^2) = [7; 3; 3] / sqrt(67) ≈ [0.854; 0.366; 0.366]\n\nNow, let's perform the second iteration:\n\nx^(2) = A * x^(1)_normalized ≈ [3 2 2; 2 3 -2; 2 -2 3] * [0.854; 0.366; 0.366] ≈ [4.292; 2.146; 0]\n\nNow, normalize x^(2):\n\nx^(2)_normalized ≈ [4.292; 2.146; 0] / sqrt(4.292^2 + 2.146^2) ≈ [0.894; 0.447; 0]\n\nWe can see that the eigenvector is converging. We can perform more iterations if needed, but for this example, we will stop here. The dominant eigenvalue can be found by computing the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nλ = (x^(2)_normalized)' * A * x^(2)_normalized ≈ [0.894; 0.447; 0]' * [3 2 2; 2 3 -2; 2 -2 3] * [0.894; 0.447; 0] ≈ 5.999\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately λ ≈ 6, and its corresponding eigenvector is approximately x ≈ [0.894; 0.447; 0]."
