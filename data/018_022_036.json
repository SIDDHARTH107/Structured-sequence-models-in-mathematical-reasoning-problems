    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {3}\nA △ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B △ A.\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ∩ A = {3}\nB △ A = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNotice that A △ B = B △ A = {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and (B △ A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A △ B) x (B △ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nSince A △ B = B △ A, the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and (B △ A) is the same as the Cartesian product of (B △ A) and (A △ B).\n\n(B △ A) x (A △ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nTherefore, (A △ B) x (B △ A) = (B △ A) x (A △ B), and the two sets are equal."
