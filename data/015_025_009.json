    "message_2": "The period of the motion of a forced van der Pol oscillator can be determined by the driving frequency. The driving frequency (ω) is given as 1.5. To find the period (T) of the motion, we can use the following formula:\n\nT = 2π / ω\n\nPlugging in the given driving frequency:\n\nT = 2π / 1.5\n\nT ≈ 4.18879\n\nTherefore, the period of the motion of the forced van der Pol oscillator corresponding to a driving frequency of 1.5 and a damping parameter of 0.2 is approximately 4.18879 units."
