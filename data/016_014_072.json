    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, there are N = 4 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of s = 1/√2.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/√2)\n\nD ≈ 2.000\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 2."
