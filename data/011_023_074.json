    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of G, we can use the concept of graph coloring and the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 6 vertices and a degree sequence of 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3. This means that there are two vertices with a degree of 3 (connected to 3 other vertices) and four vertices with a degree of 2 (connected to 2 other vertices).\n\nSince there are vertices with a degree of 3, it is clear that at least 3 colors are needed to color the graph, as each of these vertices will be connected to 3 other vertices, and they all need to have different colors.\n\nNow, let's see if it's possible to color the graph with 3 colors. We can construct the graph as follows:\n\n1. Let the vertices be A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n2. Connect A to B, C, and D (degree 3 for A).\n3. Connect E to B, C, and F (degree 3 for E).\n4. Connect B to D (degree 2 for B, C, D, and F).\n\nNow we can try to color the graph using 3 colors:\n\n- Color A with color 1.\n- Color B with color 2.\n- Color C with color 3.\n- Color D with color 3.\n- Color E with color 1.\n- Color F with color 2.\n\nAs we can see, it is possible to color the graph with 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of G is 3."
