    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a student to solve in the context of solving optimization problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer:\n\nA company wants to optimize its production process by minimizing the costs of transportation of goods from four different factories to three warehouses. The cost of transportation per unit from each factory to each warehouse is provided in the table below:\n\n|           | Warehouse 1 | Warehouse 2 | Warehouse 3 |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Factory 1 | 12          | 9           | 15          |\n| Factory 2 | 8           | 11          | 10          |\n| Factory 3 | 14          | 5           | 8           |\n| Factory 4 | 7           | 13          | 16          |\n\nThe company wants to transport a total of 90 units to the three warehouses. Using Grey Wolf Optimizer, what is the minimum cost of transportation?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the GWO parameters: number of wolves (population size), number of iterations, and search space dimensions.\n2. Define the objective function: the total cost of transportation.\n3. Implement the GWO algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume we have 20 wolves and 100 iterations. The search space dimensions are 12 (4 factories * 3 warehouses).\n\nNow, let's define the objective function:\n\nCost = (12 * x1) + (9 * x2) + (15 * x3) + (8 * x4) + (11 * x5) + (10 * x6) + (14 * x7) + (5 * x8) + (8 * x9) + (7 * x10) + (13 * x11) + (16 * x12)\n\nwhere x1 to x12 represent the number of units transported from each factory to each warehouse.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. The total number of units transported to the warehouses is 90.\n2. The number of units transported from each factory to each warehouse must be non-negative.\n\nAfter implementing the GWO algorithm with the given parameters and constraints, we will obtain the optimal solution for the transportation problem. Since the GWO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, the solution may not be the exact minimum cost, but it will be close to the minimum cost.\n\nPlease note that solving this problem using GWO requires programming skills and the use of a suitable programming language (e.g., Python, MATLAB, etc.)."
