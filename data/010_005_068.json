    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information. We know that every continuous map from X to {0,1} is constant, which means that X cannot be separated into disjoint open sets that map to 0 and 1. This implies that X is connected.\n\nHowever, we are also given that X has 5 connected components. This means that X can be partitioned into 5 disjoint non-empty subsets, each of which is connected.\n\nSince each connected component must have at least one element, the minimum number of elements in X is the sum of the minimum number of elements in each connected component. In this case, that would be 1 element per connected component, for a total of 5 elements.\n\nSo, the minimum number of elements in X is 5."
