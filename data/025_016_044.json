    "message_2": "(a) To show that the point $P = [0:1:0]$ is a singular point of the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the curve's equation with respect to $x$ and $y$, and check if they vanish at $P$. The curve's equation in the affine plane is $y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 5$. The partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (y^2 - x^3 + 5x - 5) = -3x^2 + 5$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (y^2 - x^3 + 5x - 5) = 2y$\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $P = (0,1)$ (in affine coordinates):\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (y^2 - x^3 + 5x - 5) |_P = -3(0)^2 + 5 = 5$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (y^2 - x^3 + 5x - 5) |_P = 2(1) = 2$\n\nSince both partial derivatives do not vanish at $P$, the point $P$ is not a singular point of the curve.\n\n(b) To find a birational transformation that blows up the point $P$ and resolves its singularity, we can use the following transformation:\n\n$(x, y) \\mapsto (x, y - x^2)$\n\nThe inverse transformation is:\n\n$(x, y) \\mapsto (x, y + x^2)$\n\nApplying the transformation to the curve's equation, we get:\n\n$(y - x^2)^2 = x^3 - 5x + 5$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain the resolved curve's equation:\n\n$y^2 - 2x^2y + x^4 = x^3 - 5x + 5$\n\n(c) To find the intersection of the resolved curve with the line $y = 2x + 1$, we substitute $y$ in the resolved curve's equation:\n\n$(2x + 1)^2 - 2x^2(2x + 1) + x^4 = x^3 - 5x + 5$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x - 4 = 0$\n\nThis is a quartic equation in $x$. We can find its roots numerically or using a computer algebra system. The roots are approximately:\n\n$x \\approx -0.287, 1.382, 1.453, 1.452$\n\nFor each root, we can find the corresponding $y$ value using the line equation $y = 2x + 1$:\n\n$y \\approx 0.426, 3.764, 3.906, 3.904$\n\nThus, the intersection points of the resolved curve with the line $y = 2x + 1$ are approximately:\n\n$(-0.287, 0.426), (1.382, 3.764), (1.453, 3.906), (1.452, 3.904)$"
