    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem involving block ciphers: \n\nSuppose you have a message consisting of 64 bits that you want to encrypt using a block cipher with a key length of 56 bits. If the block cipher has 16 rounds and uses substitution-permutation networks for each round, what is the total number of operations required to encrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total number of operations required to encrypt the message, we need to consider the operations involved in each round of the block cipher. In a substitution-permutation network, there are two main operations: substitution (S-boxes) and permutation (P-boxes).\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n\n1. Key generation: Since the key length is 56 bits, there will be some operations required to generate the round keys for each of the 16 rounds. However, the exact number of operations depends on the specific key scheduling algorithm used by the block cipher, which is not provided in the problem statement. So, we will not consider key generation operations in our calculation.\n\n2. Substitution (S-boxes): The substitution operation typically involves replacing each bit or group of bits with another bit or group of bits according to a predefined substitution table. The number of operations required for substitution depends on the number of S-boxes and the size of each S-box. However, the problem statement does not provide this information. So, we will assume that there are 's' substitution operations per round.\n\n3. Permutation (P-boxes): The permutation operation involves rearranging the bits according to a predefined permutation pattern. The number of operations required for permutation depends on the number of P-boxes and the size of each P-box. However, the problem statement does not provide this information. So, we will assume that there are 'p' permutation operations per round.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of operations for all 16 rounds:\n\nTotal operations = (s + p) * 16\n\nSince we don't have the exact values for 's' and 'p', we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, the formula above can be used to calculate the total number of operations once the substitution and permutation operation counts are known."
