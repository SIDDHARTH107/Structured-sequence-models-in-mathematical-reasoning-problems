    "message_1": "Suppose a signal has a frequency content that can be described by the function f(t) = 5sin(6πt) + 3cos(10πt) + 2sin(20πt). Use the Fourier transform to calculate the amplitude and phase of each frequency component in the signal.",
    "message_2": "The given function is f(t) = 5sin(6πt) + 3cos(10πt) + 2sin(20πt). We can rewrite this function in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) / (2i)\ncos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ)) / 2\n\nSo, f(t) can be rewritten as:\n\nf(t) = 5/2i (e^(i6πt) - e^(-i6πt)) + 3/2 (e^(i10πt) + e^(-i10πt)) + 2/2i (e^(i20πt) - e^(-i20πt))\n\nNow, we can see that f(t) is a sum of complex exponentials. The Fourier transform of f(t) will give us the amplitude and phase of each frequency component in the signal.\n\nThe Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n\nSince f(t) is a sum of complex exponentials, we can compute the Fourier transform of each term separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's compute the Fourier transform of each term:\n\n1. For the first term, 5/2i (e^(i6πt) - e^(-i6πt)):\n\nF1(ω) = 5/2i ∫[(e^(i6πt) - e^(-i6πt)) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n       = 5/2i [∫(e^(i(6π-ω)t) dt - ∫(e^(i(-6π-ω)t) dt]\n\nThe integral will be non-zero only when ω = ±6π. So, we have:\n\nF1(ω) = 5/2i [δ(ω - 6π) - δ(ω + 6π)]\n\n2. For the second term, 3/2 (e^(i10πt) + e^(-i10πt)):\n\nF2(ω) = 3/2 ∫[(e^(i10πt) + e^(-i10πt)) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n       = 3/2 [∫(e^(i(10π-ω)t) dt + ∫(e^(i(-10π-ω)t) dt]\n\nThe integral will be non-zero only when ω = ±10π. So, we have:\n\nF2(ω) = 3/2 [δ(ω - 10π) + δ(ω + 10π)]\n\n3. For the third term, 2/2i (e^(i20πt) - e^(-i20πt)):\n\nF3(ω) = 1/i ∫[(e^(i20πt) - e^(-i20πt)) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n       = 1/i [∫(e^(i(20π-ω)t) dt - ∫(e^(i(-20π-ω)t) dt]\n\nThe integral will be non-zero only when ω = ±20π. So, we have:\n\nF3(ω) = 1/i [δ(ω - 20π) - δ(ω + 20π)]\n\nNow, we can add up the Fourier transforms of each term to get the Fourier transform of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) + F3(ω)\n     = 5/2i [δ(ω - 6π) - δ(ω + 6π)] + 3/2 [δ(ω - 10π) + δ(ω + 10π)] + 1/i [δ(ω - 20π) - δ(ω + 20π)]\n\nFrom the Fourier transform, we can see that there are three frequency components in the signal:\n\n1. ω = ±6π with amplitude 5 and phase -90° (since it's multiplied by 1/2i)\n2. ω = ±10π with amplitude 3 and phase 0° (since it's multiplied by 3/2)\n3. ω = ±20π with amplitude 2 and phase -90° (since it's multiplied by 1/i)\n\nSo, the amplitude and phase of each frequency component in the signal are:\n\n1. Amplitude: 5, Phase: -90°\n2. Amplitude: 3, Phase: 0°\n3. Amplitude: 2, Phase: -90°"
