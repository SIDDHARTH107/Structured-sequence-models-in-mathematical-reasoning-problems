    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 5cos(x) - 3sin(x) on the interval [0, 2π], we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = -5sin(x) - 3cos(x)\n\n2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = -5sin(x) - 3cos(x)\n\n3. To solve this equation, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(α - β) = sin(α)cos(β) - cos(α)sin(β)\n\nLet α = x and β = arctan(5/3). Then, we have:\n\n0 = -3sin(x)cos(arctan(5/3)) - 5cos(x)sin(arctan(5/3))\n\n0 = sin(x - arctan(5/3))\n\n4. The solutions for x are:\n\nx = arctan(5/3) + kπ, where k is an integer.\n\n5. Since we are looking for the maximum value on the interval [0, 2π], we can choose k = 0 and k = 1:\n\nx1 = arctan(5/3)\nx2 = arctan(5/3) + π\n\n6. Evaluate the function at these points:\n\nf(x1) = 5cos(arctan(5/3)) - 3sin(arctan(5/3))\nf(x2) = 5cos(arctan(5/3) + π) - 3sin(arctan(5/3) + π)\n\n7. Determine the maximum value:\n\nmax(f(x1), f(x2))\n\nAfter calculating the values, we find that the maximum value of the function f(x) = 5cos(x) - 3sin(x) on the interval [0, 2π] is approximately 5.83."
