    "message_2": "To find the value of y when x = 2, we need to solve the differential equation and apply the initial condition y(0) = 1.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n\ndy/dx = x^2\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(dy) = ∫(x^2 dx)\n\ny = (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n1 = (1/3)(0)^3 + C\n\n1 = C\n\nSo, the particular solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny = (1/3)x^3 + 1\n\nNow, we find the value of y when x = 2:\n\ny = (1/3)(2)^3 + 1\n\ny = (1/3)(8) + 1\n\ny = 8/3 + 1\n\ny = 11/3\n\nTherefore, the value of y when x = 2 is y = 11/3."
