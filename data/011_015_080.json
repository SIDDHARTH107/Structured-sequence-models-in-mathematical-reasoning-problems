    "message_1": "In a football match between two teams, there are 22 players on the field. What is the minimum number of players from one team that must score a goal to ensure that there are at least 3 players who scored for the same team or at least 4 players who scored for the other team? (Hint: Use Ramsey's theorem)",
    "message_2": "Using Ramsey's theorem, we can solve this problem by finding the minimum number of players that must score a goal to guarantee that either at least 3 players from one team or at least 4 players from the other team have scored.\n\nLet's denote the two teams as Team A and Team B. We will use the notation R(m, n) to represent the minimum number of players that must score a goal to guarantee that either at least m players from Team A or at least n players from Team B have scored. In this case, we want to find R(3, 4).\n\nTo find R(3, 4), we can use the recursive formula for Ramsey's theorem:\n\nR(m, n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1) - 1\n\nFirst, we need to find the base cases:\n\nR(1, n) = n (since if one player from Team A scores, then there must be at least n players from Team B who scored)\nR(m, 1) = m (similarly, if one player from Team B scores, then there must be at least m players from Team A who scored)\n\nNow we can find R(3, 4) using the recursive formula:\n\nR(3, 4) = R(2, 4) + R(3, 3) - 1\n\nTo find R(2, 4) and R(3, 3), we need to use the recursive formula again:\n\nR(2, 4) = R(1, 4) + R(2, 3) - 1 = 4 + R(2, 3) - 1\nR(3, 3) = R(2, 3) + R(3, 2) - 1\n\nNow we need to find R(2, 3):\n\nR(2, 3) = R(1, 3) + R(2, 2) - 1 = 3 + R(2, 2) - 1\n\nTo find R(2, 2), we use the base cases:\n\nR(2, 2) = R(1, 2) + R(2, 1) - 1 = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the equation for R(2, 3):\n\nR(2, 3) = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5\n\nNow we can substitute R(2, 3) back into the equations for R(2, 4) and R(3, 3):\n\nR(2, 4) = 4 + 5 - 1 = 8\nR(3, 3) = 5 + R(3, 2) - 1 = 5 + 5 - 1 = 9\n\nFinally, we can substitute these values back into the equation for R(3, 4):\n\nR(3, 4) = 8 + 9 - 1 = 16\n\nSo, the minimum number of players from one team that must score a goal to ensure that there are at least 3 players who scored for the same team or at least 4 players who scored for the other team is 16."
