    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 5, we first need to find its first derivative and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x - 9\n\nNow, set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx = 3, -1\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 3 and x = -1.\n\nNow, we need to determine the nature of these critical points by analyzing the second derivative of the function.\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 6\n\nEvaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 6 = 12 > 0\nf''(-1) = 6(-1) - 6 = -12 < 0\n\nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point x = 3 is a relative minimum.\nSince f''(-1) < 0, the critical point x = -1 is a relative maximum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 5 has a relative minimum at x = 3 and a relative maximum at x = -1. Note that there are no saddle points in this case, as saddle points are a concept related to functions of two or more variables."
