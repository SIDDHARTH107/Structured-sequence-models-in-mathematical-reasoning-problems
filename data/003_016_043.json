    "message_2": "The general form of a sinusoidal function is f(x) = A*sin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn the given function f(x) = 4sin(4x - π/3), we can see that A = 4, B = 4, and C = π/3.\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to determine the value of x when the argument of the sine function is zero. In other words, we need to solve the equation:\n\n4x - π/3 = 0\n\nNow, isolate x:\n\n4x = π/3\n\nx = (π/3) / 4\n\nx = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function is π/12."
