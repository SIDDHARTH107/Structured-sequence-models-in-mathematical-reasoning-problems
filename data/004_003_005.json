    "message_2": "To maximize the area of the rectangular garden, we can use calculus to find the dimensions. Let the length of the garden be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the garden is given by:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 100 meters of fencing:\n\n100 = 2L + 2W\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n50 = L + W\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area A of the garden, which is given by:\n\nA = L * W\n\nWe can express W in terms of L using the perimeter equation:\n\nW = 50 - L\n\nNow substitute this expression for W into the area equation:\n\nA(L) = L * (50 - L)\n\nA(L) = 50L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of A(L) with respect to L and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dL = 50 - 2L = 0\n\nSolve for L:\n\n2L = 50\nL = 25\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 50 - 25 = 25\n\nSo, the dimensions that maximize the area of the garden are 25 meters by 25 meters, which is a square. The maximum area is:\n\nA = 25 * 25 = 625 square meters."
