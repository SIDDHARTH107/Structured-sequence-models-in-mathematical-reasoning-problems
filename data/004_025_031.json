    "message_1": "A car is traveling at 60 mph and the driver applies the brakes, causing the car to decelerate at a rate of 20 ft/s^2. Assuming the car's initial distance from a stop sign was 2000 ft, how far does the car travel before coming to a complete stop? Use calculus to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using calculus, we need to find the position function of the car, which will give us the distance traveled before coming to a complete stop. We are given the initial velocity (60 mph) and the deceleration rate (20 ft/s^2). \n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial velocity from miles per hour to feet per second. There are 5280 feet in a mile and 3600 seconds in an hour, so:\n\n60 mph * (5280 ft/mile) / (3600 s/hour) = 88 ft/s\n\nNow we have the initial velocity in ft/s: v0 = 88 ft/s.\n\nThe deceleration rate is given as 20 ft/s^2, which is the second derivative of the position function. Since the car is decelerating, the acceleration is negative:\n\na(t) = -20 ft/s^2\n\nTo find the velocity function, we integrate the acceleration function with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫(-20) dt = -20t + C1\n\nTo find the constant C1, we use the initial velocity:\n\nv(0) = 88 ft/s = -20(0) + C1\nC1 = 88\n\nSo the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = -20t + 88\n\nNow, we integrate the velocity function to find the position function:\n\ns(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-20t + 88) dt = -10t^2 + 88t + C2\n\nTo find the constant C2, we use the initial position:\n\ns(0) = 2000 ft = -10(0)^2 + 88(0) + C2\nC2 = 2000\n\nSo the position function is:\n\ns(t) = -10t^2 + 88t + 2000\n\nTo find the distance traveled before coming to a complete stop, we need to find the time when the car's velocity is 0:\n\n0 = -20t + 88\nt = 88/20 = 4.4 seconds\n\nNow, we plug this time into the position function to find the final position:\n\ns(4.4) = -10(4.4)^2 + 88(4.4) + 2000 ≈ 1934.4 ft\n\nFinally, we subtract the initial position from the final position to find the distance traveled:\n\nDistance = Final position - Initial position = 1934.4 ft - 2000 ft ≈ -65.6 ft\n\nSince the distance is negative, it means the car does not come to a complete stop before reaching the stop sign. It overshoots the stop sign by approximately 65.6 feet."
