    "message_2": "To form a 5-letter word using the letters of the word \"COMPUTING,\" we need to consider the number of unique letters and repetitions.\n\nThe word \"COMPUTING\" has 9 letters, but there are only 8 unique letters since \"T\" is repeated twice. \n\nWe can use the formula for permutations with repetition: n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of objects (letters in this case) and n1, n2, ... nk are the number of repetitions of each object.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (since we want to form a 5-letter word), and there is only one repetition (T) with n1 = 2.\n\nSo, the formula becomes: 5! / (2!)\n\nNow, calculate the factorials:\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n2! = 2 × 1 = 2\n\nNow, divide 5! by 2!:\n\n120 / 2 = 60\n\nSo, there are 60 different 5-letter words that can be formed using the letters of the word \"COMPUTING.\""
