    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the space of global sections of $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the degree of the divisor $D$. Since $D$ is linearly equivalent to $3p_1 + 4p_2 - 2p_3 - 6p_4$, we have:\n\n$\\deg(D) = 3 + 4 - 2 - 6 = -1$\n\nNext, we need to find the canonical divisor $K_C$. For a plane curve of degree $d$, the canonical divisor has degree $K_C = (d - 2)(d - 1)$. In our case, $d = 5$, so:\n\n$\\deg(K_C) = (5 - 2)(5 - 1) = 3 \\cdot 4 = 12$\n\nNow we can compute $l(K_C - D)$. Since $K_C - D$ has degree $12 - (-1) = 13$, by the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$l(K_C - D) - l(K_C - (K_C - D)) = \\deg(K_C - D) + 1 - g$\n\n$l(K_C - D) - l(D) = 13 + 1 - 2$\n\n$l(K_C - D) - l(D) = 12$\n\nSince we want to find $l(D)$, we can rearrange the equation:\n\n$l(D) = l(K_C - D) - 12$\n\nNow we need to find $l(K_C - D)$. Notice that $\\deg(K_C - D) = 13 > 2g = 4$, so by the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$l(K_C - D) = \\deg(K_C - D) + 1 - g = 13 + 1 - 2 = 12$\n\nFinally, we can find $l(D)$:\n\n$l(D) = l(K_C - D) - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0$\n\nSo the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$ is 0."
