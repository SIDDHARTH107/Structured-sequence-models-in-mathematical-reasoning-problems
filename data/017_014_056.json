    "message_2": "There are no distinct isomorphisms between a non-abelian group of order 20 and the cyclic group C20. \n\nThe reason is that isomorphisms preserve the group structure, and the structure of a non-abelian group is fundamentally different from that of an abelian group. Since the cyclic group C20 is abelian (all cyclic groups are abelian), there cannot be any isomorphisms between a non-abelian group of order 20 and C20."
