Suppose the string is of length $L$, fixed at both ends, and initially at rest with $u(x,0) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$.\n\nFind the Fourier series representation of the solution $u(x,t)$, and use it to determine the displacement of the string at position $x=\\frac{L}{4}$ and time $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2c}\\sqrt{2}$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the given equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t).$$\n\nDividing both sides by $c^2 X(x)T(t)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}.$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0$$\n$$T''(t) + c^2 k^2 T(t) = 0.$$\n\nNow, we solve these equations with the given boundary and initial conditions. For $X(x)$, we have:\n\n$$X(0) = X(L) = 0.$$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx).$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $B = 0$ and $A\\sin(kL) = 0$. Since $A \\neq 0$, we must have $\\sin(kL) = 0$, which implies $k = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right).$$\n\nFor $T(t)$, the general solution is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\sin(c kt) + D\\cos(c kt).$$\n\nSince $u(x,0) = 0$, we have $X(x)T(0) = 0$, which implies $D = 0$. Moreover, since $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$, we have $X(x)T'(0) = 0$. Differentiating $T(t)$ with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$$T'(t) = c k C\\cos(c kt).$$\n\nThus, $T'(0) = ckC$, and since $T'(0) = 0$, we have $C = 0$ for $n = 2, 4, 6, \\dots$ and $C \\neq 0$ for $n = 1, 3, 5, \\dots$. Therefore, the solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T_n(t) = B_n\\sin\\left(c\\frac{n\\pi t}{L}\\right)$$ for $n = 1, 3, 5, \\dots$.\n\nNow, we can write the solution $u(x,t)$ as a sum of the product of $X_n(x)$ and $T_n(t)$:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots} A_n B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(c\\frac{n\\pi t}{L}\\right).$$\n\nTo find the displacement of the string at position $x = \\frac{L}{4}$ and time $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2c}\\sqrt{2}$, we substitute these values into the solution:\n\n$$u\\left(\\frac{L}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{2c}\\sqrt{2}\\right) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,\\dots} A_n B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{4}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\sqrt{2}\\right).$$\n\nHowever, we notice that $\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\sqrt{2}\\right) = 0$ for all odd $n$, so the displacement of the string at this position and time is:\n\n$$u\\left(\\frac{L}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{2c}\\sqrt{2}\\right) = 0.$$"
