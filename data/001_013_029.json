    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(x-1) = 3, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(x-1))^2 = 3^2\n\nNow, we simplify:\n\nx-1 = 9\n\nNext, we isolate x by adding 1 to both sides:\n\nx = 9 + 1\n\nFinally, we find the value of x:\n\nx = 10"
