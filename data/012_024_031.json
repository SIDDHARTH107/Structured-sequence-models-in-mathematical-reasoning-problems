    "message_2": "Euler's formula for a connected planar graph is given by:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this problem, we have V = 12 and E = 20. We want to determine the genus of the graph, which is the minimum number of \"handles\" that need to be added to a sphere to embed the graph without any edge crossings.\n\nFirst, let's check if the graph is planar. If it is planar, then the genus is 0. To check if the graph is planar, we can use the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nFor our graph, we have:\n\n20 ≤ 3(12) - 6\n20 ≤ 36 - 6\n20 ≤ 30\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, we need to check if it satisfies the condition for planarity based on Euler's formula. If we can find the value of F that satisfies the formula, then the graph is planar.\n\nLet's rewrite Euler's formula with the given values:\n\n12 - 20 + F = 2\n\nNow, solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - 12 + 20\nF = 10\n\nSince we found a valid value for F, the graph is indeed planar. Therefore, the genus of the graph is 0."
