    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. The distributive law of the symmetric difference states that A △ (B ∪ C) = (A △ B) ∪ (A △ C).\n\nFirst, let's find A △ B:\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) ∪ C:\n(A △ B) ∪ C = {1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSo, (A △ B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 4, 5}."
