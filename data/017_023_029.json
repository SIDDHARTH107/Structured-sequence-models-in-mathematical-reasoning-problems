    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Determine the possible divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n3. Use the formula for the number of abelian groups of order n: n(G) = p(n) * p(m), where p(n) is the number of partitions of n and G is the group of order n. In this case, n = 72, so we have:\n   - p(2^3) = p(8) = 4 (partitions: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1, 2+1+1+1+1+1+1, 2+2+1+1+1, 2+2+2+1)\n   - p(3^2) = p(9) = 2 (partitions: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1, 3+1+1+1+1+1)\n   - n(G) = 4 * 2 = 8 abelian groups of order 72\n4. Determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 72. This can be done by considering the possible structures of the groups and using the Sylow theorems. After analyzing the possibilities, we find that there are 7 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nSo, there are a total of 8 abelian groups and 7 non-abelian groups, making 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
