    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 48 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (48) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n   48 รท 36 = 1 with a remainder of 12.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (48) with the smaller number (36), and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 36 and 12.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (36) by the new smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n   36 รท 12 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 36 and 48 using the Euclidean algorithm is 12."
