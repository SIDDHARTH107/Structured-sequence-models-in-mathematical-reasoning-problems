    "message_1": "What is the probability that in a country with a population of 10 million people, exactly 500,000 people will vote for a specific political party in the upcoming election, given that the historical data shows that, on average, 5% of the population tend to vote for this party in past elections, with a standard deviation of 2%?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability, we can use the normal distribution. First, we need to calculate the z-score for the given situation. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the number of people voting for the party (500,000), μ is the mean (5% of 10 million = 500,000), and σ is the standard deviation (2% of 10 million = 200,000).\n\nz = (500,000 - 500,000) / 200,000\nz = 0\n\nNow, we can look up the probability for a z-score of 0 in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator with a normal distribution function. The probability for a z-score of 0 is 0.5 or 50%. However, this is the probability of getting a result less than or equal to 500,000 votes.\n\nSince the question asks for the probability of exactly 500,000 votes, we need to consider a small range around 500,000 votes. For example, we can calculate the probability of getting between 499,500 and 500,500 votes.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the z-scores for 499,500 and 500,500:\n\nz1 = (499,500 - 500,000) / 200,000\nz1 = -0.0025\n\nz2 = (500,500 - 500,000) / 200,000\nz2 = 0.0025\n\nNow, we can find the probabilities for these z-scores using a standard normal distribution table or calculator:\n\nP(z1) = 0.4990\nP(z2) = 0.5010\n\nThe probability of getting exactly 500,000 votes is the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(exactly 500,000 votes) = P(z2) - P(z1)\nP(exactly 500,000 votes) = 0.5010 - 0.4990\nP(exactly 500,000 votes) = 0.0020\n\nSo, the probability of exactly 500,000 people voting for the specific political party is 0.0020 or 0.20%."
