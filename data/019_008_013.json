    "message_1": "A grocery store is ordering tomatoes with a fuzzy quality rating system. The supplier has rated the tomatoes from 0 to 1, where 1 represents the highest quality. The store manager wants to order tomatoes with a quality rating of at least 0.6. If the supplier delivers a shipment with 1000 tomatoes, but the quality rating is only 0.45, how many tomatoes should the store manager discard? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "The store manager wants tomatoes with a quality rating of at least 0.6, but the shipment has a quality rating of 0.45. To find the difference in quality rating, subtract the shipment's quality rating from the desired quality rating:\n\n0.6 - 0.45 = 0.15\n\nThis means the shipment is 0.15 below the desired quality rating. To find the proportion of tomatoes that should be discarded, divide the difference in quality rating by the desired quality rating:\n\n0.15 / 0.6 = 0.25\n\nThis means that 25% of the tomatoes should be discarded. To find the number of tomatoes to discard, multiply the total number of tomatoes by the proportion to discard:\n\n1000 * 0.25 = 250\n\nThe store manager should discard 250 tomatoes."
