    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar, we can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on two sets of 3 vertices).\n\nFirst, let's count the number of vertices and edges in the graph G. There are 6 vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F) and 9 edges.\n\nNow, let's check for subdivisions of K5 and K3,3.\n\n1. K5: A complete graph on 5 vertices would have 10 edges, which is more than the number of edges in G (9 edges). Therefore, G cannot contain a subdivision of K5.\n\n2. K3,3: A complete bipartite graph on two sets of 3 vertices would have 9 edges, which is equal to the number of edges in G. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that there is no such subgraph in G. For example, vertex A is connected to vertices B, C, and D, but not to E and F. Similarly, vertex E is connected to vertices B, C, and F, but not to A and D. Therefore, G does not contain a subdivision of K3,3.\n\nSince G does not contain a subdivision of K5 or K3,3, we can conclude that the graph G is planar."
