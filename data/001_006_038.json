    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 4x - 3 and find the vertex, axis of symmetry, and y-intercept of the parabola, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the coefficients a, b, and c in the equation y = ax^2 + bx + c.\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -3.\n\n2. Find the vertex (h, k) using the formula h = -b / 2a and k = f(h).\nh = -4 / (2 * 2) = -4 / 4 = -1\nk = f(-1) = 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1) - 3 = 2 - 4 - 3 = -5\nSo, the vertex is (-1, -5).\n\n3. Find the axis of symmetry using the formula x = h.\nIn this case, the axis of symmetry is x = -1.\n\n4. Find the y-intercept by setting x = 0 and solving for y.\ny = 2(0)^2 + 4(0) - 3 = -3\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -3).\n\nNow, we have all the necessary information to graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 4x - 3:\n\n- The vertex is (-1, -5).\n- The axis of symmetry is x = -1.\n- The y-intercept is (0, -3).\n\nYou can plot these points and the axis of symmetry on a graph to visualize the parabola."
