    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 8 cm and l = 11 cm.\n\nSurface Area = π(8)(8 + 11)\nSurface Area = π(8)(19)\nSurface Area ≈ 3.14 × 8 × 19\nSurface Area ≈ 3.14 × 152\nSurface Area ≈ 477.44\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth, the surface area of the cone is approximately 477.4 square centimeters."
