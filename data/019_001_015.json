    "message_2": "Given that P is true and Q is false, we can determine the truth values of the given propositions as follows:\n\na) (P ∧ Q) - This proposition represents \"P and Q.\" Since P is true and Q is false, the entire proposition is false because both parts need to be true for the \"and\" statement to be true.\n\nb) (P ∨ Q) - This proposition represents \"P or Q.\" Since P is true and Q is false, the entire proposition is true because only one part needs to be true for the \"or\" statement to be true.\n\nc) (¬ P ∧ ¬ Q) - This proposition represents \"not P and not Q.\" Since P is true, ¬ P is false. Since Q is false, ¬ Q is true. The entire proposition is false because both parts need to be true for the \"and\" statement to be true, but ¬ P is false."
