Show that $[\\omega] = 0$ in $H^k_{dR}(M)$ if $k > n$. \n\nMoreover, consider the specific case where $M$ is the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

    "message_2": "First, we prove that $[\\omega] = 0$ in $H^k_{dR}(M)$ if $k > n$. Since $\\omega$ is a closed $k$-form with compact support, we have $d\\omega = 0$. Now, consider the Poincaré lemma, which states that for any closed $k$-form $\\alpha$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with compact support, there exists a $(k-1)$-form $\\beta$ such that $\\alpha = d\\beta$. Since $k > n$, we have $k-1 \\geq n$, and thus the Poincaré lemma implies that $\\omega$ is exact. Therefore, $[\\omega] = 0$ in $H^k_{dR}(M)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case where $M = \\mathbb{S}^n$. We have $\\omega = f(\\theta, \\phi) d\\theta \\wedge d\\phi$ as a $2$-form on $\\mathbb{S}^2$. Since $\\mathbb{S}^2$ has dimension $2$, we can apply the result from the first part of the problem to conclude that $[\\omega] = 0$ in $H^2_{dR}(\\mathbb{S}^2)$."
