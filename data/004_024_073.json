    "message_2": "First, let's differentiate the given equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nThe equation is x^2 + y^2 = 25.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\nd(x^2)/dx + d(y^2)/dx = d(25)/dx\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0)\n\nNow, we are given that x = 3 and dy/dx = -2/3. Let's plug these values into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(3) + 2y(-2/3) = 0\n\n6 - 4/3*y = 0\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\n4/3*y = 6\n\ny = (3/4)*6\n\ny = 9/2\n\nSo, the value of y is 9/2 or 4.5."
