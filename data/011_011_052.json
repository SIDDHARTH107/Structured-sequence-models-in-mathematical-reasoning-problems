    "message_1": "A group of 10 students is preparing for a math contest. The group wants to form two teams, Team A and Team B, each consisting of 5 students. In how many ways can the students be divided into two teams?",
    "message_2": "To divide the 10 students into two teams of 5, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students and k is the number of students in each team.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 5. So, we have:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nHowever, since the teams are indistinguishable (i.e., Team A and Team B are the same), we need to divide the result by 2 to avoid counting the same team division twice.\n\nSo, the number of ways to divide the students into two teams is 252 / 2 = 126."
