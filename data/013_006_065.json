    "message_1": "There are two hunters in the forest who can either hunt a stag or a rabbit. Hunting a stag requires cooperation, and if both hunters hunt a stag, they can each receive 10 points. Hunting a rabbit does not require cooperation, and each hunter can receive 5 points for hunting a rabbit individually. However, if one hunter chooses to hunt a stag and the other chooses to hunt a rabbit, the hunter who chased after the stag gets zero points because hunting a stag alone is impossible.\n\nThe payoffs can be presented in this way:\n\n|           | Hunter 2 hunts a stag | Hunter 2 hunts a rabbit |\n|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Hunter 1 hunts a stag | 10, 10 | 0, 5 |\n| Hunter 1 hunts a rabbit | 5, 0 | 5, 5 |\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium in this game?",
    "message_2": "The Nash equilibrium in this game is when both hunters choose to hunt a rabbit. In this case, both hunters receive 5 points each (5, 5). This is a Nash equilibrium because neither hunter has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. If either hunter decides to switch to hunting a stag, they would receive 0 points, which is worse than the 5 points they receive for hunting a rabbit."
