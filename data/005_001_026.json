    "message_1": "A medical study claims that a new drug can decrease a patient's blood pressure by an average of 10 mmHg. To test this claim, a group of 32 patients were selected from a population and given the new drug. After one month, their blood pressure was measured and the sample mean was found to be 7 mmHg with a standard deviation of 3 mmHg. \n\nUsing a 5% level of significance, can we accept the claim that the new drug reduces blood pressure by an average of 10 mmHg? \n\nThe student has to perform a hypothesis test and find out if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, which will enable them to accept or reject the null hypothesis.",
    "message_2": "To perform the hypothesis test, we first set up our null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The drug reduces blood pressure by an average of 10 mmHg (µ = 10)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The drug does not reduce blood pressure by an average of 10 mmHg (µ ≠ 10)\n\nWe are given the following information:\nSample mean (x̄) = 7 mmHg\nSample standard deviation (s) = 3 mmHg\nSample size (n) = 32 patients\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is large enough (n > 30), we can use the z-test to perform the hypothesis test. First, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = s / √n\nSE = 3 / √32\nSE ≈ 0.53\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (x̄ - µ) / SE\nz = (7 - 10) / 0.53\nz ≈ -5.66\n\nNow, we need to find the p-value associated with this z-score. Using a z-table or calculator, we find that the p-value is approximately 0.000015.\n\nSince the p-value (0.000015) is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This means that we have enough evidence to conclude that the new drug does not reduce blood pressure by an average of 10 mmHg at the 5% level of significance."
