    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces three types of products: A, B and C. The percentage of each type of product produced on a given day is as follows: 40% A, 30% B and 30% C. On the next day, there is a probability of 0.8 that the same product will be produced again, and a probability of 0.1 that the production will switch to each of the other two types. If the factory produces product A today, what is the probability that it will produce product C two days later?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the factory will produce product C two days later, we need to consider the possible scenarios that can lead to this outcome. There are two possible scenarios:\n\n1. The factory produces product A today, product B tomorrow, and product C the day after.\n2. The factory produces product A today, product C tomorrow, and product C the day after.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:\n\nScenario 1:\n- Probability of producing product A today: 1 (given)\n- Probability of switching from product A to product B tomorrow: 0.1\n- Probability of switching from product B to product C the day after: 0.1\n\nThe probability of scenario 1 occurring is the product of these probabilities: 1 * 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01\n\nScenario 2:\n- Probability of producing product A today: 1 (given)\n- Probability of switching from product A to product C tomorrow: 0.1\n- Probability of producing product C again the day after: 0.8\n\nThe probability of scenario 2 occurring is the product of these probabilities: 1 * 0.1 * 0.8 = 0.08\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of both scenarios to find the total probability of producing product C two days later:\n\n0.01 (scenario 1) + 0.08 (scenario 2) = 0.09\n\nSo, the probability that the factory will produce product C two days later is 0.09 or 9%."
