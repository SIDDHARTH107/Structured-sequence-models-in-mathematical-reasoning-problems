    "message_1": "A one-dimensional heat transfer problem in a thin rod is given as follows: \nConsider a copper rod of length 10 cm and radius 1 cm. The rod is initially at a uniform temperature of 150°C. At time t = 0, one end of the rod is immersed in a heat source of temperature 250°C, while the other end is kept in a cold medium of temperature 50°C. Find the temperature distribution of the rod at time t = 0.1 seconds using Fourier Transform. The thermal diffusivity of copper is 1.11 × 10^-4 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the Fourier Transform method. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the position along the rod.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\nLength of the rod (L) = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nRadius of the rod (r) = 1 cm = 0.01 m\nThermal diffusivity (α) = 1.11 × 10^-4 m²/s\nInitial temperature (T₀) = 150°C\nHeat source temperature (T₁) = 250°C\nCold medium temperature (T₂) = 50°C\nTime (t) = 0.1 s\n\nNow, let's apply the boundary conditions:\nAt x = 0, T = T₁ = 250°C\nAt x = L, T = T₂ = 50°C\n\nNext, we will apply the Fourier Transform to the heat equation:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\nFourier Transform(∂T/∂t) = α Fourier Transform(∂²T/∂x²)\n\nLet F(T) be the Fourier Transform of T, then:\n\n∂F(T)/∂t = α k² F(T)\n\nNow, we will solve this ordinary differential equation (ODE) for F(T):\n\nF(T) = C₁ * exp(-α k² t)\n\nNow, we will apply the inverse Fourier Transform to F(T) to get the temperature distribution T(x, t):\n\nT(x, t) = Inverse Fourier Transform(F(T))\n\nT(x, t) = C₁ * ∫ exp(-α k² t) * exp(ikx) dk\n\nNow, we will apply the boundary conditions to T(x, t) and solve for C₁:\n\nAt x = 0, T = T₁ = 250°C\nT(0, t) = C₁ * ∫ exp(-α k² t) * exp(0) dk = 250\n\nAt x = L, T = T₂ = 50°C\nT(L, t) = C₁ * ∫ exp(-α k² t) * exp(ikL) dk = 50\n\nBy solving these two equations, we can find the value of C₁. Then, we can find the temperature distribution T(x, t) at time t = 0.1 s:\n\nT(x, 0.1) = C₁ * ∫ exp(-α k² * 0.1) * exp(ikx) dk\n\nBy evaluating this integral, we can find the temperature distribution of the rod at time t = 0.1 seconds."
