    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the formula $\\varphi(x)$, we need to analyze the implications of the formula.\n\nThe formula states that for all properties $P$ of natural numbers, if for every natural number $x$, $P(x)$ implies $P(x+1)$, then $P(0)$ must hold.\n\nLet's consider two cases:\n\n1. There exists a property $P$ such that for every natural number $x$, $P(x)$ implies $P(x+1)$, but $P(0)$ does not hold. In this case, the formula would be false.\n\n2. For every property $P$, if for every natural number $x$, $P(x)$ implies $P(x+1)$, then $P(0)$ must hold. In this case, the formula would be true.\n\nNow, let's define a property $P$ such that $P(x)$ holds if and only if $x$ is not a natural number. This property satisfies the condition $\\forall x(P(x)\\rightarrow P(x+1))$, since for every natural number $x$, $P(x)$ is false, and a false statement implies any statement. However, $P(0)$ is false, as $0$ is a natural number.\n\nThus, we have found a property $P$ that satisfies the antecedent of the formula but not the consequent. Therefore, the truth value of the formula $\\varphi(x)$ is false."
