If the plane encounters a wind with a velocity of 80 km/h blowing at an angle of 30 degrees to its direction of travel, find the new heading of the plane and the time it will take to reach the destination. Use the law of cosines to solve the triangle.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the plane's velocity vector as P and the wind's velocity vector as W. The resultant velocity vector R is the sum of P and W.\n\nP = 500 km/h\nW = 80 km/h at an angle of 30 degrees to P\n\nFirst, we need to find the components of the wind's velocity vector W. We can use the following equations:\n\nWx = W * cos(30) = 80 * (√3/2) ≈ 69.28 km/h\nWy = W * sin(30) = 80 * (1/2) = 40 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the resultant velocity vector R by adding the components of P and W:\n\nRx = Px + Wx = 500 + 69.28 ≈ 569.28 km/h\nRy = Py + Wy = 0 + 40 = 40 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity vector R using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nR = √(Rx^2 + Ry^2) = √(569.28^2 + 40^2) ≈ 571.62 km/h\n\nNext, we can find the new heading of the plane by calculating the angle between the resultant velocity vector R and the x-axis:\n\ntan(θ) = Ry / Rx = 40 / 569.28\nθ = arctan(40 / 569.28) ≈ 4.03 degrees\n\nSo, the new heading of the plane is 4.03 degrees off its original course.\n\nFinally, we can find the time it will take to reach the destination by dividing the distance by the magnitude of the resultant velocity vector:\n\ntime = distance / R = 1200 km / 571.62 km/h ≈ 2.10 hours\n\nTherefore, the new heading of the plane is 4.03 degrees off its original course, and it will take approximately 2.10 hours to reach the destination."
