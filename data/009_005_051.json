    "message_1": "Consider an RLC circuit with a resistance of 10 ohms, an inductance of 5 henries, and a capacitance of 0.002 farads. The voltage source is given by V(t) = 10sin(100t), where t is the time in seconds. If the initial current flowing through the circuit is 0.5 amps, determine the current at time t = 0.02 seconds using differential equations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the equation for the current I(t) in the RLC circuit. We can start by writing the differential equation for the RLC circuit using Kirchhoff's voltage law:\n\nV(t) = L * (dI(t)/dt) + R * I(t) + (1/C) * ∫I(t) dt\n\nwhere V(t) is the voltage source, L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, and I(t) is the current.\n\nGiven values:\nV(t) = 10sin(100t)\nL = 5 H\nR = 10 Ω\nC = 0.002 F\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the differential equation:\n\n10sin(100t) = 5 * (dI(t)/dt) + 10 * I(t) + (1/0.002) * ∫I(t) dt\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to t:\n\n100cos(100t) = 5 * (d^2I(t)/dt^2) + 10 * (dI(t)/dt) + 0\n\nNow, we have a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation:\n\n5 * (d^2I(t)/dt^2) + 10 * (dI(t)/dt) + 100 * I(t) = 100cos(100t)\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. First, we find the complementary solution by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\n5 * (d^2Ic(t)/dt^2) + 10 * (dIc(t)/dt) + 100 * Ic(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\n5r^2 + 10r + 100 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get two complex roots:\n\nr1, r2 = (-1 ± √(1 - 100)) / 2 = -1 ± 3i\n\nThe complementary solution is given by:\n\nIc(t) = e^(-t) * (Acos(3t) + Bsin(3t))\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution. Since the right-hand side of the non-homogeneous equation is a cosine function, we can assume the particular solution to be:\n\nIp(t) = Ccos(100t) + Dsin(100t)\n\nDifferentiating Ip(t) with respect to t:\n\ndIp(t)/dt = -100Csin(100t) + 100Dcos(100t)\n\nDifferentiating again:\n\nd^2Ip(t)/dt^2 = -10000Ccos(100t) - 10000Dsin(100t)\n\nNow, we can substitute Ip(t), dIp(t)/dt, and d^2Ip(t)/dt^2 into the non-homogeneous equation:\n\n5 * (-10000Ccos(100t) - 10000Dsin(100t)) + 10 * (-100Csin(100t) + 100Dcos(100t)) + 100 * (Ccos(100t) + Dsin(100t)) = 100cos(100t)\n\nComparing the coefficients of cos(100t) and sin(100t), we get two equations:\n\n-50000C + 1000D + 100C = 100\n-50000D - 1000C + 100D = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nC = 1/49\nD = 20/49\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nIp(t) = (1/49)cos(100t) + (20/49)sin(100t)\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\nI(t) = e^(-t) * (Acos(3t) + Bsin(3t)) + (1/49)cos(100t) + (20/49)sin(100t)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions. At t = 0, the initial current is 0.5 A:\n\n0.5 = I(0) = e^(0) * (Acos(0) + Bsin(0)) + (1/49)cos(0) + (20/49)sin(0)\n0.5 = A + 1/49\n\nA = 0.5 - 1/49 = 23/49\n\nNow, we can find the current at t = 0.02 s:\n\nI(0.02) = e^(-0.02) * ((23/49)cos(3*0.02) + Bsin(3*0.02)) + (1/49)cos(100*0.02) + (20/49)sin(100*0.02)\n\nI(0.02) ≈ 0.529 A"
