    "message_1": "A seller wants to sell a house to a buyer. The seller knows the exact value of the house, while the buyer only has an estimate of the house's value. Suppose that the value of the house is either $100,000$ or $200,000$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The buyer's estimate is either $150,000$ or $175,000$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The seller wants to maximize the selling price, while the buyer wants to pay as little as possible. \n\nDesign a mechanism that determines the selling price of the house based on the buyer's estimate. What is the expected selling price of the house under this mechanism?",
    "message_2": "We can design a mechanism where the seller sets two prices, one for each possible value of the house. Let's denote these prices as $P_{100}$ and $P_{200}$, for the $100,000$ and $200,000$ value houses, respectively. The buyer will then choose the price that corresponds to their estimate of the house's value.\n\nTo maximize the selling price, the seller should set $P_{100}$ and $P_{200}$ such that the buyer is indifferent between the two prices when their estimate is $150,000$ or $175,000$. This can be achieved by setting the prices such that the buyer's expected utility is the same for both prices.\n\nLet's denote the buyer's estimate as $E$, and their expected utility as $U$. The buyer's expected utility for choosing $P_{100}$ is:\n\n$U(P_{100}) = \\frac{1}{2}(E - P_{100}) + \\frac{1}{2}(E - 100,000 - P_{100})$\n\nSimilarly, the buyer's expected utility for choosing $P_{200}$ is:\n\n$U(P_{200}) = \\frac{1}{2}(E - 200,000 - P_{200}) + \\frac{1}{2}(E - P_{200})$\n\nTo make the buyer indifferent between the two prices, we set their expected utilities equal:\n\n$U(P_{100}) = U(P_{200})$\n\nFor $E = 150,000$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(150,000 - P_{100}) + \\frac{1}{2}(50,000 - P_{100}) = \\frac{1}{2}(-50,000 - P_{200}) + \\frac{1}{2}(150,000 - P_{200})$\n\nSolving for $P_{100}$ and $P_{200}$, we get:\n\n$P_{100} = 125,000$ and $P_{200} = 175,000$\n\nFor $E = 175,000$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(175,000 - P_{100}) + \\frac{1}{2}(75,000 - P_{100}) = \\frac{1}{2}(-25,000 - P_{200}) + \\frac{1}{2}(175,000 - P_{200})$\n\nSolving for $P_{100}$ and $P_{200}$, we get:\n\n$P_{100} = 137,500$ and $P_{200} = 187,500$\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected selling price of the house under this mechanism. The expected selling price is:\n\n$E[P] = \\frac{1}{2}(P_{100} + P_{200})$\n\nFor $E = 150,000$, the expected selling price is:\n\n$E[P] = \\frac{1}{2}(125,000 + 175,000) = 150,000$\n\nFor $E = 175,000$, the expected selling price is:\n\n$E[P] = \\frac{1}{2}(137,500 + 187,500) = 162,500$\n\nFinally, the overall expected selling price of the house under this mechanism is:\n\n$E[P] = \\frac{1}{2}(150,000) + \\frac{1}{2}(162,500) = 156,250$"
