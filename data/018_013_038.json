This means that a ∈ A and x ∈ (B ∪ C). So, x ∈ B or x ∈ C. Therefore, (a, x) ∈ (A × B) or (a, x) ∈ (A × C), which implies (a, x) ∈ ((A × B) ∪ (A × C)).\n\nNow, let's consider an element (a, x) ∈ ((A × B) ∪ (A × C)). This means that (a, x) ∈ (A × B) or (a, x) ∈ (A × C). So, a ∈ A and (x ∈ B or x ∈ C), which implies x ∈ (B ∪ C). Therefore, (a, x) ∈ (A × (B ∪ C)).\n\nSince both directions are true, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative with respect to union: (A × (B ∪ C)) = ((A × B) ∪ (A × C))."
