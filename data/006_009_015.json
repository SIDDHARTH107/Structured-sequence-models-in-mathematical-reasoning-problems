    "message_1": "In a certain population of 10,000 people, the probability of having a rare medical condition is 0.05. What is the probability that among a randomly selected group of 200 people from that population, exactly 10 of them will have that medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, having the rare medical condition) in n trials (the group of 200 people)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (having the rare medical condition) in a single trial (0.05 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (200 people in this case)\n- k is the number of successes (10 people with the rare medical condition in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) = (200C10) * (0.05^10) * (1-0.05)^(200-10)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 200C10:\n\n200C10 = 200! / (10!(200-10)!)\n= 200! / (10!190!)\n= (200 * 199 * 198 * ... * 191) / (10 * 9 * 8 * ... * 1)\n= 125,656,712,040 / 3,628,800\n= 34,607.109375\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = 34,607.109375 * (0.05^10) * (0.95^190)\n= 34,607.109375 * 9.765625 * 10^(-14) * 0.002034\nâ‰ˆ 0.00684\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 out of the 200 randomly selected people will have the rare medical condition is approximately 0.00684 or 0.684%."
