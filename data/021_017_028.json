    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = -3x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 1 using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population with 20 random individuals (x values) between -5 and 5.\n2. For each individual in the population, calculate its fitness (the value of f(x)).\n3. Perform the DE algorithm's mutation, crossover, and selection steps to create a new population.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a certain number of generations or until convergence.\n5. Select the individual with the lowest fitness value as the solution.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the DE algorithm for the given function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return -3 * x**3 + 5 * x**2 - 4 * x + 1\n\ndef de_algorithm(pop_size, bounds, generations):\n    # Initialize the population\n    population = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], pop_size)\n    \n    # DE parameters\n    F = 0.8\n    CR = 0.9\n\n    for generation in range(generations):\n        new_population = np.copy(population)\n        \n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            # Mutation\n            a, b, c = population[np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)]\n            mutant = a + F * (b - c)\n            \n            # Crossover\n            trial = population[i] if np.random.rand() > CR else mutant\n            \n            # Selection\n            if f(trial) < f(population[i]):\n                new_population[i] = trial\n        \n        population = new_population\n    \n    # Find the individual with the lowest fitness value\n    best_individual = population[np.argmin([f(x) for x in population])]\n    return best_individual, f(best_individual)\n\npop_size = 20\nbounds = (-5, 5)\ngenerations = 1000\n\nx_min, f_min = de_algorithm(pop_size, bounds, generations)\nprint(f\"The minimum value of the function is {f_min:.4f} at x = {x_min:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThe output will show the minimum value of the function and the corresponding x value. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the DE algorithm. You can increase the number of generations or run the algorithm multiple times to improve the accuracy of the result."
