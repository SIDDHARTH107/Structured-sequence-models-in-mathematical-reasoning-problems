    "message_1": "Assuming that the height of a certain population is normally distributed with a mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm, what is the 90% confidence interval for the population's height?",
    "message_2": "To find the 90% confidence interval for the population's height, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a normally distributed population:\n\nCI = mean ± (Z-score * standard deviation)\n\nThe Z-score for a 90% confidence interval can be found using a Z-table or a calculator with a standard normal distribution function. The Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is 1.645 (since 90% of the data lies within 1.645 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nCI = 170 ± (1.645 * 10)\n\nCI = 170 ± 16.45\n\nThe 90% confidence interval for the population's height is approximately 153.55 cm to 186.45 cm."
