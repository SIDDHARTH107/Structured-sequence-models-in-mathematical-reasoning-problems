    "message_2": "We will solve this problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of five-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without any restrictions. There are 5 options for the first digit, 4 options for the second digit, 3 options for the third digit, 2 options for the fourth digit, and 1 option for the last digit. So, there are 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 five-digit numbers without any restrictions.\n\nNow, let's find the number of five-digit numbers with both 2 and 4 in them. We will treat 2 and 4 as a single entity for now. We have 4 options for the first digit (1, 3, 5, and the combined 2 and 4), 3 options for the second digit, 2 options for the third digit, and 1 option for the last digit. So, there are 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways to arrange the digits with 2 and 4 as a single entity.\n\nHowever, 2 and 4 can be arranged in 2! = 2 × 1 = 2 ways within the combined entity. So, there are 24 × 2 = 48 five-digit numbers with both 2 and 4 in them.\n\nNow, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of five-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 with the restriction that 2 and 4 must not appear in the same number.\n\nTotal five-digit numbers = Five-digit numbers without any restrictions - Five-digit numbers with both 2 and 4 in them\n\nTotal five-digit numbers = 120 - 48 = 72\n\nSo, there are 72 five-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 with the restriction that 2 and 4 must not appear in the same number."
