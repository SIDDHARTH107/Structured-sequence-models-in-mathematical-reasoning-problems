    "message_2": "To find the de Rham cohomology class represented by $\\omega$, we first need to check if $\\omega$ is closed, i.e., if $d\\omega = 0$. If $\\omega$ is closed, then we can find its cohomology class in $H^2(X)$.\n\nLet's compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = d(x dx \\wedge dy + y dz \\wedge dx + z dy \\wedge dz).\n$$\n\nUsing the linearity of the exterior derivative, we can compute the derivative of each term separately:\n\n$$\nd(x dx \\wedge dy) = dx \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + x d(dx \\wedge dy) = 0 + x(dy \\wedge dx - dx \\wedge dy) = -x dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dy,\n$$\n\nsince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\nd(y dz \\wedge dx) = -y dz \\wedge dy \\wedge dx,\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nd(z dy \\wedge dz) = z dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy.\n$$\n\nNow, let's sum these terms:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = -x dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dy - y dz \\wedge dy \\wedge dx + z dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy.\n$$\n\nNotice that the first two terms cancel out:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = z dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy.\n$$\n\nSince $X$ is a compact, orientable surface of genus 2, it has no non-vanishing 2-forms. Therefore, $z dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$ must be zero, which implies that $d\\omega = 0$. Thus, $\\omega$ is a closed 2-form.\n\nNow, we need to check if $\\omega$ is exact, i.e., if there exists a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that $d\\alpha = \\omega$. If $\\omega$ is exact, then its cohomology class is trivial, i.e., $[\\omega] = 0$ in $H^2(X)$.\n\nSuppose there exists a 1-form $\\alpha = f dx + g dy + h dz$ such that $d\\alpha = \\omega$. Then,\n\n$$\nd\\alpha = df \\wedge dx + dg \\wedge dy + dh \\wedge dz = \\omega.\n$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the basis elements, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\ndf = x \\\\\ndg = y \\\\\ndh = z\n\\end{cases}.\n$$\n\nHowever, since $X$ is a compact, orientable surface of genus 2, it is not possible to find globally defined functions $f, g, h$ that satisfy these equations. Therefore, $\\omega$ is not exact.\n\nSince $\\omega$ is closed but not exact, it represents a non-trivial cohomology class in $H^2(X)$. Thus, the de Rham cohomology class represented by $\\omega$ is $[\\omega] \\in H^2(X)$."
