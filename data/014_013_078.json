    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using a 2x2 Hill cipher matrix with the key matrix [3 1; 4 2], we first need to convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). \n\nH -> 7\nE -> 4\nL -> 11\nL -> 11\nO -> 14\n\nSince the Hill cipher matrix is 2x2, we need to break the message into pairs of letters. If the message has an odd number of letters, we can add an extra letter (usually 'X' or 'Z') to make it even. In this case, the message is already even, so we can proceed with the pairs:\n\n(7, 4), (11, 11), (14, -)\n\nNow, we multiply each pair by the key matrix:\n\n[3 1] [7]   [22]   [22%26]   [22]   W\n[4 2] [4] = [20] = [20%26] = [20]   U\n\n[3 1] [11]   [33]   [33%26]   [7]   H\n[4 2] [11] = [48] = [48%26] = [22]   W\n\n[3 1] [14]   [42]   [42%26]   [16]   Q\n[4 2] [14] = [64] = [64%26] = [12]   M\n\nThe encrypted message is \"WUHWQM\"."
