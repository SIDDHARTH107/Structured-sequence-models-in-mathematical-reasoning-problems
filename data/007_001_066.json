    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we can use the equation:\n\n5x + 4 = prime number\n\nWe can start by testing the smallest possible value for x:\n\n1. When x = 0, 5(0) + 4 = 4 (not a prime number)\n2. When x = 1, 5(1) + 4 = 9 (not a prime number)\n3. When x = 2, 5(2) + 4 = 14 (not a prime number)\n4. When x = 3, 5(3) + 4 = 19 (a prime number)\n\nSo, the smallest prime number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5 is 19."
