Prove that for every pair of distinct points y1, y2 in Y, there exist disjoint open sets U1, U2 in X such that y1 in U1, y2 in U2, and U1 and U2 have empty intersection.",
    "message_2": "Given that X is a topological space such that every pair of distinct points in X can be separated by disjoint open sets, we know that for any two distinct points x1, x2 in X, there exist disjoint open sets V1, V2 in X such that x1 in V1 and x2 in V2.\n\nNow, let y1 and y2 be distinct points in Y, where Y is a closed subset of X with the subspace topology. Since y1 and y2 are distinct points in X as well, there exist disjoint open sets V1, V2 in X such that y1 in V1 and y2 in V2.\n\nSince Y is a closed subset of X, its complement, X \\ Y, is an open set in X. Now, consider the open sets U1 = V1 ∩ (X \\ Y)^c and U2 = V2 ∩ (X \\ Y)^c. Note that (X \\ Y)^c is just Y, as it is the complement of the complement of Y.\n\nU1 and U2 are open sets in X, as they are the intersection of open sets in X. Moreover, y1 is in U1 and y2 is in U2, as y1 is in V1 and Y, and y2 is in V2 and Y.\n\nFinally, we need to show that U1 and U2 have an empty intersection. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a point z in U1 ∩ U2. Then z is in both V1 and V2, which contradicts the fact that V1 and V2 are disjoint open sets in X. Thus, U1 and U2 must have an empty intersection.\n\nIn conclusion, for every pair of distinct points y1, y2 in Y, there exist disjoint open sets U1, U2 in X such that y1 in U1, y2 in U2, and U1 and U2 have an empty intersection."
