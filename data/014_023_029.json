    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using a Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails, we need to arrange the cipher text in a zigzag pattern and then read the plaintext horizontally.\n\n1. Divide the cipher text into groups based on the number of rails:\n\n   - Rail 1: MEM\n   - Rail 2: TAAESE\n   - Rail 3: EFTRCL\n\n2. Arrange the groups in a zigzag pattern:\n\n   M       E       M\n    T   A   A   E   S   E\n     E       F       T       R       C       L\n\n3. Read the plaintext horizontally:\n\n   \"MEET ME AFTER CLASS\"\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"MEET ME AFTER CLASS\"."
