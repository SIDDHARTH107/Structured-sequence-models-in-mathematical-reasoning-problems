    "message_2": "To find the invertible matrix P and the diagonal matrix D, we need to diagonalize the matrix A. We'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues of A.\n2. Find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n3. Form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns.\n4. Compute the inverse of P.\n5. Calculate P^-1AP to obtain the diagonal matrix D.\n\nStep 1: Find the eigenvalues of A.\n\nThe characteristic equation of A is given by:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nFor A, the characteristic equation is:\n\n(3 - λ)(6 - λ) - (2 * 2) = 0\nλ^2 - 9λ + 14 = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 7.\n\nStep 2: Find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n\n(A - 2I)v1 = 0\n\n[[1, 2], [2, 4]]v1 = 0\n\nThe eigenvector v1 can be:\n\nv1 = [2, -1]\n\nFor λ2 = 7:\n\n(A - 7I)v2 = 0\n\n[[-4, 2], [2, -1]]v2 = 0\n\nThe eigenvector v2 can be:\n\nv2 = [1, 2]\n\nStep 3: Form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns.\n\nP = [[2, 1], [-1, 2]]\n\nStep 4: Compute the inverse of P.\n\nTo find the inverse of P, we can use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\nP^-1 = (1/det(P)) * adj(P)\n\nwhere det(P) is the determinant of P and adj(P) is the adjugate of P.\n\ndet(P) = (2 * 2) - (-1 * 1) = 5\n\nadj(P) = [[2, -1], [1, 2]]\n\nP^-1 = (1/5) * [[2, -1], [1, 2]]\nP^-1 = [[2/5, -1/5], [1/5, 2/5]]\n\nStep 5: Calculate P^-1AP to obtain the diagonal matrix D.\n\nD = P^-1AP\nD = [[2/5, -1/5], [1/5, 2/5]] * [[3, 2], [2, 6]] * [[2, 1], [-1, 2]]\n\nFirst, calculate the product of the first two matrices:\n\nM1 = [[2/5, -1/5], [1/5, 2/5]] * [[3, 2], [2, 6]]\nM1 = [[(2/5)*3 + (-1/5)*2, (2/5)*2 + (-1/5)*6], [(1/5)*3 + (2/5)*2, (1/5)*2 + (2/5)*6]]\nM1 = [[8/5, -2/5], [7/5, 14/5]]\n\nNow, calculate the product of M1 and P:\n\nD = [[8/5, -2/5], [7/5, 14/5]] * [[2, 1], [-1, 2]]\nD = [[(8/5)*2 + (-2/5)*(-1), (8/5)*1 + (-2/5)*2], [(7/5)*2 + (14/5)*(-1), (7/5)*1 + (14/5)*2]]\nD = [[2, 0], [0, 7]]\n\nSo, the invertible matrix P is:\n\nP = [[2, 1], [-1, 2]]\n\nand the diagonal matrix D is:\n\nD = [[2, 0], [0, 7]]"
