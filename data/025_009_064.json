    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the space of degree $d$ line bundles on $M_{1,1}$, we first need to understand the structure of $M_{1,1}$. The moduli space $M_{1,1}$ parametrizes isomorphism classes of elliptic curves with a marked point. It is well-known that $M_{1,1}$ is isomorphic to the quotient space $\\mathcal{H}/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, where $\\mathcal{H}$ is the upper half-plane and $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is the group of $2\\times 2$ matrices with integer entries and determinant 1.\n\nNow, let $\\mathcal{L}$ be a line bundle of degree $d$ on $M_{1,1}$. The dimension of the space of sections of $\\mathcal{L}$, denoted by $H^0(M_{1,1},\\mathcal{L})$, is given by the Riemann-Roch theorem. For a line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ on a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g$, the Riemann-Roch theorem states that\n$$\n\\dim H^0(X,\\mathcal{L}) - \\dim H^0(X,\\mathcal{K}_X\\otimes\\mathcal{L}^{-1}) = \\deg(\\mathcal{L}) + 1 - g,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{K}_X$ is the canonical bundle on $X$.\n\nIn our case, $X = M_{1,1}$, which has genus $g = 0$. Therefore, the Riemann-Roch theorem simplifies to\n$$\n\\dim H^0(M_{1,1},\\mathcal{L}) = \\deg(\\mathcal{L}) + 1.\n$$\nSince $\\deg(\\mathcal{L}) = d$, we have\n$$\n\\dim H^0(M_{1,1},\\mathcal{L}) = d + 1.\n$$\nThus, the dimension of the space of degree $d$ line bundles on $M_{1,1}$ is $d + 1$."
