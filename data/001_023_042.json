    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x in the equation:\n\nsin(x) + 0.5 = 1\n\nFirst, subtract 0.5 from both sides of the equation:\n\nsin(x) = 1 - 0.5\nsin(x) = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle x whose sine is 0.5. Since we are looking for angles between 0 and 360 degrees, we can use the inverse sine function (also known as arcsin or sin^(-1)):\n\nx = arcsin(0.5)\n\nx ≈ 30 degrees\n\nHowever, since the sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants, there is another angle in the second quadrant that also has a sine of 0.5:\n\nx = 180 - 30\nx = 150 degrees\n\nSo, there are two solutions for x in the given range:\n\nx ≈ 30 degrees and x ≈ 150 degrees"
