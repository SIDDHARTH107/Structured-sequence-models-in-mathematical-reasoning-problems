We will move every third letter forward by four positions.\n\nM (1) A (2) T (3) H (4) E (5) M (6) A (7) T (8) I (9) C (10) S (11)\n\nNow, we will move the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and so on letters forward by four positions:\n\nM A (T+4) H E (M+4) A T (I+4) C S\n\nM A X H E Q A T M C S\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext is \"MAXHEQATMCS\"."
