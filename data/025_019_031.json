    "message_2": "The Fano variety in this case is the intersection of two quadrics in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4$. Let's denote the two quadrics as $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. The degree of a variety is the number of intersection points with a generic linear subspace of complementary dimension.\n\nThe Fano variety has codimension 2, so its dimension is 2 (since $\\mathbb{P}^4$ has dimension 4). Therefore, we need to find the number of intersection points with a generic linear subspace of dimension 2, which is a plane in $\\mathbb{P}^4$.\n\nLet's denote this plane as $H$. The intersection of $H$ with each quadric is a conic (a degree 2 curve). The intersection of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ in $H$ is the intersection of these two conics. Since each conic is a degree 2 curve, their intersection consists of 4 points (counted with multiplicity) in the generic case.\n\nThus, the degree of the Fano variety given by the intersection of two quadrics in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is 4."
