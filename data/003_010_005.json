    "message_1": "A building is 50 meters tall. From a distance of 100 meters, an observer sees the top of the building at an angle of 30 degrees above horizontal. What is the height of the observer's eye level above the ground?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the height of the observer's eye level above the ground as h. We have a right triangle with the angle of 30 degrees, the opposite side being the difference in height between the building and the observer (50 - h), and the adjacent side being the distance from the observer to the building, which is 100 meters.\n\nUsing the tangent function, we have:\n\ntan(30) = (50 - h) / 100\n\nThe tangent of 30 degrees is equal to 1/sqrt(3) or sqrt(3)/3. So,\n\nsqrt(3)/3 = (50 - h) / 100\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\n100 * (sqrt(3)/3) = 50 - h\n\n100 * (sqrt(3)/3) + h = 50\n\nh = 50 - 100 * (sqrt(3)/3)\n\nh ≈ 50 - 57.74\n\nh ≈ -7.74\n\nSince the height of the observer's eye level above the ground cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement. It is not possible for the observer to see the top of the building at an angle of 30 degrees above horizontal from a distance of 100 meters if the building is 50 meters tall."
