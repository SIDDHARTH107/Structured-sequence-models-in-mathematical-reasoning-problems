    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 4 is isomorphic to either C4 (cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (Klein-4 group), we will analyze the possible structures of G and show that it must have the same group table as either C4 or V4.\n\nLet G be a group of order 4, and let g be an element of G. There are three possibilities for the order of g:\n\n1. The order of g is 1. In this case, g is the identity element of G, denoted by e.\n\n2. The order of g is 2. This means that g^2 = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\n3. The order of g is 4. This means that g^4 = e, and none of the powers g, g^2, g^3 are equal to e.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nIn this case, let g be an element of order 4. Then, G = {e, g, g^2, g^3}. The group table of G is:\n\n```\n   e  g  g^2  g^3\ne  e  g  g^2  g^3\ng  g g^2  g^3   e\ng^2 g^2 g^3   e   g\ng^3 g^3  e   g  g^2\n```\n\nThis group table is the same as the group table of C4, so G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let G = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c are distinct non-identity elements. Since their orders are 2, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\n\nNow, consider the product ab. It cannot be equal to e, as that would imply a = b^(-1) = b, which contradicts the distinctness of a and b. It cannot be equal to a or b, as that would imply either b or a is the identity, which is not true. Therefore, ab = c.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that bc = a and ca = b. The group table of G is:\n\n```\n   e  a  b  c\ne  e  a  b  c\na  a  e  c  b\nb  b  c  e  a\nc  c  b  a  e\n```\n\nThis group table is the same as the group table of V4, so G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, any group G of order 4 must be isomorphic to either C4 or V4, as it has the same group table as either C4 or V4."
