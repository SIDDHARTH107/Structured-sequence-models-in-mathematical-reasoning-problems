    "message_2": "To solve the given Schrödinger equation, let's first rewrite it in a more familiar form:\n\ni(dψ/dx) + 2xψ = λψ\n\nDivide both sides by i:\n\n(dψ/dx) = i(λ - 2x)ψ\n\nNow, let's try to solve this first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\nI(x) = exp(∫i(λ - 2x)dx)\n\nI(x) = exp(i(λx - x^2))\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the ODE by the integrating factor:\n\nI(x)(dψ/dx) = i(λ - 2x)I(x)ψ\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of I(x) and ψ:\n\nd/dx(I(x)ψ) = i(λ - 2x)I(x)ψ\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫d/dx(I(x)ψ)dx = ∫i(λ - 2x)I(x)ψ dx\n\nI(x)ψ = ∫i(λ - 2x)I(x)ψ dx + C\n\nNow, we apply the boundary condition ψ(0) = 0:\n\nI(0)ψ(0) = C\n\nSince I(0) = exp(0) = 1, we have C = 0. So,\n\nI(x)ψ = ∫i(λ - 2x)I(x)ψ dx\n\nNow, apply the second boundary condition ψ(1) = 0:\n\nI(1)ψ(1) = ∫[0,1] i(λ - 2x)I(x)ψ dx\n\nSince ψ(1) = 0, we have:\n\n0 = ∫[0,1] i(λ - 2x)I(x)ψ dx\n\nFor this integral to be zero, the integrand must be zero for some non-trivial ψ. This means that there must be some non-zero ψ(x) that satisfies:\n\ni(λ - 2x)I(x)ψ = 0\n\nThis can only happen if λ is an eigenvalue of the problem. The eigenvalues are determined by the boundary conditions and the potential function (in this case, 2x). In general, finding the eigenvalues for a given potential is a difficult task, and there is no general formula for them. However, for this specific problem, we can make an educated guess.\n\nLet's try λ = 2:\n\ni(2 - 2x)I(x)ψ = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied by ψ(x) = A sin(πx), where A is a constant. This function satisfies the boundary conditions ψ(0) = ψ(1) = 0. Therefore, we have found a non-trivial solution for λ = 2.\n\nSo, the value of λ for which a non-trivial solution exists is λ = 2."
