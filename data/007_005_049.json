    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 18, 24, and 36, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n18 = 2 × 3^2\n24 = 2^3 × 3\n36 = 2^2 × 3^2\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n2^3 (from 24) and 3^2 (from 18 or 36)\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^3 × 3^2 = 8 × 9 = 72\n\nSo, the LCM of 18, 24, and 36 is 72."
