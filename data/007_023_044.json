    "message_2": "To compute the SHA-256 hash value of the message \"Hello, World!\", you can use a programming language or an online tool. Here's the hash value:\n\n`315f5bdb76d078c43b8ac0064e4a0164612b1fce77c869345bfc94c75894edd3`\n\nKeep in mind that as a mathematician, I can explain the algorithm and the process of calculating the hash, but the actual calculation is typically done using a computer program or tool."
