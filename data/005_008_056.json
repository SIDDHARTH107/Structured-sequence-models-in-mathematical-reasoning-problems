The sales data is as follows: \n\nDay 1: 100 units sold \n\nDay 2: 200 units sold \n\nDay 3: 150 units sold \n\nDay 4: 225 units sold \n\nDay 5: 300 units sold \n\n... \n\nDay 99: 400 units sold \n\nDay 100: 450 units sold \n\nUsing time series analysis techniques, what is the forecasted number of units to be sold on Day 101 if the company experiences a 5% increase in sales over the last 30 days?",
    "message_2": "To forecast the number of units to be sold on Day 101, we can use a simple moving average (SMA) method based on the last 30 days of sales data. First, we need to calculate the average sales for the last 30 days (from Day 71 to Day 100). However, we don't have the complete sales data for these days, so we will make an assumption that the sales data provided (Day 1 to Day 5, Day 99, and Day 100) is representative of the overall trend.\n\n1. Calculate the average sales for the given data points:\n\n(100 + 200 + 150 + 225 + 300 + 400 + 450) / 7 = 257.14 units (approximately)\n\n2. Assume this average is representative of the last 30 days and apply the 5% increase:\n\n257.14 * 1.05 = 270 units (approximately)\n\nBased on the simple moving average method and the given data, the forecasted number of units to be sold on Day 101 is approximately 270 units, considering a 5% increase in sales over the last 30 days. However, this forecast may not be very accurate due to the limited sales data provided."
