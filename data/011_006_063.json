    "message_1": "Suppose you have 4 different colors of balls (blue, green, red, and yellow) and 3 boxes of different sizes (small, medium, and large). How many ways are there to distribute the balls among the boxes such that all boxes have at least one ball?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. First, let's find the total number of ways to distribute the balls without any restrictions. Then, we'll subtract the cases where one or more boxes are empty.\n\n1. Total number of ways to distribute the balls without any restrictions:\nThere are 3 boxes, and each ball can go into any of the 3 boxes. So, for each of the 4 balls, there are 3 choices. Therefore, there are 3^4 = 81 ways to distribute the balls without any restrictions.\n\n2. Number of ways with one or more empty boxes:\na) One empty box: There are 3 ways to choose which box will be empty. Then, there are 2 choices for each of the 4 balls (since they can only go into the remaining 2 boxes). So, there are 3 * 2^4 = 3 * 16 = 48 ways to have one empty box.\nb) Two empty boxes: There are 3 ways to choose which box will have all the balls. Then, there is only 1 choice for each of the 4 balls (since they all must go into the chosen box). So, there are 3 * 1^4 = 3 ways to have two empty boxes.\n\n3. Number of ways with all boxes having at least one ball:\nUsing the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we subtract the cases with one or more empty boxes from the total number of ways without any restrictions: 81 - 48 - 3 = 30.\n\nSo, there are 30 ways to distribute the balls among the boxes such that all boxes have at least one ball."
