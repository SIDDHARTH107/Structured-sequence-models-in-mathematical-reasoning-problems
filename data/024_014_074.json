    "message_2": "To compute the flow generated by the vector field V at time t = π/2, starting from the point (1,1,-1), we need to solve the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given by:\n\ndx/dt = x^2\ndy/dt = e^(yz)\ndz/dt = -z^3\n\nwith the initial conditions x(0) = 1, y(0) = 1, and z(0) = -1.\n\nFirst, we solve the ODEs separately:\n\n1) dx/dt = x^2\nSeparate variables and integrate:\n∫(1/x^2) dx = ∫ dt\n-1/x = t + C1\nx = -1/(t + C1)\n\nSince x(0) = 1, we have:\n1 = -1/C1\nC1 = -1\nSo, x(t) = -1/(t - 1)\n\n2) dy/dt = e^(yz)\nSeparate variables and integrate:\n∫(1/y) dy = ∫ e^(yz) dt\nln|y| = ∫ e^(yz) dt + C2\n\nTo find the integral of e^(yz) with respect to t, we use integration by parts:\nLet u = t, dv = e^(yz) dt\ndu = dt, v = (1/z)e^(yz)\n\n∫ e^(yz) dt = t(1/z)e^(yz) - ∫(1/z)e^(yz) dt\n(1/z)∫ e^(yz) dt = t(1/z)e^(yz) - (1/z^2)e^(yz) + C3\n∫ e^(yz) dt = zt e^(yz) - e^(yz)/z + C3z\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the equation for y:\nln|y| = zt e^(yz) - e^(yz)/z + C3z + C2\n\nSince y(0) = 1, we have:\n0 = -1/z + C3z + C2\nC2 = 1/z - C3z\n\nSo, ln|y| = zt e^(yz) - e^(yz)/z + C3z + 1/z - C3z\ny(t) = e^(zt e^(yz) - e^(yz)/z + 1/z)\n\n3) dz/dt = -z^3\nSeparate variables and integrate:\n∫(-1/z^3) dz = ∫ dt\n1/z^2 = -2t + C4\n\nSince z(0) = -1, we have:\n1 = -2(0) + C4\nC4 = 1\nSo, z(t) = 1/sqrt(-2t + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the flow at time t = π/2:\nx(π/2) = -1/(π/2 - 1)\ny(π/2) = e^((π/2) e^(y(π/2)z(π/2)) - e^(y(π/2)z(π/2))/z(π/2) + 1/z(π/2))\nz(π/2) = 1/sqrt(-2(π/2) + 1)\n\nThe flow generated by V at time t = π/2, starting from the point (1,1,-1), is given by the point (x(π/2), y(π/2), z(π/2)). However, note that the expression for y(π/2) is implicit and may not have a closed-form solution."
