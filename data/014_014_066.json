    "message_1": "A Playfair cipher encrypts pairs of letters by rearranging them on a 5x5 grid, and then using the ordered pairs of grid coordinates to form the ciphertext. Suppose we want to encrypt the plaintext \"MATHSTAR\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPT\". Find the ciphertext.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to create the 5x5 grid using the key \"CRYPT\". We remove duplicate letters from the key and fill in the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is usually combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe grid looks like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nA B D E F\nG H I K L\nM N O Q S\nU V W X Z\n\nNow, we need to split the plaintext \"MATHSTAR\" into pairs. If a pair has the same letter, we insert an 'X' between them. In this case, we don't need to do that. So, the pairs are: MA TH ST AR\n\nNow, we encrypt each pair using the grid:\n\n1. MA -> CR\n   M is at (3, 0) and A is at (1, 0), so we take the letters at (3, 1) and (1, 1), which are C and R.\n\n2. TH -> YP\n   T is at (0, 4) and H is at (2, 1), so we take the letters at (0, 1) and (2, 4), which are Y and P.\n\n3. ST -> KQ\n   S is at (3, 4) and T is at (0, 4), so we take the letters at (3, 0) and (0, 0), which are K and Q.\n\n4. AR -> YT\n   A is at (1, 0) and R is at (0, 1), so we take the letters at (1, 1) and (0, 4), which are Y and T.\n\nSo, the ciphertext is \"CRYPYTKQYT\"."
