    "message_1": "Suppose you are managing a packaging company that produces two products: Product A and Product B. The production process requires two machines: Machine X and Machine Y. The production times (in minutes) for each product and machine are given in the matrix below:\n\n|   Machine  | Product A | Product B |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Machine X  |    2      |     1     |\n| Machine Y  |    1      |     2     |\n\nIf the company has only 60 minutes available for machine X and 50 minutes available for machine Y, what is the maximum number of units of each product that can be produced per day? The profit per unit for Product A is $10 and for Product B is $12. What is the optimal production mix to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the available time on each machine can be written as:\n\n2x + y ≤ 60 (Machine X)\nx + 2y ≤ 50 (Machine Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 12y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 60\ny ≤ -2x + 60\n\nx + 2y ≤ 50\ny ≤ -0.5x + 25\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 25), (20, 20), and (30, 0).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\nP(0, 25) = 10(0) + 12(25) = $300\nP(20, 20) = 10(20) + 12(20) = $440\nP(30, 0) = 10(30) + 12(0) = $300\n\nThe maximum profit of $440 is achieved when producing 20 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B. This is the optimal production mix to maximize profit."
