    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1 meter is heated from one end at a constant rate of 1000 Watts/meter. The other end is kept at a constant temperature of 0°C. The thermal conductivity of the rod is 1000 W/mK and the cross-sectional area is 0.01 m^2. Find the temperature distribution along the rod at a distance of 0.2 meters from the heated end using Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the rod, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the distance along the rod. The thermal diffusivity is given by:\n\nα = k/(ρc)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat capacity. For this problem, we are given k = 1000 W/mK, and we need to find the steady-state temperature distribution, which means ∂T/∂t = 0. Therefore, we have:\n\n0 = ∂²T/∂x²\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of the second derivative of T with respect to x is:\n\nF(∂²T/∂x²) = -k²F(T)\n\nwhere F(T) is the Fourier transform of T, and k is the wave number. Since the left side of the equation is 0, we have:\n\n-k²F(T) = 0\n\nThis implies that F(T) = 0 for all k ≠ 0. Therefore, the temperature distribution T(x) is a linear function of x:\n\nT(x) = Ax + B\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions: T(0) = 0 and q(1) = 1000 W/m, where q(x) is the heat flux at position x. The heat flux is given by:\n\nq(x) = -k ∂T/∂x\n\nAt x = 0, we have T(0) = 0, which implies B = 0. So, T(x) = Ax.\n\nAt x = 1, we have q(1) = 1000 W/m. Therefore:\n\n1000 W/m = -k ∂T/∂x = -kA\n\nWe are given k = 1000 W/mK, so:\n\n1000 W/m = -1000 W/mK * A\n\nThis gives A = -1 K/m. Thus, the temperature distribution along the rod is:\n\nT(x) = -x\n\nNow, we can find the temperature at a distance of 0.2 meters from the heated end:\n\nT(0.2) = -0.2\n\nThe temperature at a distance of 0.2 meters from the heated end is -0.2°C."
