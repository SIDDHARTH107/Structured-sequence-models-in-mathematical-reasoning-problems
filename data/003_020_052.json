    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The pilot needs to make a descent to land at an airport that is located 5 miles away horizontally. What angle of descent must the pilot take to land the plane? (Assume a flat surface and no wind resistance.)",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of descent, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. First, we need to convert the horizontal distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so the horizontal distance is 5 * 5280 = 26,400 feet.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(angle) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(angle) = (10,000 feet) / (26,400 feet)\n\nTo find the angle, we take the inverse tangent (arctan) of both sides:\n\nangle = arctan(10,000 / 26,400)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nangle â‰ˆ 20.3 degrees\n\nSo, the pilot must take an angle of descent of approximately 20.3 degrees to land the plane."
