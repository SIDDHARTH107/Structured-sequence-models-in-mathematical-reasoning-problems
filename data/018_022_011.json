    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, then find the symmetric difference of A and B. Next, find the Cartesian product of B and A, then find the symmetric difference of B and A. Show that the two symmetric differences are not equal, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, A x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. A Δ B = {1, 4}.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A. B x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A. B Δ A = {1, 4}.\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric differences are not equal with respect to the Cartesian product. To do this, we will find the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences and compare them.\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}.\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}.\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = (B Δ A) x (A Δ B), which means that the symmetric differences are equal with respect to the Cartesian product. This contradicts the statement that we need to prove. Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
