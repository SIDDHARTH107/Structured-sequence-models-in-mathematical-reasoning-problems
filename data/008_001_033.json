    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its reduced row echelon form.\n3. Read the solution from the reduced row echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 2  3  1 | 7 |\n| 1  2  4 | 12|\n| 3  1  2 | 8 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its reduced row echelon form.\n\nFirst, we will swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1  2  4 | 12|\n| 2  3  1 | 7 |\n| 3  1  2 | 8 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column below the 1:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1:\n| 1  2  4 | 12|\n| 0  -1 -7 | -17|\n| 3  1  2 | 8 |\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1:\n| 1  2  4 | 12|\n| 0  -1 -7 | -17|\n| 0  -5 -10| -28|\n\nNow, we will multiply Row 2 by -1 to make the pivot element in the second row positive:\n\n| 1  2  4 | 12|\n| 0  1  7 | 17|\n| 0  -5 -10| -28|\n\nNext, we will eliminate the -5 in the second column below the 1:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 + 5 * Row 2:\n| 1  2  4 | 12|\n| 0  1  7 | 17|\n| 0  0  25| 57|\n\nNow, we will divide Row 3 by 25 to make the pivot element in the third row equal to 1:\n\n| 1  2  4 | 12|\n| 0  1  7 | 17|\n| 0  0  1 | 57/25|\n\nFinally, we will eliminate the 4 and 7 in the third column above the 1:\n\nRow 1 = Row 1 - 4 * Row 3:\n| 1  2  0 | -44/25|\n| 0  1  7 | 17|\n| 0  0  1 | 57/25|\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 7 * Row 3:\n| 1  2  0 | -44/25|\n| 0  1  0 | -24/25|\n| 0  0  1 | 57/25|\n\nStep 3: Read the solution from the reduced row echelon form.\n\nThe reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix corresponds to the following system of equations:\n\nx + 2y = -44/25\ny = -24/25\nz = 57/25\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -44/25\ny = -24/25\nz = 57/25"
