    "message_1": "Sorry, I cannot generate a precise numerical problem for modal logic, as it deals with concepts of possibility and necessity that are not well-suited for numerical problems. Modal logic questions are typically based on formulating arguments and determining their validity using modal operators such as \"necessarily\" and \"possibly\". Can I assist you with any other math topic?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Please provide me with a math topic or problem you would like assistance with, and I'll be happy to help."
