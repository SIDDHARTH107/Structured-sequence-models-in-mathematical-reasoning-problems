    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x over the interval [-1, 1], we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx) + b_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, all the a_n coefficients will be zero. Now, we need to find the b_n coefficients. To do this, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)] dx, where L is half the period of the function.\n\nIn our case, L = 1, so the formula becomes:\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫[x * sin(nπx)] dx, with the integral taken over the interval [-1, 1].\n\nNow, we integrate by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nπx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = 2 * [(-x/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) + (1/(nπ)) * ∫cos(nπx) dx] evaluated from -1 to 1\n\nb_n = 2 * [(-1/(nπ)) * cos(nπ) - (-1/(nπ)) * cos(-nπ) + (1/(n²π²)) * sin(nπ) - (1/(n²π²)) * sin(-nπ)]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\nb_n = 2 * [(-1/(nπ)) * (-1)^n - (-1/(nπ)) * (-1)^n]\nb_n = 4/(nπ) * (-1)^n for n ≠ 0\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(4/(nπ)) * (-1)^n * sin(nπx)]\n\nTo compute f(0.5), we plug x = 0.5 into the Fourier series:\n\nf(0.5) = Σ [(4/(nπ)) * (-1)^n * sin(nπ(0.5))]\n\nNote that the series converges, but to get an approximation, we can sum the first few terms:\n\nf(0.5) ≈ (4/(π)) * (-1) * sin(π/2) + (4/(3π)) * sin(3π/2) + (4/(5π)) * (-1) * sin(5π/2) + ...\n\nf(0.5) ≈ -4/π + 4/(3π) - 4/(5π) + ...\n\nThe more terms you include, the better the approximation. However, it's important to note that f(0.5) = 0.5 by definition, so the Fourier series converges to the correct value as you include more terms."
