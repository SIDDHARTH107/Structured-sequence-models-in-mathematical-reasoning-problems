    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 identical candies and you want to distribute them among 4 kids such that each kid must get at least one candy. In how many ways can you distribute the candies among the kids?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. Since each kid must get at least one candy, we can first give one candy to each kid. Now, we have 6 candies left to distribute among the 4 kids without any restrictions.\n\nWe can represent the candies as stars (*) and use bars (|) to separate the candies for each kid. For example, if we have 6 candies and 4 kids, one possible distribution could be:\n\n**|*|*|***\n\nThis would mean that the first kid gets 2 candies, the second kid gets 1 candy, the third kid gets 1 candy, and the fourth kid gets 3 candies.\n\nSince we have 6 candies left and 3 bars to separate them, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these 6 stars and 3 bars. There are a total of 9 positions (6 stars + 3 bars), and we need to choose 3 positions for the bars.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 9 and k = 3:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!)\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!6!)\nC(9, 3) = 362880 / (6 * 720)\nC(9, 3) = 362880 / 4320\nC(9, 3) = 84\n\nSo there are 84 ways to distribute the remaining 6 candies among the 4 kids, given that each kid already has at least one candy."
