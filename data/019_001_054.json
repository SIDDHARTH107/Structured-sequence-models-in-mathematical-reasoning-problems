    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given compound statement (p ∧ q) → ¬q.\n\nWe know that the compound statement is true. In order for an implication (A → B) to be true, either A is false or B is true (or both). So, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: (p ∧ q) is false.\nThis means that either p is false, q is false, or both are false.\n\nCase 2: ¬q is true.\nThis means that q is false (since ¬q is the negation of q).\n\nIn both cases, we find that q must be false. Now, let's consider the value of p. If q is false, then the compound statement (p ∧ q) is also false, regardless of the truth value of p. Since the compound statement is true, this means that p can be either true or false.\n\nIn conclusion, the truth value of p is undetermined (it can be either true or false), and the truth value of q is false."
