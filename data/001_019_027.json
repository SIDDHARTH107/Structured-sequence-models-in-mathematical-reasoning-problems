    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x - 2| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 2 = 7\nCase 2: 3x - 2 = -7\n\nNow, we will solve each case separately.\n\nCase 1: 3x - 2 = 7\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation:\n3x = 9\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 2 = -7\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation:\n3x = -5\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\nx = -5/3\n\nSo, the solutions to the absolute value equation |3x - 2| = 7 are x = 3 and x = -5/3."
