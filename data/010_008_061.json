    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFrom the given simplicial complex, we can count:\n\nV (vertices) = 5 (labeled A, B, C, D, and E)\nE (edges) = 7 (AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, and CE)\nF (faces) = 3 (ABC, ADE, and BCD)\n\nNow, we can calculate the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ = V - E + F = 5 - 7 + 3 = 1\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of this simplicial complex is 1."
