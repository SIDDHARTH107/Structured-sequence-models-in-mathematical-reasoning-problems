    "message_2": "To determine the isometry group of the manifold M with the given metric tensor g, we need to find all transformations that preserve the distances between points on the manifold. In other words, we need to find all transformations that leave the metric tensor g invariant.\n\nLet's consider a general coordinate transformation (x, y, z) → (x', y', z') with x' = x'(x, y, z), y' = y'(x, y, z), and z' = z'(x, y, z). The metric tensor in the new coordinates (x', y', z') is given by:\n\ng' = (∂x'/∂x)^2 dx'^2 + (∂y'/∂x)^2 dx'^2 + (∂z'/∂x)^2 dx'^2 + 4(∂x'/∂y)^2 dy'^2 + 4(∂y'/∂y)^2 dy'^2 + 4(∂z'/∂y)^2 dy'^2 + 4(∂x'/∂z)^2 dz'^2 + 4(∂y'/∂z)^2 dz'^2 + 4(∂z'/∂z)^2 dz'^2.\n\nFor the transformation to be an isometry, we require g' = g, which means:\n\n(∂x'/∂x)^2 + 4(∂x'/∂y)^2 + 4(∂x'/∂z)^2 = 1,\n(∂y'/∂x)^2 + 4(∂y'/∂y)^2 + 4(∂y'/∂z)^2 = 4,\n(∂z'/∂x)^2 + 4(∂z'/∂y)^2 + 4(∂z'/∂z)^2 = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible transformations that can satisfy these conditions:\n\n1. Translations: Translations along the x, y, and z axes preserve the metric tensor. These are given by x' = x + a, y' = y + b, and z' = z + c, where a, b, and c are constants.\n\n2. Rotations: Rotations around the x-axis by an angle θ preserve the metric tensor. These are given by x' = x, y' = ycosθ - zsinθ, and z' = ysinθ + zcosθ.\n\n3. Dilations: Dilations along the y and z axes preserve the metric tensor. These are given by x' = x, y' = ky, and z' = lz, where k and l are constants.\n\n4. Reflections: Reflections with respect to the x, y, and z axes preserve the metric tensor. These are given by x' = -x, y' = -y, and z' = -z.\n\nCombining these transformations, we find that the isometry group of the manifold M is the semi-direct product of the translation group T(3), the rotation group SO(2), the dilation group D(2), and the reflection group Z_2^3, which can be denoted as:\n\nIsom(M) = T(3) ⋊ (SO(2) × D(2) × Z_2^3).\n\nThis is the isometry group of the manifold M with the given metric tensor g."
