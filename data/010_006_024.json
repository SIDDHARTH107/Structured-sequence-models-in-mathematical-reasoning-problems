    "message_2": "To determine the fundamental group of X, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, let's decompose X into two open sets U and V such that X = U ∪ V, and U ∩ V is path-connected.\n\nLet U be the solid torus with a small open neighborhood around its boundary, and let V be the space obtained by attaching a small open neighborhood of the pinched circle to the boundary of the solid torus. Then, U ∩ V is an open annulus, which is path-connected.\n\nNow, we need to determine the fundamental groups of U, V, and U ∩ V. \n\n1. The fundamental group of U: Since U is a solid torus with a small open neighborhood around its boundary, it is homotopy equivalent to the torus T^2. Thus, the fundamental group of U is π_1(U) = π_1(T^2) = Z ⊕ Z, generated by two loops a and b.\n\n2. The fundamental group of V: V is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of a 2-sphere and a circle, S^2 ∨ S^1. The fundamental group of a 2-sphere is trivial, and the fundamental group of a circle is Z. Thus, π_1(V) = Z, generated by a loop c.\n\n3. The fundamental group of U ∩ V: Since U ∩ V is an open annulus, it is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1. Thus, π_1(U ∩ V) = Z, generated by a loop d.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. We have:\n\nπ_1(X) = (π_1(U) * π_1(V)) / N\n\nwhere N is the normal subgroup generated by the relations i_U(d) = i_V(d) in π_1(U) * π_1(V). Here, i_U and i_V are the inclusion maps of U ∩ V into U and V, respectively.\n\nSince U ∩ V is an open annulus, we can choose d to be a loop that goes around the hole in the annulus. In U, this loop is homotopic to the loop a, so i_U(d) = a. In V, this loop is homotopic to the loop c, so i_V(d) = c.\n\nThus, N is generated by the relation a = c. Therefore, the fundamental group of X is:\n\nπ_1(X) = (Z ⊕ Z * Z) / ⟨a = c⟩ = Z ⊕ Z * Z / ⟨a = c⟩\n\nNow, we can simplify this group by eliminating the generator c:\n\nπ_1(X) = ⟨a, b | a = c⟩ = ⟨a, b⟩ = Z ⊕ Z\n\nSo, the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to Z ⊕ Z, which is the same as the fundamental group of a torus."
