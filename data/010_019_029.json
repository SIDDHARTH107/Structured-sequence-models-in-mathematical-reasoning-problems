    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology of the function $f$, we first need to understand the Morse complex. Recall that the Morse complex is generated by the critical points of the function, and the differential counts the number of gradient flow lines between critical points of consecutive indices.\n\nIn this case, we have two critical points: one of index $1$ and one of index $2$. Let's denote these critical points by $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively. The Morse complex is given by:\n\n$C_0 = 0$\n\n$C_1 = \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_1 \\rangle$\n\n$C_2 = \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_2 \\rangle$\n\n$C_k = 0$ for $k > 2$\n\nNow we need to compute the differential. Since there are no critical points of index $0$ or $3$, the only non-trivial differential is $\\partial_2: C_2 \\rightarrow C_1$. To compute this, we need to count the number of gradient flow lines from $p_2$ to $p_1$. Since $f$ is a smooth function and has exactly one critical point of each index, there must be a unique gradient flow line connecting them. Therefore, $\\partial_2(p_2) = p_1$.\n\nNow we can compute the Morse homology:\n\n$H_0 = \\ker(\\partial_1) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_2) = 0 / \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n$H_1 = \\ker(\\partial_2) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_3) = \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_1 \\rangle / 0 = \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_1 \\rangle$\n\n$H_2 = \\ker(\\partial_3) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_4) = \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_2 \\rangle / 0 = \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_2 \\rangle$\n\n$H_k = 0$ for $k > 2$\n\nSo the Morse homology of the function $f$ is given by:\n\n$H_0 = 0$\n\n$H_1 = \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_1 \\rangle$\n\n$H_2 = \\mathbb{Z} \\langle p_2 \\rangle$\n\n$H_k = 0$ for $k > 2$"
