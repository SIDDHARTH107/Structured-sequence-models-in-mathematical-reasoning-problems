    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm, a shorter base of 5 cm, and a longer base of 12 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the shorter base is 5 cm, the longer base is 12 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (5 + 12) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (17) * 8\nArea = 8.5 * 8\nArea = 68 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 68 square centimeters."
