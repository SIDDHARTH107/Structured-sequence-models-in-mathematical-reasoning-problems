    "message_2": "The 1-D Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by the following integral:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over all x.\n\nFor the Gaussian function f(x) = e^(-x^2), we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫[e^(-ax^2)] dx = √(π/a)\n\nIn our case, we need to complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-x^2 - 2πikx = -(x^2 + 2πikx + (πk)^2) + (πk)^2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Fourier transform integral as:\n\nF(k) = e^((πk)^2) ∫[e^(-(1 + 2πik)x^2)] dx\n\nUsing the Gaussian integral formula, we get:\n\nF(k) = e^((πk)^2) * √(π/(1 + 2πik))\n\nNow, let's see how this Fourier transform can be used to solve the 1-D diffusion equation:\n\nu_t = k u_xx\n\nWe can take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation:\n\n∂(U(k, t))/∂t = k ∂²(U(k, t))/∂k²\n\nThis is now an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time, which can be solved using standard ODE techniques. Once we have the solution U(k, t), we can take the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the solution u(x, t) in the spatial domain.\n\nIn fluid dynamics, the 1-D diffusion equation models the spreading of a substance (such as heat or mass) in a fluid due to random molecular motion. By solving the equation using the Fourier transform, we can predict the distribution of the substance at any given time."
