    "message_1": "In a team of two employees, the probability of each employee finishing their assigned task on time is 0.7. If one employee finishes early and is given a new task to complete, their probability of finishing the new task on time drops to 0.4 due to moral hazard. What is the probability that both tasks will be completed on time?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that the first employee finishes their assigned task on time, and B be the event that the second employee finishes their assigned task on time. We are given that P(A) = P(B) = 0.7.\n\nLet C be the event that the first employee finishes the new task on time, and D be the event that the second employee finishes the new task on time. We are given that P(C|A) = P(D|B) = 0.4.\n\nWe want to find the probability that both tasks will be completed on time, which can be represented as P(A and B and (C or D)). Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we can rewrite this as:\n\nP(A and B and (C or D)) = P(A and B and C) + P(A and B and D) - P(A and B and C and D)\n\nSince the events A, B, C, and D are not independent, we cannot simply multiply their probabilities. However, we can use conditional probabilities to find the joint probabilities:\n\nP(A and B and C) = P(A) * P(B|A) * P(C|A and B) = 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.196\nP(A and B and D) = P(A) * P(B|A) * P(D|A and B) = 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.196\n\nNow, we need to find P(A and B and C and D). Since an employee cannot finish both the new tasks on time, this probability is 0.\n\nSo, the probability that both tasks will be completed on time is:\n\nP(A and B and (C or D)) = P(A and B and C) + P(A and B and D) - P(A and B and C and D) = 0.196 + 0.196 - 0 = 0.392"
