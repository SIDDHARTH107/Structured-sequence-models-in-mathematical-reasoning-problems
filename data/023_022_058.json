    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the math student to solve related to Applying the Fourier transform to finance and economics:\n\nSuppose an investor holds a portfolio of 5 stocks, with the following expected returns for each stock over the next year (in percentage): 6, 8, 5, 10, and 7. Furthermore, assume that the Fourier transform of the return series is given by:\n\n```\nF(w) = 2.5 + 1.2i for w = 0.2\nF(w) = 1.5 - 0.5i for w = 0.5\nF(w) = 3.8 + 0.8i for w = 0.8\n```\n\nWhat is the expected return of the portfolio and its variance over the next year?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected return of the portfolio, we simply take the average of the expected returns for each stock:\n\nExpected return = (6 + 8 + 5 + 10 + 7) / 5 = 36 / 5 = 7.2%\n\nNow, to find the variance, we need to apply the inverse Fourier transform to the given Fourier transform values. The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) * ∫ F(w) * e^(iwt) dw\n\nWe need to find the variance of the return series, which is given by E[(R - E[R])^2], where R is the return series and E[R] is the expected return. To find this, we can use the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nE[(R - E[R])^2] = (1/2π) * ∫ |F(w)|^2 * e^(iwt) dw\n\nWe are given the Fourier transform values F(w) for w = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. We can calculate |F(w)|^2 for each value:\n\n|F(0.2)|^2 = (2.5 + 1.2i)(2.5 - 1.2i) = 2.5^2 + 1.2^2 = 6.25 + 1.44 = 7.69\n|F(0.5)|^2 = (1.5 - 0.5i)(1.5 + 0.5i) = 1.5^2 + 0.5^2 = 2.25 + 0.25 = 2.5\n|F(0.8)|^2 = (3.8 + 0.8i)(3.8 - 0.8i) = 3.8^2 + 0.8^2 = 14.44 + 0.64 = 15.08\n\nNow, we need to integrate these values over the range of w. Since we only have three values, we can approximate the integral using the trapezoidal rule:\n\nE[(R - E[R])^2] ≈ (1/2π) * (0.3 * (7.69 + 2.5) + 0.3 * (2.5 + 15.08))\n\nE[(R - E[R])^2] ≈ (1/2π) * (0.3 * 10.19 + 0.3 * 17.58) = (1/2π) * 8.331\n\nE[(R - E[R])^2] ≈ 1.326\n\nSo, the variance of the portfolio over the next year is approximately 1.326."
