    "message_1": "Unfortunately, epistemic logic is not conducive to numerical problems. Epistemic logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with knowledge and belief. It is concerned with reasoning about the beliefs and knowledge of agents (such as individuals, groups, or computational systems) based on their perceptions of the world. A question on epistemic logic would typically involve a scenario or description of a situation, and the student would need to reason about the beliefs and knowledge of the agents involved in the scenario. For example:\n\nScenario: You and your friend are playing a game of chess. Your friend makes a move that you believe is a mistake. \n\nQuestion: What can you infer about your friend's knowledge and beliefs regarding the game of chess based on their move?",
    "message_2": "Answer: Based on your friend's move that you believe is a mistake, you can infer several possibilities about their knowledge and beliefs regarding the game of chess:\n\n1. Your friend may not be aware of the optimal strategy or move in that particular situation, indicating a lack of knowledge or experience in the game.\n2. Your friend may have a different understanding or belief about the current state of the game, leading them to make a move that they think is beneficial but you perceive as a mistake.\n3. Your friend might be taking a risk or trying a new strategy, which may not align with conventional wisdom or your understanding of the game.\n4. It is also possible that your own assessment of the move as a mistake is incorrect, and your friend's move is actually a good one based on their knowledge and beliefs.\n\nIn summary, your friend's move could indicate a lack of knowledge, a different understanding of the game, a willingness to take risks, or even a potential error in your own assessment. To determine the exact reason behind their move, you would need more information about their thought process and experience with the game."
