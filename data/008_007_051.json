    "message_2": "To find the diagonal form of the matrix A, we need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then construct the diagonal matrix D with the eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[5, 2],\n [2, 3]]\n\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\ndet(A - λI) = det([[5 - λ, 2], [2, 3 - λ]])\n\n= (5 - λ)(3 - λ) - (2)(2)\n\n= λ^2 - 8λ + 9\n\nThe eigenvalues are the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to find them:\n\nλ = (8 ± √(8^2 - 4 * 9)) / 2\nλ = (8 ± √(64 - 36)) / 2\nλ = (8 ± √28) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (8 + √28) / 2 and λ2 = (8 - √28) / 2.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1:\n\n[[5 - (8 + √28) / 2, 2], [2, 3 - (8 + √28) / 2]] * [x, y] = [0, 0]\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v1 = [1, (3 - √28) / 2].\n\nFor λ2:\n\n[[5 - (8 - √28) / 2, 2], [2, 3 - (8 - √28) / 2]] * [x, y] = [0, 0]\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v2 = [1, (3 + √28) / 2].\n\nNow, we can construct the diagonal matrix D with the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nD = [[(8 + √28) / 2, 0],\n        [0, (8 - √28) / 2]]\n\nSo, the diagonal form of matrix A is:\n\nD = [[(8 + √28) / 2, 0],\n        [0, (8 - √28) / 2]]"
