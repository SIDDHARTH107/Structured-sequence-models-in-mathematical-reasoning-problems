    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, and its length increases with each order. In the Peano curve, the number of segments in each order is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of segments = 3^(order)\n\nFor order 4, we have:\n\nNumber of segments = 3^4 = 81\n\nSince each segment is 1 unit long, the length of the Peano curve of order 4 is 81 units."
