    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression log base 3 of (3^4/27), we can first rewrite the expression inside the logarithm:\n\n3^4/27 = 3^4/3^3\n\nNow, we can use the properties of exponents to simplify further:\n\n3^4/3^3 = 3^(4-3) = 3^1\n\nNow we can rewrite the logarithmic expression:\n\nlog base 3 of (3^1)\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that log base b of (b^x) = x, we can simplify the expression to:\n\n1\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is 1."
