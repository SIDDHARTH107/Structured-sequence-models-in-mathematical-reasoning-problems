    "message_1": "A factory produces two products A and B. The production of product A requires 2 hours of machine time, 3 hours of labor time and yields a profit of $5. The production of product B requires 1 hour of machine time, 2 hours of labor time and yields a profit of $4. \nThe factory has 4 machines and 8 laborers available for production. How many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y, subject to the constraints of machine time and labor time.\n\nMachine time constraint: 2x + y ≤ 4 * number of machines\nLabor time constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 8 * number of laborers\n\nSo we have the following linear programming problem:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 5x + 4y\nSubject to:\n2x + y ≤ 16 (machine time constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 64 (labor time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we will find the feasible region determined by the constraints and then evaluate the profit function at each of the corner points of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll graph the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 16\ny ≤ -2x + 16\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 64\ny ≤ (-3/2)x + 32\n\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with corner points at (0, 0), (0, 16), (8, 8), and (10.67, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = $0\nP(0, 16) = 5(0) + 4(16) = $64\nP(8, 8) = 5(8) + 4(8) = $72\nP(10.67, 0) = 5(10.67) + 4(0) = $53.35 (approx.)\n\nThe maximum profit of $72 is achieved when the factory produces 8 units of product A and 8 units of product B."
