    "message_2": "To calculate the value of the differential form omega at point p, we need to evaluate the form on a pair of tangent vectors at p. Let u = (u1, u2) and v = (v1, v2) be two tangent vectors at point p in the local coordinates.\n\nNow, we can evaluate omega on these tangent vectors:\n\nomega(u, v) = (dx1 ∧ dy1 + dx2 ∧ dy2)(u, v)\n           = (dx1 ∧ dy1)(u, v) + (dx2 ∧ dy2)(u, v)\n\nRecall that the wedge product of two 1-forms is given by:\n\n(dx ∧ dy)(u, v) = dx(u) * dy(v) - dx(v) * dy(u)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nomega(u, v) = (dx1(u) * dy1(v) - dx1(v) * dy1(u)) + (dx2(u) * dy2(v) - dx2(v) * dy2(u))\n\nNow, since dx1(u) = u1, dy1(u) = u2, dx2(u) = 0, dy2(u) = 0, dx1(v) = 0, dy1(v) = 0, dx2(v) = v1, and dy2(v) = v2, we get:\n\nomega(u, v) = (u1 * 0 - 0 * u2) + (0 * v2 - v1 * 0)\n           = 0\n\nThus, the value of the differential form omega at point p with local coordinates (x1(p), x2(p)) is 0."
