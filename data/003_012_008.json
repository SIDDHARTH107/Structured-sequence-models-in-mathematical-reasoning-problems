    "message_1": "A student is standing 20 meters away from a building. If the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 45 degrees, what is the height of the building to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the student to the building (the adjacent side) is 20 meters. We want to find the height of the building (the opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45Â°) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = opposite side / 20 meters\n\nTo find the height of the building (opposite side), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20 meters:\n\nopposite side = 1 * 20 meters\n\nopposite side = 20 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 20 meters."
