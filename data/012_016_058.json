    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial, also known as the Tutte–Whitney polynomial, is a polynomial invariant of a graph that generalizes several important graph invariants, such as the chromatic polynomial and the flow polynomial. It is defined as T(x, y) = ∑(r, k) A(r, k) x^(r - k) y^(k - c), where the sum is taken over all subgraphs of the given graph, r is the rank of the subgraph, k is the number of connected components, and c is the number of connected components of the original graph.\n\nFor the given graph, let's label the vertices as follows:\n\n```\n1 --- 2 --- 3\n|     |     |\n4 --- 5 --- 6\n```\n\nNow, we will compute the Tutte polynomial T(x, y) using the recursive deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT(G, x, y) = T(G - e, x, y) + T(G / e, x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G, x, y) = x * T(G - e, x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT(G, x, y) = y * T(G - e, x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nFor the given graph, we can start by deleting and contracting edge {1, 2}:\n\nT(G, x, y) = T(G - {1, 2}, x, y) + T(G / {1, 2}, x, y)\n\nNow, we have two smaller graphs to compute the Tutte polynomial for:\n\nG - {1, 2}:\n\n```\n1     2 --- 3\n|       |   |\n4 --- 5 --- 6\n```\n\nG / {1, 2}:\n\n```\n2 --- 3\n|     |\n4 --- 5 --- 6\n```\n\nContinuing the deletion-contraction process for each of these graphs and their subgraphs, we eventually obtain the Tutte polynomial for the original graph:\n\nT(G, x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1)^2(xy^2 - x^2y + x^2 - xy + x - y^2 + y)\n\nThis is the Tutte polynomial for the given graph."
