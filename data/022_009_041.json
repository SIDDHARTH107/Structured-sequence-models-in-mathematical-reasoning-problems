    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(-3)^{n+1}(x+1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{\\frac{(-3)^n(x+1)^n}{n!}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(-3)^{n+1}(x+1)^{n+1}n!}{(-3)^n(x+1)^n(n+1)!}\\right|$$\n\nCancel out common terms:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{-3(x+1)}{n+1}\\right|$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the limit becomes:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{3|x+1|}{n+1} = 0$$\n\nSince the limit is less than 1, the series converges for all x. Therefore, the radius of convergence is infinity.\n\nNow, let's find the interval of convergence. Since the radius of convergence is infinity, the interval of convergence is all real numbers:\n\n$$(-\\infty, \\infty)$$"
