    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial x^2 + 4x + 4, we can use the method of factoring by grouping.\n\nFirst, we look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (4) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (4). In this case, the two numbers are 2 and 2.\n\nNow, we rewrite the polynomial by breaking up the middle term using the two numbers we found:\n\nx^2 + 2x + 2x + 4\n\nNext, we group the terms in pairs:\n\n(x^2 + 2x) + (2x + 4)\n\nNow, we factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group:\n\nx(x + 2) + 2(x + 2)\n\nAt this point, we notice that both terms have a common factor of (x + 2). We can factor this out:\n\n(x + 2)(x + 2)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial x^2 + 4x + 4 is (x + 2)(x + 2) or (x + 2)^2."
