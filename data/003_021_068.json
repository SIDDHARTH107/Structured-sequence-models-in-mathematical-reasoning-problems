    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors A and B, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of two vectors A and B is given by:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product (A · B):\n\nA · B = (3 * 5) + (-4 * 2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNow, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + (-4)²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √(5² + 2²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n7 = 5 * √29 * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 * √29:\n\ncos(θ) = 7 / (5 * √29)\n\nNow, find the inverse cosine (arccos) to get the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(7 / (5 * √29))\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nθ ≈ 0.588 radians or 33.7°"
