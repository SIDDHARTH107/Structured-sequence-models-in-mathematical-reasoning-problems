    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of y = 2x + 3 on the interval [1, 5], we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 1 to 5.\n\nâˆ«(2x + 3) dx from 1 to 5\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative of 2x is x^2, and the antiderivative of 3 is 3x. So, the antiderivative of (2x + 3) is:\n\nx^2 + 3x + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of the interval:\n\n(x^2 + 3x) | from 1 to 5\n\n= (5^2 + 3*5) - (1^2 + 3*1)\n= (25 + 15) - (1 + 3)\n= 40 - 4\n= 36\n\nSo, the area under the curve of y = 2x + 3 on the interval [1, 5] is 36 square units."
