    "message_2": "To find the vertex and the axis of symmetry of the absolute value equation y = |x - 4| + 2, we first need to rewrite the equation in the vertex form of an absolute value function, which is y = a|x - h| + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the graph.\n\nIn this case, the equation is already in vertex form: y = 1|x - 4| + 2. Comparing this to the general vertex form, we can see that a = 1, h = 4, and k = 2.\n\nSo, the vertex of the absolute value equation is (h, k) = (4, 2).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. Since the vertex has an x-coordinate of 4, the equation for the axis of symmetry is x = 4."
