    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of x^4 in the expansion of (1+x)^5, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer n and any real numbers a and b:\n\n(a+b)^n = Î£ [C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k], where the sum is from k=0 to k=n, and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, also known as \"n choose k\" or the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items.\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = x, and n = 5. We want to find the coefficient of x^4, so we need to find the term when k = 4:\n\nC(5, 4) * 1^(5-4) * x^4 = C(5, 4) * 1^1 * x^4 = C(5, 4) * x^4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of C(5, 4). The formula for the binomial coefficient is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5! / (4!1!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(1)) = 5\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^4 in the expansion of (1+x)^5 is 5. The term is 5x^4."
