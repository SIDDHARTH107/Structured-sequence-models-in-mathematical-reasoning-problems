    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the magnetic field generated by the metal rod, we first need to find the expression for the magnetic field at the given point.\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart law, the magnetic field dB generated by a small current element Idz at a point P(x, 0, 0) is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dz * r) / (4 * π * |r|^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2 A), r is the vector from the current element to the point P, and |r| is the magnitude of r.\n\nThe position vector of the current element is (0, 0, z), and the position vector of the point P is (0.5, 0, 0). Therefore, the vector r is given by:\n\nr = (0.5, 0, -z)\n\nThe magnitude of r is |r| = sqrt(0.5^2 + 0^2 + (-z)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + z^2).\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the Biot-Savart law:\n\ndB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * dz * (0.5, 0, -z)) / (4 * π * (0.25 + z^2)^(3/2))\n\nThe magnetic field B at point P is the integral of dB along the z-axis from 0 to 1:\n\nB(x) = ∫(0 to 1) dB\n\nB(x) = ∫(0 to 1) (10^(-7) * 2 * dz * (0.5, 0, -z)) / ((0.25 + z^2)^(3/2))\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of B(x). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫(-∞ to ∞) f(x) * e^(-2πikx) dx\n\nThe Fourier transform of B(x) is:\n\nF_B(k) = ∫(-∞ to ∞) B(x) * e^(-2πikx) dx\n\nSince B(x) is nonzero only in the range 0 to 1, we can change the limits of integration:\n\nF_B(k) = ∫(0 to 1) B(x) * e^(-2πikx) dx\n\nF_B(k) = ∫(0 to 1) (10^(-7) * 2 * (0.5, 0, -z) * e^(-2πikx)) / ((0.25 + z^2)^(3/2)) dz\n\nThis integral is quite complex and cannot be easily solved analytically. To find the Fourier transform of the magnetic field, you would need to use numerical methods or specialized mathematical software to evaluate the integral."
