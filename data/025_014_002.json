    "message_2": "To find the roots of the function f(z) = z^4 + 4z^3 + 6z^2 + 4z + 1, we can notice that this polynomial is a binomial expansion of (z+1)^4. \n\nExpanding (z+1)^4 using the binomial theorem, we get:\n\n(z+1)^4 = C(4,0)z^4 + C(4,1)z^3 + C(4,2)z^2 + C(4,3)z + C(4,4)\n\nwhere C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient, which is equal to n!/(k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(z+1)^4 = (1)z^4 + (4)z^3 + (6)z^2 + (4)z + (1)\n\nThis is the same as our given polynomial f(z) = z^4 + 4z^3 + 6z^2 + 4z + 1.\n\nSince f(z) = (z+1)^4, the only root of f(z) is z = -1, with multiplicity 4 (meaning it is a root four times).\n\nNow, let's verify that the sum of the roots of f(z) is -4. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a polynomial of the form:\n\na_nz^n + a_(n-1)z^(n-1) + ... + a_1z + a_0\n\nis given by -a_(n-1)/a_n.\n\nIn our case, a_n = 1 and a_(n-1) = 4. So, the sum of the roots is:\n\n-4/1 = -4\n\nSince the only root of f(z) is -1 with multiplicity 4, the sum of the roots is indeed -1 + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -4."
