    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of the given sine wave function f(x) = sin(3x), we need to apply the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the entire range of x, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = sin(3x), the Fourier transform is:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[-π to π] [sin(3x) * e^(-iωx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = sin(3x) and dv = e^(-iωx) dx\nThen, du = 3cos(3x) dx and v = (-1/iω) * e^(-iωx)\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\nF(ω) = uv |[-π, π] - ∫[-π to π] [v * du]\n\nF(ω) = [(-1/iω) * e^(-iωx) * sin(3x)] |[-π, π] - ∫[-π to π] [(-1/iω) * e^(-iωx) * 3cos(3x)] dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the first term and solve the remaining integral:\n\nF(ω) = [(-1/iω) * (e^(-iωπ) * sin(3π) - e^(iωπ) * sin(-3π))] - (3/iω) * ∫[-π to π] [e^(-iωx) * cos(3x)] dx\n\nSince sin(3π) = sin(-3π) = 0, the first term becomes 0. Now, we only need to solve the remaining integral:\n\nF(ω) = (-3/iω) * ∫[-π to π] [e^(-iωx) * cos(3x)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Euler's formula: e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)\n\nF(ω) = (-3/iω) * ∫[-π to π] [(cos(ωx) - i*sin(ωx)) * cos(3x)] dx\n\nNow, we can separate the integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = (-3/iω) * [∫[-π to π] [cos(ωx) * cos(3x)] dx - i * ∫[-π to π] [sin(ωx) * cos(3x)] dx]\n\nThe first integral can be solved using the product-to-sum formula, and the second integral is an odd function, so its integral over a symmetric interval is zero:\n\nF(ω) = (-3/iω) * [π * (δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)) - 0]\n\nF(ω) = (-3π/iω) * (δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3))\n\nThe frequency domain representation of the given sine wave function is F(ω) = (-3π/iω) * (δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)). The maximum amplitude in the Fourier transformed function corresponds to the Dirac delta functions at ω = ±3.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the sinusoidal component with maximum amplitude in the Fourier transformed function is ω = ±3. To convert angular frequency to regular frequency, we use the formula f = ω/(2π):\n\nf = ±3/(2π)\n\nSo, the frequency of the sinusoidal component with maximum amplitude is f = ±3/(2π) Hz."
