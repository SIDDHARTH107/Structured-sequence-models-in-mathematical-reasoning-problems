    "message_1": "Let f(z) be an entire function such that |f(z)| ≤ 6|z|^2 + 4 for all z in the complex plane. Prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2.\n\nAlternatively, find a non-constant entire function that satisfies |f(z)| ≤ 6|z|^2 + 4 for all z in the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "We will prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2.\n\nSince f(z) is entire, it can be represented by its Taylor series expansion about 0:\n\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + ...\n\nNow, consider the function g(z) = f(z) - a_0 - a_1z - a_2z^2. Then g(z) is also entire, and we have:\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z) - a_0 - a_1z - a_2z^2| ≤ 6|z|^2 + 4 - |a_0| - |a_1z| - |a_2z^2|\n\nWe will now show that g(z) must be identically zero, which implies that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that g(z) is not identically zero. Then there exists a smallest positive integer n ≥ 3 such that the coefficient a_n of z^n in the Taylor series expansion of g(z) is nonzero. Let h(z) = g(z)/z^n. Then h(z) is also entire, and we have:\n\n|h(z)| = |g(z)/z^n| ≤ (6|z|^2 + 4 - |a_0| - |a_1z| - |a_2z^2|)/|z|^n\n\nNow, let R > 0 be a large positive number such that |z| = R implies |a_1z| + |a_2z^2| ≤ 2|z|^2. Then, for |z| = R, we have:\n\n|h(z)| ≤ (6|z|^2 + 4 - |a_0|)/|z|^n = (6R^2 + 4 - |a_0|)/R^n\n\nSince n ≥ 3, we can take the limit as R goes to infinity:\n\nlim (R→∞) (6R^2 + 4 - |a_0|)/R^n = 0\n\nBy the Maximum Modulus Principle, since |h(z)| is bounded on the circle |z| = R and goes to 0 as R goes to infinity, it follows that h(z) must be identically zero. But this contradicts our assumption that a_n is nonzero, which implies that g(z) must be identically zero.\n\nTherefore, f(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 is a polynomial of degree at most 2."
