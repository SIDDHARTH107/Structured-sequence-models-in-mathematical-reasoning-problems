    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2 cos(x) - 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2pi], we first isolate cos(x):\n\n2 cos(x) - 1 = 0\n2 cos(x) = 1\ncos(x) = 1/2\n\nNow we need to find all the angles x in the interval [0, 2pi] that have a cosine value of 1/2. We know that cos(pi/3) = 1/2 and cos(5pi/3) = 1/2. These are the two angles in the given interval that satisfy the equation:\n\nx = pi/3, 5pi/3"
