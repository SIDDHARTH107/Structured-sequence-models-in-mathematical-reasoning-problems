    "message_2": "To show that the intersection of A and B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B, we first need to find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B (A ∩ B) = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of set A and set B, we can see that the common elements are 3 and 9.\n\nSo, A ∩ B = {3, 9}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∩ B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if set C is a subset of set D, then every element of set C is also an element of set D.\n\n1. A ∩ B is a subset of set A:\n\nTo prove this, we need to show that every element of A ∩ B is also an element of set A.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 9}\nSet A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nWe can see that both 3 and 9 are elements of set A.
