    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product A x B, we take each element of set A and pair it with each element of set B. Similarly, for B x A, we take each element of set B and pair it with each element of set A.\n\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow let's find the union of A x B and B x A:\n\n(A x B) âˆª (B x A) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nSince A x B and B x A have different ordered pairs, they are not equal. The union of the two sets contains all the ordered pairs from both sets, but this does not make the two sets equal."
