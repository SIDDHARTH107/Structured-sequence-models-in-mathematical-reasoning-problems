Find the minimum value of this function using differential evolution algorithm, where x and y are real-valued variables in the range of [-5,5].\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the differential evolution algorithm, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population: Generate a random population of candidate solutions within the given range of [-5, 5] for both x and y.\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness: Calculate the value of the function f(x, y) for each candidate solution in the population.\n\n3. Perform mutation: For each candidate solution, create a mutant vector by adding the weighted difference of two randomly selected solutions to a third randomly selected solution.\n\n4. Perform crossover: For each candidate solution, create a trial vector by mixing the components of the mutant vector and the original candidate solution.\n\n5. Evaluate the trial vector: Calculate the value of the function f(x, y) for each trial vector.\n\n6. Perform selection: If the trial vector has a better fitness (lower value of f(x, y)) than the original candidate solution, replace the original candidate solution with the trial vector.\n\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.\n\n8. Identify the best solution: Find the candidate solution with the lowest value of f(x, y) in the final population.\n\nHere's a Python implementation using the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef f(params):\n    x, y = params\n    return (x**2 + y - 11)**2 + (x + y**2 - 7)**2\n\nbounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]\n\nresult = differential_evolution(f, bounds)\n\nprint(\"Minimum value of the function: \", result.fun)\nprint(\"Optimal parameters (x, y): \", result.x)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the minimum value of the function and the corresponding values of x and y. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the differential evolution algorithm."
