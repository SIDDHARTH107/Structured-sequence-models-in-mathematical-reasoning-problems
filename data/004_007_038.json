    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = sin(2x^2 - 5x + 3) with respect to x, we can use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x^2 - 5x + 3.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\nd(sin(u))/du = cos(u)\n\nNext, find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\nd(2x^2 - 5x + 3)/dx = 4x - 5\n\nNow, apply the chain rule by multiplying the derivatives and substituting the inner function back in for u:\nf'(x) = d(sin(2x^2 - 5x + 3))/dx = cos(u) * (4x - 5) = cos(2x^2 - 5x + 3) * (4x - 5)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = cos(2x^2 - 5x + 3) * (4x - 5)"
