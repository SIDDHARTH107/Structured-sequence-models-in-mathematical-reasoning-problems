    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 4y + 1$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y - 4$\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$2x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1$\n\n$2y - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 2$\n\nSo, the critical point is $(1, 2)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify this critical point as a maximum, minimum, or saddle point using Morse theory. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are the diagonal elements, which are both positive. According to Morse theory, if all eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are positive, the critical point is a local minimum. If all eigenvalues are negative, it is a local maximum. If there are both positive and negative eigenvalues, it is a saddle point.\n\nIn this case, both eigenvalues are positive, so the critical point $(1, 2)$ is a local minimum."
