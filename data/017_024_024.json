    "message_2": "To determine whether the given group of order 96 is isomorphic to C96, A4 × C4 × C2, or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96, we need to analyze the possible structures of the group.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 96: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, both of these subgroups are normal. The group would be a direct product of these subgroups, and since 2 and 3 are coprime, the group would be cyclic. Therefore, the group would be isomorphic to C96.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. The group would have a semi-direct product structure. Since there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups, the group cannot be abelian. Therefore, the group would be one of the non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. The group would have a semi-direct product structure. Since there are multiple Sylow 3-subgroups, the group cannot be abelian. Therefore, the group would be one of the non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups and multiple Sylow 3-subgroups. The group cannot be abelian. Therefore, the group would be one of the non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nTo summarize, the given group of order 96 can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C96 or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. However, it cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, as this group is a direct product of three abelian groups and is itself abelian."
