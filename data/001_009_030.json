    "message_2": "To simplify the given expression, we need to distribute the numbers outside the parentheses and then combine like terms.\n\n2x + 3(x - 4) - 5(2x + 1)\n\nFirst, distribute the 3 and the -5:\n\n2x + 3x - 12 - 10x - 5\n\nNow, combine like terms (the terms with x and the constants):\n\n(2x + 3x - 10x) + (-12 - 5)\n\n-5x - 17\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n-5x - 17"
