    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^2/2 + ln(x) between x = 1 and x = 2, we will use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^2/2 + ln(x)\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2/2)/dx + d(ln(x))/dx\n\ndy/dx = x + 1/x\n\nNow, we will square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = 1 + (x + 1/x)^2\n\n= 1 + (x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2)\n\nNow, we will find the square root of the expression:\n\n√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = √(1 + x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2)\n\n= √(x^2 + 1/x^2 + 3)\n\nNow, we will integrate this expression with respect to x from 1 to 2:\n\nL = ∫[1, 2] √(x^2 + 1/x^2 + 3) dx\n\nThis integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, we can approximate the value of the integral using numerical methods, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integration calculator.\n\nUsing a numerical integration calculator, we find that:\n\nL ≈ 1.919\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^2/2 + ln(x) between x = 1 and x = 2 is approximately 1.919."
