    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow that can be transported from node A to node F, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will start with an initial flow of 0 and iteratively find augmenting paths to increase the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initial flow: 0\n2. Find an augmenting path: A -> B -> E -> F with bottleneck capacity 6 (the minimum capacity along the path)\n3. Update the flow: flow = 0 + 6 = 6\n4. Find an augmenting path: A -> B -> D with bottleneck capacity 4\n5. Update the flow: flow = 6 + 4 = 10\n6. Find an augmenting path: A -> C -> G -> E -> F with bottleneck capacity 5\n7. Update the flow: flow = 10 + 5 = 15\n8. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow that can be transported from node A to node F is 15 units.\n\nThe pipes used to achieve this flow are:\n- Pipe 1 (A -> B) with 10 units\n- Pipe 2 (A -> C) with 5 units\n- Pipe 3 (B -> E) with 6 units\n- Pipe 4 (B -> D) with 4 units\n- Pipe 5 (C -> G) with 5 units\n- Pipe 6 (E -> F) with 6 units\n- Pipe 7 (G -> E) with 5 units"
