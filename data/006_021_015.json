    "message_1": "A certain species of bird has a 30% chance of being found in a particular forest. If a researcher randomly selects 10 locations in the forest, what is the probability that the bird will be found in at least 3 of the locations?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of finding the bird in exactly k locations\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of finding the bird in a single location (30% or 0.3)\n- n is the number of locations (10)\n- k is the number of locations where the bird is found\n\nWe want to find the probability of finding the bird in at least 3 locations, so we need to calculate the probabilities for k = 3, 4, 5, ..., 10 and sum them up.\n\nP(X >= 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + ... + P(X = 10)\n\nCalculating each probability:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * 0.3^3 * 0.7^7 ≈ 0.2668\nP(X = 4) = C(10, 4) * 0.3^4 * 0.7^6 ≈ 0.3504\nP(X = 5) = C(10, 5) * 0.3^5 * 0.7^5 ≈ 0.1029\nP(X = 6) = C(10, 6) * 0.3^6 * 0.7^4 ≈ 0.0368\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.3^7 * 0.7^3 ≈ 0.0076\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.3^8 * 0.7^2 ≈ 0.0009\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.3^9 * 0.7^1 ≈ 0.0001\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.3^10 * 0.7^0 ≈ 0.0000 (rounded)\n\nAdding up the probabilities:\n\nP(X >= 3) ≈ 0.2668 + 0.3504 + 0.1029 + 0.0368 + 0.0076 + 0.0009 + 0.0001 + 0.0000 ≈ 0.7655\n\nSo, the probability of finding the bird in at least 3 of the 10 locations is approximately 76.55%."
