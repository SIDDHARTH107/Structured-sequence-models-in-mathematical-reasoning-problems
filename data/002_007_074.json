    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and two parallel sides of 12 cm and 18 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (sum of parallel sides) × height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 12 cm and 18 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (12 + 18) × 8\nArea = (1/2) × 30 × 8\nArea = 15 × 8\nArea = 120 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 120 square centimeters."
