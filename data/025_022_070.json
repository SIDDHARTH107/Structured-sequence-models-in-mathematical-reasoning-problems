    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of Hom(F, G), we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for the curve X. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a curve X of genus g, we have:\n\ndim(H^0(X, L)) - dim(H^1(X, L)) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nIn our case, we want to compute Hom(F, G), which is equivalent to computing H^0(X, G/F). Since G = O_X(2) and F = O_X(1), we have G/F = O_X(1). Thus, we want to compute the dimension of H^0(X, O_X(1)).\n\nThe degree of O_X(1) is 1, and since X is a cubic curve, its genus g is given by the formula:\n\ng = (3 - 1)(3 - 2)/2 = 1\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\ndim(H^0(X, O_X(1))) - dim(H^1(X, O_X(1))) = 1 + 1 - 1\n\ndim(H^0(X, O_X(1))) - dim(H^1(X, O_X(1))) = 1\n\nSince H^1(X, O_X(1)) is dual to H^0(X, O_X(-1)), and O_X(-1) has negative degree, H^0(X, O_X(-1)) = 0. Therefore, dim(H^1(X, O_X(1))) = 0.\n\nSo, we have:\n\ndim(H^0(X, O_X(1))) = 1\n\nThus, the dimension of Hom(F, G) in D(X) is 1."
