    "message_2": "To find the tangent line of X at point P, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to x. The given equation is:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + 1$\n\nNow, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using implicit differentiation:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + x^2 + 1)$\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 2x$\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at point P (1,1). We will substitute the coordinates of P into the equation:\n\n$2(1)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(1)^2 + 2(1)$\n\n$2\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3 + 2$\n\n$2\\frac{dy}{dx} = 5$\n\nNow, we can solve for the slope of the tangent line:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{5}{2}$\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\nSubstitute the coordinates of P (1,1) and the slope $\\frac{5}{2}$:\n\n$y - 1 = \\frac{5}{2}(x - 1)$\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n$y - 1 = \\frac{5}{2}x - \\frac{5}{2}$\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{2}x - \\frac{5}{2} + 1$\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line of X at point P is:\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}$"
