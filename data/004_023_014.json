    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x² and y = 2x - 1 in the interval [-1, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx² = 2x - 1\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to find the x-values of the intersection points:\n\nx² - 2x + 1 = 0\n(x - 1)² = 0\n\nThe only solution to this equation is x = 1. So, the two curves intersect at the point (1, 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the area enclosed between the curves in the given interval. We can do this by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 1 - x²) dx from -1 to 2\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\nF(x) = x² - (1/3)x³ + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of the interval and subtract:\n\nArea = F(2) - F(-1)\nArea = [(2² - (1/3)(2³)) - ((-1)² - (1/3)(-1)³)]\nArea = [(4 - (8/3)) - (1 + (1/3))]\nArea = [(4 - 8/3) - (1 - 1/3)]\nArea = [(-4/3) - (2/3)]\nArea = -2\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = |-2| = 2\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y = x² and y = 2x - 1 in the interval [-1, 2] is 2 square units."
