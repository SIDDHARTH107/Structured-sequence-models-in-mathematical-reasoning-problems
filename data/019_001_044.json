    "message_2": "This proposition is an example of a conditional statement, which is in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"2 + 2 = 5\" and Q is \"6 - 3 = 4.\" \n\nA conditional statement is considered true unless a situation arises where P is true and Q is false. In this case, P is false because 2 + 2 = 4, not 5. Since P is false, the conditional statement is true regardless of the truth value of Q. Therefore, the proposition \"If 2 + 2 = 5, then 6 - 3 = 4\" is true."
