The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, contains the elements that are present in both set A and set B.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of set A and set B, we find that the common elements are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nSo, A ∩ B = {4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∩ B is a subset of set A and set B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. If all elements of set C are also elements of set D, then set C is a subset of set D, denoted as C ⊆ D.\n\nTo prove that A ∩ B is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of set A.\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 6, 8} and set A = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nSince all elements of A ∩ B are also elements of set A, we can conclude that A ∩ B ⊆ A.\n\nSimilarly, to prove that A ∩ B is a subset of set B, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of set B.\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 6, 8} and set B = {4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nSince all elements of A ∩ B are also elements of set B, we can conclude that A ∩ B ⊆ B.\n\nThus, we have shown that the intersection of sets A and B, A ∩ B, is a subset of both set A and set B."
