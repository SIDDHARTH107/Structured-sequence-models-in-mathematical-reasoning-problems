Find the differential equation that models the population growth and use it to determine how long it will take for the population to reach 700,000 individuals.",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth, we can use the differential equation for exponential growth:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, and k is the growth rate.\n\nIn this case, the growth rate k is 3% per year, so k = 0.03.\n\nNow we have the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = 0.03P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.03 dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find C, we can use the initial condition that the population is 500,000 when t = 0:\n\nln(500,000) = 0.03(0) + C\n\nC = ln(500,000)\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + ln(500,000)\n\nTo find the time it takes for the population to reach 700,000, we can set P = 700,000 and solve for t:\n\nln(700,000) = 0.03t + ln(500,000)\n\nSubtract ln(500,000) from both sides:\n\nln(700,000) - ln(500,000) = 0.03t\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:\n\nln(700,000/500,000) = 0.03t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = (ln(700,000/500,000))/0.03\n\nt â‰ˆ 11.09 years\n\nSo it will take approximately 11.09 years for the population to reach 700,000 individuals."
