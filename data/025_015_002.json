    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane containing the line passing through the points (1, 2, 3) and (2, -1, 4), we first need to find the direction vector of the line. The direction vector can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the two points:\n\nDirection vector = (2 - 1, -1 - 2, 4 - 3) = (1, -3, 1)\n\nNow, we know that the plane we are looking for is parallel to the plane given by the equation 3x + 2y + z = 6. Since the two planes are parallel, their normal vectors must be proportional. Let the normal vector of the given plane be N1 = (3, 2, 1). \n\nLet N2 = (a, b, c) be the normal vector of the plane we are looking for. Since N1 and N2 are proportional, there exists a constant k such that:\n\nN2 = k * N1\n(a, b, c) = k * (3, 2, 1)\n\nNow, the direction vector of the line contained in the plane we are looking for is (1, -3, 1). The dot product of the direction vector and the normal vector of the plane must be zero, as they are orthogonal:\n\n(1, -3, 1) · (a, b, c) = 0\n\nSubstituting the proportional relationship between N1 and N2:\n\n(1, -3, 1) · (3k, 2k, k) = 0\n\nSolving for k:\n\n3k - 6k + k = 0\n-2k = 0\nk = 0\n\nHowever, k cannot be zero, as this would mean that the normal vector N2 is the zero vector, which is not possible for a plane. This means that there is no plane containing the line passing through the points (1, 2, 3) and (2, -1, 4) that is parallel to the given plane 3x + 2y + z = 6."
