Assume that at each step, the algorithm checks all possible numbers that can be placed in an empty cell and chooses the number that does not violate any of the Sudoku rules.",
    "message_2": "In the worst case, an exhaustive search algorithm for solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle would require exploring all possible combinations of numbers in the empty cells. In a completely empty 9x9 grid, there are 81 cells, and each cell can have any of the 9 possible numbers (1 to 9).\n\nSo, the total number of possible combinations to explore is 9^81, which is approximately 1.97 x 10^77.\n\nHowever, this number represents the total number of possible combinations, not the number of steps required to solve the puzzle. The actual number of steps will depend on the specific algorithm used and the efficiency of the algorithm in pruning the search space.\n\nIn the case of a backtracking algorithm, which is a common exhaustive search method for solving Sudoku puzzles, the number of steps will be significantly lower than the total number of possible combinations. The backtracking algorithm will place a number in an empty cell, check if it violates any Sudoku rules, and if it does, it will backtrack and try the next possible number. This process continues until a solution is found.\n\nThe number of steps required for a backtracking algorithm will depend on the initial configuration of the puzzle and the efficiency of the algorithm in pruning the search space. It is difficult to provide an exact number of steps, as it will vary for each puzzle. However, it is generally much lower than the total number of possible combinations (9^81)."
