    "message_2": "To determine if G and H are isomorphic, we need to find a bijection (one-to-one and onto function) between the vertices of G and H such that the adjacency relationships are preserved.\n\nFirst, let's look at the degrees of the vertices in both graphs:\n\nFor G:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 2\n- Vertex 2 has degree 3\n- Vertex 3 has degree 3\n- Vertex 4 has degree 2\n\nFor H:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 3\n- Vertex 2 has degree 2\n- Vertex 3 has degree 2\n- Vertex 4 has degree 3\n\nWe can see that both graphs have the same number of vertices with the same degrees. Now, let's try to find a bijection between the vertices.\n\nOne possible bijection is:\n- f(1) = 2\n- f(2) = 1\n- f(3) = 3\n- f(4) = 4\n\nNow, let's check if the adjacency relationships are preserved:\n\nFor G:\n- (1, 2) is an edge\n- (1, 3) is an edge\n- (2, 3) is an edge\n- (2, 4) is an edge\n- (3, 4) is an edge\n\nFor H (using the bijection):\n- (2, 1) is an edge\n- (2, 3) is an edge\n- (1, 3) is an edge\n- (1, 4) is an edge\n- (3, 4) is an edge\n\nThe adjacency relationships are preserved under the bijection, so G and H are isomorphic. The isomorphism is given by the bijection f: {1 -> 2, 2 -> 1, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4}."
