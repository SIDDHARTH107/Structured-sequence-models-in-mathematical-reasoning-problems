    "message_2": "To find the exact values of sine and cosine for a 45° angle using the unit circle method, we first need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. \n\n45° * (π/180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, let's consider a right triangle with one angle being 45° (π/4 radians) and the other angle being 90° - 45° = 45°. Since the two non-right angles are equal, this is an isosceles right triangle, which means the two legs are of equal length.\n\nLet's call the length of each leg x. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + x^2 = (hypotenuse)^2\n\n2x^2 = (hypotenuse)^2\n\nNow, since we are using the unit circle method, the hypotenuse of the triangle is the radius of the unit circle, which is 1. So:\n\n2x^2 = 1^2\n2x^2 = 1\nx^2 = 1/2\nx = √(1/2)\n\nNow we can find the sine and cosine values for the 45° angle:\n\nsin(45°) = sin(π/4) = opposite/hypotenuse = x/1 = √(1/2)\ncos(45°) = cos(π/4) = adjacent/hypotenuse = x/1 = √(1/2)\n\nSo, the exact values of sine and cosine for the angle 45° are:\n\nsin(45°) = √(1/2)\ncos(45°) = √(1/2)"
