    "message_2": "To calculate the treewidth of the given graph, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find a tree decomposition of the graph.\n2. Determine the width of the tree decomposition.\n3. The treewidth of the graph is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions.\n\nLet's find a tree decomposition of the graph:\n\n1. Start with an empty tree T.\n2. Add a bag containing all vertices of the graph to T (bag B1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}).\n3. Remove vertex 1 from B1, and create a new bag B2 = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Connect B1 and B2 in T.\n4. Remove vertex 2 from B2, and create a new bag B3 = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Connect B2 and B3 in T.\n5. Remove vertex 3 from B3, and create a new bag B4 = {4, 5, 6}. Connect B3 and B4 in T.\n6. Remove vertex 4 from B4, and create a new bag B5 = {5, 6}. Connect B4 and B5 in T.\n\nNow, we have a tree decomposition T with bags B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5.\n\nNext, let's determine the width of the tree decomposition:\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of its largest bag minus 1. In our case, the largest bag is B1 with 6 vertices. So, the width of the tree decomposition is 6 - 1 = 5.\n\nFinally, the treewidth of the graph is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions. In this case, we have found a tree decomposition with width 5, so the treewidth of the graph is at most 5. It's possible to show that there is no tree decomposition with a smaller width, so the treewidth of the graph is 5."
