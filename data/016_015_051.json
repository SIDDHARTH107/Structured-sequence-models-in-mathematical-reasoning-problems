    "message_1": "Consider the construction of the Hilbert curve, which begins with a straight line segment of length 1. At each iteration, the line segment is replaced by a pattern that looks like the letter \"L\" and has a length of 1. The pattern is oriented in different directions to connect the line segments to form a curve. If the curve is constructed using 10 iterations, what is the total length of the curve?",
    "message_2": "At each iteration of the Hilbert curve construction, the number of line segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment remains the same. Therefore, after 10 iterations, the total number of line segments will be 4^10.\n\nSince the length of each line segment is 1, the total length of the curve after 10 iterations will be 4^10 * 1 = 1,048,576."
