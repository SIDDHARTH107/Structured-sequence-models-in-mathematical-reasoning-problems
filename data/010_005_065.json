    "message_2": "To determine if X is connected, we need to check if there are any non-empty, disjoint open sets that cover X. Recall that a space is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets.\n\nConsider the open sets A = {a} and B = {b, c, d}. We have A ∪ B = X, and A ∩ B = ∅. Since A and B are both non-empty and disjoint, X is not connected.\n\nNow let's check if X is path-connected. A space is path-connected if for any two points x, y ∈ X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nNotice that the topology T does not contain the set {a, c} or {b, d}. This means that there is no continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = a and f(1) = c, or f(0) = b and f(1) = d, because the preimage of {a, c} or {b, d} under f would not be an open set in the standard topology on [0, 1].\n\nThus, X is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the topological space X is neither connected nor path-connected."
