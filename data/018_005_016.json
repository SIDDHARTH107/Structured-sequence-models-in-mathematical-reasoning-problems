    "message_1": "Let A = {1,2,3,4,5} be a set of integers. Find the intersection of set A and its complement.",
    "message_2": "The complement of a set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements that are not in set A. Since set A has elements {1,2,3,4,5}, its complement A' will have all the other integers except these five. The intersection of set A and its complement A' (denoted as A ∩ A') represents the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nHowever, by definition, the complement of a set contains elements that are not in the original set. Therefore, there are no common elements between set A and its complement A'. So, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}."
