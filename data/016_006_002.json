    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern algorithm generates points iteratively using a set of affine transformations with given probabilities. The number of points generated is directly related to the number of iterations performed. \n\nIn this case, if we want to generate a fern with a total of 10,000 points, we would need to perform 10,000 iterations of the algorithm. Each iteration generates one point, so after 10,000 iterations, we would have a fern with 10,000 points."
