    "message_2": "The nth row of Pascal's triangle can be represented by the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (x+y)^(n-1). In this case, we are looking for the 10th row, so we will consider the expansion of (x+y)^9.\n\nThe coefficients of the expansion are given by the binomial coefficients, which are the entries in Pascal's triangle. The binomial coefficient C(n, k) is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n! is the factorial of n.\n\nTo determine if a number is odd, we can look at its prime factorization. If a number has no factors of 2, it is odd. So, we need to find the number of entries in the 10th row of Pascal's triangle that have no factors of 2 in their prime factorization.\n\nWe can use the property that C(n, k) is odd if and only if there are no carries when adding n and k in base 2. In this case, n = 9, which is 1001 in base 2.\n\nNow, we can check the entries in the 10th row of Pascal's triangle:\n\n- C(9, 0) = 1 (odd)\n- C(9, 1) = 9 (odd)\n- C(9, 2) = 36 (even)\n- C(9, 3) = 84 (even)\n- C(9, 4) = 126 (even)\n- C(9, 5) = 126 (even)\n- C(9, 6) = 84 (even)\n- C(9, 7) = 36 (even)\n- C(9, 8) = 9 (odd)\n- C(9, 9) = 1 (odd)\n\nThere are 4 odd numbers in the 10th row of Pascal's triangle."
