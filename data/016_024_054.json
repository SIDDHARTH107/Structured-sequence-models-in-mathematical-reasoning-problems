    "message_2": "The number of open squares in the Sierpinski carpet after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nOpen squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nFor the fifth iteration:\n\nOpen squares = (8^5 - 1) / 7\nOpen squares = (32,768 - 1) / 7\nOpen squares = 32,767 / 7\nOpen squares = 4,681\n\nSo, there are 4,681 open squares remaining in the Sierpinski carpet after the fifth iteration."
