The company wants to optimize the delivery route in order to minimize the total distance traveled. The distance between each location is given below:\n\n|       | Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 | Location 4 | Location 5 |\n| ----- | ----------| ----------| ----------| ----------| ----------|\n| **Location 1** | 0 | 4 | 5 | 2 | 7 |\n| **Location 2** | 4 | 0 | 8 | 1 | 6 |\n| **Location 3** | 5 | 8 | 0 | 3 | 9 |\n| **Location 4** | 2 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 5 |\n| **Location 5** | 7 | 6 | 9 | 5 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the optimal delivery route for the company to follow in order to minimize the total distance traveled? Find the total distance traveled using the optimal route.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal delivery route, we can use the traveling salesman problem approach. We will try to find the shortest route that visits each location exactly once and returns to the starting location. In this case, we can use brute force to check all possible routes since there are only 5 locations.\n\nThere are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, which is equal to 120 routes. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5, which gives us 24 unique routes to check.\n\nHere are all the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1-2-3-4-5-1: 4 + 8 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 27\n1-2-3-5-4-1: 4 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 2 = 28\n1-2-4-3-5-1: 4 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 24\n1-2-4-5-3-1: 4 + 1 + 5 + 9 + 5 = 24\n1-2-5-3-4-1: 4 + 6 + 9 + 3 + 2 = 24\n1-2-5-4-3-1: 4 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 23\n\n1-3-2-4-5-1: 5 + 8 + 1 + 5 + 7 = 26\n1-3-2-5-4-1: 5 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 2 = 26\n1-3-4-2-5-1: 5 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 7 = 22\n1-3-4-5-2-1: 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 23\n1-3-5-2-4-1: 5 + 9 + 6 + 1 + 2 = 23\n1-3-5-4-2-1: 5 + 9 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 24\n\n1-4-2-3-5-1: 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 27\n1-4-2-5-3-1: 2 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 5 = 23\n1-4-3-2-5-1: 2 + 3 + 8 + 6 + 7 = 26\n1-4-3-5-2-1: 2 + 3 + 9 + 6 + 4 = 24\n1-4-5-2-3-1: 2 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 5 = 26\n1-4-5-3-2-1: 2 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 4 = 28\n\n1-5-2-3-4-1: 7 + 6 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 26\n1-5-2-4-3-1: 7 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 22\n1-5-3-2-4-1: 7 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 2 = 27\n1-5-3-4-2-1: 7 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 24\n1-5-4-2-3-1: 7 + 5 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 26\n1-5-4-3-2-1: 7 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 4 = 27\n\nThe shortest route is 1-4-2-5-3-1 with a total distance of 22. So, the optimal delivery route is Location 1 -> Location 4 -> Location 2 -> Location 5 -> Location 3 -> Location 1, and the total distance traveled is 22 units."
