    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is at least one vertex that cannot be reached from another vertex. In other words, we need to create a situation where there is no path between at least one pair of vertices.\n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles and has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In our case, a tree with 7 vertices would have 6 edges. If we remove one more edge from a tree, it will become disconnected.\n\nSo, we need to remove at least 9 - 6 = 3 edges from the graph G to disconnect it. Therefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph G is 3."
