    "message_1": "A candy jar contains 50 red candies, 30 green candies, and 20 blue candies. If a student randomly selects 2 candies from the jar without replacement, what is the probability that both candies are blue?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both candies being blue, we can use the formula for probability: P(A) = (number of successful outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes).\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. There are 100 candies in the jar (50 red + 30 green + 20 blue), so when the student selects the first candy, there are 100 possible outcomes. After the first candy is selected, there are 99 candies left in the jar, so there are 99 possible outcomes for the second candy. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for selecting 2 candies is 100 * 99 = 9900.\n\nNow, let's find the number of successful outcomes, which is when both candies are blue. There are 20 blue candies in the jar, so the probability of selecting a blue candy on the first draw is 20/100. After selecting the first blue candy, there are 19 blue candies left and 99 total candies left in the jar, so the probability of selecting a blue candy on the second draw is 19/99.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening (both candies being blue), we multiply the probabilities of each event: (20/100) * (19/99) = (20 * 19) / (100 * 99) = 380 / 9900.\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 10: 380 / 10 = 38 and 9900 / 10 = 990. So, the simplified fraction is 38/990.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both candies are blue is 38/990."
