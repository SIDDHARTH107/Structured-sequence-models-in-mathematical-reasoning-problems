    "message_1": "A company needs to optimize the number of packages they ship using two different trucks with different capacities. Truck A can carry a maximum of 10 packages and Truck B can carry a maximum of 8 packages. The company has a total of 26 packages to ship. What is the optimal combination of packages that should be loaded onto each truck to maximize the number of packages shipped?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of packages loaded onto Truck A and y be the number of packages loaded onto Truck B. We want to maximize the total number of packages shipped, which is x + y, subject to the constraints:\n\nx ≤ 10 (Truck A capacity)\ny ≤ 8 (Truck B capacity)\nx + y = 26 (Total packages)\n\nTo find the optimal combination, we can start by solving the third equation for x:\n\nx = 26 - y\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for x into the first constraint:\n\n26 - y ≤ 10\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny ≥ 16\n\nHowever, this value exceeds the capacity of Truck B, so we must use the maximum capacity of Truck B, which is 8 packages. Now, we can find the corresponding value for x:\n\nx = 26 - 8 = 18\n\nThis value exceeds the capacity of Truck A, so we must use the maximum capacity of Truck A, which is 10 packages. Therefore, the optimal combination of packages is 10 packages on Truck A and 8 packages on Truck B, for a total of 18 packages shipped. Note that this does not utilize the full 26 packages available, but it is the best possible solution given the constraints of the problem."
