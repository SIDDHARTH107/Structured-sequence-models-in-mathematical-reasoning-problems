    "message_1": "A wire of length 10 meters is stretched between two fixed points. The ends of the wire are fixed in position and the wire is initially shaped into a flat line. At time t=0, the wire is given an initial displacement of 2 cm at its center point and is then released to vibrate freely. Using the Fourier transform solve for the shape of the wire at any given time t.",
    "message_2": "To solve for the shape of the wire at any given time t, we can use the Fourier series representation of the initial displacement function and then apply the wave equation to find the time-dependent solution.\n\nLet's denote the initial displacement function as f(x), where x is the position along the wire and f(x) is the vertical displacement. Since the wire is initially flat except for the 2 cm displacement at the center, we can represent f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = { 0.02 m, if x = 5 m\n       { 0, otherwise\n\nNow, we can represent f(x) as a Fourier series:\n\nf(x) = (a_0 / 2) + Σ [a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L is the length of the wire (10 m), and a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients. Since f(x) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. To find the b_n coefficients, we can use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2 / L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)] dx, from 0 to L\n\nFor the given initial displacement function, we only need to integrate over the interval where f(x) = 0.02 m, which is at x = 5 m:\n\nb_n = (2 / 10) * ∫[0.02 * sin(n * π * x / 10)] dx, from 4.99 to 5.01 (approximately)\n\nAfter calculating the integral, we get:\n\nb_n ≈ (1 / 5) * 0.02 * [(-1)^n / n]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) ≈ Σ [(0.004 / n) * (-1)^n * sin(n * π * x / 10)]\n\nNext, we need to apply the wave equation to find the time-dependent solution. The wave equation for a vibrating string with fixed ends is:\n\n∂²y(x, t) / ∂t² = c² * ∂²y(x, t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere y(x, t) is the displacement of the wire at position x and time t, and c is the wave speed. The general solution to the wave equation can be written as:\n\ny(x, t) = Σ [A_n * cos(n * π * c * t / L) + B_n * sin(n * π * c * t / L)] * sin(n * π * x / L)\n\nSince the wire is initially at rest, all A_n coefficients are zero. The B_n coefficients can be found by matching the initial condition y(x, 0) = f(x):\n\nB_n = (0.004 / n) * (-1)^n\n\nFinally, we can write the solution for the shape of the wire at any given time t:\n\ny(x, t) ≈ Σ [(0.004 / n) * (-1)^n * sin(n * π * c * t / 10) * sin(n * π * x / 10)]\n\nThis equation describes the shape of the wire at any given time t, taking into account the initial displacement and the wave speed c."
