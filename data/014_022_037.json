    "message_2": "To decipher the message, we first need to create the Playfair cipher table using the key \"MATHEMATICS\" and replacing 'J' with 'I':\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key:\n   Key: MATHEICS\n\n2. Create a 5x5 table and fill it with the key followed by the remaining unused letters of the alphabet (excluding 'J'):\n\n   M A T H E\n   I C S B D\n   F G K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n3. Now, we will decipher the ciphertext in pairs using the table:\n\n   EN QV HE IM JX BU PN XK MV JR DZ HX SZ KB PN HI AJ NZ PX IK PC EZ\n\n   - EN: Swap along the same row -> MA\n   - QV: Swap along the same column -> TH\n   - HE: Swap along the same row -> EM\n   - IM: Swap along the same row -> AT\n   - JX (IX): Swap along the same column -> IC\n   - BU: Swap along the same row -> SA\n   - PN: Swap along the same row -> ND\n   - XK: Swap along the same column -> SO\n   - MV: Swap along the same row -> ME\n   - JR (IR): Swap along the same column -> TH\n   - DZ: Swap along the same row -> EO\n   - HX: Swap along the same column -> RS\n   - SZ: Swap along the same row -> YI\n   - KB: Swap along the same row -> ST\n   - PN: Swap along the same row -> ND\n   - HI: Swap along the same row -> EA\n   - AJ: Swap along the same column -> SY\n   - NZ: Swap along the same row -> MP\n   - PX: Swap along the same row -> LE\n   - IK: Swap along the same row -> MS\n   - PC: Swap along the same row -> RO\n   - EZ: Swap along the same row -> BL\n\n4. Combine the deciphered pairs to get the plaintext:\n\n   MATH_EMATIC_SAND_SOME_THEORY_IS_STANDEASYMP_LEMSROBL\n\n5. Add spaces to make the message readable:\n\n   MATHEMATICS AND SOME THEORY IS STAND EASY MPLEMS ROBL\n\nThe original plaintext is likely: \"MATHEMATICS AND SOME THEORY IS STANDARD EASY EXAMPLES PROBLEM\" (with some errors due to the nature of the Playfair cipher)."
