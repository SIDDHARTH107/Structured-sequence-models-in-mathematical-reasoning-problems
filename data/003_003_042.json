    "message_2": "The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1, centered at the origin of the coordinate plane. To find the value of sin(π/4), we need to determine the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle that corresponds to an angle of π/4 radians.\n\nAn angle of π/4 radians is equivalent to 45 degrees. In a right-angled isosceles triangle with angles of 45°, 45°, and 90°, the ratio of the lengths of the legs to the hypotenuse is 1:1:√2. Since the unit circle has a radius of 1, the hypotenuse of this triangle is also 1.\n\nLet's call the length of one of the legs (the y-coordinate) \"y\". Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\ny^2 + y^2 = 1^2\n2y^2 = 1\ny^2 = 1/2\ny = √(1/2)\n\nSince sin(π/4) is positive in the first quadrant, we can conclude that sin(π/4) = y = √(1/2) = √2/2."
