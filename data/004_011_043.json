    "message_1": "A cylindrical oil tank is being filled with oil at a rate of 10 cubic meters per minute. The radius of the tank is 3 meters and the height is 10 meters. How fast is the oil level rising when the oil is 5 meters deep?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. In this case, the radius is constant at 3 meters, but the height (oil level) is changing.\n\nFirst, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time (t) to find the rate of change of the volume:\n\ndV/dt = πr^2(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that the oil is being filled at a rate of 10 cubic meters per minute, so dV/dt = 10 m^3/min. We want to find the rate at which the oil level is rising (dh/dt) when the oil is 5 meters deep (h = 5 m).\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n10 = π(3)^2(dh/dt)\n\n10 = 9π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = 10 / (9π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ 0.353 m/min\n\nSo, the oil level is rising at a rate of approximately 0.353 meters per minute when the oil is 5 meters deep."
