    "message_2": "Apologies for the previous incorrect responses. Here is the correct answer:\n\nWhen gluing two tetrahedra along a shared face, we need to consider the shared vertices, edges, and faces in the Euler characteristic formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nIn this case, there are 6 vertices (4 from one tetrahedron and 2 new ones from the other tetrahedron), 9 edges (6 from one tetrahedron and 3 new ones from the other tetrahedron), and 7 faces (4 from one tetrahedron and 3 new ones from the other tetrahedron).\n\nSo, χ = 6 - 9 + 7 = 4."
