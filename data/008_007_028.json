    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P such that $P^{-1}AP = D$, we need to diagonalize matrix A. This involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues of A:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation $|A - \\lambda I| = 0$, where $\\lambda$ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\n$|A - \\lambda I| = \\begin{vmatrix} 5-\\lambda & -4 \\\\ 4 & -5-\\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = (5-\\lambda)(-5-\\lambda) - (-4)(4) = \\lambda^2 - 9$\n\nSolving for $\\lambda$, we get $\\lambda_1 = 3$ and $\\lambda_2 = -3$.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors of A:\nFor each eigenvalue, we need to find the eigenvectors by solving the equation $(A - \\lambda I)X = 0$, where X is the eigenvector.\n\nFor $\\lambda_1 = 3$:\n$(A - 3I)X = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -4 \\\\ 4 & -8 \\end{bmatrix}X = 0$\n\nWe can see that the second row is a multiple of the first row, so we only need to consider one equation: $2x_1 - 4x_2 = 0$. Let $x_2 = 1$, then $x_1 = 2$. So, the eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = 3$ is $X_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nFor $\\lambda_2 = -3$:\n$(A + 3I)X = \\begin{bmatrix} 8 & -4 \\\\ 4 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}X = 0$\n\nAgain, the second row is a multiple of the first row, so we only need to consider one equation: $8x_1 - 4x_2 = 0$. Let $x_2 = 2$, then $x_1 = 1$. So, the eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_2 = -3$ is $X_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n3. Form the matrix P and D:\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns, and the diagonal matrix D using the eigenvalues as diagonal entries.\n\n$P = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$D = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -3 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow we have found the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P such that $P^{-1}AP = D$."
