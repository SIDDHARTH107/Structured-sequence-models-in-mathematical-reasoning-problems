    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8cm, a width of 6cm, and a height of 10cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (d) is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h):\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nIn this case, l = 8cm, w = 6cm, and h = 10cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √(8² + 6² + 10²)\nd = √(64 + 36 + 100)\nd = √200\n\nNow, we can approximate the square root of 200:\n\nd ≈ 14.1\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.1 centimeters, rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter."
