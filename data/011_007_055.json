    "message_1": "A teacher wants to divide a group of 10 students into pairs to work on a project. After each project is complete, they will be combined randomly into pairs again for the next project. How many ways can the group be paired over the course of 5 projects?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the number of ways to pair the students for a single project. We can use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students (10) and k is the size of the pairs (2).\n\nFor the first pair, there are C(10, 2) ways to choose 2 students out of 10. After the first pair is chosen, there are 8 students left. For the second pair, there are C(8, 2) ways to choose 2 students out of 8. We continue this process for all 5 pairs.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pair the students for a single project is:\n\nC(10, 2) * C(8, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to pair the students over the course of 5 projects. Since the pairs are chosen randomly for each project, we can simply raise the number of ways to pair the students for a single project to the power of the number of projects (5).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pair the students over the course of 5 projects is:\n\n(C(10, 2) * C(8, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2))^5\n\nCalculating the combinations:\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\nC(8, 2) = 28\nC(6, 2) = 15\nC(4, 2) = 6\nC(2, 2) = 1\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pair the students over the course of 5 projects is:\n\n(45 * 28 * 15 * 6 * 1)^5 = (113400)^5 = 4228250625\n\nTherefore, there are 4,228,250,625 ways to pair the students over the course of 5 projects."
