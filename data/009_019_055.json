    "message_2": "To find the probability that X(t) is greater than 2 for t = 1, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). We can rewrite the SDE as:\n\ndX/X = -3 dt + 2 dW/X\n\nNow, we can apply Ito's lemma to the function f(X) = ln(X). By Ito's lemma, we have:\n\ndf(X) = (1/X) dX + (1/2X^2) (2^2) dt\n\nSubstituting the given SDE into the above equation, we get:\n\nd ln(X) = (-3 + 1/2 * 2^2) dt + 2 dW/X\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\nd ln(X) = -1 dt + 2 dW/X\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to t from 0 to 1:\n\n∫(0 to 1) d ln(X) = ∫(0 to 1) (-1 dt + 2 dW/X)\n\nln(X(1)) - ln(X(0)) = -1 + 2 ∫(0 to 1) dW/X\n\nSince X(0) = 1, ln(X(0)) = 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nln(X(1)) = -1 + 2 ∫(0 to 1) dW/X\n\nNow, let Y(t) = 2 ∫(0 to t) dW/X. Then, dY = 2 dW/X. Y(t) is a Gaussian process with mean 0 and variance ∫(0 to t) (2/X)^2 dt. Thus, X(1) is log-normally distributed with parameters:\n\nμ = -1\nσ^2 = ∫(0 to 1) (2/X)^2 dt\n\nTo find the probability that X(1) > 2, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the log-normal distribution:\n\nP(X(1) > 2) = 1 - P(X(1) ≤ 2) = 1 - Φ((ln(2) - μ)/σ)\n\nwhere Φ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.\n\nTo find σ, we need to evaluate the integral ∫(0 to 1) (2/X)^2 dt. However, since X is a function of the Wiener process, it is not straightforward to evaluate this integral. In practice, one would use numerical methods or Monte Carlo simulations to approximate the value of σ and then compute the probability using the CDF of the log-normal distribution."
