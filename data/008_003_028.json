    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the matrix A using elementary row operations, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the row echelon form of the matrix.\n\nMatrix A:\n[3 6 9]\n[2 4 6]\n[1 2 3]\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1 in the first row.\n[1 2 3]\n[2 4 6]\n[1 2 3]\n\nStep 2: Subtract the first row from the second row multiplied by 2 and from the third row to eliminate the leading 1's in the second and third rows.\n[1 2 3]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form:\n[1 2 3]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row echelon form. In this case, there is only 1 non-zero row, so the rank of matrix A is 1."
