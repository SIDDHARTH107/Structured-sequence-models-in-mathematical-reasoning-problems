    "message_2": "To find the smallest subset of X that is closed under R, we need to consider the subsets of X and the relation R.\n\nThe subsets of X are:\n- {}\n- {a}\n- {b}\n- {c}\n- {a, b}\n- {a, c}\n- {b, c}\n- {a, b, c}\n\nNow, let's consider the relation R. For a subset to be closed under R, it must contain all the elements (x, y) such that x is a subset of y. Let's list the pairs that satisfy this condition:\n\n- ({}, {})\n- ({}, {a})\n- ({}, {b})\n- ({}, {c})\n- ({}, {a, b})\n- ({}, {a, c})\n- ({}, {b, c})\n- ({}, {a, b, c})\n- ({a}, {a})\n- ({b}, {b})\n- ({c}, {c})\n- ({a}, {a, b})\n- ({a}, {a, c})\n- ({b}, {b, c})\n- ({b}, {a, b})\n- ({c}, {a, c})\n- ({c}, {b, c})\n- ({a, b}, {a, b})\n- ({a, c}, {a, c})\n- ({b, c}, {b, c})\n- ({a, b, c}, {a, b, c})\n\nThe smallest subset of X that is closed under R must contain all the pairs listed above. However, we can notice that the empty set {} is a subset of all the other subsets. Therefore, the smallest subset of X that satisfies the property of being closed under R is the set containing the empty set:\n\n{({})}"
