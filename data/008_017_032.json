    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the sparse matrix representation, we first need to represent the given system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  5  2 -3 |\n    | -4  3  2 |\n    |  1  2 -3 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  7 |\n    |  6 |\n    |  2 |\n\nNow, we need to represent the matrix A in sparse matrix representation. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, there are no zero elements in the matrix A, so the sparse representation will include all the elements.\n\nSparse representation of A:\n(row, col, value)\n(1, 1, 5) (1, 2, 2) (1, 3, -3)\n(2, 1, -4) (2, 2, 3) (2, 3, 2)\n(3, 1, 1) (3, 2, 2) (3, 3, -3)\n\nNow, we will solve the matrix equation Ax = b using Gaussian elimination or any other method.\n\n1. Add 4 times the first row to the second row and subtract the first row from the third row to eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\nA = |  5  2 -3 |\n    |  0 11 -10|\n    |  0  0  0 |\n\nb = |  7  |\n    | 34  |\n    | -5  |\n\n2. Since the third row is all zeros, we have a dependent system. We can express z as a free variable, say z = t.\n\n3. Solve for y in the second row: 11y - 10t = 34 => y = (34 + 10t) / 11\n\n4. Solve for x in the first row: 5x + 2((34 + 10t) / 11) - 3t = 7\n\n5. Simplify the equation for x:\n\n5x + (68 + 20t) / 11 - 3t = 7\n55x + 68 + 20t = 77 + 33t\n55x = 9 + 13t\nx = (9 + 13t) / 55\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = (9 + 13t) / 55\ny = (34 + 10t) / 11\nz = t\n\nwhere t is any real number."
