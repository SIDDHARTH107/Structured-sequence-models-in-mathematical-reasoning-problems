    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[  2  -1   1 |  0 ]\n[  4   1   3 |  0 ]\n[ -3  -4  -5 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n```\n[ -3  -4  -5 |  0 ]\n[  4   1   3 |  0 ]\n[  2  -1   1 |  0 ]\n```\n\n2. Multiply Row 1 by -1/3:\n```\n[  1   4/3  5/3 |  0 ]\n[  4   1   3 |  0 ]\n[  2  -1   1 |  0 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 4*Row 1, and Row 3 with Row 3 - 2*Row 1:\n```\n[  1   4/3  5/3 |  0 ]\n[  0  -5/3  -5/3 |  0 ]\n[  0  -11/3  -3/3 |  0 ]\n```\n\n4. Multiply Row 2 by -3/5:\n```\n[  1   4/3  5/3 |  0 ]\n[  0   1   1 |  0 ]\n[  0  -11/3  -3/3 |  0 ]\n```\n\n5. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - (4/3)*Row 2, and Row 3 with Row 3 + (11/3)*Row 2:\n```\n[  1   0   1/3 |  0 ]\n[  0   1   1 |  0 ]\n[  0   0   0 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can write the corresponding system of linear equations:\n\n```\nx + (1/3)z = 0\ny + z = 0\n```\n\nLet z = t, where t is a free variable. Then, we have:\n\n```\nx = -(1/3)t\ny = -t\nz = t\n```\n\nThe solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is given by:\n\n```\n(x, y, z) = t*(-1/3, -1, 1)\n```"
