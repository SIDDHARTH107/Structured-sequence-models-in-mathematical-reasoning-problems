    "message_2": "To find the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide 27 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possibility is n_3 = 1. This means that there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P of G, which is of order 3^3 = 27. Since P is the unique 3-Sylow subgroup, it is normal in G.\n\nNow, we will consider the structure of P. P is a group of order 27, which is a power of a prime (3^3). By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C_27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C_9 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9 and 3)\n3. C_3 × C_3 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nWe will now show that the third possibility does not occur. Suppose P is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3 × C_3. Then P has 8 elements of order 3 (as each non-identity element in a direct product of cyclic groups of order 3 has order 3). Let x be an element of order 3 in P. Then the centralizer of x in G, denoted by C_G(x), contains at least 9 elements (the 8 elements of order 3 in P, and the identity element). By Lagrange's theorem, the order of C_G(x) must divide the order of G, which is 27. The only possibilities are 9 or 27. If the order of C_G(x) is 27, then x is in the center of G, which means that G is abelian. But in an abelian group, the direct product of cyclic groups of order 3 cannot occur, as it would imply the existence of more than one 3-Sylow subgroup, contradicting the uniqueness of P. Therefore, the order of C_G(x) must be 9. However, this implies that there are at least 9 elements of order 3 in G, which is a contradiction since G has only 27 elements and 9 elements are of order 1. Thus, P cannot be isomorphic to C_3 × C_3 × C_3.\n\nTherefore, there are only two possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 27:\n\n1. C_27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C_9 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9 and 3)\n\nWe have shown that any group of order 27 must be isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 27 or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
