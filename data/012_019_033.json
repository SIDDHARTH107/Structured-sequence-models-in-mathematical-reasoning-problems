    "message_2": "To color the edges of graph G with the minimum number of colors so that no two adjacent edges have the same color, we can use the following coloring:\n\n```\n A --1-- B\n |       |\n2|       |2\n |       |\n C --1-- D\n```\n\nHere, we have used 2 colors (1 and 2) to color the edges of the graph. No two adjacent edges have the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of colors required is 2."
