    "message_1": "A manufacturing company is conducting an experiment to test the performance of a new product. The experiment must test for four factors, each with two levels. Using an orthogonal array, what is the minimum number of tests required to complete this experiment?",
    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is a structured set of test cases that allows for efficient testing of multiple factors at different levels. In this case, there are four factors, each with two levels. To determine the minimum number of tests required, we can use the notation L^(k^)_(n^), where L is the orthogonal array, k is the number of factors, and n is the number of levels.\n\nFor this problem, we have k = 4 factors and n = 2 levels. The smallest orthogonal array that can accommodate this design is L^(4^)_(2^), which is also known as L8 orthogonal array.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of tests required to complete this experiment is 8."
