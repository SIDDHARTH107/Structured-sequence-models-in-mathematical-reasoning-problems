    "message_1": "In a trust game, Player A is given $10 and must decide how much money to send to Player B. This amount will be tripled and Player B will then decide how much money, if any, to send back to Player A. Suppose Player A sends $4 to Player B, how much money must Player B send back to Player A in order to maximize their own total profit?",
    "message_2": "When Player A sends $4 to Player B, the amount is tripled, so Player B receives $12. To maximize their own total profit, Player B could choose not to send any money back to Player A, keeping the entire $12 for themselves. However, this might not be the best long-term strategy, as it could lead to a lack of trust and cooperation in future interactions.\n\nIf Player B wants to maintain trust and cooperation, they could send back an amount that ensures both players have equal profits. In this case, Player A started with $10 and sent $4, leaving them with $6. To make their profits equal, Player B could send back $2, giving Player A a total of $8 ($6 + $2) and leaving Player B with $10 ($12 - $2). This way, both players end up with the same profit, which might be a more sustainable strategy in the long run."
