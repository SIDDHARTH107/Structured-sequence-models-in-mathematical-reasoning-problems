    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company earns a profit of $5/unit for Product A and $8/unit for Product B. The production process requires the use of two machines: Machine X and Machine Y. Product A requires 1 hour of Machine X and 2 hours of Machine Y, whereas Product B requires 3 hours of Machine X and 2 hours of Machine Y. The company has 60 hours of Machine X and 40 hours of Machine Y available each week. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 5x + 8y\n\nThe constraints for the available hours of Machine X and Machine Y are:\n1x + 3y ≤ 60 (Machine X)\n2x + 2y ≤ 40 (Machine Y)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints. The feasible region is the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy all the constraints.\n\n1. For the Machine X constraint, we have the inequality:\nx + 3y ≤ 60\ny ≤ (60 - x) / 3\n\n2. For the Machine Y constraint, we have the inequality:\n2x + 2y ≤ 40\ny ≤ 20 - x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. We can find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1. Intersection of Machine X and Machine Y constraints:\nx + 3y = 60\n2x + 2y = 40\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 20 and y = 10.\n\n2. Intersection of Machine X constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\nx + 3y = 60\n0 + 3y = 60\ny = 20\n\n3. Intersection of Machine Y constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 2y = 40\n2x + 2(0) = 40\nx = 20\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 20), (20, 0), and (20, 10).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 8y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 20) = 5(0) + 8(20) = 0 + 160 = 160\n2. P(20, 0) = 5(20) + 8(0) = 100 + 0 = 100\n3. P(20, 10) = 5(20) + 8(10) = 100 + 80 = 180\n\nThe maximum profit is $180, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of Product A and 10 units of Product B."
