    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we need to have the actual dataset containing the heights and weights of the 100 people, as well as their gender and age information. Since the dataset is not provided, we cannot perform the analysis directly. However, I can explain the process of how to perform discriminant analysis and how to interpret the results.\n\nDiscriminant analysis is a statistical technique used to classify observations into two or more groups based on predictor variables. In this case, we have two predictor variables (height and weight) and two classification variables (gender and age). We will perform two separate discriminant analyses: one for predicting gender and one for predicting age.\n\nHere are the steps to perform discriminant analysis:\n\n1. Divide the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to build the discriminant model, and the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.\n\n2. For each classification variable (gender and age), calculate the mean height and weight for each group. For example, calculate the mean height and weight for males and females, and for different age groups (e.g., under 30, 30-50, over 50).\n\n3. Calculate the within-group covariance matrix and the between-group covariance matrix for each classification variable.\n\n4. Perform the actual discriminant analysis by finding the linear combination of predictor variables (height and weight) that maximizes the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance. This will give you the discriminant function coefficients for each classification variable.\n\n5. Use the discriminant function coefficients to classify the observations in the test set. Calculate the classification accuracy (the proportion of correctly classified observations) for each classification variable.\n\n6. Compare the classification accuracies for gender and age. The higher the classification accuracy, the more useful the predictor variables (height and weight) are for predicting that classification variable.\n\nIn summary, without the actual dataset, we cannot perform the discriminant analysis and determine whether height and weight are more useful for predicting gender or age. However, by following the steps outlined above, you can perform the analysis on your dataset and make the comparison."
