    "message_1": "Consider a stochastic optimization problem of maximizing the profit from selling apples at a local market. The profit earned from selling each apple follows a normal distribution with a mean of $0.50 and a standard deviation of $0.10. Each apple costs $0.25 to produce. If the vendor has 200 apples, what is the optimal number of apples to sell in order to maximize the expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the expected profit, we need to find the optimal number of apples to sell. Let's denote the number of apples to sell as x. The expected profit per apple is the difference between the mean profit and the cost of producing each apple:\n\nExpected profit per apple = Mean profit - Cost = $0.50 - $0.25 = $0.25\n\nSince the profit per apple follows a normal distribution, the expected profit from selling x apples is:\n\nExpected profit = x * Expected profit per apple = x * $0.25\n\nNow, we want to maximize the expected profit, given that the vendor has 200 apples. The maximum profit will be achieved when the vendor sells all 200 apples:\n\nOptimal number of apples to sell = 200\n\nSo, the vendor should sell all 200 apples to maximize the expected profit. The expected profit in this case would be:\n\nExpected profit = 200 * $0.25 = $50"
