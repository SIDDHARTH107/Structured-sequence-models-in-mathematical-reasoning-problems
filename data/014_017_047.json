B\n2. K\n3. Q\n4. W\n5. X",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will compare the given character frequencies with the typical English letter frequencies. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D.\n\nHere are the given character frequencies sorted in descending order:\n\nE: 28, T: 18, R: 17, C: 16, S: 14, M: 14, A: 12, N: 10, O: 9, I: 9, F: 9, G: 11, H: 6, L: 6, U: 6, D: 5, B: 7, V: 2, Y: 2, K: 1, Z: 1, J: 0, Q: 0, W: 0, X: 0.\n\nNow, let's match the encrypted letters with the most likely corresponding English letters based on their frequencies:\n\n1. B: The frequency of B is 7, which is closest to the frequency of D in English. So, B most likely corresponds to D.\n2. K: The frequency of K is 1, which is closest to the frequency of Z in English. So, K most likely corresponds to Z.\n3. Q: The frequency of Q is 0, which is closest to the frequency of J in English. So, Q most likely corresponds to J.\n4. W: The frequency of W is 0, which is closest to the frequency of Q in English. So, W most likely corresponds to Q.\n5. X: The frequency of X is 0, which is closest to the frequency of X in English. So, X most likely corresponds to X."
