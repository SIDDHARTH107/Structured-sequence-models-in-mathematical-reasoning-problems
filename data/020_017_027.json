    "message_2": "To find the values of x at which the particle comes to rest, we need to find the points where the force acting on the particle is zero. The force F(x) acting on the particle is the negative derivative of the potential energy function V(x) with respect to x:\n\nF(x) = -dV(x)/dx\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of V(x):\n\ndV(x)/dx = d(1/4x^4 - 1/2x^2 + 4x)/dx = x^3 - x + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which F(x) = 0:\n\n0 = - (x^3 - x + 4)\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if there is a rational root of the form p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, 4) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1). Thus, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, and ±4.\n\nBy trying these values, we find that x = 1 is a root:\n\n0 = -((1)^3 - (1) + 4) = - (1 - 1 + 4) = -4\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 - x + 4) / (x - 1) = x^2 + x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 4 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -4:\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1)\nx = (-1 ± √17) / 2\n\nSo, the values of x at which the particle comes to rest are x = 1, x = (-1 + √17) / 2, and x = (-1 - √17) / 2."
