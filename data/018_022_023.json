    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of the symmetric difference with respect to A. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted by A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × (A ∆ B) = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ (A ∆ B)}\n\nA × (A ∆ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of the symmetric difference of A and B with respect to A is {(1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)}."
