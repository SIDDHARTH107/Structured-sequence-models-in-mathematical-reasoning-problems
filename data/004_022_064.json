    "message_1": "A rectangular plot of land has a river running along one of its sides. The landowner wants to fence three sides of the plot using the minimum amount of fencing material possible, while also making sure that the enclosed area is 1000 square meters. If the length of the side of the plot parallel to the river is twice that of the width, what are the dimensions of the plot that minimize the amount of fencing material used?",
    "message_2": "Let the width of the plot be x meters and the length be 2x meters (since the length is twice the width). The area of the plot is given by:\n\nArea = length × width\n1000 = 2x × x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx^2 = 500\nx = √500\n\nNow, we need to minimize the amount of fencing material used. The fencing will be used for the width, length, and the other width side. So, the total fencing material used is:\n\nFencing = x + 2x + x\nFencing = 4x\n\nSubstitute the value of x we found earlier:\n\nFencing = 4√500\n\nNow, we have the dimensions of the plot:\n\nWidth = √500 meters\nLength = 2√500 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the plot that minimize the amount of fencing material used are approximately:\n\nWidth ≈ 22.36 meters\nLength ≈ 44.72 meters"
