    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 8, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. Every group of order 8 is either abelian or non-abelian.\n2. If a group of order 8 is abelian, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, C4 × C2, or C2 × C2 × C2.\n3. If a group of order 8 is non-abelian, it must be isomorphic to either the quaternion group Q8 or the dihedral group D4.\n\nNow, let's prove that every group of order 8 belongs to one of these isomorphism classes:\n\n1. If a group G of order 8 is abelian, then by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, C4 × C2, or C2 × C2 × C2.\n\n2. If a group G of order 8 is non-abelian, then it must have an element of order 4. Let x be an element of order 4 in G. Then, the subgroup H generated by x has order 4 and index 2, so it must be a normal subgroup of G. Now, let y be an element of G not in H. Then, G is generated by x and y, and we have the following possibilities:\n\n   a. If y^2 = 1, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, as the relations between x and y satisfy the presentation of D4: ⟨x, y | x^4 = y^2 = 1, yx = x^3y⟩.\n   \n   b. If y^2 = x^2, then G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8, as the relations between x and y satisfy the presentation of Q8: ⟨x, y | x^4 = 1, x^2 = y^2, yx = x^3y⟩.\n\nThus, every group of order 8 belongs to one of these isomorphism classes: C8, C4 × C2, C2 × C2 × C2, Q8, or D4.\n\nNow, let's explicitly identify the groups in each class:\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8, generated by an element a with a^8 = 1.\n2. C4 × C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2, generated by elements a and b with a^4 = b^2 = 1 and ab = ba.\n3. C2 × C2 × C2: The direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, generated by elements a, b, and c with a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1 and ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb.\n4. Q8: The quaternion group, generated by elements a and b with a^4 = 1, a^2 = b^2, and ab = b^3a.\n5. D4: The dihedral group of order 8, generated by elements a and b with a^4 = b^2 = 1 and ab = b^3a.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 5 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 8: C8, C4 × C2, C2 × C2 × C2, Q8, and D4."
