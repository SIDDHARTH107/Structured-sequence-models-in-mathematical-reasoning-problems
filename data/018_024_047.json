    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B, which is the symmetric difference between A and B. This means we will find the elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA △ B = {2, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B. Since no universal set is given, we will consider the union of A and B as the universal set. Therefore, the universal set U = {2, 4, 6, 8}.\n\nAc = U - A = {4, 8}\nBc = U - B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, let's find Ac △ Bc, which is the symmetric difference between Ac and Bc.\n\nAc △ Bc = {2, 8}\n\nNow, we will find the union of (A △ B) and (Ac △ Bc):\n\n(A △ B) ∪ (Ac △ Bc) = {2, 8} ∪ {2, 8} = {2, 8}\n\nThe set {2, 8} is equal to (A △ B) ∪ (Ac △ Bc). To find a set that is not equal to this, we can choose any set that does not have the same elements. For example, the set {1, 3, 5} is not equal to (A △ B) ∪ (Ac △ Bc)."
