    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Let's assume that the universal set U contains all the integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of U and A, we can find the elements that are not in A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, let's prove that the intersection of A and A' is the empty set. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nSince A contains all even integers from 2 to 10, and A' contains all odd integers from 1 to 9, there are no common elements between A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of A and A' is the empty set:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis proves that the intersection of A and A' is the empty set."
