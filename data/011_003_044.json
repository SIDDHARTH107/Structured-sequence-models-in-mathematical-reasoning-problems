    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider two steps: choosing 5 books out of 10 and then arranging them on the shelf.\n\nFirst, we use Pascal's Triangle to find the number of ways to choose 5 books out of 10. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The nth row of Pascal's Triangle represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (x+y)^n. In our case, we want to find the number of combinations of choosing 5 books out of 10, which can be represented as 10 choose 5 or 10C5.\n\nPascal's Triangle looks like this:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n```\n\nWe can find 10C5 in the 11th row (since the first row is considered the 0th row) and the 5th element (0-indexed). In this case, 10C5 = 252. So, there are 252 ways to choose 5 books out of 10.\n\nNext, we need to arrange the chosen 5 books on the shelf. Since there are 5 books, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them. 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to choose and arrange the 5 books on the shelf, we multiply the number of ways to choose the books (252) by the number of ways to arrange them (120).\n\nTotal ways = 252 × 120 = 30,240\n\nSo, there are 30,240 ways to choose and arrange 5 different books on a shelf with 10 available spaces."
