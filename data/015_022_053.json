    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a time-delay differential equation that models physiological control systems. It is given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = a * x(t - τ) / (1 + x(t - τ)^c) - b * x(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the state variable, a, b, and c are positive constants, and τ is the time delay.\n\nTo find the equilibrium value, we need to find the value of x(t) when dx(t)/dt = 0. In this case, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = a * x(t - τ) / (1 + x(t - τ)^c) - b * x(t)\n\nLet's denote the equilibrium value as x_eq. Since the system is at equilibrium, x(t) = x(t - τ) = x_eq. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n0 = a * x_eq / (1 + x_eq^c) - b * x_eq\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for a, b, and c:\n\n0 = 0.2 * x_eq / (1 + x_eq^10) - 0.1 * x_eq\n\nTo solve for x_eq, we can use numerical methods, such as the bisection method or Newton's method. However, an exact analytical solution is not possible for this equation. Using a numerical solver, we find that the approximate equilibrium value is:\n\nx_eq ≈ 1.2267\n\nSo, the approximate equilibrium value for the Mackey-Glass equation with the given parameters is x_eq ≈ 1.2267."
