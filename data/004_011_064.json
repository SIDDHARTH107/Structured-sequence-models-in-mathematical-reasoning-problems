At a height of 50 feet above the ground, a person on the ground is walking away from the balloon at a rate of 3 ft/sec. How fast is the distance between the person and the balloon increasing 5 seconds later? (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the height of the balloon (y), the horizontal distance between the person and the balloon (x), and the distance between the person and the balloon (z).\n\ny^2 + x^2 = z^2\n\nWe are given the rates of change of y and x with respect to time (t). We have dy/dt = 5 ft/sec (the rate the balloon is rising) and dx/dt = 3 ft/sec (the rate the person is walking away from the balloon). We want to find dz/dt (the rate the distance between the person and the balloon is increasing) 5 seconds later.\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of y and x at t = 5 seconds. Since the balloon is rising at a rate of 5 ft/sec, after 5 seconds, it will have risen an additional 5 * 5 = 25 feet. So, y = 50 + 25 = 75 feet.\n\nSimilarly, the person is walking away at a rate of 3 ft/sec, so after 5 seconds, they will have walked 3 * 5 = 15 feet away. Since they start at the point right below the balloon, x = 15 feet.\n\nNow, we can find the value of z at t = 5 seconds using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n75^2 + 15^2 = z^2\n5625 + 225 = z^2\n5850 = z^2\nz = sqrt(5850) ≈ 76.42 feet\n\nNext, we need to differentiate the Pythagorean equation with respect to time:\n\n2y(dy/dt) + 2x(dx/dt) = 2z(dz/dt)\n\nNow, plug in the values of y, x, z, dy/dt, and dx/dt:\n\n2(75)(5) + 2(15)(3) = 2(76.42)(dz/dt)\n\nSolve for dz/dt:\n\n750 + 90 = 152.84(dz/dt)\n840 = 152.84(dz/dt)\ndz/dt ≈ 5.49 ft/sec\n\nSo, the distance between the person and the balloon is increasing at a rate of approximately 5.49 ft/sec 5 seconds later."
