    "message_2": "To cover all possible combinations of four factors (A, B, C, D) with four levels per factor, we need to calculate the total number of combinations using the formula:\n\nTotal combinations = (Number of levels)^(Number of factors)\n\nIn this case, there are four levels per factor and four factors, so the total number of combinations is:\n\nTotal combinations = 4^4 = 256\n\nTherefore, 256 test runs are needed to cover all possible combinations."
