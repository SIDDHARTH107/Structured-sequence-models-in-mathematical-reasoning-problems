    "message_1": "Using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, if Alice's public key is 5 and her private key is 23, while Bob's public key is 8 and his private key is 19, what is the shared secret key that they can use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Alice computes the shared secret key: (Bob's public key ^ Alice's private key) mod p\n2. Bob computes the shared secret key: (Alice's public key ^ Bob's private key) mod p\n\nHowever, we need the prime number (p) and the primitive root (g) used in the key exchange. These values are usually agreed upon by both parties beforehand. Please provide the values of p and g to proceed with the calculation."
