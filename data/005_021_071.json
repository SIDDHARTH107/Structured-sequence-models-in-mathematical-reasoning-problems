Using bootstrapping, you would like to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the mean of the population. \n\nPerform a bootstrap analysis on the sample data, and find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean.",
    "message_2": "To perform a bootstrap analysis and find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the sample data of 50 observations. Since the actual data is not provided, I will assume that you have the data in a list or an array.\n\n2. Resample the data with replacement to create a new bootstrap sample of the same size (50 observations). This means that you will randomly select 50 observations from the original sample, allowing for the same observation to be selected multiple times.\n\n3. Calculate the mean of the bootstrap sample.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a large number of times, typically 1000 or more, to create a distribution of bootstrap sample means.\n\n5. Sort the bootstrap sample means in ascending order.\n\n6. Calculate the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted bootstrap sample means. These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the population mean.\n\nHere's a Python code example to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming you have the sample data in a list or array called 'data'\ndata = np.array([your_sample_data_here])\n\n# Number of bootstrap samples\nn_bootstrap_samples = 1000\n\n# Generate bootstrap sample means\nbootstrap_sample_means = []\nfor _ in range(n_bootstrap_samples):\n    bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(data, size=len(data), replace=True)\n    bootstrap_sample_means.append(np.mean(bootstrap_sample))\n\n# Calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles\nlower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_sample_means, 2.5)\nupper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_sample_means, 97.5)\n\n# Print the 95% confidence interval\nprint(f\"The 95% confidence interval for the population mean is ({lower_bound}, {upper_bound})\")\n```\n\nReplace `your_sample_data_here` with your actual data, and run the code to obtain the 95% confidence interval for the population mean."
