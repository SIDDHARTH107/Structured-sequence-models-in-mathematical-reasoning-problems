    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to take the exterior derivative of each term in the given differential form.\n\nFirst, let's consider the term $e^x(dx \\wedge dy)$. Since $e^x$ is a scalar function, we can take its exterior derivative directly:\n\n$d(e^x) = e^x dx$.\n\nNow, we need to take the exterior derivative of $(dx \\wedge dy)$:\n\n$d(dx \\wedge dy) = 0$.\n\nThis is because the exterior derivative of a 2-form in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is always 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the term $\\sin(y)dz$. Taking the exterior derivative of the scalar function $\\sin(y)$:\n\n$d(\\sin(y)) = \\cos(y) dy$.\n\nNow, we need to take the exterior derivative of $dz$:\n\n$d(dz) = 0$.\n\nThis is because the exterior derivative of a 1-form is always 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ by taking the wedge product of the exterior derivatives of the scalar functions and the differential forms:\n\n$d\\omega = d(e^x) \\wedge (dx \\wedge dy) + d(\\sin(y)) \\wedge dz$.\n\nSubstituting the calculated exterior derivatives:\n\n$d\\omega = (e^x dx) \\wedge (dx \\wedge dy) + (\\cos(y) dy) \\wedge dz$.\n\nUsing the properties of the wedge product, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$d\\omega = e^x(dx \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) + \\cos(y) dy \\wedge dz$.\n\nSince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, the first term vanishes:\n\n$d\\omega = \\cos(y) dy \\wedge dz$.\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the given differential form is:\n\n$d\\omega = \\cos(y) dy \\wedge dz$."
