    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, which means that with each iteration, the pattern is repeated at a smaller scale. In the case of the Vicsek fractal, the side length of the smaller squares in the next iteration is 1/3 of the side length of the squares in the previous iteration.\n\nFor the first iteration, the total length of the fractal is simply the perimeter of the initial square, which is 4 times the side length:\n\nLength_1 = 4 * 3 cm = 12 cm\n\nFor the second iteration, there are 5 smaller squares, each with a side length of 1 cm (3 cm / 3). The total length of the fractal for this iteration is:\n\nLength_2 = 5 * 4 * 1 cm = 20 cm\n\nFor the third iteration, there are 5^2 = 25 smaller squares, each with a side length of 1/3 cm (1 cm / 3). The total length of the fractal for this iteration is:\n\nLength_3 = 25 * 4 * (1/3) cm = 100/3 cm\n\nFor the fourth iteration, there are 5^3 = 125 smaller squares, each with a side length of 1/9 cm (1/3 cm / 3). The total length of the fractal for this iteration is:\n\nLength_4 = 125 * 4 * (1/9) cm = 500/9 cm\n\nTo find the total length of the fractal, including all iterations, we sum the lengths of each iteration:\n\nTotal_length = Length_1 + Length_2 + Length_3 + Length_4\nTotal_length = 12 cm + 20 cm + 100/3 cm + 500/9 cm\n\nTo sum the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 9:\n\nTotal_length = 108/9 cm + 180/9 cm + 300/9 cm + 500/9 cm\nTotal_length = (108 + 180 + 300 + 500) / 9 cm\nTotal_length = 1088/9 cm\n\nSo, the total length of the Vicsek fractal after 4 iterations is 1088/9 cm, or approximately 120.89 cm."
