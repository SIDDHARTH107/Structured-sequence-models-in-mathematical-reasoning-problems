    "message_1": "Suppose we want to encrypt a plaintext of 64 bits using the Feistel cipher structure with 16 rounds, where the key used is 128 bits. How many subkeys of 64 bits each will be generated during the key expansion phase?",
    "message_2": "In the Feistel cipher structure, one subkey is generated for each round of the encryption process. Since there are 16 rounds in this case, 16 subkeys of 64 bits each will be generated during the key expansion phase."
