    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the complement of each set and calculate the symmetric difference of these complements. Show that the symmetric difference of the original sets is not distributive over complement by comparing the two results.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of each set. The complement of a set A is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. We need to define the universal set U. Let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nA' = U - A = {5, 4, 3}\nB' = U - B = {5, 1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complements A' and B'.\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B')\n\nA' ∪ B' = {5, 4, 3, 1, 2}\nA' ∩ B' = {5}\nA' ∆ B' = {4, 3, 1, 2}\n\nNow, let's compare the symmetric difference of the original sets (A ∆ B) and the symmetric difference of their complements (A' ∆ B').\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\nA' ∆ B' = {4, 3, 1, 2}\n\nSince A ∆ B ≠ A' ∆ B', we can conclude that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
