    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails using Monte Carlo simulation, we will perform a large number of experiments (coin flips) and calculate the ratio of successful outcomes (50 heads and 50 tails) to the total number of experiments. \n\nLet's perform the simulation with 1,000,000 experiments:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef coin_flip():\n    return random.choice([\"H\", \"T\"])\n\ndef experiment():\n    heads = 0\n    tails = 0\n    for _ in range(100):\n        flip = coin_flip()\n        if flip == \"H\":\n            heads += 1\n        else:\n            tails += 1\n    return heads == 50 and tails == 50\n\nnum_experiments = 1000000\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\nfor _ in range(num_experiments):\n    if experiment():\n        successful_outcomes += 1\n\nprobability = successful_outcomes / num_experiments\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, we can calculate the probability:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Estimated probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails:\", probability)\n```\n\nThe estimated probability will be close to the actual probability, which can be calculated using the binomial formula:\n\nActual probability = (combinations of 50 heads in 100 flips) / (total possible outcomes)\nActual probability = C(100, 50) / 2^100\nActual probability â‰ˆ 0.079589\n\nKeep in mind that the Monte Carlo simulation result may not be exactly the same as the actual probability, but it should be close. The more experiments you perform, the closer the estimate will be to the actual probability."
