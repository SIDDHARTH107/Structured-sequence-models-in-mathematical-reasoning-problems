    "message_1": "A factory wants to produce a product using two machines. Machine A costs $600 per hour to operate and can produce 8 units per hour. Machine B costs $400 per hour to operate and can produce 6 units per hour. The factory wants to produce 200 units in minimum time and at minimum cost. Find the optimal amount of time (in hours) that each machine should be used to produce the required 200 units.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of hours Machine A operates and y be the number of hours Machine B operates. We have two equations:\n\n1) 8x + 6y = 200 (since we want to produce 200 units)\n2) We want to minimize the cost, so we need to minimize the function C(x, y) = 600x + 400y.\n\nFirst, we will solve equation (1) for y:\n\ny = (200 - 8x) / 6\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the cost function:\n\nC(x) = 600x + 400((200 - 8x) / 6)\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC(x) = 600x + (400/6)(200 - 8x)\nC(x) = 600x + (200/3)(200 - 8x)\n\nNow, we will find the critical points by taking the derivative of C(x) with respect to x and setting it to 0:\n\nC'(x) = 600 - (200/3)(8)\nC'(x) = 600 - (1600/3)\n\nSet C'(x) = 0:\n\n600 - (1600/3) = 0\n1800 - 1600 = 1600/3\n200 = (1600/3)\nx = 3\n\nNow, substitute x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (200 - 8(3)) / 6\ny = (200 - 24) / 6\ny = 176 / 6\ny = 29.3333\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an hour, we will round y up to 30 hours. Now, we will adjust x accordingly:\n\n8x + 6(30) = 200\n8x + 180 = 200\n8x = 20\nx = 2.5\n\nSo, the optimal amount of time is 2.5 hours for Machine A and 30 hours for Machine B to produce the required 200 units."
