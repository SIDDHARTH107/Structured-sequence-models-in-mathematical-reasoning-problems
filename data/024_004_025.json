    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature, we first need to find the principal curvatures H1 and H2. We can do this by finding the first and second fundamental forms of the surface and then using the formula:\n\nH1 + H2 = (eG - 2fF + gE) / 2(EG - F^2)\n\nwhere E, F, G are coefficients of the first fundamental form, and e, f, g are coefficients of the second fundamental form.\n\nFirst, let's find the first fundamental form. We need to find the tangent vectors of the surface:\n\n∂S/∂x = (1, 0, 3x^2) = (1, 0, 3)\n∂S/∂y = (0, 1, 3y^2) = (0, 1, 3)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = ∂S/∂x • ∂S/∂x = (1, 0, 3) • (1, 0, 3) = 1 + 9 = 10\nF = ∂S/∂x • ∂S/∂y = (1, 0, 3) • (0, 1, 3) = 0 + 0 + 9 = 9\nG = ∂S/∂y • ∂S/∂y = (0, 1, 3) • (0, 1, 3) = 0 + 1 + 9 = 10\n\nNext, let's find the second fundamental form. We need to find the second derivatives of the surface:\n\n∂²S/∂x² = (0, 0, 6x) = (0, 0, -6)\n∂²S/∂x∂y = (0, 0, 0)\n∂²S/∂y² = (0, 0, 6y) = (0, 0, 6)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\ne = ∂²S/∂x² • N = (0, 0, -6) • (1, 0, 3) = 0 + 0 - 18 = -18\nf = ∂²S/∂x∂y • N = (0, 0, 0) • (1, 0, 3) = 0\ng = ∂²S/∂y² • N = (0, 0, 6) • (1, 0, 3) = 0 + 0 + 18 = 18\n\nNow we can find the mean curvature using the formula:\n\nK = (eG - 2fF + gE) / 2(EG - F^2) = (-18*10 - 2*0*9 + 18*10) / 2(10*10 - 9*9) = (0) / 2(100 - 81) = 0 / 38 = 0\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface S at the point (-1, 1, -2) is 0."
