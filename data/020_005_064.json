    "message_1": "An appliance manufacturer produces two types of refrigerators: Model A and Model B. Each Model A requires 3 hours of assembly time, 4 hours of painting time, and yields a profit of $900. Each Model B requires 4 hours of assembly time, 3 hours of painting time, and yields a profit of $800. The assembly department has 300 hours available, while the painting department has 320 hours available. How many of each type of refrigerator should the manufacturer produce in order to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Model A refrigerators and y be the number of Model B refrigerators.\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\nP = 900x + 800y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n3x + 4y ≤ 300 (assembly time constraint)\n4x + 3y ≤ 320 (painting time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 4y ≤ 300\ny ≤ (300 - 3x) / 4\n\n2. 4x + 3y ≤ 320\ny ≤ (320 - 4x) / 3\n\nPlot these inequalities on a graph, along with x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 80), (60, 40), and (100, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P = 900x + 800y at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 900(0) + 800(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 80) = 900(0) + 800(80) = $64,000\n3. P(60, 40) = 900(60) + 800(40) = $74,000\n4. P(100, 0) = 900(100) + 800(0) = $90,000\n\nThe maximum profit of $90,000 is achieved when the manufacturer produces 100 Model A refrigerators and 0 Model B refrigerators."
