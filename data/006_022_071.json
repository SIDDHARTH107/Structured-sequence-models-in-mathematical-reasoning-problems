    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student is a girl, we need to determine the number of girls in the school and divide that by the total number of students.\n\nThere are 200 students in the school, and 60% of them are girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students by the percentage of girls:\n\n200 students * 0.60 (60%) = 120 girls\n\nNow, we can find the probability of selecting a girl by dividing the number of girls by the total number of students:\n\nProbability = (Number of girls) / (Total number of students)\nProbability = 120 girls / 200 students\nProbability = 0.60 or 60%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student is a girl is 60%."
