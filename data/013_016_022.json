    "message_1": "Here is a question for a math student to solve on the topic of Moral Hazard in Game Theory:\n\nAssume that two individuals are sharing the cost of an expensive project. The total cost of the project is $200 and both individuals have to contribute equally. However, there is a chance that one of the individuals (let's call him person A) may shirk his responsibilities and not contribute his fair share. The probability that person A will do so is 0.5. \n\nPerson B knows that person A might shirk his responsibilities, and has the option to take out insurance against this possibility. If person B takes out insurance, he will have to pay an additional $50, but if person A shirks his responsibilities, the insurance will cover the full $100 that person A should have contributed.\n\nWhat should person B do? Should he take out insurance, or not? Calculate the expected cost for person B in each case and advise what he should do.",
    "message_2": "To determine the best course of action for person B, we need to calculate the expected cost in both scenarios: with insurance and without insurance.\n\nScenario 1: Without insurance\nIf person A does not shirk his responsibilities, both individuals will contribute $100 each. If person A shirks his responsibilities, person B will have to cover the full $200 cost. The probability of person A shirking is 0.5, so we can calculate the expected cost for person B as follows:\n\nExpected cost without insurance = (0.5 * $100) + (0.5 * $200) = $50 + $100 = $150\n\nScenario 2: With insurance\nIf person B takes out insurance, he will pay an additional $50. If person A does not shirk his responsibilities, person B will pay $100 (his share) plus the $50 insurance cost. If person A shirks his responsibilities, person B will pay $100 (his share) plus the $50 insurance cost, but the insurance will cover the $100 that person A should have contributed. In both cases, person B will pay a total of $150.\n\nExpected cost with insurance = $150\n\nComparing the expected costs:\nWithout insurance: $150\nWith insurance: $150\n\nIn this case, the expected costs for person B are the same whether he takes out insurance or not. Therefore, it does not matter whether person B takes out insurance or not, as the expected cost will be the same in both scenarios."
