    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given first-order differential equation, we need to integrate both sides with respect to x.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ndy/dx = 2x + 3\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\ndy = (2x + 3) dx\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫ dy = ∫ (2x + 3) dx\n\ny = x^2 + 3x + C\n\nHere, y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, and C is the constant of integration. This is the general solution of the given differential equation."
