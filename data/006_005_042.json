    "message_1": "A company has analyzed its sales data and found that the probability of making a sale in a given hour is 0.4. What is the probability that the company will make at least two sales in a three-hour period?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of making at least two sales in a three-hour period, we can use the complementary probability rule. We will first find the probability of making less than two sales (0 or 1 sale) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's consider the different scenarios:\n\n1. No sales in three hours: The probability of not making a sale in a given hour is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, the probability of not making a sale in all three hours is (0.6)^3 = 0.216.\n\n2. One sale in three hours: There are three possible ways this can happen - the sale is made in the first, second, or third hour. The probability of making a sale in a given hour is 0.4, and not making a sale is 0.6. So, the probability of making one sale in three hours is 3 * (0.4 * 0.6^2) = 3 * 0.144 = 0.432.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 2 sales) = 1 - P(0 sales) - P(1 sale) = 1 - 0.216 - 0.432 = 0.352.\n\nSo, the probability of making at least two sales in a three-hour period is 0.352."
