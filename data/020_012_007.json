The company wants to maximize its profit by producing and selling the products. Each unit of Product A requires 2 labor hours and 1 machine hour to produce, and earns a profit of $50. Each unit of Product B requires 1 labor hour and 3 machine hours to produce, and earns a profit of $70. The company has 100 labor hours and 120 machine hours available per day. How many units of Product A and Product B should the company produce per day to maximize its profit? What is the maximum profit that the company can earn per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 100 (labor hours constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 120 (machine hours constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 50x + 70y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. Labor hours constraint: y ≤ -2x + 100\n2. Machine hours constraint: y ≤ (-1/3)x + 40\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities, which forms a polygon with the following vertices:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 40)\nC(30, 30)\nD(50, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 50(0) + 70(0) = $0\nP(B) = 50(0) + 70(40) = $2,800\nP(C) = 50(30) + 70(30) = $3,600\nP(D) = 50(50) + 70(0) = $2,500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, where the company produces 30 units of Product A and 30 units of Product B. The maximum profit is $3,600 per day."
