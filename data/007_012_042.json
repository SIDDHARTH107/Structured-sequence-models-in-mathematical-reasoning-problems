    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In this case, the modulus is 23, which is already a prime number. So, we need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the theorem for p = 23.\n\nAccording to Wilson's theorem, we need to find (23-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 23). \n\nCalculating (23-1)!:\n\n(22)! = 22 × 21 × 20 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 1,124,000,727,777,607,680,000\n\nNow, we need to check if (22)! ≡ -1 (mod 23):\n\n1,124,000,727,777,607,680,000 ≡ -1 (mod 23)\n\nUsing modular arithmetic, we can simplify this expression:\n\n(22)! % 23 = 1,124,000,727,777,607,680,000 % 23 = 0\n\nSince (22)! % 23 = 0, (22)! ≡ -1 (mod 23) is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem for modulus 23 is 22."
