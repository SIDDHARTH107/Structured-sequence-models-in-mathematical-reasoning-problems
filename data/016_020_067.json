    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Sierpinski pyramid or Tetrix, is a fractal created by recursively subdividing an equilateral tetrahedron into four smaller equilateral tetrahedra. \n\nFor a Sierpinski tetrahedron with 4 iterations, we can calculate the total number of individual equilateral triangles as follows:\n\nIteration 0: 1 tetrahedron (base) = 4 triangles\nIteration 1: 4 tetrahedra = 4 * 4 = 16 triangles\nIteration 2: 16 tetrahedra = 16 * 4 = 64 triangles\nIteration 3: 64 tetrahedra = 64 * 4 = 256 triangles\n\nNow, add the number of triangles from each iteration:\n\n4 (iteration 0) + 16 (iteration 1) + 64 (iteration 2) + 256 (iteration 3) = 340 triangles\n\nSo, a Sierpinski tetrahedron with 4 iterations requires a total of 340 individual equilateral triangles."
