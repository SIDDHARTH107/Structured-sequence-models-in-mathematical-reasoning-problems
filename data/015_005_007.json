    "message_1": "What is the value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler System?\n\nNote: The maximum Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the rate of separation of nearby trajectories in a dynamical system, which indicates whether the system is chaotic or not.",
    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a set of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe a continuous-time dynamical system. It is defined as follows:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nHere, a, b, and c are parameters that control the behavior of the system.\n\nThe maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) of the Rössler system depends on the values of these parameters. In general, the MLE cannot be calculated analytically, and numerical methods must be used to approximate its value.\n\nFor certain parameter values, the Rössler system exhibits chaotic behavior. For example, when a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7, the system is known to be chaotic. In this case, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is approximately λ1 ≈ 0.07.\n\nHowever, without specific parameter values, it is not possible to provide a single value for the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler system."
