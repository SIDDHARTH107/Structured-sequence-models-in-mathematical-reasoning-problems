    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is used to find the optimal solution for various optimization problems. Here, we will apply the HS algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 in the range [0, 5].\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Harmony Memory Size (HMS): 5\n- Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): 0.8\n- Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): 0.3\n- Number of iterations: 100\n\nStep 2: Initialize the Harmony Memory (HM)\nGenerate 5 random solutions (harmonies) within the range [0, 5] and store them in the HM.\n\nStep 3: Improvise a new harmony\nFor each iteration, create a new harmony by following these steps:\n1. For each decision variable (x in this case), select a value from the HM with a probability of HMCR or generate a random value within the range [0, 5] with a probability of 1-HMCR.\n2. If the value is selected from the HM, apply pitch adjustment with a probability of PAR. This means adding a random value within a specified bandwidth to the selected value.\n3. Evaluate the new harmony using the objective function f(x).\n\nStep 4: Update the Harmony Memory\nIf the new harmony is better than the worst harmony in the HM, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\nStep 5: Check the stopping criterion\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 for the specified number of iterations (100 in this case).\n\nStep 6: Return the best solution\nAfter completing the iterations, return the harmony with the lowest objective function value from the HM.\n\nBy applying the Harmony Search algorithm to the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 in the range [0, 5], we can find the minimum value of the function. However, it is important to note that the HS algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the results may vary depending on the random values generated during the search process.\n\nAlternatively, you can also find the minimum value of the function analytically by taking the derivative of the function and setting it to zero. The minimum value occurs at x = 2, and the minimum value of the function is f(2) = 2^2 - 4*2 + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1."
