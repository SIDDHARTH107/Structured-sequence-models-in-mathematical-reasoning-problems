    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of the two surfaces:\n\n1. $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 16$\n2. $x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 0$\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n$(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - (x^2 - y^2 - z^2) = 16 - 0$\n\n$2y^2 + 2z^2 = 16$\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n$y^2 + z^2 = 8$\n\nNow, we have the equation of the intersection curve of the two surfaces:\n\n3. $y^2 + z^2 = 8$\n\nNext, we need to find the normal vector to the plane that is perpendicular to the plane $y = 3x$. The normal vector of the plane $y = 3x$ is $\\mathbf{n} = (3, -1, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vector to the intersection curve (3) at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$. We can parameterize the curve by introducing a parameter $t$:\n\n$y = 2\\cos{t}$\n$z = 2\\sin{t}$\n\nTaking the derivatives with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = -2\\sin{t}$\n$\\frac{dz}{dt} = 2\\cos{t}$\n\nSo, the tangent vector to the curve at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is $\\mathbf{t} = (-2\\sin{t}, 2\\cos{t}, 0)$.\n\nNow, we want the plane that contains the intersection curve and is perpendicular to the plane $y = 3x$. This means that the normal vector of the desired plane should be perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{n}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$. We can find this by taking the cross product of $\\mathbf{n}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$:\n\n$\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{n} \\times \\mathbf{t} = (3, -1, 0) \\times (-2\\sin{t}, 2\\cos{t}, 0) = (0, 0, 10\\cos{t}\\sin{t})$\n\nSince the normal vector of the desired plane is parallel to the z-axis, the plane must be of the form $z = C$ for some constant $C$. To find $C$, we can plug in the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ that lies on the intersection curve (3):\n\n$z_0 = 2\\sin{t_0}$\n\nSince $y_0^2 + z_0^2 = 8$, we have:\n\n$y_0^2 + (2\\sin{t_0})^2 = 8$\n\nNow, we can solve for $C$:\n\n$C = 2\\sin{t_0} = \\sqrt{8 - y_0^2}$\n\nSo, the equation of the desired plane is:\n\n$z = \\sqrt{8 - y^2}$"
