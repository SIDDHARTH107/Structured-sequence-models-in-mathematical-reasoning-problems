    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B is a subset of both set A and set B, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of set A and set B.\n\nFirst, let's find A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of set A and set B, we find that the common elements are 4 and 8.\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\n\nNow, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of set A and set B.\n\nLet x be an element of A ∩ B. Then, x ∈ A and x ∈ B.\n\nFor x = 4, we see that 4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ B, as 4 is an element of both set A and set B.\n\nFor x = 8, we see that 8 ∈ A and 8 ∈ B, as 8 is an element of both set A and set B.\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of set A and set B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of both set A and set B."
