    "message_2": "a) To find the partial derivatives, we will differentiate each component of f(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\nf(x, y) = (x^2 - 2xy + y^2 - 1, x^2 + 4y^2 - 4)\n\n∂f/∂x = (2x - 2y, 2x)\n∂f/∂y = (-2x + 2y, 8y)\n\nb) Newton's method for systems of nonlinear equations involves using the Jacobian matrix, which is the matrix of partial derivatives. In this case, the Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x - 2y, 2x |\n          | -2x + 2y, 8y |\n\nWe will use the following iterative formula for Newton's method:\n\n(x_new, y_new) = (x_old, y_old) - J(x_old, y_old)^(-1) * f(x_old, y_old)\n\nStarting with the initial point (1, 1):\n\nIteration 1:\nJ(1, 1) = | 0, 2 |\n          | -2, 8 |\n\nJ(1, 1)^(-1) = | 4, -1 |\n               | 1, 0  |\n\nf(1, 1) = (0, 0)\n\n(1, 1) - J(1, 1)^(-1) * f(1, 1) = (1, 1) - (0, 0) = (1, 1)\n\nSince f(1, 1) = (0, 0), the solution has already converged to the tolerance of 0.001 at the initial point (1, 1). Therefore, the solution to the system of nonlinear equations is (x, y) = (1, 1)."
