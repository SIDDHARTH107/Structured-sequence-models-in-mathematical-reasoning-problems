    "message_2": "To find the particular solution of the given differential equation y' = 2xy with initial condition y(0) = 3, we first need to solve the differential equation.\n\nThe given differential equation is a first-order linear homogeneous equation. We can solve it using the integrating factor method.\n\n1. Rewrite the equation in the form y' - 2xy = 0.\n\n2. Identify the integrating factor, which is the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y, i.e., e^(∫-2x dx).\n\n3. Calculate the integrating factor: e^(∫-2x dx) = e^(-x^2).\n\n4. Multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor: e^(-x^2)y' - 2xe^(-x^2)y = 0.\n\n5. The left-hand side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor: (ye^(-x^2))' = 0.\n\n6. Integrate both sides with respect to x: ∫(ye^(-x^2))' dx = ∫0 dx.\n\n7. This gives us ye^(-x^2) = C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition y(0) = 3.\n\n8. Plug in the initial condition: 3 = Ce^(0) => C = 3.\n\n9. Substitute the value of C back into the equation: y(x) = 3e^(x^2).\n\nThus, the particular solution of the given differential equation that satisfies the initial condition y(0) = 3 is y(x) = 3e^(x^2)."
