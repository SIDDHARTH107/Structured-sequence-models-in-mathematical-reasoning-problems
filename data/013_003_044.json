    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 has been given $100 to split with Player 2. Player 1 proposes a split and Player 2 can either accept or reject it. If Player 2 accepts, both players keep their respective amounts. If Player 2 rejects, both players get $0. What is an optimal proposal for Player 1 that maximizes their own payoff, assuming that Player 2 is rational and will accept any proposal that gives them at least $25?",
    "message_2": "Since Player 2 is rational and will accept any proposal that gives them at least $25, Player 1 should propose a split that gives Player 2 exactly $25 and keeps $75 for themselves. This way, Player 1 maximizes their own payoff while ensuring that Player 2 accepts the proposal. So the optimal proposal for Player 1 is to offer $25 to Player 2 and keep $75 for themselves."
