    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a problem for you to solve:\n\nA sample of radioactive material has an initial mass of 200 grams and a half-life of 5 days. Write an equation to model the mass of the sample as a function of time, and use it to find the mass after 15 days.",
    "message_2": "To model the mass of the radioactive material as a function of time, we can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nM(t) = M₀ * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere M(t) is the mass of the material at time t, M₀ is the initial mass, t is the time in days, and T is the half-life of the material.\n\nIn this problem, M₀ = 200 grams and T = 5 days. So the equation becomes:\n\nM(t) = 200 * (1/2)^(t/5)\n\nNow, we want to find the mass after 15 days. So, we'll plug in t = 15 into the equation:\n\nM(15) = 200 * (1/2)^(15/5)\n\nM(15) = 200 * (1/2)^3\n\nM(15) = 200 * (1/8)\n\nM(15) = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 15 days, the mass of the radioactive material will be 25 grams."
