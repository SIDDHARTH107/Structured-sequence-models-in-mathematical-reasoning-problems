    "message_1": "Unfortunately, the field of modal logic deals more with concepts and abstract reasoning rather than specific numerical problems. Therefore it may not be possible to provide a precise numerical problem for a student to solve. However, here is an example of a possible question in modal logic:\n\nUsing modal logic, prove the following statement: \"It is necessary that if today is Monday, then tomorrow is Tuesday.\"",
    "message_2": "To prove the statement \"It is necessary that if today is Monday, then tomorrow is Tuesday\" using modal logic, we can use the following symbols:\n\n- N: Necessity\n- M: Today is Monday\n- T: Tomorrow is Tuesday\n\nThe statement can be represented as:\n\nN(M → T)\n\nTo prove this statement, we can use the axioms and rules of inference of modal logic, such as Kripke semantics or possible world semantics. In this case, we will use Kripke semantics.\n\nKripke semantics is based on the idea of possible worlds and accessibility relations between them. A statement is necessary if it is true in all possible worlds. In our case, we need to show that the implication (M → T) is true in all possible worlds.\n\nLet's consider two cases:\n\n1. Today is not Monday (¬M): In this case, the implication (M → T) is true, because an implication is true if the antecedent is false.\n\n2. Today is Monday (M): In this case, we need to show that tomorrow is Tuesday (T). Since the days of the week follow a fixed order, if today is Monday in a possible world, then tomorrow must be Tuesday in that world. Therefore, the implication (M → T) is true in this case as well.\n\nSince the implication (M → T) is true in both cases, it is true in all possible worlds. Therefore, the statement \"It is necessary that if today is Monday, then tomorrow is Tuesday\" (N(M → T)) is true in modal logic."
