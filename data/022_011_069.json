    "message_1": "Consider the complex function f(z) = (z^3 - 6z^2 + 11z - 6)/(z^2 - 5z + 6). Find the poles and zeros of this function, and determine their order.",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^3 - 6z^2 + 11z - 6 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic polynomial, and we can try to factor it:\n\n(z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 3) = z^3 - 6z^2 + 11z - 6\n\nSo the zeros of the function are z = 1, z = 2, and z = 3. Each zero has order 1 since each factor appears only once in the numerator.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 5z + 6 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic polynomial, and we can factor it:\n\n(z - 2)(z - 3) = z^2 - 5z + 6\n\nSo the poles of the function are z = 2 and z = 3. However, we can see that the factors (z - 2) and (z - 3) are common in both the numerator and the denominator. Therefore, these poles are removable singularities, and the function has no actual poles after simplification.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) has zeros at z = 1, z = 2, and z = 3, each with order 1, and no poles after simplification."
