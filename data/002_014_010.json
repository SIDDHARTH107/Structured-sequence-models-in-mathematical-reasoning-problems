    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 12 cm, width of 8 cm, and height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length × width): 12 cm × 8 cm = 96 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 96 cm² = 192 cm².\n\n2. The area of the second pair of opposite faces (length × height): 12 cm × 4 cm = 48 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 48 cm² = 96 cm².\n\n3. The area of the third pair of opposite faces (width × height): 8 cm × 4 cm = 32 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 32 cm² = 64 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all three pairs of faces together:\n\n192 cm² + 96 cm² + 64 cm² = 352 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 352 cm²."
