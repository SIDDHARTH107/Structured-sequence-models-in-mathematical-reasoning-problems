    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nThe Acme Publishing Company can produce two types of books: hardbacks and paperbacks. To produce a hardback book requires three hours of typesetting and four hours of binding, and yields a profit of $\\$8$. To produce a paperback book requires two hours of typesetting and two hours of binding, and yields a profit of $\\$6$. The company has a maximum of 36 hours of typesetting time and 40 hours of binding time available. How many of each type of book should the company produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of hardback books and y be the number of paperback books produced.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 8x + 6y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. Typesetting time constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 36\n2. Binding time constraint: 4x + 2y ≤ 40\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 36\n   y ≤ (36 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 4x + 2y ≤ 40\n   y ≤ (40 - 4x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and x-axis (y = 0):\n   3x = 36\n   x = 12\n\n   Point A: (12, 0)\n\n2. Intersection of constraint 2 and x-axis (y = 0):\n   4x = 40\n   x = 10\n\n   Point B: (10, 0)\n\n3. Intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2:\n   (36 - 3x) / 2 = (40 - 4x) / 2\n   36 - 3x = 40 - 4x\n   x = 4\n\n   y = (36 - 3 * 4) / 2 = 12\n\n   Point C: (4, 12)\n\n4. Intersection of constraint 1 and y-axis (x = 0):\n   2y = 36\n   y = 18\n\n   Point D: (0, 18)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 8x + 6y at each corner point:\n\n1. P(12, 0) = 8 * 12 + 6 * 0 = 96\n2. P(10, 0) = 8 * 10 + 6 * 0 = 80\n3. P(4, 12) = 8 * 4 + 6 * 12 = 104\n4. P(0, 18) = 8 * 0 + 6 * 18 = 108\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point D (0, 18), where the company should produce 0 hardback books and 18 paperback books for a maximum profit of $108."
