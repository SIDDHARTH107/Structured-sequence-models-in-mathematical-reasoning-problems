    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the water level (height) is rising with respect to time when the water is 4 feet deep. Let V be the volume of the water in the tank, r be the radius of the tank, and h be the height of the water in the tank. We are given:\n\nr = 5 feet\ndV/dt = 2 cubic feet per minute\n\nWe want to find dh/dt when h = 4 feet.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nSince the radius of the tank is constant, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = πr^2(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dh/dt:\n\n2 = π(5^2)(dh/dt)\n\n2 = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 25π:\n\ndh/dt = 2 / (25π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ 0.02546 feet per minute\n\nSo, when the water is 4 feet deep, the water level is rising at a rate of approximately 0.02546 feet per minute."
