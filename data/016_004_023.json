    "message_2": "The largest connected section of the Mandelbrot set is the main cardioid. The farthest point from the center of the main cardioid is at a distance of r = 2 (since the main cardioid has a diameter of 2).\n\nUsing the formula A = πr^2, we can calculate the area of the largest connected section:\n\nA = π(2)^2\nA = π(4)\nA = 4π\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nA ≈ 4 * 3.14159\nA ≈ 12.56636\n\nRounded to the nearest thousandth, the area of the largest connected section of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 12.566."
