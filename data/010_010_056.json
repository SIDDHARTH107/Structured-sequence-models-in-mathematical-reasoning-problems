    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = x^4 + y^4 - 4xy, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 4x^3 - 4y\n∂f/∂y = 4y^3 - 4x\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations to find the critical points:\n\n4x^3 - 4y = 0\n4y^3 - 4x = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 4:\n\nx^3 - y = 0\ny^3 - x = 0\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. From the first equation, we get:\n\ny = x^3\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n(x^3)^3 - x = 0\nx^9 - x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(x^8 - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = 0\nx^8 - 1 = 0 => x = ±1\n\nNow we can find the corresponding y values:\n\n1. x = 0:\ny = (0)^3 = 0\n=> (x, y) = (0, 0)\n\n2. x = 1:\ny = (1)^3 = 1\n=> (x, y) = (1, 1)\n\n3. x = -1:\ny = (-1)^3 = -1\n=> (x, y) = (-1, -1)\n\nSo, we have three critical points: (0, 0), (1, 1), and (-1, -1).\n\nNow let's classify these critical points using Morse theory. We need to compute the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\nH(f) = | ∂^2f/∂x^2  ∂^2f/∂x∂y |\n          | ∂^2f/∂y∂x  ∂^2f/∂y^2 |\n\nCompute the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂^2f/∂x^2 = 12x^2\n∂^2f/∂x∂y = -4\n∂^2f/∂y∂x = -4\n∂^2f/∂y^2 = 12y^2\n\nNow let's evaluate the Hessian matrix at each critical point:\n\n1. (0, 0):\nH(f) = |  0  -4 |\n          | -4   0 |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is det(H) = 0 * 0 - (-4) * (-4) = -16, which is negative. Therefore, the critical point (0, 0) is a saddle point.\n\n2. (1, 1):\nH(f) = | 12  -4 |\n          | -4  12 |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is det(H) = 12 * 12 - (-4) * (-4) = 144 - 16 = 128, which is positive. Since both diagonal elements are positive, the critical point (1, 1) is a local minimum.\n\n3. (-1, -1):\nH(f) = | 12  -4 |\n          | -4  12 |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is the same as in the previous case, det(H) = 128, which is positive. Since both diagonal elements are positive, the critical point (-1, -1) is also a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found three critical points for the function f(x, y) = x^4 + y^4 - 4xy: (0, 0) is a saddle point, and (1, 1) and (-1, -1) are local minima."
