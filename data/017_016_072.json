    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 27, we can use the fact that 27 = 3^3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of groups of order p^n (where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer) is determined by the number of possible factorizations of the group's order.\n\nIn this case, we have the following factorizations of 27:\n\n1. 27 = 3^3\n\nSince 27 is a prime power, we can use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: If G is a group of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, then G has a normal subgroup of order p^i for every 0 ≤ i ≤ n.\n\nUsing this theorem, we can find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 27:\n\n1. For the factorization 27 = 3^3, we have a group of order 3^3. By the theorem, this group has normal subgroups of order 3^0 = 1, 3^1 = 3, and 3^2 = 9. There are two possibilities for the group structure: either it is a direct product of its subgroups, or it is a semi-direct product of its subgroups.\n\nIn the first case, the group is the direct product of a group of order 3 and a group of order 9. Since there is only one group of order 3 (up to isomorphism), namely the cyclic group C3, and there is only one group of order 9 (up to isomorphism), namely the cyclic group C9, the direct product is C3 x C9, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nIn the second case, the group is a semi-direct product of a group of order 3 and a group of order 9. There are two possible semi-direct products, depending on the action of the group of order 3 on the group of order 9. One of these actions is trivial, which gives the direct product C3 x C9 (which we already counted). The other action is non-trivial, which gives a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nThus, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 27: the cyclic group C27 and a non-abelian group."
