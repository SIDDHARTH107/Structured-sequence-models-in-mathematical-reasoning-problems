    "message_2": "(1) Geometric intersection:\n\nThe geometric intersection number between two simple closed curves $S$ and $T$ on a closed surface $M$ of genus $g$ is defined as the minimum number of intersection points between any two representatives of the homotopy classes of $S$ and $T$. In this case, the intersection number is given as $n$. \n\n(2) Algebraic intersection:\n\nThe algebraic intersection number between two simple closed curves $S$ and $T$ on a closed surface $M$ of genus $g$ is defined as the sum of the signs of the intersections between any two representatives of the homotopy classes of $S$ and $T$. The sign of an intersection is positive if the orientation of the intersection agrees with the orientation of the surface, and negative otherwise.\n\nTo compute the algebraic intersection number, we can use the formula:\n\n$$I(S, T) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{sign}(p_i)$$\n\nwhere $p_i$ are the intersection points between $S$ and $T$, and $\\text{sign}(p_i)$ is the sign of the intersection at point $p_i$.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific curves $S$ and $T$ and their intersection points, we cannot determine the algebraic intersection number."
