    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and M is the magnification factor.\n\nIn the case of the Lévy C curve, each straight line segment is replaced with three segments of equal length, so N = 3. The magnification factor, M, is the factor by which each segment is scaled down, which is 2 (since each of the three new segments is half the length of the original segment).\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Lévy C curve is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2) ≈ 1.5849625"
