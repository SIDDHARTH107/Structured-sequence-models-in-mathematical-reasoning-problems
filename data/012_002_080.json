    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph G with seven vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to know the structure of the graph. The chromatic number of a graph depends on its structure and the maximum degree of its vertices.\n\nIn general, the chromatic number χ(G) of a graph G can be found using the following inequality:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nwhere Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph G.\n\nHowever, without knowing the structure of the graph G or the maximum degree of its vertices, it is impossible to determine the exact chromatic number. Please provide more information about the graph G."
