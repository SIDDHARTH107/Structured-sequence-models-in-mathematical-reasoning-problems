    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2sin(x) + √2 = 0, we first isolate sin(x):\n\n2sin(x) = -√2\nsin(x) = -√2 / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x between 0 and 2π for which sin(x) = -√2 / 2.\n\nWe know that sin(x) = -√2 / 2 at x = 7π/4 and x = 5π/4, as these are the angles in the third and fourth quadrants where the sine function is negative and has a magnitude of √2 / 2.\n\nSo, the solutions for the given equation between 0 and 2π are:\n\nx = 5π/4 and x = 7π/4"
