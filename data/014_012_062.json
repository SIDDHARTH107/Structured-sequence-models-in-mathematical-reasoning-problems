    "message_1": "A message is encrypted using the Vigenere cipher with a keyword \"MATH\". The message is \"SECRET\". Using the Vigenere table, encode the message.",
    "message_2": "To encode the message \"SECRET\" using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we first need to repeat the keyword to match the length of the message. In this case, the keyword becomes \"MATHMA\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere table to encode each letter of the message using the corresponding letter of the keyword. The Vigenere table is a 26x26 grid of letters, where each row represents a Caesar cipher with a different shift. The keyword letter determines the row to use for encoding.\n\nHere's the encoding process for each letter:\n\n1. S (message) and M (keyword): Find the row starting with M and look for the column with S. The encoded letter is W.\n2. E (message) and A (keyword): Find the row starting with A and look for the column with E. The encoded letter is E.\n3. C (message) and T (keyword): Find the row starting with T and look for the column with C. The encoded letter is R.\n4. R (message) and H (keyword): Find the row starting with H and look for the column with R. The encoded letter is Y.\n5. E (message) and M (keyword): Find the row starting with M and look for the column with E. The encoded letter is K.\n6. T (message) and A (keyword): Find the row starting with A and look for the column with T. The encoded letter is T.\n\nSo, the encoded message using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATH\" is \"WERYKT\"."
