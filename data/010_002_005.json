Consider the sequence $(a_n)$ defined by $a_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Determine whether this sequence converges to a limit in the topological space $X$ or not.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence $(a_n)$ converges to a limit in the topological space $X$, we need to find a limit point $L \\in X$ such that for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, we have $d(a_n, L) < \\epsilon$.\n\nLet's consider the limit point $L = 0$. Now, we need to show that for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, we have $d(a_n, L) = |a_n - 0| = |a_n| < \\epsilon$.\n\nSince $a_n = \\frac{1}{n}$, we have $|a_n| = \\frac{1}{n}$. Given any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $N$ such that $\\frac{1}{N} < \\epsilon$. This is because the sequence $\\frac{1}{n}$ is strictly decreasing and converges to 0 as $n$ goes to infinity. Therefore, for all $n \\geq N$, we have $|a_n| = \\frac{1}{n} \\leq \\frac{1}{N} < \\epsilon$.\n\nThus, the sequence $(a_n)$ converges to the limit point $L = 0$ in the topological space $X$."
