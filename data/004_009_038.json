    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together: u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = sin(x). \n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is given by:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(x^2)/dx = 2x\nv'(x) = d(sin(x))/dx = cos(x)\n\nNow, we apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(sin(x)) + (x^2)(cos(x))\n\nTo find f'(π/2), we substitute x = π/2 into the derivative:\n\nf'(π/2) = (2(π/2))(sin(π/2)) + ((π/2)^2)(cos(π/2))\n\nf'(π/2) = (π)(1) + (π^2/4)(0)\n\nf'(π/2) = π\n\nSo, f'(π/2) = π."
