    "message_1": "A circular track has a radius of 20 meters. What is the perimeter of the circular track?",
    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circular track is also known as its circumference. The formula to calculate the circumference of a circle is C = 2 * π * r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nGiven the radius r = 20 meters, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2 * π * 20\nC ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 20\nC ≈ 125.6637 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circular track is approximately 125.66 meters."
