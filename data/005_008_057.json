The number of defective components per day is recorded and is shown in the following table:\n\nDay  Defective Components\n1    5\n2    7\n3    6\n4    4\n5    10\n6    8\n.     .\n.     .\n.     .\n\nUsing time series analysis, determine the forecasted number of defective components for the next 5 days.",
    "message_2": "To forecast the number of defective components for the next 5 days using time series analysis, we can use the moving average method. However, since we only have data for the first 6 days, we will use this limited data to calculate the moving average and forecast the next 5 days. Ideally, we would have the data for all 180 days to make a more accurate forecast.\n\nFirst, calculate the moving average for the given data:\n\n(5 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 10 + 8) / 6 = 40 / 6 = 6.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we can use this moving average to forecast the number of defective components for the next 5 days:\n\nDay 181: 6.67\nDay 182: 6.67\nDay 183: 6.67\nDay 184: 6.67\nDay 185: 6.67\n\nAccording to the moving average method, the forecasted number of defective components for the next 5 days is approximately 6.67 per day. Keep in mind that this is a simple forecasting method and may not be entirely accurate, especially considering the limited data available."
