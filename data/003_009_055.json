    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Since we have a right triangle with one angle measuring 30 degrees, the other angle must be 60 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees and we already have a 90-degree angle).\n\nWe can use the sine and cosine functions to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the side opposite the 30-degree angle \"a\" and the side opposite the 60-degree angle \"b\".\n\nsin(30) = a / 10\na = 10 * sin(30)\na = 10 * 0.5\na = 5 cm\n\ncos(30) = b / 10\nb = 10 * cos(30)\nb = 10 * (√3 / 2)\nb = 5√3 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + hypotenuse\nPerimeter = 5 + 5√3 + 10\nPerimeter = 15 + 5√3 cm"
