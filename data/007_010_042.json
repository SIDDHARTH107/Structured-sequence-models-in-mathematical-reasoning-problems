    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we need to find a number x that satisfies the following two congruences:\n\n1. x ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n2. x ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nAccording to the Chinese remainder theorem, since 3 and 5 are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), there exists a unique solution for x modulo their product, which is 15.\n\nNow, let's find the solution step by step:\n\n1. Compute the product of the moduli: M = 3 * 5 = 15\n2. Calculate the modular inverses:\n   a. M1 = M / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5\n      Find the inverse of M1 modulo 3, i.e., a number y1 such that (5 * y1) % 3 = 1\n      We can see that y1 = 2, since (5 * 2) % 3 = 10 % 3 = 1\n   b. M2 = M / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3\n      Find the inverse of M2 modulo 5, i.e., a number y2 such that (3 * y2) % 5 = 1\n      We can see that y2 = 2, since (3 * 2) % 5 = 6 % 5 = 1\n3. Compute the solution:\n   x = (2 * M1 * y1 + 1 * M2 * y2) % M\n   x = (2 * 5 * 2 + 1 * 3 * 2) % 15\n   x = (20 + 6) % 15\n   x = 26 % 15\n   x = 11\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 11."
