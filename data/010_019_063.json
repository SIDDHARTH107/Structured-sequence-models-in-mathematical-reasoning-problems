    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology groups of the function f(x, y) = cos(x) + cos(y) + cos(x + y) on a 2-dimensional torus, we first need to find the critical points of the function and their indices. The critical points are the points where the gradient of the function vanishes.\n\nThe gradient of f is given by:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (-sin(x) - sin(x + y), -sin(y) - sin(x + y))\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n-sin(x) - sin(x + y) = 0\n-sin(y) - sin(x + y) = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find the critical points:\n\n(x, y) = (0, 0), (0, π), (π, 0), (π, π)\n\nNow, we need to compute the Hessian matrix of f at each critical point to determine the Morse index. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\nHf(x, y) = | -cos(x) - cos(x + y)   -cos(x + y) |\n           | -cos(x + y)            -cos(y) - cos(x + y) |\n\nEvaluating the Hessian matrix at each critical point:\n\nHf(0, 0) = | -2   0 |\n           |  0  -2 |\n\nHf(0, π) = |  0   2 |\n           |  2  -2 |\n\nHf(π, 0) = | -2   2 |\n           |  2   0 |\n\nHf(π, π) = |  0   0 |\n           |  0   2 |\n\nNow, we compute the Morse index, which is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at each critical point:\n\nIndex(0, 0) = 2\nIndex(0, π) = 1\nIndex(π, 0) = 1\nIndex(π, π) = 0\n\nThus, we have two critical points of index 0, two critical points of index 1, and one critical point of index 2. The Morse homology groups are given by:\n\nH_0 = Z^2\nH_1 = Z^2\nH_2 = Z\n\nSo, the Morse homology groups associated with the function f(x, y) = cos(x) + cos(y) + cos(x + y) on a 2-dimensional torus are H_0 = Z^2, H_1 = Z^2, and H_2 = Z."
