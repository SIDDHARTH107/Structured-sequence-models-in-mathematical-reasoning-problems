    "message_2": "A rail fence cipher with 3 rails arranges the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows. The message \"HELLO WORLD\" would be arranged as follows:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the letters row by row to get the encrypted message. The encrypted message is: \"HORELWLDLO\""
