    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Liouville's theorem, which states that a bounded entire function must be constant. An entire function is a function that is holomorphic (analytic) on the entire complex plane.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given equation as:\n\n$z^7 + 2z^5 + 3z^2 = -1$\n\nNow, let's consider the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^7 + 2z^5 + 3z^2 + 1}$. This function is entire, as it is the reciprocal of a polynomial with no roots (since we are looking for the roots of the polynomial).\n\nNext, we will show that $f(z)$ is bounded on the unit circle. On the unit circle, $|z| = 1$. Using the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n$|z^7 + 2z^5 + 3z^2| \\ge |1 - (|z^7| + 2|z^5| + 3|z^2|)|$\n\nSince $|z|=1$, we have:\n\n$|z^7 + 2z^5 + 3z^2| \\ge |1 - (1 + 2 + 3)| = |-5| = 5$\n\nThus, $|f(z)| \\le \\frac{1}{5}$ for all $z$ on the unit circle.\n\nNow, by Liouville's theorem, since $f(z)$ is entire and bounded on the unit circle, it must be constant. This means that $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^7 + 2z^5 + 3z^2 + 1}$ is constant for all $z$ in the unit circle.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, as the function is clearly not constant. Therefore, there can be no roots of the equation $z^7 + 2z^5 + 3z^2 + 1 = 0$ within the unit circle centered at the origin. The maximum number of roots within the unit circle is 0."
