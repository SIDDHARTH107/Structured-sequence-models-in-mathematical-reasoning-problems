    "message_2": "The regular expression (0+1)*0(0+1)* represents a language that contains strings with at least one '0'. To construct a DFA that accepts this language, we need a minimum of two states:\n\n1. Initial state (q0): This state represents that we have not seen a '0' yet. If we see a '0', we move to the next state. If we see a '1', we stay in this state.\n2. Accepting state (q1): This state represents that we have seen at least one '0'. If we see a '0' or '1', we stay in this state.\n\nHere is the transition table for the DFA:\n\n| Current State | Input | Next State |\n|---------------|-------|------------|\n| q0            | 0     | q1         |\n| q0            | 1     | q0         |\n| q1            | 0     | q1         |\n| q1            | 1     | q1         |\n\nSo, the minimum number of states required for a DFA to accept the language represented by the regular expression (0+1)*0(0+1)* is 2."
