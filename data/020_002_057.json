    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to nonlinear programming:\n\nA farmer has 500 acres of land to cultivate two crops: wheat and corn. The farmer can earn a profit of $200 per acre for wheat and $300 per acre for corn. The farmer has 400 labor hours available for the season. Cultivating one acre of wheat requires 4 labor hours and one acre of corn requires 6 labor hours. How many acres of wheat and corn should the farmer plant to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of corn. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 200x + 300y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 500 (total acres constraint)\n2. 4x + 6y ≤ 400 (labor hours constraint)\n3. x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ 500 - x\n2. y ≤ (400 - 4x) / 6\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nA. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\nB. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (400 - 4x) / 6: (0, 400/6) = (0, 200/3)\nC. Intersection of y = 500 - x and y = (400 - 4x) / 6:\n   500 - x = (400 - 4x) / 6\n   6(500 - x) = 400 - 4x\n   3000 - 6x = 400 - 4x\n   2600 = 2x\n   x = 1300/2 = 650/1 = 650\n   y = 500 - 650 = -150 (not valid since y ≥ 0)\n\nSo, we have two corner points: A (0, 0) and B (0, 200/3).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at these corner points:\n\nP(A) = 200(0) + 300(0) = 0\nP(B) = 200(0) + 300(200/3) = 20000\n\nThe maximum profit is $20,000, which occurs when the farmer plants 0 acres of wheat and 200/3 ≈ 66.67 acres of corn."
