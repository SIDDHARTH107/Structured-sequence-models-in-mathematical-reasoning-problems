    "message_2": "To find the expected number of employees who may fall victim to the attack, we can multiply the total number of employees by the probability of a ransomware attack.\n\nExpected number of victims = Total number of employees × Probability of attack\n\nExpected number of victims = 1000 × 0.15\n\nExpected number of victims = 150\n\nSo, the expected number of employees who may fall victim to the ransomware attack is 150."
