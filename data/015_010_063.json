    "message_2": "To calculate the Poincare map, we need to find the intersection points of the trajectory with a specific surface of section in the xy-plane. In this case, let's choose the surface of section to be the line x = 1. \n\nSince we are given the initial condition (x0, y0) = (1, 0), we can start by integrating the given differential equations to find the trajectory of the system. However, due to the nonlinearity of the system, it is not possible to find an analytical solution. Therefore, we will use numerical methods to find the intersection points.\n\nLet's use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to integrate the system. We will integrate the system until it intersects the line x = 1 again. The intersection points will give us the Poincare map.\n\nHere is a Python code to perform the numerical integration and find the intersection points:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef chaotic_system(t, Y):\n    x, y = Y\n    dx_dt = y\n    dy_dt = -4 * x - y * (1 - x**2)\n    return [dx_dt, dy_dt]\n\ndef event(t, Y):\n    x, y = Y\n    return x - 1\n\nevent.direction = 1  # Only consider intersections when x is increasing\nevent.terminal = False\n\ninitial_condition = [1, 0]\nt_span = (0, 100)\nsol = solve_ivp(chaotic_system, t_span, initial_condition, events=event, dense_output=True)\n\nintersection_points = sol.y_events[0]\n\n# Plot the Poincare map\nplt.scatter(intersection_points[:, 0], intersection_points[:, 1], s=5)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('Poincare map')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will generate a Poincare map for the given chaotic system. Note that the Poincare map is a discrete set of points, and the specific points will depend on the chosen surface of section and the integration time."
