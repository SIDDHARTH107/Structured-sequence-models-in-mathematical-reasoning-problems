    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| -3  4 -1 |  5 |\n|  2 -1  3 | -1 |\n|  1  2 -1 |  3 |\n\nStep 1: Add 3 times the third row to the first row to eliminate the first element in the first row:\n\n| 0  10 -4 | 14 |\n| 2 -1  3  | -1 |\n| 1  2 -1  |  3 |\n\nStep 2: Swap the first and second rows:\n\n| 2 -1  3  | -1 |\n| 0  10 -4 | 14 |\n| 1  2 -1  |  3 |\n\nStep 3: Divide the first row by 2:\n\n| 1 -1/2  3/2 | -1/2 |\n| 0  10  -4   |  14  |\n| 1  2   -1   |  3   |\n\nStep 4: Subtract the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1 -1/2  3/2 | -1/2 |\n| 0  10  -4   |  14  |\n| 0  5/2 -1/2 |  7/2 |\n\nStep 5: Divide the second row by 10:\n\n| 1 -1/2  3/2 | -1/2 |\n| 0  1   -2/5 |  7/5 |\n| 0  5/2 -1/2 |  7/2 |\n\nStep 6: Add 1/2 times the second row to the first row:\n\n| 1 0  4/5 | 0 |\n| 0 1 -2/5 | 7/5 |\n| 0 5/2 -1/2 | 7/2 |\n\nStep 7: Subtract 5/2 times the second row from the third row:\n\n| 1 0  4/5 | 0 |\n| 0 1 -2/5 | 7/5 |\n| 0 0  1   | 3 |\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. We can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = 4/5\ny = 7/5\nz = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4/5, y = 7/5, and z = 3."
