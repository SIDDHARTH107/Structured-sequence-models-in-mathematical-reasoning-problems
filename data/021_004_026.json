    "message_1": "Consider the function f(x) = sin(x). Use the five-point forward difference formula to approximate f'(x) at x = 0.5 with h=0.1, and compute the absolute error of the approximation. Then, use the composite trapezoidal rule with n=4 to approximate the definite integral of f(x) from x=0 to x=π/2 with h=(π/2)/4, and compute the absolute error of the approximation.",
    "message_2": "First, let's approximate f'(x) at x = 0.5 using the five-point forward difference formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (-f(x+2h) + 8f(x+h) - 8f(x-h) + f(x-2h)) / (12h)\n\nWe are given x = 0.5 and h = 0.1. So, we can plug in these values and the function f(x) = sin(x) into the formula:\n\nf'(0.5) ≈ (-sin(0.5+2*0.1) + 8sin(0.5+0.1) - 8sin(0.5-0.1) + sin(0.5-2*0.1)) / (12*0.1)\nf'(0.5) ≈ (-sin(0.7) + 8sin(0.6) - 8sin(0.4) + sin(0.3)) / 1.2\n\nNow, we can compute the approximation:\n\nf'(0.5) ≈ (-0.6442176872 + 8*0.5646424734 - 8*0.3894183423 + 0.2955202067) / 1.2\nf'(0.5) ≈ (0.9297969611)\n\nThe exact value of f'(0.5) is cos(0.5), which is approximately 0.8775825619. So, the absolute error of the approximation is:\n\n|0.9297969611 - 0.8775825619| = 0.0522143992\n\nNext, let's approximate the definite integral of f(x) = sin(x) from x = 0 to x = π/2 using the composite trapezoidal rule with n = 4:\n\n∫(from 0 to π/2) sin(x) dx ≈ (h/2) * (f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + f(x4))\n\nWe are given h = (π/2) / 4. So, we can plug in these values and the function f(x) = sin(x) into the formula:\n\n∫(from 0 to π/2) sin(x) dx ≈ ((π/8) * (sin(0) + 2sin(π/8) + 2sin(π/4) + 2sin(3π/8) + sin(π/2)))\n\nNow, we can compute the approximation:\n\n∫(from 0 to π/2) sin(x) dx ≈ (0.3926990817 * (0 + 2*0.3826834324 + 2*0.7071067812 + 2*0.9238795325 + 1))\n∫(from 0 to π/2) sin(x) dx ≈ 1.0079421098\n\nThe exact value of the definite integral is 1. So, the absolute error of the approximation is:\n\n|1.0079421098 - 1| = 0.0079421098\n\nIn summary, the absolute error of the five-point forward difference formula approximation for f'(0.5) is 0.0522143992, and the absolute error of the composite trapezoidal rule approximation for the definite integral of f(x) from x = 0 to x = π/2 is 0.0079421098."
