    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where a is the element and e is the identity element of the group.\n3. Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group G divides the order of G.\n4. A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of elements in G. Since the order of G is 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are divisors of 6, which are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nThere must be an element of order 1, which is the identity element e. If there is an element of order 6, then G is generated by that element and is cyclic, making G isomorphic to C6.\n\nIf there is no element of order 6, then the remaining possible orders for elements in G are 2 and 3. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3. Then, a^2 = e and b^3 = e.\n\nNow, consider the product ab. Since a and b have different orders, ab â‰  e. Also, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ee = e, which implies that (ab)^3 = e. Thus, the order of ab is either 2 or 3.\n\nIf the order of ab is 2, then (ab)^2 = e, so b^2 = a^(-1) = a, since a has order 2. Then, b^3 = ab, which contradicts the fact that b has order 3. Therefore, the order of ab must be 3.\n\nNow, we can construct the multiplication table for G:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  b^2 ab ab^2\n---+---------------------\n e | e  a  b  b^2 ab ab^2\n a | a  e  ab ab^2 b  b^2\n b | b  ab b^2 e  ab^2 a\nb^2| b^2 ab^2 a  b  e  ab\nab | ab b^2 ab^2 a  b  e\nab^2|ab^2 b  e  ab b^2 a\n```\n\nThis multiplication table has the same structure as the dihedral group D3, which has elements {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2} and relations r^3 = e, s^2 = e, and sr = r^(-1)s. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 6, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
