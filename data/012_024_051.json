    "message_2": "To find the genus of a graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 10 and E = 25. We need to find the maximum number of faces (F) that the graph can have to determine the minimum genus.\n\nAccording to the Handshaking lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) = 2E\n\nSince the graph is simple (no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices), the maximum degree of a vertex is V - 1. In this case, the maximum degree is 10 - 1 = 9. However, having all vertices with degree 9 would result in more than 25 edges, so we need to distribute the degrees more evenly.\n\nA planar graph follows the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n25 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n25 ≤ 30 - 6\n25 ≤ 24\n\nThis inequality is false, which means the graph is not planar. Now, we need to find the genus of the graph. We can use the inequality for a graph with genus g:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for g:\n\ng ≥ (E - 3V + 6) / 6\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ng ≥ (25 - 3(10) + 6) / 6\ng ≥ (25 - 30 + 6) / 6\ng ≥ 1\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, the minimum genus of the graph is 1."
