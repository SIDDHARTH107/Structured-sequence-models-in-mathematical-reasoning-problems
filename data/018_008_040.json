    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {4, 5}. Calculate the Cartesian product of A and B, then calculate the Cartesian product of B and A. Show that the two results are not equal, and explain why the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nLet's calculate the Cartesian product of A and B (A x B):\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian product of B and A (B x A):\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the two results are not equal:\n\nA x B â‰  B x A\n\nThis is because the ordered pairs in A x B have elements from set A as their first component and elements from set B as their second component, while the ordered pairs in B x A have elements from set B as their first component and elements from set A as their second component.\n\nThe Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative because the order of the elements in the ordered pairs matters. In other words, (a, b) is not the same as (b, a) unless a = b. This is a fundamental property of ordered pairs and is the reason why the Cartesian product operation is not commutative."
