    "message_1": "A group of 6 friends want to create a seating arrangement with 3 of them sitting on each side of a rectangular table. How many different seating arrangements are possible if they do not care which side they sit on?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different seating arrangements, we can use the concept of combinations and permutations.\n\nFirst, we need to choose which 3 friends will sit on one side of the table and which 3 will sit on the other side. We can use the combination formula for this:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (6) and r is the number of friends we want to choose (3).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 different ways to choose which 3 friends will sit on one side and which 3 will sit on the other side.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the 3 friends on each side. We can use the permutation formula for this:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends on one side (3) and r is the number of friends we want to arrange (3).\n\nP(3, 3) = 3! / (3-3)! = 6 / 1 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 different ways to arrange the 3 friends on each side.\n\nSince there are 20 ways to choose which friends sit on each side and 6 ways to arrange them on each side, we multiply these numbers together to find the total number of seating arrangements:\n\n20 (ways to choose) * 6 (arrangements on one side) * 6 (arrangements on the other side) = 720\n\nHowever, since the friends do not care which side they sit on, we need to divide this number by 2 to account for the fact that the same arrangement can be achieved by simply switching sides:\n\n720 / 2 = 360\n\nTherefore, there are 360 different seating arrangements possible."
