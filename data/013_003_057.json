If Player 2 accepts, the division is made as proposed. If Player 2 rejects, neither player gets any money. Find the Nash equilibrium of this game.",
    "message_2": "In the ultimatum game, a Nash equilibrium occurs when neither player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategy of the other player. \n\nLet's consider the strategies of both players:\n\nPlayer 1's strategy: Propose a division of the $50 (x for Player 1 and 50-x for Player 2, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 50).\n\nPlayer 2's strategy: Set a minimum acceptable offer (y, where 0 ≤ y ≤ 50) and accept any offer greater than or equal to y, and reject any offer less than y.\n\nIn order for a Nash equilibrium to occur, Player 1 needs to propose an offer that Player 2 will accept, and Player 2 needs to have no incentive to change their minimum acceptable offer.\n\nPlayer 1 knows that if they propose an offer that is less than Player 2's minimum acceptable offer, they will get nothing. Therefore, Player 1's best strategy is to propose an offer that is just equal to or slightly greater than Player 2's minimum acceptable offer.\n\nPlayer 2 knows that if they set their minimum acceptable offer too high, they risk getting nothing. However, if they set it too low, they may get less than they could have. In this game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when Player 2 sets their minimum acceptable offer as low as possible, which is $0.\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium in this ultimatum game is when Player 1 proposes a division of the $50 such that they keep almost the entire amount (x ≈ 50) and offers a very small amount to Player 2 (50-x ≈ 0). Player 2 accepts this offer because it is greater than or equal to their minimum acceptable offer of $0, and neither player has an incentive to change their strategy."
