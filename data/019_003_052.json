    "message_2": "To evaluate the truth value of φ, we will substitute the given values of p, q, and r into the formula and then simplify.\n\nφ = (p → r) ∧ (q → r) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q)\n\nGiven p = true, q = false, and r = true, we have:\n\nφ = (true → true) ∧ (false → true) ∧ (¬true ∨ ¬false)\n\nNow, let's simplify the formula step by step:\n\n1. Recall that (A → B) is equivalent to (¬A ∨ B). So, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nφ = (¬true ∨ true) ∧ (¬false ∨ true) ∧ (¬true ∨ ¬false)\n\n2. Now, let's simplify the negations:\n\nφ = (¬true ∨ true) ∧ (true ∨ true) ∧ (false ∨ true)\n\n3. ¬true is false, and ¬false is true. So, we have:\n\nφ = (false ∨ true) ∧ (true ∨ true) ∧ (false ∨ true)\n\n4. Now, let's simplify the disjunctions (A ∨ B is true if either A or B is true):\n\nφ = true ∧ true ∧ true\n\n5. Finally, let's simplify the conjunctions (A ∧ B is true if both A and B are true):\n\nφ = true\n\nSo, under the given interpretation, the truth value of φ is true."
