    "message_1": "Consider a stream cipher that uses a key of length 10 bits to encrypt a plaintext of length 16 bits using exclusive OR (XOR) operation. In this cipher, the key is reused to generate a keystream of length 16 bits that is XORed with the plaintext. What is the maximum number of different keys that can be used in this cipher?",
    "message_2": "Since the key has a length of 10 bits, there are 2^10 possible different keys that can be used in this cipher. \n\n2^10 = 1024\n\nSo, the maximum number of different keys that can be used in this cipher is 1024."
