    "message_2": "In classical logic, the statement would be considered true because it takes the form of \"If false, then false.\" However, in relevance logic, the antecedent (3 + 5 = 7) must be relevant to the consequent (2 x 2 = 5) for the implication to be true. Since the antecedent and consequent are unrelated, the truth value of the statement in relevance logic is false."
