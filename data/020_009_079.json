    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces two types of products - A and B. The daily profit from producing each unit of A and B is $10 and $12, respectively. The daily production capacity for A and B is 100 and 80 units, respectively. However, the production process is subject to uncertainties and the actual production of each product may vary with a probability distribution. The daily production of A and B follow a normal distribution with a mean of 90 and 70 units, respectively, and the standard deviation of both distributions is 5 units. What should be the daily production quantities for A and B to maximize the expected daily profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the expected daily profit, we should aim to produce as many units of A and B as possible within the production capacity constraints, while considering the probability distribution of the production quantities.\n\nLet's denote the daily production quantities for A and B as x and y, respectively. The expected daily profit can be represented as:\n\nExpected Profit = 10x + 12y\n\nSince the production capacity for A and B is 100 and 80 units, respectively, we have the following constraints:\n\nx ≤ 100\ny ≤ 80\n\nNow, we need to consider the probability distribution of the production quantities. Since the daily production of A and B follow a normal distribution with a mean of 90 and 70 units, respectively, and a standard deviation of 5 units, we can calculate the probability of producing x units of A and y units of B using the normal distribution formula:\n\nP(x) = (1/(5√(2π))) * e^(-(x-90)^2 / (2 * 5^2))\nP(y) = (1/(5√(2π))) * e^(-(y-70)^2 / (2 * 5^2))\n\nTo maximize the expected daily profit, we should aim to produce the quantities of A and B that have the highest probability of being produced, while still satisfying the production capacity constraints.\n\nSince the mean of the normal distribution represents the most likely value, we should aim to produce 90 units of A and 70 units of B. However, we need to check if these values satisfy the production capacity constraints:\n\n90 ≤ 100 (True)\n70 ≤ 80 (True)\n\nTherefore, the daily production quantities for A and B that maximize the expected daily profit are 90 units of A and 70 units of B."
