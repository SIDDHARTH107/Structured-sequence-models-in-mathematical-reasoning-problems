Find f(z) if it is analytic on the domain D={z: |z|<10} and satisfies the given equation.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the poles of the integrand function, which are the values of z that make the denominator zero. We have:\n\nz² + 4z + 13 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-B ± √(B² - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nwhere A = 1, B = 4, and C = 13. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nz = (-4 ± √(4² - 4(1)(13))) / 2(1)\nz = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2\nz = -2 ± 3i\n\nSo, the poles of the integrand function are z = -2 + 3i and z = -2 - 3i. Since these poles are not inside the domain D, we can use Cauchy's integral formula to find f(z). Cauchy's integral formula states that:\n\nf(z) = (1 / 2πi) ∫ₐᵇ [(z+3)/(z²+4z+13)]f(z)dz\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values of a and b:\n\nf(z) = (1 / 2πi) ∫₋₁³ [(z+3)/(z²+4z+13)]f(z)dz\n\nSince the integral is equal to f(2), we have:\n\nf(z) = (1 / 2πi) f(2) ∫₋₁³ [(z+3)/(z²+4z+13)]dz\n\nNow, we can find the integral:\n\n∫₋₁³ [(z+3)/(z²+4z+13)]dz = ∫₋₁³ [(z+3)/((z+2)² + 9)]dz\n\nLet's perform a substitution: u = z + 2, then du = dz. The new limits of integration are a = -1 + 2 = 1 and b = 3 + 2 = 5. The integral becomes:\n\n∫₁⁵ [(u-1)/(u² + 9)]du\n\nNow, we can split the integrand into two parts:\n\n∫₁⁵ [(u-1)/(u² + 9)]du = ∫₁⁵ [u/(u² + 9) - 1/(u² + 9)]du\n\nNow, we can integrate each part separately:\n\n∫₁⁵ [u/(u² + 9)]du - ∫₁⁵ [1/(u² + 9)]du\n\nThe first integral can be solved using a simple substitution: v = u² + 9, then dv = 2u du. The new limits of integration are a = 1² + 9 = 10 and b = 5² + 9 = 34. We have:\n\n(1/2)∫₁₀³⁴ [1/v]dv = (1/2)[ln(v)]₁₀³⁴ = (1/2)(ln(34) - ln(10))\n\nThe second integral can be solved using the arctangent function:\n\n∫₁⁵ [1/(u² + 9)]du = (1/3)arctan(u/3) | from 1 to 5 = (1/3)(arctan(5/3) - arctan(1/3))\n\nNow, we can combine the results:\n\nf(z) = (1 / 2πi) f(2) [(1/2)(ln(34) - ln(10)) - (1/3)(arctan(5/3) - arctan(1/3))]\n\nf(z) = (1 / πi) f(2) [ln(√(34/10)) - (1/3)(arctan(5/3) - arctan(1/3))]\n\nThis is the function f(z) that is analytic on the domain D and satisfies the given integral equation."
