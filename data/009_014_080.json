Write a logistic growth model for the population of rabbits and use it to determine how long it will take for the population to reach 80% of its maximum capacity, when it starts with 1000 rabbits.",
    "message_2": "To write a logistic growth model for the population of rabbits, we can use the following equation:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere:\nP(t) is the population at time t\nK is the carrying capacity (maximum sustainable population)\nP0 is the initial population\nr is the growth rate\nt is the time in weeks\n\nIn this problem, we have K = 5000, P0 = 1000, and r = 0.05. We want to find the time t when the population reaches 80% of its maximum capacity, which is 0.8 * 5000 = 4000 rabbits.\n\nSo, we need to solve the equation:\n\n4000 = 5000 / (1 + (5000 - 1000) / 1000 * e^(-0.05*t))\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation:\n\n8/10 = 1 / (1 + 4 * e^(-0.05*t))\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\n1 + 4 * e^(-0.05*t) = 10/8\n4 * e^(-0.05*t) = 2/8\ne^(-0.05*t) = 1/16\n-0.05*t = ln(1/16)\nt = ln(1/16) / -0.05\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nt â‰ˆ 44.36 weeks\n\nSo, it will take approximately 44.36 weeks for the population to reach 80% of its maximum capacity."
