    "message_2": "The deletion-contraction formula states that for a graph G and an edge e, the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n\nwhere G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e (merging the two vertices connected by e and removing any resulting loops).\n\nLet's apply the deletion-contraction formula to the given graph. We will start by considering the edge AB.\n\n1. Deleting edge AB:\n\n```\n    A  B\n    |  |\n    C--D--E\n```\n\n2. Contracting edge AB:\n\n```\n    AB\n    ||\n    C--D--E\n```\n\nNow we have two simpler graphs, and we can apply the deletion-contraction formula again. Let's consider the edge CD for both graphs.\n\nFor the graph obtained by deleting edge AB:\n\n1. Deleting edge CD:\n\n```\n    A  B\n    |  |\n    C  D--E\n```\n\n2. Contracting edge CD:\n\n```\n    A  B\n    |  |\n    CD--E\n```\n\nFor the graph obtained by contracting edge AB:\n\n1. Deleting edge CD:\n\n```\n    AB\n    ||\n    C  D--E\n```\n\n2. Contracting edge CD:\n\n```\n    AB\n    ||\n    CD--E\n```\n\nNow we have four simpler graphs. Notice that the last two graphs are isomorphic, so their chromatic polynomials will be the same. Let's find the chromatic polynomials for each graph.\n\n1. Graph with deleted edges AB and CD:\n\nP₁(k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (since it's a tree with 4 vertices)\n\n2. Graph with contracted edges AB and deleted edge CD:\n\nP₂(k) = k(k-1)^2 (since it's a tree with 3 vertices and one of them has degree 3)\n\n3. Graph with contracted edges AB and CD:\n\nP₃(k) = k(k-1)^2 (since it's isomorphic to the previous graph)\n\nNow we can use the deletion-contraction formula to find the chromatic polynomial of the original graph:\n\nP(G, k) = (P₁(k) - P₂(k)) - (P₃(k) - P₂(k))\nP(G, k) = P₁(k) - P₂(k) - P₃(k) + P₂(k)\nP(G, k) = P₁(k) - P₃(k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) - k(k-1)^2\n\nSo the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) - k(k-1)^2"
