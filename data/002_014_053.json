    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 meters, width of 4 meters, and a height of 6 meters. What is the total surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 8 meters, w = 4 meters, and h = 6 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSA = 2(8)(4) + 2(8)(6) + 2(4)(6)\nSA = 2(32) + 2(48) + 2(24)\nSA = 64 + 96 + 48\nSA = 208\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 square meters."
