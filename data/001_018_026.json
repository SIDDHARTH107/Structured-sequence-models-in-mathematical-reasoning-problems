    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that $\\log_b(a) - \\log_b(c) = \\log_b(\\frac{a}{c})$. Applying this rule to the given expression, we get:\n\n$$\\log_3(27x^6) - \\log_3(9x^2) = \\log_3(\\frac{27x^6}{9x^2})$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction inside the logarithm:\n\n$$\\frac{27x^6}{9x^2} = \\frac{3^3x^6}{3^2x^2}$$\n\nDivide the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor, which is $3^2x^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{3^3x^6}{3^2x^2} = \\frac{3^1x^4}{1} = 3x^4$$\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\n$$\\log_3(3x^4)$$"
