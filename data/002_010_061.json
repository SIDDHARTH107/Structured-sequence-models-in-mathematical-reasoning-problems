    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon, you simply multiply the length of one side by the number of sides. In this case, each side measures 5 meters and there are 6 sides.\n\nPerimeter = (side length) × (number of sides)\nPerimeter = 5 meters × 6\nPerimeter = 30 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the regular hexagon is 30 meters."
