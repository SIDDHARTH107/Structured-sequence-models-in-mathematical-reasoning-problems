    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 500 gallons of water and is being drained continuously. The rate of outflow is given by the equation $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 2\\sqrt{y}$ where $y$ is the amount of water remaining in the tank after $t$ minutes. How long will it take for the tank to be emptied?",
    "message_2": "To find the time it takes for the tank to be emptied, we need to solve the given differential equation and then find the time when the amount of water remaining in the tank, $y$, is zero.\n\nThe given differential equation is separable:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = 2\\sqrt{y}$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{y}} = 2 dt$$\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{y}} = \\int 2 dt$$\n\nThe left side is the integral of $y^{-1/2}$, which is $2y^{1/2} + C_1$. The right side is $2t + C_2$. So we have:\n\n$$2y^{1/2} + C_1 = 2t + C_2$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$$y^{1/2} = t + \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{2}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. We know that at $t=0$, $y=500$. So:\n\n$$500^{1/2} = 0 + \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{2}$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{500} = \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{2}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the time $t$ when $y=0$. So:\n\n$$0 = t + \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{2}$$\n\n$$t = -\\frac{C_2 - C_1}{2}$$\n\nSince we know that $\\sqrt{500} = \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{2}$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n$$t = -\\sqrt{500}$$\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense, as time cannot be negative. Let's go back and check our integration:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{y}} = \\int 2 dt$$\n\nThe left side should be integrated as:\n\n$$\\int y^{-1/2} dy = 2y^{1/2} + C_1$$\n\nAnd the right side:\n\n$$\\int 2 dt = 2t + C_2$$\n\nSo we have:\n\n$$2y^{1/2} = 2t + C_2 - C_1$$\n\nNow, we need to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. We know that at $t=0$, $y=500$. So:\n\n$$2\\sqrt{500} = 0 + C_2 - C_1$$\n\nNow, we want to find the time $t$ when $y=0$. So:\n\n$$0 = 2t + C_2 - C_1$$\n\nSince we know that $2\\sqrt{500} = C_2 - C_1$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n$$0 = 2t + 2\\sqrt{500}$$\n\nNow, solve for $t$:\n\n$$2t = -2\\sqrt{500}$$\n\n$$t = -\\sqrt{500}$$\n\nAgain, this result doesn't make sense, as time cannot be negative. There must be an error in the problem statement or the given differential equation. Please double-check the problem statement and the given differential equation."
