    "message_1": "A message has been encrypted using a simple mono-alphabetic substitution method. If the most frequent letter in the English language (E) appears 260 times in the encrypted message, and the second-most frequent letter (T) appears 170 times, use frequency analysis to determine the possible substitutions for these letters and decipher the message.",
    "message_2": "To perform frequency analysis, we need the encrypted message. However, since the encrypted message is not provided, we can still discuss the general approach to solving this problem.\n\n1. First, analyze the frequency of each letter in the encrypted message. Create a frequency table that lists the letters and their corresponding frequencies.\n\n2. Compare the frequency table of the encrypted message to the known frequency of letters in the English language. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, C, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, and Z.\n\n3. Since E is the most frequent letter in the English language and appears 260 times in the encrypted message, identify the letter in the encrypted message that appears 260 times. This letter is likely the substitution for E.\n\n4. Similarly, find the letter in the encrypted message that appears 170 times. This letter is likely the substitution for T.\n\n5. Continue this process for the other letters in the frequency table, comparing the frequencies in the encrypted message to the known frequencies in the English language.\n\n6. Once you have identified the possible substitutions for each letter, use this information to decipher the encrypted message.\n\nPlease provide the encrypted message to proceed with the frequency analysis and deciphering process."
