    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, you can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × radius²\n\nGiven a radius of 6 cm and a central angle of 45 degrees, we can plug in the values:\n\nArea of sector = (45 / 360) × π × 6²\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × π × 36\n\nArea of sector = 4.5 × π\n\nThe area of the sector is approximately 14.14 square centimeters."
