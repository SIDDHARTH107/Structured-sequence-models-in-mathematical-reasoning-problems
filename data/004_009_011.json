    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * ln(x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions that are being multiplied together. In this case, the two functions are:\n\nu(x) = x^2\nv(x) = ln(x)\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x\nv'(x) = 1/x\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for u(x), v(x), u'(x), and v'(x), we get:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(ln(x)) + (x^2)(1/x)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 2x*ln(x) + x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * ln(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x*ln(x) + x"
