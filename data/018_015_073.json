    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs where the first element is from the first set and the second element is from the second set. \n\nC = A × B = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)}\n\nD = B × A = {(a, 1), (a, 2), (a, 3), (b, 1), (b, 2), (b, 3)}\n\nThe intersection of C and D is the set of all ordered pairs that are present in both C and D. In this case, there are no ordered pairs that are present in both C and D, since the first elements of the pairs in C are from set A, and the first elements of the pairs in D are from set B.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of C and D is the empty set:\n\nC ∩ D = ∅"
