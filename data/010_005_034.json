Is it path-connected? \n\nIf the set is path-connected, find an explicit path between the point $(-1, 1)$ and $(2, 2),$ otherwise prove that no such path exists.",
    "message_2": "The set $A$ is connected because it is the union of two connected sets, namely the graphs of $y = x$ and $y = -x$. Since these two sets have a non-empty intersection (at the origin), their union is connected.\n\nNow, let's check if the set $A$ is path-connected. A set is path-connected if for any two points in the set, there exists a continuous path between them that lies entirely within the set.\n\nConsider the points $(-1, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$ in $A$. We can construct an explicit path between these two points as follows:\n\n1. Start at $(-1, 1)$, which lies on the line $y = -x$.\n2. Move along the line $y = -x$ towards the origin $(0, 0)$.\n3. When reaching the origin, switch to the line $y = x$.\n4. Move along the line $y = x$ towards the point $(2, 2)$.\n\nWe can define this path parametrically as follows:\n\nLet $f: [0, 1] \\to A$ be a function defined by\n\\[f(t) = \\begin{cases}\n(1 - 2t, 1 - 2t) & \\text{if } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{1}{2}, \\\\\n(2t - 1, 2t - 1) & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2} \\leq t \\leq 1.\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nThis function is continuous and maps the interval $[0, 1]$ to $A$, with $f(0) = (-1, 1)$ and $f(1) = (2, 2)$. Thus, the set $A$ is path-connected, and we have found an explicit path between the points $(-1, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$."
