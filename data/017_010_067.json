    "message_2": "There are two isomorphism classes for groups of order 10. These are:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 10, denoted by C10 or Z10.\n2. The dihedral group of order 10, denoted by D5 or D10.\n\nIn each isomorphism class, there is exactly one group (up to isomorphism).\n\nStructural differences between these groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group C10:\n   - It is an abelian group, meaning that the group operation is commutative (i.e., for all elements a, b in the group, a * b = b * a).\n   - It has a single generator, which means that every element in the group can be expressed as a power of the generator.\n   - It has a simple structure, with elements {0, 1, 2, ..., 9} under addition modulo 10.\n\n2. Dihedral group D5:\n   - It is a non-abelian group, meaning that the group operation is not commutative (i.e., there exist elements a, b in the group such that a * b â‰  b * a).\n   - It represents the symmetries of a regular pentagon, including rotations and reflections.\n   - It has a more complex structure, with elements consisting of pairs (r, s), where r represents a rotation and s represents a reflection. The group operation is defined by (r1, s1) * (r2, s2) = (r1 + s1*r2, s1*s2).\n\nIn summary, the two isomorphism classes of groups of order 10 are the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5. The cyclic group is abelian and has a simple structure, while the dihedral group is non-abelian and represents the symmetries of a regular pentagon."
