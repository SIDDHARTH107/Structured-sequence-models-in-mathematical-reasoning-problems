    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - x + 3 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 2x^3, n = 3, so the derivative is (3)(2)x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n2. For the term 5x^2, n = 2, so the derivative is (2)(5)x^(2-1) = 10x.\n3. For the term -x, n = 1, so the derivative is (1)(-1)x^(1-1) = -1.\n4. For the constant term 3, the derivative is 0, since the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x - 1"
