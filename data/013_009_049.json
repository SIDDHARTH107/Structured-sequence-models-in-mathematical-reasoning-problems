    "message_1": "An example problem for a student in Game theory and Matching Pennies is as follows:\n\nSuppose two players A and B play the Matching Pennies game, where each player simultaneously chooses a penny to display either heads or tails. If the pennies match, then player A wins $1 from player B. If the pennies don't match, then player B wins $1 from player A. Suppose the players play this game for 10 rounds. Assume that both players play randomly with equal probability of heads or tails. What is the expected value of the amount of money that player A wins after 10 rounds?",
    "message_2": "In the Matching Pennies game, there are four possible outcomes for each round:\n\n1. Player A chooses heads, and player B chooses heads (HH)\n2. Player A chooses heads, and player B chooses tails (HT)\n3. Player A chooses tails, and player B chooses heads (TH)\n4. Player A chooses tails, and player B chooses tails (TT)\n\nSince both players play randomly with equal probability of heads or tails, each outcome has a probability of 1/4.\n\nPlayer A wins when the pennies match (HH or TT), and player B wins when the pennies don't match (HT or TH). The expected value of a single round for player A is:\n\nE(round) = (1/4 * $1) + (1/4 * -$1) + (1/4 * -$1) + (1/4 * $1) = $0\n\nSince the expected value of a single round is $0, the expected value of the amount of money that player A wins after 10 rounds is:\n\nE(10 rounds) = 10 * E(round) = 10 * $0 = $0"
