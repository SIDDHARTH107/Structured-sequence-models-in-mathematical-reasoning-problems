    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the complex function f(z) = Log(z + 2i) from the upper half-plane to the lower half-plane, we first need to define the principal branch of the logarithm function. The principal branch of the complex logarithm is defined as:\n\nLog(z) = ln|z| + i*Arg(z),\n\nwhere ln is the natural logarithm, |z| is the modulus of z, and Arg(z) is the principal argument of z, which lies in the range (-π, π].\n\nNow, let's consider the function f(z) = Log(z + 2i). We want to find its analytic continuation from the upper half-plane (Im(z) > 0) to the lower half-plane (Im(z) < 0) along the real line.\n\nIn the upper half-plane, the argument of (z + 2i) lies in the range (0, π]. As we move along the real line from the upper half-plane to the lower half-plane, the argument of (z + 2i) will decrease from π to -π. To analytically continue the function, we need to adjust the argument of the logarithm function accordingly.\n\nWhen we reach the lower half-plane, the argument of (z + 2i) will lie in the range (-π, 0). To ensure that the function remains continuous along the real line, we need to add 2π to the argument when we are in the lower half-plane. This is because the argument of the logarithm function should change continuously from π to -π + 2π = π as we move from the upper half-plane to the lower half-plane.\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of f(z) = Log(z + 2i) to the lower half-plane is given by:\n\nf(z) = ln|z + 2i| + i*(Arg(z + 2i) + 2π),\n\nwhere the additional 2π is added to the argument when Im(z) < 0."
