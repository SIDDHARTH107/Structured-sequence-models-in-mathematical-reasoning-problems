    "message_2": "A minimum vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set, and the set has the smallest possible number of vertices.\n\nIn the given graph, we can find a minimum vertex cover by selecting the following vertices: {B, D, F}. This set has 3 vertices, and every edge in the graph is incident to at least one of these vertices.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n- Vertex B covers edges AB, BC, and BD.\n- Vertex D covers edges CD, DE, and DF.\n- Vertex F covers edges EF and FG.\n\nNo smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges in the graph, so {B, D, F} is the minimum vertex cover."
