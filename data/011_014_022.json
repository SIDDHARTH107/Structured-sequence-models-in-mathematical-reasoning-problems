    "message_2": "To find the number of cycles of length 3 in a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the property of the trace of the adjacency matrix.\n\nFirst, let's find the degree sequence of the graph. Since there are 8 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 8 = 16. Let's denote the degrees of the vertices as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and d6. Then, we have:\n\nd1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 16\n\nNow, let's consider the adjacency matrix A of the graph. The trace of A^3 (the matrix A multiplied by itself three times) gives us 6 times the number of cycles of length 3. The trace of A^3 can be computed as the sum of the cubes of the degrees of the vertices divided by 6:\n\ntrace(A^3) = (d1^3 + d2^3 + d3^3 + d4^3 + d5^3 + d6^3) / 6\n\nSince we want to find the number of cycles of length 3, we need to divide the trace of A^3 by 6:\n\nnumber of cycles of length 3 = trace(A^3) / 6\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific graph, we cannot determine the exact degree sequence and thus cannot compute the number of cycles of length 3. The problem does not provide enough information to find a unique solution."
