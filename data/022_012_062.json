    "message_1": "What is the residue of the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z - i) at z = i?\n\nSolution: \n\nThe function f(z) has a simple pole at z = i. To find the residue at z = i, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z=i] = lim_{z -> i} (z - i) f(z)\n\n= lim_{z -> i} (z - i) [(z^3 - 1)/(z - i)]\n\n= lim_{z -> i} [(z + i)(z^2 + iz - 1)]\n\n= i(2i - 1)\n\n= -1 + 2i \n\nTherefore, the residue of f(z) at z = i is -1 + 2i.",
