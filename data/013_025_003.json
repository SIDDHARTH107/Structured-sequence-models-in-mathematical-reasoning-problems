    "message_1": "Suppose two travelers, A and B, lose their identical suitcases at an airport. The airport's lost and found system will reimburse each traveler the cost of the suitcase, but only up to a certain amount, say x dollars. A and B each declare a value for their suitcase and enter it on a claim form. If the difference between the two declared values is d, and A's declared value is a, then A and B are both reimbursed a + (d/2) dollars. \n\nIf x = 100 and A declares a value of 90 dollars, what should B declare as the value of their suitcase in order to maximize their reimbursement?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote B's declared value as b. The difference between the two declared values is d = |a - b|. Since A's declared value is 90 dollars, we have d = |90 - b|. The reimbursement formula is a + (d/2) dollars, which in this case is 90 + (|90 - b|/2) dollars.\n\nTo maximize their reimbursement, B should try to maximize the value of |90 - b|. Since the maximum reimbursement is capped at 100 dollars, B should not declare a value that would result in a reimbursement greater than 100 dollars.\n\nIf B declares a value less than 90 dollars, the reimbursement will be less than 100 dollars, so B should declare a value greater than 90 dollars to maximize their reimbursement.\n\nLet's assume B declares a value of 110 dollars. In this case, d = |90 - 110| = 20, and the reimbursement would be 90 + (20/2) = 100 dollars. This is the maximum reimbursement possible.\n\nTherefore, B should declare a value of 110 dollars to maximize their reimbursement."
