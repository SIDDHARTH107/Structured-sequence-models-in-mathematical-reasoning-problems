    "message_1": "Suppose that the weights of apples in a grocery store are normally distributed with a mean of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. What is the probability that an apple chosen at random weighs between 140 and 160 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that an apple chosen at random weighs between 140 and 160 grams, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the z-scores for 140 grams and 160 grams.\n\nFor 140 grams:\nz1 = (140 - 150) / 20\nz1 = -10 / 20\nz1 = -0.5\n\nFor 160 grams:\nz2 = (160 - 150) / 20\nz2 = 10 / 20\nz2 = 0.5\n\nNow, we'll use the standard normal distribution table to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. \n\nP(z1) = P(z = -0.5) ≈ 0.3085\nP(z2) = P(z = 0.5) ≈ 0.6915\n\nTo find the probability that an apple weighs between 140 and 160 grams, we'll subtract the probability of z1 from the probability of z2:\n\nP(140 < X < 160) = P(z2) - P(z1)\nP(140 < X < 160) = 0.6915 - 0.3085\nP(140 < X < 160) ≈ 0.3830\n\nSo, the probability that an apple chosen at random weighs between 140 and 160 grams is approximately 0.383 or 38.3%."
