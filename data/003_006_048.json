    "message_2": "To find the length of the side opposite the 71° angle using the Law of Sines, we first need to find the third angle of the triangle. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°, we can find the third angle by subtracting the other two angles from 180°:\n\nThird angle = 180° - 42° - 71° = 67°\n\nNow, we can apply the Law of Sines. Let's denote the side opposite the 71° angle as b. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is the same for all three sides of the triangle. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(7.5 cm) / sin(42°) = b / sin(71°)\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb = (7.5 cm * sin(71°)) / sin(42°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nb ≈ (7.5 cm * 0.947) / 0.669\nb ≈ 10.61 cm\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 71° angle is approximately 10.61 cm."
