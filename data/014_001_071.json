    "message_2": "To use RSA encryption, we first need to compute the public and private keys. We are given p=5, q=11, and e=3. Let's compute the necessary values.\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n   n = 5 * 11 = 55\n\n2. Compute the totient function, φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n   φ(55) = (5-1) * (11-1) = 4 * 10 = 40\n\n3. The public key is (n, e) = (55, 3)\n\nNow, we need to find the private key, d, such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1.\n\n4. Calculate d:\n   (3 * d) % 40 = 1\n   We can find d by trying different values, and we find that d = 27 satisfies the equation.\n\n5. The private key is (n, d) = (55, 27)\n\nNow, let's encrypt the message 'MATH'. First, we need to convert each letter to its corresponding numerical value (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26):\n\nM -> 13\nA -> 1\nT -> 20\nH -> 8\n\nNext, we encrypt each numerical value using the public key (n, e) = (55, 3):\n\nCiphertext = (Plaintext^e) % n\n\nFor M (13):\nCiphertext = (13^3) % 55 = 2197 % 55 = 52\n\nFor A (1):\nCiphertext = (1^3) % 55 = 1 % 55 = 1\n\nFor T (20):\nCiphertext = (20^3) % 55 = 8000 % 55 = 45\n\nFor H (8):\nCiphertext = (8^3) % 55 = 512 % 55 = 17\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"52 1 45 17\"."
