    "message_1": "A graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges. Determine if there exists a perfect matching in the graph. If one exists, provide one possible set of edges that forms the perfect matching.",
    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In other words, every vertex is paired with another vertex through an edge, and no vertex is left unpaired.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must have an even number of vertices. Since the given graph has 5 vertices, which is an odd number, it cannot have a perfect matching."
