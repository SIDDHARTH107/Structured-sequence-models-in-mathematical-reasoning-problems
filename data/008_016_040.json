    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the Jacobi iterative method, we first need to rearrange the equations to isolate x and y:\n\nx = (13 - y) / 3\ny = (22 - x) / 4\n\nNow, we will use the initial guesses x_0 = 0 and y_0 = 0 and iterate through the method to find the solution. We will perform 5 iterations to get an approximate solution:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = (13 - 0) / 3 = 13 / 3 = 4.3333\ny_1 = (22 - 0) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = (13 - 5.5) / 3 = 7.5 / 3 = 2.5\ny_2 = (22 - 4.3333) / 4 = 17.6667 / 4 = 4.4167\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 = (13 - 4.4167) / 3 = 8.5833 / 3 = 2.8611\ny_3 = (22 - 2.5) / 4 = 19.5 / 4 = 4.875\n\nIteration 4:\nx_4 = (13 - 4.875) / 3 = 8.125 / 3 = 2.7083\ny_4 = (22 - 2.8611) / 4 = 19.1389 / 4 = 4.7847\n\nIteration 5:\nx_5 = (13 - 4.7847) / 3 = 8.2153 / 3 = 2.7384\ny_5 = (22 - 2.7083) / 4 = 19.2917 / 4 = 4.8229\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the approximate solution is x ≈ 2.7384 and y ≈ 4.8229."
