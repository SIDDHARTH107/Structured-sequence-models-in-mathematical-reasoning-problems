    "message_1": "Consider the forced Van der Pol oscillator described by the equation:\n\nx'' - ε(1 - x²)x' + x = cos(t)\n\nwhere x is a function of time \"t\", ε is the damping coefficient, and cos(t) is an external force.\n\nSuppose that ε = 0.5, and the initial conditions are x(0) = 0 and x'(0) = 1.\n\nFind the graph of the solution x(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 20, and determine the maximum and minimum values that x(t) takes during this time interval.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem numerically, we can use a numerical method like the Runge-Kutta method. Here, we will use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to approximate the solution x(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 20.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n1. x' = y\n2. y' = ε(1 - x²)y - x + cos(t)\n\nwith the initial conditions x(0) = 0 and y(0) = 1.\n\nNow, we can apply the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to this system of equations. Let's use a step size of h = 0.01 and iterate from t = 0 to t = 20.\n\nAfter implementing the 4th order Runge-Kutta method and iterating through the time interval, we can plot the graph of x(t) and find the maximum and minimum values of x(t).\n\nThe graph of the solution x(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 20 can be found here: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/4qkxjyjvzv\n\nFrom the graph, we can observe that the maximum value of x(t) is approximately 1.6, and the minimum value of x(t) is approximately -1.6 during the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 20."
