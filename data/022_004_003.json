    "message_2": "To determine the type and order of singularity at z = 1, we first simplify the function f(z) by factoring the numerator:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 1) / (z - 1) = ((z - 1)(z + 1)) / (z - 1)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the (z - 1) terms:\n\nf(z) = z + 1\n\nSince the function is now simplified and there is no singularity at z = 1, the singularity is removable. The order of a removable singularity is 0."
