Calculate the median weight of the students and then find the median weight after adding an outlier of weight 100 kg. Show that the median is a more robust measure of central tendency compared to the mean.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the median weight of the students, we first need to arrange the weights in ascending order:\n\n55, 56, 62, 64, 65, 68, 70, 80\n\nSince there are 8 students (an even number), the median will be the average of the middle two values. In this case, the middle values are 62 and 64. So, the median weight is:\n\n(62 + 64) / 2 = 126 / 2 = 63 kg\n\nNow, let's add the outlier of 100 kg and find the new median weight:\n\n55, 56, 62, 64, 65, 68, 70, 80, 100\n\nWith 9 students (an odd number), the median will be the middle value, which is 64 kg.\n\nNow, let's compare the median with the mean. First, we calculate the mean weight of the original 8 students:\n\n(62 + 56 + 70 + 65 + 64 + 68 + 55 + 80) / 8 = 520 / 8 = 65 kg\n\nNext, we calculate the mean weight after adding the outlier of 100 kg:\n\n(62 + 56 + 70 + 65 + 64 + 68 + 55 + 80 + 100) / 9 = 620 / 9 â‰ˆ 68.89 kg\n\nAs we can see, the median weight changed only by 1 kg (from 63 kg to 64 kg) after adding the outlier, while the mean weight changed by approximately 3.89 kg (from 65 kg to 68.89 kg). This demonstrates that the median is a more robust measure of central tendency compared to the mean, as it is less affected by extreme values or outliers."
