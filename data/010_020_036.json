Let $\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n$ be a basis for $H_1(F;\\mathbb{Z})$, and let $u_1,\\ldots,u_m$ be the critical points of a Morse function $h:M\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that each critical point $u_i$ is non-degenerate, and that the intersection matrix $A$ given by \n$$A_{ij}=\\#\\{u_k : \\text{ the index of }u_k\\text{ is }j+1 \\text{ and }[\\partial u_k]=\\alpha_i\\}$$\nis invertible. What is the rank of $H_*(\\mathcal{F}(M,F);\\mathbb{Z})$, where $\\mathcal{F}(M,F)$ denotes the space of based maps $u:(F,\\partial F)\\rightarrow (M,F)$ which are Floer trajectories for some metric on $M$ which is compatible with the orientation and such that the energy of $u$ is less than some fixed constant $E$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the rank of $H_*(\\mathcal{F}(M,F);\\mathbb{Z})$, we will use Morse homology. Recall that the Morse complex is generated by the critical points of the Morse function $h$, and the differential is given by counting the number of gradient flow lines between critical points of consecutive indices.\n\nSince the intersection matrix $A$ is invertible, we can use it to relate the number of gradient flow lines between critical points to the homology classes $\\alpha_i$. Specifically, the invertibility of $A$ implies that there is a unique way to express each critical point $u_k$ as a linear combination of the $\\alpha_i$'s. This means that the rank of the Morse complex is equal to the rank of $H_1(F;\\mathbb{Z})$, which is $n$.\n\nNow, consider the space $\\mathcal{F}(M,F)$ of Floer trajectories. The energy condition ensures that the space of trajectories is compact, and the orientation compatibility ensures that the boundary operator is well-defined. Therefore, the Morse homology of the space $\\mathcal{F}(M,F)$ is isomorphic to the singular homology of the space, i.e., $H_*(\\mathcal{F}(M,F);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_*(M;\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nSince the rank of the Morse complex is $n$, and the Morse homology is isomorphic to the singular homology, it follows that the rank of $H_*(\\mathcal{F}(M,F);\\mathbb{Z})$ is also $n$."
