    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinants.\n\nThe main determinant D is:\n\nD = | 2  3 |\n      | 4 -5 |\n\nD = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nNow, we'll find the determinant Dx by replacing the x coefficients with the constants:\n\nDx = | 7  3 |\n         | -9 -5 |\n\nDx = (7 * -5) - (3 * -9) = -35 + 27 = -8\n\nNext, we'll find the determinant Dy by replacing the y coefficients with the constants:\n\nDy = | 2  7 |\n         | 4 -9 |\n\nDy = (2 * -9) - (7 * 4) = -18 - 28 = -46\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = Dx / D = -8 / -22 = 4 / 11\n\ny = Dy / D = -46 / -22 = 23 / 11\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 4/11\ny = 23/11"
