    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve $V$, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to the homogeneous coordinates $x, y, z$ and find the points where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nThe defining equation is $F(x, y, z) = x^2z - y^2 = 0$. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2xz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = -2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = x^2$\n\nNow we need to find the points $(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{P}^2$ where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$2xz = 0$\n\n$-2y = 0$\n\n$x^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now, we have two cases to consider:\n\n1) If $x = 0$, then from the first equation, we have $z = 0$. But this is not possible in projective space, as $(0, 0, 0)$ is not a valid point.\n\n2) If $z = 0$, then from the third equation, we have $x = 0$. So, the only singular point is $(0, 0, 1)$.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the curve $V$ is smooth or not at the singular point $(0, 0, 1)$. A curve is smooth at a point if its tangent space at that point has the same dimension as the curve itself. In this case, the curve $V$ is a one-dimensional curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. \n\nThe tangent space of $V$ at a point $(x, y, z)$ is given by the partial derivatives of the defining equation evaluated at that point:\n\n$T_{(x, y, z)}V = \\left\\{ (u, v, w) \\in \\mathbb{P}^2 : \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x, y, z)u + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x, y, z)v + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}(x, y, z)w = 0 \\right\\}$\n\nLet's evaluate the tangent space at the singular point $(0, 0, 1)$:\n\n$T_{(0, 0, 1)}V = \\left\\{ (u, v, w) \\in \\mathbb{P}^2 : 0u - 0v + 0w = 0 \\right\\}$\n\nThis is the entire projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$, which has dimension 2. Since the tangent space has a higher dimension than the curve itself, the curve $V$ is not smooth at the singular point $(0, 0, 1)$."
