    "message_1": "A certain image has a periodic pattern with a period of 10 pixels. When applying the Fourier transform to this image, the resulting frequency domain representation shows a peak at a frequency of 0.1 cycles/pixels. What is the wavelength of the corresponding pattern in the original image in pixels?",
    "message_2": "The wavelength of a pattern is the inverse of its frequency. In this case, the frequency is given as 0.1 cycles/pixel. To find the wavelength, we simply take the inverse of this value:\n\nWavelength = 1 / Frequency\nWavelength = 1 / 0.1 cycles/pixel\nWavelength = 10 pixels\n\nSo, the wavelength of the corresponding pattern in the original image is 10 pixels."
