    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial and find its roots.\n\nLet's try to find a root by using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0\nSo, x = 1 is a root.\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n  ________________________\n1 |  1  -6   11  -6\n      1  -5   6\n  ________________________\n      1  -5   6   0\n```\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is x^2 - 5x + 6. Now, we can factor this quadratic:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3).\n\nTherefore, the roots of the polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3."
