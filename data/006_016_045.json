    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces electronic chips, and the probability of a defective chip in each batch is 0.05. If a batch contains 1000 chips, what is the probability that the batch will have at least 40 defective chips?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective chips\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of chips (1000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective chips (we want at least 40)\n- p is the probability of a defective chip (0.05)\n\nSince we want the probability of having at least 40 defective chips, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 40, 41, ..., 1000. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(X >= 40) = 1 - P(X < 40) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 39\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability using the binomial formula:\n\nP(X >= 40) = 1 - Σ [C(1000, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 39\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use statistical software or a calculator with a built-in binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the result.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nP(X >= 40) ≈ 0.9648\n\nSo, the probability that the batch will have at least 40 defective chips is approximately 0.9648 or 96.48%."
