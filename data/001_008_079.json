    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 > 7x - 5, we first need to isolate x. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 2x from both sides of the inequality.\n3 > 5x - 5\n\nStep 2: Add 5 to both sides of the inequality.\n8 > 5x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 5.\n8/5 > x\n\nNow, we can write the solution set in interval notation. Since 8/5 > x, the solution set is all values of x less than 8/5. In interval notation, this is written as:\n\n(-âˆž, 8/5)"
