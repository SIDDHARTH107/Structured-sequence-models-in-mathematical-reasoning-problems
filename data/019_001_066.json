    "message_1": "If P represents the statement \"I will study for my math exam\" and Q represents the statement \"I will pass my math exam,\" and it is known that \"If I study for my math exam, then I will pass it,\" what is the truth value of the statement \"If I do not study for my math exam, then I will not pass it?\" (Answer: True)",
    "message_2": "The given statement is \"If I study for my math exam, then I will pass it.\" In logical terms, this can be written as P → Q. \n\nThe statement \"If I do not study for my math exam, then I will not pass it\" can be written as ¬P → ¬Q. \n\nTo find the truth value of this statement, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P. Comparing this with the given statement ¬P → ¬Q, we can see that they are equivalent. Since the original statement \"If I study for my math exam, then I will pass it\" is known to be true, its contrapositive \"If I do not study for my math exam, then I will not pass it\" is also true."
