    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of f(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 5z - 2 in the closed disk D(0,3), we can use the argument principle. The argument principle states that if f(z) is a meromorphic function inside and on a simple closed contour C, and f(z) has no zeros or poles on C, then\n\nΔarg(f(z)) = 2π(N - P),\n\nwhere Δarg(f(z)) is the change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses C, N is the number of zeros of f(z) inside C, and P is the number of poles of f(z) inside C.\n\nIn our case, f(z) is an entire function, so it has no poles. The contour C is the circle |z| = 3. We need to compute the change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses this circle.\n\nParametrize the circle as z = 3e^(it), where t ∈ [0, 2π]. Then, f(z) = (3e^(it))^3 - 4(3e^(it))^2 + 5(3e^(it)) - 2. We can compute the derivative of f(z) with respect to t:\n\ndf/dt = d/dt(27e^(3it) - 36e^(2it) + 15e^(it) - 2) = 81ie^(3it) - 72ie^(2it) + 15ie^(it).\n\nNow, we can compute the change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses the circle:\n\nΔarg(f(z)) = ∫(from 0 to 2π) (df/dt) / f(z) dt = ∫(from 0 to 2π) (81ie^(3it) - 72ie^(2it) + 15ie^(it)) / (27e^(3it) - 36e^(2it) + 15e^(it) - 2) dt.\n\nThis integral is not easy to compute directly, but we can use the fact that f(z) is a polynomial of degree 3. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, f(z) has exactly 3 zeros (counting multiplicities). Since f(z) is entire, these zeros can be anywhere in the complex plane.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that f(0) = -2, f(1) = -2 + 1 + 5 - 2 = 2, and f(2) = 8 - 16 + 10 - 2 = 0. Thus, f(z) has at least one zero in the closed disk D(0,3), namely z = 2. Since f(z) has exactly 3 zeros in total, and at least one of them is in D(0,3), there are either 1, 2, or 3 zeros in D(0,3).\n\nTo determine the exact number of zeros in D(0,3), we can use the fact that f(z) has a zero at z = 2 and perform polynomial division to find the remaining zeros:\n\nf(z) = (z - 2)(z^2 - 2z + 1) = (z - 2)(z - 1)^2.\n\nNow we see that f(z) has a zero of multiplicity 2 at z = 1, which is also in the closed disk D(0,3). Therefore, there are exactly 3 zeros of f(z) in the closed disk D(0,3): one at z = 2 and two at z = 1."
