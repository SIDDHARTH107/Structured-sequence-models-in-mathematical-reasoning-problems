    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the system of equations:\n\n(1) 2x + 3y + iz = 8\n(2) x + 2iy - 3z = 1\n(3) 3ix - 2y + z = -1\n\nNow, let's multiply equation (2) by 2 and subtract equation (1) from the result to eliminate x:\n\n(4) 2(x + 2iy - 3z) - (2x + 3y + iz) = 2(1) - 8\n(4) 4iy - 5z - iz = -6\n\nNow, let's multiply equation (3) by 2i and add it to equation (2) to eliminate y:\n\n(5) (2i)(3ix - 2y + z) + (x + 2iy - 3z) = (2i)(-1) + 1\n(5) -6x + x - 6iz + 2iy + 2iz = -2i + 1\n(5) -5x - 4iz + 2iy = -2i + 1\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables, z and x:\n\n(4) 4iy - 5z - iz = -6\n(5) -5x - 4iz + 2iy = -2i + 1\n\nLet's multiply equation (4) by 4i and add it to equation (5) to eliminate z:\n\n(6) 4i(4iy - 5z - iz) + (-5x - 4iz + 2iy) = 4i(-6) + (-2i + 1)\n(6) -16y + 20iz - 4i^2z - 5x - 4iz + 2iy = -24i - 2i + 1\n(6) -5x - 14y + 16z = 1 - 26i\n\nNow, we have an equation with only x, y, and z:\n\n(6) -5x - 14y + 16z = 1 - 26i\n\nLet's substitute z from equation (4) into equation (6):\n\n-5x - 14y + 16(4iy - 5z - iz) = 1 - 26i\n-5x - 14y + 64iy - 80z - 16iz = 1 - 26i\n\nNow, let's substitute z from equation (5) into the equation above:\n\n-5x - 14y + 64iy - 80(-5x - 4iz + 2iy) - 16iz = 1 - 26i\n-5x - 14y + 64iy + 400x + 320iz - 160iy - 16iz = 1 - 26i\n395x - 14y + 480iz = 1 - 26i\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (1 - 26i + 14y - 480iz) / 395\n\nNow, we can substitute x back into equation (2) and equation (3) to find y and z:\n\n(2) (1 - 26i + 14y - 480iz) / 395 + 2iy - 3z = 1\n(3) 3i(1 - 26i + 14y - 480iz) / 395 - 2y + z = -1\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations for y and z. After solving, we get:\n\nx = 2 + 2i\ny = 1 - i\nz = 1 + 3i\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 2 + 2i\ny = 1 - i\nz = 1 + 3i"
