    "message_2": "To find the number of combinations of players the coach can choose, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of players (12) and k is the number of players in the starting lineup (5).\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!(12-5)!)\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!7!)\n\nC(12, 5) = (12*11*10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(7*6*5*4*3*2*1))\n\nC(12, 5) = (12*11*10*9*8) / (5*4*3*2*1)\n\nC(12, 5) = 95040 / 120\n\nC(12, 5) = 792\n\nSo, the coach can choose 792 different combinations of players for the starting lineup."
