This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A × B) and A. Since A contains single elements and (A × B) contains ordered pairs, their intersection will be an empty set, as there are no common elements between them.\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of B and A.\n\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∩ A).\n\nA × (B ∩ A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∩ A ≠ A × (B ∩ A) since ∅ ≠ {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
