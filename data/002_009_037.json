    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the cylinder?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the height (h) is 8 cm and the radius (r) is 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(4)² + 2π(4)(8)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(16) + 2π(32)\n\nSurface Area = 32π + 64π\n\nSurface Area = 96π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 96 * 3.14\n\nSurface Area ≈ 301.44 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 301.44 cm²."
