    "message_1": "Okay, here's a numerical problem using the Fourier transform:\n\nA signal x(t) has a Fourier transform X(jw) = (2jw)/(jw+4). Use the Fourier transform to determine the response of a system with impulse response h(t) = 2e^(-2t) to x(t).\n\nWhat is the output signal y(t) = h(t) * x(t)?",
    "message_2": "To find the output signal y(t) = h(t) * x(t), we will use the convolution theorem, which states that the convolution of two time-domain signals is equal to the inverse Fourier transform of the product of their Fourier transforms.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t) = 2e^(-2t). The Fourier transform of h(t) is given by:\n\nH(jw) = ∫ h(t) * e^(-jwt) dt\nH(jw) = ∫ 2e^(-2t) * e^(-jwt) dt\n\nNow, let's find the inverse Fourier transform of the product of X(jw) and H(jw):\n\nY(jw) = X(jw) * H(jw)\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier transform, we will use the convolution theorem:\n\ny(t) = F^-1{Y(jw)} = F^-1{X(jw) * H(jw)}\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jw). Since we know the Fourier transforms of x(t) and h(t), we can use the convolution theorem:\n\ny(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫ x(τ) * h(t - τ) dτ\n\nWe know that x(t) has a Fourier transform X(jw) = (2jw)/(jw+4), and h(t) has a Fourier transform H(jw) = 2/(jw+2). Therefore, we can write:\n\ny(t) = ∫ x(τ) * h(t - τ) dτ = ∫ x(τ) * 2e^(-2(t-τ)) dτ\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of X(jw) and H(jw) to find x(τ) and h(t-τ), respectively. The inverse Fourier transform of X(jw) is x(τ) = e^(-4τ) * u(τ), and the inverse Fourier transform of H(jw) is h(t-τ) = 2e^(-2(t-τ)) * u(t-τ).\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the convolution integral:\n\ny(t) = ∫ e^(-4τ) * u(τ) * 2e^(-2(t-τ)) * u(t-τ) dτ\n\nNow, we can solve the convolution integral:\n\ny(t) = 2 ∫ e^(-4τ) * e^(-2(t-τ)) * u(τ) * u(t-τ) dτ\n\nSince u(τ) and u(t-τ) are both unit step functions, the integral will be non-zero only when τ is between 0 and t. Therefore, the limits of the integral are from 0 to t:\n\ny(t) = 2 ∫_0^t e^(-4τ) * e^(-2(t-τ)) dτ\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials and integrate:\n\ny(t) = 2 ∫_0^t e^(-6τ + 2t) dτ\n\nIntegrating with respect to τ, we get:\n\ny(t) = 2 * [-e^(-6τ + 2t) / 6]_0^t\n\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\n\ny(t) = 2 * [-e^(-6t + 2t) / 6 + e^(2t) / 6]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\ny(t) = (1/3) * (e^(2t) - e^(-4t))\n\nSo, the output signal y(t) = h(t) * x(t) is given by:\n\ny(t) = (1/3) * (e^(2t) - e^(-4t))"
