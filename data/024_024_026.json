    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartan connection of the manifold M at point P, we first need to find the coordinate system that is adapted to the sphere. Let's use the spherical coordinate system (r, θ, φ), where r is the radial distance, θ is the polar angle, and φ is the azimuthal angle. The sphere with radius 5 units can be represented as:\n\nr = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the basis vectors for the tangent space at point P. In spherical coordinates, the basis vectors are given by the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to the coordinates:\n\ne_r = ∂(r, θ, φ)/∂r = (1, 0, 0)\ne_θ = ∂(r, θ, φ)/∂θ = (0, 5, 0)\ne_φ = ∂(r, θ, φ)/∂φ = (0, 0, 5sinθ)\n\nSince the tangent space at P is spanned by the vectors v1 = (1, 0, 0) and v2 = (0, 1, 0), we can see that v1 corresponds to e_r and v2 corresponds to e_θ/5. Thus, the tangent space is spanned by e_r and e_θ/5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Cartan connection. The Cartan connection is a 1-form that takes values in the Lie algebra of the rotation group SO(3). It can be represented as a matrix of differential 1-forms:\n\nω = (ω^i_j)\n\nThe Cartan connection is related to the Christoffel symbols of the manifold by the following equation:\n\nω^i_j = Γ^i_jk dx^k\n\nFor a sphere, the non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n\nΓ^r_θθ = -r\nΓ^r_φφ = -r sin^2(θ)\nΓ^θ_rθ = Γ^θ_θr = 1/r\nΓ^θ_φφ = -sin(θ)cos(θ)\nΓ^φ_rφ = Γ^φ_φr = 1/r\nΓ^φ_θφ = Γ^φ_φθ = cot(θ)\n\nNow, we can calculate the Cartan connection components:\n\nω^r_θ = Γ^r_θθ dθ = -5 dθ\nω^r_φ = Γ^r_φφ dφ = -5 sin^2(θ) dφ\nω^θ_r = Γ^θ_rθ dr = 1/5 dr\nω^θ_φ = Γ^θ_φφ dφ = -sin(θ)cos(θ) dφ\nω^φ_r = Γ^φ_rφ dr = 1/5 dr\nω^φ_θ = Γ^φ_θφ dθ = cot(θ) dθ\n\nThe other components of the Cartan connection are zero. Thus, the Cartan connection of the manifold M at point P is given by the matrix:\n\nω = |  0    -5 dθ          -5 sin^2(θ) dφ  |\n      | 1/5 dr    0         -sin(θ)cos(θ) dφ |\n      | 1/5 dr  cot(θ) dθ          0            |"
