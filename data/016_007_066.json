    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal created by iteratively removing cubes from the initial cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole structure are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes in each iteration.\n\nIn the 4th iteration of the Menger sponge, the total number of cubes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^iteration\n\nFor the 4th iteration:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^4 = 160,000\n\nSo, there are 160,000 cubes in the 4th iteration of the Menger sponge."
