    "message_1": "In a market, 40% of the consumers prefer to buy product A, 30% prefer to buy product B, and the rest buy product C. If you randomly select 50 consumers from the market, what is the probability that exactly 20 of them will prefer to buy product A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, selecting k consumers who prefer product A) in n trials (selecting n consumers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability that a consumer prefers product A, which is 40% or 0.4)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, selecting 50 consumers)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, selecting 20 consumers who prefer product A)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 20) = C(50, 20) * 0.4^20 * (1-0.4)^(50-20)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(50, 20):\n\nC(50, 20) = 50! / (20! * (50-20)!)\nC(50, 20) = 50! / (20! * 30!)\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.4^20 and (1-0.4)^(50-20):\n\n0.4^20 ≈ 1.0995 * 10^(-6)\n(1-0.4)^(50-20) = 0.6^30 ≈ 2.5820 * 10^(-6)\n\nNow, let's multiply all these values:\n\nP(X = 20) ≈ C(50, 20) * 1.0995 * 10^(-6) * 2.5820 * 10^(-6)\n\nTo calculate C(50, 20), you can use a calculator or an online tool:\n\nC(50, 20) ≈ 47129212243960\n\nNow, multiply all the values:\n\nP(X = 20) ≈ 47129212243960 * 1.0995 * 10^(-6) * 2.5820 * 10^(-6)\nP(X = 20) ≈ 0.1412\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 20 of the 50 randomly selected consumers will prefer to buy product A is approximately 14.12%."
