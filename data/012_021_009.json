    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given undirected graph, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the set of bags containing v forms a connected subtree.\n\nWe can find a tree decomposition for the given graph as follows:\n\n1. Bag 1: {A, B, D}\n2. Bag 2: {B, C, D}\n3. Bag 3: {C, D, E}\n4. Bag 4: {D, E, F}\n5. Bag 5: {E, F, G}\n\nThe tree decomposition can be visualized as a tree with Bag 1 connected to Bag 2, Bag 2 connected to Bag 3, Bag 3 connected to Bag 4, and Bag 4 connected to Bag 5.\n\nNow, the treewidth of the graph is the size of the largest bag in the tree decomposition minus one. In this case, all bags have 3 vertices, so the treewidth is 3 - 1 = 2."
