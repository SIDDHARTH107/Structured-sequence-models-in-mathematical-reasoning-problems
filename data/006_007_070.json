    "message_1": "Assuming that the probability of a certain stock price increase is 0.6 and the probability of a decrease is 0.4, what is the probability that the stock price will neither increase nor decrease tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we are given the probability of a stock price increase (0.6) and the probability of a decrease (0.4). Since the stock price can either increase, decrease, or remain the same, the sum of these probabilities should be equal to 1.\n\nLet P(neither) be the probability that the stock price will neither increase nor decrease tomorrow. We can represent this using the following equation:\n\nP(increase) + P(decrease) + P(neither) = 1\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n\n0.6 + 0.4 + P(neither) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for P(neither):\n\nP(neither) = 1 - (0.6 + 0.4)\nP(neither) = 1 - 1\nP(neither) = 0\n\nTherefore, the probability that the stock price will neither increase nor decrease tomorrow is 0."
