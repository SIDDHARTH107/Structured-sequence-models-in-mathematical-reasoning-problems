    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(2x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x = 6\n\nNow, divide by 3 to solve for x:\n\nx = 6 / 3\n\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + y = 5\n\n2(2) + y = 5\n\n4 + y = 5\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\ny = 1\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = 2 and y = 1."
