    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products A and B. The production of one unit of A requires 3 units of raw material and 4 hours of labor. The production of one unit of B requires 6 units of raw material and 6 hours of labor. The company has 180 units of raw material and 240 hours of labor available per day. Find the maximum number of units of each product that the company can produce per day, given that the profit for one unit of A is $20 and for one unit of B is $30.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for raw materials and labor can be written as:\n\n3x + 6y ≤ 180 (raw material constraint)\n4x + 6y ≤ 240 (labor constraint)\n\nWe can simplify these inequalities:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 60\n2x + 3y ≤ 120\n\nNow we need to find the maximum profit, which is given by the equation:\n\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nWe will use the graphical method to find the feasible region and the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we find the boundary points of the feasible region by solving the simplified inequalities:\n\n1. x + 2y = 60\n   x = 0 => y = 30\n   y = 0 => x = 60\n\n2. 2x + 3y = 120\n   x = 0 => y = 40\n   y = 0 => x = 60\n\nNow we plot these points and the inequalities on a graph:\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (60, 0), and (40, 20).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 30) = 20(0) + 30(30) = $900\n3. P(60, 0) = 20(60) + 30(0) = $1200\n4. P(40, 20) = 20(40) + 30(20) = $1400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (40, 20), which corresponds to producing 40 units of product A and 20 units of product B. The maximum profit is $1400 per day."
