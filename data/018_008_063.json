Find the number of elements in the Cartesian product of set A and set B, then swap the order of the sets and find the number of elements in the Cartesian product of set B and set A. Show that the two products are not equal, proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "Let set A = {a1, a2, a3} and set B = {b1, b2, b3, b4}. The Cartesian product of set A and set B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nA x B = {(a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a1, b3), (a1, b4), (a2, b1), (a2, b2), (a2, b3), (a2, b4), (a3, b1), (a3, b2), (a3, b3), (a3, b4)}\n\nThere are 12 elements in A x B.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of set B and set A, denoted as B x A.\n\nB x A = {(b1, a1), (b1, a2), (b1, a3), (b2, a1), (b2, a2), (b2, a3), (b3, a1), (b3, a2), (b3, a3), (b4, a1), (b4, a2), (b4, a3)}\n\nThere are 12 elements in B x A.\n\nAlthough the number of elements in A x B and B x A are the same, the actual elements themselves are different. For example, (a1, b1) is an element of A x B, but not an element of B x A. Similarly, (b1, a1) is an element of B x A, but not an element of A x B.\n\nSince A x B and B x A have different elements, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
