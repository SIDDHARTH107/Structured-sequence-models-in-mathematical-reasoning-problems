    "message_1": "A student is flipping a fair coin. What is the probability that the coin will land heads up exactly 3 times in a row out of 10 flips?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in a row in 10 flips. We can break this down into different cases where the 3 heads in a row can occur.\n\nCase 1: HHH at the beginning (HHHTxxxxxx)\nThere are 7 remaining flips, each with 2 possible outcomes (H or T), so there are 2^7 = 128 possible sequences in this case.\n\nCase 2: HHH starts at the 2nd flip (THHHTxxxxx)\nThere are 6 remaining flips, each with 2 possible outcomes, so there are 2^6 = 64 possible sequences in this case.\n\nCase 3: HHH starts at the 3rd flip (TTHHHTxxxx)\nThere are 5 remaining flips, each with 2 possible outcomes, so there are 2^5 = 32 possible sequences in this case.\n\nCase 4: HHH starts at the 4th flip (TTTHHHTxxx)\nThere are 4 remaining flips, each with 2 possible outcomes, so there are 2^4 = 16 possible sequences in this case.\n\nCase 5: HHH starts at the 5th flip (TTTTHHHTxx)\nThere are 3 remaining flips, each with 2 possible outcomes, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible sequences in this case.\n\nCase 6: HHH starts at the 6th flip (TTTTTHHHTx)\nThere are 2 remaining flips, each with 2 possible outcomes, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible sequences in this case.\n\nCase 7: HHH starts at the 7th flip (TTTTTTHHHT)\nThere is 1 remaining flip, with 2 possible outcomes, so there are 2^1 = 2 possible sequences in this case.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of possible sequences of 10 coin flips. There are 2 possible outcomes for each flip, so there are 2^10 = 1024 possible sequences.\n\nTo find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in a row in 10 flips, we divide the number of successful sequences by the total number of possible sequences:\n\n(128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 1024 = 254 / 1024 â‰ˆ 0.248\n\nSo the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in a row in 10 flips is approximately 0.248 or 24.8%."
