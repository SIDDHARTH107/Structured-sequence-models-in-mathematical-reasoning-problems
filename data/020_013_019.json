    "message_2": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems I misunderstood your question. You are looking to solve a linear programming problem, not a semi-definite programming problem. Semi-definite programming deals with optimizing over symmetric, positive semi-definite matrices, which is not applicable here.\n\nTo solve the given linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method. First, let's rewrite the constraints as follows:\n\n1. x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> ≤ 6\n2. 2x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub> ≤ 4\n3. x<sub>1</sub> ≥ 0\n4. x<sub>2</sub> ≥ 0\n\nNow, let's find the feasible region by plotting these constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x<sub>2</sub> ≤ 6 - x<sub>1</sub>\n2. x<sub>2</sub> ≥ 2x<sub>1</sub> - 4\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the quadrilateral with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 4), and (4, 2).\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of the objective function 3x<sub>1</sub> + 5x<sub>2</sub> within this feasible region. We can do this by evaluating the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. At (0, 0): 3(0) + 5(0) = 0\n2. At (0, 4): 3(0) + 5(4) = 20\n3. At (2, 4): 3(2) + 5(4) = 26\n4. At (4, 2): 3(4) + 5(2) = 22\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function within the feasible region is 26, which occurs at the point (2, 4)."
