    "message_1": "A company produces bolts with an average length of 10 mm and a standard deviation of 0.5 mm. However, a machine error caused some bolts to become longer than the usual ones. To detect the outliers, the quality control team decided to remove all bolts that are longer than 11 mm. If a sample of 100 bolts is taken, what is the probability that at least one bolt is removed as an outlier?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the normal distribution and the complement rule. \n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of a single bolt being longer than 11 mm. We can standardize the value by finding the z-score:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\nz = (11 - 10) / 0.5\nz = 2\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a single bolt being longer than 11 mm using the z-score and the standard normal distribution table or calculator. The probability of a bolt being shorter than 11 mm is P(Z < 2) ≈ 0.9772. Therefore, the probability of a single bolt being longer than 11 mm is:\n\nP(Z > 2) = 1 - P(Z < 2) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that at least one bolt out of 100 is removed as an outlier. We can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring:\n\nP(at least one bolt removed) = 1 - P(no bolts removed)\n\nThe probability of a single bolt not being removed is the complement of the probability of a single bolt being removed:\n\nP(not removed) = 1 - P(removed) = 1 - 0.0228 = 0.9772\n\nNow, we can find the probability of all 100 bolts not being removed:\n\nP(all 100 bolts not removed) = (0.9772)^100 ≈ 0.0407\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least one bolt being removed:\n\nP(at least one bolt removed) = 1 - P(all 100 bolts not removed) = 1 - 0.0407 ≈ 0.9593\n\nSo, there is approximately a 95.93% chance that at least one bolt will be removed as an outlier in a sample of 100 bolts."
