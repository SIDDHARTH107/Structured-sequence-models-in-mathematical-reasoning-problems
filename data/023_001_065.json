    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx\n\nSince the function f(x) = x is an odd function, its integral over a symmetric interval around the origin will be zero. Therefore, a_0 = 0.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(n * x) dx\n\nAgain, since the product of an odd function (x) and an even function (cos(n * x)) is an odd function, the integral over a symmetric interval around the origin will be zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find the coefficients b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = u*v - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫(-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * sin(n * π) - (1/n^2) * sin(n * (-π))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 and sin(n * (-π)) = 0 for all integer values of n, we get:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [0 * cos(n * x) + 0 * sin(n * x)]\n\nThis means that the Fourier series of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is identically zero, which is not possible. The reason for this discrepancy is that the function f(x) = x is not periodic on the interval [-π, π]. To make it periodic, we can define a new function g(x) = x - 2πk, where k is an integer such that g(x) is periodic on the interval [-π, π]. Then, we can find the Fourier series of g(x) instead."
