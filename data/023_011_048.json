    "message_2": "To find the frequency components of the output signal y(t), we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal x(t) is given by:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nwhere X(f) is the Fourier transform of x(t), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the output signal y(t) using trigonometric identities:\n\ny(t) = 2sin(2πt+π/4) + 3sin(4πt) + 4cos(6πt)\n     = 2[sin(2πt)cos(π/4) + cos(2πt)sin(π/4)] + 3sin(4πt) + 4cos(6πt)\n     = √2[sin(2πt) + cos(2πt)] + 3sin(4πt) + 4cos(6πt)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of each term in y(t):\n\n1. For sin(2πt):\n\nF{sin(2πt)} = ∫[sin(2πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n             = (1/2j)[δ(f - 1) - δ(f + 1)]\n\n2. For cos(2πt):\n\nF{cos(2πt)} = ∫[cos(2πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n             = (1/2)[δ(f - 1) + δ(f + 1)]\n\n3. For sin(4πt):\n\nF{sin(4πt)} = ∫[sin(4πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n             = (1/2j)[δ(f - 2) - δ(f + 2)]\n\n4. For cos(6πt):\n\nF{cos(6πt)} = ∫[cos(6πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n             = (1/2)[δ(f - 3) + δ(f + 3)]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of y(t) by combining the Fourier transforms of each term:\n\nY(f) = √2[(1/2j)[δ(f - 1) - δ(f + 1)] + (1/2)[δ(f - 1) + δ(f + 1)]] + 3(1/2j)[δ(f - 2) - δ(f + 2)] + 4(1/2)[δ(f - 3) + δ(f + 3)]\n\nThe frequency components of the output signal y(t) are:\n\n1. A component at f = ±1 with amplitude √2/2 (from sin(2πt) and cos(2πt))\n2. A component at f = ±2 with amplitude 3/2 (from sin(4πt))\n3. A component at f = ±3 with amplitude 4/2 (from cos(6πt))\n\nSo, the frequency components of y(t) are at f = ±1, ±2, and ±3 with amplitudes √2/2, 3/2, and 4/2, respectively."
