    "message_2": "First, we want to isolate the sin(2x) term:\n\nsin(2x) = (√3 - 1) / 2\n\nNow, we want to find the value of x. To do this, we will take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\n2x = arcsin((√3 - 1) / 2)\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = (1/2) * arcsin((√3 - 1) / 2)\n\nThis gives us the principal value of x. However, since the sine function is periodic, there are infinitely many solutions for x. To find the general solution, we can add multiples of the sine function's period, which is 2π for sin(2x) and π for x:\n\nx = (1/2) * arcsin((√3 - 1) / 2) + nπ\n\nwhere n is an integer."
