    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we will divide each of these determinants by D to get the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2  3  4 |\n| 5  6  7 |\n| 8  9 10 |\n\nTo find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D):\nD = 2(6*10 - 7*9) - 3(5*10 - 7*8) + 4(5*9 - 6*8)\nD = 2(60 - 63) - 3(50 - 56) + 4(45 - 48)\nD = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 4(-3)\nD = -6 + 18 - 12\nD = 0\n\nSince the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D) is 0, Cramer's rule cannot be applied to this system of linear equations. This means that the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions."
