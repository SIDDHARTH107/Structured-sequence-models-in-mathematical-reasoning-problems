    "message_1": "A container of water is being filled at a rate of 5 cubic meters per hour. The container has a height of 10 meters and a radius of 5 meters. Assuming the water in the container is incompressible and that the flow of water out is negligible, use the Navier-Stokes equations to find the velocity at the bottom of the container when the water has reached a height of 8 meters.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Bernoulli's equation, which is a simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible and steady flow. The Bernoulli's equation states that the sum of pressure, kinetic, and potential energy per unit volume is constant along a streamline. \n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the water in the container when it reaches a height of 8 meters:\n\nV = πr²h\nV = π(5m)²(8m)\nV = 200π m³\n\nNow, let's find the flow rate in meters per second:\n\nFlow rate = 5 m³/hour * (1 hour / 3600 seconds)\nFlow rate = 5/3600 m³/s ≈ 0.001389 m³/s\n\nNext, we can find the area of the container's base:\n\nA = πr²\nA = π(5m)²\nA = 25π m²\n\nNow, we can find the average velocity of the water entering the container:\n\nv_in = Flow rate / A\nv_in = 0.001389 m³/s / 25π m² ≈ 1.77 x 10^(-5) m/s\n\nSince the flow is steady, the velocity of the water at the bottom of the container (v_out) will be the same as the average velocity of the water entering the container. Therefore, the velocity at the bottom of the container when the water has reached a height of 8 meters is approximately 1.77 x 10^(-5) m/s."
