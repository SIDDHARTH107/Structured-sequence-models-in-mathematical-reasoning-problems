    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (i.e., isomorphisms from the graph to itself). In other words, it is the set of all possible ways to relabel the vertices of the graph such that the adjacency relations are preserved.\n\nFor the given graph, we can identify the following automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which leaves all vertices unchanged: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)\n2. Swapping vertices 1 and 3: (13)(2)(4)(5)\n3. Swapping vertices 4 and 5: (1)(2)(3)(45)\n4. Swapping both 1 and 3, and 4 and 5: (13)(2)(45)\n\nThese are the only automorphisms that preserve the adjacency relations in the graph. Therefore, the order of the automorphism group of this graph is 4."
