    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 32, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. The order of the group is 32, which is 2^5. According to the theorem, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order. So, we need to find all possible partitions of the exponent 5.\n\nThe partitions of 5 are:\n1. 5\n2. 4 + 1\n3. 3 + 2\n4. 3 + 1 + 1\n5. 2 + 2 + 1\n6. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n7. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nNow, we will list the corresponding abelian groups for each partition:\n\n1. Z_32 (cyclic group of order 32)\n2. Z_16 x Z_2\n3. Z_8 x Z_4\n4. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2\n5. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2\n6. Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n7. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n\nThese are the 7 isomorphism classes of abelian groups of order 32.\n\nNow, we need to consider non-abelian groups. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of non-abelian groups of order 32. In particular, we will look at the 2-Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet G be a non-abelian group of order 32, and let n_2 be the number of 2-Sylow subgroups of G. By Sylow's third theorem, n_2 must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility for n_2 is 1, which means that G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, say P, of order 32. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we can consider the quotient group G/P.\n\nHowever, G/P is trivial, so G is itself a 2-group. By the Burnside's theorem, every group of order 2^5 has a normal subgroup of order 2^4. Let N be such a normal subgroup of G. Then G/N is a group of order 2, which is cyclic. Therefore, G is an extension of Z_2 by N.\n\nNow, we will use the fact that the automorphism group of a direct sum of cyclic groups is a direct product of their automorphism groups. In particular, we have:\n\n1. Aut(Z_16 x Z_2) = Aut(Z_16) x Aut(Z_2) = Z_8 x Z_1\n2. Aut(Z_8 x Z_4) = Aut(Z_8) x Aut(Z_4) = Z_2 x Z_2\n3. Aut(Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2) = Aut(Z_4) x Aut(Z_4) x Aut(Z_2) = Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_1\n\nWe can see that the automorphism group of N has order 8, 4, or 4. In each case, there is a unique non-abelian extension of Z_2 by N, which we can denote by G_1, G_2, and G_3.\n\nThus, there are 3 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 32: G_1, G_2, and G_3.\n\nIn total, there are 7 isomorphism classes of abelian groups and 3 isomorphism classes of non-abelian groups, making a total of 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
