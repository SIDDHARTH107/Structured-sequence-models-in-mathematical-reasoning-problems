    "message_2": "To find the expected number of defective products each day, we can multiply the total number of units produced daily by the probability of a product being defective.\n\nExpected number of defective products = Total units produced daily × Probability of a defective product\n= 5000 × 0.002\n= 10\n\nThe company should expect to produce 10 defective products each day due to this type of defect."
