D_8: The dihedral group of order 16.\n7. Q_16: The quaternion group of order 16.\n8. Z_4 ⋊ Z_4: The semidirect product of two cyclic groups of order 4.\n9.

Z_4 ⋊ Z_2 × Z_2: The semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 4 and the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2.\n12. (Z_2 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_4: The semidirect product of the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n13. D_4 × Z_2: The direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n14. (Z_4 × Z_4) ⋊ Z_2: The semidirect product of the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nTo show that each of these classes corresponds to a unique group up to isomorphism, we can use the following facts:\n\n- Two groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same order and the same number of elements of each order.\n- The direct product of two groups is isomorphic to the direct product of their isomorphic groups.\n- The semidirect product of two groups is isomorphic to the semidirect product of their isomorphic groups.\n\nBy examining the structure of each group and the orders of their elements, we can see that no two groups in the list above have the same number of elements of each order, and thus they are not isomorphic to each other. Therefore, each isomorphism class corresponds to a unique group up to isomorphism."
