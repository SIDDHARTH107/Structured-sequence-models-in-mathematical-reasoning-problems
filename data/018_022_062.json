    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of (A-B) x B and B x (A-B). Show that the symmetric difference of (A-B) x B and B x (A-B) is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the sets (A-B) and (B-A):\n\n(A-B) = {x ∈ A | x ∉ B} = {1}\n(B-A) = {x ∈ B | x ∉ A} = {4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products (A-B) x B and B x (A-B):\n\n(A-B) x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)}\nB x (A-B) = {(2,1), (3,1), (4,1)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A-B) x B and B x (A-B):\n\nSymmetric difference is the set of elements which are in one of the sets, but not in both. In this case:\n\n((A-B) x B) Δ (B x (A-B)) = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is commutative with respect to Cartesian product:\n\nThe Cartesian product of the symmetric differences is:\n\n((A-B) Δ B) x (B Δ (A-B)) = {1} x {4} = {(1,4)}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of (A-B) x B and B x (A-B) is not equal to the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences ((A-B) Δ B) x (B Δ (A-B)). Therefore, the symmetric difference is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product."
