    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of the given signal F(w) = e^(-2|w|)/(1 + w^2), we need to compute the following integral:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[F(w) * e^(iwt)] dw, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nHowever, this integral is quite difficult to compute directly. Instead, we can use the convolution theorem, which states that the inverse Fourier transform of a product of two functions is the convolution of the inverse Fourier transforms of the individual functions.\n\nLet's rewrite F(w) as a product of two functions:\n\nF(w) = G(w) * H(w), where G(w) = e^(-2|w|) and H(w) = 1/(1 + w^2).\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transforms of G(w) and H(w):\n\ng(t) = inverse Fourier transform of G(w) = (1/π) * e^(-2|t|)\nh(t) = inverse Fourier transform of H(w) = (1/π) * e^(-|t|)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of F(w) by convolving g(t) and h(t):\n\nf(t) = g(t) * h(t) = ∫[g(τ) * h(t - τ)] dτ, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nf(t) = (1/π^2) * ∫[e^(-2|τ|) * e^(-|t - τ|)] dτ\n\nTo compute this integral, we need to consider two cases: τ < t and τ > t.\n\nCase 1: τ < t\nf1(t) = (1/π^2) * ∫[e^(-2τ) * e^(-t + τ)] dτ, where the integral is taken from -∞ to t.\nf1(t) = (1/π^2) * ∫[e^(-t - τ)] dτ\n\nCase 2: τ > t\nf2(t) = (1/π^2) * ∫[e^(-2τ) * e^(t - τ)] dτ, where the integral is taken from t to +∞.\nf2(t) = (1/π^2) * ∫[e^(-t - τ)] dτ\n\nNow, we can find f(t) by adding f1(t) and f2(t):\n\nf(t) = f1(t) + f2(t) = (1/π^2) * ∫[e^(-t - τ)] dτ, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nf(t) = (1/π^2) * [e^(-t - τ)] / (-1) | from -∞ to +∞\n\nf(t) = (1/π^2) * [e^(-t - ∞) - e^(-t - (-∞))]\n\nf(t) = (1/π^2) * [0 - e^(-t + ∞)]\n\nf(t) = (1/π^2) * e^(-t)\n\nSo, the inverse Fourier transform of the given signal F(w) = e^(-2|w|)/(1 + w^2) is:\n\nf(t) = (1/π^2) * e^(-t)"
