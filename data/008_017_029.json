    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  4  6 |\n    | 3  5  7 |\n    | 4  6  8 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 10 |\n    | 12 |\n    | 15 |\n\nNow, we need to find the sparse representation of the matrix A. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the given matrix A does not have any zero elements, so we cannot represent it as a sparse matrix. \n\nSince we cannot represent the given matrix A as a sparse matrix, we cannot solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices. However, we can still solve the system using other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule."
