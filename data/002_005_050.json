    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 10 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (d) is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h):\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nIn this case, the length (l) is 8 cm, the width (w) is 10 cm, and the height (h) is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √(8² + 10² + 6²)\nd = √(64 + 100 + 36)\nd = √200\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √200 cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
