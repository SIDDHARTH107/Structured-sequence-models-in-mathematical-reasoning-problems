    "message_2": "To find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 108 and 192, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (192) by the smaller number (108) and find the remainder.\n   192 รท 108 = 1 (remainder 84)\n\n2. Replace the larger number (192) with the smaller number (108) and the smaller number with the remainder (84).\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 108 and 84.\n\n3. Divide 108 by 84.\n   108 รท 84 = 1 (remainder 24)\n\n4. Replace 108 with 84 and 84 with 24.\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 84 and 24.\n\n5. Divide 84 by 24.\n   84 รท 24 = 3 (remainder 12)\n\n6. Replace 84 with 24 and 24 with 12.\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 24 and 12.\n\n7. Divide 24 by 12.\n   24 รท 12 = 2 (remainder 0)\n\nSince the remainder is 0, we have found the GCD. The GCD of 108 and 192 is 12."
