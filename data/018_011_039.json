The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and {5}. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\n(A ∩ B) × {5} = {(2, 5), (3, 5)}"
