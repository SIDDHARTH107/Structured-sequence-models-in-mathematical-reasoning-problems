    "message_1": "A factory producing toys has a machine that can create either a red toy and a green toy or two blue toys at each operation. If the factory has no toys initially, write a recurrence relation for the number of ways to produce $n$ toys such that there are twice as many blue toys as green toys. Find the number of ways to produce 8 toys using this relation.",
    "message_2": "Let $a_n$ be the number of ways to produce $n$ toys such that there are twice as many blue toys as green toys. We can derive a recurrence relation for $a_n$ by considering the last operation of the machine.\n\n1. If the last operation produces a red toy and a green toy, then there must be $n-2$ toys before this operation, with twice as many blue toys as green toys. There are $a_{n-2}$ ways to achieve this.\n\n2. If the last operation produces two blue toys, then there must be $n-2$ toys before this operation, with twice as many blue toys as green toys plus one. Let $b_n$ be the number of ways to produce $n$ toys such that there are twice as many blue toys as green toys plus one. Then there are $b_{n-2}$ ways to achieve this.\n\nThus, we have the recurrence relation $a_n = a_{n-2} + b_{n-2}$.\n\nNow, we need to find a recurrence relation for $b_n$. If the last operation produces a red toy and a green toy, then there must be $n-2$ toys before this operation, with twice as many blue toys as green toys plus one. There are $b_{n-2}$ ways to achieve this.\n\nTherefore, we have the recurrence relation $b_n = b_{n-2}$.\n\nWe can now find the base cases for $a_n$ and $b_n$. Since we need at least one green toy and two blue toys, the minimum value of $n$ is 3. Thus, we have:\n\n- $a_3 = 0$ (it's impossible to have twice as many blue toys as green toys with only 3 toys)\n- $a_4 = 1$ (2 blue toys and 1 green toy with 1 red toy)\n- $b_3 = 1$ (2 blue toys and 1 green toy)\n- $b_4 = 0$ (it's impossible to have twice as many blue toys as green toys plus one with only 4 toys)\n\nNow, we can use the recurrence relations to find $a_8$:\n\n- $a_5 = a_3 + b_3 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n- $a_6 = a_4 + b_4 = 1 + 0 = 1$\n- $a_7 = a_5 + b_5 = 1 + b_3 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n- $a_8 = a_6 + b_6 = 1 + b_4 = 1 + 0 = 1$\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 way to produce 8 toys such that there are twice as many blue toys as green toys."
