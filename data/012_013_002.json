    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial for the graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction formula. The deletion-contraction formula states that for any graph G and edge e, the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) can be found using the formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n\nwhere G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nLet's apply the formula to the graph G:\n\n1. Choose edge AB. The graph G - AB is the same as G since there is an edge X connecting A and B. The graph G/AB is obtained by merging vertices A and B into a single vertex, say AB, and removing any duplicate edges. The resulting graph is a triangle with vertices AB, C, and D.\n\n2. Calculate the chromatic polynomial for G/AB:\nP(G/AB, k) = P(triangle, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)\n\n3. Now, we can find the chromatic polynomial for G:\nP(G, k) = P(G - AB, k) - P(G/AB, k) = P(G, k) - k(k-1)(k-2)\n\nHowever, this equation is not helpful since we have P(G, k) on both sides. Instead, let's choose a different edge to apply the deletion-contraction formula. Let's choose edge X.\n\n4. The graph G - X is obtained by removing the edge X, and the graph G/X is obtained by merging vertices A and B into a single vertex, say AB, and vertices C and D into a single vertex, say CD, and removing any duplicate edges. The resulting graph is a square with vertices AB, CD, and two non-adjacent vertices.\n\n5. Calculate the chromatic polynomial for G/X:\nP(G/X, k) = P(square, k) = k(k-1)^2\n\n6. Now, we can find the chromatic polynomial for G:\nP(G, k) = P(G - X, k) - P(G/X, k) = P(G, k) - k(k-1)^2\n\nSince we have P(G, k) on both sides again, we need to find a different way to calculate the chromatic polynomial for G. Let's use the chromatic polynomial properties and the fact that G is a complete graph on 4 vertices with an additional edge X.\n\n7. The chromatic polynomial for a complete graph K_n is given by:\nP(K_n, k) = k(k-1)...(k-n+1)\n\n8. For G, we have a complete graph on 4 vertices (K_4) with an additional edge X. The chromatic polynomial for K_4 is:\nP(K_4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\n9. Since G has an additional edge X, we can use the chromatic polynomial property that adding an edge between two non-adjacent vertices in a complete graph does not change the chromatic polynomial. Therefore, the chromatic polynomial for G is the same as for K_4:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)"
