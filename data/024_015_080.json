    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ of the given 2-form $\\omega$, we apply the exterior derivative to each of the terms in $\\omega$ and then take the wedge product with the corresponding differential forms. Recall that the exterior derivative is a linear operation and obeys the product rule.\n\nFirst, let's compute the exterior derivatives of the coefficients of the given 2-form:\n\n$d(x+y) = dx + dy$\n\n$d(2z-y) = -dy + 2dz$\n\nNow, we apply the product rule and linearity to compute $d\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = d[(x+y)dx \\wedge dy] + d[(2z-y)dz \\wedge dx]$\n\nUsing the product rule, we have:\n\n$d\\omega = (dx + dy) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + (-dy + 2dz) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$\n\nNow, we simplify the expression by noting that $dx \\wedge dx = dy \\wedge dy = dz \\wedge dz = 0$ and that the wedge product is antisymmetric:\n\n$d\\omega = dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dy - 2dz \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$\n\nSince $dy \\wedge dx = - dx \\wedge dy$ and $dz \\wedge dz = 0$, we can further simplify the expression:\n\n$d\\omega = - dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dy$\n\nFinally, we note that $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, so the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n\n$d\\omega = 0$\n\nThus, the exterior derivative of the given 2-form $\\omega$ is the zero 3-form."
