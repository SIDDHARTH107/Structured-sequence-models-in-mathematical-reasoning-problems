    "message_2": "X is not path-connected.\n\nRecall that a topological space X is path-connected if for every pair of points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nSince the connected components of X are {0, 1, 2} and {3, 4}, this means that these two sets are connected, and there is no continuous function that can connect a point from one set to a point in the other set. In other words, there is no continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) ∈ {0, 1, 2} and f(1) ∈ {3, 4}.\n\nFor example, let x = 1 and y = 3. There is no continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 3, because any such function would have to \"jump\" from the connected component {0, 1, 2} to the connected component {3, 4}, which is not possible for a continuous function.\n\nThus, X is not path-connected."
