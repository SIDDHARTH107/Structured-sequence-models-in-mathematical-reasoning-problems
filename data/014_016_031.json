If you are given a message \"Hello\" and shift the letters by 3 positions, the message becomes \"Khoor\". \n\nSuppose you receive a Caeser cipher encrypted message \"Jnufyx\", and you know that the shift used to encrypt the message is 6 (i.e., each letter is shifted 6 positions down the alphabet). What is the original message before encryption?",
