    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from selling one unit of product A is $15 and from selling one unit of product B is $20. The production process requires the use of two machines, X and Y. The time required to produce one unit of product A on machine X is 2 hours, on machine Y it is 3 hours; and to produce one unit of product B on machine X is 3 hours, on machine Y it is 2 hours. If the factory has 100 hours of machine X time and 90 hours of machine Y time available each week, what is the maximum profit that can be obtained from manufacturing both A and B products? (Assume that all the produced units can be sold.) \n\nThe student is tasked to use robust optimization techniques to find the optimal production quantity of each product that maximizes the profit, given the uncertainty in the manufacturing process parameters.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 15x + 20y, subject to the constraints on machine time.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 100 (Machine X time constraint)\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 90 (Machine Y time constraint)\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph.\n\n1. 2x + 3y = 100 -> y = (100 - 2x) / 3\n2. 3x + 2y = 90 -> y = (90 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 20), and (30, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 15(0) + 20(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 30) = 15(0) + 20(30) = $600\n3. P(20, 20) = 15(20) + 20(20) = $700\n4. P(30, 0) = 15(30) + 20(0) = $450\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at the vertex (20, 20), with a profit of $700. Therefore, the factory should produce 20 units of product A and 20 units of product B to maximize the profit under the given constraints."
