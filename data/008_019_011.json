    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in the second and third equations equal:\n\n1) 3x + 2y + 4z = 9 + 6i\n2) 2(x - 5y + 2z) = 2(-6 - 7i)\n3) 1(2x + 3y - 6z) = 1(8 + 2i)\n\nThis results in:\n\n1) 3x + 2y + 4z = 9 + 6i\n2) 2x - 10y + 4z = -12 - 14i\n3) 2x + 3y - 6z = 8 + 2i\n\nNow, let's subtract the third equation from the second equation:\n\n(2x - 10y + 4z) - (2x + 3y - 6z) = (-12 - 14i) - (8 + 2i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-13y + 10z = -20 - 16i\n\nNow, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract the third equation from it:\n\n2(3x + 2y + 4z) - (2x + 3y - 6z) = 2(9 + 6i) - (8 + 2i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4x + y + 14z = 10 + 10i\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n1) -13y + 10z = -20 - 16i\n2) 4x + y + 14z = 10 + 10i\n\nLet's solve for y in the second equation:\n\ny = -4x - 14z + 10 + 10i\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n-13(-4x - 14z + 10 + 10i) + 10z = -20 - 16i\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n52x + 182z - 130 - 130i + 10z = -20 - 16i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n52x + 192z = 110 + 114i\n\nNow we can solve for z in terms of x:\n\n192z = -52x + 110 + 114i\n\nz = (-13x + 55/2 + 57i/2) / 48\n\nNow substitute this expression for z back into the equation for y:\n\ny = -4x - 14((-13x + 55/2 + 57i/2) / 48) + 10 + 10i\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ny = -4x + (91x - 385/4 - 399i/4) / 12 + 10 + 10i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ny = (55x - 385/4 - 399i/4) / 12 + 10 + 10i\n\nNow we have expressions for y and z in terms of x:\n\ny = (55x - 385/4 - 399i/4) / 12 + 10 + 10i\nz = (-13x + 55/2 + 57i/2) / 48\n\nSubstitute these expressions for y and z back into the original first equation:\n\n3x + 2((55x - 385/4 - 399i/4) / 12 + 10 + 10i) + 4((-13x + 55/2 + 57i/2) / 48) = 9 + 6i\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n3x + (110x - 385/2 - 399i/2) / 6 + (-52x + 55 + 57i) / 12 = 9 + 6i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3x + 110x/6 - 52x/12) + (-385/2 - 399i/2)/6 + (55 + 57i)/12 = 9 + 6i\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(25x + 55/4 + 57i/4) = 9 + 6i\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n25x = 9 - 55/4 - 57i/4 + 6i\n\nx = (1/4 - 57i/4) / 25\n\nx = 1/100 - 57i/100\n\nNow we have the value of x, we can find the values of y and z by plugging the value of x back into the expressions for y and z:\n\ny = (55(1/100 - 57i/100) - 385/4 - 399i/4) / 12 + 10 + 10i\nz = (-13(1/100 - 57i/100) + 55/2 + 57i/2) / 48\n\nAfter plugging in the value of x and simplifying, we get:\n\ny = 49/20 - 33i/20\nz = 3/4 + 5i/4\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 1/100 - 57i/100\ny = 49/20 - 33i/20\nz = 3/4 + 5i/4"
