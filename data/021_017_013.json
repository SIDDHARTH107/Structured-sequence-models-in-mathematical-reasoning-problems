    "message_2": "To find the optimal value of x that maximizes the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 6 within the interval [-5, 5] using the differential evolution algorithm, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions randomly within the interval [-5, 5].\n2. For each candidate solution, calculate its fitness (i.e., the value of f(x)).\n3. Perform the mutation, crossover, and selection steps of the differential evolution algorithm.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the stopping criterion is met (i.e., the difference between the best and worst fitness values in the population is less than the tolerance of 0.001).\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the differential evolution algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 5*x - 6\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, tol, max_iter):\n    pop = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=pop_size)\n    best = max(pop, key=f)\n    best_fitness = f(best)\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            a, b, c = pop[np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)]\n            mutant = a + 0.5 * (b - c)\n            if f(mutant) > f(pop[i]):\n                pop[i] = mutant\n\n        new_best = max(pop, key=f)\n        new_best_fitness = f(new_best)\n        if new_best_fitness > best_fitness:\n            best, best_fitness = new_best, new_best_fitness\n\n        if np.ptp([f(x) for x in pop]) < tol:\n            break\n\n    return best\n\noptimal_x = differential_evolution(pop_size=50, bounds=(-5, 5), tol=0.001, max_iter=1000)\nprint(\"Optimal value of x:\", optimal_x)\n```\n\nThis code will output the optimal value of x that maximizes the function f(x) within the given interval and tolerance. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm."
