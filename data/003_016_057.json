    "message_2": "The phase shift of a trigonometric function is the horizontal shift of the function along the x-axis. In the given equation, y = 3 sin(2x - π/4), the phase shift can be determined by looking at the term inside the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sine function is y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, the equation is y = 3 sin(2(x - π/8)). Comparing this to the general form, we can see that the phase shift C is π/8.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function is π/8."
