    "message_2": "To find the value of 𝑓(3), we need to compute the inverse Fourier transform of 𝐹(𝑠). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\n𝑓(𝑡) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[𝐹(𝑠) * e^(𝑗𝑠𝑡)] d𝑠\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the entire frequency domain (from -∞ to +∞).\n\nGiven 𝐹(𝑠) = (4𝑠)/(1+4𝑠^2), we have:\n\n𝑓(𝑡) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[((4𝑠)/(1+4𝑠^2)) * e^(𝑗𝑠𝑡)] d𝑠\n\nThis integral is not easy to compute directly. However, we can use the property of Fourier transforms that states:\n\nIf 𝐹(𝑠) is the Fourier transform of 𝑓(𝑡), then the Fourier transform of 𝑓'(𝑡) (the derivative of 𝑓(𝑡) with respect to 𝑡) is 𝑗𝑠𝐹(𝑠).\n\nLet's find the Fourier transform of 𝑓'(𝑡):\n\n𝑓'(𝑡) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[(𝑗𝑠(4𝑠)/(1+4𝑠^2)) * e^(𝑗𝑠𝑡)] d𝑠\n\nNow, we can recognize that the integral is the convolution of two functions:\n\n(4𝑠)/(1+4𝑠^2) and e^(𝑗𝑠𝑡)\n\nThe convolution theorem states that the inverse Fourier transform of the product of two functions is the convolution of their inverse Fourier transforms. Therefore, we have:\n\n𝑓'(𝑡) = (1/π) * ∫[e^(-2|τ|) * δ(t-τ)] dτ\n\nwhere δ(t) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can compute the integral:\n\n𝑓'(𝑡) = (1/π) * e^(-2|t|)\n\nTo find 𝑓(𝑡), we need to integrate 𝑓'(𝑡) with respect to 𝑡:\n\n𝑓(𝑡) = (1/π) * ∫[e^(-2|τ|)] dτ + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nWe are given that 𝑓(0) = 1, so we can find the value of C:\n\n1 = (1/π) * ∫[e^(-2|0|)] dτ + C\n\n1 = C\n\nThus, 𝑓(𝑡) = (1/π) * ∫[e^(-2|τ|)] dτ + 1\n\nNow, we can find the value of 𝑓(3):\n\n𝑓(3) = (1/π) * ∫[e^(-2|τ|)] dτ + 1\n\nSince the integral is an odd function, its value is 0 when evaluated at 𝑡 = 3:\n\n𝑓(3) = 0 + 1 = 1"
