    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72 among the given options, we need to determine if any of these groups are isomorphic to each other. If they are not, then we can simply count the number of distinct groups.\n\n1. Cyclic group C72: This group has order 72 and is abelian. No other group in the list is abelian, so C72 is not isomorphic to any other group in the list.\n\n2. Alternating group A4 × C3 × C2: This group has order 4! × 3 × 2 = 72. A4 is non-abelian, so the direct product A4 × C3 × C2 is also non-abelian. Since it is non-abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to C72. We need to check if it is isomorphic to any of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\n3. 51 non-abelian groups of order 72: These groups are non-abelian and have order 72. We are not given any information about their structure, so we cannot determine if any of them are isomorphic to each other or to A4 × C3 × C2.\n\nTherefore, we have at least 2 non-isomorphic groups (C72 and A4 × C3 × C2) and potentially up to 51 more non-abelian groups. Without more information about the structure of the 51 non-abelian groups, we cannot determine the exact number of non-isomorphic groups. However, we can say that there are at least 2 and at most 53 non-isomorphic groups of order 72 among the given options."
