    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car after 5 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nSince the car starts from rest, the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s. The acceleration (a) is given as 4 m/s², and the time (t) is 5 seconds.\n\nv = 0 + (4 m/s²)(5 s)\n\nv = (4 m/s²)(5 s)\n\nv = 20 m/s\n\nThe car's velocity after 5 seconds is 20 m/s."
