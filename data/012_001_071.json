    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 5 using Dijkstra's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited vertices and initialize the distance to the starting vertex (vertex 1) to 0 and the distance to all other vertices to infinity.\n2. Select the vertex with the smallest distance value that has not been visited yet.\n3. Update the distances of the neighboring vertices of the selected vertex.\n4. Mark the selected vertex as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all vertices have been visited or the target vertex (vertex 5) has been visited.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. Initialize the unvisited set and distances:\n   Unvisited: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞}\n\n2. Vertex 1 has the smallest distance (0) and has not been visited yet. Select vertex 1.\n\n3. Update the distances of the neighboring vertices of vertex 1:\n   - Vertex 2: min(∞, 0 + 4) = 4\n   - Vertex 3: ∞ (not a neighbor)\n   - Vertex 4: ∞ (not a neighbor)\n   - Vertex 5: ∞ (not a neighbor)\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 4, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞}\n\n4. Mark vertex 1 as visited: {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4:\n\n   - Select vertex 2 (smallest distance: 4)\n   - Update distances:\n     - Vertex 3: min(∞, 4 + 3) = 7\n     - Vertex 4: min(∞, 4 + 1) = 5\n     - Vertex 5: ∞ (not a neighbor)\n   - Mark vertex 2 as visited: {3, 4, 5}\n\n   - Select vertex 4 (smallest distance: 5)\n   - Update distances:\n     - Vertex 3: min(7, 5 + 5) = 7 (no change)\n     - Vertex 5: min(∞, 5 + 2) = 7\n   - Mark vertex 4 as visited: {3, 5}\n\n   - Select vertex 3 (smallest distance: 7)\n   - Update distances:\n     - Vertex 5: min(7, 7 + 0) = 7 (no change)\n   - Mark vertex 3 as visited: {5}\n\nSince vertex 5 has been visited, we can stop the algorithm. The shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 5 has a distance of 7. To find the path itself, we can backtrack from vertex 5:\n\n- Vertex 5: distance 7, reached from vertex 4\n- Vertex 4: distance 5, reached from vertex 2\n- Vertex 2: distance 4, reached from vertex 1\n\nSo, the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 5 is: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5."
