    "message_2": "(a) To find the maximum value of |f(z)| on the unit circle |z|=1, we can use the fact that |z|=1 and rewrite the function f(z) in terms of z and its conjugate z*.\n\nLet z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers. Then z* = x - iy and |z|^2 = zz* = x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nNow, f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 2 = (x + iy)^2 + 2(x + iy) + 2.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nf(z) = (x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2) + i(2xy + 2y).\n\nNow, |f(z)|^2 = (x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2)^2 + (2xy + 2y)^2.\n\nWe want to maximize |f(z)|^2, so let's find its partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∂(|f(z)|^2)/∂x = 4(x^3 + 3x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2)\n∂(|f(z)|^2)/∂y = 4(2xy^2 + 2y^3 + 2y).\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:\n\n4(x^3 + 3x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2) = 0\n4(2xy^2 + 2y^3 + 2y) = 0.\n\nFrom the second equation, we get y(x^2 + y^2 + 1) = 0. Since |z|=1, we have x^2 + y^2 = 1, so y cannot be zero. Therefore, x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 0, which is impossible since x^2 + y^2 = 1.\n\nThus, there are no critical points inside the unit circle. Therefore, the maximum value of |f(z)| must occur on the boundary, i.e., on the unit circle |z|=1.\n\nLet z = e^(iθ) be a point on the unit circle. Then:\n\nf(z) = e^(2iθ) + 2e^(iθ) + 2.\n\nNow, |f(z)|^2 = |e^(2iθ) + 2e^(iθ) + 2|^2.\n\nLet w = e^(iθ). Then |f(z)|^2 = |w^2 + 2w + 2|^2.\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n|f(z)|^2 = |(w + 1)^2 + 1|^2.\n\nNow, |f(z)|^2 is maximized when |w + 1|^2 is minimized. Since w is on the unit circle, the minimum value of |w + 1|^2 is achieved when w = -1, which gives |w + 1|^2 = 0.\n\nThus, the maximum value of |f(z)| is:\n\n|max(|f(z)|)| = sqrt(|(w + 1)^2 + 1|^2) = sqrt(1) = 1.\n\n(b) To find the minimum value of |f(z)| on the unit circle |z|=1, we can use the result from part (a). Since |f(z)|^2 = |(w + 1)^2 + 1|^2, the minimum value of |f(z)|^2 is achieved when |w + 1|^2 is maximized.\n\nSince w is on the unit circle, the maximum value of |w + 1|^2 is achieved when w = -1, which gives |w + 1|^2 = 4.\n\nThus, the minimum value of |f(z)| is:\n\n|min(|f(z)|)| = sqrt(|(w + 1)^2 + 1|^2) = sqrt(5)."
