    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The profit for each unit of Product A is $20, and the profit for each unit of Product B is $30. The factory has a daily production capacity of 100 units. The factory also has a limited number of raw materials available: 150 units of Material 1 and 200 units of Material 2. The production of each unit of Product A requires 1 unit of Material 1 and 2 units of Material 2, while each unit of Product B requires 2 units of Material 1 and 1 unit of Material 2. The factory wants to maximize its daily profit. How many units of Product A and Product B should it produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the daily profit is:\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints based on the production capacity and raw materials are:\n1. x + y ≤ 100 (production capacity)\n2. x + 2y ≤ 200 (Material 2 constraint)\n3. 2x + y ≤ 150 (Material 1 constraint)\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 100\ny ≤ -x + 100\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 200\ny ≤ -0.5x + 100\n\n3. 2x + y ≤ 150\ny ≤ -2x + 150\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these three inequalities. Now we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the equations:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\nx + y = 100\nx + 2y = 200\nSolving these equations, we get x = 100 and y = 0.\n\nIntersection of (1) and (3):\nx + y = 100\n2x + y = 150\nSolving these equations, we get x = 50 and y = 50.\n\nIntersection of (2) and (3):\nx + 2y = 200\n2x + y = 150\nSolving these equations, we get x = 0 and y = 100.\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function at these vertices:\n\n1. (100, 0)\nProfit = 20(100) + 30(0) = 2000\n\n2. (50, 50)\nProfit = 20(50) + 30(50) = 1000 + 1500 = 2500\n\n3. (0, 100)\nProfit = 20(0) + 30(100) = 3000\n\nThe maximum daily profit is $3000, which occurs when the factory produces 0 units of Product A and 100 units of Product B."
