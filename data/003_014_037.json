    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot create visual graphs directly. However, I can provide you with the key features of the graph and the points you can use to sketch it yourself.\n\nFunction: y = 2cos(3x) - 1\n\nThe function is a cosine function with an amplitude of 2, a period of 2π/3, and a vertical shift of -1.\n\nKey features of the graph:\n\n1. Amplitude: 2\n2. Period: 2π/3\n3. Vertical shift: -1\n4. Phase shift: 0\n\nPoints to plot:\n\n1. (0, 2cos(0) - 1) = (0, 1)\n2. (π/6, 2cos(π/2) - 1) = (π/6, -1)\n3. (π/3, 2cos(π) - 1) = (π/3, -3)\n4. (π/2, 2cos(3π/2) - 1) = (π/2, -1)\n5. (2π/3, 2cos(2π) - 1) = (2π/3, 1)\n\nTo sketch the graph, plot these points on the coordinate plane and draw a smooth curve through them. The curve should resemble a cosine wave with the mentioned amplitude, period, and vertical shift. The graph will complete one full cycle between 0 and 2π/3, and you can extend the graph to 2π by repeating the pattern."
