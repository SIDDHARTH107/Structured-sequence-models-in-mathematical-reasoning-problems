    "message_1": "A standard deck of cards contains 52 cards. What is the probability of drawing a king of hearts from a shuffled deck of cards?",
    "message_2": "There is only 1 King of Hearts in a standard deck of 52 cards. To find the probability of drawing the King of Hearts, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (drawing the King of Hearts), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (total number of cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = 1/52\n\nSo, the probability of drawing the King of Hearts from a shuffled deck of cards is 1/52 or approximately 0.0192 or 1.92%."
