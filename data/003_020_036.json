    "message_2": "To determine the height the ladder reaches up the wall, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for right-angled triangles. The theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder, in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the base and the height).\n\nLet's denote the length of the ladder as c, the base as a, and the height as b. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe are given that the ladder (c) is 12 meters long, and the base (a) is 9 meters away from the wall. We need to find the height (b).\n\n12^2 = 9^2 + b^2\n144 = 81 + b^2\n\nNow, subtract 81 from both sides of the equation:\n\n144 - 81 = b^2\n63 = b^2\n\nTo find the height (b), take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √63\nb ≈ 7.94 meters\n\nSo, the height the ladder reaches up the wall is approximately 7.94 meters."
