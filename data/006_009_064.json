    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a person having a certain medical condition is 5%. If a classroom has 30 students, what is the probability that at least one student in the class has the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability of the opposite event occurring. In this case, the opposite event is that none of the students have the medical condition.\n\nThe probability of a student not having the medical condition is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nThe probability of all 30 students not having the medical condition is 0.95^30 ≈ 0.214.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one student having the medical condition by subtracting the complementary probability from 1:\n\n1 - 0.214 ≈ 0.786.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one student in the class has the medical condition is approximately 78.6%."
