    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial for G, we can use the deletion-contraction formula. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G. The deletion-contraction formula states that P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G*e, k), where G-e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G*e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nLet's choose the edge connecting vertices 1 and 2 (denoted as e = {1, 2}). \n\nFirst, we compute P(G-e, k):\n\n```\n     1   2\n    / \\   |\n   3 - 4 - 5\n```\n\nThis graph is a tree, and the chromatic polynomial of a tree is k(k-1)^(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 5, so P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\nNext, we compute P(G*e, k):\n\n```\n     1,2\n    /   |\n   3 - 4 - 5\n```\n\nIn this graph, we have a cycle of length 3 (triangle) with an additional vertex connected to one of the vertices in the cycle. To find the chromatic polynomial, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. There are k ways to color vertex 1,2.\n2. There are (k-1) ways to color vertex 4, since it cannot have the same color as vertex 1,2.\n3. There are (k-2) ways to color vertex 3, since it cannot have the same color as vertex 1,2 or vertex 4.\n4. There are (k-1) ways to color vertex 5, since it cannot have the same color as vertex 1,2.\n\nSo, P(G*e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1).\n\nNow, we can apply the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G*e, k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1).\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial for the given graph G."
