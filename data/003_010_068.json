    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the flagpole) to the adjacent side (length of the shadow).\n\nLet h be the height of the flagpole. We are given the angle of elevation (60 degrees) and the length of the shadow (15 meters). We can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 15\n\nWe know that tan(60°) = √3. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n√3 = h / 15\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 15 * √3\n\nh ≈ 15 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 25.98\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the flagpole is approximately 26 meters."
