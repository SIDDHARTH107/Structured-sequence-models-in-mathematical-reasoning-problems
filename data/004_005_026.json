    "message_2": "To find the solution to the given differential equation dy/dx = 2x + 3 with the initial condition y(0) = 5, we need to integrate both sides of the equation with respect to x.\n\n∫(dy/dx) dx = ∫(2x + 3) dx\n\nIntegrating the right side of the equation:\n\ny(x) = ∫(2x + 3) dx = x^2 + 3x + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition y(0) = 5:\n\n5 = 0^2 + 3(0) + C\n\n5 = C\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5"
