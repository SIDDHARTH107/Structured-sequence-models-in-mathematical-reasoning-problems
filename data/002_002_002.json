    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 cm, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) × 3.14159 × 5³\n\nV = (4/3) × 3.14159 × 125\n\nV = 1.33333 × 3.14159 × 125\n\nV = 523.598 cubic centimeters\n\nRounded to one decimal place, the volume of the sphere is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
