    "message_2": "Let π₁(X, x₀) denote the fundamental group of X based at x₀, and π₁(E, e) denote the fundamental group of E based at e. Since X has a fundamental group isomorphic to Z, we have π₁(X, x₀) ≅ Z.\n\nNow, let's consider the covering map p: E -> X. The lifting criterion for covering spaces states that a loop in X based at x₀ can be lifted to a unique loop in E based at e if and only if the induced homomorphism p_*: π₁(E, e) -> π₁(X, x₀) maps the loop's homotopy class to the homotopy class of the original loop in X.\n\nSince p is a covering map, p_* is injective. This means that the image of π₁(E, e) under p_* is a subgroup of π₁(X, x₀). Let's denote this subgroup as H = p_*(π₁(E, e)). Since π₁(X, x₀) ≅ Z, H must be isomorphic to nZ for some integer n, where nZ denotes the set of all integer multiples of n.\n\nNow, we want to determine the fundamental group π₁(E, e). Since p_* is injective, we know that π₁(E, e) is isomorphic to its image H in π₁(X, x₀). Therefore, π₁(E, e) ≅ nZ for some integer n.\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental group of E based at e is isomorphic to nZ for some integer n."
