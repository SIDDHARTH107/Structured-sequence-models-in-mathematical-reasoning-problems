    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 cm and a leg of 6 cm. Find the length of the other leg.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the other leg as \"a\" and use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for it. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the hypotenuse is 10 cm, and one leg (b) is 6 cm.\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe can plug in the values we know: a^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\n\nSimplify the equation: a^2 + 36 = 100\n\nNow, subtract 36 from both sides of the equation: a^2 = 64\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides to solve for a: a = âˆš64\n\na = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
