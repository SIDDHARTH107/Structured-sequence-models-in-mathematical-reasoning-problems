Here is an example problem:\n\nA spring-mass system is modeled by the differential equation:\n$m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c\\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0$\nwhere m, c, and k are positive constants representing the mass, damping coefficient, and spring constant, respectively. The system is initially at rest, and the mass is displaced slightly from its equilibrium position, resulting in a small amplitude vibration. If the system has a mass of 0.2kg, damping coefficient of 0.03kg/s, and spring constant of 12N/m, and the initial displacement is 0.05m, determine the position function $x(t)$ for  $t\\geq0$.\n\n(Note: The solution to this problem requires solving a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation, which can be done using standard methods such as finding the characteristic equation and using the roots to construct the general solution.)",
    "message_2": "Given the spring-mass system's differential equation:\n\n$m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c\\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0$\n\nwith m = 0.2 kg, c = 0.03 kg/s, and k = 12 N/m. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$0.2\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 0.03\\frac{dx}{dt} + 12x = 0$\n\nTo solve this second-order linear homogeneous differential equation, we first find the characteristic equation:\n\n$0.2r^2 + 0.03r + 12 = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\n$r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nwhere a = 0.2, b = 0.03, and c = 12. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{-0.03 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.03)^2 - 4(0.2)(12)}}{2(0.2)}$\n\n$r = \\frac{-0.03 \\pm \\sqrt{0.0009 - 9.6}}{0.4}$\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, we have complex roots. Let's rewrite the discriminant as follows:\n\n$0.0009 - 9.6 = -9.5991 = (3.1i)^2$\n\nNow we can find the roots:\n\n$r = \\frac{-0.03 \\pm 3.1i}{0.4}$\n\n$r_1 = -0.075 + 7.75i$\n\n$r_2 = -0.075 - 7.75i$\n\nNow we can write the general solution as:\n\n$x(t) = e^{-0.075t}(A\\cos(7.75t) + B\\sin(7.75t))$\n\nWe are given the initial conditions: x(0) = 0.05m (initial displacement) and $\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 0$ (initially at rest).\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\n$x(0) = 0.05 = e^{-0.075(0)}(A\\cos(7.75(0)) + B\\sin(7.75(0)))$\n\n$0.05 = A$\n\nNow, we need to find B. First, let's find the derivative of x(t):\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = -0.075e^{-0.075t}(A\\cos(7.75t) + B\\sin(7.75t)) + e^{-0.075t}(-7.75A\\sin(7.75t) + 7.75B\\cos(7.75t))$\n\nNow, apply the initial condition $\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 0$:\n\n$0 = -0.075(A) + 7.75B$\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\n$B = \\frac{0.075A}{7.75} = \\frac{0.075(0.05)}{7.75} = 0.000481$\n\nNow we have the position function x(t) for $t \\geq 0$:\n\n$x(t) = e^{-0.075t}(0.05\\cos(7.75t) + 0.000481\\sin(7.75t))$"
