    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10, and let x be an element of order 5 in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Since x has order 5, the subgroup generated by x, denoted as ⟨x⟩, has order 5. Now, let's consider the quotient group G/⟨x⟩. This group has order 2, as |G|/|⟨x⟩| = 10/5 = 2.\n\nSince G/⟨x⟩ has order 2, there exists an element y in G such that y^2 is in ⟨x⟩. If y^2 = e (the identity element), then y has order 2. If y^2 = x^k for some k, then y^2 = x^(5k) since x has order 5. Since y^2 is in ⟨x⟩, we have y^2 = x^k for some 0 ≤ k < 5. We claim that k must be 0, which means y^2 = e.\n\nSuppose k is not 0. Then, gcd(k, 5) = 1, since k < 5. By the properties of cyclic groups, ⟨x^k⟩ = ⟨x⟩. Now, consider the element xy. We have (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = x^2(x^k) = x^(2+k). Since 2 + k is not divisible by 5, and gcd(2+k, 5) = 1, we have ⟨x^(2+k)⟩ = ⟨x⟩. This means that xy is in ⟨x⟩, which is a contradiction, as y is not in ⟨x⟩. Therefore, k must be 0, and y^2 = e.\n\nNow, we have x^5 = e and y^2 = e. We also have xy ≠ yx, as otherwise G would be abelian and isomorphic to C10. Thus, G is generated by x and y, with the relations x^5 = e, y^2 = e, and yx = x^(-1)y. This is precisely the presentation of the dihedral group D5. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D5."
