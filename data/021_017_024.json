    "message_2": "To apply the differential evolution algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population with random solutions within the given interval.\n2. For each iteration, perform mutation, crossover, and selection.\n3. After the specified number of iterations, find the best solution in the population.\n\nLet's implement the algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 5*x + 6\n\ndef initialize_population(pop_size, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    return np.random.uniform(lower_bound, upper_bound, size=(pop_size, 1))\n\ndef mutation(population, F):\n    mutated_population = np.zeros(population.shape)\n    for i in range(population.shape[0]):\n        idxs = [idx for idx in range(population.shape[0]) if idx != i]\n        a, b, c = population[np.random.choice(idxs, 3, replace=False)]\n        mutated_population[i] = a + F * (b - c)\n    return mutated_population\n\ndef crossover(population, mutated_population, CR):\n    crossover_population = np.zeros(population.shape)\n    for i in range(population.shape[0]):\n        j_rand = np.random.randint(0, population.shape[1])\n        for j in range(population.shape[1]):\n            if np.random.rand() < CR or j == j_rand:\n                crossover_population[i, j] = mutated_population[i, j]\n            else:\n                crossover_population[i, j] = population[i, j]\n    return crossover_population\n\ndef selection(population, crossover_population):\n    new_population = np.zeros(population.shape)\n    for i in range(population.shape[0]):\n        if f(crossover_population[i]) < f(population[i]):\n            new_population[i] = crossover_population[i]\n        else:\n            new_population[i] = population[i]\n    return new_population\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, iterations, lower_bound, upper_bound, F, CR):\n    population = initialize_population(pop_size, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        mutated_population = mutation(population, F)\n        crossover_population = crossover(population, mutated_population, CR)\n        population = selection(population, crossover_population)\n    best_solution = population[np.argmin([f(x) for x in population])]\n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\npop_size = 20\niterations = 100\nlower_bound = -10\nupper_bound = 10\nF = 0.8\nCR = 0.9\n\nbest_solution, min_value = differential_evolution(pop_size, iterations, lower_bound, upper_bound, F, CR)\nprint(\"Best solution:\", best_solution)\nprint(\"Minimum value:\", min_value)\n```\n\nThe above code implements the differential evolution algorithm for the given function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6 with a population size of 20 and 100 iterations. The mutation factor F is set to 0.8, and the crossover rate CR is set to 0.9. The best solution and minimum value will be printed at the end.\n\nPlease note that the differential evolution algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the results may vary slightly between different runs."
