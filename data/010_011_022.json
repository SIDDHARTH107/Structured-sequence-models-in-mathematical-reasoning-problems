    "message_2": "To cover a 3-dimensional manifold that is topologically equivalent to a sphere $S^3$, we can use stereographic projection. Stereographic projection is a smooth map that projects a sphere onto a plane, with one point of the sphere removed. \n\nIn the case of $S^3$, we can use two stereographic projections, one from the \"north pole\" and one from the \"south pole\". Each projection will cover the entire sphere except for the point it is projecting from. By using both projections, we can cover the entire sphere.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of smooth coordinate charts required to cover a 3-dimensional manifold that is topologically equivalent to a sphere $S^3$ is 2."
