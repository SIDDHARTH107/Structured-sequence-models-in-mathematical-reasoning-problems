    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the Morse function f(x, y), we need to find the points where the gradient of f is zero. The gradient of f is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x - 4x^3 + 4xy^2\n∂f/∂y = -2y + 4x^2y - 4y^3\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n2x - 4x^3 + 4xy^2 = 0\n-2y + 4x^2y - 4y^3 = 0\n\nLet's solve this system of equations for x and y. We can factor out common terms in both equations:\n\nx(2 - 4x^2 + 4y^2) = 0\ny(-2 + 4x^2 - 4y^2) = 0\n\nNow, we have four cases to consider:\n\n1. x = 0 and y = 0\nIn this case, both equations are satisfied, so (0, 0) is a critical point.\n\n2. x = 0 and -2 + 4x^2 - 4y^2 = 0\nIn this case, the second equation becomes -2 = 0, which has no solution for y.\n\n3. y = 0 and 2 - 4x^2 + 4y^2 = 0\nIn this case, the first equation becomes 2 - 4x^2 = 0, which has solutions x = ±√(1/2). So, we have two critical points (±√(1/2), 0).\n\n4. 2 - 4x^2 + 4y^2 = 0 and -2 + 4x^2 - 4y^2 = 0\nAdding both equations, we get 0 = 0, which is always true. However, this case does not provide any additional critical points, as it is already covered by the previous cases.\n\nNow, we need to find the index of each critical point. The index is given by the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of f. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\nH(f) = | ∂^2f/∂x^2  ∂^2f/∂x∂y |\n          | ∂^2f/∂y∂x  ∂^2f/∂y^2 |\n\nLet's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂^2f/∂x^2 = 2 - 12x^2 + 4y^2\n∂^2f/∂x∂y = 8xy\n∂^2f/∂y∂x = 8xy\n∂^2f/∂y^2 = -2 + 4x^2 - 12y^2\n\nNow, let's compute the Hessian matrix for each critical point:\n\nH(f)(0, 0) = |  2   0 |\n                   |  0  -2 |\n\nH(f)(±√(1/2), 0) = | -1  0 |\n                             |  0  1 |\n\nThe eigenvalues of H(f)(0, 0) are 2 and -2, so it has one negative eigenvalue, and its index is 1.\n\nThe eigenvalues of H(f)(±√(1/2), 0) are -1 and 1, so they both have one negative eigenvalue, and their indices are 1.\n\nNow, we have the critical points and their indices:\n\n(0, 0) with index 1\n(√(1/2), 0) with index 1\n(-√(1/2), 0) with index 1\n\nSince we have three critical points with index 1, there are three index pairs and three cells in the Morse-Smale complex.\n\nSo, the number of critical points is 3, the number of index pairs is 3, and the number of cells in the complex is 3."
