    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the control system to a sinusoidal input, we need to find the magnitude and phase of the transfer function G(s) at the given frequency. The sinusoidal input can be represented as:\n\nx(t) = 2.5 * sin(2π * 4t)\n\nThe Laplace transform of the sinusoidal input is:\n\nX(s) = 2.5 * L{sin(2π * 4t)} = 2.5 * (2π * 4) / (s^2 + (2π * 4)^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the output Y(s) in the frequency domain:\n\nY(s) = G(s) * X(s)\n\nY(s) = [(3s + 7) / (s^2 + 2s + 5)] * [(2.5 * 2π * 4) / (s^2 + (2π * 4)^2)]\n\nTo find the steady-state response, we need to evaluate G(s) at s = jω, where ω = 2π * 4 rad/s:\n\nG(jω) = (3(jω) + 7) / ((jω)^2 + 2(jω) + 5)\n\nG(jω) = (3(8πj) + 7) / ((8πj)^2 + 2(8πj) + 5)\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude and phase of G(jω):\n\n|G(jω)| = sqrt((Re(G(jω)))^2 + (Im(G(jω)))^2)\n\n∠G(jω) = atan2(Im(G(jω)), Re(G(jω)))\n\nAfter calculating the magnitude and phase of G(jω), we can find the steady-state response y(t) in the time domain:\n\ny(t) = |G(jω)| * 2.5 * sin(2π * 4t + ∠G(jω))\n\nCalculating the magnitude and phase of G(jω):\n\n|G(jω)| ≈ 0.41\n∠G(jω) ≈ -1.29 rad\n\nFinally, the steady-state response y(t) is:\n\ny(t) ≈ 0.41 * 2.5 * sin(2π * 4t - 1.29)\n\ny(t) ≈ 1.03 * sin(2π * 4t - 1.29)"
