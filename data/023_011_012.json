    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform F(ω) of the given function f(t), we can use the following definition of the Fourier Transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nHowever, since f(t) is a sum of sinusoidal functions, we can use the linearity property of the Fourier Transform and find the Fourier Transform of each term separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's find the Fourier Transform of each term:\n\n1) For the first term, 3cos(2πt):\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite the cosine function as:\n\ncos(2πt) = (1/2)(e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt))\n\nNow, the Fourier Transform of 3cos(2πt) is:\n\n(3/2) * [∫(e^(j2πt) * e^(-jωt) dt) + ∫(e^(-j2πt) * e^(-jωt) dt)]\n\nThe first term in the brackets is the Fourier Transform of e^(j2πt), and the second term is the Fourier Transform of e^(-j2πt). We can use the property of the Fourier Transform of an exponential function:\n\n∫(e^(j(α-ω)t) dt) = 2π * δ(ω - α), where δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nSo, the Fourier Transform of 3cos(2πt) is:\n\n(3/2) * [2π * δ(ω - 2π) + 2π * δ(ω + 2π)] = 3π[δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\n\n2) For the second term, 2sin(4πt):\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite the sine function as:\n\nsin(4πt) = (1/2j)(e^(j4πt) - e^(-j4πt))\n\nNow, the Fourier Transform of 2sin(4πt) is:\n\n(1/j) * [∫(e^(j4πt) * e^(-jωt) dt) - ∫(e^(-j4πt) * e^(-jωt) dt)]\n\nUsing the same property of the Fourier Transform of an exponential function as before, we get:\n\n(1/j) * [2π * δ(ω - 4π) - 2π * δ(ω + 4π)] = (2π/j)[δ(ω - 4π) - δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier Transforms of both terms to get the Fourier Transform of the whole function f(t):\n\nF(ω) = 3π[δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)] + (2π/j)[δ(ω - 4π) - δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nThe frequency components present in the signal f(t) can be found by looking at the Dirac delta functions in F(ω):\n\n1) ω = ±2π: This corresponds to the first term, 3cos(2πt), with an amplitude of 3.\n2) ω = ±4π: This corresponds to the second term, 2sin(4πt), with an amplitude of 2.\n\nSo, the frequency components present in the given signal f(t) are:\n\n1) A frequency of 2π with an amplitude of 3.\n2) A frequency of 4π with an amplitude of 2."
