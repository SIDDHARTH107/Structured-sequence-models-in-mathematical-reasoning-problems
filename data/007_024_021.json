However, it is important to note that the powers of 2 will start repeating after a certain point due to the cyclic nature of modular arithmetic. In this case, the powers of 2 start repeating after x = 18 (2^18 ≡ 2^0 (mod 19)). Therefore, there is no solution for x in the equation 2^x ≡ 9 (mod 19)."
