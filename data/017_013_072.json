    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. We know that 18 = 2 * 3^2. By the Sylow Theorems, we can find the number of 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups in G.\n\nLet n_2 be the number of 2-Sylow subgroups and n_3 be the number of 3-Sylow subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 9 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9.\n2. n_3 divides 2 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can only be 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases for n_2 and n_3.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup and one 3-Sylow subgroup. Let P_2 be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup and P_3 be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since both P_2 and P_3 are unique, they are both normal in G. We have |P_2| = 2 and |P_3| = 9. Since P_2 and P_3 are normal, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is a cyclic group of order 18, i.e., G is isomorphic to C18.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are 9 2-Sylow subgroups and only one 3-Sylow subgroup. Let P_3 be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. We have |P_3| = 9. Now, let H be a subgroup of G such that |H| = 6. By the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem, there exists a subgroup K of G such that G is the semi-direct product of P_3 and K, i.e., G = P_3 ⋊ K. Since |P_3| = 9 and |K| = 6, G is a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 9\nThis case is not possible since n_3 can only be 1.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18, a non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
