    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^2 - 4), we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero, since these are the points where the function is not defined.\n\nThe denominator is z^2 - 4, so we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^2 - 4 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored as (z - 2)(z + 2) = 0. Thus, the solutions are z = 2 and z = -2. These are the points where the function is not defined, so they are the singularities of the function.\n\nNow we need to classify these singularities as removable, poles, or essential singularities.\n\n1. Removable singularities: A singularity is removable if the function can be redefined at the singular point such that the function becomes analytic at that point. In other words, if the numerator also has a zero at the singular point, then the singularity is removable.\n\nIn this case, the numerator is z^2 + 1, which does not have zeros at z = 2 or z = -2. Therefore, the singularities are not removable.\n\n2. Poles: A singularity is a pole if the function can be written as a quotient of two analytic functions, where the denominator has a zero of finite order at the singular point, and the numerator does not have a zero at that point.\n\nIn this case, the function is already given as a quotient of two analytic functions, and the denominator has zeros of order 1 at z = 2 and z = -2. The numerator does not have zeros at these points, so the singularities are poles.\n\n3. Essential singularities: A singularity is essential if it is not removable and not a pole.\n\nSince we have already determined that the singularities are poles, they cannot be essential singularities.\n\nIn conclusion, the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^2 - 4) are z = 2 and z = -2, and they are both poles."
