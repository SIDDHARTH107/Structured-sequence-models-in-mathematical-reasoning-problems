    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of partitioning. A partition of a set is a way of dividing the set into non-empty, non-overlapping subsets. The number of ways to partition a set of n elements is given by the Bell number B(n).\n\nFor a set of 4 objects, we can find the Bell number B(4) using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = Î£ (C(n-1, k) * B(k)), where the sum is taken over k = 0 to n-1, and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nUsing this relation, we can find B(4):\n\nB(4) = C(3, 0) * B(0) + C(3, 1) * B(1) + C(3, 2) * B(2) + C(3, 3) * B(3)\n\nB(0) = 1 (by definition)\nB(1) = 1 (there is only one way to partition a set with one element)\nB(2) = 2 (two ways to partition a set with two elements: {{1}, {2}} and {{1, 2}})\nB(3) = 5 (five ways to partition a set with three elements: {{1}, {2}, {3}}, {{1, 2}, {3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}, {{1}, {2, 3}}, and {{1, 2, 3}})\n\nNow we can calculate B(4):\n\nB(4) = C(3, 0) * 1 + C(3, 1) * 1 + C(3, 2) * 2 + C(3, 3) * 5\nB(4) = 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 1 * 5\nB(4) = 1 + 3 + 6 + 5\nB(4) = 15\n\nSo there are 15 ways to divide a set of 4 objects into non-empty subsets."
