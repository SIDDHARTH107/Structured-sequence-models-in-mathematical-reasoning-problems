    "message_1": "Suppose the heights of students in a class are normally distributed with a mean of 65 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. What percentage of the class has a height between 62 inches and 68 inches?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of students with a height between 62 inches and 68 inches, we will use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the data point, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we will find the z-scores for 62 inches and 68 inches.\n\nFor 62 inches:\nz1 = (62 - 65) / 3\nz1 = -3 / 3\nz1 = -1\n\nFor 68 inches:\nz2 = (68 - 65) / 3\nz2 = 3 / 3\nz2 = 1\n\nNow, we will look up the z-scores in the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding probabilities.\n\nFor z1 = -1, the probability is 0.1587 (15.87%).\nFor z2 = 1, the probability is 0.8413 (84.13%).\n\nTo find the percentage of students with a height between 62 inches and 68 inches, we will subtract the probability of z1 from the probability of z2.\n\nPercentage = P(z2) - P(z1)\nPercentage = 0.8413 - 0.1587\nPercentage = 0.6826\n\nSo, approximately 68.26% of the class has a height between 62 inches and 68 inches."
