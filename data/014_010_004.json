    "message_1": "A substitution cipher is created by replacing each letter of the alphabet with another letter. In a particular cipher, the letter 'A' is replaced by the letter 'D', the letter 'B' is replaced by the letter 'F', the letter 'C' is replaced by the letter 'I', and so on. If the plaintext message \"MEET ME IN THE PARK\" is encrypted using this cipher, what is the corresponding ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext, we need to replace each letter in the plaintext message with the corresponding letter in the substitution cipher. The given substitutions are:\n\nA -> D\nB -> F\nC -> I\n\nWe can notice a pattern here: each letter is replaced by the letter that is 3 positions ahead in the alphabet. So, we can apply this pattern to the rest of the alphabet:\n\nD -> G\nE -> H\nF -> I\nG -> J\nH -> K\nI -> L\nJ -> M\nK -> N\nL -> O\nM -> P\nN -> Q\nO -> R\nP -> S\nQ -> T\nR -> U\nS -> V\nT -> W\nU -> X\nV -> Y\nW -> Z\nX -> A\nY -> B\nZ -> C\n\nNow, let's replace each letter in the plaintext message \"MEET ME IN THE PARK\" with the corresponding letter in the substitution cipher:\n\nM -> P\nE -> H\nE -> H\nT -> W\n\nM -> P\nE -> H\n\nI -> L\nN -> Q\n\nT -> W\nH -> K\nE -> H\n\nP -> S\nA -> D\nR -> U\nK -> N\n\nSo, the ciphertext is \"PHHW PH LQ WKH SDUN\"."
