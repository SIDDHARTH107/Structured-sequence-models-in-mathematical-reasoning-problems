Then, using the intersection product on X, compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^*(S).",
    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^*(S) of the finite set S of closed subvarieties of X, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Decompose S into its irreducible components: S = S_1 ∪ S_2 ∪ ... ∪ S_n, where each S_j is an irreducible subvariety of X.\n\n2. Compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^*(S_j) for each irreducible component S_j. By assumption, these are already known.\n\n3. Use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the intersection cohomology groups of the union of the irreducible components. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is a long exact sequence that relates the intersection cohomology groups of the union of two (or more) subvarieties to the intersection cohomology groups of the individual subvarieties and their intersections.\n\nFor a pair of subvarieties S_i and S_j, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is given by:\n\n⋯ → IH^k(S_i ∩ S_j) → IH^k(S_i) ⊕ IH^k(S_j) → IH^k(S_i ∪ S_j) → IH^(k+1)(S_i ∩ S_j) → ⋯\n\n4. Compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^*(S) by iteratively applying the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to the irreducible components S_j and their intersections.\n\nNote that the intersection product on X is used implicitly in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence when computing the intersection cohomology groups of the intersections S_i ∩ S_j.\n\nIn summary, to compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^*(S) of a finite set S of closed subvarieties of a projective algebraic variety X, we can decompose S into its irreducible components, use the known intersection cohomology groups of these components, and iteratively apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the intersection cohomology groups of the union of the irreducible components."
