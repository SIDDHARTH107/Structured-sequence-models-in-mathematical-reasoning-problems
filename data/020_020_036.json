    "message_1": "A math student is designing a rectangular water storage tank with a fixed capacity of 1000 liters. If the cost of the material for the base is 2 dollars per square meter and for the sides is 1 dollar per square meter, what dimensions will minimize the cost of the tank?",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular tank be length (L), width (W), and height (H). The volume of the tank is given by V = LWH, and we know that V = 1000 liters. We can convert the volume to cubic meters: 1000 liters = 1 cubic meter.\n\nSo, LWH = 1.\n\nThe cost function for the tank can be determined by considering the cost of the base and the cost of the sides. The base has an area of LW, and the cost is 2 dollars per square meter, so the cost of the base is 2LW. The sides have a combined area of 2LH + 2WH, and the cost is 1 dollar per square meter, so the cost of the sides is (2LH + 2WH). Therefore, the total cost function is:\n\nC(L, W, H) = 2LW + 2LH + 2WH\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function subject to the constraint LWH = 1. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. Define the Lagrangian function:\n\nL(L, W, H, λ) = 2LW + 2LH + 2WH - λ(LWH - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to L, W, H, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂L = 2W + 2H - λWH = 0\n∂L/∂W = 2L + 2H - λLH = 0\n∂L/∂H = 2L + 2W - λLW = 0\n∂L/∂λ = LWH - 1 = 0\n\nWe have a system of four equations with four unknowns (L, W, H, and λ). We can solve this system to find the optimal dimensions that minimize the cost.\n\nFrom the first three equations, we can express λ in terms of L, W, and H:\n\nλ = (2W + 2H) / WH = (2L + 2H) / LH = (2L + 2W) / LW\n\nNow, we can equate the expressions for λ:\n\n(2W + 2H) / WH = (2L + 2H) / LH = (2L + 2W) / LW\n\nFrom the first and second expressions, we get:\n\n(2W + 2H) / WH = (2L + 2H) / LH\n2LH(W + H) = 2WH(L + H)\nL(W + H) = W(L + H)\n\nSince W + H ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by (W + H) and get L = W.\n\nSimilarly, from the second and third expressions, we get:\n\n(2L + 2H) / LH = (2L + 2W) / LW\n2WH(L + H) = 2LH(L + W)\nW(L + H) = H(L + W)\n\nSince L + W ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by (L + W) and get W = H.\n\nSince L = W and W = H, we have L = W = H. Now, we can use the constraint LWH = 1:\n\nL^3 = 1\n\nL = W = H = (1)^(1/3) = 1\n\nSo, the dimensions that minimize the cost of the tank are L = W = H = 1 meter."
