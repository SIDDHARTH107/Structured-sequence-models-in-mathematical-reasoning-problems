    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 35, we know that |G| = 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a group of order p * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups.\n\nFirst, let's check if G is cyclic. If G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩, and the order of g is 35. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 5, 7, and 35.\n\nIf there exists an element of order 35 in G, then G is cyclic. However, if there are no elements of order 35, then G cannot be cyclic. In this case, we can look for elements of order 5 and 7.\n\nLet H be a subgroup of G with order 5, and K be a subgroup of G with order 7. By Cauchy's theorem, there exist elements h in H and k in K such that |h| = 5 and |k| = 7. Since the orders of H and K are prime, both H and K are cyclic, so H ≅ ℤ5 and K ≅ ℤ7.\n\nNow, we can check if G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K. Since the orders of H and K are relatively prime (gcd(5, 7) = 1), their intersection is trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Moreover, the product of the orders of H and K is equal to the order of G (5 * 7 = 35).\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K ≅ ℤ5 × ℤ7. Therefore, G is not cyclic but is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups, with a specific structure of ℤ5 × ℤ7."
