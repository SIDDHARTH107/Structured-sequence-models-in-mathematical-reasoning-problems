We can do this by showing that each element in (A x B) x C can be mapped to a corresponding element in A x (B x C) and vice versa.\n\nConsider an element in (A x B) x C, say ((a, b), c), where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ C. We can map this element to (a, (b, c)) in A x (B x C), where (b, c) ∈ B x C.\n\nSimilarly, consider an element in A x (B x C), say (a, (b, c)), where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ C. We can map this element to ((a, b), c) in (A x B) x C, where (a, b) ∈ A x B.\n\nSince we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of (A x B) x C and A x (B x C), we can conclude that they are equal."
