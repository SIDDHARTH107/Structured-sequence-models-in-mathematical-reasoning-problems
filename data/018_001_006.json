    "message_2": "To determine whether B is a subset of A, we need to check if every element in B is also an element in A. \n\nStep 1: Identify the elements in set A and set B.\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {}\n\nStep 2: Check if every element in B is also in A.\nSince set B is an empty set, it has no elements. By definition, an empty set is a subset of any set, including set A.\n\nTherefore, B is a subset of A."
