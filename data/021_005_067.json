    "message_2": "To approximate the solution of the given ODE at x = 0.2 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.1, we will perform one iteration of the method. The ODE is y' = 2x - y, and the initial condition is y(0) = 1.\n\nLet's denote the function on the right-hand side of the ODE as f(x, y) = 2x - y. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method involves calculating four estimates (k1, k2, k3, k4) at each step and updating the solution using a weighted average of these estimates.\n\nStep 1: Calculate k1, k2, k3, and k4\nk1 = f(x0, y0) = f(0, 1) = 2*0 - 1 = -1\nk2 = f(x0 + h/2, y0 + h*k1/2) = f(0 + 0.1/2, 1 + 0.1*(-1)/2) = f(0.05, 0.95) = 2*0.05 - 0.95 = -0.85\nk3 = f(x0 + h/2, y0 + h*k2/2) = f(0 + 0.1/2, 1 + 0.1*(-0.85)/2) = f(0.05, 0.9575) = 2*0.05 - 0.9575 = -0.8575\nk4 = f(x0 + h, y0 + h*k3) = f(0 + 0.1, 1 + 0.1*(-0.8575)) = f(0.1, 0.91425) = 2*0.1 - 0.91425 = -0.71425\n\nStep 2: Update the solution\ny1 = y0 + h*(k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6 = 1 + 0.1*(-1 + 2*(-0.85) + 2*(-0.8575) - 0.71425)/6 = 1 + 0.1*(-0.9645) = 0.90355\n\nSo, the approximate solution of the given ODE at x = 0.2 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.1 is y(0.2) â‰ˆ 0.90355."
