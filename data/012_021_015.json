    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find a tree decomposition of the graph.\n2. Calculate the size of the largest bag in the tree decomposition.\n3. Subtract 1 from the size of the largest bag to get the treewidth.\n\nA possible tree decomposition for the given graph is as follows:\n\n```\n  {1,2,4}       {2,3,6}\n    |             |\n  {1,2,5}       {2,3,7}\n    |             |\n  {1,2,8}       {3,6,10}\n    |             |\n  {2,8,9}       {3,7,10}\n    |             |\n  {2,3,9}\n```\n\nThe largest bag in this tree decomposition has 3 vertices. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
