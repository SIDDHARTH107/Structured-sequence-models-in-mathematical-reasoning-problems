    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 8 cm and a minor radius of 4 cm. What is the volume of the torus in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nIn this case, the major radius (R) is 8 cm and the minor radius (r) is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 4^2) * (2 * π * 8)\nVolume = (π * 16) * (16 * π)\nVolume = 256 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 256π^2 cubic centimeters."
