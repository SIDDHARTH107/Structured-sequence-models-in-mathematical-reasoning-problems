    "message_2": "Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values, and it has been found to hold true in every case. However, it remains unproven, so there is no known smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. If such a number were found, it would disprove Goldbach's conjecture."
