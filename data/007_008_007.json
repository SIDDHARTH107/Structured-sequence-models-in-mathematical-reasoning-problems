    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nIn our case, p = 31 (which is a prime number) and a = 7. So, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, 7^31 ≡ 7 (mod 31).\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 7^62 is divided by 31. We can rewrite 7^62 as (7^31)^2. Since we know that 7^31 ≡ 7 (mod 31), we can substitute this into our expression:\n\n(7^31)^2 ≡ 7^2 (mod 31)\n\n7^2 = 49, and when we divide 49 by 31, we get a remainder of 18. Therefore, the remainder when 7^62 is divided by 31 is 18."
