    "message_2": "To find the area of the hyperbolic triangle, we first need to find the hyperbolic distance between the remaining pair of vertices, i.e., between (0, 2) and (3, 1). We can use the hyperbolic distance formula for this:\n\nd((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = arcosh(1 + 2 * ( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 ) / ( (1 - x1^2 - y1^2) * (1 - x2^2 - y2^2) ))\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of the vertices (0, 2) and (3, 1):\n\nd((0, 2), (3, 1)) = arcosh(1 + 2 * ( (3 - 0)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 ) / ( (1 - 0^2 - 2^2) * (1 - 3^2 - 1^2) ))\n\nd((0, 2), (3, 1)) = arcosh(1 + 2 * ( 9 + 1 ) / ( -3 * -8 ))\n\nd((0, 2), (3, 1)) = arcosh(1 + 20 / 24)\n\nd((0, 2), (3, 1)) = arcosh(1 + 5/6)\n\nd((0, 2), (3, 1)) = arcosh(11/6)\n\nNow we have all three hyperbolic distances:\n\nd((0, 0), (0, 2)) = ln(3/2)\nd((0, 0), (3, 1)) = ln(10/3)\nd((0, 2), (3, 1)) = arcosh(11/6)\n\nNext, we need to find the angles of the hyperbolic triangle. We can use the hyperbolic cosine law:\n\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) - sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the hyperbolic distances, and C is the angle opposite to c. We can rearrange the formula to find the angle:\n\ncos(C) = (cosh(c) - cosh(a) * cosh(b)) / (sinh(a) * sinh(b))\n\nWe can find all three angles using this formula:\n\ncos(A) = (cosh(ln(3/2)) - cosh(ln(10/3)) * cosh(arcosh(11/6))) / (sinh(ln(10/3)) * sinh(arcosh(11/6)))\ncos(B) = (cosh(ln(10/3)) - cosh(ln(3/2)) * cosh(arcosh(11/6))) / (sinh(ln(3/2)) * sinh(arcosh(11/6)))\ncos(C) = (cosh(arcosh(11/6)) - cosh(ln(3/2)) * cosh(ln(10/3))) / (sinh(ln(3/2)) * sinh(ln(10/3)))\n\nNow we can find the area of the hyperbolic triangle using the Lobachevsky formula:\n\nArea = π - (A + B + C)\n\nPlugging in the angles:\n\nArea = π - (acos(cos(A)) + acos(cos(B)) + acos(cos(C)))\n\nThis will give us the area of the hyperbolic triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 2), and (3, 1)."
