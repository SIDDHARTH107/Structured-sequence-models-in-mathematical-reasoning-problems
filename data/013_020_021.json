    "message_1": "Suppose 100 people participate in a beauty contest game where each person is asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the person whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all chosen numbers. What number should you choose to win the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the chosen numbers as x1, x2, ..., x100. The average of these numbers is:\n\naverage = (x1 + x2 + ... + x100) / 100\n\nThe target number to win the game is two-thirds of the average:\n\ntarget = (2/3) * average = (2/3) * (x1 + x2 + ... + x100) / 100\n\nNow, we need to find the best number to choose in order to be closest to the target. Since all participants are choosing numbers between 0 and 100, the average will also be within this range. Therefore, the target number will be between 0 and (2/3) * 100 = 66.67.\n\nAssuming all participants are rational and aiming to win, they will also choose numbers within this reduced range of 0 to 66.67. This means the new average will be within this range, and the new target will be two-thirds of this new average:\n\nnew_target = (2/3) * new_average\n\nSince the new average is also between 0 and 66.67, the new target will be between 0 and (2/3) * 66.67 â‰ˆ 44.44.\n\nThis process can be repeated, but it will converge to a single number as the range keeps getting smaller. To find this number, we can set up an equation:\n\nx = (2/3) * x\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx / (2/3) = x\nx = 3x / 2\n2x = 3x\nx = 0\n\nHowever, choosing 0 might not be the best strategy, as other players might also think similarly and choose slightly higher numbers. In that case, you might want to choose a number slightly above 0 to have a better chance of winning. But, if all players think this way, the optimal choice will keep increasing. This is known as the \"beauty contest game\" paradox, and there is no definitive answer to the best number to choose, as it depends on the thought process of the other players."
