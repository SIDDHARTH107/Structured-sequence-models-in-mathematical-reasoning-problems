    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 for -π < x < π, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is even, we only need to compute the a_n coefficients. The general formula for the Fourier series of an even function is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity. The coefficients a_n are given by:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x) dx] from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[x^2 dx] from -π to π\n\na_0 = (2/π) * [(x^3)/3] from -π to π\n\na_0 = (2/π) * [(π^3)/3 - (-π^3)/3]\n\na_0 = (2/π) * (2 * π^3) / 3\n\na_0 = (4/3) * π^2\n\nNow, let's compute a_n for n ≥ 1:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[x^2 * cos(n * x) dx] from -π to π\n\nTo compute this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x^2, dv = cos(n * x) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[x^2 * cos(n * x) dx] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\n= x^2 * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - ∫[(1/n) * sin(n * x) * 2x dx]\n\nNow, we need to use integration by parts again:\n\nu = 2x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\n∫[(1/n) * sin(n * x) * 2x dx] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\n= -2x * (1/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫[-(1/n) * cos(n * x) * 2 dx]\n\n= -2x * (1/n) * cos(n * x) + (2/n) * ∫[cos(n * x) dx]\n\n= -2x * (1/n) * cos(n * x) + (2/n^2) * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[x^2 * cos(n * x) dx] = x^2 * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - (-2x * (1/n) * cos(n * x) + (2/n^2) * sin(n * x))\n\nNow, we can compute a_n:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [x^2 * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - (-2x * (1/n) * cos(n * x) + (2/n^2) * sin(n * x))] from -π to π\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 and sin(n * (-π)) = 0 for all integer values of n, the terms containing sin(n * x) will be zero after evaluating the integral. Therefore, we only need to consider the term containing cos(n * x):\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(-2x * (1/n) * cos(n * x))] from -π to π\n\na_n = (4/n) * [(π * cos(n * π) - (-π * cos(n * (-π))]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n and cos(n * (-π)) = (-1)^n, we get:\n\na_n = (4/n) * [(π * (-1)^n - (-π * (-1)^n)]\n\na_n = (4/n) * [2 * π * (-1)^n]\n\na_n = (-8 * π * (-1)^n) / n\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 for -π < x < π is:\n\nf(x) = (4/3) * π^2 + Σ[(-8 * π * (-1)^n) / n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
