    "message_1": "An object is moving under the influence of a force given by $F(x) = x^2$ where $x$ is the displacement of the object from a fixed point. Find the work done by this force as the object moves from $x = 0$ to $x = 5$.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to integrate the force function with respect to displacement from the initial position to the final position. In this case, the initial position is $x = 0$ and the final position is $x = 5$. The work done by the force is given by:\n\n$W = \\int_{x=0}^{x=5} F(x) \\, dx$\n\nSince $F(x) = x^2$, we have:\n\n$W = \\int_{0}^{5} x^2 \\, dx$\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivative of $x^2$:\n\n$\\int x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + C$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n\n$W = \\left[\\frac{1}{3}x^3\\right]_0^5 = \\frac{1}{3}(5^3) - \\frac{1}{3}(0^3) = \\frac{1}{3}(125) = \\frac{125}{3}$\n\nSo, the work done by the force as the object moves from $x = 0$ to $x = 5$ is $\\frac{125}{3}$ joules."
