    "message_1": "A town has a population of 10,000 people. Suppose that the rate of new infections of a disease is proportional to the number of people who are susceptible to the disease, and that the rate at which people recover from the disease is proportional to the number of infected people. After one week, 800 people have been infected and 200 have recovered. Find the number of infected people after two weeks.",
    "message_2": "Let S be the number of susceptible people, I be the number of infected people, and R be the number of recovered people. We are given that the rate of new infections is proportional to the number of susceptible people, and the rate of recovery is proportional to the number of infected people. We can write these relationships as:\n\ndI/dt = k1 * S\ndR/dt = k2 * I\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are constants of proportionality.\n\nAfter one week, we are given that 800 people have been infected and 200 have recovered. So, initially, S = 10000 - 800 = 9200, I = 800, and R = 200.\n\nWe can use the given information to find the values of k1 and k2. We know that after one week, 800 people have been infected, so:\n\n800 = k1 * 9200 * 1 (since dI/dt = k1 * S and we are considering a time period of 1 week)\n\nk1 = 800 / 9200 = 2/23\n\nSimilarly, we know that after one week, 200 people have recovered, so:\n\n200 = k2 * 800 * 1 (since dR/dt = k2 * I and we are considering a time period of 1 week)\n\nk2 = 200 / 800 = 1/4\n\nNow, we need to find the number of infected people after two weeks. We can use the equations dI/dt = k1 * S and dR/dt = k2 * I to set up a system of differential equations:\n\ndI/dt = (2/23) * S\ndR/dt = (1/4) * I\n\nWe also know that S + I + R = 10000 (since the total population is constant). After one week, S = 9200, I = 800, and R = 200. We can use this information to find the values of S, I, and R after two weeks.\n\nSince dR/dt = (1/4) * I, we can find the change in the number of recovered people after the second week:\n\ndR = (1/4) * 800 * 1 = 200\n\nSo, after two weeks, R = 200 + 200 = 400.\n\nNow, we can find the change in the number of infected people after the second week using dI/dt = (2/23) * S:\n\ndI = (2/23) * 9200 * 1 = 800\n\nHowever, since 200 people recovered during the second week, the actual increase in the number of infected people is:\n\ndI - dR = 800 - 200 = 600\n\nSo, after two weeks, I = 800 + 600 = 1400.\n\nTherefore, the number of infected people after two weeks is 1400."
