    "message_1": "In a certain company, the probability of an employee committing financial fraud is 0.05. If the company has 100 employees, what is the probability that at least 2 employees will commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 employees will commit financial fraud, we can first find the probability that 0 or 1 employee commits financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet P(x) be the probability of x employees committing financial fraud.\n\nP(0) = (0.95)^100, since each of the 100 employees has a 0.95 probability of not committing financial fraud.\n\nNext, we need to find P(1). This is the probability that exactly 1 employee commits financial fraud and the other 99 do not. There are 100 ways to choose which employee commits financial fraud (100 choose 1), so we have:\n\nP(1) = (100 choose 1) * (0.05)^1 * (0.95)^99\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 employees committing financial fraud:\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - (0.95)^100 - (100 choose 1) * (0.05)^1 * (0.95)^99\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(at least 2) ≈ 1 - 0.00673 - 0.2843\n\nP(at least 2) ≈ 0.70897\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 employees will commit financial fraud is approximately 0.709 or 70.9%."
