    "message_2": "The period-doubling constant, also known as the Feigenbaum constant (δ), is a universal constant that appears in the study of bifurcation diagrams and chaotic systems, such as the logistic map. It is approximately equal to 4.669.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking for the value of the logistic map at a specific value of r (3.57), not the period-doubling constant itself. The logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nxₙ₊₁ = r * xₙ * (1 - xₙ)\n\nTo find the approximate value of xₙ₊₁ for r = 3.57, we would need an initial value for xₙ (x₀). Since this information is not provided, we cannot calculate the value of the logistic map for r = 3.57."
