    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x - 1 on the interval [-1, 1], we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, n is an integer, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, L = 1, so the Fourier series representation is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx) + b_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nTo find a_0, we use the formula:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0) dx] from -L to L\n\na_0 = (1/1) * ∫[(x - 1) dx] from -1 to 1\n\na_0 = [0.5x^2 - x] from -1 to 1\n\na_0 = (0.5 - 1) - (0.5 + 1) = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. We use the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from -L to L\n\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from -L to L\n\nFor a_n:\n\na_n = (1/1) * ∫[(x - 1) * cos(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function and cos(nπx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFor b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[(x - 1) * sin(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x - 1, dv = sin(nπx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = [-(x - 1) * (1/nπ) * cos(nπx)] from -1 to 1 + (1/nπ) * ∫[cos(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nThe second term of the equation is zero since the integral of cos(nπx) over a symmetric interval is zero.\n\nb_n = [-(1 - 1) * (1/nπ) * cos(nπ) - (-1 - 1) * (1/nπ) * cos(-nπ)] - 0\n\nb_n = -2 * (1/nπ) * cos(nπ)\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n, we can simplify b_n as:\n\nb_n = (2/nπ) * (-1)^n\n\nNow, we have all the coefficients, and we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x - 1 on the interval [-1, 1]:\n\nf(x) = -1 + Σ [(2/nπ) * (-1)^n * sin(nπx)] for n = 1 to infinity"
