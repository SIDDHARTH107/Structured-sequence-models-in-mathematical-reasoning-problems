    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) + cos(x) = 1, we can use the double angle identity for sine, which is sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So, the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) + cos(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can factor out cos(x) from the equation:\n\ncos(x)(2sin(x) + 1) = 1\n\nFor this equation to be true, either cos(x) = 0 or (2sin(x) + 1) = 1.\n\nCase 1: cos(x) = 0\nx = π/2, 3π/2 (since x lies between 0 and 2π)\n\nCase 2: 2sin(x) + 1 = 1\n2sin(x) = 0\nsin(x) = 0\nx = 0, π (since x lies between 0 and 2π)\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2."
