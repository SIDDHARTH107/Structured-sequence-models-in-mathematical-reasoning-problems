    "message_2": "Since G has 8 edges and H has 7 edges, they have a different number of edges. Two graphs can only be isomorphic if they have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges. Therefore, G and H are not isomorphic, and there is no mapping between the vertices of the two graphs."
