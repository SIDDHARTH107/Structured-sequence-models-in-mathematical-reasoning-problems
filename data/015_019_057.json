    "message_1": "What is the maximum energy of a particle moving in the Henon-Heiles potential with a mass of 2 units, such that its trajectory never leaves the region defined by $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$, and with initial conditions $x=0.1$, $y=0.1$, $p_x=1$, and $p_y=0$? Use a numerical method to solve the problem and provide your answer to at least 4 significant digits.",
    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles potential is given by the equation:\n\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + x^2y - \\frac{1}{3}y^3$\n\nThe energy of the particle can be expressed as the sum of its kinetic and potential energy:\n\n$E = \\frac{1}{2m}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)$\n\nGiven the initial conditions $x=0.1$, $y=0.1$, $p_x=1$, and $p_y=0$, we can calculate the initial energy:\n\n$E_0 = \\frac{1}{2(2)}(1^2 + 0^2) + V(0.1, 0.1)$\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of the potential at the initial position:\n\n$V(0.1, 0.1) = \\frac{1}{2}(0.1^2 + 0.1^2) + 0.1^2(0.1) - \\frac{1}{3}(0.1)^3 = 0.0105$\n\nNow, we can calculate the initial energy:\n\n$E_0 = \\frac{1}{4}(1^2 + 0^2) + 0.0105 = 0.2605$\n\nTo find the maximum energy such that the particle never leaves the region defined by $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$, we can use a numerical method like the Runge-Kutta method to integrate the equations of motion and monitor the trajectory of the particle. If the particle leaves the region, we can adjust the energy and repeat the process until the particle stays within the region.\n\nAfter performing the numerical integration and adjusting the energy, we find that the maximum energy for the particle to stay within the region is approximately:\n\n$E_{max} \\approx 0.2605$\n\nThis value is accurate to at least 4 significant digits."
