    "message_2": "There are two distinct groups of order 4 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. The cyclic group C4 (also denoted as Z4): This group has elements {0, 1, 2, 3} with addition modulo 4 as the operation. It is generated by a single element (1), and every non-identity element has an order of 4.\n\n2. The Klein four-group V4: This group has elements {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and the other elements have order 2. The group operation is defined such that a*a = b*b = c*c = e, and a*b = c, b*c = a, c*a = b. This group is not cyclic, as it does not have an element of order 4.\n\nThese are the only two distinct groups of order 4 up to isomorphism."
