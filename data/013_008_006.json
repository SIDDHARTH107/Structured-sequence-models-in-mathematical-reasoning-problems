    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, five players decide how much money to contribute towards a public project. The project requires a total of $30 to be successful. Each player can contribute any amount between 0 and 10 dollars. The total contribution of all players determines the success of the project and the benefit is shared equally among all players, regardless of their initial contribution. \n\nIf the players are rational and solely interested in maximizing their own payoff, what is the Nash equilibrium contribution for each player?",
    "message_2": "In a Public Goods Game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when each player contributes nothing to the public project, as they all act rationally and try to maximize their own payoff.\n\nHere's why:\n\nLet's assume that each player i contributes x_i dollars to the project, with x_i ∈ [0, 10]. The total contribution is X = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5. If the project is successful (X ≥ 30), each player receives an equal share of the benefit, B. If the project is not successful (X < 30), there is no benefit to share.\n\nEach player's payoff is the benefit they receive minus their contribution: P_i = B/5 - x_i.\n\nNow, let's consider a player's best response to the other players' contributions. If the other players contribute enough to make the project successful without player i's contribution (X - x_i ≥ 30), then player i's best response is to contribute nothing (x_i = 0) because they will still receive the benefit without contributing anything. In this case, P_i = B/5.\n\nIf the other players do not contribute enough to make the project successful without player i's contribution (X - x_i < 30), then player i's best response is still to contribute nothing (x_i = 0) because contributing any amount would not change the outcome of the project and would only decrease their payoff. In this case, P_i = 0.\n\nIn both cases, the best response for each player is to contribute nothing. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is when each player contributes 0 dollars to the public project."
