    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n2x + 3y = 9\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 12\n2x + 3y = 9\n\nWe can see that both equations have the same left-hand side (2x + 3y) but different right-hand sides (12 and 9). This means that the system of linear equations is inconsistent and has no solution."
