    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we are given the distance traveled (80 km) and the time taken (2 hours). We can consider the distance function, d(t), to be continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, 2] (in hours). We want to find the average velocity of the car, which is the average rate of change of the distance function over the interval [0, 2].\n\nThe average rate of change of the distance function is given by:\n\n(Change in distance) / (Change in time) = (d(2) - d(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nSince the car travels 80 km in 2 hours, we have:\n\nd(2) = 80 km\nd(0) = 0 km (initial distance)\n\nSo, the average rate of change (average velocity) is:\n\n(80 - 0) / (2 - 0) = 80 / 2 = 40 km/h\n\nTherefore, the average velocity of the car on this journey is 40 km/h."
