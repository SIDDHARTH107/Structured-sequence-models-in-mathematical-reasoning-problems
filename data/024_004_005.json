    "message_1": "Consider the surface given by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 16. What is the mean curvature of this surface at the point (2, 2, 2)?",
    "message_2": "The given surface is a sphere with radius r = 4 centered at the origin. The equation of the sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2, where r = 4.\n\nTo find the mean curvature, we first need to find the principal curvatures k1 and k2. For a sphere, the principal curvatures are the same and given by the formula:\n\nk1 = k2 = 1/r\n\nIn our case, r = 4, so:\n\nk1 = k2 = 1/4\n\nNow, the mean curvature H is the average of the principal curvatures:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nH = (1/4 + 1/4) / 2\n\nH = 1/4\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (2, 2, 2) is 1/4."
