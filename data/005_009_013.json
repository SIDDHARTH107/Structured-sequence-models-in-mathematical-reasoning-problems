    "message_2": "To find the median score, first arrange the exam scores in ascending order:\n\n51, 55, 55, 58, 59, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 70, 72, 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 80, 82, 85, 88, 89, 90, 92\n\nSince there are 24 students (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle scores. The middle scores are the 12th and 13th scores in the ordered list:\n\n70 and 72\n\nNow, find the average of these two scores:\n\n(70 + 72) / 2 = 142 / 2 = 71\n\nThe median score of the class is 71."
