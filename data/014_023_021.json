    "message_1": "Consider the Rail Fence Cipher, with the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" and a key of 3. If the message is written in rows, how many elements will each row contain?",
    "message_2": "The Rail Fence Cipher with a key of 3 means that the plaintext message will be written in 3 rows. To distribute the letters of \"MATHEMATICS\" (11 letters) evenly among the 3 rows, we can divide 11 by 3.\n\n11 รท 3 = 3 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, the first two rows will have 4 elements each, and the third row will have 3 elements."
