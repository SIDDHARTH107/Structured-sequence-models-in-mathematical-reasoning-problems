    "message_2": "To find the number of sections of the line bundle $L = \\mathcal{O}(P)$ over $E$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for line bundles on elliptic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle $L$ on a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g$, the following equality holds:\n\n$l(L) - l(K_X - L) = \\deg(L) - g + 1$,\n\nwhere $l(L)$ denotes the number of sections of $L$, $K_X$ is the canonical bundle of $X$, and $\\deg(L)$ is the degree of $L$.\n\nIn our case, $X = E$ is an elliptic curve, so its genus $g = 1$. The canonical bundle of an elliptic curve is trivial, meaning $K_E \\cong \\mathcal{O}_E$. Therefore, the Riemann-Roch theorem simplifies to:\n\n$l(L) - l(\\mathcal{O}_E - L) = \\deg(L)$.\n\nSince the degree of $L$ is equal to $3$, we have:\n\n$l(L) - l(\\mathcal{O}_E - L) = 3$.\n\nNow, we need to find $l(\\mathcal{O}_E - L)$. Note that $\\deg(\\mathcal{O}_E - L) = \\deg(\\mathcal{O}_E) - \\deg(L) = 0 - 3 = -3$. Since the degree of $\\mathcal{O}_E - L$ is negative, it has no non-zero sections, so $l(\\mathcal{O}_E - L) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the Riemann-Roch equation, we get:\n\n$l(L) - 0 = 3$.\n\nThus, the number of sections of $L$ over $E$ is $l(L) = 3$."
