    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 357 is divided by 8 using modular arithmetic, we can use the following formula:\n\nremainder = a mod n\n\nwhere a is the number we want to divide, and n is the divisor.\n\nIn this case, a = 357 and n = 8.\n\nremainder = 357 mod 8\n\nTo calculate this, we can divide 357 by 8 and find the remainder:\n\n357 รท 8 = 44 with a remainder of 5.\n\nSo, the remainder when 357 is divided by 8 is 5."
