    "message_1": "A carnival game involves rolling a fair six-sided die. If you roll a 3, you win a stuffed animal. What is the probability of winning the game if you roll the die only once?",
    "message_2": "There is only 1 winning outcome (rolling a 3) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Therefore, the probability of winning the game by rolling the die only once is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667 (rounded to four decimal places)."
