    "message_1": "A factory wants to maximize its profits by producing either product A or product B. The profit for producing product A is $10 per unit, while the profit for producing product B is $15 per unit. The factory has a limited budget of $100,000 to allocate towards production costs. Product A requires $4 of production cost per unit, and product B requires $6 of production cost per unit. What is the maximum profit that the factory can earn and how many units of each product should they produce to achieve this?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe total production cost is given by the equation:\n4x + 6y ≤ 100,000\n\nThe profit function is given by:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the production cost constraint and yield the highest profit.\n\nFirst, we can express y in terms of x using the production cost equation:\ny ≤ (100,000 - 4x) / 6\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the profit function:\nP(x) = 10x + 15((100,000 - 4x) / 6)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\nP(x) = 10x + 15(50,000/3 - 2x/3)\nP(x) = 10x + 250,000 - 10x\nP(x) = 250,000\n\nSince the profit function does not depend on x, we can maximize the profit by producing as many units of product B as possible, given the production cost constraint.\n\nTo find the maximum number of units of product B that can be produced, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n6y ≤ 100,000\ny ≤ 16,666.67\n\nSince the factory can only produce whole units, they should produce 16,666 units of product B.\n\nThe maximum profit the factory can earn is:\nP = 15 * 16,666 = $250,000"
