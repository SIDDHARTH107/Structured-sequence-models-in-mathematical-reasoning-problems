    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [3 - λ, -2; 1, 4 - λ]\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\n|(A - λI)| = (3 - λ)(4 - λ) - (-2)(1) = λ^2 - 7λ + 10\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 10 = 0\n\nThis factors to:\n\n(λ - 2)(λ - 5) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 5.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n\n(A - 2I)v1 = 0\n\n[1, -2; 1, 2]v1 = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\nv1 - 2v2 = 0\nv1 + 2v2 = 0\n\nWe can choose v2 = 1, then v1 = 2. So, the eigenvector v1 is [2; 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 5:\n\n(A - 5I)v2 = 0\n\n[-2, -2; 1, -1]v2 = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\n-2v1 - 2v2 = 0\nv1 - v2 = 0\n\nWe can choose v2 = 1, then v1 = 1. So, the eigenvector v2 is [1; 1].\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 5, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [2; 1] and v2 = [1; 1]."
