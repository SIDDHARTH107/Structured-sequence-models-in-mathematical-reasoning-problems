    "message_1": "A 10 Newton force is applied to move an object in the positive x-direction for a distance of 5 meters. Determine the total work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To determine the total work done by the force, we can use the formula for work, which is:\n\nW = ∫F dx\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force, and dx is the distance moved in the x-direction.\n\nIn this case, the force F is constant at 10 Newtons, and the object is moved a distance of 5 meters in the positive x-direction. So, we can set up the integral as follows:\n\nW = ∫(10) dx from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nW = [10x] from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nNext, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = (10 * 5) - (10 * 0)\nW = 50 - 0\nW = 50 Joules\n\nSo, the total work done by the force is 50 Joules."
