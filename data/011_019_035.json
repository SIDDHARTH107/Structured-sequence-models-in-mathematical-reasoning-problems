    "message_1": "Suppose you are designing a new experiment to test the effects of fertilizer on the growth of crops. You have five different types of fertilizer, but you want to minimize the number of experiments you conduct while still obtaining accurate results. Using an orthogonal array with 4 columns, what is the minimum number of experiments you need to run in order to test all 5 fertilizers?",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of experiments required to test all 5 fertilizers using an orthogonal array with 4 columns, we need to find an orthogonal array that can accommodate the 5 levels (fertilizers) in each of the 4 columns.\n\nAn orthogonal array is represented as OA(N, k, s^t), where N is the number of experiments, k is the number of columns (factors), s is the number of levels, and t is the strength of the array.\n\nIn this case, we have k = 4 columns and s = 5 levels. We need to find the smallest N that can accommodate these parameters.\n\nA suitable orthogonal array for this problem is OA(25, 4, 5^1), which has N = 25 experiments. This array has 4 columns and can accommodate 5 levels in each column.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of experiments you need to run in order to test all 5 fertilizers using an orthogonal array with 4 columns is 25."
