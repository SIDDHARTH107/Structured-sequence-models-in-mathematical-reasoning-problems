    "message_2": "The given function f(t) is already in the sum of sinusoids form, which is the time-domain representation of the signal. We can directly read the amplitudes and frequencies of the different components without needing to apply the Fourier transform.\n\nThe function f(t) can be written as:\n\nf(t) = A0 + A1cos(2πf1t) + A2sin(2πf2t)\n\nComparing this with the given function:\n\nf(t) = 2 + 4cos(1000πt) + 3sin(2000πt)\n\nWe can identify the amplitudes and frequencies of the different components:\n\n1. Constant component (DC component):\nA0 = 2\n\n2. Cosine component:\nA1 = 4\nFrequency: 2πf1 = 1000π => f1 = 500 Hz\n\n3. Sine component:\nA2 = 3\nFrequency: 2πf2 = 2000π => f2 = 1000 Hz\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of the different components of the signal are:\n\n1. Constant component (DC component): Amplitude = 2\n2. Cosine component: Amplitude = 4, Frequency = 500 Hz\n3. Sine component: Amplitude = 3, Frequency = 1000 Hz"
