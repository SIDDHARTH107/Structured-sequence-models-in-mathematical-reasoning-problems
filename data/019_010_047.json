    "message_2": "To prove the statement, we need to find two nonzero vectors v and w in R^3 such that their dot product is zero. Recall that the dot product of two vectors is given by:\n\nv·w = |v||w|cos(θ)\n\nwhere |v| and |w| are the magnitudes of the vectors v and w, and θ is the angle between them. The dot product is zero if and only if the angle between the two vectors is 90 degrees (i.e., they are orthogonal).\n\nLet's consider two nonzero vectors in R^3:\n\nv = (1, 0, 0)\nw = (0, 1, 0)\n\nNow, let's compute their dot product:\n\nv·w = (1)(0) + (0)(1) + (0)(0) = 0\n\nSince the dot product of these two nonzero vectors is zero, the statement is true. There exist two nonzero vectors, v and w, in R^3 such that v·w=0."
