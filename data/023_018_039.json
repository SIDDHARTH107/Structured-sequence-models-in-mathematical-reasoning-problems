    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input signal, we first need to find the frequency response of the system. The frequency response is obtained by substituting s = jω in the transfer function H(s), where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe input sinusoidal signal can be represented as x(t) = 2cos(2πt). Using the Fourier transform, we can represent this signal in the frequency domain as X(jω) = π[δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)], where δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, let's find the frequency response H(jω) by substituting s = jω in the given transfer function:\n\nH(jω) = (5(jω) + 2) / ((jω)^2 + 6(jω) + 8)\n\nNow, we find the output in the frequency domain Y(jω) by multiplying the input X(jω) with the frequency response H(jω):\n\nY(jω) = H(jω) * X(jω) = H(jω) * π[δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nTo find the steady-state response in the time domain, we take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω):\n\ny(t) = F^(-1)[Y(jω)] = F^(-1)[H(jω) * π[δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]]\n\nSince the inverse Fourier transform is a linear operation, we can write:\n\ny(t) = π * [H(j(2π)) * e^(j(2πt)) + H(j(-2π)) * e^(-j(2πt))]\n\nNow, we need to find H(j(2π)) and H(j(-2π)):\n\nH(j(2π)) = (5(j(2π)) + 2) / ((j(2π))^2 + 6(j(2π)) + 8)\nH(j(-2π)) = (5(j(-2π)) + 2) / ((j(-2π))^2 + 6(j(-2π)) + 8)\n\nAfter calculating the values, we get:\n\nH(j(2π)) ≈ 0.0385 - 0.154j\nH(j(-2π)) ≈ 0.0385 + 0.154j\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression for y(t):\n\ny(t) = π * [(0.0385 - 0.154j) * e^(j(2πt)) + (0.0385 + 0.154j) * e^(-j(2πt))]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get the steady-state response in the time domain:\n\ny(t) = 0.077cos(2πt) - 0.308sin(2πt)\n\nSo, the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input signal of frequency 1Hz and amplitude 2 units is y(t) = 0.077cos(2πt) - 0.308sin(2πt)."
