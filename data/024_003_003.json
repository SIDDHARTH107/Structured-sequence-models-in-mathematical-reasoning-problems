    "message_2": "To calculate the Gaussian curvature of the surface defined by the equation z = x^2 + y^2, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives with respect to u and v:\n\nS_u = (∂S/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nS_v = (∂S/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = <S_u, S_u> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <S_u, S_v> = 4uv\nG = <S_v, S_v> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we find the second derivatives:\n\nS_uu = (∂²S/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nS_uv = (∂²S/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 2)\nS_vv = (∂²S/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <S_uu, N> = -2/(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)^(3/2)\nM = <S_uv, N> = -4uv/(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)^(3/2)\nN = <S_vv, N> = -2/(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)^(3/2)\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the coefficients, we get:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nL = -2/(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2)^(3/2) = -2/9\nM = -4(1)(1)/(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2)^(3/2) = -4/9\nN = -2/(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2)^(3/2) = -2/9\n\nNow, we can calculate the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = ((-2/9)(-2/9) - (-4/9)^2) / (5*5 - 4^2)\nK = (4/81 - 16/81) / (25 - 16)\nK = (-12/81) / 9\nK = -12/729\n\nThus, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1, 2) is K = -12/729."
