    "message_2": "The statement is False.\n\nProof by contradiction: Suppose there exists a closed 1-form $\\beta$ on $M$ such that $\\eta = d\\beta$ and $\\alpha = [\\beta]$ in $H^2_{dR}(M)$. Since $\\eta$ is not exact, there is no 0-form $\\gamma$ on $M$ such that $\\eta = d\\gamma$. However, by our assumption, $\\eta = d\\beta$, which contradicts the fact that $\\eta$ is not exact.\n\nFurthermore, since $\\alpha \\wedge \\eta = 0$, we have that $\\alpha \\wedge d\\beta = 0$. Since $\\alpha$ is a closed 2-form, $d\\alpha = 0$. Now, if $\\alpha = [\\beta]$ in $H^2_{dR}(M)$, then $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are cohomologous, which means there exists a 1-form $\\delta$ such that $\\alpha - \\beta = d\\delta$. But this would imply that $\\alpha \\wedge d\\beta = d\\delta \\wedge d\\beta = 0$, which contradicts the fact that $\\alpha \\wedge \\eta = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false, and there does not exist a closed 1-form $\\beta$ on $M$ such that $\\eta = d\\beta$ and $\\alpha = [\\beta]$ in $H^2_{dR}(M)$."
