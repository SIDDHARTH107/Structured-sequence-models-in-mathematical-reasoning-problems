    "message_2": "To show that X is a normal space, we need to prove that for any two disjoint closed subsets A and B of X, there exist disjoint open subsets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\n(⇒) Suppose X is a normal space. By definition, for any two disjoint closed subsets A and B of X, there exist disjoint open subsets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. This is exactly what we need to prove, so the forward direction is done.\n\n(⇐) Now suppose that for any two disjoint closed subsets A and B of X, there exist disjoint open subsets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. We need to show that X is a normal space.\n\nLet A and B be any two disjoint closed subsets of X. By our assumption, there exist disjoint open subsets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. Since A and B are closed, their complements, X \\ A and X \\ B, are open. Note that U = X \\ A and V = X \\ B, as A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nNow, we have that A ∩ V = ∅ and B ∩ U = ∅, since A and B are disjoint and U and V are disjoint. This means that A ⊆ X \\ V and B ⊆ X \\ U. Since X \\ V and X \\ U are open, we have shown that any two disjoint closed subsets of X can be separated by open sets, which is the definition of a normal space.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that a topological space X is normal if and only if for any two disjoint closed subsets A and B of X, there exist disjoint open subsets U and V such that A is a subset of U and B is a subset of V."
