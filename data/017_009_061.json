    "message_2": "First, we will show that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. Let G be a group of order 9, and let g be an element in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of g must divide the order of G, which is 9. Therefore, the possible orders of g are 1, 3, and 9. If there exists an element g in G with order 9, then G is generated by g and is thus a cyclic group isomorphic to C9.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there is no element of order 9 in G. In this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 3. Let G = {e, a, a^2, b, b^2, c, c^2, d, d^2} where e is the identity element, and a, b, c, and d are elements of order 3. We can define the group operation as follows:\n\n1. a^3 = b^3 = c^3 = d^3 = e\n2. ab = ba = c\n3. ac = ca = d\n4. ad = da = b\n5. bc = cb = a\n6. bd = db = c\n7. cd = dc = d\n\nThis group is non-abelian, as we can see from the operation table (e.g., ab â‰  ba). Therefore, G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 9 is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 or to a non-abelian group of order 9, as demonstrated by the explicit examples provided."
