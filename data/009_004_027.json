    "message_1": "A 500-gram mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 100 N/m. The mass is initially displaced 5 cm from its equilibrium position and released. Find the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting oscillations.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting oscillations, we can use the following formulas:\n\nAmplitude (A) is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, which is given as 5 cm or 0.05 m.\n\nThe period (T) of oscillation can be found using the formula:\n\nT = 2π√(m/k)\n\nwhere m is the mass (0.5 kg) and k is the spring constant (100 N/m).\n\nT = 2π√(0.5/100)\nT ≈ 0.4472 seconds\n\nThe frequency (f) of oscillation is the reciprocal of the period:\n\nf = 1/T\n\nf ≈ 1/0.4472\nf ≈ 2.236 Hz\n\nSo, the amplitude is 0.05 m, the period is approximately 0.4472 seconds, and the frequency is approximately 2.236 Hz."
