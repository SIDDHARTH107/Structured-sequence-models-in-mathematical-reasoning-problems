    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of the 20 systems will fail, we can first find the probability that none of them will fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single system will not fail is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nThe probability that all 20 systems will not fail is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one system will fail by subtracting the probability that none of them will fail from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 20 systems will fail is approximately 64.15%."
