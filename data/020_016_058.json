A circular hole of diameter 'd' is to be made in the sheet such that the remaining material is able to withstand a load of 100 N. Find the maximum possible value of 'd' for which the remaining material can support the load.\n\n(Note: Assume the material has a Young's modulus of 70 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3)\n\nA diagram can be provided for the metal sheet and hole for better visual understanding.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the stress concentration factor (Kt) formula for a plate with a circular hole under uniaxial tension. The formula is:\n\nKt = (1 + 2 * (a / r))\n\nwhere 'a' is the radius of the hole, 'r' is the distance from the center of the hole to the edge of the plate, and Kt is the stress concentration factor.\n\nFirst, we need to find the stress (σ) in the remaining material when the load is applied. The stress can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσ = F / A\n\nwhere F is the applied force (100 N) and A is the cross-sectional area of the remaining material.\n\nSince the metal sheet is a square of side 4 cm, the total area of the sheet is 16 cm². The area of the circular hole is (π * (d/2)²). Therefore, the area of the remaining material (A) is:\n\nA = 16 - π * (d/2)²\n\nNow, we can calculate the stress (σ) in the remaining material:\n\nσ = 100 / (16 - π * (d/2)²)\n\nNext, we need to find the maximum stress (σ_max) that the material can withstand. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσ_max = Kt * σ\n\nwhere Kt is the stress concentration factor.\n\nSince we want to find the maximum possible value of 'd' for which the remaining material can support the load, we need to find the value of 'd' that makes σ_max equal to the material's yield strength (σ_yield). The yield strength can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσ_yield = E / (2 * (1 + ν))\n\nwhere E is the Young's modulus (70 GPa) and ν is the Poisson's ratio (0.3).\n\nσ_yield = (70 * 10^9) / (2 * (1 + 0.3))\nσ_yield ≈ 1.346 * 10^9 Pa\n\nNow, we need to find the value of 'd' that makes σ_max equal to σ_yield:\n\n1.346 * 10^9 = Kt * (100 / (16 - π * (d/2)²))\n\nSince 'a' is half of the diameter (d/2) and 'r' is the distance from the center of the hole to the edge of the plate (which is half of the side of the square, 2 cm), we can rewrite the stress concentration factor (Kt) formula as:\n\nKt = (1 + 2 * ((d/2) / 2))\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for Kt into the equation for σ_max:\n\n1.346 * 10^9 = (1 + 2 * ((d/2) / 2)) * (100 / (16 - π * (d/2)²))\n\nTo find the maximum possible value of 'd', we can solve this equation numerically. Using a numerical solver, we find that:\n\nd ≈ 2.24 cm\n\nSo, the maximum possible value of 'd' for which the remaining material can support the load is approximately 2.24 cm."
