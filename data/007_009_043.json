    "message_2": "Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. We are given that φ(n) = 12, and we want to find the smallest possible value of n.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of the Euler's totient function:\n\n1. If p is a prime number, then φ(p) = p - 1.\n2. If p and q are distinct prime numbers, then φ(pq) = (p - 1)(q - 1).\n3. If p is a prime number and k is a positive integer, then φ(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1).\n\nNow, let's consider the prime factorization of n. If n has only one prime factor, say n = p^k, then φ(n) = p^k - p^(k-1). Since φ(n) = 12, we have p^k - p^(k-1) = 12. However, there are no prime numbers p and positive integers k that satisfy this equation.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where n has two distinct prime factors, say n = pq. Then φ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1). Since φ(n) = 12, we have (p - 1)(q - 1) = 12. The possible factor pairs of 12 are (1, 12), (2, 6), and (3, 4). We can reverse the subtraction in each factor to find the possible values of p and q:\n\n1. (p - 1, q - 1) = (1, 12) => (p, q) = (2, 13)\n2. (p - 1, q - 1) = (2, 6) => (p, q) = (3, 7)\n3. (p - 1, q - 1) = (3, 4) => (p, q) = (4, 5), but this is not valid since 4 is not a prime number.\n\nThe smallest possible value of n is obtained from the second case, where (p, q) = (3, 7). Therefore, the smallest possible value of n is n = 3 × 7 = 21."
