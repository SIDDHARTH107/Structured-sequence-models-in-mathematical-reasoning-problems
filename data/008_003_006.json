    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by row reducing the matrix to its row echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n[1 2 3]\n[4 5 6]\n[7 8 9]\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and 7 times the first row from the third row.\n\n[1  2  3]\n[0 -3 -6]\n[0 -6 -12]\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3.\n\n[1  2   3]\n[0  1   2]\n[0 -6 -12]\n\nStep 3: Add 6 times the second row to the third row, and subtract 2 times the second row from the first row.\n\n[1  0  -1]\n[0  1   2]\n[0  0   0]\n\nThe row echelon form of matrix A is:\n\n[1  0  -1]\n[0  1   2]\n[0  0   0]\n\nThere are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of matrix A is 2."
