    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle, also known as the circumference, can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius of 7 meters, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2π(7)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 7\nC ≈ 43.98226\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 43.98 meters."
