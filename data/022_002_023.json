    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle $|z-1|=2$ under the conformal mapping $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2-4z+3}$, we first need to find the inverse of the mapping. Let $w = f(z)$. Then, we have:\n\n$w = \\frac{1}{z^2-4z+3}$\n\nNow, we solve for $z$ in terms of $w$:\n\n$1 = w(z^2-4z+3)$\n\n$z^2-4z+3 = \\frac{1}{w}$\n\n$z^2-4z+3-w = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $z$. We can use the quadratic formula to find the inverse mapping:\n\n$z = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(3-w)}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 12 + 4w}}{2}$\n\nNow, we can find the image of the circle $|z-1|=2$ under the inverse mapping. Let $z' = z-1$. Then, the circle is given by $|z'|=2$. We can write $z'$ in polar form as $z' = 2e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the positive real axis. Then, $z = 2e^{i\\theta} + 1$.\n\nSubstitute this expression for $z$ into the inverse mapping:\n\n$z = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 12 + 4w}}{2} = 2e^{i\\theta} + 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $w$:\n\n$w = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 12 + 4(2e^{i\\theta} + 1)}}{2(2e^{i\\theta} + 1)}$\n\nSince we are looking for the image of the circle, we are interested in the boundary of the region. We can find this by taking the limit as $\\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$:\n\n$w(\\theta) = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 12 + 4(2e^{i\\theta} + 1)}}{2(2e^{i\\theta} + 1)}$\n\nAs $\\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$, the image of the circle will trace out a curve in the complex plane. To find the equation of this curve, we can eliminate $\\theta$ from the equation above. We can do this by squaring both sides and simplifying:\n\n$|w(\\theta)|^2 = \\left|\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 12 + 4(2e^{i\\theta} + 1)}}{2(2e^{i\\theta} + 1)}\\right|^2$\n\nAfter simplifying, we get:\n\n$|w(\\theta)|^2 = \\frac{16}{(4e^{i\\theta} + 2)^2}$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n$|w(\\theta)| = \\frac{4}{4e^{i\\theta} + 2}$\n\nThis is the equation of the image of the circle $|z-1|=2$ under the conformal mapping $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2-4z+3}$. The image is a circle in the complex plane with radius $\\frac{4}{4e^{i\\theta} + 2}$, which is a circle in the unit disk."
