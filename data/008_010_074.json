    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations to transform the given system into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations:\n\n| 1  1  1 |  6 |\n| 2  3  4 | 20 |\n| 3  5  6 | 30 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 3 * Row1\n\n| 1  1   1  |  6  |\n| 0  1   2  |  8  |\n| 0  2   3  | 12  |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 - 2 * Row2\n\n| 1  1   1  |  6  |\n| 0  1   2  |  8  |\n| 0  0  -1  | -4  |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 4: Solve for z:\n\n-1z = -4\nz = 4\n\nStep 5: Solve for y:\n\ny + 2z = 8\ny + 2(4) = 8\ny + 8 = 8\ny = 0\n\nStep 6: Solve for x:\n\nx + y + z = 6\nx + 0 + 4 = 6\nx = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 0, and z = 4."
