    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example question:\n\nIn a Trust Game, Player A is given $100 and must decide how much money to send to Player B. Player B receives three times the amount sent by Player A and must decide how much of that to keep for themselves and how much to return to Player A. If Player B returns all of the money they received from Player A, both players get to keep their remaining money. What is the optimal amount for Player A to send if they want to maximize the total amount of money kept by both players?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total amount of money kept by both players, Player A should send the entire $100 to Player B. This is because Player B will receive three times the amount sent, so they will receive $300. If Player B returns all the money they received from Player A, both players will get to keep their remaining money.\n\nIn this case, Player A will have $0 left, and Player B will have $300. The total amount of money kept by both players will be $300, which is the maximum possible amount in this game."
