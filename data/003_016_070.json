    "message_2": "The general form of a sinusoidal function is f(x) = A * sin(B * (x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given function, f(x) = 2sin(3x - π/4), we can see that A = 2, B = 3, and the expression inside the sine function is (3x - π/4). To find the phase shift, we need to determine the value of C.\n\nWe can rewrite the expression inside the sine function as 3 * (x - C) by factoring out the 3:\n\n3x - π/4 = 3 * (x - C)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\nx - π/12 = x - C\n\nComparing the two expressions, we can see that the phase shift C is π/12. Therefore, the phase shift of the function is π/12."
