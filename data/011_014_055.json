    "message_1": "A graph has 7 vertices and 9 edges. How many possible ways are there for this graph to be colored using 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the chromatic polynomial. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a graph G is a polynomial in the variable k that counts the number of proper k-colorings of G. In this case, we have a graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges, and we want to find the number of proper 4-colorings.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, it is impossible to find the exact chromatic polynomial or the number of proper 4-colorings. The graph's structure plays a crucial role in determining the chromatic polynomial and the number of colorings.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the graph's structure or the arrangement of the vertices and edges, we can help you find the number of proper 4-colorings."
