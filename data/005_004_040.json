    "message_1": "An electronics manufacturer wants to compare the mean lifetime of four different brands of smartphones. They selected a sample of 15 smartphones from each brand and recorded their lifetimes in months. Perform a one-way ANOVA to test whether there are significant differences among the mean lifetimes of the four brands at a 5% level of significance. The following table shows the lifetimes of smartphones for each brand:\n\n| Brand 1 | Brand 2 | Brand 3 | Brand 4 |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 27.6    | 23.7    | 19.4    | 22.4    |\n| 21.5    | 20.5    | 20.5    | 24.5    |\n| 28.4    | 25.4    | 23.5    | 20.5    |\n| 23.4    | 22.4    | 18.4    | 18.3    |\n| 21.5    | 21.5    | 22.5    | 25.5    |\n| 24.6    | 22.6    | 24.6    | 23.6    |\n| 22.5    | 20.5    | 18.5    | 21.5    |\n| 21.6    | 23.6    | 26.6    | 19.6    |\n| 26.7    | 24.7    | 21.7    | 22.7    |\n| 23.8    | 22.8    | 23.8    | 27.8    |\n| 20.9    | 21.9    | 20.9    | 22.9    |\n| 30.1    | 29.1    | 26.1    | 23.1    |\n| 26.2    | 20.2    | 23.2    | 25.2    |\n| 22.3    | 25.3    | 26.3    | 21.3    |\n| 24.4    | 23.4    | 27.4    | 20.4    |",
    "message_2": "To perform a one-way ANOVA, we first need to calculate the means and variances for each brand, as well as the overall mean.\n\nMean of Brand 1: (27.6 + 21.5 + 28.4 + 23.4 + 21.5 + 24.6 + 22.5 + 21.6 + 26.7 + 23.8 + 20.9 + 30.1 + 26.2 + 22.3 + 24.4) / 15 = 24.24\nMean of Brand 2: (23.7 + 20.5 + 25.4 + 22.4 + 21.5 + 22.6 + 20.5 + 23.6 + 24.7 + 22.8 + 21.9 + 29.1 + 20.2 + 25.3 + 23.4) / 15 = 23.16\nMean of Brand 3: (19.4 + 20.5 + 23.5 + 18.4 + 22.5 + 24.6 + 18.5 + 26.6 + 21.7 + 23.8 + 20.9 + 26.1 + 23.2 + 26.3 + 27.4) / 15 = 22.84\nMean of Brand 4: (22.4 + 24.5 + 20.5 + 18.3 + 25.5 + 23.6 + 21.5 + 19.6 + 22.7 + 27.8 + 22.9 + 23.1 + 25.2 + 21.3 + 20.4) / 15 = 22.64\n\nOverall Mean: (24.24 + 23.16 + 22.84 + 22.64) / 4 = 23.22\n\nNext, we calculate the Sum of Squares Within (SSW) and Sum of Squares Between (SSB):\n\nSSW = Σ(Σ(x_ij - mean_i)^2) for each brand i and each observation j\nSSB = Σ(n_i * (mean_i - overall_mean)^2) for each brand i, where n_i is the number of observations in brand i\n\nSSW for Brand 1: Σ(27.6 - 24.24)^2 + ... + Σ(24.4 - 24.24)^2 = 278.84\nSSW for Brand 2: Σ(23.7 - 23.16)^2 + ... + Σ(23.4 - 23.16)^2 = 196.24\nSSW for Brand 3: Σ(19.4 - 22.84)^2 + ... + Σ(27.4 - 22.84)^2 = 324.84\nSSW for Brand 4: Σ(22.4 - 22.64)^2 + ... + Σ(20.4 - 22.64)^2 = 219.84\n\nTotal SSW = 278.84 + 196.24 + 324.84 + 219.84 = 1019.76\n\nSSB = 15 * (24.24 - 23.22)^2 + 15 * (23.16 - 23.22)^2 + 15 * (22.84 - 23.22)^2 + 15 * (22.64 - 23.22)^2 = 34.02\n\nNow we calculate the Mean Squares Within (MSW) and Mean Squares Between (MSB):\n\nMSW = SSW / (total number of observations - number of brands) = 1019.76 / (60 - 4) = 1019.76 / 56 = 18.21\nMSB = SSB / (number of brands - 1) = 34.02 / (4 - 1) = 34.02 / 3 = 11.34\n\nNext, we calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 11.34 / 18.21 = 0.62\n\nFinally, we compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table with degrees of freedom (3, 56) at a 5% level of significance. The critical value is approximately 2.77.\n\nSince the F-statistic (0.62) is less than the critical value (2.77), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference among the mean lifetimes of the four brands at a 5% level of significance."
