The data is shown in the table below:\n\n| Area | Number of Customers | Total Amount Sold ($)| \n|------|-------------------|----------------------| \n| 1    | 100               | 7000                 | \n| 2    | 120               | 8500                 | \n| 3    | 150               | 9000                 | \n| 4    | 80                | 5500                 | \n| 5    | 90                | 6500                 | \n\nUsing cluster analysis, determine which areas have similar patterns of customer behavior and product sales. Based on your analysis, create at least two distinct customer segments by clustering the areas accordingly.",
    "message_2": "To perform a cluster analysis, we can use the k-means clustering algorithm. First, we need to normalize the data to ensure that the variables have equal weight in the analysis. We can normalize the data by dividing each value by the maximum value in its respective column.\n\nNormalized data:\n\n| Area | Number of Customers | Total Amount Sold ($)|\n|------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| 1    | 100/150 = 0.67      | 7000/9000 = 0.78     |\n| 2    | 120/150 = 0.80      | 8500/9000 = 0.94     |\n| 3    | 150/150 = 1.00      | 9000/9000 = 1.00     |\n| 4    | 80/150 = 0.53       | 5500/9000 = 0.61     |\n| 5    | 90/150 = 0.60       | 6500/9000 = 0.72     |\n\nNow, we can apply the k-means clustering algorithm with k=2 (two clusters) to the normalized data. The algorithm will group the areas based on the similarity of their normalized values.\n\nAfter applying the k-means clustering algorithm, we get the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Areas 1, 4, and 5\nCluster 2: Areas 2 and 3\n\nNow, we can create two distinct customer segments based on these clusters:\n\nSegment 1 (Cluster 1): Areas with a moderate number of customers and moderate total amount sold. This segment includes Areas 1, 4, and 5.\n\nSegment 2 (Cluster 2): Areas with a higher number of customers and higher total amount sold. This segment includes Areas 2 and 3.\n\nThese two segments can be used by the marketing company to target different customer groups and develop strategies tailored to each segment."
