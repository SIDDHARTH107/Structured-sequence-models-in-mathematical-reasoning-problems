    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of f(x) and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to determine if these critical points are maximums, minimums, or neither. We do this by analyzing the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nFor x = 1:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, there is a local maximum at x = 1.\n\nFor x = 3:\n\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(3) > 0, there is a local minimum at x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to consider the constraint x >= 0. Since x = 1 is within the constraint and is a local maximum, we can evaluate f(x) at x = 1:\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(x) is 6, and it is achieved at x = 1."
