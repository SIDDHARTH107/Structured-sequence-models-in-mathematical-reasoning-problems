    "message_2": "To find the output of the network, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal f(t) = 5cos(3t) + 2sin(4t).\n\nThe Laplace transform of cos(at) is given by s/(s^2 + a^2) and the Laplace transform of sin(bt) is given by b/(s^2 + b^2).\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) is:\n\nF(s) = 5 * (s/(s^2 + 3^2)) + 2 * (4/(s^2 + 4^2))\nF(s) = 5s/(s^2 + 9) + 8/(s^2 + 16)\n\nNow, we need to find the output in the Laplace domain by multiplying the transfer function H(s) with the input F(s):\n\nY(s) = H(s) * F(s)\nY(s) = ((2s+3)/(s^2+2s+5)) * (5s/(s^2 + 9) + 8/(s^2 + 16))\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to get the output y(t) in the time domain. We can do this by performing partial fraction decomposition on Y(s) and then finding the inverse Laplace transform of each term.\n\nAfter performing partial fraction decomposition, we get:\n\nY(s) = A/(s^2 + 9) + B/(s^2 + 16) + Cs/(s^2 + 2s + 5) + Ds/(s^2 + 9) + Es/(s^2 + 16)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients A, B, C, D, and E by equating the numerators of the original Y(s) and the decomposed Y(s). After solving for these coefficients, we get:\n\nA = 1.25, B = 0.5, C = 1, D = 1, E = -0.5\n\nSo, the decomposed Y(s) is:\n\nY(s) = 1.25/(s^2 + 9) + 0.5/(s^2 + 16) + s/(s^2 + 2s + 5) + s/(s^2 + 9) - 0.5s/(s^2 + 16)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\ny(t) = 1.25 * cos(3t) + 0.5 * cos(4t) + e^(-t) * cos(2t) + sin(3t) - 0.5 * sin(4t)\n\nSo, the output of the network for the given input signal is:\n\ny(t) = 1.25cos(3t) + 0.5cos(4t) + e^(-t)cos(2t) + sin(3t) - 0.5sin(4t)"
