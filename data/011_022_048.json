    "message_1": "A student is packing for a hiking trip and has a backpack that can hold a maximum weight of 10 kg. They have five items to bring, each with a weight and value as follows:\n\n- Item 1: 2 kg, $20\n- Item 2: 3 kg, $30\n- Item 3: 4 kg, $45\n- Item 4: 5 kg, $55\n- Item 5: 6 kg, $70\n\nWhat items should the student bring to maximize the value, given that they can only carry up to 10 kg? Use the Knapsack problem to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming. We will create a table with rows representing the items and columns representing the possible weights from 0 to 10 kg. The cell at the intersection of the ith row and jth column will represent the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items and a maximum weight of j kg.\n\nHere's the table:\n\n```\n  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10\n--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---\n1 | 0 | 0 |20 |20 |20 |20 |20 |20 |20 |20 |20\n2 | 0 | 0 |20 |30 |30 |50 |50 |50 |50 |50 |50\n3 | 0 | 0 |20 |30 |45 |50 |65 |75 |75 |90 |90\n4 | 0 | 0 |20 |30 |45 |55 |65 |80 |85 |95 |100\n5 | 0 | 0 |20 |30 |45 |55 |70 |80 |90 |100|115\n```\n\nThe last cell (115) represents the maximum value that can be obtained using all items and a maximum weight of 10 kg. To find the items that make up this value, we will backtrack through the table:\n\n1. Start at the last cell (115). The value is different from the cell above it (100), so item 5 is included. Subtract the weight of item 5 (6 kg) from the current weight (10 kg) to get 4 kg.\n2. Move to the cell in the row above and the column corresponding to the new weight (4 kg). The value is different from the cell above it (30), so item 4 is included. Subtract the weight of item 4 (5 kg) from the current weight (4 kg) to get -1 kg. Since this is not a valid weight, we stop.\n\nThe optimal solution is to bring items 4 and 5, which have a combined weight of 10 kg and a combined value of $115."
