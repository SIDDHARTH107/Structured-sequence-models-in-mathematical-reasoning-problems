    "message_1": "A thin metallic sheet has a thickness of 0.2 mm and a length of 10 cm. The sheet is subjected to a thermal load that causes temperature variations (in Celsius) that are given by the function f(x) = 100 sin(πx/10), where x is the position along the length of the sheet. \n\nUsing the Fourier transform, find the frequency components of the temperature distribution and determine the amplitude of the first harmonic.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency components of the temperature distribution, we need to compute the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = 100 sin(πx/10). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), i is the imaginary unit, and k is the frequency variable.\n\nFor our function f(x) = 100 sin(πx/10), the Fourier transform is:\n\nF(k) = ∫[100 sin(πx/10) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let:\n\nu = 100 sin(πx/10)\ndv = e^(-2πikx) dx\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = (100 * π/10) cos(πx/10) dx\nv = -1/(2πik) e^(-2πikx)\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\nF(k) = uv - ∫v du\nF(k) = -100/(2πik) sin(πx/10) e^(-2πikx) - ∫[-1/(2πik) e^(-2πikx) * (100 * π/10) cos(πx/10) dx]\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\n∫[-1/(2πik) e^(-2πikx) * (100 * π/10) cos(πx/10) dx]\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\n\n∫[-(100 * π/10) / (2πik) * e^(-2πikx) * cos(πx/10) dx]\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again. Let:\n\nu = cos(πx/10)\ndv = - (100 * π/10) / (2πik) * e^(-2πikx) dx\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = -(π/10) sin(πx/10) dx\nv = - (100 * π/10) / (4π^2k^2) * e^(-2πikx)\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\n∫[-(100 * π/10) / (2πik) * e^(-2πikx) * cos(πx/10) dx] = uv - ∫v du\n\n= - (100 * π/10) / (4π^2k^2) * e^(-2πikx) * cos(πx/10) + (100 * π/10) / (4π^2k^2) * ∫e^(-2πikx) * (π/10) sin(πx/10) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the Fourier transform F(k) at the limits of integration. Since the function is periodic, we can consider the integral over one period, from 0 to 10:\n\nF(k) = [-100/(2πik) sin(πx/10) e^(-2πikx)]_0^10 - (100 * π/10) / (4π^2k^2) * [e^(-2πikx) * cos(πx/10)]_0^10\n\nFor the first term, we have:\n\n[-100/(2πik) sin(πx/10) e^(-2πikx)]_0^10 = 0\n\nThis is because sin(πx/10) is zero at both x = 0 and x = 10.\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n\n(100 * π/10) / (4π^2k^2) * [e^(-2πikx) * cos(πx/10)]_0^10 = 0\n\nThis is because cos(πx/10) is equal to 1 at x = 0 and x = 10, and e^(-2πikx) is equal to 1 at x = 0 and x = 10 for integer values of k.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform F(k) is zero for all frequency components except for k = 0. The amplitude of the first harmonic is the absolute value of F(1), which is also zero. This means that there is no first harmonic in the temperature distribution."
