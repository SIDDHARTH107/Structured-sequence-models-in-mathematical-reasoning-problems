    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n|  2  3  4 | 21\n|  5  7  8 | 54\n|  9 10 12 | 98\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 | 10.5\n|  5  7  8   | 54\n|  9 10 12   | 98\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nSubtract 5 times the first row from the second row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 | 10.5\n|  0  0.5  0 |  2\n|  9 10 12   | 98\n\nSubtract 9 times the first row from the third row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 | 10.5\n|  0  0.5  0 |  2\n|  0 -3.5 -6 | -5.5\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 0.5 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 | 10.5\n|  0  1   0  |  4\n|  0 -3.5 -6 | -5.5\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\nAdd 3.5 times the second row to the third row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 | 10.5\n|  0  1   0  |  4\n|  0  0  -6 |  9\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -6 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 | 10.5\n|  0  1   0  |  4\n|  0  0   1 | -1.5\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can perform back substitution:\n\nStep 6: Eliminate the third element in the first and second rows:\n\nSubtract 2 times the third row from the first row:\n\n|  1  1.5  0 | 13\n|  0  1   0  |  4\n|  0  0   1 | -1.5\n\nSubtract 1.5 times the third row from the second row:\n\n|  1  1.5  0 | 13\n|  0  1   0  |  4\n|  0  0   1 | -1.5\n\nStep 7: Eliminate the second element in the first row:\n\nSubtract 1.5 times the second row from the first row:\n\n|  1  0  0 |  7\n|  0  1  0 |  4\n|  0  0  1 | -1.5\n\nNow, we have the identity matrix, and the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 7\ny = 4\nz = -1.5"
