C_16 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 16 and 3)\n4. C_8 × C_6 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 8 and 6)\n5. C_4 × C_4 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4, 4, and 3)\n6. C_4 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4, 2, 2, and 2)\n7. Q_16 × C_3 (direct product of quaternion group of order 16 and cyclic group of order 3)\n8. D_48 (dihedral group of order 48)\n9. SD_48 (semi-dihedral group of order 48)\n10. C_4 ⋊ C_12 (semi-direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 12)\n\nThese groups can be found using the Sylow theorems and analyzing the possible structures of groups of order 48."
