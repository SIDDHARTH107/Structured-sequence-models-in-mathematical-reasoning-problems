    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products A and B. The production cost of product A is $50 per unit and product B is $60 per unit. The selling price of A and B are $100 and $120, respectively. The company has a fixed budget of $10,000 for production cost. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe production cost constraint is given by:\n50x + 60y ≤ 10,000\n\nThe profit for each unit of product A is $100 - $50 = $50, and the profit for each unit of product B is $120 - $60 = $60. So, the total profit P can be represented as:\nP = 50x + 60y\n\nWe want to maximize the profit P subject to the constraint 50x + 60y ≤ 10,000.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the inequality for y:\ny ≤ (10,000 - 50x) / 60\n\nSince x and y represent the number of units produced, they must be non-negative integers:\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region by setting the inequality to an equation and solving for x and y:\n50x + 60y = 10,000\n\n1. When x = 0:\ny = (10,000 - 50(0)) / 60 = 166.67\nSince y must be an integer, we'll round down to y = 166.\n\n2. When y = 0:\nx = (10,000 - 60(0)) / 50 = 200\n\nSo, the corner points of the feasible region are (0, 166) and (200, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P at these corner points:\n\nP(0, 166) = 50(0) + 60(166) = 9,960\nP(200, 0) = 50(200) + 60(0) = 10,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 200 units of product A and 0 units of product B, with a total profit of $10,000."
