    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nLet's try to color the given graph using as few colors as possible:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, so color it with color B.\n3. Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2, so color it with color A.\n4. Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 6, so color it with color B.\n5. Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 1, 2, and 4, so color it with color C.\n6. Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices 1 and 4, so color it with color A.\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph using 3 colors (A, B, and C). It is not possible to color the graph with only 2 colors since vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices of both colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of this graph is 3."
