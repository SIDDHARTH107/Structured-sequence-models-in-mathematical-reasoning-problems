    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I must clarify that all natural numbers can be represented and computed by a Turing machine with a two-symbol alphabet {0,1}. Turing machines are a theoretical model of computation that can simulate any computer algorithm, and they can represent and manipulate natural numbers using binary representation.\n\nHowever, there are some functions or problems that are not computable by a Turing machine, such as the halting problem. But this does not apply to natural numbers themselves. All natural numbers can be computed by a Turing machine with a two-symbol alphabet."
