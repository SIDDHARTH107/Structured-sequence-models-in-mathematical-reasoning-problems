    "message_2": "The singular quadric surface given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ is a cone in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. To compute its intersection cohomology groups, we can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem and the fact that the intersection cohomology groups of a smooth quadric surface are isomorphic to the cohomology groups of the corresponding projective space.\n\nLet $Q$ be the smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - w^2 = 0$. Then the intersection cohomology groups of $Q$ are given by:\n\n$$IH^i(Q) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbb{Z} & \\text{if } i = 0, 2, 4 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nNow, let $C$ be the singular quadric cone given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$. We can think of $C$ as the intersection of $Q$ with the hyperplane $w = 0$. By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the intersection cohomology groups of $C$ are isomorphic to the cohomology groups of $Q$ in degrees less than 4. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$IH^i(C) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbb{Z} & \\text{if } i = 0, 2 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } i = 1, 3 \\\\\nIH^4(C) & \\text{if } i = 4\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nTo compute $IH^4(C)$, we can use the long exact sequence in intersection cohomology associated to the pair $(Q, C)$. This sequence has the form:\n\n$$\\cdots \\to IH^3(Q) \\to IH^3(C) \\to IH^4(Q \\cap C) \\to IH^4(Q) \\to IH^4(C) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nSince $IH^3(Q) = IH^3(C) = 0$, we have an isomorphism $IH^4(Q \\cap C) \\cong IH^4(Q)$. The intersection $Q \\cap C$ is a smooth quadric curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, so its cohomology groups are given by:\n\n$$IH^i(Q \\cap C) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbb{Z} & \\text{if } i = 0, 2 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nThus, we have $IH^4(C) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. In summary, the intersection cohomology groups of the singular quadric surface $C$ are given by:\n\n$$IH^i(C) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbb{Z} & \\text{if } i = 0, 2, 4 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$"
