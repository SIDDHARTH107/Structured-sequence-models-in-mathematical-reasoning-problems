    "message_1": "What is the probability of a tornado occurring in a particular region if the historical data shows that an average of 5 tornadoes occur each year with a standard deviation of 2 tornadoes? Assuming a normal distribution for the occurrence of tornadoes, what is the probability of having at least 8 tornadoes in the region in a given year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of having at least 8 tornadoes in a given year, we can use the z-score formula and a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table).\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score for 8 tornadoes. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the number of tornadoes we're interested in (8), μ is the mean (5), and σ is the standard deviation (2).\n\nz = (8 - 5) / 2\nz = 3 / 2\nz = 1.5\n\nNow, we'll look up the z-score of 1.5 in a standard normal distribution table. The value we find in the table represents the probability of having 8 or fewer tornadoes in a given year. The value for a z-score of 1.5 is approximately 0.9332.\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of having at least 8 tornadoes, which means we need to find the probability of having more than 8 tornadoes. To do this, we subtract the probability of having 8 or fewer tornadoes from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = 1 - P(X ≤ 8)\nP(X ≥ 8) = 1 - 0.9332\nP(X ≥ 8) ≈ 0.0668\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 8 tornadoes in the region in a given year is approximately 6.68%."
