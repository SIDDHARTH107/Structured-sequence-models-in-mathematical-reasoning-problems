    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{4^{n+1}z^{n+1}}{(n+2)!}}{\\frac{4^{n}z^{n}}{(n+1)!}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{4^{n+1}z^{n+1}(n+1)!}{4^{n}z^{n}(n+2)!}\\right|$$\n\nCancel out the terms:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{4z}{n+2}\\right|$$\n\nFor the series to converge, this limit must be less than 1:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{4z}{n+2}\\right| < 1$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the term (n+2) will dominate, and the limit will be 0. Therefore, the series converges for all z, and the radius of convergence is infinite.\n\nSince the radius of convergence is infinite, the interval of convergence is the entire complex plane, or in terms of real numbers, the interval is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$."
