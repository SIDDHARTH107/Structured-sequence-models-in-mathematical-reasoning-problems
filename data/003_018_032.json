    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = sin(2x), we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x.\n\nThe derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2. So, using the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = d(sin(2x))/dx = cos(2x) * d(2x)/dx = cos(2x) * 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = 2 * cos(2 * π/4) = 2 * cos(π/2)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0, so:\n\nf'(π/4) = 2 * 0 = 0\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = sin(2x) at x = π/4 is 0."
