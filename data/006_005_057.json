    "message_1": "A company has found that 15% of its products are defective. If they produce 500 products in a day, what is the probability that at least 70 of these products are defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of products produced), k is the number of successes (defective products), p is the probability of success (0.15), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nHowever, since we want to find the probability of at least 70 defective products, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 70, 71, 72, ..., 500.\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 70 to 500\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be time-consuming, so we can use a complementary probability approach. We can find the probability of having 69 or fewer defective products and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of having at least 70 defective products.\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = 1 - P(X ≤ 69) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 69\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 69 using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X ≤ 69) = Σ (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k) for k = 0 to 69\n\nUsing a calculator or software that can handle binomial probabilities, we find that:\n\nP(X ≤ 69) ≈ 0.9824\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 70 defective products:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = 1 - P(X ≤ 69) = 1 - 0.9824 ≈ 0.0176\n\nSo, the probability that at least 70 of the 500 products produced in a day are defective is approximately 1.76%."
