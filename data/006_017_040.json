    "message_2": "To find the number of accidents involving only one car, we can multiply the total number of accidents by the percentage of accidents involving one car.\n\n500 accidents * 20% = 500 * 0.20 = 100 accidents\n\nSo, 100 accidents involved only one car on this stretch of road last year."
