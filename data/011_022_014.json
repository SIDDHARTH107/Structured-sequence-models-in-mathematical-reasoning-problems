    "message_1": "A student is going for a hike and can only carry a maximum weight of 8 kgs in their backpack. There are 5 items they want to bring on their hike: a water bottle (weighs 0.7 kg), a tent (weighs 1.5 kg), a sleeping bag (weighs 1.2 kg), a pair of hiking boots (weighs 1.8 kg), and a first aid kit (weighs 0.5 kg). Using the 0/1 Knapsack problem, can the student bring all 5 items in their backpack without exceeding the maximum weight limit? If the answer is yes, what is the maximum weight they can add to their backpack while still being able to carry all 5 items?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the student can carry all 5 items without exceeding the maximum weight limit, we need to calculate the total weight of all items.\n\nTotal weight = weight of water bottle + weight of tent + weight of sleeping bag + weight of hiking boots + weight of first aid kit\nTotal weight = 0.7 kg + 1.5 kg + 1.2 kg + 1.8 kg + 0.5 kg\nTotal weight = 5.7 kg\n\nSince the total weight of all items (5.7 kg) is less than the maximum weight limit of 8 kg, the student can carry all 5 items in their backpack.\n\nThe maximum weight they can add to their backpack while still being able to carry all 5 items is the difference between the maximum weight limit and the total weight of all items.\n\nMaximum additional weight = maximum weight limit - total weight of all items\nMaximum additional weight = 8 kg - 5.7 kg\nMaximum additional weight = 2.3 kg"
