    "message_1": "Alice has 10 identical chocolates to give away to her 4 friends. In how many ways can she distribute the chocolates such that each friend receives at least one chocolate?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. Since each friend must receive at least one chocolate, we can first give one chocolate to each friend. Now, Alice has 6 chocolates left to distribute among her 4 friends.\n\nWe can represent the chocolates as stars (*) and use bars (|) to separate the chocolates given to each friend. For example, if Alice gives 3 chocolates to the first friend, 1 to the second, 1 to the third, and 1 to the fourth, we can represent this as:\n\n***|*|*|*\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the 6 remaining chocolates (stars) and the 3 bars. There are a total of 9 positions (6 stars and 3 bars), and we need to choose 3 of those positions for the bars.\n\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 9 and k = 3.\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!)\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!6!)\nC(9, 3) = 362880 / (6 * 720)\nC(9, 3) = 362880 / 4320\nC(9, 3) = 84\n\nSo, there are 84 ways for Alice to distribute the remaining 6 chocolates among her 4 friends, ensuring that each friend receives at least one chocolate."
