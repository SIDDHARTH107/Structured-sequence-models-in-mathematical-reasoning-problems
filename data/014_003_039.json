    "message_1": "Suppose we have a public key for ElGamal encryption as (p=17, g=7, h=10), where p is a prime number, g is a primitive root of p, and h is computed as g^a mod p for some secret key a. The plaintext message m=11 is to be encrypted using this public key. \n\nWhat is the resulting ciphertext (c1, c2) after encryption and how to decrypt it?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message m=11 using the ElGamal public key (p=17, g=7, h=10), we first need to choose a random integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ p-2). Let's choose k=5 for this example.\n\nNow, we compute the ciphertext (c1, c2) as follows:\n\nc1 = g^k mod p = 7^5 mod 17 = 16,843 mod 17 = 3\nc2 = m * (h^k mod p) = 11 * (10^5 mod 17) = 11 * (100,000 mod 17) = 11 * 15 = 165\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is (c1, c2) = (3, 165).\n\nTo decrypt the ciphertext, we need to find the secret key a. Since we don't have it, we'll have to use the given information to compute it. We know that h = g^a mod p, so:\n\n10 = 7^a mod 17\n\nBy trying different values of a, we find that a=5 satisfies the equation:\n\n10 = 7^5 mod 17 = 16,843 mod 17 = 10\n\nNow, we can decrypt the ciphertext (c1, c2) = (3, 165) using the secret key a=5:\n\nm = c2 * (c1^a)^(-1) mod p = 165 * (3^5)^(-1) mod 17 = 165 * 2,187^(-1) mod 17\n\nTo find the modular inverse of 2,187 mod 17, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or try different values. We find that the modular inverse of 2,187 mod 17 is 8:\n\n2,187 * 8 mod 17 = 17,496 mod 17 = 1\n\nNow, we can compute the plaintext message m:\n\nm = 165 * 8 mod 17 = 1,320 mod 17 = 11\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext message is m = 11."
