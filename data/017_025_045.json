    "message_2": "To find the total number of non-abelian groups of order 120, we first need to analyze the prime factorization of 120. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is based on the Sylow theorems:\n\nn_p = number of Sylow p-subgroups\nn_p | G, where G is the order of the group\nn_p ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nFor a group of order 120, we have the following Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups (p = 2): n_2 | 120 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups (p = 3): n_3 | 120 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups (p = 5): n_5 | 120 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we will find the possible values of n_p for each prime factor:\n\n1. n_2: Possible values are 1, 3, 5, 15, and 30.\n2. n_3: Possible values are 1, 4, and 10.\n3. n_5: Possible values are 1 and 6.\n\nWe can now analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and their corresponding non-abelian groups:\n\n1. n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: This combination corresponds to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, which we are asked to exclude.\n2. n_2 = 5, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1: This combination corresponds to the non-abelian group (C2 × C2 × C2) ⋊ (C3 × C5), which is not isomorphic to C120 or A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 non-abelian group of order 120, excluding the cyclic group C120 and the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2."
