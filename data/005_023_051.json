    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n64, 66, 68, 70, 70, 72, 74, 76, 76, 78, 80, 82, 82, 84, 86, 88, 88, 90, 92, 94\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2), which is the average of the two middle numbers:\n\n(78 + 80) / 2 = 79\n\nNow, we find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3). Since there are 20 data points, we can split the data into two equal parts of 10 each. The lower half is:\n\n64, 66, 68, 70, 70, 72, 74, 76, 76, 78\n\nThe upper half is:\n\n80, 82, 82, 84, 86, 88, 88, 90, 92, 94\n\nFind the median of the lower half (Q1):\n\n(70 + 72) / 2 = 71\n\nFind the median of the upper half (Q3):\n\n(88 + 88) / 2 = 88\n\nNow, we calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 88 - 71 = 17\n\nNext, we find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 71 - 1.5 * 17 = 71 - 25.5 = 45.5\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 88 + 1.5 * 17 = 88 + 25.5 = 113.5\n\nNow, we check if there are any data points outside the lower and upper bounds:\n\nAll the data points are within the range of 45.5 to 113.5, so there are no outliers in the data set."
