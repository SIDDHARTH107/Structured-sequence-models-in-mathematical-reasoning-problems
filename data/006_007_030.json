    "message_1": "A stock is currently priced at $100 per share. The probability of the stock price increasing by $20 per share is 0.3, and the probability of the stock price decreasing by $30 per share is 0.2. What is the probability that the stock price will not change at all?",
    "message_2": "Let P(x) be the probability of the stock price changing by x dollars. We are given P(20) = 0.3 and P(-30) = 0.2. Since the probabilities of all possible outcomes must sum to 1, we can find the probability of the stock price not changing at all, P(0), as follows:\n\nP(20) + P(-30) + P(0) = 1\n\n0.3 + 0.2 + P(0) = 1\n\nP(0) = 1 - 0.3 - 0.2\n\nP(0) = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will not change at all is 0.5 or 50%."
