    "message_1": "Sorry, but a precise numerical problem cannot be formulated for the subject of Non-monotonic logic as it deals with reasoning under uncertainty and incomplete knowledge. However, here's a sample question related to the topic that a math student can contemplate on and attempt to solve:\n\nConsider a set of rules that describe the behavior of a system. In Non-monotonic logic, some rules may be retracted when new information appears, leading to a change in the system's behavior. If a new rule is added to the existing set of rules, how can one determine if it can be safely added without causing any undesired changes in the system's behavior?",
    "message_2": "To determine if a new rule can be safely added without causing undesired changes in the system's behavior, one can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the set of rules (R) that describe the current behavior of the system.\n2. Identify the new rule (N) that needs to be added.\n3. Determine the possible consequences (C) of adding the new rule N to the set of rules R.\n4. Analyze the consequences C to identify any undesired changes in the system's behavior. This can be done by comparing the system's behavior before and after the addition of the new rule.\n5. If the analysis shows that there are no undesired changes in the system's behavior, the new rule can be safely added. Otherwise, further investigation is needed to modify the new rule or adjust the existing rules to prevent undesired changes.\n\nNote that this process may not always result in a clear-cut answer, as non-monotonic logic deals with uncertainty and incomplete knowledge. In such cases, additional information or expert knowledge may be required to make a decision."
