    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is actually not concerned with numerical problems, but with norms and obligations. It is a branch of logic that deals with the concepts of permission, obligation, prohibition, and related concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical problem for the student to solve. Would you like me to provide a question related to deontic logic instead?",
    "message_2": "Certainly! Here's a question related to deontic logic:\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n1. If it is raining, you are obligated to bring an umbrella.\n2. It is raining.\n\nUsing deontic logic, determine whether you are obligated to bring an umbrella or not."
