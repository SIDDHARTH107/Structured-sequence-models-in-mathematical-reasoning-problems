    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping, we will perform a series of transformations to map the upper half-plane to the desired half-disk.\n\n1. First, we map the upper half-plane to the unit disk. We can accomplish this using the transformation $f_1(z) = \\frac{z - i}{z + i}$. This maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk, with the positive imaginary axis being mapped to the boundary of the unit disk.\n\n2. Next, we map the unit disk to itself such that the point $1$ on the boundary is mapped to the origin. We can accomplish this using the transformation $f_2(w) = w - 1$. This maps the unit disk to itself, with the point $1$ being mapped to the origin.\n\n3. Finally, we map the unit disk to the desired half-disk by taking the square root of the complex number. This can be done using the transformation $f_3(w) = \\sqrt{w}$. This maps the unit disk to the half-disk, with the positive real axis being mapped to the boundary of the half-disk.\n\nNow, we can find the overall conformal mapping by composing these transformations: $f(z) = f_3(f_2(f_1(z))) = \\sqrt{\\frac{z - i}{z + i} - 1}$.\n\nThus, the conformal mapping that maps the upper half-plane to the desired half-disk is given by $f(z) = \\sqrt{\\frac{z - i}{z + i} - 1}$."
