    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing the central square of a larger square and repeating the process on the remaining smaller squares. In each iteration, 1/3 of the remaining area is removed.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the area of the Sierpinski carpet is:\n81 * (8/9) = 72 square units\n\nAfter the second iteration, the area is:\n72 * (8/9) = 64 square units\n\nAfter the third iteration, the area is:\n64 * (8/9) = 64 * (64/81) = 512/9 square units\n\nAfter the fourth iteration, the area is:\n(512/9) * (8/9) = 4096/81 square units\n\nSo, the area of the Sierpinski carpet after the fourth iteration is 4096/81 square units."
