    "message_1": "Suppose the current stock price of XYZ corp is $100 and the probability of its stock price increase by 20% is 0.3 while the probability of its stock price decrease by 10% is 0.7. What is the probability the stock price of XYZ corp will be $90 after one trading day?",
    "message_2": "The problem states that there are two possible outcomes for the stock price of XYZ corp after one trading day: \n\n1. The stock price increases by 20% with a probability of 0.3.\n2. The stock price decreases by 10% with a probability of 0.7.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that the stock price will be $90 after one trading day. This corresponds to the stock price decreasing by 10%. \n\nSince the probability of the stock price decreasing by 10% is given as 0.7, the probability that the stock price of XYZ corp will be $90 after one trading day is 0.7."
