    "message_2": "To find the value of x that maximizes the integral I(x) = ∫[0,x] f(t) dt, we first need to find the integral of f(t) = sin(t) + cos(t) with respect to t.\n\n∫(sin(t) + cos(t)) dt = -cos(t) + sin(t) + C\n\nNow, we want to find I(x) = -cos(x) + sin(x) - (-cos(0) + sin(0)):\n\nI(x) = -cos(x) + sin(x) - (-1 + 0) = -cos(x) + sin(x) + 1\n\nTo find the maximum value of I(x) in the interval [0, pi/2], we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of I(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndI(x)/dx = d(-cos(x) + sin(x) + 1)/dx = sin(x) + cos(x)\n\nNow, set dI(x)/dx = 0:\n\nsin(x) + cos(x) = 0\n\nTo solve for x, we can use the trigonometric identity sin(x) = cos(pi/2 - x):\n\ncos(pi/2 - x) + cos(x) = 0\n\nUsing the angle addition formula for cosine, we get:\n\ncos(pi/2)cos(x) + sin(pi/2)sin(x) + cos(x) = 0\n\nSince cos(pi/2) = 0 and sin(pi/2) = 1, this simplifies to:\n\nsin(x) + cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, divide by √2:\n\n(sin(x) + cos(x))/√2 = 0\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity sin(x + pi/4) = (sin(x)cos(pi/4) + cos(x)sin(pi/4)) = (sin(x) + cos(x))/√2, we have:\n\nsin(x + pi/4) = 0\n\nTherefore, x + pi/4 = n*pi, where n is an integer. Since x is in the interval [0, pi/2], we have:\n\n0 + pi/4 = pi/4\n\nSo, x = pi/4. Now, we need to check if this value of x maximizes the integral I(x). Since the second derivative of I(x) is:\n\nd²I(x)/dx² = d(sin(x) + cos(x))/dx = cos(x) - sin(x)\n\nAt x = pi/4, the second derivative is:\n\ncos(pi/4) - sin(pi/4) = √2/2 - √2/2 = 0\n\nSince the second derivative is inconclusive, we can check the endpoints of the interval [0, pi/2]:\n\nI(0) = -cos(0) + sin(0) + 1 = 0\nI(pi/2) = -cos(pi/2) + sin(pi/2) + 1 = 1\nI(pi/4) = -cos(pi/4) + sin(pi/4) + 1 = (√2 - 1)/2 + 1\n\nSince I(pi/4) > I(0) and I(pi/4) > I(pi/2), the value of x that maximizes the integral I(x) in the interval [0, pi/2] is x = pi/4."
