He has narrowed down his options to two different laptops. Laptop A costs $850 and has a battery life of 6 hours. Laptop B costs $950 but has a battery life of 9 hours.\n\nUsing expected value theory, which laptop should the student buy in terms of maximizing the value of his purchase? Assume that the student values 1 hour of battery life at $75.",
    "message_2": "To determine which laptop the student should buy, we need to calculate the expected value of each laptop. The expected value is the value of the battery life minus the cost of the laptop.\n\nFor Laptop A:\nValue of battery life = 6 hours * $75/hour = $450\nExpected value = Value of battery life - Cost = $450 - $850 = -$400\n\nFor Laptop B:\nValue of battery life = 9 hours * $75/hour = $675\nExpected value = Value of battery life - Cost = $675 - $950 = -$275\n\nSince the student has a budget of $900, he cannot afford Laptop B. Therefore, the student should buy Laptop A, as it has a higher expected value within his budget."
