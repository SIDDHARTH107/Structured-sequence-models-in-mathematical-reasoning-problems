    "message_1": "Here's an example numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Moral Hazard in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose two partners, John and Lisa, are working together to start a company. John invests $10,000 and Lisa invests $5,000. If the company is successful, their profits will be split equally. However, if the company fails, John will lose all of his investment while Lisa will only lose half of hers due to having a backup job.\n\nAssume that the probability of success for the company is p, where p ranges from 0 to 1. John has two options: work hard with a probability of q (where q also ranges from 0 to 1) or shirk (not work hard) with a probability of 1-q.\n\nIf John works hard and the company is successful, he will earn a profit of $20,000. If John shirks and the company is successful, he will earn a profit of $15,000. However, if the company fails, John will earn $0 regardless of whether he works hard or shirks.\n\nIf Lisa finds out that John shirked, she will bail on the company and start another one with her backup job. Assume that Lisa knows that John might shirk, and that her probability of starting a successful backup company is (1-p).\n\nWhat value of q should John choose to maximize his expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the value of q that maximizes John's expected profit, we need to calculate his expected profit for both working hard and shirking, and then compare the two.\n\nExpected profit when John works hard (EWH):\nEWH = q * (p * $20,000 + (1-p) * $0)\n\nExpected profit when John shirks (ESH):\nESH = (1-q) * (p * $15,000 + (1-p) * $0)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of q that maximizes John's expected profit. To do this, we can set the derivative of the difference between EWH and ESH with respect to q equal to 0 and solve for q.\n\nd(EWH - ESH)/dq = d(q * p * $20,000 - (1-q) * p * $15,000)/dq\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nd(5,000 * p * q)/dq = 5,000 * p\n\nSince p is a constant, the derivative is equal to 5,000 * p. To maximize John's expected profit, the derivative should be equal to 0. However, since p is a constant and ranges from 0 to 1, the derivative can never be equal to 0.\n\nThis means that John's expected profit is always increasing with respect to q. Therefore, to maximize his expected profit, John should choose the highest possible value of q, which is q = 1. This means that John should always work hard to maximize his expected profit."
