    "message_1": "A machine fills bottles with soda, and the amount of soda in each bottle follows a normal distribution with a mean of 500mL and a standard deviation of 10mL. If a sample of 36 bottles is selected, what is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of soda in the bottles?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of soda in the bottles, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 500mL, and the standard deviation is 10mL. Since we have a sample of 36 bottles, the standard error can be calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size = 10 / √36 = 10 / 6 = 1.67mL\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the critical value (z-score) is 1.96. Now we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 500 ± (1.96 * 1.67)\n\nConfidence Interval = 500 ± 3.27\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean amount of soda in the bottles is (496.73 mL, 503.27 mL)."
