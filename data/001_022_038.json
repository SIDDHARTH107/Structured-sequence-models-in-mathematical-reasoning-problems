    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the exact roots can be challenging. However, we can approximate the x-intercepts by graphing the equation and observing where the curve intersects the x-axis.\n\nUpon graphing the equation, we can see that the curve intersects the x-axis at approximately:\n\nx ≈ -0.35\nx ≈ 0.5\nx ≈ 1.4\n\nThese are the approximate x-intercepts.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^3 - 3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1\ny = -1\n\nSo the y-intercept is at the point (0, -1)."
