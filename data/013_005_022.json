    "message_1": "In the game of Chicken, two cars are racing towards each other at 80 mph. If both drivers stay on course, there will be a crash. If one driver swerves and the other doesn't, the swerving driver is labeled \"chicken\" and loses the respect of their peers. The game ends in a draw if both drivers swerve. Each driver's payoff is determined by how \"brave\" they are. If both drivers stay on course, each gets a payoff of -100. If one driver swerves and the other doesn't, the swerving driver gets a payoff of -10 while the other gets a payoff of -200. If both drivers swerve, each receives a payoff of -50. \n\nAssuming both drivers are equally brave, what is the optimal strategy for each driver?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for each driver, we can analyze the possible outcomes and their respective payoffs using a payoff matrix. The matrix will look like this:\n\n```\n               Driver 2\n               Stay   Swerve\nDriver 1 Stay  (-100, -100) (-200, -10)\n        Swerve (-10, -200)  (-50, -50)\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze the payoffs for each driver:\n\nFor Driver 1:\n- If Driver 2 stays on course, Driver 1's payoffs are -100 (if they also stay) and -10 (if they swerve). In this case, Driver 1 should swerve.\n- If Driver 2 swerves, Driver 1's payoffs are -200 (if they stay) and -50 (if they swerve). In this case, Driver 1 should swerve.\n\nFor Driver 2:\n- If Driver 1 stays on course, Driver 2's payoffs are -100 (if they also stay) and -10 (if they swerve). In this case, Driver 2 should swerve.\n- If Driver 1 swerves, Driver 2's payoffs are -200 (if they stay) and -50 (if they swerve). In this case, Driver 2 should swerve.\n\nBased on this analysis, the optimal strategy for both drivers is to swerve. This results in a payoff of -50 for each driver, which is better than the other possible outcomes."
