    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate y from the first two equations. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n4x + 2y - 6z = 10\n3x - 2y + 4z = 8\n\nNow, add the two equations to eliminate y:\n\n7x - 2z = 18 (Equation 1)\n\nNext, we will eliminate y from the second and third equations. Multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n9x - 6y + 12z = 24\n10x + 6y - 14z = 26\n\nNow, add the two equations to eliminate y:\n\n19x - 2z = 50 (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n7x - 2z = 18\n19x - 2z = 50\n\nTo eliminate z, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n12x = 32\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 32 / 12\nx = 8 / 3\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find the value of z:\n\n7(8/3) - 2z = 18\n\n56/3 - 2z = 18\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\n2z = 56/3 - 54/3\n2z = 2/3\n\nz = 1/3\n\nNow that we have the values of x and z, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. We will use the first equation:\n\n2(8/3) + y - 3(1/3) = 5\n\n16/3 + y - 1 = 5\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = 5 - 16/3 + 1\ny = 8/3\n\nSo the values of x, y, and z are:\n\nx = 8/3\ny = 8/3\nz = 1/3"
