    "message_1": "A student needs to find the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a surface with the following characteristics:\n- The surface is a sphere with radius 2 units.\n- The surface is oriented counterclockwise.\n- The surface has a constant curvature of 1 unit.\n\nWhat is the total Gaussian curvature of the surface using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact, oriented surface S with boundary ∂S, the total Gaussian curvature K integrated over the surface S is related to the Euler characteristic χ(S) and the geodesic curvature k_g integrated over the boundary ∂S:\n\n∫∫_S K dA + ∫_∂S k_g ds = 2πχ(S)\n\nFor a sphere, the Euler characteristic χ(S) is 2, and since it is a closed surface with no boundary, the geodesic curvature term ∫_∂S k_g ds is 0. The constant curvature of the sphere is given as 1 unit. Let's denote the total area of the sphere as A. Then, we can rewrite the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for the sphere as:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nSince the curvature K is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nK * ∫∫_S dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nNow, we need to find the total area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere with radius r is:\n\nA = 4πr^2\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 2 units, we can find the total area:\n\nA = 4π(2^2) = 16π\n\nNow, we can substitute the area A and the curvature K back into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\nK * A = 2πχ(S)\n1 * 16π = 2π(2)\n\n16π = 4π\n\nThis equation holds true, which means the total Gaussian curvature of the surface using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is 16π."
