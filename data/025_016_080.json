    "message_2": "Let $u = \\frac{x}{1-y}$ and $v = \\frac{y}{1-x}$. We want to find the equation of the image of $C$ under the map $\\varphi$. To do this, we first need to express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$. From the definition of $\\varphi$, we have:\n\n$x = u(1-y)$ and $y = v(1-x)$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$. From the first equation, we have $x = u - uy$. Substituting the second equation into this, we get:\n\n$x = u - u(v(1-x))$.\n\nNow, solve for $x$:\n\n$x(1 + uv) = u \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{u}{1 + uv}$.\n\nSimilarly, we can solve for $y$:\n\n$y = v - vx \\Rightarrow y = v - v(\\frac{u}{1 + uv}) \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{v}{1 + uv}$.\n\nNow, substitute these expressions for $x$ and $y$ back into the equation of the curve $C: x^2 + y^2 = 1$:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{u}{1 + uv}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{v}{1 + uv}\\right)^2 = 1$.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$\\frac{u^2}{(1 + uv)^2} + \\frac{v^2}{(1 + uv)^2} = 1$.\n\nMultiply both sides by $(1 + uv)^2$ to get rid of the denominators:\n\n$u^2 + v^2 = (1 + uv)^2$.\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\n$u^2 + v^2 = 1 + 2uv + u^2v^2$.\n\nRearrange the equation to get the equation of the image of $C$ under the map $\\varphi$:\n\n$u^2v^2 - 2uv + v^2 + u^2 - 1 = 0$.\n\nSo, the equation of the image of $C$ under the rational map $\\varphi$ is:\n\n$u^2v^2 - 2uv + v^2 + u^2 - 1 = 0$."
