    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces two types of chairs: a basic chair and a deluxe chair. Each basic chair requires 3 hours of labor and yields a profit of $20. Each deluxe chair requires 5 hours of labor and yields a profit of $30. Given that the manufacturer has 120 hours of labor available and wants to make at least 15 chairs, what is the maximum profit that can be earned?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of basic chairs and y be the number of deluxe chairs.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 3x + 5y ≤ 120 (each basic chair requires 3 hours of labor and each deluxe chair requires 5 hours of labor, and there are 120 hours of labor available)\n2. Chair constraint: x + y ≥ 15 (the manufacturer wants to make at least 15 chairs)\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (the number of chairs cannot be negative)\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y (each basic chair yields a profit of $20 and each deluxe chair yields a profit of $30).\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies all the constraints. We can rewrite the labor constraint as y ≤ (120 - 3x) / 5 and the chair constraint as y ≥ 15 - x.\n\nNow, we can graph the inequalities and find the feasible region:\n\n1. y ≤ (120 - 3x) / 5\n2. y ≥ 15 - x\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 15), (15, 0), (20, 0), and (24, 4).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 15) = 20(0) + 30(15) = $450\n2. P(15, 0) = 20(15) + 30(0) = $300\n3. P(20, 0) = 20(20) + 30(0) = $400\n4. P(24, 4) = 20(24) + 30(4) = $720\n\nThe maximum profit is $720, which occurs when the manufacturer produces 24 basic chairs and 4 deluxe chairs."
