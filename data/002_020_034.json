    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to add the arc length and the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the arc length. The formula for the arc length (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, θ = 60 degrees and r = 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2 × 3.14159 × 5\nL = (1/6) × 31.4159\nL ≈ 5.236\n\nNow, we add the two radii (each 5 cm) to the arc length:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter ≈ 5.236 + 2 × 5\nPerimeter ≈ 5.236 + 10\nPerimeter ≈ 15.24 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 15.24 cm, rounded to two decimal places."
