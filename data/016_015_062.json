    "message_2": "The length of the Hilbert curve increases with each iteration. In general, the length of the nth iteration of the Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * (initial square length) / 2^(n-1)\n\nIn this case, the initial square length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length of the 5th iteration, so n = 5.\n\nLength = (2^5 - 1) * (1) / 2^(5-1)\nLength = (32 - 1) * (1) / 2^4\nLength = 31 / 16\n\nSo, the length of the 5th iteration of the Hilbert curve with an initial square length of 1 unit is 31/16 units."
