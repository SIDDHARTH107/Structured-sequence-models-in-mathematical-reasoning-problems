    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two standard six-sided dice, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a sum of 7) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any combination of numbers on two dice).\n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a sum of 7):\n\n1. Die 1 rolls a 1, and Die 2 rolls a 6 (1+6=7)\n2. Die 1 rolls a 2, and Die 2 rolls a 5 (2+5=7)\n3. Die 1 rolls a 3, and Die 2 rolls a 4 (3+4=7)\n4. Die 1 rolls a 4, and Die 2 rolls a 3 (4+3=7)\n5. Die 1 rolls a 5, and Die 2 rolls a 2 (5+2=7)\n6. Die 1 rolls a 6, and Die 2 rolls a 1 (6+1=7)\n\nThere are 6 favorable outcomes.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 6 / 36\nProbability = 1 / 6\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two standard six-sided dice is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667 (rounded to four decimal places)."
