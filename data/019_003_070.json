    "message_2": "To write down the truth table for the formula ◊(p ∧ q) ∨ ◊(q ∧ r), we need to consider all possible combinations of truth values for p, q, and r. There are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. The truth table will look like this:\n\np | q | r | p ∧ q | q ∧ r | ◊(p ∧ q) | ◊(q ∧ r) | ◊(p ∧ q) ∨ ◊(q ∧ r)\n--|---|---|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------------------\nT | T | T |   T   |   T   |    T    |    T    |          T\nT | T | F |   T   |   F   |    T    |    F    |          T\nT | F | T |   F   |   F   |    F    |    F    |          F\nT | F | F |   F   |   F   |    F    |    F    |          F\nF | T | T |   F   |   T   |    F    |    T    |          T\nF | T | F |   F   |   F   |    F    |    F    |          F\nF | F | T |   F   |   F   |    F    |    F    |          F\nF | F | F |   F   |   F   |    F    |    F    |          F\n\nNow, we can determine the possible worlds in which the formula ◊(p ∧ q) ∨ ◊(q ∧ r) is true. These are the worlds where the last column of the truth table is true (T):\n\n1. p = T, q = T, r = T\n2. p = T, q = T, r = F\n3. p = F, q = T, r = T\n\nSo, the possible worlds in which the formula ◊(p ∧ q) ∨ ◊(q ∧ r) is true are the ones where either both p and q are true, or both q and r are true."
