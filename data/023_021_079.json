Using the Fourier transforms, determine the maximum amplitude of the electromagnetic field generated by the wire at a distance of 4 meters.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amplitude of the electromagnetic field generated by the wire at a distance of 4 meters, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which relates the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire to the current and the distance from the wire.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field B at a point P due to a small segment of wire carrying current I is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), dl is the length of the small segment of wire, and r is the vector from the wire segment to the point P.\n\nSince the wire is straight and carries a sinusoidal current, we can write the current as:\n\nI(t) = I₀ * sin(2πft)\n\nwhere I₀ is the maximum current amplitude (2 A) and f is the frequency (50 Hz).\n\nNow, we need to integrate the Biot-Savart law over the entire length of the wire to find the total magnetic field at point P. The integration will be performed in the Fourier domain to account for the sinusoidal current.\n\nLet's denote the Fourier transform of the magnetic field as B(ω), where ω = 2πf is the angular frequency. The Fourier transform of the Biot-Savart law is:\n\ndB(ω) = (μ₀ * I(ω) * dl × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nIntegrating over the length of the wire, we get:\n\nB(ω) = ∫(μ₀ * I(ω) * dl × r) / (4 * π * r^3)\n\nSince the wire is straight, we can simplify the integral:\n\nB(ω) = (μ₀ * I(ω) * L) / (4 * π * r^2)\n\nwhere L is the length of the wire (2 meters).\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum amplitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 meters. To do this, we can take the inverse Fourier transform of B(ω) and evaluate it at r = 4 meters:\n\nB(t) = F^(-1)[B(ω)](r=4m)\n\nB(t) = (μ₀ * I(t) * L) / (4 * π * (4m)^2)\n\nB(t) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2 A * sin(2π * 50 Hz * t) * 2 m) / (4 * π * (4 m)^2)\n\nB(t) = (1.6 × 10^(-6) T * sin(100πt)) / 16π\n\nThe maximum amplitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 4 meters is the maximum value of B(t):\n\nB_max = 1.6 × 10^(-6) T / 16π ≈ 3.18 × 10^(-8) T"
