    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit made from one unit of product A is $10 and from one unit of product B is $12. The company has a maximum of 100 units of raw material available to produce both products. To produce one unit of product A, 3 units of raw material are required, and to produce one unit of product B, 4 units of raw material are required. Use global optimization techniques to determine the number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 4y <= 100 (raw material constraint)\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 4y <= 100\ny <= (100 - 3x) / 4\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative, the feasible region lies in the first quadrant. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect. We can find these points by solving the equations:\n\n1. Intersection of y-axis and the constraint line:\nx = 0\ny = (100 - 3x) / 4\ny = (100 - 3(0)) / 4\ny = 100 / 4\ny = 25\nPoint: (0, 25)\n\n2. Intersection of x-axis and the constraint line:\ny = 0\nx = (100 - 4y) / 3\nx = (100 - 4(0)) / 3\nx = 100 / 3\nx â‰ˆ 33.33\nSince the number of units must be an integer, we'll consider the closest integer values: 33 and 34.\nPoints: (33, 0) and (34, 0)\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these points:\n\nP(0, 25) = 10(0) + 12(25) = 0 + 300 = $300\nP(33, 0) = 10(33) + 12(0) = 330 + 0 = $330\nP(34, 0) = 10(34) + 12(0) = 340 + 0 = $340\n\nThe maximum profit is $340, which occurs when the company produces 34 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
