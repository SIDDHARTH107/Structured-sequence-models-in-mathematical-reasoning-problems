    "message_2": "To find the probability of a tornado occurring in the next 10 years, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, tornadoes) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events (in this case, tornadoes per year)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next 10 years, we can find the probability of no tornadoes occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nGiven that there are on average 2 tornadoes per year, in 10 years, the average rate (λ) would be 2 * 10 = 20 tornadoes.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of no tornadoes (k = 0) occurring in the next 10 years:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-20) * 20^0) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-20) * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) = e^(-20)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next 10 years:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - e^(-20)\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 2.06 * 10^(-9)\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 0.99999999794\n\nSo, the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next 10 years is approximately 99.999999794%."
