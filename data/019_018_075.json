    "message_2": "To prove that the formula [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] → (p → r) is a tautology using natural deduction, we will assume the antecedent [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] and show that the consequent (p → r) follows. Here's the proof:\n\n1. (p → q) ∧ (q → r) (Assumption)\n2. p → q (1, ∧-Elimination)\n3. q → r (1, ∧-Elimination)\n4. p (Assumption)\n5. q (2, 4, →-Elimination)\n6. r (3, 5, →-Elimination)\n7. p → r (4-6, →-Introduction)\n8. [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] → (p → r) (1-7, →-Introduction)\n\nThus, the formula [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] → (p → r) is a tautology, as we have shown that assuming the antecedent leads to the consequent using natural deduction rules."
