    "message_1": "A student wants to buy a new laptop for their studies. They are choosing between two options: an Apple MacBook Pro which costs $2000 but is highly reliable, or a Windows laptop that costs $1000 but has a higher chance of breaking. They estimate that if the MacBook Pro lasts at least 5 years, it will be worth the cost, whereas if the Windows laptop lasts at least 2 years, it will be worth the cost. If the student values their time at $25/hour and estimates that they will spend 2 hours per year dealing with computer issues on the Windows laptop, what is the expected value of each option? Which option should the student choose?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of each option, we need to consider the cost of the laptop, the value of the student's time spent on computer issues, and the expected lifespan of each laptop.\n\nFor the MacBook Pro:\nCost: $2000\nTime spent on computer issues: 0 hours (assuming no issues)\nExpected lifespan: 5 years (minimum)\n\nExpected value of MacBook Pro = Cost + (Time spent on computer issues * Value of student's time)\n= $2000 + (0 hours * $25/hour)\n= $2000\n\nFor the Windows laptop:\nCost: $1000\nTime spent on computer issues: 2 hours per year\nExpected lifespan: 2 years (minimum)\n\nExpected value of Windows laptop = Cost + (Time spent on computer issues * Value of student's time * Expected lifespan)\n= $1000 + (2 hours/year * $25/hour * 2 years)\n= $1000 + ($50/year * 2 years)\n= $1000 + $100\n= $1100\n\nBased on the expected value calculations, the MacBook Pro has an expected value of $2000, while the Windows laptop has an expected value of $1100. Since the student considers each laptop worth its cost if it lasts the expected lifespan, and the MacBook Pro has a higher expected value, the student should choose the MacBook Pro."
