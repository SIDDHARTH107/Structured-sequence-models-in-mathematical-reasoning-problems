    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The profit for product A is $5 per unit and for product B is $10 per unit. However, the production process for product B is more complex and requires more resources. Therefore, the factory can produce a maximum of 50 units of product B in a day, while product A can be produced up to 100 units a day. The factory has 300 units of resources available for production each day.\n\nThe factory wants to determine the optimal daily production plan to maximize their profit.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product that the factory should produce every day to ensure maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced daily.\n\nThe profit function is given by P(x, y) = 5x + 10y.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. x ≤ 100 (maximum units of product A)\n2. y ≤ 50 (maximum units of product B)\n3. x + 2y ≤ 300 (resource constraint)\n\nWe need to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit function P(x, y) subject to these constraints.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x = 100 is a vertical line at x = 100.\n2. y = 50 is a horizontal line at y = 50.\n3. x + 2y = 300 is a line with slope -1/2 and y-intercept 150. The feasible region is below this line.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (100, 0), (100, 50), and (0, 150). Since the profit function P(x, y) is linear, the maximum profit will occur at one of these vertices.\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 10(0) = $0\n2. P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 10(0) = $500\n3. P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 10(50) = $1000\n4. P(0, 150) = 5(0) + 10(150) = $1500 (not feasible since y > 50)\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (100, 50), with a profit of $1000. However, since the maximum units of product B is 50, we need to check the intersection of the resource constraint line (x + 2y = 300) with y = 50:\n\nx + 2(50) = 300\nx = 200 - 100\nx = 100\n\nSo, the optimal production plan is to produce 100 units of product A and 50 units of product B daily, resulting in a maximum profit of $1000."
