    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the solution to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) and then calculate the probability that X(t) exceeds 4 at time t = 2.\n\nThe given SDE is:\n\ndX(t) = aX(t)dt + bX(t)dW(t)\n\nwhere a = 1, b = 2, and X(0) = 2.\n\nThis is a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) with drift parameter a and volatility parameter b. The solution to this SDE is given by:\n\nX(t) = X(0) * exp((a - 0.5 * b^2) * t + b * W(t))\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that X(t) exceeds 4 at time t = 2. To do this, we will use the properties of the Wiener process and the fact that the logarithm of a GBM is normally distributed.\n\nLet Y(t) = ln(X(t)). Then, Y(t) is normally distributed with mean (a - 0.5 * b^2) * t and variance b^2 * t. In our case, a = 1, b = 2, and t = 2, so the mean and variance of Y(t) are:\n\nMean = (1 - 0.5 * 2^2) * 2 = -2\nVariance = 2^2 * 2 = 8\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that X(t) > 4, or equivalently, that Y(t) > ln(4). Since Y(t) is normally distributed, we can standardize it and use the standard normal distribution to find the probability:\n\nZ = (Y(t) - Mean) / sqrt(Variance) = (ln(4) - (-2)) / sqrt(8)\n\nZ = (1.386 - 2) / 2.828 = -0.217\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution to find the probability that Z > -0.217:\n\nP(Z > -0.217) = 1 - P(Z < -0.217) = 1 - 0.414 = 0.586\n\nTherefore, the probability that X(t) exceeds 4 at time t = 2 is approximately 0.586."
