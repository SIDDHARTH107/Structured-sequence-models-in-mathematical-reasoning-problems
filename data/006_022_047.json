    "message_1": "In a certain school, there are 200 students. The probability of a student graduating with honors is 0.4, while the probability of a student graduating without honors is 0.6. What is the expected number of students who will graduate with honors in the school?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of students who will graduate with honors, we can multiply the total number of students by the probability of a student graduating with honors.\n\nExpected number of students with honors = Total students * Probability of graduating with honors\n\nExpected number of students with honors = 200 * 0.4\n\nExpected number of students with honors = 80\n\nSo, the expected number of students who will graduate with honors in the school is 80."
