    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the initial temperature distribution $u(x,0)$. Since the given boundary conditions are homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions (i.e., $u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0$), we can use the sine Fourier series. The general form of the sine Fourier series is:\n\n$$u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nWe need to find the coefficients $B_n$ for the given initial temperature distribution $u(x,0)=4\\sin(2\\pi x)+2\\cos(4\\pi x)$. We can rewrite the given function as:\n\n$$u(x,0) = 4\\sin(2\\pi x) + 2\\sin(4\\pi x - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$$\n\nComparing this with the general form of the sine Fourier series, we can see that $B_2 = 4$ and $B_4 = 2$. All other coefficients are zero.\n\nNow, we can write the solution to the heat equation as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(n\\pi x) e^{-k(n\\pi)^2t}$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $B_2$ and $B_4$ and $k=2$, we get:\n\n$$u(x,t) = 4\\sin(2\\pi x)e^{-(2)(2\\pi)^2t} + 2\\sin(4\\pi x)e^{-(2)(4\\pi)^2t}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$ at time $t=1$:\n\n$$u(x,1) = 4\\sin(2\\pi x)e^{-(2)(2\\pi)^2} + 2\\sin(4\\pi x)e^{-(2)(4\\pi)^2}$$"
