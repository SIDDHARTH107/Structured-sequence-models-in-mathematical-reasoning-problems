    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (defective gadgets) in n trials (total gadgets)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as \"n choose k\"\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of gadgets in the batch)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of defective gadgets)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a gadget being defective)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 100 (total gadgets in the batch)\n- k = 5 (number of defective gadgets)\n- p = 0.05 (probability of a gadget being defective)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k), which is the number of combinations of 100 items taken 5 at a time:\n\nC(100, 5) = 100! / (5! * (100-5)!)\nC(100, 5) = 100! / (5! * 95!)\n\nNow, let's calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):\n\np^k = 0.05^5\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.05)^(100-5) = 0.95^95\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(100, 5) * 0.05^5 * 0.95^95\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nP(X = 5) â‰ˆ 0.1800\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 5 gadgets will exhibit the defect in a batch of 100 gadgets is approximately 0.1800 or 18%."
