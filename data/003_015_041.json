    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the function f(x) = 5sin(2x - π/4), we need to analyze the coefficients and the argument of the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is A*sin(B(x - C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the coefficient of x, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 5sin(2x - π/4), we can see that:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 5\nCoefficient of x (B) = 2\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of A, which is |5| = 5.\n\nTo find the period, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |B|\n\nIn our case, B = 2, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |2| = 2π / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 5sin(2x - π/4) is 5, and the period is π."
