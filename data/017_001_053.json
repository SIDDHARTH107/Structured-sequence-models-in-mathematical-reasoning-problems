It has one element of order 1 (the identity element).\n2. It has three elements of order 2.\n\nEvery group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, as these are the only two possible group structures for a group of order 4. If a group of order 4 has an element of order 4, it is isomorphic to C4. If all non-identity elements have order 2, it is isomorphic to V4."
