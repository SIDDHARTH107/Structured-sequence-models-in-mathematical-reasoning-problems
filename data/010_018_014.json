    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Morse-Smale complex with five critical points: two local maxima and three local minima. If the index of the north pole is 3, the index of the south pole is 0, and the index of the remaining critical points are 1, 2, and 2 respectively, what is the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex?",
    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a Morse-Smale complex can be computed using the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index. In this case, we have:\n\n- 2 local maxima with index 3\n- 2 critical points with index 2\n- 1 critical point with index 1\n- 3 local minima with index 0\n\nThe Euler characteristic χ is given by:\n\nχ = (# of index 0) - (# of index 1) + (# of index 2) - (# of index 3)\n\nχ = 3 - 1 + 2 - 2\n\nχ = 2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex is 2."
