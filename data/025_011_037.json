    "message_2": "To find the number of ways of embedding the elliptic curve E: $y^2 = x^3 + x$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we first homogenize the equation to obtain a projective curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. We introduce a new variable $z$ and multiply each term by the appropriate power of $z$ to make all terms homogeneous of the same degree. In this case, the degree is 3. So, we get the equation:\n\n$Y^2Z = X^3 + XZ^2$.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of non-isomorphic projective algebraic curves that contain E as a closed subscheme. In other words, we want to find the number of distinct curves in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ that have E as a subset.\n\nSince E is an elliptic curve, it is a smooth curve of genus 1. In $\\mathbb{P}^2$, a smooth curve of genus 1 is unique up to projective equivalence. This means that any other curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ containing E as a closed subscheme must be a singular curve that contains E.\n\nLet's consider the possible singular curves in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ that can contain E. The singular curves can be obtained by adding a multiple of a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 to the equation of E. Let $F(X, Y, Z) = Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2$, and let $G(X, Y, Z)$ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3. Then, the singular curves containing E are given by the equation:\n\n$F(X, Y, Z) + \\lambda G(X, Y, Z) = 0$,\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a scalar.\n\nHowever, since E is a smooth curve, the only way for a singular curve to contain E is if the singular curve is a double cover of E. This means that the singular curve must be of the form:\n\n$F(X, Y, Z) + \\lambda G(X, Y, Z) = (Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2)^2$.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of distinct curves of this form. Since the equation is homogeneous, we can consider the projective space of homogeneous polynomials of degree 6 in the variables X, Y, and Z. This projective space has dimension 9 (corresponding to the 9 coefficients of a general homogeneous polynomial of degree 6). The space of curves of the form $(Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2)^2$ is a linear subspace of this projective space, and it has dimension 1 (corresponding to the scalar $\\lambda$).\n\nTherefore, the number of non-isomorphic projective algebraic curves that contain E as a closed subscheme is the number of points in the projective space of dimension 9 minus the dimension of the linear subspace of curves of the form $(Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2)^2$, which is:\n\n$9 - 1 = 8$.\n\nSo, there are 8 non-isomorphic projective algebraic curves that contain E as a closed subscheme."
