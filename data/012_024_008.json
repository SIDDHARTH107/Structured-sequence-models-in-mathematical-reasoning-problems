    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we first need to find the number of faces (F). We can use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that V - E + F = 2. In this case, we have V = 10 and E = 20, so we can solve for F:\n\n10 - 20 + F = 2\nF = 12\n\nNow we can use the formula for the genus G:\n\nG = (E - V + F) / 2\nG = (20 - 10 + 12) / 2\nG = (22) / 2\nG = 11\n\nThe genus of the graph G is 11."
