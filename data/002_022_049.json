    "message_1": "What is the volume of a torus with a major radius of 8 cm and a minor radius of 4 cm?",
    "message_2": "The volume V of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 8 cm and r = 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 8 * 4^2\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 8 * 16\n\nV = 32 * π^2 * 16\n\nV ≈ 1017.876 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 1017.876 cubic centimeters."
