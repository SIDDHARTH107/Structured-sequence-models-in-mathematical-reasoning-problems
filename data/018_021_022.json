Finally, use the distributive property to show that the symmetric difference of set A and set B is distributive over the intersection of set A and set B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of set A and set B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nSymmetric difference (A Δ B) = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of set A and set B. The intersection is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection (A ∩ B) = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference is distributive over the intersection of set A and set B. The distributive property states that for any sets A, B, and C:\n\nA Δ (B ∩ C) = (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C)\n\nLet's consider another set C and find its symmetric difference and intersection with set A.\n\nC = {3, 4, 5}\n\nSymmetric difference (A Δ C) = {1, 2, 5}\nIntersection (A ∩ C) = {3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference and intersection of sets B and C.\n\nSymmetric difference (B Δ C) = {2, 5}\nIntersection (B ∩ C) = {3, 4}\n\nNow, we will find the left side of the distributive property equation:\n\nA Δ (B ∩ C) = A Δ {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, we will find the right side of the distributive property equation:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C) = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 5} = {1, 2, 5}\n\nSince the left side and the right side of the distributive property equation are equal, we have shown that the symmetric difference is distributive over the intersection of set A and set B:\n\nA Δ (B ∩ C) = (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C)"
