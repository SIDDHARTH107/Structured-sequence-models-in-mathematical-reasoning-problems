    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $2x + 5y = 23$, we can first find one particular solution and then use the general form of Diophantine equation solutions to find all other solutions.\n\nLet's find one particular solution by trial and error. We can start by setting $x = 0$ and solving for $y$:\n\n$2(0) + 5y = 23 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{23}{5}$\n\nSince $y$ is not an integer, we can try setting $x = 1$:\n\n$2(1) + 5y = 23 \\Rightarrow 5y = 21 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{21}{5}$\n\nAgain, $y$ is not an integer. Let's try $x = 2$:\n\n$2(2) + 5y = 23 \\Rightarrow 5y = 19 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{19}{5}$\n\nStill not an integer. Let's try $x = 3$:\n\n$2(3) + 5y = 23 \\Rightarrow 5y = 17 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{17}{5}$\n\nFinally, we have an integer value for $y$. So, one particular solution is $(x, y) = (3, \\frac{17}{5}) = (3, 3)$.\n\nNow, let's find the general form of the solutions. The general form of the solutions to the Diophantine equation $ax + by = c$ is given by:\n\n$(x, y) = (x_0 + \\frac{b}{\\gcd(a, b)}t, y_0 - \\frac{a}{\\gcd(a, b)}t)$\n\nwhere $(x_0, y_0)$ is a particular solution, $\\gcd(a, b)$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$, and $t$ is an integer.\n\nIn our case, $a = 2$, $b = 5$, $c = 23$, and $(x_0, y_0) = (3, 3)$. Since $\\gcd(2, 5) = 1$, the general form of the solutions is:\n\n$(x, y) = (3 + 5t, 3 - 2t)$\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for $t$:\n\n- For $t = 0$, we have $(x, y) = (3, 3)$, which is the particular solution we found earlier.\n- For $t = 1$, we have $(x, y) = (8, 1)$.\n- For $t = -1$, we have $(x, y) = (-2, 5)$.\n\nWe can continue plugging in different integer values for $t$ to find more solutions, but these are the only solutions with both $x$ and $y$ being non-negative integers. So, the integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $2x + 5y = 23$ are:\n\n$(x, y) = (3, 3), (8, 1), (-2, 5)$"
