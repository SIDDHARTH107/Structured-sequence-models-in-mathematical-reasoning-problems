    "message_2": "Let's call the smallest possible number N. According to the given conditions, we have the following equations:\n\n1. N ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n2. N ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n3. N ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences. The theorem states that if the moduli are pairwise coprime (which they are in this case), there exists a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli.\n\nFirst, let's find the product of the moduli: M = 3 × 5 × 7 = 105.\n\nNow, we'll find the partial products:\n\nM1 = M/3 = 105/3 = 35\nM2 = M/5 = 105/5 = 21\nM3 = M/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\n\n1. 35 × y1 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. 21 × y2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n3. 15 × y3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSolving these congruences, we get:\n\n1. y1 ≡ 2 (mod 3) since 35 × 2 = 70 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. y2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) since 21 × 1 = 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n3. y3 ≡ 1 (mod 7) since 15 × 1 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can find the solution N using the formula:\n\nN = (a1 × M1 × y1) + (a2 × M2 × y2) + (a3 × M3 × y3)\n\nwhere a1, a2, and a3 are the remainders from the original congruences (2, 3, and 2, respectively).\n\nN = (2 × 35 × 2) + (3 × 21 × 1) + (2 × 15 × 1)\nN = (140) + (63) + (30)\nN = 233\n\nHowever, we need to find the smallest positive solution, so we take the result modulo M:\n\nN ≡ 233 (mod 105)\n\nThus, the smallest possible number N is 233."
