    "message_2": "To compute the second de Rham cohomology group of $M$, we will use the fact that the de Rham cohomology groups of a smooth manifold are isomorphic to the singular cohomology groups with real coefficients. In particular, we have $H_{\\text{dR}}^2(M;\\mathbb{R}) \\cong H^2(M;\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nFor a surface of genus $g=2$, we know that it is a closed orientable surface, and its singular cohomology groups can be computed using the following formula:\n\n$H^k(M;\\mathbb{R}) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbb{R} & \\text{if } k=0, \\\\\n\\mathbb{R}^{2g} & \\text{if } k=1, \\\\\n\\mathbb{R} & \\text{if } k=2, \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}$\n\nIn our case, we are interested in the second cohomology group, so we have:\n\n$H_{\\text{dR}}^2(M;\\mathbb{R}) \\cong H^2(M;\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus, the second de Rham cohomology group of $M$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{R}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$."
