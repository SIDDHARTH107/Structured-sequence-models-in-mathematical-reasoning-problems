    "message_2": "There are two distinct groups of order 10. These groups are:\n\n1. The cyclic group C10: This group is generated by a single element of order 10 and has the elements {1, a, a^2, ..., a^9}, where a^10 = 1. It is an abelian group, meaning that its elements commute (i.e., ab = ba for all elements a and b in the group).\n\n2. The dihedral group D5: This group represents the symmetries of a regular pentagon and has 10 elements. It can be generated by two elements, r and s, with the relations r^5 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^4s. D5 is a non-abelian group, meaning that its elements do not commute in general (i.e., there exist elements a and b in the group such that ab â‰  ba).\n\nThere is no other non-abelian group of order 10. To see this, note that a group of order 10 must have an element of order 2 and an element of order 5, due to Lagrange's theorem. In a non-abelian group, these elements cannot commute. However, the only non-abelian group with these properties is D5.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two distinct groups of order 10: the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5. The non-abelian group of order 10 is isomorphic to D5."
