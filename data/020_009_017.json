On any given day, the demand for product A is a random variable with a normal distribution of mean 100 units and standard deviation 20 units, while the demand for product B is a random variable with a normal distribution of mean 120 units and standard deviation 15 units. The cost of product A is $5 per unit, while the cost of product B is $8 per unit. The store has a total budget of $1000 per day to purchase these products. The store wants to maximize its expected profit from selling these products.\n\nWhat is the optimal daily order quantity of products A and B?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal order quantity of products A and B that maximizes the expected profit, given the budget constraint of $1000 per day. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The budget constraint can be represented as:\n\n5x + 8y ≤ 1000\n\nThe expected profit function can be represented as:\n\nE[Profit] = E[Revenue] - E[Cost]\n\nThe revenue from selling product A is the price of product A times the demand for product A, and similarly for product B. Since we don't know the selling price of the products, let's assume the selling price of product A is p_A and the selling price of product B is p_B. Then the expected revenue can be represented as:\n\nE[Revenue] = p_A * E[Demand_A] + p_B * E[Demand_B]\n\nGiven the mean demand for product A is 100 units and product B is 120 units, the expected revenue is:\n\nE[Revenue] = p_A * 100 + p_B * 120\n\nThe expected cost is the cost of product A times the number of units of product A, plus the cost of product B times the number of units of product B:\n\nE[Cost] = 5x + 8y\n\nNow we can write the expected profit function as:\n\nE[Profit] = p_A * 100 + p_B * 120 - (5x + 8y)\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the budget constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this optimization problem. Define the Lagrangian function as:\n\nL(x, y, λ) = p_A * 100 + p_B * 120 - (5x + 8y) - λ(5x + 8y - 1000)\n\nNow we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = -5 + 5λ = 0\n∂L/∂y = -8 + 8λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 5x + 8y - 1000 = 0\n\nFrom the first two equations, we get:\n\nλ = 1\n\nSubstituting λ = 1 into the third equation:\n\n5x + 8y = 1000\n\nSince we know the demand for product A and product B follows a normal distribution, we can assume that the store will sell all the units it orders. Therefore, the optimal order quantity for products A and B will be the same as their mean demand values:\n\nx = 100\ny = 120\n\nSo the optimal daily order quantity of products A and B is 100 units and 120 units, respectively."
