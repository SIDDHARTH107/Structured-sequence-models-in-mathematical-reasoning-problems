    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of f(t) = te^(-2t^2), we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(t) e^(-jωt) dt\n\nHere, f(t) = te^(-2t^2) and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1). We want to compute the integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} te^(-2t^2) e^(-jωt) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let:\n\nu = t, dv = e^(-2t^2) e^(-jωt) dt\ndu = dt, v = ∫ e^(-2t^2) e^(-jωt) dt\n\nTo find v, we can use a substitution method. Let:\n\nx = √2t, dx = √2 dt\nt = x/√2, dt = dx/√2\n\nNow, we have:\n\nv = ∫ e^(-x^2) e^(-jω(x/√2)) (dx/√2)\nv = (1/√2) ∫ e^(-x^2) e^(-jω(x/√2)) dx\n\nThis integral is a Gaussian function multiplied by a complex exponential. Unfortunately, there is no elementary function for this integral. However, we can express it in terms of the error function with a complex argument (also known as the complex error function):\n\nv = (1/√2) * (1/2) * √(π/ω) * e^(ω^2/8) * erf((ω + 2jx)/2√2)\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts:\n\nF(ω) = uv|_{-∞}^{∞} - ∫_{-∞}^{∞} v du\nF(ω) = 0 - (1/2) * √(π/ω) * e^(ω^2/8) * ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-2t^2) e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThe remaining integral is the Fourier transform of e^(-2t^2), which is a known result:\n\n∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-2t^2) e^(-jωt) dt = (1/2) * √(π/2) * e^(-ω^2/8)\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into the expression for F(ω):\n\nF(ω) = - (1/2) * √(π/ω) * e^(ω^2/8) * (1/2) * √(π/2) * e^(-ω^2/8)\nF(ω) = - (1/4) * √(π^2/ω) * e^(0)\n\nFinally, we have the Fourier transform of f(t) = te^(-2t^2):\n\nF(ω) = - (1/4) * √(π^2/ω)"
