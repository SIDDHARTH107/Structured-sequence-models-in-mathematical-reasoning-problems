    "message_1": "The base of a trapezoid is 10 cm long and the height is 8 cm. Its shorter parallel side is 6 cm long. Find the area of the trapezoid.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are the base (10 cm) and the shorter parallel side (6 cm), and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 6) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (16) * 8\nArea = 8 * 8\nArea = 64 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 64 square centimeters."
