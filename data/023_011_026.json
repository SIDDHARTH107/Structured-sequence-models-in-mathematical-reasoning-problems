    "message_1": "A musical instrument produces a sound wave described by the equation f(t) = 5sin(10πt) + 3cos(20πt). Using the Fourier transform, what are the frequency components, amplitude, and phase angle of the sound wave?",
    "message_2": "The given function f(t) is already in the sum of sinusoids form, which is a sum of a sine and a cosine function. We can directly read off the frequency components, amplitude, and phase angle from the equation.\n\nThe equation is: f(t) = 5sin(10πt) + 3cos(20πt)\n\nFirst component:\nAmplitude: 5\nFrequency: (10π) / (2π) = 5 Hz\nSince it's a sine function, the phase angle is 0 degrees or 0 radians.\n\nSecond component:\nAmplitude: 3\nFrequency: (20π) / (2π) = 10 Hz\nSince it's a cosine function, the phase angle is 90 degrees or π/2 radians.\n\nSo, the frequency components are 5 Hz and 10 Hz, with amplitudes of 5 and 3, and phase angles of 0 and π/2 radians, respectively."
