Use the Poincaré map to find the period-2 orbit of the system.",
    "message_2": "To find the period-2 orbit of the logistic map, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the system returns to the same state after two iterations. In other words, we want to find the fixed points of the second iterate of the logistic map, which is given by:\n\n$$x_{n+2} = r(r x_n (1 - x_n))(1 - r x_n (1 - x_n))$$\n\nFor a period-2 orbit, we have $x_{n+2} = x_n$. Thus, we need to solve the following equation for $x_n$:\n\n$$x_n = r(r x_n (1 - x_n))(1 - r x_n (1 - x_n))$$\n\nSubstitute the given value of $r = 3.6$:\n\n$$x_n = 3.6(3.6 x_n (1 - x_n))(1 - 3.6 x_n (1 - x_n))$$\n\nLet $f(x) = 3.6x(1-x)$, so the equation becomes:\n\n$$x_n = f(f(x_n))$$\n\nNow, we need to find the fixed points of this equation. First, let's find the fixed points of $f(x)$:\n\n$$x = 3.6x(1-x)$$\n\nThis equation has two solutions: $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = \\frac{2}{3.6} = \\frac{1}{1.8}$.\n\nNext, we need to find the fixed points of $f(f(x))$. We already know that $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = \\frac{1}{1.8}$ are fixed points of $f(x)$, so we can plug them into $f(f(x))$ to see if they are also fixed points of the second iterate:\n\n1. For $x_1 = 0$, we have $f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0$, so $x_1 = 0$ is a fixed point of $f(f(x))$.\n\n2. For $x_2 = \\frac{1}{1.8}$, we have $f(f(\\frac{1}{1.8})) = f(\\frac{1}{1.8}) = \\frac{1}{1.8}$, so $x_2 = \\frac{1}{1.8}$ is a fixed point of $f(f(x))$.\n\nSince both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are fixed points of $f(f(x))$, they are part of the period-2 orbit of the logistic map for $r = 3.6$. Therefore, the period-2 orbit of the system is given by the points $x_n = 0$ and $x_n = \\frac{1}{1.8}$."
