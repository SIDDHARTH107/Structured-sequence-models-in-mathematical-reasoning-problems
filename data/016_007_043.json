    "message_1": "When constructing a Menger sponge, the original cube has an edge length of 3 cm. If the sponge is constructed to the 3rd iteration, how many smaller cubes are present in the final Menger sponge?",
    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole larger cube are removed, leaving 20 smaller cubes.\n\nIn the first iteration, we have 20 smaller cubes.\nIn the second iteration, each of the 20 smaller cubes will be divided into 27 even smaller cubes, and 7 of them will be removed, leaving 20 smaller cubes in each of the original 20 cubes. So, there will be 20 * 20 = 400 cubes.\nIn the third iteration, the same process is repeated for each of the 400 cubes, resulting in 20 * 400 = 8000 cubes.\n\nSo, in the final Menger sponge after the 3rd iteration, there are 8000 smaller cubes."
