    "message_1": "A beverage company claims that their soda cans contain an average of 355 ml of soda. A random sample of 25 cans is taken, and the sample mean is found to be 351 ml with a standard deviation of 10 ml. Test whether there is enough evidence to suggest that the true mean amount of soda in the cans is different from the company's claim at a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To test whether there is enough evidence to suggest that the true mean amount of soda in the cans is different from the company's claim at a 5% level of significance, we will perform a two-tailed t-test.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 355 ml (The true mean amount of soda is equal to the company's claim)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 355 ml (The true mean amount of soda is different from the company's claim)\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance (α).\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic (t-score).\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √n)\nt = (351 - 355) / (10 / √25)\nt = (-4) / 2\nt = -2\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical t-value.\nSince we are conducting a two-tailed t-test with a 5% level of significance and 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24), we can find the critical t-value using a t-distribution table or calculator. The critical t-value for a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and 24 degrees of freedom is approximately ±2.064.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical t-value.\nOur calculated t-score is -2, and the critical t-values are ±2.064.\n\nSince the t-score of -2 falls within the range of the critical t-values (±2.064), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is not enough evidence at a 5% level of significance to suggest that the true mean amount of soda in the cans is different from the company's claim of 355 ml."
