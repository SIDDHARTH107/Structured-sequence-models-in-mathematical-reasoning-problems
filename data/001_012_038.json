    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 24x^2 + 12x\nFactor out the common term 12x:\n12x(2x + 1)\n\nDenominator: 4x\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n(12x(2x + 1)) / (4x)\n\nNow, we can simplify by canceling out the common term x:\n(12(2x + 1)) / 4\n\nNext, we can simplify further by dividing 12 by 4:\n3(2x + 1)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n3(2x + 1)"
