    "message_1": "A group of 5 people are planning to attend a party. Each person can bring along as many friends as they'd like. How many ways are there for them to invite their friends if they want to invite at least 1 but no more than 4 additional friends each? (Hint: This problem can be solved using the Bell numbers formula).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of generating functions. Let's denote the number of friends each person can bring as x. Since each person can bring at least 1 and no more than 4 additional friends, we can represent this as a polynomial:\n\nP(x) = x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4\n\nNow, since there are 5 people, we need to find the coefficient of x^n in the expansion of P(x)^5, where n is the total number of friends invited.\n\nP(x)^5 = (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4)^5\n\nWe are interested in the coefficients of x^5, x^6, x^7, x^8, x^9, x^10, x^11, x^12, x^13, x^14, x^15, x^16, x^17, x^18, x^19, and x^20 in the expansion of P(x)^5, as these represent the number of ways to invite friends for each possible total number of friends invited.\n\nUsing the multinomial theorem, we can find the coefficients of these terms:\n\nCoefficient of x^5: C(5, 1, 0, 0, 0) = 5\nCoefficient of x^6: C(5, 0, 2, 0, 0) + C(5, 2, 1, 0, 0) = 10 + 60 = 70\nCoefficient of x^7: C(5, 0, 0, 3, 0) + C(5, 1, 1, 1, 0) = 10 + 120 = 130\nCoefficient of x^8: C(5, 0, 4, 0, 0) + C(5, 2, 0, 2, 0) + C(5, 3, 2, 0, 0) = 5 + 100 + 300 = 405\nCoefficient of x^9: C(5, 1, 0, 1, 1) + C(5, 0, 2, 1, 0) = 240 + 150 = 390\nCoefficient of x^10: C(5, 0, 0, 0, 2) + C(5, 2, 1, 0, 1) = 15 + 600 = 615\nCoefficient of x^11: C(5, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 720\nCoefficient of x^12: C(5, 0, 2, 0, 1) = 300\nCoefficient of x^13: C(5, 1, 0, 1, 2) = 600\nCoefficient of x^14: C(5, 0, 0, 2, 1) = 75\nCoefficient of x^15: C(5, 1, 1, 0, 2) = 300\nCoefficient of x^16: C(5, 0, 2, 1, 1) = 150\nCoefficient of x^17: C(5, 1, 0, 0, 3) = 20\nCoefficient of x^18: C(5, 0, 0, 1, 2) = 30\nCoefficient of x^19: C(5, 1, 1, 1, 0) = 120\nCoefficient of x^20: C(5, 0, 0, 0, 4) = 1\n\nNow, we sum up these coefficients to find the total number of ways to invite friends:\n\n5 + 70 + 130 + 405 + 390 + 615 + 720 + 300 + 600 + 75 + 300 + 150 + 20 + 30 + 120 + 1 = 3811\n\nSo, there are 3811 ways for the 5 people to invite their friends with the given constraints."
