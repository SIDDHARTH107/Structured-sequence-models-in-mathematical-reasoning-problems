    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) = sqrt(3)cos(x), we can start by dividing both sides by cos(x):\n\n2sin(x) / cos(x) = sqrt(3)\n\nNow, we can use the identity tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x):\n\n2tan(x) = sqrt(3)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\ntan(x) = sqrt(3) / 2\n\nNow, we can find the values of x in the given range (0 <= x <= 360 degrees) for which the tangent function equals sqrt(3) / 2. The tangent function has a period of 180 degrees, so we can find the first solution in the range 0 to 180 degrees and then add 180 degrees to find the second solution.\n\nThe first solution is:\n\nx = arctan(sqrt(3) / 2)\nx ≈ 60 degrees\n\nThe second solution is:\n\nx = 60 + 180\nx = 240 degrees\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x ≈ 60 degrees and x = 240 degrees."
