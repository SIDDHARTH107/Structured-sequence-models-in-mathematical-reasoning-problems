    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible for this to be the degree sequence of graph G. Here's a possible graph:\n\nLabel the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n\n1. Connect vertex A to vertices B, C, D, and E. (Degree of A is 4)\n2. Connect vertex B to vertex F. (Degree of B is 2)\n3. Connect vertex C to vertex G. (Degree of C is 2)\n4. Connect vertex D to vertex H. (Degree of D is 2)\n5. Vertices E, F, G, and H have a degree of 1.\n\nThe resulting graph has the desired degree sequence: 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1."
