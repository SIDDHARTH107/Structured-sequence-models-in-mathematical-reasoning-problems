    "message_1": "A circuit has a voltage input that can be expressed as a square wave with a frequency of 10 kHz. Using the Fourier transform, determine the frequency spectrum of the electromagnetic waves produced by this circuit.",
    "message_2": "A square wave can be represented as a sum of sine waves with odd harmonics using the Fourier series. The general formula for the Fourier series of a square wave with amplitude A and fundamental frequency f0 is:\n\nx(t) = A * Σ [ (1/n) * sin(2π * n * f0 * t) ] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nwhere n is the harmonic number, and the summation is over all odd integers.\n\nGiven the fundamental frequency of the square wave is 10 kHz, we can find the frequency spectrum of the electromagnetic waves produced by this circuit by calculating the frequencies of the odd harmonics:\n\nf1 = 1 * f0 = 1 * 10 kHz = 10 kHz\nf3 = 3 * f0 = 3 * 10 kHz = 30 kHz\nf5 = 5 * f0 = 5 * 10 kHz = 50 kHz\n...\n\nThe frequency spectrum will consist of odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency, with decreasing amplitude as the harmonic number increases. In this case, the frequency spectrum will have peaks at 10 kHz, 30 kHz, 50 kHz, and so on, with the amplitude of each peak decreasing as 1/n."
