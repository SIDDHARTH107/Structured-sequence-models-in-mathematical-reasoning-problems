    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg measuring 5 cm and a hypotenuse measuring 13 cm. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe are given that one leg (a) is 5 cm and the hypotenuse (c) is 13 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b). Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n5^2 + b^2 = 13^2\n25 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow, we can solve for b^2:\n\nb^2 = 169 - 25\nb^2 = 144\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find the length of the other leg (b):\n\nb = √144\nb = 12 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is 12 cm."
