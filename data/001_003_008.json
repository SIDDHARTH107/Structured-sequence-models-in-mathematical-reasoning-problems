    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we want to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n\n(2x + 3y = 10) * 2\n4x + 6y = 20\n\nNow we have:\n4x + 6y = 20\n4x - y = -7\n\nNext, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - y) = 20 - (-7)\n4x + 6y - 4x + y = 27\n7y = 27\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 27 / 7\ny = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 10\n2x + 3(3) = 10\n2x + 9 = 10\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n2x = 1\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\nx = 1/2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 1/2 and y = 3."
