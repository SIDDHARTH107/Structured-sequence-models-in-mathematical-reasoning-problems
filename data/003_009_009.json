    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the Law of Cosines. However, in this case, we don't actually need trigonometry since we are given all three side lengths.\n\nThe perimeter of a triangle is simply the sum of the lengths of its three sides. In this case, the triangle has sides of length 10, 15, and 20.\n\nPerimeter = 10 + 15 + 20 = 45\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is 45 units."
