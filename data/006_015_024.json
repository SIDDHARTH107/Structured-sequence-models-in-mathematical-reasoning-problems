Assume that there are 4 weeks in a month and that the probability of experiencing a DoS attack is constant throughout the month.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula, which is used to model the number of events (in this case, DoS attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (a week) with a constant average rate (2 attacks per month).\n\nThe Poisson distribution formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (DoS attacks) in the given time interval (a week)\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events (DoS attacks) per time interval (a week)\n- k is the number of events (DoS attacks) we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828\n\nFirst, we need to find the average rate of DoS attacks per week (λ). Since there are 2 attacks per month and 4 weeks in a month, the average rate per week is:\n\nλ = (2 attacks per month) / (4 weeks per month) = 0.5 attacks per week\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of experiencing at least one DoS attack in a given week. To do this, we can find the probability of experiencing zero DoS attacks and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of zero DoS attacks (k = 0):\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.5) * 0.5^0) / 0! = (e^(-0.5) * 1) / 1 = e^(-0.5)\n\nNow, let's find the probability of experiencing at least one DoS attack:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-0.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 0.60653 ≈ 0.39347\n\nSo, the probability that a network will experience a Denial of Service (DoS) attack in a given week is approximately 0.39347, or 39.35% when rounded to two decimal places."
