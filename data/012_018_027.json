    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph G into two non-empty connected components, we need to remove all the edges from a cut-set. A cut-set is a set of edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph into two or more connected components.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 7 vertices and 14 edges. To minimize the number of edges to be removed, we should aim to disconnect the graph into two connected components with the minimum number of vertices in one of the components.\n\nLet's consider the case where one of the connected components has only one vertex. In this case, the other connected component would have the remaining 6 vertices. In a connected graph, the minimum number of edges required to connect n vertices is n-1. Therefore, the connected component with 6 vertices would have at least 5 edges.\n\nNow, let's consider the cut-set. Since the vertex in the smaller connected component is connected to the larger connected component, there must be at least one edge connecting it to the larger component. Therefore, the minimum number of edges that must be removed from G to disconnect it into two non-empty connected components is 1."
