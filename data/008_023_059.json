    "message_2": "To account for the noise in the system, we can use the least squares method to find the best approximate solution. This method minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the actual values and the predicted values.\n\nFirst, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 0.9  0.4  0.1 |\n    | 0.7 -0.3  0.9 |\n    | 0.6  0.8 -0.5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 7.8 |\n    | 3.1 |\n    | 2.2 |\n\nTo find the least squares solution, we can use the normal equation:\n\nA^T * A * X = A^T * B\n\nwhere A^T is the transpose of matrix A.\n\nFirst, let's find A^T:\n\nA^T = |  0.9  0.7  0.6 |\n      |  0.4 -0.3  0.8 |\n      |  0.1  0.9 -0.5 |\n\nNow, let's find A^T * A:\n\nA^T * A = |  1.42  0.25  0.07 |\n          |  0.25  0.98 -0.31 |\n          |  0.07 -0.31  1.07 |\n\nAnd A^T * B:\n\nA^T * B = |  9.25 |\n          |  1.75 |\n          |  0.45 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of linear equations:\n\n|  1.42  0.25  0.07 | | x |   |  9.25 |\n|  0.25  0.98 -0.31 | | y | = |  1.75 |\n|  0.07 -0.31  1.07 | | z |   |  0.45 |\n\nUsing a numerical method, such as Gaussian elimination or the inverse matrix method, we find the approximate solution:\n\nx ≈ 4.87\ny ≈ 1.96\nz ≈ 1.14\n\nSo, considering the noise in the system, the best approximate solution is x ≈ 4.87, y ≈ 1.96, and z ≈ 1.14."
