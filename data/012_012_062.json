    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the given graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the fact that the graph is connected.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * 14 = 28\n\nSince there are 9 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in the graph is:\n\nAverage degree = (Sum of degrees) / 9 â‰ˆ 3.11\n\nSince the average degree is greater than 3, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or more. Let's consider a vertex V with a degree of 4 or more. Since the graph is connected, there must be a path between any two vertices. \n\nNow, consider the shortest path between vertex V and any of its neighbors, say vertex W. Since V has a degree of 4 or more, there must be at least one other neighbor of V, say vertex X, that is not on the shortest path between V and W. \n\nSince the graph is connected, there must be a path between W and X. This path, together with the edges (V, W) and (V, X), forms a cycle. The shortest such cycle will have a length of 3, as it consists of the edges (V, W), (W, X), and (V, X).\n\nTherefore, the girth of the given graph is 3."
