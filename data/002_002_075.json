    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 5 meters. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5^3)\nV = (4/3) * π * 125\nV = 500/3 * π\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 meters is approximately 523.6 cubic meters (rounded to one decimal place)."
