    "message_1": "A company produces a product with a fixed cost of $10,000 and a variable cost of $100 per unit. The current price of the product is $200 per unit and they sell 1,000 units per month. The company wants to maximize their profit. What should be the new price of the product to achieve maximum profit and how many units should they produce and sell at that price?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price and quantity to maximize profit, we can use the concept of price elasticity of demand. Price elasticity of demand (Ed) is a measure of how sensitive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. It is calculated as:\n\nEd = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price)\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to directly calculate the price elasticity of demand. Instead, we can use the following formula to find the optimal price (P*) and quantity (Q*):\n\nP* = (MC * (1 + (1 / Ed))) / (1 + (1 / Ed))\n\nWhere MC is the marginal cost, which is equal to the variable cost per unit.\n\nIn this case, MC = $100.\n\nTo find the optimal price and quantity, we need to know the price elasticity of demand (Ed) for the product. Unfortunately, we don't have this information. However, we can provide a general guideline for the company to follow:\n\n1. If the demand for the product is elastic (Ed > 1), the company should lower the price to increase the quantity demanded and maximize profit.\n2. If the demand for the product is inelastic (Ed < 1), the company should raise the price to increase revenue and maximize profit.\n3. If the demand for the product is unit elastic (Ed = 1), the company is already maximizing its profit at the current price and quantity.\n\nTo determine the optimal price and quantity, the company should conduct market research to estimate the price elasticity of demand for their product. Once they have this information, they can use the formula above to find the optimal price and quantity to maximize their profit."
