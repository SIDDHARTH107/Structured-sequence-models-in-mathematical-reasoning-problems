    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products AxB and BxA.\n\nAxB = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\nBxA = {(2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of AxB and BxA.\n\nIntersection(AxB, BxA) = {(2,2)}\n\nThe intersection contains only one element, (2,2). Now let's compare the original Cartesian products AxB and BxA.\n\nAxB = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\nBxA = {(2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}\n\nAs we can see, AxB and BxA are not equal, since they have different elements. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
