    "message_2": "To determine if X is compact, we need to check if every open cover of X has a finite subcover. In the standard topology on the real numbers, open sets are unions of open intervals.\n\nConsider an open cover of X, which is a collection of open sets whose union contains X. Since X is a finite set, we can always find a finite subcollection of open sets that cover X. For example, for each element x in X, there must be at least one open set in the open cover that contains x. We can take the union of these open sets, and since there are only 5 elements in X, we have a finite subcover.\n\nTherefore, X is compact in the standard topology on the real numbers."
