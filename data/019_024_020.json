    "message_1": "A math student is given the following abductive logic problem:\n\nThere are three bags on a table labeled as Bag 1, Bag 2, and Bag 3. Bag 1 contains two white marbles, Bag 2 contains two black marbles, and Bag 3 contains one white and one black marble. A marble is drawn from one of the bags, and it is found to be white. What is the probability that it was drawn from Bag 1?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability. We want to find the probability that the white marble was drawn from Bag 1, given that a white marble was drawn. We can denote this as P(Bag 1 | White).\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can write this as:\n\nP(Bag 1 | White) = P(White | Bag 1) * P(Bag 1) / P(White)\n\nFirst, let's find the individual probabilities:\n\n1. P(White | Bag 1) = 2/2 = 1 (since both marbles in Bag 1 are white)\n2. P(Bag 1) = 1/3 (since there are three bags)\n3. P(White) = P(White | Bag 1) * P(Bag 1) + P(White | Bag 2) * P(Bag 2) + P(White | Bag 3) * P(Bag 3)\n\nFor P(White | Bag 2), there are no white marbles in Bag 2, so the probability is 0. For P(White | Bag 3), there is one white marble and one black marble, so the probability is 1/2.\n\nSo, P(White) = (1 * 1/3) + (0 * 1/3) + (1/2 * 1/3) = 1/3 + 0 + 1/6 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(Bag 1 | White) = (1 * 1/3) / (1/2) = 1/3 * 2/1 = 2/3\n\nTherefore, the probability that the white marble was drawn from Bag 1 is 2/3 or approximately 0.67."
