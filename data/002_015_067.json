    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter is 20 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(20)\nC ≈ 3.14 * 20\nC ≈ 62.8 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 62.8 cm."
