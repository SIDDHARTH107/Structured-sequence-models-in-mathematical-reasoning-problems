    "message_2": "To find the area of the pizza slice, we need to determine the central angle of the slice. We can do this by using the formula for the arc length:\n\nArc length = radius × central angle (in radians)\n\nGiven the arc length is 7 cm and the radius is 14 cm, we can set up the equation:\n\n7 = 14 × central angle\n\nNow, we can solve for the central angle:\n\ncentral angle = 7 / 14\ncentral angle = 0.5 radians\n\nNow that we have the central angle, we can find the area of the pizza slice using the formula for the area of a sector:\n\nArea = 0.5 × radius × radius × central angle\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nArea = 0.5 × 14 × 14 × 0.5\nArea = 49 cm²\n\nThe area of the pizza slice is 49 square centimeters."
