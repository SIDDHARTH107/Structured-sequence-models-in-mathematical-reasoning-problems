The length of the Hilbert curve at each order can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nLength of the nth order Hilbert curve = (Length of the first order curve) * (2^n - 1)\n\nIn this case, the length of the first order curve is 1 unit, and we want to find the length of the 6th order curve.\n\nLength of the 6th order Hilbert curve = 1 * (2^6 - 1)\nLength of the 6th order Hilbert curve = 1 * (64 - 1)\nLength of the 6th order Hilbert curve = 1 * 63\nLength of the 6th order Hilbert curve = 63 units"
