    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph and then determine the maximum number of vertices in any bag.\n\nA possible tree decomposition of the given graph is:\n\n```\n  1\n / \\\n2   3\n```\n\nWhere the bags are:\n1. {A, B, C}\n2. {B, D, E}\n3. {C, E, F, G}\n\nThe maximum number of vertices in any bag is 4 (in bag 3). Therefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 4 - 1 = 3."
