    "message_2": "To find a conformal mapping from the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ to the region bounded by the cardioid $\\rho = 1 + \\cos(\\theta)$, we will use a composition of known conformal mappings.\n\n1. First, we map the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ to the upper half-plane using the MÃ¶bius transformation $f_1(z) = i\\frac{1+z}{1-z}$. This transformation maps the unit disk to the upper half-plane, with $0$ being mapped to $i$.\n\n2. Next, we map the upper half-plane to the region bounded by the cardioid. To do this, we first map the upper half-plane to the exterior of the unit disk using the transformation $f_2(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. This transformation maps the upper half-plane to the exterior of the unit disk, with $i$ being mapped to $1$.\n\n3. Now, we need to map the exterior of the unit disk to the interior of the cardioid. To do this, we use the transformation $f_3(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(z + 1)$. This transformation maps the exterior of the unit disk to the interior of the cardioid, with $1$ being mapped to the cusp of the cardioid.\n\nThe composition of these transformations gives us the desired conformal mapping from the unit disk to the region bounded by the cardioid:\n\n$$f(z) = f_3(f_2(f_1(z))) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{i\\frac{1+z}{1-z}} + 1\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{(1-z) + i(1+z)}{1+z}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1 - z + i(1 + z)}{1 + z}\\right)$$\n\nSo, the conformal mapping from the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ to the region bounded by the cardioid $\\rho = 1 + \\cos(\\theta)$ is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1 - z + i(1 + z)}{1 + z}\\right)$$"
