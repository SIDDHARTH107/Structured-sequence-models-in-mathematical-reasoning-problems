    "message_2": "To find the z-score of a student who scored 85 on the test, we can use the following formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the student's score, μ is the average score, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 85, μ = 75, and σ = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (85 - 75) / 10\nz = 10 / 10\nz = 1\n\nSo, the z-score of a student who scored 85 on the test is 1."
