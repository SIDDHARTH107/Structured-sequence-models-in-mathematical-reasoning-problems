    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is connected or not, we can use the following criterion:\n\nA graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and there is no cycle in the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. The minimum number of edges required for a connected graph with 10 vertices is (10-1) = 9 edges. Since our graph has 15 edges, it has more than the minimum required edges.\n\nHowever, having more than the minimum required edges does not guarantee that the graph is connected. We also need to check if there are any cycles in the graph. Unfortunately, we cannot determine if there are cycles in the graph without more information about the specific connections between vertices.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine if the graph is connected or not."
