    "message_2": "We are given that $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ and that $f(z)$ is real for all $z$ on the imaginary axis. We will use the Schwarz reflection principle to find $f(z)$ for all $z$ in the upper half-plane.\n\nFirst, let's define a function $g(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$\ng(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) & \\text{if } \\Im(z) > 0 \\\\\n\\overline{f(\\overline{z})} & \\text{if } \\Im(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the upper half-plane and $f(z)$ is real on the imaginary axis, it follows that $g(z)$ is holomorphic in the lower half-plane. Moreover, $g(z)$ is continuous on the imaginary axis because $f(z)$ is real on the imaginary axis.\n\nNow, we can apply the Schwarz reflection principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic in the upper half-plane, continuous on the real axis, and its values on the real axis are real, then the function can be analytically continued to the lower half-plane by reflecting it across the real axis. In our case, this means that $g(z)$ can be analytically continued to the entire complex plane by setting $g(z) = f(z)$ for all $z$ in the lower half-plane.\n\nSince $g(z)$ is now holomorphic in the entire complex plane, it must be an entire function. By Liouville's theorem, any bounded entire function is constant. However, we are not given any information about the boundedness of $g(z)$, so we cannot conclude that $g(z)$ is constant.\n\nIn summary, we have found a function $g(z)$ that agrees with $f(z)$ in the upper half-plane and is holomorphic in the entire complex plane. However, without further information about the boundedness of $g(z)$, we cannot determine $f(z)$ for all $z$ in the upper half-plane."
