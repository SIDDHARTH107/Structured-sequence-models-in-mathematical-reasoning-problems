    "message_1": "A bookstore has 7 different books on a display rack. In how many ways can a customer choose 3 books to buy if the books must be bought in increasing order of height, with the shortest book at the front of the stack and the tallest book at the back?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. Since the order of the books is already determined by their height, we just need to find the number of ways to choose 3 books out of 7.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (total number of books) and k = 3 (number of books to choose).\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\n\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 different ways for a customer to choose 3 books in increasing order of height."
