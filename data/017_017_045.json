    "message_2": "To prove that G has a normal subgroup of order 5 or 3, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p of the order of G. Let's denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p as n_p.\n\n1. For p = 2, n_2 must divide 15 (the index of 2 in 30) and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n2. For p = 3, n_3 must divide 10 (the index of 3 in 30) and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 or 10.\n3. For p = 5, n_5 must divide 6 (the index of 5 in 30) and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possible values for n_5 are 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we know that if n_p = 1 for some prime p, then the corresponding Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G. Let's consider the cases for p = 3 and p = 5.\n\nIf n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, which we will denote as P_3. Since it is unique, it must be normal in G.\n\nIf n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, which we will denote as P_5. Since it is unique, it must be normal in G.\n\nIn either case, G has a normal subgroup of order 3 or 5.\n\nNow, let's use this fact to show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\n1. If G has normal subgroups of both orders 3 and 5, then G has a normal subgroup P_3 of order 3 and a normal subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since the orders of P_3 and P_5 are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and their product is of order 15. By the internal direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_3 and P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 30, C30.\n\n2. If G has a normal subgroup of order 3 but not of order 5, then G has a normal subgroup P_3 of order 3 and a non-normal Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_3 and P_5, which is the dihedral group of order 30, D15.\n\n3. If G has a normal subgroup of order 5 but not of order 3, then G has a normal subgroup P_5 of order 5 and a non-normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. In this case, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_5 and P_3, which is a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nThus, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
