    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student weighs between 50kg and 70kg, we need to calculate the z-scores for both 50kg and 70kg and then find the area under the normal distribution curve between these two z-scores.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\n\nwhere x is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor 50kg:\nz1 = (50 - 60) / 5 = -10 / 5 = -2\n\nFor 70kg:\nz2 = (70 - 60) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between z1 and z2. We can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nFor z1 = -2, the probability is 0.0228 (2.28%).\nFor z2 = 2, the probability is 0.9772 (97.72%).\n\nTo find the probability between these two z-scores, we subtract the probability of z1 from the probability of z2:\n\nP(50kg < weight < 70kg) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student weighs between 50kg and 70kg is approximately 0.9544 or 95.44%."
