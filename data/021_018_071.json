    "message_2": "To use the tabu search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the starting point (x0) and the tabu list.\n2. Generate the neighborhood of the current solution.\n3. Select the best non-tabu solution from the neighborhood.\n4. Update the tabu list and the current solution.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet's start with x0 = 0 (an arbitrary starting point within the domain) and an empty tabu list.\n\nIteration 1:\nCurrent solution: x = 0\nTabu list: []\nNeighborhood: {-3, -1, 1, 3}\nBest non-tabu solution: x = 3 (f(3) = 9)\n\nIteration 2:\nCurrent solution: x = 3\nTabu list: [0]\nNeighborhood: {0, 2, 4}\nBest non-tabu solution: x = 4 (f(4) = 16)\n\nIteration 3:\nCurrent solution: x = 4\nTabu list: [0, 3]\nNeighborhood: {1, 3, 5}\nBest non-tabu solution: x = 5 (f(5) = 25)\n\nIteration 4:\nCurrent solution: x = 5\nTabu list: [0, 3, 4]\nNeighborhood: {2, 4, -5}\nBest non-tabu solution: x = -5 (f(-5) = -95)\n\nIteration 5:\nCurrent solution: x = -5\nTabu list: [0, 3, 4, 5]\nNeighborhood: {-2, 5, -3}\nBest non-tabu solution: x = -2 (f(-2) = 0)\n\nIteration 6:\nCurrent solution: x = -2\nTabu list: [3, 4, 5, -5]\nNeighborhood: {-5, 1, -1}\nBest non-tabu solution: x = 1 (f(1) = -1)\n\nWe can continue this process for more iterations, but it appears that the maximum value found so far is f(5) = 25. Note that the tabu search algorithm is a heuristic method, and the results may vary depending on the starting point, tabu list size, and neighborhood size. However, in this case, the maximum value of f(x) is 25, and the corresponding value of x is 5."
