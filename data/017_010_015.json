    "message_2": "There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 10, and they are the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5.\n\nTo show this, we first note that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 10 = 2 * 5, a group of order 10 has a 2-Sylow subgroup of order 2 and a 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups divides 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2, so there is exactly one 2-Sylow subgroup. Similarly, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups divides 2 and is congruent to 1 mod 5, so there is exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup.\n\nLet G be a group of order 10, and let P be its unique 2-Sylow subgroup and Q be its unique 5-Sylow subgroup. Since P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Thus, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q.\n\nNow, P is a group of order 2, so it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2. Similarly, Q is a group of order 5, so it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5. Therefore, G ≅ C2 × C5.\n\nSince C2 and C5 are both cyclic, their direct product can be either cyclic or non-cyclic. If it is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10. If it is non-cyclic, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, which is the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 10, and they are the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5."
