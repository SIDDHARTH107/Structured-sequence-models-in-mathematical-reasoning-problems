    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros with multiplicity for the complex function f(z) = z^4 - 4z^3 + 13z^2 - 4z + 4 in the unit disk |z|<1, we can apply the Argument Principle.\n\nThe Argument Principle states that for a meromorphic function f(z) in a simply connected domain D, if f(z) has no zeros or poles on the boundary of D, then the number of zeros minus the number of poles of f(z) inside D is given by:\n\n(1/2π) * ∮(∂D) (f'(z) / f(z)) dz\n\nHere, f(z) is a polynomial, so it has no poles. Thus, we only need to find the number of zeros inside the unit disk.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of f(z):\n\nf'(z) = 4z^3 - 12z^2 + 26z - 4\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the contour integral:\n\n(1/2π) * ∮(∂D) (f'(z) / f(z)) dz\n\nLet z = e^(iθ) be a parameterization of the unit circle, where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. Then, dz = ie^(iθ) dθ.\n\nSubstitute z = e^(iθ) into f(z) and f'(z):\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = e^(4iθ) - 4e^(3iθ) + 13e^(2iθ) - 4e^(iθ) + 4\n\nf'(e^(iθ)) = 4e^(3iθ) - 12e^(2iθ) + 26e^(iθ) - 4\n\nNow, substitute these expressions and dz into the contour integral:\n\n(1/2π) * ∮(∂D) (f'(z) / f(z)) dz = (1/2π) * ∫(0 to 2π) (f'(e^(iθ)) / f(e^(iθ))) * ie^(iθ) dθ\n\nThis integral is difficult to evaluate directly. However, we can use the fact that the integrand is holomorphic (analytic) inside the unit disk, and the integral evaluates to an integer value (the number of zeros with multiplicity). By observing the function f(z), we can see that it has no zeros on the unit circle, as |f(e^(iθ))| > 0 for all θ.\n\nNow, let's examine the behavior of f(z) near the origin. As |z| approaches 0, the dominant terms are 13z^2 and -4z. Thus, f(z) ≈ 13z^2 - 4z near the origin. This function has a double zero at z = 0, which is inside the unit disk.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros with multiplicity for the complex function f(z) = z^4 - 4z^3 + 13z^2 - 4z + 4 in the unit disk |z|<1 is 2."
