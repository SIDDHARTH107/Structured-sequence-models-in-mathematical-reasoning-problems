    "message_2": "To prove the statement using natural deduction, we will start by assuming that n is an even integer and then show that n^2 is an even integer using the definition of even integers.\n\nDefinition: An integer is even if it can be expressed as 2k, where k is an integer.\n\nProof:\n\n1. Assume n is an even integer.\n2. By definition of even integers, n = 2k, where k is an integer.\n3. Now, we want to show that n^2 is an even integer.\n4. Calculate n^2: n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2).\n5. Let m = 2k^2, where m is an integer (since k is an integer, k^2 is an integer, and 2 times an integer is an integer).\n6. Thus, n^2 = 2m, where m is an integer.\n7. By definition of even integers, n^2 is an even integer.\n\nTherefore, if n is an even integer, then n^2 is an even integer."
