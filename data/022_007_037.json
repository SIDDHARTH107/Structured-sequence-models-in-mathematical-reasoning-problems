    "message_2": "Let's rewrite the expression as follows:\n\n$|z^2 + 2z + 2| = |(z + 1)^2 + 1|$\n\nNow, let $w = z + 1$. Then, the expression becomes:\n\n$|w^2 + 1|$\n\nWe want to minimize the distance between $w^2 + 1$ and the origin in the complex plane. To do this, let's find the distance between $w^2$ and $-1$.\n\nUsing the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n$|w^2 - (-1)| \\ge |w^2| - |-1|$\n\n$|w^2 + 1| \\ge |w^2| - 1$\n\nSince $|w^2|$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $|w^2 + 1|$ occurs when $|w^2| = 1$. This happens when $|w| = 1$ (i.e., $w$ lies on the unit circle in the complex plane).\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of $|z^2 + 2z + 2|$ is $\\boxed{0}$."
