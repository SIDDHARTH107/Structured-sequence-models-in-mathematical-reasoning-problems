    "message_2": "To prove that the group G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, we will first examine the properties of the given group G and then compare them to the properties of C4 and V4.\n\nThe given group G has the following operation table:\n\n\\begin{matrix} e & a & b & c \\\\ a & e & c & b \\\\ b & c & e & a \\\\ c & b & a & e \\end{matrix}\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the group G has the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: The result of any operation between elements of G is also an element of G.\n2. Associativity: The operation is associative, as required for a group.\n3. Identity: The element 'e' is the identity element, as e * a = a * e = a, e * b = b * e = b, and e * c = c * e = c.\n4. Inverse: Each element has an inverse in G, as a * c = c * a = e, b * b = e, and c * b = b * c = e.\n\nNow, let's examine the properties of the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n\nC4 = {1, r, r^2, r^3}, where r is a generator and the operation is multiplication modulo 4. The properties of C4 are:\n\n1. It is generated by a single element 'r'.\n2. The order of the generator 'r' is 4, meaning r^4 = 1.\n3. Each element in C4 has an order that divides 4.\n\nV4 = {1, x, y, z}, where the operation is multiplication and the elements satisfy the following relations:\n\n1. x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = 1\n2. xy = z, yx = z\n3. xz = y, zx = y\n4. yz = x, zy = x\n\nNow, let's compare the properties of G with C4 and V4.\n\nComparing G with C4:\n- G does not seem to be generated by a single element, as no element in G has order 4. For example, a * a = e, b * b = e, and c * c = a * a = e. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to C4.\n\nComparing G with V4:\n- The elements of G satisfy the relations of V4: a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e, ab = c, ba = c, ac = b, ca = b, and bc = a, cb = a.\n- The order of each element in G divides 4: |a| = 2, |b| = 2, |c| = 2.\n\nSince G satisfies the properties of V4, we can conclude that the group G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
