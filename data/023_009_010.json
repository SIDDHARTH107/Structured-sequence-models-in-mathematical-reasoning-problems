    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nA vibrating string is fixed at both ends and has a length of 10 cm. The initial displacement of the string is given by f(x) = x(10-x), where x represents distance along the string. Use the Fourier transform to find a solution to the wave equation for this string subject to the boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(10,t) = 0.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Fourier series representation of the initial displacement function f(x) and then apply the wave equation to find the solution u(x, t) subject to the given boundary conditions.\n\n1. Find the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nSince f(x) is an even function, we only need to find the cosine terms in the Fourier series representation. The general formula for the Fourier series of an even function is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function, a_0 is the constant term, and a_n are the coefficients of the cosine terms.\n\nFor this problem, L = 10/2 = 5. To find a_0 and a_n, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nCalculating a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/5) * ∫[x(10-x) dx] from 0 to 5\na_0 = (1/5) * [5x^2 - (1/3)x^3] from 0 to 5\na_0 = (1/5) * (125 - 125/3) = 50/3\n\nCalculating a_n:\n\na_n = (2/5) * ∫[x(10-x) * cos(nπx/5) dx] from 0 to 5\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts twice. After doing so, we get:\n\na_n = (20/n^2π^2) * (-1)^n\n\n2. Apply the wave equation:\n\nThe general solution to the wave equation for a vibrating string with fixed ends is:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ[b_n * sin(nπx/L) * cos(nπct/L)]\n\nwhere b_n are the coefficients of the sine terms and c is the wave speed.\n\nSince the initial displacement is given by f(x), we have:\n\nu(x, 0) = f(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L)]\n\nComparing this with the general solution, we see that:\n\nb_n = a_n\n\nSo, the solution to the wave equation for this string is:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ[(20/n^2π^2) * (-1)^n * sin(nπx/5) * cos(nπct/5)]\n\nThis is the solution to the wave equation for the given vibrating string with the initial displacement f(x) = x(10-x) and boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(10,t) = 0."
