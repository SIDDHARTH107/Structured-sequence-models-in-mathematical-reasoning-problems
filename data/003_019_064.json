    "message_2": "To find the integral of the function f(x) = 5cos(x) over the range (0, π/2), we will integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the result at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of cos(x) with respect to x is sin(x). So, the integral of 5cos(x) with respect to x is:\n\n∫(5cos(x)) dx = 5∫(cos(x)) dx = 5sin(x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral at the given limits:\n\n5sin(x) | from 0 to π/2\n\n= 5sin(π/2) - 5sin(0)\n\n= 5(1) - 5(0)\n\n= 5 - 0\n\n= 5\n\nSo, the integral of the function f(x) = 5cos(x) over the range (0, π/2) is 5."
