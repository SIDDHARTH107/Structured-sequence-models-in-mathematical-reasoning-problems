    "message_2": "A cut vertex (or articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\n```\n   1 -- 2 -- 5 -- 6\n   |    |         |\n   3 -- 4         7 -- 8\n```\n\nCut vertices:\n1. Vertex 2: If we remove vertex 2, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 3, 4} and {5, 6, 7, 8}.\n2. Vertex 5: If we remove vertex 5, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {6, 7, 8}.\n\nBridges:\n1. Edge (2, 5): If we remove edge (2, 5), the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {5, 6, 7, 8}.\n\nSo, the cut vertices are 2 and 5, and the bridge is edge (2, 5)."
