    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two types of products, type A and type B. The profit obtained from each unit of type A is $4 and from each unit of type B is $5. The company has a daily production capacity of 1000 units. It takes 2 hours to produce one unit of type A and 3 hours to produce one unit of type B. Also, the company has limited resources and can only allocate a maximum of 2000 hours of production time per day. \n\nUsing the bat algorithm, determine the number of units of each product the company should produce to maximize their daily profit.",
    "message_2": "The bat algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. However, this problem can be solved using linear programming, which is a more suitable approach for this type of problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units of type A produced and y be the number of units of type B produced.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit): P = 4x + 5y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production capacity: x + y ≤ 1000\n2. Production time: 2x + 3y ≤ 2000\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\ny ≤ 1000 - x\ny ≤ (2000 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and identifying the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nVertices of the feasible region:\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 1000)\nC: (1000, 0)\nD: (600, 400)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nA: P(0, 0) = 4(0) + 5(0) = 0\nB: P(0, 1000) = 4(0) + 5(1000) = 5000\nC: P(1000, 0) = 4(1000) + 5(0) = 4000\nD: P(600, 400) = 4(600) + 5(400) = 2400 + 2000 = 4400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B, where the company produces 0 units of type A and 1000 units of type B, resulting in a daily profit of $5000."
