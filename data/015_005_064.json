    "message_2": "Calculating the Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler system with given parameter values requires numerical methods, as there is no closed-form solution. The Rössler system is a set of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nWith the given parameter values a = 0.15, b = 0.2, and c = 10, we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent using numerical methods such as the Wolf algorithm or the Rosenstein algorithm. However, these calculations are beyond the scope of a simple text-based response.\n\nTo find the Lyapunov exponent for this specific Rössler system, you can use specialized software or programming languages like MATLAB or Python with appropriate libraries (e.g., scipy, numpy) to perform the numerical calculations."
