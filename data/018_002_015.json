    "message_2": "To show that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively, we need to find the elements that are common to both sets A and B, and then show that these elements are indeed part of both sets.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of sets A and B, which is denoted by A ∩ B.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of A and B, we can see that the only common element is 6. Therefore:\n\nA ∩ B = {6}\n\nNow, we need to show that {6} is a subset of A and B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all contained in another set. In this case, we need to show that all elements of A ∩ B are contained in A and B.\n\nSince 6 is an element of A and B, it's clear that {6} is a subset of both A and B.\n\nThus, A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively."
