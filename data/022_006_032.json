Using the maximum modulus principle, show that there exists a complex number z_0 such that |f(z_0)| >= 2. \n\nIn other words, the task is to demonstrate that the magnitude (or absolute value) of the complex function f(z) reaches a minimum of at least 2 in some point of the complex plane. The student would need to apply the maximum modulus principle, which states that if f is a holomorphic function (differentiable in the complex sense) in a region containing a closed bounded set S, then |f(z)| cannot achieve a maximum in S' interior, but only on S' boundary (or edge). From there, the student would need to construct an argument or calculation that shows that |f(z)| >= 2 for some specific z_0.",
    "message_2": "To show that there exists a complex number z_0 such that |f(z_0)| >= 2, we will use the maximum modulus principle. \n\nFirst, let's consider a closed disk D with center 0 and radius R > 0 in the complex plane. The function f(z) = z^2 + 1 is holomorphic (analytic) everywhere in the complex plane, so it is also holomorphic in the region containing the disk D.\n\nNow, let's examine the boundary of the disk, which is a circle with radius R. On this circle, z = Re^(iθ) for 0 <= θ <= 2π. We can write f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = f(Re^(iθ)) = (Re^(iθ))^2 + 1 = R^2e^(2iθ) + 1\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |R^2e^(2iθ) + 1|\n\nUsing the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n|f(z)| >= |R^2e^(2iθ)| - |1| = R^2 - 1\n\nAs R > 0, we can choose R = sqrt(2), so R^2 - 1 = 1. Therefore, on the boundary of the disk D, we have:\n\n|f(z)| >= 2\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic in the region containing the disk D, the maximum modulus principle states that the maximum of |f(z)| cannot be achieved in the interior of the disk, but only on its boundary. Thus, there exists a complex number z_0 on the boundary of the disk D such that |f(z_0)| >= 2."
