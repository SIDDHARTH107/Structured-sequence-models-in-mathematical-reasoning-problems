    "message_2": "The given statement is false.\n\nTo see why, let's first understand what each side of the equation represents.\n\n(A x B) represents the Cartesian product of sets A and B, which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\n(A x B) ∩ C represents the intersection of the Cartesian product (A x B) with set C. This would include all elements that are both in (A x B) and in C. However, since the elements of (A x B) are ordered pairs and the elements of C are not, their intersection will be an empty set, unless C itself contains ordered pairs that match those in (A x B).\n\nOn the other hand, B ∩ C represents the intersection of sets B and C, which includes all elements that are both in B and in C.\n\nA x (B ∩ C) represents the Cartesian product of set A with the intersection of sets B and C. This consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of (B ∩ C).\n\nNow, let's consider an example to show that the given statement is false.\n\nLet A = {1}, B = {2}, and C = {2}. Then,\n\n(A x B) = {(1, 2)}\n(B ∩ C) = {2}\nA x (B ∩ C) = {(1, 2)}\n\nHowever, (A x B) ∩ C = ∅ (empty set) since there are no elements in C that are ordered pairs.\n\nSo, (A x B) ∩ C ≠ A x (B ∩ C), and the given statement is false."
