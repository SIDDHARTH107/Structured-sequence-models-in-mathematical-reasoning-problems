    "message_2": "First, we note that G has order 18, and since a^9 = e, the order of a is 9. Therefore, the subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, is a cyclic group of order 9. Since 9 divides 18, by Lagrange's theorem, <a> is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the element b. Since b^2 = a^3, the order of b is either 2 or 6. If the order of b is 6, then G would be a cyclic group of order 18 (generated by a^3 * b), which is isomorphic to C18. So, let's assume the order of b is 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the set H = {e, b, a^3*b}. We can verify that H is a subgroup of G:\n\n1. Closure: (a^3*b)(a^3*b) = a^3 * (b*a^3*b) = a^3 * a^4 = a^7, which is in G.\n2. Identity: e is in H.\n3. Inverses: The inverse of b is b, and the inverse of a^3*b is a^6*b.\n\nSince the order of H is 3, by Lagrange's theorem, H is also a normal subgroup of G. Now, we have two normal subgroups, <a> and H, with orders 9 and 3, respectively. Their intersection is trivial, as the only common element is the identity e. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of <a> and H, which means G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a group of order 3.\n\nNow, let's check if G is non-abelian. We have bab^-1 = a^4, so ba = a^4b. Since ba â‰  ab, G is non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18."
