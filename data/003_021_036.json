    "message_1": "Two planes are flying towards each other. The velocity of the first plane is 300 km/hr, and the velocity of the second plane is 400 km/hr. If the angle between their initial directions of motion is 30 degrees, what is the angle between their paths just before they collide? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the velocity of the first plane as V1 and the velocity of the second plane as V2. We are given that V1 = 300 km/hr and V2 = 400 km/hr. The angle between their initial directions of motion is 30 degrees.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle between their paths just before they collide. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = V1, b = V2, and C is the angle between their paths just before they collide. We can denote the relative velocity between the two planes as Vr. Then, we can write the equation as:\n\nVr^2 = V1^2 + V2^2 - 2 * V1 * V2 * cos(30)\n\nWe know that cos(30) = √3 / 2. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nVr^2 = (300)^2 + (400)^2 - 2 * 300 * 400 * (√3 / 2)\n\nVr^2 = 90000 + 160000 - 300 * 400 * √3\n\nVr^2 = 250000 - 120000 * √3\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find the angle between their paths just before they collide. The Law of Sines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite to the respective sides:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nIn our case, we want to find angle C. We can write the equation as:\n\nV1 / sin(30) = V2 / sin(B) = Vr / sin(C)\n\nWe know that sin(30) = 1/2. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n300 / (1/2) = 400 / sin(B) = Vr / sin(C)\n\n600 = 400 / sin(B) = Vr / sin(C)\n\nNow, we can solve for sin(B):\n\nsin(B) = 400 / 600 = 2/3\n\nNow, we can find angle B:\n\nB = arcsin(2/3)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nA + B + C = 180\n\nWe know that A = 30, so:\n\n30 + B + C = 180\n\nPlugging in the value of B, we get:\n\n30 + arcsin(2/3) + C = 180\n\nNow, we can solve for angle C:\n\nC = 180 - 30 - arcsin(2/3)\n\nC ≈ 180 - 30 - 41.81\n\nC ≈ 108.19 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between their paths just before they collide is approximately 108.19 degrees."
