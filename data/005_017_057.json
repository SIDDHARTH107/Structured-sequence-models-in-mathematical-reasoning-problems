    "message_2": "To find the weightage of each product in the first two principal components, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a matrix with the given data.\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix of the data matrix.\n3. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n4. Select the first two eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues.\n5. Project the data onto the first two eigenvectors to get the weightage of each product in the first two principal components.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Data matrix:\n\n   ```\n   X = [[10, 12, 8, 14, 16, 18, 20, 15, 10, 14, 18, 22],\n        [15, 18, 12, 20, 22, 25, 28, 20, 16, 18, 24, 30],\n        [5, 8, 4, 6, 10, 12, 8, 6, 4, 10, 12, 14],\n        [20, 25, 18, 22, 28, 30, 35, 30, 25, 24, 30, 38],\n        [8, 10, 6, 12, 14, 16, 12, 8, 6, 10, 14, 18]]\n   ```\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix:\n\n   ```\n   Cov(X) = [[21.1667, 23.8333, 7.6667, 32.3333, 16.1667],\n             [23.8333, 32.3333, 9.6667, 43.8333, 21.8333],\n             [7.6667, 9.6667, 9.6667, 14.6667, 7.6667],\n             [32.3333, 43.8333, 14.6667, 60.3333, 30.3333],\n             [16.1667, 21.8333, 7.6667, 30.3333, 15.1667]]\n   ```\n\n3. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues:\n\n   Eigenvalues: [126.943, 2.057, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000]\n   Eigenvectors: [[-0.389, -0.919, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000],\n                  [-0.528, 0.396, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000],\n                  [-0.164, 0.000, 1.000, 0.000, 0.000],\n                  [-0.707, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000, 0.000],\n                  [-0.354, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000]]\n\n4. Select the first two eigenvectors:\n\n   ```\n   PC1 = [-0.389, -0.528, -0.164, -0.707, -0.354]\n   PC2 = [-0.919, 0.396, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000]\n   ```\n\n5. Project the data onto the first two eigenvectors:\n\n   ```\n   Weightages = X * [PC1, PC2]\n   ```\n\n   ```\n   Weightages = [[-1.846, 0.396],\n                 [-2.640, 0.792],\n                 [-0.820, 0.000],\n                 [-3.534, 0.000],\n                 [-1.770, 0.000]]\n   ```\n\nSo, the weightage of each product in the first two principal components is:\n\n   Product A: [-1.846, 0.396]\n   Product B: [-2.640, 0.792]\n   Product C: [-0.820, 0.000]\n   Product D: [-3.534, 0.000]\n   Product E: [-1.770, 0.000]"
