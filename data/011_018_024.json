    "message_1": "A company is conducting a market research survey to determine preferences towards their new line of products. They randomly select 25 participants from a pool of 1000 potential customers. Each participant is asked to rate 10 products on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest rating and 5 being the highest rating. \n\nHow many ways can the survey results be arranged if the ratings for each product are independent of each other?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 25 participants, each rating 10 products on a scale of 1 to 5, there are a total of 25 * 10 = 250 individual ratings given.\n\nFor each of these 250 ratings, there are 5 possible choices (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Since the ratings for each product are independent of each other, we can simply multiply the number of choices for each rating together to find the total number of ways the survey results can be arranged.\n\nSo, the total number of ways the survey results can be arranged is 5^250."
