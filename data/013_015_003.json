    "message_1": "Consider a principal who wants to hire an agent to produce a project with a budget of $10,000. The agent can choose to exert high effort or low effort. The cost of exerting high effort is $6,000, and the cost of exerting low effort is $3,000. If the agent exerts high effort, the project value will be $18,000, and if the agent exerts low effort, the project value will be $12,000. Assuming that the principal and the agent have conflicting interests, what is the optimal contract that maximizes the principal's payoff and minimizes the agent's payoff? What is the expected payoffs of the principal and the agent under the optimal contract?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal contract, we need to consider the incentives for the agent to exert high effort or low effort. We will denote the agent's payment for high effort as P_H and for low effort as P_L.\n\nFirst, let's consider the agent's payoff for each effort level:\n\nAgent's payoff for high effort = Project value with high effort - Cost of high effort - P_H\nAgent's payoff for low effort = Project value with low effort - Cost of low effort - P_L\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the agent has an incentive to exert high effort. This means that the agent's payoff for high effort should be greater than or equal to the agent's payoff for low effort:\n\nProject value with high effort - Cost of high effort - P_H >= Project value with low effort - Cost of low effort - P_L\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$18,000 - $6,000 - P_H >= $12,000 - $3,000 - P_L\n\nNow, we want to minimize the agent's payoff, so we will set the inequality as an equality:\n\n$12,000 - P_H = $9,000 - P_L\n\nNow, we want to maximize the principal's payoff, which is the difference between the project value and the payment to the agent:\n\nPrincipal's payoff for high effort = Project value with high effort - P_H\nPrincipal's payoff for low effort = Project value with low effort - P_L\n\nSince we want the agent to exert high effort, we will focus on maximizing the principal's payoff for high effort:\n\nPrincipal's payoff for high effort = $18,000 - P_H\n\nTo maximize this, we need to minimize P_H. From the equality we derived earlier:\n\nP_H = $3,000 + P_L\n\nSubstituting this into the principal's payoff for high effort:\n\nPrincipal's payoff for high effort = $18,000 - ($3,000 + P_L)\n\nTo minimize P_H, we need to minimize P_L. The lowest possible value for P_L is the cost of low effort, which is $3,000. This is because if P_L is less than the cost of low effort, the agent will not accept the contract.\n\nSo, the optimal contract is:\n\nP_H = $3,000 + $3,000 = $6,000\nP_L = $3,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoffs for the principal and the agent under this optimal contract:\n\nPrincipal's payoff for high effort = $18,000 - $6,000 = $12,000\nAgent's payoff for high effort = $18,000 - $6,000 - $6,000 = $6,000\n\nSo, under the optimal contract, the expected payoffs for the principal and the agent are $12,000 and $6,000, respectively."
