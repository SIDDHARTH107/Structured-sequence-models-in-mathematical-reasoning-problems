    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by the following formula:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the range -∞ to ∞.\n\nHowever, since the function f(t) = 2cos(3t) + 4sin(5t) is periodic, we can compute its Fourier series instead. The Fourier series of a periodic function is given by:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nω_0t) + b_n * sin(nω_0t)], where ω_0 is the fundamental frequency, and a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nFor the given function, we have:\n\na_0 = 0 (since there is no constant term)\na_n = 0 (since there are no other cosine terms except for the 2cos(3t) term)\nb_n = 0 (since there are no other sine terms except for the 4sin(5t) term)\n\nNow, we can identify the Fourier coefficients for the given function:\n\na_3 = 2 (corresponding to the 2cos(3t) term)\nb_5 = 4 (corresponding to the 4sin(5t) term)\n\nAll other a_n and b_n coefficients are 0.\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of the function f(t) = 2cos(3t) + 4sin(5t) over the range -π to π is:\n\nf(t) = 2cos(3t) + 4sin(5t)"
