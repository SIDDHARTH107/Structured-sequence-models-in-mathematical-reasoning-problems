    "message_2": "To find the frequency content of f(t), we need to analyze the given Fourier transform F(ω) = (4/π) [1/(1+ω^2)]. The frequency content can be determined by looking at the behavior of F(ω) as ω changes.\n\nAs ω approaches 0, F(ω) approaches (4/π), which means there is a significant DC (zero frequency) component in the signal. As ω increases, the magnitude of F(ω) decreases, which means the higher frequency components have smaller amplitudes. The function F(ω) has a behavior similar to that of a low-pass filter, where the lower frequencies have higher amplitudes and the higher frequencies have lower amplitudes.\n\nNow, to find the amplitude of the signal at t = 0, we need to compute the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω). The inverse Fourier transform of F(ω) is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫ F(ω) e^(jωt) dω\n\nWe know that F(ω) = (4/π) [1/(1+ω^2)]. The inverse Fourier transform of this function is a well-known result, and it is given by:\n\nf(t) = 2 e^(-|t|)\n\nNow, to find the amplitude of the signal at t = 0, we simply plug in t = 0 into the expression for f(t):\n\nf(0) = 2 e^(-|0|) = 2 e^0 = 2\n\nSo, the amplitude of the signal at t = 0 is 2."
