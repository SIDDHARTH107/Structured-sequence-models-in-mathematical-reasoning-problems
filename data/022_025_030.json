    "message_1": "A particle in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential with a frequency of $2\\pi \\times 10^{12}$ Hz is described by the Schrödinger equation. If the particle has an initial state given by the Gaussian wave function\n\n$$ \\psi(x,0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}}} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right), $$\n\nwhere $x_0 = 0$ m, $\\sigma = 10^{-10}$ m, and $\\hbar = 1.0546\\times 10^{-34}$ J$\\cdot$s, what is the probability density function $|\\psi(x, t)|^2$ of measuring the position of the particle at time $t = 10^{-13}$ s?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability density function $|\\psi(x, t)|^2$ at time $t = 10^{-13}$ s, we first need to find the time-dependent wave function $\\psi(x, t)$. Since the particle is in a harmonic oscillator potential, we can expand the initial Gaussian wave function in terms of the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator, which are the Hermite functions.\n\nThe time-dependent wave function can be written as:\n\n$$\\psi(x, t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n \\phi_n(x) e^{-i E_n t/\\hbar},$$\n\nwhere $c_n$ are the expansion coefficients, $\\phi_n(x)$ are the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator, and $E_n$ are the corresponding energy eigenvalues.\n\nTo find the expansion coefficients $c_n$, we need to project the initial wave function onto the eigenstates:\n\n$$c_n = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\phi_n^*(x) \\psi(x, 0) dx.$$\n\nHowever, calculating the coefficients $c_n$ and summing the series is a complex task that typically requires numerical methods.\n\nOnce we have the time-dependent wave function $\\psi(x, t)$, we can find the probability density function as:\n\n$$|\\psi(x, t)|^2 = |\\psi(x, 10^{-13}\\text{s})|^2 = |\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n \\phi_n(x) e^{-i E_n (10^{-13}\\text{s})/\\hbar}|^2.$$\n\nIn summary, to find the probability density function $|\\psi(x, t)|^2$ at time $t = 10^{-13}$ s, we need to expand the initial Gaussian wave function in terms of the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator, find the expansion coefficients $c_n$, and then compute the time-dependent wave function $\\psi(x, t)$. Finally, we can find the probability density function by taking the square of the absolute value of the time-dependent wave function. This process typically requires numerical methods to solve."
