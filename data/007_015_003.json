    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 50,000, we need to find the smallest n such that 2^n - 1 > 50,000 and M_n is prime.\n\nWe can start by finding the smallest n such that 2^n - 1 > 50,000:\n\n2^15 = 32,768\n2^16 = 65,536\n\nSo, n must be at least 16. However, 16 is not a prime number. The next prime number greater than 16 is 17. Let's check if M_17 is prime:\n\nM_17 = 2^17 - 1 = 131,071\n\n131,071 is a prime number. Therefore, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 50,000 is 131,071."
