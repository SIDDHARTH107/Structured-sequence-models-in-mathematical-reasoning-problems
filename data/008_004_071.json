    "message_2": "To solve the given system of homogeneous equations using matrix methods, we first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 3  2  1 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -1  4 | 0 ]\n[ 1 -3  2 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in its row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1 -3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -1  4 | 0 ]\n[ 3  2  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 2 * Row 1, and Row 3 with Row 3 - 3 * Row 1:\n\n```\n[ 1 -3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0  5  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0 11 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by 5:\n\n```\n[ 1 -3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0 11 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 + 3 * Row 2, and Row 3 with Row 3 - 11 * Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n5. Divide Row 3 by -5:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\n6. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - 2 * Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in its reduced row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = 0\ny = 0\nz = 0\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of homogeneous equations are x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
