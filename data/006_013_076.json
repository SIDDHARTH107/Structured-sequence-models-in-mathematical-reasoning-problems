    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a region, the probability of a flood occurring in a year is 0.05, the probability of a tornado occurring in a year is 0.03, and the probability of either a flood or a tornado occurring in a year is 0.07. What is the probability of neither a flood nor a tornado occurring in a year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nIn this case, A represents the event of a flood occurring, and B represents the event of a tornado occurring. We are given:\n\nP(A) = 0.05 (probability of a flood)\nP(B) = 0.03 (probability of a tornado)\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.07 (probability of either a flood or a tornado)\n\nWe can now solve for the probability of both events occurring, P(A ∩ B):\n\n0.07 = 0.05 + 0.03 - P(A ∩ B)\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.05 + 0.03 - 0.07\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.01\n\nNow, to find the probability of neither event occurring, we can use the complement rule:\n\nP(A' ∩ B') = 1 - P(A ∪ B)\n\nSince P(A ∪ B) = 0.07, we have:\n\nP(A' ∩ B') = 1 - 0.07\nP(A' ∩ B') = 0.93\n\nSo, the probability of neither a flood nor a tornado occurring in a year is 0.93."
