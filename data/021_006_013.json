Finally, compare your numerical solution with the exact solution of u(x,t).",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the Galerkin finite element method with linear elements, we first need to discretize the domain and define the basis functions. Let's divide the interval [0, 1] into N equal subintervals of length Δx = 1/N, and let x_i be the nodes of the mesh, where x_i = iΔx for i = 0, 1, ..., N.\n\nWe define the linear basis functions φ_i(x) as follows:\n\nφ_i(x) = (x - x_{i-1})/Δx for x ∈ [x_{i-1}, x_i]\nφ_i(x) = (x_{i+1} - x)/Δx for x ∈ [x_i, x_{i+1}]\nφ_i(x) = 0 otherwise\n\nNow, we approximate the solution u(x, t) as a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\nu(x, t) ≈ ∑_{i=1}^N c_i(t)φ_i(x)\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the given PDE and applying the Galerkin method, we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients c_i(t):\n\ndc_i/dt = k∑_{j=1}^N M_{ij}c_j(t)\n\nwhere M_{ij} = ∫_0^1 φ'_i(x)φ'_j(x) dx.\n\nWe can solve this system of ODEs using the forward Euler method with a time step of Δt = 0.01. The initial condition for the coefficients c_i(0) can be found by projecting the given initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(πx) onto the basis functions:\n\nc_i(0) = ∫_0^1 sin(πx)φ_i(x) dx.\n\nAfter solving for the coefficients c_i(t) at the desired time points t = 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0, we can compute the numerical solution u(x, t) as follows:\n\nu(x, t) ≈ ∑_{i=1}^N c_i(t)φ_i(x).\n\nNow, let's find the exact solution of the given PDE. Since the PDE is linear and homogeneous with homogeneous boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x)T(t), where X(x) and T(t) are functions of x and t, respectively. Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x)dT(t)/dt = kT(t)d^2X(x)/dx^2.\n\nDividing both sides by kXT, we obtain:\n\n(1/kT)dT/dt = (1/X)d^2X/dx^2.\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on t and the right-hand side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nd^2X/dx^2 = -λ^2X,\n(1/kT)dT/dt = -λ^2.\n\nThe general solution of the first ODE is X(x) = A sin(λx) + B cos(λx). Applying the boundary conditions u(0, t) = 0 and u(1, t) = 0, we get A = 0 and λ = nπ, where n is a positive integer. Thus, X(x) = B_n sin(nπx).\n\nThe general solution of the second ODE is T(t) = C_n exp(-kλ^2t). Therefore, the exact solution of the given PDE is:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ D_n sin(nπx) exp(-knπ^2t),\n\nwhere D_n = ∫_0^1 sin(πx) sin(nπx) dx.\n\nFinally, we can compare the numerical solution obtained using the Galerkin finite element method with the exact solution at the desired time points t = 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. Note that the accuracy of the numerical solution depends on the number of elements N and the time step Δt. To obtain a more accurate numerical solution, we can use a finer mesh and/or a smaller time step."
