    "message_1": "Consider the following nonlinear differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\sin(y) $$\n\nStarting from the initial condition $y(0)=\\pi/2$, what is the value of $y$ when $x=\\pi$ with an accuracy of $0.01$ using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method?",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we first need to determine the step size and the number of steps required to reach the desired accuracy. Let's denote the step size as $h$ and the number of steps as $n$. Since we want to find the value of $y$ at $x = \\pi$, we have:\n\n$$x = x_0 + nh$$\n$$\\pi = 0 + nh$$\n$$h = \\frac{\\pi}{n}$$\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. We have the following update formulas:\n\n$$k_1 = h \\cdot f(x_i, y_i)$$\n$$k_2 = h \\cdot f(x_i + \\frac{h}{2}, y_i + \\frac{k_1}{2})$$\n$$k_3 = h \\cdot f(x_i + \\frac{h}{2}, y_i + \\frac{k_2}{2})$$\n$$k_4 = h \\cdot f(x_i + h, y_i + k_3)$$\n\n$$y_{i+1} = y_i + \\frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)$$\n\nwhere $f(x, y) = \\sin(y)$.\n\nWe will start with a relatively small number of steps, say $n = 100$, and keep increasing it until we achieve the desired accuracy of $0.01$."
