    "message_2": "The function f(z) = cos(z) is an entire function, meaning it is analytic on the whole complex plane. This is because the cosine function can be represented by a power series that converges for all complex numbers z:\n\ncos(z) = Σ (-1)^n * (z^(2n)) / (2n)!, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nThis power series converges for all z in the complex plane, so the cosine function is analytic everywhere. Therefore, the largest connected open subset V of the plane on which f(z) = cos(z) has an analytic continuation is the entire complex plane, denoted as ℂ."
