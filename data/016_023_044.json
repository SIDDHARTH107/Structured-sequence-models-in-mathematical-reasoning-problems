    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal, also known as the Vicsek snowflake, is a self-similar fractal that can be constructed by dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the central square and the four corner squares, leaving only the four squares in the middle of the sides.\n\nTo find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, N = 4, as there are 4 remaining squares after each iteration. The scaling factor s is 3, as the original square is divided into 9 smaller squares (3x3 grid).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension D of the Vicsek fractal with side length 1 is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.26186\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with side length 1 is approximately 1.26186."
