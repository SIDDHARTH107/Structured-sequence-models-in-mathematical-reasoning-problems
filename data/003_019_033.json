    "message_2": "To find the integral of the function f(x) = 5cos(x) + 2sin(x) between the limits [0, π/2], we first need to find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe antiderivative of f(x) is:\n\nF(x) = ∫(5cos(x) + 2sin(x)) dx\n\nWe can find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\n∫(5cos(x)) dx = 5∫(cos(x)) dx = 5sin(x) + C₁\n\n∫(2sin(x)) dx = 2∫(sin(x)) dx = -2cos(x) + C₂\n\nNow, we can combine the antiderivatives:\n\nF(x) = 5sin(x) - 2cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate F(x) at the given limits:\n\nF(π/2) = 5sin(π/2) - 2cos(π/2) = 5(1) - 2(0) = 5\nF(0) = 5sin(0) - 2cos(0) = 5(0) - 2(1) = -2\n\nFinally, we find the definite integral by subtracting F(0) from F(π/2):\n\n∫(5cos(x) + 2sin(x)) dx from 0 to π/2 = F(π/2) - F(0) = 5 - (-2) = 7\n\nSo, the integral of the function f(x) = 5cos(x) + 2sin(x) between the limits [0, π/2] is 7."
