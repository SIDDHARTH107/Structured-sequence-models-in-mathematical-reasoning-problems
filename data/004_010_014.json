    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 5x^4 - 7x^2 + 3, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 5x^4 - 7x^2 + 3, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\n1. For the term 5x^4, the antiderivative is (5/5)(x^(4+1))/(4+1) = x^5.\n\n2. For the term -7x^2, the antiderivative is (-7/3)(x^(2+1))/(2+1) = -7x^3/3.\n\n3. For the constant term 3, the antiderivative is 3x (since the derivative of x is 1).\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^5 - (7/3)x^3 + 3x + C."
