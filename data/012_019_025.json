    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the given graph, we can use Vizing's theorem, which states that the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either its maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn this graph, the maximum degree Δ(G) is 3, as there are vertices with 3 edges connected to them. Now, we need to check if we can color the edges using 3 colors or if we need to use 4 colors.\n\nLet's try to color the edges using 3 colors:\n\n1. Color the top horizontal edge with color 1.\n2. Color the left diagonal edge with color 2.\n3. Color the right diagonal edge with color 3.\n4. Color the bottom horizontal edge with color 1.\n5. Color the left vertical edge with color 3.\n6. Color the right vertical edge with color 2.\n\nWe have successfully colored all the edges using 3 colors without any adjacent edges having the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the given graph is 3."
