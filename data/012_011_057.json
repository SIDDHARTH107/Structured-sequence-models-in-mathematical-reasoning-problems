A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G:\n\n```\n     1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4\n     |         |     \n     5         6     \n     |         |     \n     7         8     \n```\n\nCut vertices:\n1. Vertex 2: If we remove vertex 2, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 5, 7} and {3, 4, 6, 8}.\n2. Vertex 3: If we remove vertex 3, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 5, 7} and {4, 6, 8}.\n\nBridges:\n1.
