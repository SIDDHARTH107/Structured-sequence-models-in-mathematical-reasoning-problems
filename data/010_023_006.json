    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of times a knot with 8 crossings must intersect itself to become an unknotted loop, we can use the concept of knot unknotting number.\n\nThe unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of times it must be passed through itself to untangle it into an unknotted loop. For a knot with n crossings, the unknotting number can be estimated using the inequality:\n\nUnknotting number ≥ (Crossing number - 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, the knot has 8 crossings, so the inequality becomes:\n\nUnknotting number ≥ (8 - 1) / 2\nUnknotting number ≥ 7 / 2\n\nSince the unknotting number must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nUnknotting number ≥ 4\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of times this knot with 8 crossings must intersect itself to become an unknotted loop is 4 times."
