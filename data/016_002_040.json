    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is created by iteratively adding smaller equilateral triangles to each side of the initial equilateral triangle. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (Initial Line Segment Length) * (3 * (4/3)^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial line segment length is 4 units, and we want to find the perimeter after 4 iterations (n = 4). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (3 * (4/3)^4)\nPerimeter = 4 * (3 * (256/81))\nPerimeter = 4 * (768/81)\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake after 4 iterations is (3072/81) units."
