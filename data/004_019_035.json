    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at time t = 4, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position function s(t).\n\nThe first derivative of s(t) with respect to t represents the velocity function, v(t):\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(2t^2 - 4t + 6)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = 4t - 4\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at t = 4:\n\nv(4) = 4(4) - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12\n\nThe second derivative of s(t) with respect to t represents the acceleration function, a(t):\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(4t - 4)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 4\n\nSince the acceleration function is a constant, the acceleration at t = 4 is:\n\na(4) = 4\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at time t = 4 is 12, and the acceleration is 4."
