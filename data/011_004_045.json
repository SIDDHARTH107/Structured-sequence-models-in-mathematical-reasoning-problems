    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MISSISSIPPI\", we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset:\n\nNumber of arrangements = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of letters, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the counts of each distinct letter.\n\nIn this case, n = 11 (total number of letters), n1 = 4 (number of S's), n2 = 4 (number of I's), n3 = 2 (number of P's), and n4 = 1 (number of M's).\n\nSo the number of distinct arrangements is:\n\n11! / (4! * 4! * 2! * 1!) = 39,916,800 / (24 * 24 * 2 * 1) = 34,650"
