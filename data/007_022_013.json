Alice's secret key is 5 and her public key is (7, 13), while Bob's secret key is 8 and his public key is (20, 6). Find the shared secret key.",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, we will use the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol. \n\nFirst, let's recall the curve equation and the field prime:\nCurve equation: y^2 = x^3 + 7\nField prime: p = 23\n\nAlice's secret key (a): 5\nAlice's public key (A): (7, 13)\n\nBob's secret key (b): 8\nBob's public key (B): (20, 6)\n\nNow, we need to compute the shared secret key by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Alice computes the shared secret key by multiplying her secret key (a) with Bob's public key (B): a * B\n2. Bob computes the shared secret key by multiplying his secret key (b) with Alice's public key (A): b * A\n\nSince both operations should result in the same point on the elliptic curve, we only need to compute one of them. Let's compute Alice's operation (a * B):\n\na * B = 5 * (20, 6)\n\nTo perform the scalar multiplication, we can use the double-and-add algorithm. We will represent the binary form of Alice's secret key (5) as 101. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Initialize a variable R to the point at infinity (neutral element on the elliptic curve).\n2. For each bit in the binary representation of Alice's secret key (from left to right):\n   a. Double the point R.\n   b. If the current bit is 1, add the point B to R.\n\nLet's perform the double-and-add algorithm:\n\n1. R = point at infinity\n2. First bit (1): Double R and add B\n   a. R = 2 * point at infinity = point at infinity\n   b. R = point at infinity + B = B = (20, 6)\n3. Second bit (0): Double R\n   a. R = 2 * (20, 6) = (9, 16)\n4. Third bit (1): Double R and add B\n   a. R = 2 * (9, 16) = (17, 20)\n   b. R = (17, 20) + (20, 6) = (14, 19)\n\nThe result of the scalar multiplication is the point (14, 19). This is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob have computed."
