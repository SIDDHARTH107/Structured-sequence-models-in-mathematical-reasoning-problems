    "message_1": "A two-player game is played by player A and player B, where each player selects either \"1\" or \"2\". If both players choose the same number, Player A wins and gets a payoff of $5. If they choose different numbers, Player B wins and gets a payoff of $3. If Player A can see what number Player B has chosen before selecting their own number, what is the optimal strategy for Player A to maximize their expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "Since Player A can see what number Player B has chosen before selecting their own number, the optimal strategy for Player A is to always choose the same number as Player B. This way, Player A will always win and get a payoff of $5. There is no need for Player A to choose a different number, as doing so would result in a loss and a payoff of $0. By always choosing the same number as Player B, Player A maximizes their expected payoff to $5 per game."
