    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean GPA of all students at the university, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 3.2, the standard deviation is 0.4, and the sample size is 50. First, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 0.4 / √(50) ≈ 0.0566\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 3.2 ± (1.96 * 0.0566)\n\nLower Bound = 3.2 - (1.96 * 0.0566) ≈ 3.089\nUpper Bound = 3.2 + (1.96 * 0.0566) ≈ 3.311\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean GPA of all students at the university is approximately (3.089, 3.311)."
