    "message_2": "To find the distinct non-abelian groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow p-subgroups, n_p, must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups (p = 2):\nn_2 must divide 48 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups (p = 3):\nn_3 must divide 48 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups and their corresponding groups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1:\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Both are normal, and the group is a direct product of these subgroups. Since the orders of the subgroups are coprime, the group is isomorphic to Z_16 x Z_3, which is an abelian group.\n\n2. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1:\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_16 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_3. There are two distinct non-abelian groups in this case, corresponding to the two non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_3 to Aut(Z_16 x Z_2) = Z_8 x Z_2.\n\n3. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4:\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the form Z_16 x Z_3 ⋊ Z_2. However, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_2 to Aut(Z_16 x Z_3) = Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, so there are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4:\nIn this case, both Sylow subgroups have more than one member, and neither is normal. There are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two distinct non-abelian groups of order 48, and their isomorphism classes are (Z_16 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_3 with two different non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_3 to Aut(Z_16 x Z_2) = Z_8 x Z_2."
