    "message_2": "To form a team of 4 people from 8 employees, we can use the binomial coefficient formula, which is also known as \"n choose k\" or C(n, k):\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (total number of employees) and k = 4 (number of people to be selected for the team).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8, 4) = (1680) / (24)\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo, there are 70 different ways to select a team of 4 people from 8 employees."
