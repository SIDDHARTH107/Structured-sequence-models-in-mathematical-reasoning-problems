    "message_2": "Since A and B have no common elements, their intersection A ∩ B is an empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of the empty set with C, which is (∅ x C). The Cartesian product of an empty set with any set is always an empty set. Therefore, (∅ x C) = ∅."
