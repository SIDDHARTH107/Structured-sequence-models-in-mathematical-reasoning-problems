    "message_1": "A clothing manufacturer wants to identify the factors that affect the purchasing decisions of its customers. They surveyed 500 customers, and based on their responses, conducted a factor analysis to identify the underlying factors. The results showed that three factors explained 60% of the variance in the purchasing decisions. \n\nWhat is the proportion of total variance in purchasing decisions that is explained by each of these three factors?",
    "message_2": "The information provided does not give the individual proportions of variance explained by each of the three factors. However, we know that the three factors combined explain 60% of the total variance in purchasing decisions. \n\nTo find the proportion of total variance explained by each factor, we would need more information about the individual contributions of each factor."
