The distances between the locations are given in the table below. What is the optimal route for the truck to take in order to minimize the total distance traveled?\"\n\n| Destination | A | B | C | D | E |\n| ---         | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A (km)      | - | 10 | 8 | 12 | 14 |\n| B (km)      | 10 | - | 6 | 4 | 10 |\n| C (km)      | 8 | 6 | - | 15 | 8 |\n| D (km)      | 12 | 4 | 15 | - | 6 |\n| E (km)      | 14 | 10 | 8 | 6 | - |",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for all possible routes and then selecting the one with the minimum distance. Since there are 5 locations, there are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible routes. However, since the route is a round trip, we can divide this number by 2, which gives us 60 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the 10 unique routes starting from each location (A, B, C, D, E) and their total distances:\n\n1.
