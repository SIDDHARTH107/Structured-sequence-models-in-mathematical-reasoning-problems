    "message_2": "To verify that the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B) is a superset of both sets A and B, we need to show that every element in sets A and B is also an element of the union A ∪ B.\n\nFirst, let's find the union of sets A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in set A is also in A ∪ B:\n\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n8 ∈ A and 8 ∈ A ∪ B\n10 ∈ A and 10 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set A are also in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNext, let's check if every element in set B is also in A ∪ B:\n\n1 ∈ B and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ B and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n7 ∈ B and 7 ∈ A ∪ B\n9 ∈ B and 9 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set B are also in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have verified that the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B) is a superset of both sets A and B."
