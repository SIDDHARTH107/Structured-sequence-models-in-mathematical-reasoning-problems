    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $y$ in both equations equal:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n6x + 9y -3iz = 3+3i \\\\\n6x -4y +8iz = -4-6i\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $y$:\n\n$$\n(6x - 4y + 8iz) - (6x + 9y - 3iz) = (-4 - 6i) - (3 + 3i)\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n-13y + 11iz = -7 - 9i\n$$\n\nNow, let's solve for $y$ in terms of $z$:\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{11iz + 7 + 9i}{13}\n$$\n\nNext, substitute this expression for $y$ back into the first equation:\n\n$$\n2x + 3\\left(\\frac{11iz + 7 + 9i}{13}\\right) - iz = 1 + i\n$$\n\nNow, let's solve for $x$ in terms of $z$:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{1 + i - 3(7 + 9i)/13 + iz}{2}\n$$\n\nNow, we have expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$. Since there are infinitely many solutions for $z$, we can express the general solution for this system of linear equations as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx = \\frac{1 + i - 3(7 + 9i)/13 + iz}{2} \\\\\ny = \\frac{11iz + 7 + 9i}{13}\n\\end{cases}\n$$"
