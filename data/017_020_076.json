    "message_1": "Consider a group of order 40. How many non-abelian groups of order 40 are there? Can you determine which of the non-abelian groups of order 40 the given group is isomorphic to?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 40, we first need to find all possible groups of order 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nn(40) = n(2^3) * n(5)\n\nSince there are two groups of order 8 (2^3) and one group of order 5, we have:\n\nn(40) = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nThese two groups are the direct product of the groups of order 8 and 5, which are:\n\n1. Z_8 × Z_5 (Abelian)\n2. D_4 × Z_5 (Non-abelian)\n\nSo, there is only one non-abelian group of order 40, which is the direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 (D_4) and the cyclic group of order 5 (Z_5). The given group must be isomorphic to D_4 × Z_5."
