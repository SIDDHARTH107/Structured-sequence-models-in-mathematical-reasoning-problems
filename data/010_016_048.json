    "message_2": "Since M is a closed orientable 3-dimensional manifold, we know that its Poincaré dual is also a closed orientable 3-dimensional manifold. Let's denote the Poincaré dual of M as M*.\n\nNow, given the Betti numbers B_0(M) = 1, B_1(M) = 0, B_2(M) = 1, and B_3(M) = 1, we can compute the Betti numbers of M* using Poincaré duality:\n\nB_0(M*) = B_3(M) = 1\nB_1(M*) = B_2(M) = 1\nB_2(M*) = B_1(M) = 0\nB_3(M*) = B_0(M) = 1\n\nNow, let α be a non-zero homology class in H^1(M; ℤ/2ℤ). Then, α is also a cohomology class in H^1(M*; ℤ/2ℤ). We want to compute the self-intersection number of α, which is given by the cup product of α with itself:\n\nα ∪ α ∈ H^2(M*; ℤ/2ℤ)\n\nHowever, since B_2(M*) = 0, we know that H^2(M*; ℤ/2ℤ) is trivial. Therefore, the cup product α ∪ α must be zero:\n\nα ∪ α = 0\n\nSo, the self-intersection number for a non-zero homology class α in H^1(M; ℤ/2ℤ) is 0."
