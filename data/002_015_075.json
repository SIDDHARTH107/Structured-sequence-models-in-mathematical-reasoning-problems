    "message_2": "The perimeter (or circumference) of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(5 cm)\nC = 10π cm\n\nThe exact perimeter of the circle is 10π cm."
