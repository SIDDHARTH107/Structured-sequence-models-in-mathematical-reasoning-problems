    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, we can try to find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's label the vertices as V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, and V8.\n\nWe can start with vertex V1 and try to find a Hamiltonian cycle:\n\n1. Start at V1, and move to V2 (since V1 is connected to V2 and V3, but V3 is connected to V5 which has a higher degree, so we choose V2).\n2. From V2, move to V4 (since V2 is connected to V1, V3, V4, and V5, but we've already visited V1, and V3 and V5 have higher degrees).\n3. From V4, move to V7 (since V4 is connected to V2, V5, and V7, but we've already visited V2, and V5 has a higher degree).\n4. From V7, move to V8 (since V7 is connected to V4, V5, and V8, but we've already visited V4, and V5 has a higher degree).\n5. From V8, move to V6 (since V8 is connected to V5, V6, and V7, but we've already visited V7, and V5 has a higher degree).\n6. From V6, move to V3 (since V6 is connected to V3, V5, and V8, but we've already visited V8, and V5 has a higher degree).\n7. From V3, move to V5 (since V3 is connected to V1, V2, V5, and V6, but we've already visited V1, V2, and V6).\n8. From V5, we can return to V1 (since V5 is connected to V1, V2, V3, V4, V6, V7, and V8, but we've already visited V2, V3, V4, V6, V7, and V8).\n\nSo, we have found a Hamiltonian cycle in graph G: V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> V7 -> V8 -> V6 -> V3 -> V5 -> V1."
