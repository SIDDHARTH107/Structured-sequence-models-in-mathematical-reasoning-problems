    "message_1": "Let X be the unit sphere in R^3 with the standard Euclidean metric. Suppose f: X -> R is a Morse function with exactly two critical points. If the value of f at the local maximum is 3 and the value of f at the local minimum is -2, what is the value of f at the other critical point?",
    "message_2": "There seems to be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. A Morse function with exactly two critical points must have one local minimum and one local maximum. Since the problem already states that there is a local maximum with a value of 3 and a local minimum with a value of -2, there is no \"other\" critical point. The Morse function has only these two critical points."
