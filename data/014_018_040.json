    "message_1": "Suppose a message is encrypted using a substitution cipher where each letter is substituted with another letter from the English alphabet. If the letter 'e' is substituted with 'h', how many possible ways can the rest of the letters be substituted?",
    "message_2": "Since 'e' is already substituted with 'h', we have 25 remaining letters in the English alphabet to substitute. For the first letter, we have 24 choices (since 'h' is already used), for the second letter, we have 23 choices, for the third letter, 22 choices, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to substitute the rest of the letters is:\n\n24 * 23 * 22 * ... * 1 = 24!\n\nTherefore, there are 24! (24 factorial) ways to substitute the rest of the letters, which is equal to 62,204,823,564,856,000."
