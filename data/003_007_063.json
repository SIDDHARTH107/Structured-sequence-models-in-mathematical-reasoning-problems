    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for you to solve:\n\nIn triangle ABC, angle A measures 60 degrees, side AB measures 8 units, and side BC measures 10 units. Use the law of cosines to find the length of side AC.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of side AC, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have angle A = 60 degrees, side AB = 8 units (side a), and side BC = 10 units (side b). We want to find the length of side AC (side c). We can plug these values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(60)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 60 degrees. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nc² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * (1/2)\n\nNow, we can simplify and solve for c:\n\nc² = 64 + 100 - 80\nc² = 164 - 80\nc² = 84\n\nTo find the length of side AC (c), we take the square root of 84:\n\nc = √84 ≈ 9.165\n\nSo, the length of side AC is approximately 9.165 units."
