Find the temperature distribution along the length of the pipe using Fourier transform. (Assume the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of steel as 50 W/mK and 500 J/kgK respectively).",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the length of the pipe, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the pipe, and α is the thermal diffusivity. The thermal diffusivity is given by:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat capacity. For steel, we have k = 50 W/mK and c = 500 J/kgK. The density of steel is approximately 7850 kg/m³. Therefore, the thermal diffusivity is:\n\nα = 50 / (7850 * 500) = 1.28 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s\n\nNow, we need to solve the heat equation with the given boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = 0°C\nT(2, t) = 80°C\n\nTo solve this problem using Fourier transform, we first need to find the steady-state solution, which is the temperature distribution when the system reaches equilibrium. The steady-state solution is given by:\n\nT_ss(x) = A * x + B\n\nwhere A and B are constants. Applying the boundary conditions:\n\nT_ss(0) = B = 0°C\nT_ss(2) = 2 * A = 80°C\n\nSolving for A, we get:\n\nA = 40°C/m\n\nSo, the steady-state solution is:\n\nT_ss(x) = 40 * x\n\nNow, we need to find the transient solution, which is the difference between the actual temperature and the steady-state temperature:\n\nT_tr(x, t) = T(x, t) - T_ss(x)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n∂T_tr/∂t = α ∂²T_tr/∂x²\n\nThe boundary conditions for the transient solution are:\n\nT_tr(0, t) = -40 * 0 = 0°C\nT_tr(2, t) = 80 - 40 * 2 = 0°C\n\nTo solve this equation using Fourier transform, we first take the Fourier sine transform of both sides:\n\n∂T̂_tr/∂t = α * (-1) * n² * π² * T̂_tr\n\nwhere T̂_tr is the Fourier sine transform of T_tr, and n is the mode number. This is a first-order ordinary differential equation, which can be solved using separation of variables:\n\n∫(dT̂_tr / T̂_tr) = -α * n² * π² * ∫dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(T̂_tr) = -α * n² * π² * t + C\n\nwhere C is the integration constant. Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:\n\nT̂_tr = K * exp(-α * n² * π² * t)\n\nwhere K = exp(C) is another constant. To find K, we need to take the inverse Fourier sine transform of T̂_tr and apply the initial condition T_tr(x, 0) = -40 * x:\n\n-40 * x = Σ(K_n * sin(n * π * x))\n\nTo find the coefficients K_n, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nK_n = 2 * ∫(0 to 2)(-40 * x * sin(n * π * x) dx)\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nK_n = -80 * (-1)^(n+1) / (n * π)\n\nNow, we can write the transient solution as:\n\nT_tr(x, t) = -80 * Σ((-1)^(n+1) * sin(n * π * x) * exp(-α * n² * π² * t) / (n * π))\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution along the length of the pipe is given by the sum of the steady-state and transient solutions:\n\nT(x, t) = T_ss(x) + T_tr(x, t)\nT(x, t) = 40 * x - 80 * Σ((-1)^(n+1) * sin(n * π * x) * exp(-α * n² * π² * t) / (n * π))\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution along the length of the pipe at any time t."
