    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinct colorings of an object, up to symmetry, is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry operation.\n\nIn this case, we have a square with 4 vertices, and we can rotate it by 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. Let's consider each rotation:\n\n1. 0° rotation (identity): All 4^4 = 256 colorings are fixed, as no vertices change position.\n\n2. 90° rotation: A 90° rotation swaps the positions of all 4 vertices. For a coloring to be fixed by this rotation, all 4 vertices must have the same color. There are 4 choices for this color, so there are 4 fixed colorings.\n\n3. 180° rotation: A 180° rotation swaps the positions of opposite vertices. For a coloring to be fixed by this rotation, the opposite vertices must have the same color. There are 4 choices for the color of one pair of opposite vertices and 4 choices for the other pair, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 fixed colorings.\n\n4. 270° rotation: This is the same as the 90° rotation, so there are 4 fixed colorings.\n\nNow, we can use Burnside's Lemma to find the number of distinct colorings:\n\n(Number of fixed colorings) / (Number of rotations) = (256 + 4 + 16 + 4) / 4 = 280 / 4 = 70\n\nSo, there are 70 distinct ways to color the vertices of a square, up to rotation, with 4 colors."
