    "message_1": "A metal rectangular sheet measuring 30 cm by 20 cm is to be cut at the corners and folded to form an open-top box. What should be the size of the cutout so that the volume of the box is maximum?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the size of the square cutout at each corner. After cutting and folding, the dimensions of the open-top box will be:\n\nLength = 30 - 2x\nWidth = 20 - 2x\nHeight = x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be calculated as:\n\nV = Length × Width × Height\nV = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the volume function with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\ndV/dx = 0\n\nFirst, expand the volume function:\n\nV = 4x^3 - 100x^2 + 600x\n\nNow, find the first derivative:\n\ndV/dx = 12x^2 - 200x + 600\n\nSet the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n12x^2 - 200x + 600 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 4:\n\n3x^2 - 50x + 150 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -50, and c = 150:\n\nx = (50 ± √((-50)^2 - 4(3)(150))) / (2(3))\nx = (50 ± √(2500 - 1800)) / 6\nx = (50 ± √700) / 6\n\nThere are two possible values for x:\n\nx1 = (50 + √700) / 6 ≈ 5.42\nx2 = (50 - √700) / 6 ≈ 9.25\n\nHowever, since the width of the sheet is 20 cm, the maximum possible value for x is 20/2 = 10 cm. Therefore, x2 = 9.25 cm is not a valid solution as it would result in a negative width for the box. Thus, the size of the cutout that maximizes the volume of the box is approximately x1 = 5.42 cm."
