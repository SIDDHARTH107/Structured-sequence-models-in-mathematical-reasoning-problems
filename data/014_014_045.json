    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"mathematics is fun\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key \"CRYPTO\":\n   C R Y P T\n   O A B D E\n   F G H I K\n   L M N S U\n   V W X Z Q\n\nNote that the letter J is not included in the matrix, and I and J are considered the same. Also, the remaining letters of the alphabet are filled in the matrix in alphabetical order, excluding the letters already used in the key.\n\n2. Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an X between them. If the plaintext has an odd number of letters, add an X at the end:\n   MA TH EM AT IC SX IS FU NX\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\nMA -> YD\nTH -> FS\nEM -> YK\nAT -> TO\nIC -> KS\nSX -> ZA\nIS -> UH\nFU -> CG\nNX -> ZM\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the ciphertext:\n   YD FS YK TO KS ZA UH CG ZM\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\" is \"YDFSYKTOKSZAUHCGZM\"."
