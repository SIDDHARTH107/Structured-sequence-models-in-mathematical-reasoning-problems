    "message_1": "A factory produces car parts, and the weights of the parts are normally distributed with a mean of 500 grams and a standard deviation of 10 grams. However, there are some defective parts that weigh less than the mean. To identify these defective parts, the factory decides to use the 20th percentile as the cutoff weight.\n\nWhat is the weight that separates the defective parts from the non-defective ones?",
    "message_2": "To find the weight that separates the defective parts from the non-defective ones, we need to find the 20th percentile of the normal distribution with a mean of 500 grams and a standard deviation of 10 grams.\n\nWe can use the z-score formula to find the value corresponding to the 20th percentile:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\n\nWhere z is the z-score, x is the value we want to find, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 20th percentile. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find this value. The z-score for the 20th percentile is approximately -0.84.\n\nNow, we can plug this z-score and the given mean and standard deviation into the z-score formula and solve for x:\n\n-0.84 = (x - 500) / 10\n\n-0.84 * 10 = x - 500\n\n-8.4 = x - 500\n\nx = 491.6\n\nSo, the weight that separates the defective parts from the non-defective ones is approximately 491.6 grams."
