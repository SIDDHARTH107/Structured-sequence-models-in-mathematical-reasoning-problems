    "message_2": "To simplify the expression cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) when x is equal to 45 degrees, we first need to find the values of cos(45) and sin(45).\n\nFor a 45-degree angle in a right triangle, both the adjacent and opposite sides are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of the other two sides. Therefore, we can find the values of cos(45) and sin(45) as follows:\n\ncos(45) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = 1 / √2 = √2 / 2\nsin(45) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 1 / √2 = √2 / 2\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the expression:\n\ncos^2(45) - sin^2(45) = (√2 / 2)^2 - (√2 / 2)^2\n\n= (2 / 4) - (2 / 4)\n\n= 0\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 0."
