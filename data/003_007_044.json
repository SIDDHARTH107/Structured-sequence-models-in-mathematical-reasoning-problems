    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a = 10, b = 12, and c = 15. We want to find the largest angle, which is the angle opposite the longest side (c = 15). Let's call this angle C.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c:\n\ncos(C) = (10^2 + 12^2 - 15^2) / (2 * 10 * 12)\ncos(C) = (100 + 144 - 225) / 240\ncos(C) = (19) / 240\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(19/240)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nC ≈ 81.79°\n\nSo, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 81.79 degrees."
