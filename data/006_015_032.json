The probability of an attack of type A occurring on any given day is 0.2, while the probability of an attack of type B occurring is 0.3. Find the probability that the network will experience at least one cyber attack per day.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one cyber attack per day, we can first find the probability of no cyber attacks occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's denote the events as follows:\n- A: Attack of type A occurs\n- B: Attack of type B occurs\n- A': No attack of type A occurs\n- B': No attack of type B occurs\n\nWe are given the probabilities of attacks A and B occurring:\nP(A) = 0.2\nP(B) = 0.3\n\nWe can find the probabilities of no attacks A and B occurring:\nP(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\nP(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of both A' and B' occurring (i.e., no attacks of either type). We will assume that the two types of attacks are independent events. In that case, the probability of both A' and B' occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(A' and B') = P(A') * P(B') = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56\n\nFinally, we find the probability of at least one attack occurring by subtracting the probability of no attacks from 1:\n\nP(At least one attack) = 1 - P(A' and B') = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44\n\nSo, the probability that the network will experience at least one cyber attack per day is 0.44."
