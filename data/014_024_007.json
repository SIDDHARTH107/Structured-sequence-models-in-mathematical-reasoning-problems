    "message_2": "To decrypt the message \"QLIITMVL\" using the Caesar cipher with a key of 5, we need to shift each letter 5 positions back in the alphabet.\n\nQ -> L (shift back 5 positions)\nL -> G (shift back 5 positions)\nI -> D (shift back 5 positions)\nI -> D (shift back 5 positions)\nT -> O (shift back 5 positions)\nM -> H (shift back 5 positions)\nV -> S (shift back 5 positions)\nL -> G (shift back 5 positions)\n\nSo, the original message is \"LDDOHSG\"."
