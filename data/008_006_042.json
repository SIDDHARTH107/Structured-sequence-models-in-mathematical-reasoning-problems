Then, to find the eigenvectors v corresponding to each eigenvalue λ, solve the equation (A - λI)v = 0.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the eigenvalues λ by solving the equation det(A - λI) = 0.\n\nA - λI = [[3 - λ, 2], [4, 1 - λ]]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n(3 - λ)(1 - λ) - (2)(4) = λ^2 - 4λ - 5\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation λ^2 - 4λ - 5 = 0. Factoring, we get (λ - 5)(λ + 1) = 0. So, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 5 and λ2 = -1.\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 5:\n\n(A - λ1I)v = (A - 5I)v = [[-2, 2], [4, -4]]v = 0\n\nWe can see that the first and second rows are linearly dependent. We can use the first row to find the eigenvector:\n\n-2x + 2y = 0 => x = y\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 5 is v1 = [1, 1] (or any scalar multiple of this vector).\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n\n(A - λ2I)v = (A + I)v = [[4, 2], [4, 2]]v = 0\n\nAgain, the first and second rows are linearly dependent. We can use the first row to find the eigenvector:\n\n4x + 2y = 0 => y = -2x\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = -1 is v2 = [1, -2] (or any scalar multiple of this vector).\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 5 and λ2 = -1, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [1, 1] and v2 = [1, -2]."
