    "message_1": "A man standing on the ground sees the top of a building at an angle of elevation of 45 degrees. He moves 20 meters closer to the building and now sees the top at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the building as h meters and the initial distance between the man and the building as x meters. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the height and distance.\n\nFrom the first observation (45 degrees angle of elevation), we have:\n\ntan(45) = h/x\n1 = h/x (since tan(45) = 1)\nh = x\n\nFrom the second observation (60 degrees angle of elevation), the man is now 20 meters closer to the building, so the distance is (x-20) meters:\n\ntan(60) = h/(x-20)\n√3 = h/(x-20) (since tan(60) = √3)\n\nNow we can substitute h with x (from the first equation):\n\n√3 = x/(x-20)\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x-20):\n\n√3(x-20) = x\n\nNow, distribute √3:\n\n√3x - 20√3 = x\n\nMove x to the left side of the equation:\n\n√3x - x = 20√3\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(√3 - 1) = 20√3\n\nNow, divide both sides by (√3 - 1):\n\nx = 20√3 / (√3 - 1)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate (√3 + 1):\n\nx = (20√3(√3 + 1)) / ((√3 - 1)(√3 + 1))\n\nx = (20√3(√3 + 1)) / (3 - 1)\n\nx = (20√3(√3 + 1)) / 2\n\nx = 10√3(√3 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the height of the building (h = x):\n\nh = 10√3(√3 + 1)\n\nh = 10(3 + √3)\n\nh = 30 + 10√3\n\nSo, the height of the building is (30 + 10√3) meters."
