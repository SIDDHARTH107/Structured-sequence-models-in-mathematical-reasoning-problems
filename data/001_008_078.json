    "message_2": "To find the slope of the line passing through the points (-2, 4) and (3, 7), we can use the formula:\n\nslope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (-2, 4) and (x2, y2) = (3, 7).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nm = (7 - 4) / (3 - (-2))\nm = 3 / 5\n\nThe slope of the line passing through the points (-2, 4) and (3, 7) is 3/5."
