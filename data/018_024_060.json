    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A ∆ B, denoted as (A ∆ B)'. Since we are not given a universal set, we will assume the universal set U is the union of A and B, which is {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 4} = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (A ∆ B)', denoted as (A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∆ B)'.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∆ B)' = ({1, 4} ∪ {2, 3}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {2, 3}) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the complement of A and B, denoted as A' and B'.\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 2, 3} = {4}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 4} = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B', denoted as A' ∆ B'.\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B') = ({4} ∪ {1}) - ({4} ∩ {1}) = {1, 4} - {} = {1, 4}\n\nFinally, we can compare the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (A ∆ B)' with the symmetric difference of A' and B'.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∆ B)' = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nSince {1, 2, 3, 4} ≠ {1, 4}, the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (A ∆ B)' is not equal to the symmetric difference of A' and B'."
