    "message_1": "In Dictator Game, Player 1 is given $10 and decides how much money to give Player 2, keeping the rest for himself. If Player 2 accepts the offer, both keep the money as given. But if Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. If Player 1 assumes that Player 2 always accepts any offer greater than $2, how much money should Player 1 give to Player 2 to maximize his own profit?",
    "message_2": "If Player 1 assumes that Player 2 will always accept any offer greater than $2, then Player 1 should give Player 2 exactly $2. This way, Player 1 maximizes his own profit by keeping $8 for himself ($10 - $2 = $8), while still ensuring that Player 2 accepts the offer."
