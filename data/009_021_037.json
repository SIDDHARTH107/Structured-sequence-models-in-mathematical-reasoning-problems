    "message_1": "Consider a two-dimensional image with pixel values given by the function u(x,y), where x and y denote the pixel coordinates. Suppose that u satisfies the following partial differential equation: \n\n∂u/∂t + 5∂u/∂x - 3∂u/∂y = 0\n\nwith initial condition u(x,y,0) = 2x^2 - 3xy + 4y^2.\n\nDetermine the solution u(x,y,t) to the given partial differential equation for t > 0 satisfying the initial condition.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations for this PDE are:\n\ndx/dt = 5\ndy/dt = -3\ndu/dt = 0\n\nWe can solve these ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to find x(t), y(t), and u(t). \n\nFor dx/dt = 5, we have:\n\nx(t) = 5t + x0\n\nFor dy/dt = -3, we have:\n\ny(t) = -3t + y0\n\nSince du/dt = 0, u(t) remains constant along the characteristic curves:\n\nu(t) = u(x0, y0)\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between (x0, y0) and (x, y). From the initial condition, we have:\n\nu(x0, y0) = 2x0^2 - 3x0y0 + 4y0^2\n\nWe can substitute x0 and y0 from the characteristic equations:\n\nx0 = x - 5t\ny0 = y + 3t\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the initial condition equation:\n\nu(x - 5t, y + 3t) = 2(x - 5t)^2 - 3(x - 5t)(y + 3t) + 4(y + 3t)^2\n\nNow, we have the solution u(x, y, t) for the given PDE:\n\nu(x, y, t) = 2(x - 5t)^2 - 3(x - 5t)(y + 3t) + 4(y + 3t)^2"
