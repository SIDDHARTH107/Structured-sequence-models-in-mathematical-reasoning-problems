    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider a closed loop in 3-dimensional space that is in the form of a trefoil knot. Using the tools of geometric topology and knot theory, determine the minimum number of times this loop must be crossed to transform it into an unknotted loop.",
    "message_2": "In knot theory, the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot. To determine the minimum number of times the loop must be crossed to transform it into an unknotted loop, we can use the concept of \"crossing number.\"\n\nThe crossing number of a knot is the smallest number of crossings in any diagram of the knot. For the trefoil knot, the crossing number is 3. This means that the loop must be crossed a minimum of 3 times to transform it into an unknotted loop."
