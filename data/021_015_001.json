    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot run the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in real-time. However, I can provide you with a general outline of how to implement the PSO algorithm to solve the given optimization problem.\n\n1. Initialize the PSO parameters:\n- Number of particles (e.g., 50)\n- Number of iterations (e.g., 1000)\n- Cognitive and social coefficients (e.g., c1 = 2, c2 = 2)\n- Inertia weight (e.g., w = 0.9, decreasing linearly over iterations)\n- Search space bounds: [-20, 20]\n\n2. Initialize the particle positions and velocities randomly within the search space.\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each particle using the objective function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 36x + 1.\n\n4. Set the initial personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) positions to the initial positions of the particles.\n\n5. Iterate through the following steps until the maximum number of iterations is reached:\n   a. Update the particle velocities using the following formula:\n      v_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * rand() * (pbest_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * rand() * (gbest - x_i(t))\n   b. Update the particle positions using the updated velocities:\n      x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n   c. Evaluate the fitness of each particle using the objective function.\n   d. Update the pbest and gbest positions if a better solution is found.\n   e. Update the inertia weight (if using a decreasing strategy).\n\n6. The gbest position represents the optimal solution, and the minimum value of f(x) can be obtained by evaluating the objective function at this position.\n\nTo implement the PSO algorithm, you can use a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or R. There are also libraries available for these languages that can help you implement the PSO algorithm more easily, such as PySwarms for Python or the Global Optimization Toolbox for MATLAB."
