    "message_2": "To find the complex derivative of the function f(z) = 2z + i, we can treat z as a complex variable and differentiate with respect to it. In this case, the function is a simple linear function, so the derivative will be constant throughout the complex plane.\n\nThe derivative of f(z) with respect to z is:\n\nf'(z) = d(2z + i)/dz = 2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the derivative at the point z = 1 + i:\n\nf'(1 + i) = 2\n\nSo, the complex derivative of the function f(z) = 2z + i at the point z = 1 + i is 2."
