    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x), we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx, where the integral is taken over one period of the function.\n\nFor n > 0, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(-x * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\n\n∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to 0 = [-cos(n * x)/n - x * sin(n * x)/n^2] from -π to 0 = (π * cos(n * π) - 1)/n^2\n\n∫(-x * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π = [cos(n * x)/n + x * sin(n * x)/n^2] from 0 to π = (π * cos(n * π) - 1)/n^2\n\nSo, b_n = (1/π) * [(π * cos(n * π) - 1)/n^2 + (π * cos(n * π) - 1)/n^2] = (2 * (π * cos(n * π) - 1))/n^2\n\nNow we have the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2 * (π * cos(n * π) - 1))/n^2 * sin(n * x)]\n\nThe first five non-zero terms in the series are:\n\nf(x) ≈ (2 * (π - 1))/1^2 * sin(1 * x) + (2 * (π + 1))/3^2 * sin(3 * x) + (2 * (π - 1))/5^2 * sin(5 * x) + (2 * (π + 1))/7^2 * sin(7 * x) + (2 * (π - 1))/9^2 * sin(9 * x)\n\nTo plot the function, you can use any graphing software or calculator and input the above expression for f(x)."
