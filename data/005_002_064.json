    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, we will use the t-distribution since the population standard deviation is unknown. The formula for the confidence interval is:\n\nCI = x̄ ± t * (s / √n)\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean\nt = t-score from the t-distribution table\ns = sample standard deviation\nn = sample size\n\nFirst, we need to find the degrees of freedom (df) which is equal to the sample size minus 1:\n\ndf = n - 1\ndf = 50 - 1\ndf = 49\n\nNext, we need to find the t-score corresponding to a 95% confidence level and 49 degrees of freedom. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the t-score is approximately 2.0096.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 75 ± 2.0096 * (10 / √50)\n\nCI = 75 ± 2.0096 * (10 / 7.071)\n\nCI = 75 ± 2.0096 * 1.414\n\nCI = 75 ± 2.840\n\nThe lower limit of the confidence interval is:\n\n75 - 2.840 = 72.160\n\nThe upper limit of the confidence interval is:\n\n75 + 2.840 = 77.840\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (72.160, 77.840)."
