    "message_1": "A manufacturing process produces 10,000 units of a certain product. The probability of a defective unit being produced is 0.05%. What is the probability that exactly 5 units will be defective in this batch?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (defective units in this case)\n- n is the total number of trials (total units produced)\n- x is the number of successes (defective units)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (n! / (x! * (n-x)!))\n- p is the probability of success (probability of a defective unit)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (probability of a non-defective unit)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 10,000\n- x = 5\n- p = 0.05% = 0.0005\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(5) = (10000C5) * (0.0005^5) * (1-0.0005)^(10000-5)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 10000C5:\n\n10000C5 = 10000! / (5! * (10000-5)!)\n= 10000! / (5! * 9995!)\n= (10000 * 9999 * 9998 * 9997 * 9996) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 8,033,297,496\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.0005^5) and (1-0.0005)^(10000-5):\n\n(0.0005^5) = 9.765625e-19\n(1-0.0005)^(9995) = 0.00673794699\n\nFinally, let's plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(5) = 8,033,297,496 * 9.765625e-19 * 0.00673794699\nP(5) â‰ˆ 0.0526\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 5 units will be defective in this batch is approximately 5.26%."
