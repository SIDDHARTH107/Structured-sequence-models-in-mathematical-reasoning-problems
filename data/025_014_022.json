    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space of theta functions associated to the divisor D on X, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a smooth projective curve X of genus g, the dimension of the space of global sections L(D) is given by:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) - g + 1 + l(K - D),\n\nwhere K is the canonical divisor on X, and l(K - D) is the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle associated to the divisor K - D.\n\nIn our case, we have a curve X of genus g = 3, and a divisor D linearly equivalent to 3 times a point. Thus, deg(D) = 3.\n\nNow, we need to compute l(K - D). The canonical divisor K has degree 2g - 2 = 4. Since D has degree 3, the divisor K - D has degree 1. Since the degree of K - D is less than the genus of the curve, by the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have l(K - D) = 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of the vector space of theta functions associated to the divisor D on X using the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) - g + 1 + l(K - D) = 3 - 3 + 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThus, the dimension of the vector space of theta functions associated to the divisor D on X is 1."
