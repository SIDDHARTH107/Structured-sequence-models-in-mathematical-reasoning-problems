    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we'll first evaluate each logarithm separately and then perform the subtraction.\n\n1. Evaluate $log_4{64}$:\n\nSince $4^3 = 64$, we have $log_4{64} = 3$.\n\n2. Evaluate $3log_2{16}$:\n\nSince $2^4 = 16$, we have $log_2{16} = 4$. Now, multiply this by 3: $3log_2{16} = 3(4) = 12$.\n\n3. Perform the subtraction:\n\n$log_4{64} - 3log_2{16} = 3 - 12 = -9$.\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is $-9$."
