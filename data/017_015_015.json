    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 24. Since 24 = 2^3 * 3, by the Sylow theorems, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since both are normal, G is a direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to C_8 x C_3, which is the cyclic group C24.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal. The Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal. Let Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is normal, we can form the semidirect product G = P ⋊ Q. There are two possibilities for the action of Q on P: the trivial action and the non-trivial action. The trivial action gives the direct product C_8 x C_3, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C24. The non-trivial action gives a non-abelian group of order 24, which we will call G1.\n\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal. The Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since Q is normal, we can form the semidirect product G = P ⋊ Q. There are two possibilities for the action of Q on P: the trivial action and the non-trivial action. The trivial action gives the direct product C_2^3 x C_3, which is isomorphic to the direct product of C_8 and C_3. The non-trivial action gives a non-abelian group of order 24, which we will call G2.\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4\nIn this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since |P ∩ Q| = 1, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 8 * 3 = 24. Thus, G = PQ. There are three possibilities for the action of Q on P: the trivial action, the non-trivial action with a fixed point, and the non-trivial action without a fixed point. The trivial action gives the direct product C_2^3 x C_3, which is isomorphic to the direct product of C_8 and C_3. The non-trivial action with a fixed point gives a non-abelian group of order 24, which we will call G3. The non-trivial action without a fixed point gives the alternating group A5.\n\nIn summary, we have found the following non-isomorphic groups of order 24:\n\n1. The cyclic group C24\n2. The non-abelian group G1\n3. The non-abelian group G2\n4. The non-abelian group G3\n5. The alternating group A5\n\nThus, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
