    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 30 students are taking either Math or Science or both. If 18 students are taking Math and 20 students are taking Science, how many students are taking both Math and Science? (Hint: use the inclusion-exclusion principle)",
    "message_2": "Let's use the inclusion-exclusion principle to solve this problem.\n\nLet M be the number of students taking Math, S be the number of students taking Science, and B be the number of students taking both Math and Science.\n\nAccording to the problem, we have:\n\nM = 18\nS = 20\nTotal number of students = 30\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can find the number of students taking both Math and Science:\n\nTotal number of students = M + S - B\n\nWe need to find B, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nB = M + S - Total number of students\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nB = 18 + 20 - 30\nB = 38 - 30\nB = 8\n\nSo, 8 students are taking both Math and Science."
