    "message_2": "To find the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide 27 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this normal 3-Sylow subgroup. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. There are two possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 9: Z_9 (cyclic) and Z_3 × Z_3 (elementary abelian). \n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z_9, then G has a normal subgroup isomorphic to Z_9. Since |G| = 27 and |P| = 9, by the factor group theorem, G/P has order 3. Thus, G is a semidirect product of P and G/P. In this case, G is isomorphic to Z_27, the cyclic group of order 27.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3, then G has a normal subgroup isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3. Again, since |G| = 27 and |P| = 9, G/P has order 3. Thus, G is a semidirect product of P and G/P. In this case, G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 27, which we will denote as G_1.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, none of them can be normal in G. However, this case cannot occur, because a group of order p^3 (where p is a prime) always has a normal subgroup of order p^2 (in this case, 9). This is a contradiction, so there is no group of order 27 with three 3-Sylow subgroups.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 27: Z_27 (cyclic) and G_1 (non-abelian). Each of these classes contains at least one group, as shown in the cases above."
