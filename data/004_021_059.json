    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x), we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x).\n\nGiven f(x) = 2x³ - 6x² + 4x + 5, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x³ - 6x² + 4x + 5)\nf'(x) = 6x² - 12x + 4\n\nNow let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x² - 12x + 4)\nf''(x) = 12x - 12\n\nNow we need to evaluate f''(x) at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 12(2) - 12\nf''(2) = 24 - 12\nf''(2) = 12\n\nSo the second derivative of f(x) evaluated at x = 2 is 12."
