She has seven tasks to complete, each with a different duration, as shown below:\n\nTask 1: 4 hours\nTask 2: 2 hours\nTask 3: 6 hours\nTask 4: 3 hours\nTask 5: 9 hours\nTask 6: 5 hours\nTask 7: 7 hours\n\nIf Samantha has eight hours to work on the project each day, what is the optimal way for her to schedule the tasks to minimize the time it takes to complete the project?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the time it takes to complete the project, Samantha should prioritize the tasks with the longest duration first. This is known as the \"Longest Processing Time\" (LPT) rule. Here's the optimal schedule for Samantha:\n\nDay 1:\n- Task 5: 9 hours (1 hour will be carried over to the next day)\n\nDay 2:\n- Task 5: 1 hour (remaining from Day 1)\n- Task 7: 7 hours\n\nDay 3:\n- Task 3: 6 hours\n- Task 2: 2 hours\n\nDay 4:\n- Task 6: 5 hours\n- Task 1: 3 hours\n\nDay 5:\n- Task 4: 3 hours\n\nIn this schedule, Samantha will complete the project in 5 days."
