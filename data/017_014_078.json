    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 20. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup P of order 5 and a Sylow 2-subgroup Q of order 4. Since the order of P is prime, P is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Similarly, since the order of Q is 4, Q is either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group).\n\nNow, let's find the value of n, the number of elements of order 5 in G. Since P is a cyclic group of order 5, it has 4 elements of order 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 5 and divides the index [G:P] = 20/5 = 4. Thus, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which means n = 4.\n\nNow, let's determine the possible structures of G based on the value of n. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. We have three cases to consider:\n\n1. If Q is isomorphic to C4, then G is a semi-direct product of P and Q. Since there are only two possible actions of Q on P (trivial and non-trivial), there are two possible semi-direct products: one is the direct product C5 × C4, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, and the other is a non-abelian group of order 20.\n\n2. If Q is isomorphic to V4, then G is also a semi-direct product of P and Q. In this case, there is only one non-trivial action of Q on P, which results in a group isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\n3. If G is a direct product of P and Q, then G is isomorphic to either C5 × C4 (which is isomorphic to C20) or C5 × V4 (which is isomorphic to D10).\n\nIn conclusion, depending on the structure of the Sylow 2-subgroup Q and the action of Q on P, the group G of order 20 with n = 4 elements of order 5 can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or a non-abelian group of order 20."
