    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces light bulbs which are known to have a mean life of 1200 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. What is the probability that a random sample of 25 light bulbs will have a mean life of less than 1180 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the information, we have:\n\nPopulation mean (μ) = 1200 hours\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 100 hours\nSample size (n) = 25 light bulbs\nSample mean (x̄) = 1180 hours\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 100 / √25\nSE = 100 / 5\nSE = 20\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score, which represents how many standard errors away from the population mean our sample mean is. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nz = (1180 - 1200) / 20\nz = (-20) / 20\nz = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a random sample of 25 light bulbs will have a mean life of less than 1180 hours. This is equivalent to finding the area to the left of the z-score of -1 in the standard normal distribution table.\n\nLooking up the z-score of -1 in the standard normal distribution table, we find that the area to the left of -1 is 0.1587.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a random sample of 25 light bulbs will have a mean life of less than 1180 hours is 0.1587, or 15.87%."
