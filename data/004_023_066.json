    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y=x^2 and y=x from x=0 to x=2, we need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the given interval.\n\nThe difference between the two functions is y=x - x^2. Now we need to integrate this function from x=0 to x=2:\n\nâˆ«(x - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nFirst, find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nF(x) = (1/2)x^2 - (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n\nF(2) - F(0) = [(1/2)(2)^2 - (1/3)(2)^3] - [(1/2)(0)^2 - (1/3)(0)^3]\n= [(1/2)(4) - (1/3)(8)] - [0]\n= [2 - (8/3)]\n= [6/3 - 8/3]\n= -2/3\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the result:\n\nArea = |-2/3| = 2/3\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the two curves from x=0 to x=2 is 2/3 square units."
