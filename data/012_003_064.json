    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices in an undirected graph is a set of vertices where no two vertices are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). To find the maximum independent set, we want to find the largest set of vertices that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 4 -- 6\n \\  / \\  /\n  3 -- 5\n\n7 -- 8\n\nWe can see that the graph has two connected components: one with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and another with vertices {7, 8}.\n\nFor the connected component with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we can find the following independent sets:\n\n- {1, 4, 5}\n- {2, 3, 6}\n\nBoth of these sets have 3 vertices, so they are the maximum independent sets for this connected component.\n\nFor the connected component with vertices {7, 8}, there is no edge between them, so the maximum independent set is {7, 8}.\n\nNow, combining the maximum independent sets from both connected components, we get the maximum independent set for the entire graph G:\n\n{1, 4, 5, 7, 8} or {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nBoth of these sets have 5 vertices, so the maximum independent set of vertices in the given graph G has a size of 5."
