    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to produce a rectangular box with volume 1000 cubic centimeters. The cost of the material for the lid is twice the cost of material for the base, and the cost of material for the sides is three times the cost of material for the base. If the company wants to minimize the cost of material, what should be the dimensions of the rectangular box?",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, and z, where x and y are the dimensions of the base, and z is the height. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = xyz = 1000 cm³\n\nThe cost of the material for the base is proportional to its area, which is given by:\n\nA_base = xy\n\nThe cost of the material for the lid is twice the cost of the material for the base, so the area of the lid is:\n\nA_lid = 2(xy)\n\nThe cost of the material for the sides is three times the cost of the material for the base, so the combined area of the four sides is:\n\nA_sides = 3(xy)\n\nThe combined area of the four sides can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of each pair of opposite sides:\n\nA_sides = 2(xz) + 2(yz)\n\nNow we can set up an equation for the total cost of the material:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lid + A_sides\nA_total = xy + 2(xy) + 3(xy)\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for A_sides:\n\nA_total = xy + 2(xy) + (2(xz) + 2(yz))\nA_total = 3(xy) + 2(xz) + 2(yz)\n\nSince we want to minimize the cost of the material, we want to minimize A_total. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable λ and form the following equation:\n\nF(x, y, z, λ) = 3(xy) + 2(xz) + 2(yz) - λ(xyz - 1000)\n\nNow we take the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, z, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂F/∂x = 3y + 2z - λyz = 0\n∂F/∂y = 3x + 2z - λxz = 0\n∂F/∂z = 2x + 2y - λxy = 0\n∂F/∂λ = xyz - 1000 = 0\n\nNow we have a system of four equations with four unknowns. We can solve this system to find the optimal dimensions of the box. From the first equation, we can express λ as:\n\nλ = (3y + 2z) / yz\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation, we can express λ as:\n\nλ = (3x + 2z) / xz\n\nSetting these two expressions for λ equal to each other, we get:\n\n(3y + 2z) / yz = (3x + 2z) / xz\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n(3y + 2z)xz = (3x + 2z)yz\n\nDividing both sides by 2z, we get:\n\n(3y/2 + 1)x = (3x/2 + 1)y\n\nNow, we can rearrange the terms:\n\n(3y/2 + 1)x - (3x/2 + 1)y = 0\n\nFactoring out x and y, we get:\n\nx(3y/2 - 3x/2) = y(3x/2 - 3y/2)\n\nDividing both sides by 3/2, we get:\n\nx(y - x) = y(x - y)\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1) x = y\n2) y - x = x - y\n\nFor the first case, x = y, we can substitute x for y in the third equation:\n\n2x + 2x - λx^2 = 0\n4x - λx^2 = 0\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for λ from the first equation:\n\n4x - ((3x + 2z) / xz)x^2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by xz, we get:\n\n4x^2z - (3x + 2z)x^3 = 0\n\nNow, we can substitute x = y in the fourth equation:\n\nx^2z - 1000 = 0\n\nFrom this equation, we get:\n\nz = 1000 / x^2\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for z in the equation we derived earlier:\n\n4x^2(1000 / x^2) - (3x + 2(1000 / x^2))x^3 = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4000 - (3x^5 + 2000x) = 0\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve analytically, but we can use numerical methods to find the solution. Using a numerical solver, we find that x ≈ 5.72 cm. Since x = y, we also have y ≈ 5.72 cm. Now, we can substitute this value into the expression for z:\n\nz ≈ 1000 / (5.72)^2 ≈ 30.53 cm\n\nSo, the optimal dimensions of the box to minimize the cost of the material are approximately x = 5.72 cm, y = 5.72 cm, and z = 30.53 cm."
