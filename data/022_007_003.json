    "message_2": "To show that $f$ is a linear function, we will use the Cauchy integral formula and Liouville's theorem.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Cauchy integral formula for the $n$-th derivative of an entire function $f$:\n\n$$f^{(n)}(z_0) = \\frac{n!}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{C} \\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}} dz$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a simple closed positively oriented contour containing $z_0$ in its interior.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(z) = f(z) - az - b$ for some constants $a, b \\in \\mathbb{C}$. We want to show that $g(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nWe have that $|g(z)| = |f(z) - az - b| \\leq |f(z)| + |az + b| \\leq 10|z| + |az + b|$.\n\nLet's now compute the second derivative of $g(z)$ using the Cauchy integral formula:\n\n$$g''(z_0) = \\frac{2!}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{C} \\frac{g(z)}{(z-z_0)^3} dz$$\n\nWe want to find an upper bound for $|g''(z_0)|$. To do this, let's consider a circle $C$ of radius $R$ centered at $z_0$. Then, for $z \\in C$, we have:\n\n$$|z - z_0| = R$$\n\nand\n\n$$|g(z)| \\leq 10|z| + |az + b| \\leq 10(|z_0| + R) + |a||z_0| + |a|R + |b|$$\n\nNow, we can bound $|g''(z_0)|$:\n\n$$|g''(z_0)| \\leq \\frac{2!}{2\\pi} \\oint_{C} \\frac{|g(z)|}{R^3} |dz| \\leq \\frac{2}{\\pi R^2} (10(|z_0| + R) + |a||z_0| + |a|R + |b|) \\cdot 2\\pi R$$\n\n$$|g''(z_0)| \\leq \\frac{4}{R} (10(|z_0| + R) + |a||z_0| + |a|R + |b|)$$\n\nNow, let's take the limit as $R \\to \\infty$:\n\n$$\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} |g''(z_0)| \\leq \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{4}{R} (10(|z_0| + R) + |a||z_0| + |a|R + |b|) = 0$$\n\nSince $|g''(z_0)| \\geq 0$, we have that $g''(z_0) = 0$ for all $z_0 \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThus, $g(z)$ is a function with zero second derivative, which means it must be of the form $g(z) = az + b$ for some constants $a, b \\in \\mathbb{C}$. But this means that $f(z) = g(z) + az + b = (a+a)z + (b+b) = 2az + 2b$, which is a linear function.\n\nTherefore, $f(z)$ is a linear function of the form $f(z) = az + b$ for some constants $a, b \\in \\mathbb{C}$."
