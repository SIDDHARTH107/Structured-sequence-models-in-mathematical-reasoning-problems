    "message_1": "Here's a possible math problem related to the Dictator Game in Game Theory:\n\nIn a Dictator Game between two players, Player A has $100 to split with Player B. Player A can decide how much money to give to Player B and how much to keep for himself/herself. If Player B accepts the offer, both players keep the agreed amounts; if Player B rejects the offer, both players get $0. Find the Nash equilibrium for this game.\n\nHint: The Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies such that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming the other players' strategies remain the same.",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, Player A has complete control over the division of the $100, and Player B has no influence on the outcome other than accepting or rejecting the offer. Since rejecting the offer would result in both players receiving $0, it is always in Player B's best interest to accept any offer made by Player A, as any amount is better than nothing.\n\nGiven this, Player A knows that Player B will accept any offer, so the Nash equilibrium occurs when Player A chooses to keep as much money as possible for themselves. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when Player A keeps the entire $100 and offers $0 to Player B. Since Player B will accept any offer, they will accept the $0 offer, and the game ends with Player A receiving $100 and Player B receiving $0."
