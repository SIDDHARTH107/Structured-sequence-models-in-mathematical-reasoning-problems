    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by -1:\n\n(1) 2x + 3y + 4z = 6 + 4i\n(2) 3x + 15y - 6z = -24 - 3i\n(3) -3x + y - 2z = -5 - 2i\n\nNow, add equations (2) and (3):\n\n(4) 16y - 8z = -29 - 5i\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by 2:\n\n(1) 6x + 9y + 12z = 18 + 12i\n(3) -6x + 2y - 4z = -10 - 4i\n\nNow, add equations (1) and (3):\n\n(5) 11y + 8z = 8 + 8i\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, y and z:\n\n(4) 16y - 8z = -29 - 5i\n(5) 11y + 8z = 8 + 8i\n\nAdd equations (4) and (5):\n\n(6) 27y = -21 + 3i\n\nNow, divide both sides of equation (6) by 27:\n\ny = (-21 + 3i) / 27\n\ny = -7/9 + i/9\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into equation (4) or (5) to find the value of z. We will use equation (5):\n\n11y + 8z = 8 + 8i\n\n11(-7/9 + i/9) + 8z = 8 + 8i\n\n-77/9 + 11i/9 + 8z = 8 + 8i\n\nNow, isolate z:\n\n8z = 8 + 8i + 77/9 - 11i/9\n\n8z = (8 + 77/9) + (8 - 11/9)i\n\n8z = (149/9) + (61/9)i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 8:\n\nz = (149/72) + (61/72)i\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 6 + 4i\n\n2x + 3(-7/9 + i/9) + 4((149/72) + (61/72)i) = 6 + 4i\n\n2x - 7 + i + 2(149/36) + (61/18)i = 6 + 4i\n\nNow, isolate x:\n\n2x = 7 - i - 2(149/36) - (61/18)i + 6 + 4i\n\n2x = (13 - 298/36) + (3/18)i\n\n2x = (-23/36) + (1/6)i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = (-23/72) + (1/12)i\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = (-23/72) + (1/12)i\ny = -7/9 + i/9\nz = (149/72) + (61/72)i"
