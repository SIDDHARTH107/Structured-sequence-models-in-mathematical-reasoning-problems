    "message_1": "A photographer wants to remove noise from an image using a partial differential equation. The image is represented by a two-dimensional grid with dimensions 100 x 100. The photographer wants to use the heat equation, u_t = u_xx + u_yy, to process the image. For simplicity, assume that the initial image has a constant intensity of 50. The photographer wants to apply the heat equation for a time period of 5 seconds with a step size of 0.01 seconds. Write a MATLAB code to solve the heat equation for the image and create a before and after comparison.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation for the image, we can use the finite difference method. Here's a MATLAB code to do that:\n\n```MATLAB\n% Parameters\nwidth = 100;\nheight = 100;\nintensity = 50;\ntime_period = 5;\nstep_size = 0.01;\n\n% Initialize the image\nimage_initial = intensity * ones(height, width);\n\n% Heat equation parameters\nalpha = 1; % Diffusion coefficient\ndx = 1;\ndy = 1;\ndt = step_size;\nlambda_x = alpha * dt / dx^2;\nlambda_y = alpha * dt / dy^2;\n\n% Initialize the image after processing\nimage_final = image_initial;\n\n% Time loop\nfor t = 0:dt:time_period\n    % Spatial loop\n    for i = 2:height-1\n        for j = 2:width-1\n            % Finite difference method\n            image_final(i, j) = image_initial(i, j) + lambda_x * (image_initial(i+1, j) - 2 * image_initial(i, j) + image_initial(i-1, j)) + lambda_y * (image_initial(i, j+1) - 2 * image_initial(i, j) + image_initial(i, j-1));\n        end\n    end\n    % Update the image\n    image_initial = image_final;\nend\n\n% Display the images\nfigure;\nsubplot(1, 2, 1);\nimshow(image_initial, []);\ntitle('Before');\n\nsubplot(1, 2, 2);\nimshow(image_final, []);\ntitle('After');\n```\n\nThis code initializes a 100 x 100 image with a constant intensity of 50. It then applies the heat equation using the finite difference method for a time period of 5 seconds with a step size of 0.01 seconds. Finally, it displays the before and after images side by side for comparison."
