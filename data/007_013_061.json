    "message_2": "Goldbach's Conjecture, which remains unproven, states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Since the conjecture has not been disproven, there is currently no known smallest even integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."
