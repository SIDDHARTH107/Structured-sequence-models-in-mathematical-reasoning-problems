    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example question for a math student to solve related to epidemiology models:\n\nA new infectious disease has surfaced in a small town, and the number of infected individuals follows an exponential growth curve. After observing the data, the epidemiologists have estimated that the disease grows with a rate of 0.5 per day. On the 10th day, there are 500 infected individuals. \n\nAssuming that the disease continues to spread at the same rate, how many infected individuals are expected in the town after 15 days? Round your answer to the nearest integer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the exponential growth formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(rt)\n\nwhere N(t) is the number of infected individuals at time t, N0 is the initial number of infected individuals, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in days.\n\nWe are given that on the 10th day, there are 500 infected individuals, and the growth rate is 0.5 per day. We want to find the number of infected individuals after 15 days.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial number of infected individuals (N0). We can plug in the given values into the formula:\n\n500 = N0 * e^(0.5 * 10)\n\nNow, we can solve for N0:\n\nN0 = 500 / e^(0.5 * 10)\n\nN0 ≈ 27.07 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow that we have the initial number of infected individuals, we can find the number of infected individuals after 15 days:\n\nN(15) = 27.07 * e^(0.5 * 15)\n\nN(15) ≈ 27.07 * e^7.5\n\nN(15) ≈ 2992.65\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, there are approximately 2993 infected individuals expected in the town after 15 days."
