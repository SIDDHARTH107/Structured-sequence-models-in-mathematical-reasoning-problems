What is the minimum number of friends that need to wear the same color shirt for a matching trio to occur (i.e. three friends wearing the same color shirt)? Use Ramsey theory to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Using Ramsey theory, we can solve this problem by applying the Pigeonhole Principle. Since there are 3 colors (red, blue, and green) and 6 friends, we can divide the friends into 3 groups based on the color of their shirts.\n\nTo guarantee a matching trio, we can apply the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if there are n pigeonholes and n+1 pigeons, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this case, the pigeonholes are the colors, and the pigeons are the friends.\n\nIf we have 6 friends and 3 colors, we can divide the friends into groups based on their shirt colors. To ensure a matching trio, we can assume the worst-case scenario, which is that the first two friends wear different colors. In this case, we have:\n\n1. Friend 1 - Red\n2. Friend 2 - Blue\n3. Friend 3 - Green\n\nNow, for the remaining 3 friends, no matter which color they choose, there will be at least one color that is worn by at least 3 friends. For example, if Friend 4 chooses red, we have a matching trio of red shirts. If Friend 4 chooses blue, we have a matching trio of blue shirts. If Friend 4 chooses green, we have a matching trio of green shirts.\n\nSo, the minimum number of friends that need to wear the same color shirt for a matching trio to occur is 3."
