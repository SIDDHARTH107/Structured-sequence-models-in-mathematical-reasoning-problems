    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed contour is zero. To apply Cauchy's theorem, we first need to check if the function f(z) = 3z^2 - 2z is analytic.\n\nA function is analytic if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function f(z) is a polynomial, and polynomials are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic, we can apply Cauchy's theorem to the closed contour C consisting of the square with vertices at z = 0, z = 1, z = 1 + i, and z = i. According to Cauchy's theorem, the integral of f(z) over this closed contour is zero.\n\nSo, the complex integral of f(z) = 3z^2 - 2z over the closed contour C is 0."
