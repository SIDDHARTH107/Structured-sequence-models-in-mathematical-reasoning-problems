    "message_2": "To encode the message \"HELLO\" using the Hill Cipher with the given 2x2 encryption matrix, we first need to convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). For \"HELLO\", we have:\n\nH = 7\nE = 4\nL = 11\nL = 11\nO = 14\n\nSince we have a 2x2 matrix, we need to break the message into pairs of letters. In this case, we have the pairs (H, E) and (L, L), and we need to pad the last pair with an extra letter (O) to make it a pair. We can use the letter 'X' (23) as padding:\n\n(O, X) = (14, 23)\n\nNow, we multiply each pair by the encryption matrix:\n\n```\n[3 1]   [ 7]   [3*7 + 1*4]   [25]   [Z]\n[4 2] * [ 4] = [4*7 + 2*4] = [32] = [ 6] = [G]\n\n[3 1]   [11]   [3*11 + 1*11]   [44]   [18] = [S]\n[4 2] * [11] = [4*11 + 2*11] = [66] = [16] = [Q]\n\n[3 1]   [14]   [3*14 + 1*23]   [65]   [15] = [P]\n[4 2] * [23] = [4*14 + 2*23] = [110] = [ 8] = [I]\n```\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"ZGSQPI\"."
