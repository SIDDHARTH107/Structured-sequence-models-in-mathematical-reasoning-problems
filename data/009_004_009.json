    "message_1": "A spring-mass system is described by the differential equation $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+2\\frac{dy}{dt}+2y=0$, where $y$ is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position. If the mass weighs 2 kg and is displaced 5 cm from equilibrium with an initial velocity of 1 cm/s, what is the displacement equation of the mass as a function of time?",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement equation of the mass as a function of time, we first need to solve the given differential equation. The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients:\n\n$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 2\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = 0$\n\nWe can solve this equation by assuming a solution of the form:\n\n$y(t) = e^{rt}$\n\nwhere r is a constant. Differentiating y(t) with respect to t, we get:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = re^{rt}$\n\nand\n\n$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = r^2e^{rt}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the given differential equation, we get:\n\n$r^2e^{rt} + 2re^{rt} + 2e^{rt} = 0$\n\nFactoring out the common term $e^{rt}$, we get:\n\n$e^{rt}(r^2 + 2r + 2) = 0$\n\nSince $e^{rt}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by it, leaving us with the quadratic equation:\n\n$r^2 + 2r + 2 = 0$\n\nTo solve for r, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots:\n\n$r = -1 \\pm i$\n\nNow we can write the general solution as:\n\n$y(t) = e^{-t}(A\\cos(t) + B\\sin(t))$\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined by the initial conditions.\n\nThe initial conditions are:\n\n1. The mass is displaced 5 cm from equilibrium: $y(0) = 5$\n2. The initial velocity is 1 cm/s: $\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = 1$\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\n1. $y(0) = e^{-0}(A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0)) = 5$\n\n   $A = 5$\n\n2. To find the derivative of y(t), we differentiate the general solution:\n\n   $\\frac{dy}{dt} = e^{-t}(-A\\cos(t) - B\\sin(t)) + e^{-t}(-A\\sin(t) + B\\cos(t))$\n\n   Now, we apply the second initial condition:\n\n   $\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = e^{-0}(-5\\cos(0) - B\\sin(0)) + e^{-0}(-5\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0)) = 1$\n\n   $B = 1$\n\nSo, the displacement equation of the mass as a function of time is:\n\n$y(t) = e^{-t}(5\\cos(t) + \\sin(t))$"
