    "message_2": "To find the electric field at a distance of 1 meter from the wire, we will use the Fourier transform method. The electric field due to a charged wire can be expressed in terms of its charge density and the distance from the wire.\n\nLet's denote the charge density as λ(z) = 2 nC/m, and the observation point is located at (x, 0, 0) with x = 1 meter. The electric field E(x) can be expressed as:\n\nE(x) = (1/4πε₀) ∫[λ(z) / (x² + z²)^(3/2)] dz\n\nwhere ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C²/Nm²).\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier transform to solve this integral. The Fourier transform of the charge density λ(z) is:\n\nλ(k) = ∫[λ(z) * e^(-ikz)] dz\n\nSince λ(z) = 2 nC/m, we have:\n\nλ(k) = 2 * ∫[e^(-ikz)] dz\n\nThe integral is taken over the length of the wire, from -0.25 m to 0.25 m. Now, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of the electric field E(k):\n\nE(k) = (1/4πε₀) * (λ(k) / k²)\n\nNow, we can find the electric field E(x) by taking the inverse Fourier transform of E(k):\n\nE(x) = ∫[E(k) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nPlugging in the expressions for λ(k) and E(k), we have:\n\nE(x) = (1/4πε₀) * ∫[(2 / k²) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nNow, we can solve this integral. The integral is a standard integral, and its value is:\n\nE(x) = (1/4πε₀) * (2 * π * arctan(x))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for ε₀ and x:\n\nE(x) = (1/(4π * 8.854 x 10^(-12))) * (2 * π * arctan(1))\n\nE(x) ≈ 9.0 x 10^9 N/C\n\nSo, the electric field at a distance of 1 meter from the wire is approximately 9.0 x 10^9 N/C."
