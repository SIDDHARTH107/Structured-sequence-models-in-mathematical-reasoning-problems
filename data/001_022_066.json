    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 4x^2 - 11x + 30, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 4x^2 - 11x + 30\n\nTo graph the equation, we can create a table of values for x and y:\n\nx   | y\n---------\n-2  | 14\n-1  | 46\n0   | 30\n1   | 16\n2   | -6\n3   | -18\n4   | 0\n5   | 30\n6   | 78\n\nPlotting these points on the coordinate plane, we can see that the graph of the equation intersects the x-axis at three points: (2, 0), (3, 0), and (4, 0).\n\nTherefore, the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation are x = 2, x = 3, and x = 4."
