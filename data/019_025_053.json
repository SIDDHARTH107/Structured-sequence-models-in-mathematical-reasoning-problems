    "message_1": "A company produces widgets and there is a causal relationship between the number of workers hired and the number of widgets produced. If the company hires 5 more workers, they can produce 50 more widgets. Assuming this causal relationship continues, how many widgets can the company produce if they hire 8 more workers?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the number of widgets produced per worker. Since 5 more workers can produce 50 more widgets, we can set up a proportion:\n\n5 workers = 50 widgets\n1 worker = 50 widgets / 5 workers = 10 widgets per worker\n\nNow, we can find out how many widgets can be produced if the company hires 8 more workers:\n\n8 workers * 10 widgets per worker = 80 widgets\n\nSo, if the company hires 8 more workers, they can produce 80 more widgets."
