    "message_1": "A metal plate of dimensions 0.5 m x 0.5 m x 0.01 m is initially at a temperature of 100°C. It is then immersed in a liquid at a temperature of 20°C. The surface temperature of the plate is found to decrease at a rate of 0.02°C per second. Assuming the plate to be perfectly insulated except for the surfaces exposed to the liquid, find the temperature distribution at any time t after it is immersed in the liquid. Use the heat transfer and diffusion equations.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution at any time t after the metal plate is immersed in the liquid, we can use the heat diffusion equation, also known as the unsteady-state heat conduction equation:\n\n∂T/∂t = α * ( ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² + ∂²T/∂z² )\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity of the material, and x, y, and z are the spatial coordinates.\n\nSince the plate is thin (0.01 m), we can assume that the temperature distribution is uniform along the z-axis. Therefore, the heat diffusion equation simplifies to:\n\n∂T/∂t = α * ( ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² )\n\nTo solve this partial differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let T(x, y, t) = X(x) * Y(y) * Θ(t). Substituting this into the heat diffusion equation, we get:\n\nX * Y * Θ' = α * (X'' * Y * Θ + X * Y'' * Θ)\n\nDividing both sides by α * X * Y * Θ, we obtain:\n\n1/α * (Θ'/Θ) = (X''/X) + (Y''/Y)\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on time and the right side depends only on the spatial coordinates, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n1/α * (Θ'/Θ) = -λ\n(X''/X) + (Y''/Y) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nΘ'/Θ = -α * λ\nX''/X = -μ\nY''/Y = -(λ - μ)\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nΘ(t) = C1 * exp(-α * λ * t)\nX(x) = C2 * cos(√μ * x) + C3 * sin(√μ * x)\nY(y) = C4 * cosh(√(λ - μ) * y) + C5 * sinh(√(λ - μ) * y)\n\nNow we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 0.5, t) = 20°C\n2. T(0, y, t) = T(0.5, y, t) = 20°C\n3. T(x, y, 0) = 100°C\n\nApplying the boundary conditions and using Fourier series, we can find the temperature distribution T(x, y, t) as a function of time and spatial coordinates:\n\nT(x, y, t) = 20 + ∑[ (A_n * cos(n * π * x) * cosh(n * π * y) * exp(-α * (n * π)² * t)) ]\n\nwhere A_n are the Fourier coefficients, which can be found using the initial temperature distribution T(x, y, 0) = 100°C:\n\nA_n = (4/0.25) * ∫[ (100 - 20) * cos(n * π * x) * dx ] from 0 to 0.5\n\nSolving for A_n, we get:\n\nA_n = (16/π) * [ sin(n * π) / n ]\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution T(x, y, t) is given by:\n\nT(x, y, t) = 20 + ∑[ ( (16/π) * [ sin(n * π) / n ] * cos(n * π * x) * cosh(n * π * y) * exp(-α * (n * π)² * t)) ]\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution of the metal plate at any time t after it is immersed in the liquid."
