Find the global minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x in the interval [-5, 5]. Use a population size of 20 and run the algorithm for 50 generations.",
    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using the differential evolution algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of size 20 with random values within the interval [-5, 5].\n2. For each generation, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each individual in the population, select three other distinct individuals randomly.\n   b. Perform mutation by calculating the difference between two of the selected individuals and adding it to the third one, scaled by a mutation factor F (usually between 0.5 and 1).\n   c. Perform crossover by mixing the mutated individual with the original one, using a crossover probability CR (usually between 0.5 and 1).\n   d. Evaluate the fitness of the new individual (i.e., the value of f(x) for the new x) and replace the original individual if the new one has a better fitness.\n3. Repeat step 2 for 50 generations.\n4. Find the individual with the best fitness in the final population.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I cannot execute the algorithm and provide the exact values for the global minimum and the corresponding x value. You can implement the differential evolution algorithm in a programming language like Python to find the solution.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the global minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x analytically by taking the derivative of f(x) and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 5\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n\n0 = 2x - 5\nx = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nNow, we can find the global minimum value of f(x) by plugging x = 2.5 back into the original function:\n\nf(2.5) = (2.5)^2 - 5(2.5) + 6 = 6.25 - 12.5 + 6 = -0.25\n\nSo, the global minimum value of f(x) is -0.25, and the corresponding value of x is 2.5."
