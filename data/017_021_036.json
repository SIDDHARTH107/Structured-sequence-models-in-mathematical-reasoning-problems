    "message_2": "To find all 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems and consider the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. \n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: There are two possibilities for the structure of the Sylow 2-subgroups: C4 × C4 and Q8 × C2, where Q8 is the quaternion group of order 8.\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: There is only one possibility for the structure of the Sylow 3-subgroups: C3.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible semi-direct products between the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. C4 × C4 ⋊ C3: There are three possible actions of C3 on C4 × C4, which correspond to three non-abelian groups of order 48:\n   - G1: C3 acts by inverting one of the C4 factors.\n   - G2: C3 acts by inverting both C4 factors.\n   - G3: C3 acts by swapping the two C4 factors and inverting one of them.\n\n2. Q8 × C2 ⋊ C3: There are two possible actions of C3 on Q8 × C2, which correspond to two non-abelian groups of order 48:\n   - G4: C3 acts by inverting the Q8 factor.\n   - G5: C3 acts trivially on Q8 and inverts the C2 factor.\n\nNow, we need to consider the extensions of Q8 by C2:\n\n3. Extensions of Q8 by C2: There are 9 non-equivalent extensions of Q8 by C2, which correspond to nine non-abelian groups of order 48:\n   - G6: Q8 ⋊ C2 (1)\n   - G7: Q8 ⋊ C2 (2)\n   - G8: Q8 ⋊ C2 (3)\n   - G9: Q8 ⋊ C2 (4)\n   - G10: Q8 ⋊ C2 (5)\n   - G11: Q8 ⋊ C2 (6)\n   - G12: Q8 ⋊ C2 (7)\n   - G13: Q8 ⋊ C2 (8)\n   - G14: Q8 ⋊ C2 (9)\n\nThese are the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nNow, let's compare them to the cyclic group C48 and the alternating group A4 × C4:\n\n- C48 is an abelian group, while all 14 groups listed above are non-abelian.\n- A4 × C4 has order 48, but it is a direct product of two smaller groups, A4 and C4. The 14 non-abelian groups listed above are not direct products of smaller groups and have different structures than A4 × C4."
