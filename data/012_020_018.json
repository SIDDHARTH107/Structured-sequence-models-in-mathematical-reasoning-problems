    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all automorphisms of the graph.\n\nIn this graph, we have 6 vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. We can observe the following:\n\n1. A and F are the only vertices with degree 1, so they must be fixed in any automorphism.\n2. B and E are the only vertices with degree 3, so they must be fixed or swapped in any automorphism.\n3. C and D are the only vertices with degree 2, so they must be fixed or swapped in any automorphism.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which fixes all vertices: (A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F)\n2. The automorphism that swaps B and E, and C and D: (A)(B E)(C D)(F)\n\nThese are the only two automorphisms that preserve adjacency in the graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is { (A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F), (A)(B E)(C D)(F) }."
