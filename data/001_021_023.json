    "message_2": "To find all solutions of the equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial.\n\nLet's try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nLet's test these possible roots:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0, so x = 1 is a root.\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n1 |  1  -6  11  -6\n     +1  -5  10\n    ------------\n      1  -5   6  -6\n```\n\nSo, the remaining quadratic factor is x^2 - 5x + 6. Now, we can factor this quadratic:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the original polynomial can be factored as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3).\n\nTherefore, the solutions of the equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3."
