The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 2  3 -4 |  8 |\n| 4  2  3 |  4 |\n| 3 -4  2 | -7 |\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  3/2 -2 |  4 |\n| 4  2   3  |  4 |\n| 3 -4   2  | -7 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 4*Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 3*Row1\n\n|  1  3/2 -2 |  4  |\n|  0 -4   11 | -12 |\n|  0 -11  8 | -19 |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -4 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  3/2 -2 |  4  |\n|  0  1  -11/4 |  3  |\n|  0 -11  8 | -19 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 + 11*Row2\n\n|  1  3/2 -2 |  4  |\n|  0  1  -11/4 |  3  |\n|  0  0  -3/4 |  14 |\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -3/4 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  3/2 -2 |  4  |\n|  0  1  -11/4 |  3  |\n|  0  0  1 | -56/3 |\n\nStep 6: Back-substitute to find the variables:\n\nz = -56/3\n\ny = 3 + 11/4 * (-56/3) = 3 - 154/3 = -145/3\n\nx = 4 - 3/2 * (-145/3) + 2 * (-56/3) = 4 + 217/2 - 112/3 = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = -145/3, and z = -56/3."
