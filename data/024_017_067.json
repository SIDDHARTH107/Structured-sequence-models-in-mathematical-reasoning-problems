    "message_1": "A student is given a problem to solve for the parallel transport of a vector along a curve. Let's say they have a curve in 3-dimensional space that is defined by the equation x(t) = 2cos(t), y(t) = 2sin(t), z(t) = 3t. They also have a vector v = (1,2,3) at the point (2,0,0) on the curve. What is the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve?",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve at any point. We can do this by taking the derivative of the curve with respect to t:\n\ndx/dt = -2sin(t)\ndy/dt = 2cos(t)\ndz/dt = 3\n\nSo, the tangent vector T(t) is given by:\n\nT(t) = (-2sin(t), 2cos(t), 3)\n\nNow, we need to find a vector field V(t) along the curve such that the covariant derivative of V(t) with respect to T(t) is zero. In other words, we need to find V(t) such that:\n\n∇_T(t) V(t) = 0\n\nSince we are working in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, the covariant derivative is the same as the regular derivative. Therefore, we need to find V(t) such that:\n\ndV(t)/dt * T(t) = 0\n\nLet V(t) = (A(t), B(t), C(t)). Then, we have:\n\nA'(t) * (-2sin(t)) + B'(t) * (2cos(t)) + C'(t) * 3 = 0\n\nWe are given that the vector v = (1, 2, 3) is at the point (2, 0, 0) on the curve. This corresponds to t = 0. So, we have the initial conditions:\n\nA(0) = 1\nB(0) = 2\nC(0) = 3\n\nNow, we need to solve the above differential equation with these initial conditions. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\nA'(t) * (-2sin(t)) = -B'(t) * (2cos(t)) - C'(t) * 3\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to t, we get:\n\nA(t) = -2∫sin(t)dt = 2cos(t) + C1\nB(t) = 2∫cos(t)dt = 2sin(t) + C2\nC(t) = -1/3∫3dt = -t + C3\n\nUsing the initial conditions, we find the constants C1, C2, and C3:\n\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 2\nC3 = 3\n\nSo, the parallel transported vector field V(t) along the curve is:\n\nV(t) = (2cos(t) + 1, 2sin(t) + 2, -t + 3)\n\nThis is the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve."
