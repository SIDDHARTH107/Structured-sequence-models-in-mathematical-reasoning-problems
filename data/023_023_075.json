    "message_1": "A network analyzer produces data that can be analyzed using the Fourier transform. A student has collected data on a network's behavior over time and has produced the following frequency spectra for the incoming and outgoing signals:\n\n- Incoming signal: a peak at 10 kHz with a magnitude of 5 V, and a peak at 20 kHz with a magnitude of 2 V\n- Outgoing signal: a peak at 10 kHz with a magnitude of 7 V, and a peak at 30 kHz with a magnitude of 3 V\n\nWhat is the gain and phase shift of the network at 10 kHz?",
    "message_2": "To find the gain and phase shift of the network at 10 kHz, we need to compare the incoming and outgoing signals at that frequency.\n\nGain is the ratio of the output magnitude to the input magnitude at a specific frequency. In this case, we are looking at the 10 kHz frequency.\n\nGain = (Output Magnitude at 10 kHz) / (Input Magnitude at 10 kHz)\nGain = (7 V) / (5 V)\nGain = 1.4\n\nNow, we need to find the phase shift. However, the given information does not provide the phase information for the incoming and outgoing signals. Therefore, we cannot determine the phase shift with the given data."
