    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose a committee of 4 people from a group of 10 people using Pascal's triangle, we need to find the binomial coefficient C(10, 4). Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The binomial coefficients can be found in Pascal's triangle.\n\nHere are the first few rows of Pascal's triangle:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n```\n\nTo find C(10, 4), we look at the 11th row (since we start counting from the 0th row) and the 4th element (again, starting from 0).\n\nThe 11th row of Pascal's triangle is:\n\n1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1\n\nThe 4th element in this row is 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to choose a committee of 4 people from a group of 10 people using Pascal's triangle."
