    "message_2": "First, let's find the union of sets A and B. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set A or set B or in both. \n\nUnion of A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, can be found as follows:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's show that the union of sets A and B is a superset of sets A and B. A set C is a superset of set A if every element of A is also an element of C. Similarly, a set C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nSince A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we can see that every element of set A and set B is also an element of A ∪ B. Therefore, the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B) is a superset of sets A and B."
