    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n[ 1  2  0 ]\n[ 0  1  3 ]\n[ 2  4  6 ]\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n[ 1  2  0 ]\n[ 0  1  3 ]\n[ 0  0  6 ]\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that there are no rows with all zeros, so the rank of matrix A is equal to the number of rows, which is 3. Therefore, the rank of matrix A is 3."
