Then, show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27 by constructing the multiplication table of G using the fact that there is either only one or nine Sylow 3-subgroups.",
    "message_2": "We will first use the Sylow theorems to determine the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nLet n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. The only divisors that satisfy the second condition are 1 and 9. Therefore, there are either 1 or 9 Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nCase 1: There is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup of G. Let P be this Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^3 = 27, P must be equal to G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 27, and G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nCase 2: There are nine Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nLet P be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is a normal subgroup of G. Let Q be another Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since P and Q are both normal subgroups, their intersection, P ∩ Q, is also a normal subgroup of G. The order of P ∩ Q must divide the order of both P and Q, which is 9. The only possibilities for the order of P ∩ Q are 1 and 3.\n\nIf the order of P ∩ Q is 3, then P ∩ Q is a subgroup of order 3 in both P and Q. Since the order of P and Q is 9, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. Therefore, the order of P ∩ Q must be 1, which means P ∩ Q is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the set PQ, which is the set of all products pq, where p is an element of P and q is an element of Q. Since P and Q are both normal subgroups of G, PQ is also a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is given by the product of the orders of P and Q divided by the order of their intersection:\n\n|PQ| = (|P| * |Q|) / |P ∩ Q| = (9 * 9) / 1 = 81.\n\nHowever, this is not possible since the order of G is 27. Therefore, there must be a contradiction in our assumption that there are nine Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nThus, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27."
