    "message_1": "I apologize, but I cannot generate numerical problems related to deontic logic as it is a philosophical branch of logic that deals with obligations, permissions, and prohibitions. It does not involve numerical calculations or equations. Instead, it deals with the relationship between a normative statement (e.g. \"One ought/ought not to do X\") and the world described by that statement. If you have any other questions related to deontic logic, I would be happy to assist you.",
    "message_2": "Thank you for the information about deontic logic. If you have any mathematical problems or questions related to other areas of mathematics, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help."
