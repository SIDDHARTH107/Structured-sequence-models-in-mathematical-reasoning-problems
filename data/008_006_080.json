    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[4 - λ, -2], [3, 1 - λ]]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n(4 - λ)(1 - λ) - (-2)(3) = λ^2 - 5λ + 10\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4(10))) / 2 = (5 ± √(25 - 40)) / 2 = (5 ± √(-15)) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + i√15) / 2 and λ2 = (5 - i√15) / 2.\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1:\n\n(A - λ1I) * v1 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ1 into the matrix:\n\n[[4 - (5 + i√15) / 2, -2], [3, 1 - (5 + i√15) / 2]] * v1 = 0\n\nSimplify the matrix:\n\n[[-(1 - i√15) / 2, -2], [3, -(3 - i√15) / 2]] * v1 = 0\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations to find the eigenvector v1. We can multiply the first row by 3 and add it to the second row:\n\n[[1, 2], [0, 0]] * v1 = 0\n\nSo, v1 = k1 * [2, 1], where k1 is a constant.\n\nFor λ2:\n\n(A - λ2I) * v2 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ2 into the matrix:\n\n[[4 - (5 - i√15) / 2, -2], [3, 1 - (5 - i√15) / 2]] * v2 = 0\n\nSimplify the matrix:\n\n[[-(1 + i√15) / 2, -2], [3, -(3 + i√15) / 2]] * v2 = 0\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations to find the eigenvector v2. We can multiply the first row by 3 and add it to the second row:\n\n[[1, 2], [0, 0]] * v2 = 0\n\nSo, v2 = k2 * [2, 1], where k2 is a constant.\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + i√15) / 2 and λ2 = (5 - i√15) / 2, and the corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = k1 * [2, 1] and v2 = k2 * [2, 1], where k1 and k2 are constants."
