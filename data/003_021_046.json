    "message_2": "To find the angle between the plane's direction of motion and a line pointing directly north, we can use the concept of vectors. Let's represent the plane's velocity vector as Vp and the wind's velocity vector as Vw. \n\nVp = 200 km/hr (eastward)\nVw = 50 km/hr (southward)\n\nThe plane's actual velocity vector (Va) is the vector sum of Vp and Vw.\n\nVa = Vp + Vw\n\nSince Vp is eastward and Vw is southward, we can represent them as:\n\nVp = 200i (where i is the unit vector in the eastward direction)\nVw = -50j (where j is the unit vector in the northward direction, and the negative sign indicates the southward direction)\n\nNow, we can find Va:\n\nVa = Vp + Vw = 200i - 50j\n\nTo find the angle (θ) between the plane's direction of motion (Va) and a line pointing directly north, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nVa • N = |Va| * |N| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere N is the northward unit vector (j), and |Va| and |N| are the magnitudes of Va and N, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of Va:\n\n|Va| = √(200^2 + (-50)^2) = √(40000 + 2500) = √42500 ≈ 206.16 km/hr\n\nSince N is a unit vector, its magnitude is 1:\n\n|N| = 1\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of Va and N:\n\nVa • N = (200i - 50j) • j = 200i • j - 50j • j = 0 - 50 = -50\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the angle θ:\n\n-50 = 206.16 * 1 * cos(θ)\ncos(θ) = -50 / 206.16\nθ = arccos(-50 / 206.16) ≈ 106.7°\n\nSo, the angle between the plane's direction of motion and a line pointing directly north is approximately 106.7°."
