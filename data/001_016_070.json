    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation $4^{3x-1} = 8$, we can first express both sides of the equation with the same base. Since 4 and 8 are both powers of 2, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n$(2^2)^{3x-1} = 2^3$\n\nNow, we can use the power of a power property to simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n$2^{(3x-1) \\cdot 2} = 2^3$\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n$(3x-1) \\cdot 2 = 3$\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$6x - 2 = 3$\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n$6x = 5$\n\nDivide by 6:\n\n$x = \\frac{5}{6}$"
