    "message_2": "Let $w = z^2$. Then, the given equation becomes $w^3 + 6w^2 + 36w + 20 = 0$. This is a cubic equation in $w$. We can try to find its roots using either factorization or other methods like Cardano's formula. However, in this case, it's not easy to factorize the equation directly. So, we can try to find an integer root using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number $p/q$ is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, then $p$ must divide the constant term and $q$ must divide the leading coefficient. In our case, the constant term is 20 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, any rational root must be a divisor of 20. We can test the divisors of 20: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 5, \\pm 10, \\pm 20$. \n\nBy testing these values, we find that $w = -2$ is a root of the cubic equation. Thus, $(w + 2)$ is a factor of the cubic equation. We can perform polynomial long division or synthetic division to find the other factor:\n\n$(w^3 + 6w^2 + 36w + 20) \\div (w + 2) = (w^2 + 4w + 10)$.\n\nNow, we have factored the cubic equation as $(w + 2)(w^2 + 4w + 10) = 0$. We already have one root, $w = -2$. To find the other roots, we need to solve the quadratic equation $w^2 + 4w + 10 = 0$. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$w = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(10)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 40}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-24}}{2} = -2 \\pm 2i\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nSo, the roots of the cubic equation are $w = -2, -2 + 2i\\sqrt{6}, -2 - 2i\\sqrt{6}$. Now, we need to find the corresponding values of $z$ by solving $z^2 = w$ for each root:\n\n1. For $w = -2$, we have $z^2 = -2$, which gives $z = \\pm \\sqrt{-2} = \\pm i\\sqrt{2}$.\n2. For $w = -2 + 2i\\sqrt{6}$, we have $z^2 = -2 + 2i\\sqrt{6}$, which gives $z = \\pm \\sqrt{-1 + i\\sqrt{6}}$.\n3. For $w = -2 - 2i\\sqrt{6}$, we have $z^2 = -2 - 2i\\sqrt{6}$, which gives $z = \\pm \\sqrt{-1 - i\\sqrt{6}}$.\n\nThus, the complex numbers $z$ that satisfy the given equation are:\n\n$z = \\pm i\\sqrt{2}, \\pm \\sqrt{-1 + i\\sqrt{6}}, \\pm \\sqrt{-1 - i\\sqrt{6}}$."
