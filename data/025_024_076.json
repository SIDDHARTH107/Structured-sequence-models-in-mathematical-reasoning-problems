    "message_1": "A math student wants to calculate the number of independent invariants of binary forms of degree three (also known as cubic forms) under the action of linear transformations. \n\nWrite down the explicit forms of cubic polynomials where the number of independent invariants is maximum.",
    "message_2": "A binary cubic form can be written as a homogeneous polynomial of degree three in two variables x and y:\n\nF(x, y) = ax^3 + bx^2y + cxy^2 + dy^3\n\nUnder the action of linear transformations, we can find the independent invariants by using the method of classical invariant theory. In the case of binary cubic forms, there are two independent invariants, which are the cubic and the sextic invariants.\n\nThe cubic invariant (I) can be expressed as:\n\nI = 18abcd - 4b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4ac^3 - 27a^2d^2\n\nThe sextic invariant (J) can be expressed as:\n\nJ = (4ac - b^2)^3 - 27a^2(d^2 - bc)^2\n\nThe maximum number of independent invariants for binary cubic forms is 2, which are I and J. The explicit forms of cubic polynomials with the maximum number of independent invariants can be obtained by setting I and J to nonzero values."
