    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem for a math student:\n\nA metal plate of dimensions 3m x 2m x 0.2m is initially held at a temperature of 100°C. The plate is cooled by surrounding air at a temperature of 25°C. Using the heat transfer and diffusion equation, calculate the time taken (in seconds) for the centre of the plate to cool to a temperature of 50°C. Assume the thermal diffusivity of the metal to be 0.01m²/s.\n\n(Note: The heat transfer and diffusion equation for a metal plate can be expressed as follows: ∂u/∂t = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² + ∂²u/∂z²), where u is the temperature of the metal, t is time, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the metal.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat transfer and diffusion equation in the form of a simplified one-dimensional heat equation, since the plate is thin and we are interested in the temperature at the center of the plate. The one-dimensional heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nWe will also use the concept of a semi-infinite solid, which means that the plate is considered to be infinitely large in the x and y directions. This simplification allows us to use the error function solution to the heat equation. The temperature distribution in a semi-infinite solid is given by:\n\nu(x, t) = T_initial + (T_air - T_initial) * erf(x / (2 * sqrt(α * t)))\n\nwhere T_initial is the initial temperature (100°C), T_air is the surrounding air temperature (25°C), and erf is the error function.\n\nWe want to find the time t when the temperature at the center of the plate (x = 0.1m, since the plate is 0.2m thick) reaches 50°C. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n50 = 100 + (25 - 100) * erf(0.1 / (2 * sqrt(0.01 * t)))\n\nNow, we need to solve for t. First, let's simplify the equation:\n\n25 = -75 * erf(0.1 / (2 * sqrt(0.01 * t)))\n\nNext, divide both sides by -75:\n\n-1/3 = erf(0.1 / (2 * sqrt(0.01 * t)))\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse error function (erf^(-1)) of -1/3:\n\nerf^(-1)(-1/3) = 0.1 / (2 * sqrt(0.01 * t))\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(erf^(-1)(-1/3))^2 = (0.1 / (2 * sqrt(0.01 * t)))^2\n\nNow, isolate t:\n\nt = (0.1 / (2 * sqrt(0.01)))^2 / (erf^(-1)(-1/3))^2\n\nPlug in the values and calculate:\n\nt ≈ (0.1 / (2 * sqrt(0.01)))^2 / (0.430727)^2\nt ≈ (0.1 / 0.2)^2 / (0.430727)^2\nt ≈ 0.25 / 0.185526\nt ≈ 1.3477 seconds\n\nSo, it takes approximately 1.35 seconds for the center of the plate to cool to a temperature of 50°C."
