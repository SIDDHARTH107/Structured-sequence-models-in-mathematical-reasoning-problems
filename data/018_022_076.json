    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. The Cartesian product of A and B is (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4). \n\nDetermine the symmetric difference of A and B with respect to their Cartesian product.

    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A△B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In this case, A△B = {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A△B) and C, denoted as (A△B) × C. Since A△B = {1, 4} and C = {1, 2, 3}, the Cartesian product (A△B) × C is:\n\n{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products A × C and B × C:\n\nA × C = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}\nB × C = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A × C and B × C, denoted as A × C △ B × C.

However, this does not prove that it is always commutative for all sets A, B, and C. It just happens to be true for these specific sets."
