    "message_1": "Assuming that in a school of 120 students, the probability of a student being elected as a class monitor is 0.25. What is the probability that exactly 30 students will be elected as class monitors?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, students being elected as class monitors)\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as nCx or \"n choose x\")\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of students, which is 120)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, the number of students elected as class monitors, which is 30)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a student being elected as a class monitor, which is 0.25)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a student not being elected as a class monitor, which is 0.75)\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(30) = C(120, 30) * 0.25^30 * 0.75^(120-30)\n\nFirst, we calculate C(120, 30), which is the number of ways to choose 30 students from 120:\n\nC(120, 30) = 120! / (30! * (120-30)!)\nC(120, 30) = 120! / (30! * 90!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(30) = (120! / (30! * 90!)) * 0.25^30 * 0.75^90\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(30) â‰ˆ 0.0014\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 30 students will be elected as class monitors is approximately 0.0014 or 0.14%."
