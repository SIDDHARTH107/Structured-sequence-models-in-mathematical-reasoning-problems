    "message_2": "To prove that $N$ is a smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of dimension $n+1$, we need to show that for each point $p \\in N$, there exists a smooth chart $(U, \\phi)$ around $p$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $\\phi(U \\cap N)$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the standard topology.\n\nLet $p = (x_0, f(x_0)) \\in N$ for some $x_0 \\in M$. Since $M$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $n$, there exists a smooth chart $(V, \\psi)$ around $x_0$ in $M$ such that $\\psi(V)$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Define a map $\\Phi: V \\times \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by $\\Phi(x, t) = (x, f(x) + t)$. Note that $\\Phi$ is smooth since $f$ is smooth.\n\nNow, we claim that $\\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism from an open neighborhood $U$ of $(x_0, 0)$ in $V \\times \\mathbb{R}$ onto an open neighborhood of $p$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. To see this, we first show that $\\Phi$ is injective. Suppose $\\Phi(x_1, t_1) = \\Phi(x_2, t_2)$. Then $(x_1, f(x_1) + t_1) = (x_2, f(x_2) + t_2)$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$ and $f(x_1) + t_1 = f(x_2) + t_2$. Since $f$ is a function, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, and thus $t_1 = t_2$. Therefore, $\\Phi$ is injective.\n\nNext, we show that the differential of $\\Phi$ at each point is invertible. The differential of $\\Phi$ is given by the matrix\n\n$$\nD\\Phi(x, t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\nI_n & Df(x) \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhere $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix and $Df(x)$ is the gradient of $f$ at $x$. The determinant of this matrix is 1, which is nonzero, so $D\\Phi(x, t)$ is invertible for all $(x, t) \\in V \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince $\\Phi$ is injective and its differential is invertible, it follows that $\\Phi$ is a local diffeomorphism. Thus, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $(x_0, 0)$ in $V \\times \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism from $U$ onto an open neighborhood of $p$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nNow, consider the set $\\Phi(U \\cap (V \\times \\{0\\}))$. Since $\\Phi(x, 0) = (x, f(x))$ for all $x \\in V$, we have $\\Phi(U \\cap (V \\times \\{0\\})) = U \\cap N$. Moreover, since $\\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism, $\\Phi(U \\cap N)$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the standard topology.\n\nTherefore, for each point $p \\in N$, there exists a smooth chart $(U, \\Phi)$ around $p$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $\\Phi(U \\cap N)$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This shows that $N$ is a smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of dimension $n+1$."
