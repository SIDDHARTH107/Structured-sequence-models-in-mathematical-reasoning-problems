    "message_2": "To find the number of different ways to arrange the balls, we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset:\n\nn! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of balls, n1 is the number of red balls, n2 is the number of blue balls, and so on.\n\nIn this case, we have 5 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 3 green balls, so n = 5 + 2 + 3 = 10.\n\nThe formula becomes:\n\n10! / (5! * 2! * 3!)\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n10! = 3,628,800\n5! = 120\n2! = 2\n3! = 6\n\nNow, divide:\n\n3,628,800 / (120 * 2 * 6) = 3,628,800 / 1,440 = 2,520\n\nSo there are 2,520 different ways to arrange the 5 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 3 green balls in a row."
