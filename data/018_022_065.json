    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference B ∆ A. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nB ∆ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {3}\n\nSo, B ∆ A = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A × (B ∆ A) and (B ∆ A) × A.\n\nA × (B ∆ A) = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ (B ∆ A)}\n\nA × (B ∆ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\n(B ∆ A) × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ (B ∆ A), a ∈ A}\n\n(B ∆ A) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nComparing the two sets:\n\nA × (B ∆ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\n(B ∆ A) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nWe can see that A × (B ∆ A) is not equal to (B ∆ A) × A, as there are different ordered pairs in each set. For example, (1, 3) is in (B ∆ A) × A but not in A × (B ∆ A), and (3, 1) is in A × (B ∆ A) but not in (B ∆ A) × A."
