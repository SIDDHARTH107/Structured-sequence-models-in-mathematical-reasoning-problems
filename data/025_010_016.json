    "message_2": "First, let's find the degree of the line bundle $L(D)$ associated with the divisor $D$. The degree of a divisor is the sum of its coefficients. In this case, the divisor $D = 2P + 3Q$, so the degree of $L(D)$ is $2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nNext, we want to find the dimension of the space of global sections $h^0(X, D)$. To do this, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem, which states that for a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g$ and a divisor $D$ on $X$:\n\n$h^0(X, D) - h^1(X, D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nIn our case, $g = 2$ and $\\deg(D) = 5$. We want to find $h^0(X, D)$, so we need to determine $h^1(X, D)$. By Serre duality, we have:\n\n$h^1(X, D) = h^0(X, K - D)$\n\nwhere $K$ is the canonical divisor on $X$. For a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$, the degree of the canonical divisor is $2g - 2$. In our case, $g = 2$, so $\\deg(K) = 2(2) - 2 = 2$. Thus, $K - D$ has degree $2 - 5 = -3$.\n\nSince the degree of $K - D$ is negative, there are no non-zero global sections, so $h^0(X, K - D) = 0$. Therefore, $h^1(X, D) = 0$.\n\nNow we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to find $h^0(X, D)$:\n\n$h^0(X, D) - 0 = 5 + 1 - 2$\n\n$h^0(X, D) = 4$\n\nSo the dimension of the space of global sections $h^0(X, D)$ is 4."
