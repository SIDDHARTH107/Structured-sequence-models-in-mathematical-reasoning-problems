    "message_1": "A bus company has 3 buses and each bus can accommodate 50 passengers. The company expects 200 passengers to travel on a trip. However, there is a 10% chance that each passenger will not show up for the trip. If a passenger shows up, there is a 5% chance that they will cancel during the journey. What is the probability that all the 200 passengers will be accommodated on the trip without any cancellations?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the probability that exactly 150 passengers show up for the trip, since the buses can accommodate a total of 3 * 50 = 150 passengers.\n\nThe probability that a passenger shows up is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 (90% chance). We can use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of exactly 150 passengers showing up:\n\nP(X = 150) = C(200, 150) * (0.90)^150 * (0.10)^50, where C(200, 150) is the number of combinations of choosing 150 passengers from 200.\n\nP(X = 150) ≈ 0.0293 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that none of the 150 passengers who showed up will cancel during the journey. The probability that a passenger does not cancel is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 (95% chance).\n\nThe probability that all 150 passengers do not cancel is (0.95)^150 ≈ 0.0060 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nFinally, we multiply the probability of exactly 150 passengers showing up and the probability that none of them cancel:\n\nP(All 200 passengers accommodated without cancellations) = P(X = 150) * P(No cancellations) ≈ 0.0293 * 0.0060 ≈ 0.000176 (rounded to six decimal places)\n\nSo, the probability that all the 200 passengers will be accommodated on the trip without any cancellations is approximately 0.000176 or 0.0176%."
