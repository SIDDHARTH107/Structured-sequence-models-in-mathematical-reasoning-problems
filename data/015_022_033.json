    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = a * x(t - d) / (1 + x(t - d)^c) - b * x(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the variable of interest, a, b, c, and d are parameters, and t is time. To find the equilibrium point, we need to set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x(t).\n\n0 = a * x(t - d) / (1 + x(t - d)^c) - b * x(t)\n\nWe are given the parameters a=0.2, b=0.1, c=10, and d=0.1. Since we are looking for the equilibrium point, we can assume that x(t) is constant, which means x(t) = x(t - d). Let's denote this constant value as x_eq. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = a * x_eq / (1 + x_eq^c) - b * x_eq\n\nNow, we can plug in the given parameter values:\n\n0 = 0.2 * x_eq / (1 + x_eq^10) - 0.1 * x_eq\n\nTo solve for x_eq, we can first factor out x_eq:\n\n0 = x_eq * (0.2 / (1 + x_eq^10) - 0.1)\n\nSince x_eq = 0 is a trivial solution (no activity), we are interested in the non-trivial solution. Thus, we can set the term inside the parentheses equal to zero:\n\n0.2 / (1 + x_eq^10) - 0.1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x_eq:\n\n0.1 = 0.2 / (1 + x_eq^10)\n\n1 + x_eq^10 = 0.2 / 0.1\n\n1 + x_eq^10 = 2\n\nx_eq^10 = 1\n\nx_eq = 1^(1/10)\n\nx_eq = 1\n\nSo, the value of the equilibrium point for the given Mackey-Glass equation with parameters a=0.2, b=0.1, c=10, and d=0.1 is x_eq = 1."
