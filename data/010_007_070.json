Determine the fundamental group of $X$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of $X$, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. We will decompose $X$ into two open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $U \\cap V$ is also open and simply connected, and both $U$ and $V$ have trivial fundamental groups.\n\nLet $U$ be an open set containing the unit circle $S^1$ and a small portion of the two line segments attached to it. Let $V$ be an open set containing the rest of the two line segments and a small portion of the unit circle $S^1$. Then, $U \\cap V$ is an open set containing two disjoint segments of the unit circle $S^1$.\n\nNow, we can see that $U$ deformation retracts onto $S^1$, and $V$ deformation retracts onto a wedge of two circles. Therefore, the fundamental group of $U$ is $\\pi_1(U) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and the fundamental group of $V$ is $\\pi_1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$, where $*$ denotes the free product.\n\nSince $U \\cap V$ is simply connected, its fundamental group is trivial: $\\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\cong \\{1\\}$. Now, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that the fundamental group of $X$ is the amalgamated free product of $\\pi_1(U)$ and $\\pi_1(V)$ over $\\pi_1(U \\cap V)$:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(U) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V)} \\pi_1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} *_{\\{1\\}} (\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}).$$\n\nSince the amalgamation is over the trivial group, the fundamental group of $X$ is just the free product of $\\pi_1(U)$ and $\\pi_1(V)$:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * (\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}).$$\n\nThis is the fundamental group of the space $X$."
