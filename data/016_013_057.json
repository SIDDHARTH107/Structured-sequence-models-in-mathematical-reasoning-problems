    "message_2": "The exact Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nDimension = log(Number of self-similar pieces) / log(Scale factor)\n\nFor the Sierpinski carpet, there are 8 self-similar pieces, and the scale factor is 3. So the dimension is:\n\nDimension = log(8) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.8928\n\nRounded off to two decimal places, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet is approximately 1.89."
