    "message_1": "A data set containing 20 observations has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Suppose we suspect that an outlier may be present in the data set. Determine the maximum value of the data point that can be considered as not being an outlier, assuming that outliers are defined as observations that are more than 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum value of a data point that can be considered as not being an outlier, we will use the definition of outliers as observations that are more than 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean.\n\nMean = 50\nStandard deviation = 10\nOutlier threshold = 2.5 standard deviations\n\nFirst, we need to find the value that is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean:\n\nMaximum value not considered an outlier = Mean + (Outlier threshold * Standard deviation)\nMaximum value not considered an outlier = 50 + (2.5 * 10)\nMaximum value not considered an outlier = 50 + 25\nMaximum value not considered an outlier = 75\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of a data point that can be considered as not being an outlier is 75. Any data point with a value greater than 75 would be considered an outlier."
