    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (also known as the circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven a diameter of 10 meters, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nC = π(10)\nC ≈ 3.14159(10)\nC ≈ 31.4159\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 31.4159 meters."
