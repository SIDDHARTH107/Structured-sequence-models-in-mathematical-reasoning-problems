Find the conformal mapping function $f(z)$ that satisfies this condition, and use it to find where the points $z_1 = -1 + i$ and $z_2 = 2i$ are mapped onto in the upper-half plane.",
    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping function $f(z)$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Map the rectangle onto the unit disk.\n2. Map the unit disk onto the upper-half plane.\n\nStep 1: Map the rectangle onto the unit disk.\n\nWe can use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula for this step. The Schwarz-Christoffel formula is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = A \\int^z \\frac{dz}{(z - z_1)^{c_1}(z - z_2)^{c_2} \\cdots (z - z_n)^{c_n}} + B$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are complex constants, and $z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_n$ are the vertices of the polygon (in this case, the rectangle) with interior angles $\\pi c_1, \\pi c_2, \\dots, \\pi c_n$.\n\nFor our rectangle, the vertices are $z_1 = -1 - 2i, z_2 = -1 + 2i, z_3 = 1 + 2i, z_4 = 1 - 2i$. The interior angles are all $\\pi/2$, so $c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = c_4 = 1/2$. The Schwarz-Christoffel formula becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = A \\int^z \\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{(z - (-1 - 2i))(z - (-1 + 2i))(z - (1 + 2i))(z - (1 - 2i))}} + B$$\n\nLet's choose $A = 1$ and $B = 0$ for simplicity. Then, the mapping function becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = \\int^z \\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{(z + 1 - 2i)(z + 1 + 2i)(z - 1 - 2i)(z - 1 + 2i)}}$$\n\nStep 2: Map the unit disk onto the upper-half plane.\n\nWe can use the Möbius transformation for this step. The Möbius transformation is given by:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d$ are complex constants such that $ad - bc \\neq 0$. To map the unit disk onto the upper-half plane, we can choose $a = 1, b = i, c = 1, d = -i$. Then, the Möbius transformation becomes:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{z + i}{z - i}$$\n\nNow, we can find the overall conformal mapping function by composing the two functions:\n\n$$h(z) = g(f(z))$$\n\nTo find where the points $z_1 = -1 + i$ and $z_2 = 2i$ are mapped onto in the upper-half plane, we can plug them into the conformal mapping function $h(z)$:\n\n$$h(-1 + i) = g(f(-1 + i))$$\n$$h(2i) = g(f(2i))$$\n\nUnfortunately, the integral in the function $f(z)$ does not have a simple closed-form expression, so we cannot find the exact values of $h(-1 + i)$ and $h(2i)$. However, we can approximate these values numerically using software like Mathematica or MATLAB."
