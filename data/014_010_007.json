    "message_1": "In a substitution cipher, each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another letter. If the letter \"A\" is replaced by \"D\", \"B\" is replaced by \"E\", and so on, what letter is \"X\" replaced by in this cipher?",
    "message_2": "In this substitution cipher, each letter is replaced by the letter that is 3 positions ahead in the alphabet. To find the letter that \"X\" is replaced by, we can count 3 positions ahead from \"X\". \n\nThe alphabet sequence is: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nFrom \"X\", counting 3 positions ahead, we get: Y, Z, and then wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet, A.\n\nSo, in this cipher, \"X\" is replaced by \"A\"."
