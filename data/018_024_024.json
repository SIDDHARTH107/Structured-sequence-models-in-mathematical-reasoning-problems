    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of A and B: A ∩ B = {2, 4}\nSymmetric difference of B and A: (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of elements not in the given set. Since we don't have a universal set defined, we can assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}\n\nComplement of A: A' = U - A = {1, 3}\nComplement of B: B' = U - B = {6, 8}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement. If it is distributive, then the following equation should hold true:\n\n(A Δ B)' = A' Δ B'\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference of A' and B':\n\nA' = {1, 3}\nB' = {6, 8}\nA' Δ B' = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\n(A Δ B) = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n(A Δ B)' = U - (A Δ B) = {}\n\nSince (A Δ B)' ≠ A' Δ B', the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
