    "message_2": "To find the measure of each angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines first to find one angle, and then use the Law of Sines to find the other two angles.\n\nLet the triangle have vertices A, B, and C, with side lengths a = 12, b = 15, and c = 8, opposite to the respective vertices. We can use the Law of Cosines to find angle A:\n\ncos(A) = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2 * b * c)\ncos(A) = (15^2 + 8^2 - 12^2) / (2 * 15 * 8)\ncos(A) = (225 + 64 - 144) / 240\ncos(A) = 145 / 240\n\nNow, find the angle A:\nA = arccos(145/240) ≈ 47.46°\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find angle B:\nsin(B) / b = sin(A) / a\nsin(B) = (sin(A) * b) / a\nsin(B) = (sin(47.46°) * 15) / 12\nB = arcsin((sin(47.46°) * 15) / 12) ≈ 78.46°\n\nFinally, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, we can find angle C:\nC = 180° - A - B\nC = 180° - 47.46° - 78.46°\nC ≈ 54.08°\n\nSo, the measures of the angles in the triangle are approximately 47.46°, 78.46°, and 54.08°."
