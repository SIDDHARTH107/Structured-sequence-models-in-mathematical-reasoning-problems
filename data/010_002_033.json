    "message_2": "To show that lim (n->infinity) a_n = 0, we need to prove that for any given ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, the distance d(a_n, 0) < ε.\n\nLet ε > 0 be given. We want to find N such that for all n > N, d(a_n, 0) < ε. Since a_n = 1/n, we have:\n\nd(a_n, 0) = |a_n - 0| = |1/n|\n\nWe want to find N such that for all n > N, |1/n| < ε. Since ε > 0, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\n1/ε < n\n\nNow, let N be any natural number greater than 1/ε. Then, for all n > N:\n\nn > 1/ε\n1/n < ε\n\nThus, for all n > N, d(a_n, 0) = |1/n| < ε.\n\nTherefore, lim (n->infinity) a_n = 0."
