    "message_2": "Let X be a complete intersection of three quadrics in projective 4-space, i.e., X is defined by the vanishing of three homogeneous quadratic polynomials in P^4. Since X is a complete intersection, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to compute its cohomology groups.\n\nLet's denote the projective space by P(V), where V is a 5-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field k. Then, the quadrics are defined by three quadratic forms Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 on V. The intersection X is a projective variety in P(V) of codimension 3.\n\nBy the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the cohomology groups H^i(X, Z) are isomorphic to the cohomology groups H^i(P(V), Z) for i < 2*codim(X) - 1 = 5. Thus, we only need to compute the cohomology groups of the projective space P^4.\n\nThe cohomology ring of projective space P^n is given by H^*(P^n, Z) = Z[h]/(h^{n+1}), where h is the hyperplane class, and the cohomology groups are concentrated in even degrees. In particular, we have:\n\nH^0(P^4, Z) = Z\nH^2(P^4, Z) = Z\nH^4(P^4, Z) = Z\nH^6(P^4, Z) = Z\nH^i(P^4, Z) = 0 for i odd.\n\nNow, by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have:\n\nH^3(X, Z) = H^3(P^4, Z) = 0.\n\nSo, the dimension of the third cohomology group with integer coefficients of X is 0."
