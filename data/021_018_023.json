    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing plant produces two types of products, product A and product B. To produce product A, the plant requires 2 units of raw material X and 1 unit of raw material Y, and to produce product B, it requires 1 unit of raw material X and 3 units of raw material Y. The plant currently has 20 units of raw material X and 15 units of raw material Y. \n\nThe profit per unit of product A is $10, and the profit per unit of product B is $12. \n\nUsing the tabu search algorithm, what is the maximum profit that the company can make by producing the two products, given the available raw materials?",
    "message_2": "The tabu search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization method that is used to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. However, in this case, we can solve the problem using linear programming, which is a more appropriate method for this type of problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 10x + 12y\n\nConstraints (raw materials):\n2x + y <= 20 (raw material X)\nx + 3y <= 15 (raw material Y)\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem graphically by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\n1. 2x + y <= 20\ny <= -2x + 20\n\n2. x + 3y <= 15\ny <= (-1/3)x + 5\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 5), (5, 5), and (10, 0). We can now evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 5) = 10(0) + 12(5) = $60\n3. P(5, 5) = 10(5) + 12(5) = $110\n4. P(10, 0) = 10(10) + 12(0) = $100\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (5, 5), where the company produces 5 units of product A and 5 units of product B, resulting in a profit of $110."
