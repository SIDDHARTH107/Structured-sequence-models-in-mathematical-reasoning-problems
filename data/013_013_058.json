    "message_1": "In a sealed bid first-price auction, two bidders are bidding for a painting. Bidder A values the painting at $5000 and Bidder B values it at $7000. What bid should each bidder submit, assuming they have complete information about each other's valuations, in order to maximize their chances of winning the auction? The highest bidder wins the painting and pays the amount they bid.",
    "message_2": "In a sealed bid first-price auction with complete information about each other's valuations, bidders will try to submit a bid slightly higher than their opponent's valuation to maximize their chances of winning the auction while minimizing the amount they have to pay.\n\nBidder A knows that Bidder B values the painting at $7000, so in order to maximize their chances of winning, they should submit a bid slightly higher than $7000, say $7001.\n\nBidder B knows that Bidder A values the painting at $5000, so in order to maximize their chances of winning, they should submit a bid slightly higher than $5000, say $5001.\n\nHowever, since Bidder A's maximum bid of $7001 is higher than Bidder B's maximum bid of $5001, Bidder A will win the auction by bidding $7001. But it's important to note that Bidder A is paying more than their own valuation of the painting, which may not be an ideal outcome for them."
