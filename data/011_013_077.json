    "message_1": "A sports team has 10 players, and they need to choose 4 players to create a cheering squad. How many different combinations of 4 players can be chosen from the team using Polya's enumeration theorem?",
    "message_2": "Polya's enumeration theorem is not the appropriate method to use for this problem, as it is used for counting the number of distinct colorings of a set under a group of permutations. Instead, we can use the combination formula to solve this problem.\n\nThe combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to be chosen, and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 10 players and k = 4 players to be chosen for the cheering squad. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different combinations of 4 players that can be chosen from the team to create a cheering squad."
