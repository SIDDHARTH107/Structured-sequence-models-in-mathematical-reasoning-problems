    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function x(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity function v(t).\n\nx(t) = 2t^2 + 5t + 1\n\nFirst derivative:\nv(t) = dx/dt = 4t + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 3 seconds. We plug t = 3 into the velocity function:\n\nv(3) = 4(3) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 m/s\n\nThe velocity of the car at t = 3 seconds is 17 m/s.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function x(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the acceleration function a(t).\n\nWe already found the first derivative (velocity function) v(t) = 4t + 5. Now, we find the second derivative:\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(4t + 5)/dt = 4\n\nThe acceleration function a(t) is a constant, 4 m/s². Therefore, the acceleration of the car at t = 3 seconds is also 4 m/s².\n\nIn conclusion, at t = 3 seconds, the car has a velocity of 17 m/s and an acceleration of 4 m/s²."
