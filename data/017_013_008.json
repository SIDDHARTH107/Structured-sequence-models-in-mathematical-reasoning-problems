Determine the possible group structures based on the prime factorization.\n\nThere are two possible group structures for a group of order 18:\n\na) A direct product of two cyclic groups: C_2 × C_9 (where C_n denotes a cyclic group of order n)\nb) A semi-direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 ⋊ C_2\n\n3. Determine the number of non-isomorphic groups for each group structure.\n\na) For the direct product C_2 × C_9, there is only one non-isomorphic group, which is the direct product itself.\nb) For the semi-direct product C_9 ⋊ C_2, we need to consider the action of C_2 on C_9. There are two possible actions: the trivial action and the non-trivial action. The trivial action results in the direct product C_2 × C_9, which we have already counted. The non-trivial action results in a new non-isomorphic group.\n\nSo, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 18: C_2 × C_9 and a semi-direct product C_9 ⋊ C_2 with a non-trivial action."
