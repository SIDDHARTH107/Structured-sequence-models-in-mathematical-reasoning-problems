Check whether the matrix is ill-conditioned, and explain the solution procedure.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the given system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  4 |  9 ]\n[ 5  6  7 | 15 ]\n[ 8  9 10 | 21 ]\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to find the solution.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we'll subtract 2.5 times the first row from the second row and 4 times the first row from the third row.\n\n```\n[  2   3   4 |  9  ]\n[  0  -1.5 -3 | -7.5]\n[  0   0   0 |  0  ]\n```\n\nNotice that we have a row of zeros in the third row. This indicates that the system of equations is either dependent (infinite solutions) or inconsistent (no solution). To determine which case we have, let's continue with the Gaussian elimination.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\n\nSince the third row is all zeros, there is nothing to eliminate. We can now rewrite the matrix as a system of linear equations:\n\n```\n2x + 3y + 4z = 9\n-1.5y - 3z = -7.5\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve the system of linear equations.\n\nWe can see that the third equation is 0 = 0, which is always true. This means that the system is dependent and has infinite solutions. To express the solution, we can solve the second equation for y:\n\n```\ny = (-7.5 + 3z) / -1.5\ny = 5 - 2z\n```\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation and solve for x:\n\n```\n2x + 3(5 - 2z) + 4z = 9\n2x + 15 - 6z + 4z = 9\n2x - 2z = -6\nx - z = -3\nx = z - 3\n```\n\nSo, the general solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = z - 3\ny = 5 - 2z\n```\n\nwhere z can be any real number.\n\nThe matrix is ill-conditioned because the third row is all zeros, which indicates that the system of equations is dependent and has infinite solutions. This means that small changes in the coefficients or the right-hand side of the equations can lead to large changes in the solution, making the system sensitive to numerical errors."
