The researcher has 20 participants, whom they randomly assign to receive either the new drug or a placebo. After 4 weeks, the researcher measures the difference in symptom improvement between the two groups. \n\nThe improvement scores (in %) for the drug group are: \n25, 17, 12, 14, 9, 19, 23, 30, 21, 18.\n\nThe improvement scores (in %) for the placebo group are:\n8, 5, 13, 4, 12, 7, 3, 6, 10, 2.\n\nWhat is the mean difference in improvement scores between the two groups?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean difference in improvement scores between the two groups, we first need to calculate the mean improvement score for each group.\n\nFor the drug group:\nMean = (25 + 17 + 12 + 14 + 9 + 19 + 23 + 30 + 21 + 18) / 10\nMean = 198 / 10\nMean = 19.8\n\nFor the placebo group:\nMean = (8 + 5 + 13 + 4 + 12 + 7 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 2) / 10\nMean = 70 / 10\nMean = 7\n\nNow, we can find the mean difference in improvement scores between the two groups:\nMean difference = Mean (drug group) - Mean (placebo group)\nMean difference = 19.8 - 7\nMean difference = 12.8\n\nThe mean difference in improvement scores between the two groups is 12.8%."
