    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system in matrix form. The given system can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 4 -2  5 |\n    | 1 -1 -1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    |  5 |\n    | -1 |\n\nNow, we will convert the coefficient matrix A into a sparse matrix. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the matrix A is already sparse, as it does not have a significant number of zero elements. So, we can proceed with solving the system using the given matrix A.\n\nTo solve the system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method or the inverse matrix method. Here, we will use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nStep 1: Forward elimination\n\n1. Multiply the first row by 2 and subtract it from the second row:\n\nNew second row: (4 - 4, -2 - 6, 5 - 2) = (0, -8, 3)\n\n2. Multiply the first row by -1 and add it to the third row:\n\nNew third row: (1 - 2, -1 - 3, -1 - 1) = (-1, -4, -2)\n\n3. Divide the third row by -1:\n\nNew third row: (1, 4, 2)\n\n4. Multiply the second row by 1/2 and add it to the third row:\n\nNew third row: (1 - 0, 4 + 4, 2 - 3/2) = (1, 8, 1/2)\n\n5. Divide the third row by 8:\n\nNew third row: (1/8, 1, 1/16)\n\nStep 2: Backward substitution\n\n1. z = 1/16\n\n2. -8y + 3(1/16) = 5 => y = -1\n\n3. 2x + 3(-1) + 1/16 = 11 => x = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 3\ny = -1\nz = 1/16"
