    "message_1": "A zoo has 10 monkeys in their enclosure. The zookeeper observes that every time the zookeepers bring bananas, all the monkeys get excited and start jumping around. However, whenever they bring watermelons, only a few monkeys get excited, while the others just sit and watch. If the zookeepers bring bananas 5 times, how many times would they need to bring watermelons to ensure that all the monkeys get excited at least once?",
    "message_2": "The problem states that all monkeys get excited when bananas are brought, so bringing bananas 5 times will ensure that all monkeys get excited at least once. Therefore, there is no need to bring watermelons to ensure that all the monkeys get excited at least once. The answer is 0 times."
