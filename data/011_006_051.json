    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of x^6 in the expansion of (1+x+x^2+x^3)^4, we will use generating functions. Let's first consider the generating function for the given expression:\n\nG(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)^4\n\nNow, we want to find the coefficient of x^6 in the expansion of G(x). To do this, we can use the convolution property of generating functions. The convolution property states that the coefficient of x^n in the product of two generating functions is the sum of the products of the coefficients of x^k and x^(n-k) for k = 0, 1, ..., n.\n\nIn our case, we have four identical generating functions being multiplied together:\n\nG(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x+x^2+x^3)\n\nTo find the coefficient of x^6, we can consider all possible ways to pick terms from each of the four factors such that their exponents add up to 6. We can represent these possibilities as ordered quadruples (a, b, c, d), where a, b, c, and d are the exponents of x in the terms picked from the first, second, third, and fourth factors, respectively.\n\nThe possible quadruples are:\n\n(0, 0, 3, 3)\n(0, 1, 2, 3)\n(0, 2, 1, 3)\n(0, 3, 0, 3)\n(1, 0, 2, 3)\n(1, 1, 1, 3)\n(1, 2, 0, 3)\n(1, 3, 0, 2)\n(2, 0, 1, 3)\n(2, 1, 0, 3)\n(2, 1, 1, 2)\n(2, 2, 0, 2)\n(3, 0, 0, 3)\n(3, 0, 1, 2)\n(3, 1, 0, 2)\n(3, 1, 1, 1)\n(3, 2, 0, 1)\n(3, 3, 0, 0)\n\nThere are 18 possible quadruples. Since each term in the generating function has a coefficient of 1, the coefficient of x^6 in the expansion of G(x) is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms corresponding to each quadruple. In this case, all coefficients are 1, so the coefficient of x^6 is simply the number of possible quadruples, which is 18.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^6 in the expansion of (1+x+x^2+x^3)^4 is 18."
