    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element in set A.\n\nBy definition, the empty set ∅ has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A. \n\nIn other words, for every element x in the empty set, x is also an element of set A. Since there are no elements in the empty set to contradict this statement, the empty set is a subset of set A.\n\nThus, we have proved that the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A."
