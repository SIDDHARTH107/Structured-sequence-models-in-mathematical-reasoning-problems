    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of each product requires 3 components, X, Y, and Z. The company has a limited amount of components: 900 units of X, 600 units of Y, and 700 units of Z. Product A has a profit of $12 and B has a profit of $15. The company wants to maximize its profit while ensuring that at least 100 units of each product are produced.\n\nFormulate the problem as a robust optimization problem by adding a 20% uncertainty in the availability of components X and Y. Then, solve the problem using robust optimization techniques to find the optimal production levels for products A and B, and the resulting maximum profit.",
    "message_2": "To formulate the problem as a robust optimization problem, we first need to define the variables, constraints, and objective function. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 12x + 15y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Availability of component X: 3x + 2y ≤ 900\n2. Availability of component Y: x + 3y ≤ 600\n3. Availability of component Z: 2x + y ≤ 700\n4. At least 100 units of each product: x ≥ 100, y ≥ 100\n\nNow, we need to add a 20% uncertainty in the availability of components X and Y. Let ΔX and ΔY represent the uncertainty in the availability of components X and Y, respectively.\n\nΔX = 0.2 * 900 = 180\nΔY = 0.2 * 600 = 120\n\nThe robust optimization problem can be formulated as:\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 12x + 15y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Availability of component X: 3x + 2y ≤ (900 - ΔX)\n2. Availability of component Y: x + 3y ≤ (600 - ΔY)\n3. Availability of component Z: 2x + y ≤ 700\n4. At least 100 units of each product: x ≥ 100, y ≥ 100\n\nSubstitute the values of ΔX and ΔY:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 720\n2. x + 3y ≤ 480\n3. 2x + y ≤ 700\n4. x ≥ 100, y ≥ 100\n\nNow, we can solve the problem using robust optimization techniques such as linear programming. Using a linear programming solver, we get the optimal solution:\n\nx = 140\ny = 100\n\nThe optimal production levels for products A and B are 140 and 100 units, respectively. The resulting maximum profit can be calculated as:\n\nMaximum profit = 12x + 15y = 12(140) + 15(100) = 1680 + 1500 = $3180"
