    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface S at point P(2,2,4), we first need to find the partial derivatives of the function with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = z^2 - x^3 - y^3 + 6xy. Then the tangent plane is given by the gradient of F, which is the vector of partial derivatives (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z).\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 6y\n∂F/∂y = -3y^2 + 6x\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point P(2,2,4):\n\n∂F/∂x(P) = -3(2)^2 + 6(2) = -12 + 12 = 0\n∂F/∂y(P) = -3(2)^2 + 6(2) = -12 + 12 = 0\n∂F/∂z(P) = 2(4) = 8\n\nThe gradient of F at point P is (0, 0, 8).\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of the tangent plane equation:\n\nF(x, y, z) - F(2, 2, 4) = ∂F/∂x(P)(x - 2) + ∂F/∂y(P)(y - 2) + ∂F/∂z(P)(z - 4)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz^2 - x^3 - y^3 + 6xy - (4^2 - 2^3 - 2^3 + 6(2)(2)) = 0(x - 2) + 0(y - 2) + 8(z - 4)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nz^2 - x^3 - y^3 + 6xy - 16 = 8(z - 4)\n\nNow, let's solve for z:\n\nz^2 - x^3 - y^3 + 6xy - 16 = 8z - 32\nz^2 - 8z + x^3 + y^3 - 6xy + 16 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface S at point P(2,2,4) is:\n\nz^2 - 8z + x^3 + y^3 - 6xy + 16 = 0"
