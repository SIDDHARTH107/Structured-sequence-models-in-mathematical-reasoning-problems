    "message_1": "A student has to choose between purchasing a laptop that costs $800 or a desktop computer that costs $1000. The laptop has a life expectancy of 4 years and the desktop computer has a life expectancy of 6 years. The student plans to use the device for college studies. Assuming a 5% discount rate, which device is the better option for the student?",
    "message_2": "To determine which device is the better option for the student, we can calculate the present value (PV) of each option using the formula:\n\nPV = C / (1 + r)^t\n\nwhere C is the cost of the device, r is the discount rate, and t is the life expectancy of the device.\n\nFor the laptop:\nPV_laptop = 800 / (1 + 0.05)^4\nPV_laptop = 800 / (1.21550625)\nPV_laptop ≈ 658.16\n\nFor the desktop:\nPV_desktop = 1000 / (1 + 0.05)^6\nPV_desktop = 1000 / (1.340095)\nPV_desktop ≈ 746.22\n\nComparing the present values, the laptop has a lower present value (PV_laptop ≈ 658.16) than the desktop (PV_desktop ≈ 746.22). Therefore, the laptop is the better option for the student considering the 5% discount rate."
