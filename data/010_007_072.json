    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of $X$, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, let's describe the space $X$ more explicitly. Identifying the opposite edges of a square means that we are gluing the left and right edges together and the top and bottom edges together. This results in a space that is topologically equivalent to a torus.\n\nNow, let's apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. We need to choose two open sets $U$ and $V$ that cover the torus and whose intersection $U \\cap V$ is also path-connected. A natural choice for $U$ and $V$ is to take two slightly overlapping \"cylinders\" that wrap around the torus. More precisely, let $U$ be the torus with a small open disk removed from the \"top\" and $V$ be the torus with a small open disk removed from the \"bottom\". Then, $U \\cap V$ is an annulus that wraps around the torus.\n\nThe fundamental group of $U$ is the same as the fundamental group of the torus with a small open disk removed, which is the free group on two generators, say $\\pi_1(U) = \\langle a, b \\rangle$. Similarly, $\\pi_1(V) = \\langle c, d \\rangle$. The intersection $U \\cap V$ is an annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle, so its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(U \\cap V) = \\langle e \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we need to find the homomorphisms induced by the inclusions $i_U: U \\cap V \\to U$ and $i_V: U \\cap V \\to V$. Since $U \\cap V$ is an annulus that wraps around the torus, we can choose a loop in $U \\cap V$ that goes around the \"hole\" in the torus once. This loop is homotopic to the loop that goes around the \"hole\" in $U$ once, so $i_U(e) = a$. Similarly, $i_V(e) = c$.\n\nBy the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, the fundamental group of the torus is given by the free product of $\\pi_1(U)$ and $\\pi_1(V)$ with the relation $i_U(e) = i_V(e)$, or more explicitly:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) = \\langle a, b, c, d \\mid a = c \\rangle.$$\n\nSince $a = c$, we can eliminate $c$ from the presentation and obtain:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) = \\langle a, b, d \\mid \\rangle = \\langle a, b \\rangle.$$\n\nThus, the fundamental group of $X$ is the free group on two generators, which is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a torus:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}.$$"
