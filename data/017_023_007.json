    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find the possible group structures. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. We can use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible structures of Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n1. One 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8 (2^3)\n2. Three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4 (2^2)\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n1. One 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9 (3^2)\n\nNow, we can combine these possibilities to find the possible group structures:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8 and one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9\n2. Three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4 and one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9\n\nFor the first possibility, we have the following options for the 2-Sylow subgroup:\n1.1. Z_8 (cyclic group of order 8)\n1.2. D_4 (dihedral group of order 8)\n1.3. Q_8 (quaternion group of order 8)\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroup, we only have one option:\n1. Z_9 (cyclic group of order 9)\n\nFor the second possibility, we have the following options for the 2-Sylow subgroup:\n2.1. Z_4 x Z_4 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4)\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroup, we again only have one option:\n1. Z_9 (cyclic group of order 9)\n\nNow, we can combine these options to find the possible non-abelian groups of order 72:\n\n1.1.1. Z_8 x Z_9 (cyclic group of order 72) - This is an abelian group, so we discard it.\n1.2.1. D_4 x Z_9 (semidirect product of D_4 and Z_9) - This is a non-abelian group.\n1.3.1. Q_8 x Z_9 (semidirect product of Q_8 and Z_9) - This is a non-abelian group.\n2.1.1. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_9 (direct product of three cyclic groups) - This is an abelian group, so we discard it.\n\nThus, there are two non-abelian groups of order 72, and they are not isomorphic to each other:\n\n1. D_4 x Z_9 (semidirect product of D_4 and Z_9)\n2. Q_8 x Z_9 (semidirect product of Q_8 and Z_9)"
