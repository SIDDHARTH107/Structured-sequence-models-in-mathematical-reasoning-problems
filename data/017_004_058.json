    "message_2": "Yes, G is necessarily isomorphic to either a cyclic group or the direct product of two cyclic groups. We will prove this using the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 25, we can write it as a product of prime powers: 25 = 5^2. Now, we apply the Sylow theorems to G.\n\nBy the first Sylow theorem, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P of G, which is a subgroup of order 5^2 = 25. By the second Sylow theorem, all Sylow 5-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other. However, since the order of G is 25, there can be only one Sylow 5-subgroup of G, which is P. Therefore, P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we know that the order of P is 25, which is a prime power. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of elements in P that are of order 5 is 24. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, which states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nIn this case, P is isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 25 (C_25) or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 (C_5 Ã— C_5). Since G has only one Sylow 5-subgroup, which is P, and P is normal in G, G must be isomorphic to P. Therefore, G is necessarily isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 25 or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
