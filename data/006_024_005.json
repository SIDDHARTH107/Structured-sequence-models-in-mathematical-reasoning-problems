    "message_1": "Suppose a traveler randomly selects a city from a list of 10 potential destinations for their next trip. Five of these cities are in the United States, and five are in other countries. What is the probability that the traveler will select a city in the United States?",
    "message_2": "The probability of selecting a city in the United States can be calculated using the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of cities in the United States, which is 5. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of cities on the list, which is 10.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a city in the United States is:\n\nProbability = 5 / 10 = 1/2 or 0.5\n\nThe probability that the traveler will select a city in the United States is 0.5 or 50%."
