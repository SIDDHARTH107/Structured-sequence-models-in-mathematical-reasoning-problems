    "message_2": "The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root. Since f(z) = z^4 + 4z^3 + 4z + 5 is a polynomial of degree 4, it must have exactly 4 complex roots, counting multiplicities. Liouville's theorem is not needed to determine the number of complex roots in this case."
