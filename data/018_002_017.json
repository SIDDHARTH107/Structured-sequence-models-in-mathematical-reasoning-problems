    "message_2": "To find the intersection of sets A and B, we need to find the elements that are common to both sets. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nThe common elements are 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, the intersection of sets A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the intersection is a subset of both A and B. \n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if set C is a subset of set A, then every element in set C is also an element in set A. The same applies to set B.\n\nLet's check if every element in the intersection (A ∩ B) is also an element in sets A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nElement 3 is in both sets A and B.\nElement 4 is in both sets A and B.\nElement 5 is in both sets A and B.\n\nSince all elements in the intersection (A ∩ B) are also elements in sets A and B, we can conclude that the intersection (A ∩ B) is a subset of both sets A and B."
