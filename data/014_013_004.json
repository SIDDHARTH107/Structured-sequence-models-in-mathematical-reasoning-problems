    "message_2": "To encode the plaintext \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with a 2x2 matrix key, we first need to know the key matrix. Since it's not provided, let's assume a key matrix K:\n\nK = | a  b |\n    | c  d |\n\nNow, we need to convert the plaintext into numeric form using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). For \"MATH\":\n\nM = 12\nA = 0\nT = 19\nH = 7\n\nWe arrange the plaintext in a 2x1 matrix form:\n\nP1 = | 12 |   P2 = | 19 |\n     |  0 |        |  7 |\n\nNow, we multiply the key matrix K with the plaintext matrices P1 and P2:\n\nC1 = K * P1\nC2 = K * P2\n\nThe resulting matrices C1 and C2 will be the numeric form of the ciphertext.\n\nNow, let's decrypt the ciphertext \"GUOG\" using the same key matrix K. First, convert the ciphertext into numeric form:\n\nG = 6\nU = 20\nO = 14\nG = 6\n\nArrange the ciphertext in a 2x1 matrix form:\n\nC1 = |  6 |   C2 = | 14 |\n     | 20 |        |  6 |\n\nTo decrypt, we need to find the inverse of the key matrix K. Let's call it K_inv:\n\nK_inv = (1/determinant(K)) * |  d  -b |\n                              | -c   a |\n\nNow, we multiply K_inv with the ciphertext matrices C1 and C2:\n\nP1 = K_inv * C1\nP2 = K_inv * C2\n\nThe resulting matrices P1 and P2 will be the numeric form of the original plaintext. Convert the numbers back to letters to get the plaintext \"MATH\"."
