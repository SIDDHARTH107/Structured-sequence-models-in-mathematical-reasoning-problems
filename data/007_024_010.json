    "message_2": "To solve the equation 5^x ≡ 7 (mod 11), we will use the method of finding the smallest positive integer x such that the congruence holds true.\n\nWe will start by calculating the powers of 5 modulo 11:\n\n5^1 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n5^3 ≡ 5 * 3 ≡ 15 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n5^4 ≡ 5 * 4 ≡ 20 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n5^5 ≡ 5 * 9 ≡ 45 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can see that 5^5 ≡ 1 (mod 11). This means that for any positive integer k, we have:\n\n5^(5k) ≡ 1^k ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nNow, let's check the powers of 5 between 5^1 and 5^5:\n\n5^6 ≡ 5^(5+1) ≡ 5^5 * 5^1 ≡ 1 * 5 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n5^7 ≡ 5^(5+2) ≡ 5^5 * 5^2 ≡ 1 * 3 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n5^8 ≡ 5^(5+3) ≡ 5^5 * 5^3 ≡ 1 * 4 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n5^9 ≡ 5^(5+4) ≡ 5^5 * 5^4 ≡ 1 * 9 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n5^10 ≡ 5^(5+5) ≡ 5^5 * 5^5 ≡ 1 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nWe can see that 5^x ≡ 7 (mod 11) does not hold true for any of the powers of 5 we have calculated so far. However, we can continue to check the powers of 5 between 5^6 and 5^10:\n\n5^11 ≡ 5^(10+1) ≡ 5^10 * 5^1 ≡ 1 * 5 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n5^12 ≡ 5^(10+2) ≡ 5^10 * 5^2 ≡ 1 * 3 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n5^13 ≡ 5^(10+3) ≡ 5^10 * 5^3 ≡ 1 * 4 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n5^14 ≡ 5^(10+4) ≡ 5^10 * 5^4 ≡ 1 * 9 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n5^15 ≡ 5^(10+5) ≡ 5^10 * 5^5 ≡ 1 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nWe can see that the powers of 5 are repeating in a cycle of length 5 modulo 11. Therefore, there is no solution for x in the equation 5^x ≡ 7 (mod 11)."
