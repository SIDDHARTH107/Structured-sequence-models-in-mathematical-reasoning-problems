The distances (in kilometers) between each pair of cities are given by the following matrix:\n\n|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 0 | 10| 20| 5 | 15|\n| 2 | 10| 0 | 35| 25| 20|\n| 3 | 20| 35| 0 | 30| 10|\n| 4 | 5 | 25| 30| 0 | 20|\n| 5 | 15| 20| 10| 20| 0 |\n\nWhat is the shortest possible route that the salesman can take to visit each city exactly once and return to his starting point? What is the total distance traveled?",
