    "message_2": "To find the total number of handshakes, we can use the formula for combinations, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of people and k is the number of people involved in each handshake (which is 2 in this case).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9)/(2)\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nThere will be 45 handshakes at the party."
