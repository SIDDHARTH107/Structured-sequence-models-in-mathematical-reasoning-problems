    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we need to replace s with jω in the transfer function G(s), where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency. The frequency response is given by G(jω).\n\nG(jω) = (jω + 1) / ((jω)^2 + 2(jω) + 2)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the frequency response at f = 1 Hz. The angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f by the equation ω = 2πf. Therefore, for f = 1 Hz, ω = 2π(1) = 2π.\n\nG(j2π) = (j2π + 1) / ((j2π)^2 + 2(j2π) + 2)\n\nG(j2π) = (j2π + 1) / ((-4π^2) + j(4π) + 2)\n\nTo find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response, we can convert the complex number to polar form. Let's first find the magnitude:\n\n|G(j2π)| = |(j2π + 1) / (-4π^2 + j(4π) + 2)|\n\n|G(j2π)| = √((2π)^2 + 1^2) / √((-4π^2 + 2)^2 + (4π)^2)\n\n|G(j2π)| ≈ 0.1606\n\nNow, let's find the phase:\n\n∠G(j2π) = atan2(Im(G(j2π)), Re(G(j2π)))\n\n∠G(j2π) = atan2(2π, 1) - atan2(4π, -4π^2 + 2)\n\n∠G(j2π) ≈ 1.325 - (-1.107) = 2.432 radians\n\nSo, the frequency response of the system at f = 1 Hz is approximately:\n\nG(j2π) ≈ 0.1606 ∠ 2.432 radians"
