    "message_2": "First, let's recall some basic facts about groups of order 10. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 2) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, there must be 1 or 5 Sylow 2-subgroups. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, there must be 1 Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10:\nIn this case, G is generated by a single element of order 10. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, this subgroup must be normal. Also, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must also be normal. The product of these two normal subgroups is the entire group G, and their intersection is the identity element. Therefore, G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 2 and Sylow 5-subgroups. Since the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, G is abelian, and thus isomorphic to C10.\n\n2. G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5:\nThe dihedral group D5 has 10 elements, consisting of 5 rotations and 5 reflections. The rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 5, which is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. The reflections form 5 distinct subgroups of order 2, which are the Sylow 2-subgroups. Thus, G has 5 Sylow 2-subgroups and 1 Sylow 5-subgroup. Since the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal, G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 2 and Sylow 5-subgroups. However, G is non-abelian in this case.\n\n3. G is a non-abelian group of order 10:\nIf G is non-abelian, then it cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10, which is abelian. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nIn conclusion, G can either be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. If G is abelian, then it is isomorphic to C10. If G is non-abelian, then it is isomorphic to D5. There is no other non-abelian group of order 10."
