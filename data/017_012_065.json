    "message_2": "To determine whether the group G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we need to analyze its properties.\n\n1. Cyclic group C16: A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. In this case, the group G would have an element g such that every other element in G can be written as a power of g. The order of a cyclic group is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e (identity element). If G is isomorphic to C16, it must have an element of order 16.\n\n2. Dihedral group D8: The dihedral group of order 2n, denoted as D_n, is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon. In this case, n = 8, so D8 represents the symmetries of a regular octagon. D8 has 16 elements, consisting of 8 rotations and 8 reflections. It is a non-abelian group, meaning that the group operation is not commutative (i.e., there exist elements a and b in G such that ab â‰  ba).\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 16: A non-abelian group of order 16 is a group with 16 elements and a non-commutative group operation. There are several non-abelian groups of order 16, but we will not go into detail about their structures.\n\nTo determine which of these groups G is isomorphic to, we need more information about the properties of G. For example, if G is abelian (i.e., its group operation is commutative), then it cannot be isomorphic to D8 or any non-abelian group of order 16. If G has an element of order 16, then it is likely isomorphic to C16. If G has no element of order 16 but has elements of order 8, then it might be isomorphic to D8.\n\nWithout more information about the structure and properties of G, we cannot definitively determine which group it is isomorphic to."
