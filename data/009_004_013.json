    "message_2": "To find the period of the resulting harmonic motion, we can use the formula for the period of a spring-mass system:\n\nT = 2π * √(m/k)\n\nwhere T is the period, m is the mass, and k is the spring constant.\n\nGiven the mass m = 0.5 kg and the spring constant k = 50 N/m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nT = 2π * √(0.5 kg / 50 N/m)\n\nT = 2π * √(0.01 s²)\n\nT = 2π * 0.1 s\n\nT = 0.2π s\n\nThe period of the resulting harmonic motion is 0.2π seconds."
