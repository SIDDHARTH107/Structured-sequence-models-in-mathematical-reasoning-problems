    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the given predicate logic statement: \"For all positive integers n, if n is even, then n/2 is also an integer.\"\n\nWe are given that n/2 = 5, and we need to find the value of n. Since 5 is an integer, we can infer that n must be even according to the predicate logic statement.\n\nTo find the value of n, we can set up the equation:\n\nn/2 = 5\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate n:\n\nn = 5 * 2\n\nn = 10\n\nSo, the value of n is 10, which is an even number, and it satisfies the given predicate logic statement."
