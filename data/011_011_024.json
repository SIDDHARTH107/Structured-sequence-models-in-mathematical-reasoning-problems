    "message_1": "There are 10 identical red balls and 5 identical blue balls. In how many ways can they be distributed among 3 distinct boxes such that no box is empty?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. We will first distribute the red balls and then the blue balls.\n\nFor the red balls, since there are 10 identical balls and 3 distinct boxes, and no box can be empty, we can use the stars and bars method. We will have 10 - 3 = 7 \"extra\" balls to distribute among the 3 boxes. We can represent this as 7 stars and 2 bars (to separate the 3 boxes). The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(n + k - 1, k - 1) = C(7 + 2, 2) = C(9, 2) = 9! / (2! * 7!) = 36 ways\n\nNow, for the blue balls, there are 5 identical balls and 3 distinct boxes. Since no box can be empty, we will have 5 - 3 = 2 \"extra\" balls to distribute among the 3 boxes. We can represent this as 2 stars and 2 bars. The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(n + k - 1, k - 1) = C(2 + 2, 2) = C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6 ways\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to distribute both the red and blue balls, we multiply the number of ways for each color:\n\n36 ways (red balls) * 6 ways (blue balls) = 216 ways\n\nSo, there are 216 ways to distribute the 10 red balls and 5 blue balls among the 3 distinct boxes such that no box is empty."
