Christoffel symbols:\nThe Christoffel symbols are given by the formula:\n\nΓ_{ijk} = 1/2 * (g_{ij,k} + g_{ik,j} - g_{jk,i})\n\nwhere g_{ij,k} denotes the partial derivative of g_{ij} with respect to the k-th coordinate.\n\nSince the metric tensor g is constant, all its partial derivatives are zero. Therefore, all Christoffel symbols are also zero:\n\nΓ_{ijk} = 0 for all i, j, k\n\n2. Riemann curvature tensor:\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is given by the formula:\n\nR_{ijkl} = ∂Γ_{ikl}/∂x^j - ∂Γ_{ijl}/∂x^k + Γ_{ijm}Γ_{mkl} - Γ_{ikm}Γ_{mjl}\n\nSince all Christoffel symbols are zero, the Riemann curvature tensor is also zero:\n\nR_{ijkl} = 0 for all i, j, k, l\n\n3. Ricci tensor:\nThe Ricci tensor is obtained by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor:\n\nR_{ij} = R^k_{ikj}\n\nSince the Riemann curvature tensor is zero, the Ricci tensor is also zero:\n\nR_{ij} = 0 for all i, j\n\n4. Scalar curvature:\nThe scalar curvature is obtained by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric tensor g^{ij}:\n\nR = g^{ij}R_{ij}\n\nSince the Ricci tensor is zero, the scalar curvature is also zero:\n\nR = 0\n\nTherefore, the scalar curvature of M at the point (1,1,1) is 0."
