    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nLet's assume the universal set U contains the elements from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now, we can find the complement of set A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's prove that the complement is unique. Suppose there is another complement of set A, denoted as B, such that B ≠ A'. Since B is a complement of A, it must satisfy the following properties:\n\n1. A ∩ B = Ø (A and B have no common elements)\n2. A ∪ B = U (A and B together form the universal set)\n\nNow, let's compare A' and B:\n\n1. A' ∩ A = Ø (by definition of complement)\n2. A' ∪ A = U (by definition of complement)\n\nSince both A' and B satisfy the same properties with respect to set A, it must be the case that B = A'. Therefore, the complement of set A is unique, and in this case, A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}."
