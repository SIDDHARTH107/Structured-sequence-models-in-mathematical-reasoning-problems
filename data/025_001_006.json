    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem based on Bezout's theorem and its application:\n\n\"Find the number of points at which the two algebraic curves given by the equations y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 4 and y = -x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 2 intersect.\"\n\nThe student can solve this problem using Bezout's theorem, which states that the intersection points of two algebraic curves can be found by computing the product of their degrees. In this case, the degrees of the two curves are both 3, so their product is 9. Therefore, the curves intersect at exactly 9 points. The student can then go on to find the coordinates of these points by solving the system of equations formed by equating the two given algebraic curves.",
    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the intersection points, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 4 = -x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 2\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\n2x^3 + 6x^2 - 6x - 6 = 0\n\nNow, we can divide the equation by 2 to simplify it:\n\nx^3 + 3x^2 - 3x - 3 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-3) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). The possible rational roots are ±1, ±3.\n\nBy testing these possible roots, we find that x = 1 is a root:\n\n(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 - 3(1) - 3 = 1 + 3 - 3 - 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 + 3x^2 - 3x - 3) / (x - 1)\n\nThe result is:\n\nx^2 + 4x + 3\n\nNow, we can find the remaining roots by factoring or using the quadratic formula:\n\nx^2 + 4x + 3 = (x + 1)(x + 3)\n\nSo, the roots are x = -1 and x = -3.\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinates of the intersection points, we can find the corresponding y-coordinates by plugging these values back into either of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:\n\nFor x = 1:\ny = (1)^3 + 2(1)^2 - 3(1) - 4 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 4 = -4\n\nFor x = -1:\ny = (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 3(-1) - 4 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 0\n\nFor x = -3:\ny = (-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 - 3(-3) - 4 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 4 = -4\n\nSo, the intersection points are (1, -4), (-1, 0), and (-3, -4). Note that we found only 3 intersection points instead of the 9 points predicted by Bezout's theorem. This discrepancy occurs because Bezout's theorem counts intersection points with multiplicity and intersection points at infinity. In this case, the theorem overestimates the number of intersection points in the finite plane."
