    "message_1": "A dictator decides to distribute $100 among themselves and a second person. The dictator proposes two options to the second person: accept the offer or reject it. \nIf the second person accepts the offer, both players keep their respective portions of the $100 as proposed. \nIf the second person rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. \n\nWhat is the minimum amount the dictator can offer to the second person, ensuring that the second person will accept the offer rather than reject it?",
    "message_2": "The minimum amount the dictator can offer to the second person, ensuring that the second person will accept the offer rather than reject it, is $1. This is because receiving $1 is still better than receiving nothing, so the second person would be more likely to accept the offer."
