    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nIntersection of A and B: A ∩ B = {5, 7}\nSymmetric difference of A and B: A Δ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 3, 9} ∪ {2, 4, 8} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the result with A:\n(A Δ B) ∩ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} ∩ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} = {1, 3, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and the intersection of A and B:\nA Δ (A ∩ B) = A Δ {5, 7} = (A - {5, 7}) ∪ ({5, 7} - A) = {1, 3, 9} ∪ {} = {1, 3, 9}\n\nAs we can see, the result of finding the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with A is the same as finding the symmetric difference of A and the intersection of A and B. Both results are {1, 3, 9}."
