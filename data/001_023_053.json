    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + 3cos(x) = 1, we can use the following substitution method:\n\nLet's set:\nu = sin(x)\nv = cos(x)\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n2u + 3v = 1\n\nWe also know that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, so:\nu^2 + v^2 = 1\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n1) 2u + 3v = 1\n2) u^2 + v^2 = 1\n\nWe can solve for u in equation (1):\nu = (1 - 3v)/2\n\nNow substitute this expression for u in equation (2):\n((1 - 3v)/2)^2 + v^2 = 1\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n(1 - 6v + 9v^2)/4 + v^2 = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n1 - 6v + 9v^2 + 4v^2 = 4\n\nCombine like terms:\n13v^2 - 6v - 3 = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation. We can solve for v using the quadratic formula:\nv = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 13, b = -6, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nv = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(13)(-3))) / (2(13))\n\nv = (6 ± √(36 + 156)) / 26\n\nv = (6 ± √192) / 26\n\nNow we have two possible values for v:\nv1 = (6 + √192) / 26\nv2 = (6 - √192) / 26\n\nFor each value of v, we can find the corresponding value of u using the expression we found earlier:\nu = (1 - 3v)/2\n\nFor v1:\nu1 = (1 - 3v1)/2\n\nFor v2:\nu2 = (1 - 3v2)/2\n\nNow, we have two pairs of (u, v) values. Since u = sin(x) and v = cos(x), we can find the corresponding angles x using the inverse trigonometric functions:\n\nFor (u1, v1):\nx1 = arctan(u1/v1)\n\nFor (u2, v2):\nx2 = arctan(u2/v2)\n\nMake sure to check if x1 and x2 are in the range of 0 to 2π radians. If not, add or subtract 2π until they are in the desired range.\n\nThese two values of x, x1 and x2, are the solutions to the original equation 2sin(x) + 3cos(x) = 1 in the range of 0 to 2π radians."
