    "message_1": "Alice has 5 different books that are to be arranged on a shelf. In how many ways can she arrange them such that two particular books are always together?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can treat the two particular books that must be together as a single unit. So now, Alice has 4 units to arrange: the 3 individual books and the pair of books that must be together.\n\nThere are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange these 4 units, which is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the arrangement of the two particular books within their pair. There are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange these two books, which is 2 × 1 = 2 ways.\n\nSo, to find the total number of ways Alice can arrange the 5 books with the two particular books always together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 4 units by the number of ways to arrange the two particular books within their pair:\n\n24 (ways to arrange 4 units) × 2 (ways to arrange the pair) = 48 ways."
