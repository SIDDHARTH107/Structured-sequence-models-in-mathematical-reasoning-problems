    "message_2": "To find the trend equation, we will use the method of least squares. We will fit a linear trend equation of the form:\n\nY = a + bX\n\nWhere Y is the sales, X is the time period (month), a is the intercept, and b is the slope.\n\nFirst, let's assign numerical values to the months:\n\nMonth | Month Number (X) | Sales (Y)\n:----:|:---------------:|:-------:\nJanuary | 1 | 20\nFebruary | 2 | 22\nMarch | 3 | 25\nApril | 4 | 24\nMay | 5 | 26\nJune | 6 | 28\nJuly | 7 | 30\nAugust | 8 | 32\nSeptember | 9 | 35\nOctober | 10 | 36\nNovember | 11 | 38\nDecember | 12 | 40\n\nNow, we need to calculate the following values:\n\nΣX = 1+2+3+...+12 = 78\nΣY = 20+22+25+...+40 = 366\nΣX² = 1²+2²+3²+...+12² = 650\nΣXY = (1*20)+(2*22)+...+(12*40) = 3014\n\nNext, we will use the formulas for a and b:\n\nn = number of data points = 12\n\nb = (nΣXY - ΣXΣY) / (nΣX² - (ΣX)²) = (12*3014 - 78*366) / (12*650 - 78²) = 2\n\na = (ΣY - bΣX) / n = (366 - 2*78) / 12 = 15\n\nSo, the trend equation is:\n\nY = 15 + 2X\n\nb) To forecast the sales for the next two months, we will use the trend equation and plug in the values for the next two months:\n\nMonth 13 (January next year):\nY = 15 + 2(13) = 15 + 26 = 41 (thousand pairs)\n\nMonth 14 (February next year):\nY = 15 + 2(14) = 15 + 28 = 43 (thousand pairs)\n\nThus, the forecasted sales for the next two months are 41,000 and 43,000 pairs of shoes, respectively."
