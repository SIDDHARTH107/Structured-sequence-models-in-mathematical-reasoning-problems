    "message_1": "A rectangular garden has a perimeter of 36 meters. The length of the garden is 4 meters more than twice the width. What are the dimensions of the garden that maximize the area?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the width of the garden as w and the length as l. We are given that the perimeter is 36 meters, and the length is 4 meters more than twice the width. We can write these as:\n\nPerimeter = 2l + 2w = 36\nLength = l = 2w + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that maximize the area. The area of a rectangle is given by:\n\nArea = l * w\n\nWe can substitute the expression for l from the second equation into the area equation:\n\nArea = (2w + 4) * w\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of this quadratic function. To do this, we can find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex (w-coordinate in this case) is given by:\n\nw = -b / 2a\n\nIn our quadratic function, a = 2 and b = 4:\n\nw = -4 / (2 * 2) = -4 / 4 = -1\n\nHowever, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the width cannot be negative. This means that the maximum area occurs at one of the endpoints of the domain. Since the perimeter is 36, the maximum width can be 36/4 = 9 meters (when the length is also 9 meters, making it a square). \n\nSo, we have two possible cases: \n\n1) w = 0 (not a valid solution, as it would mean there is no garden)\n2) w = 9\n\nFor the second case, we can find the length using the equation l = 2w + 4:\n\nl = 2(9) + 4 = 18 + 4 = 22\n\nThus, the dimensions that maximize the area of the garden are width = 9 meters and length = 22 meters."
