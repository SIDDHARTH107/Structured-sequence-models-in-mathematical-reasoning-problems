    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold that can be covered by two open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $U \\cap V$ is non-empty and contractible. The De Rham cohomology group $H^k(M)$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of the De Rham cohomology groups $H^k(U)$ and $H^k(V)$. Suppose that $H^1(U) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $H^1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$. What is the dimension of the De Rham cohomology group $H^1(M)$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of $H^1(M)$, we will use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for De Rham cohomology. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is a long exact sequence that relates the cohomology of a space to the cohomology of two of its open covers. In our case, the sequence looks like:\n\n$$\n\\cdots \\to H^0(M) \\to H^0(U) \\oplus H^0(V) \\to H^0(U \\cap V) \\to H^1(M) \\to H^1(U) \\oplus H^1(V) \\to H^1(U \\cap V) \\to \\cdots\n$$\n\nSince $U \\cap V$ is contractible, its De Rham cohomology groups are trivial for $k > 0$, i.e., $H^k(U \\cap V) = 0$ for $k > 0$. This implies that the map $H^1(M) \\to H^1(U) \\oplus H^1(V)$ is an isomorphism.\n\nNow, we are given that $H^1(U) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $H^1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, the direct sum $H^1(U) \\oplus H^1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^5$. Since the map $H^1(M) \\to H^1(U) \\oplus H^1(V)$ is an isomorphism, we have $H^1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the De Rham cohomology group $H^1(M)$ is 5."
