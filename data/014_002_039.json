Alice has a prime number modulus of 17 and a base of 3, while Bob has a modulus of 17 and a base of 5. If Alice's private key is 4 and Bob's private key is 8, what is the shared secret key that they will use for encryption?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we first need to calculate the public keys for both Alice and Bob.\n\nAlice's public key (A) can be calculated using the formula: A = (base^private_key) % modulus\nA = (3^4) % 17\nA = 81 % 17\nA = 13\n\nBob's public key (B) can be calculated using the same formula:\nB = (5^8) % 17\nB = 390625 % 17\nB = 1\n\nNow, both Alice and Bob will use each other's public keys and their own private keys to compute the shared secret key.\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = (B^private_key) % modulus\nS = (1^4) % 17\nS = 1 % 17\nS = 1\n\nBob computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = (A^private_key) % modulus\nS = (13^8) % 17\nS = 815730721 % 17\nS = 1\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key, which is 1. They will use this key for encryption."
