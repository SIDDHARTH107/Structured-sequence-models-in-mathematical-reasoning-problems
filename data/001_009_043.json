    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power.\n\nIn this case, we have two like terms with the variable x (3x and -4x) and two like terms with the variable y (2y and -3y).\n\nTo combine the like terms, we add or subtract their coefficients:\n\n3x - 4x = -1x\n2y - 3y = -1y\n\nNow, we can rewrite the simplified expression:\n\n-1x - 1y\n\nOr, more simply:\n\n-x - y"
