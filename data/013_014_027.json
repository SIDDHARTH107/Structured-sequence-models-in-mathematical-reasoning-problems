    "message_1": "A charity organization is selling a painting worth $10,000 in a public auction. There are three bidders interested in the painting: bidder A, bidder B, and bidder C. Each bidder has a private valuation for the painting and is willing to pay up to that amount only. Bidder A's valuation is $12,000, bidder B's valuation is $9,000, and bidder C's valuation is $8,000. The auction is a sealed-bid auction, meaning that each bidder submits their bid in a sealed envelope, and the highest bidder wins the painting and pays their bid amount. However, the charity organization wants to ensure that the winning bidder actually pays their bid amount, so they decide to implement a mechanism that penalizes a bidder who wins the auction but fails to pay their bid amount. The mechanism works as follows: the bid amount of the winning bidder is multiplied by 0.75, and this new amount is paid to the charity organization. If the winning bidder fails to pay this new amount, they are banned from participating in any future auctions held by the organization. \n\nWhat bid amount will each bidder submit to maximize their expected utility?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid auction, bidders typically submit bids below their private valuations to maximize their expected utility. This is because they want to balance the probability of winning the auction with the surplus they can get from the difference between their valuation and the bid amount. In this case, the penalty mechanism does not change the optimal bidding strategy, as it only affects the winning bidder if they fail to pay their bid amount.\n\nTo maximize their expected utility, each bidder should submit a bid slightly below their private valuation, but above the highest valuation of the other bidders. \n\nBidder A should submit a bid slightly above $9,000, as they know bidder B's valuation is $9,000 and bidder C's valuation is $8,000. By bidding slightly above $9,000, bidder A ensures they win the auction while maximizing their surplus.\n\nBidder B should submit a bid slightly above $8,000, as they know bidder C's valuation is $8,000. By bidding slightly above $8,000, bidder B maximizes their chance of winning the auction if bidder A submits a bid below their valuation.\n\nBidder C has the lowest valuation and cannot submit a bid above their valuation to maximize their expected utility. They should submit a bid equal to or slightly below their valuation of $8,000, as they cannot outbid the other bidders without overpaying for the painting.\n\nIn summary, the optimal bid amounts for each bidder to maximize their expected utility are:\n\n- Bidder A: slightly above $9,000\n- Bidder B: slightly above $8,000\n- Bidder C: equal to or slightly below $8,000"
