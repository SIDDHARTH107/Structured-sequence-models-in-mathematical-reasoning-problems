    "message_1": "A plane is flying due north at 300 miles per hour. The velocity of the wind is towards the northwest at 50 miles per hour. What is the resultant speed and direction of the plane? Use trigonometry to find the cross product of the velocity and wind vectors.",
    "message_2": "To find the resultant speed and direction of the plane, we need to first break down the wind velocity into its north and west components. Since the wind is blowing towards the northwest, it forms a 45-degree angle with both the north and west directions.\n\nUsing trigonometry, we can find the north and west components of the wind velocity:\n\nNorth component = 50 * cos(45°) = 50 * (1/√2) ≈ 35.36 mph\nWest component = 50 * sin(45°) = 50 * (1/√2) ≈ 35.36 mph\n\nNow, we can find the resultant velocity of the plane by adding the north component of the wind velocity to the plane's northward velocity and considering the west component of the wind velocity:\n\nResultant north velocity = 300 (plane's northward velocity) + 35.36 (north component of wind velocity) ≈ 335.36 mph\nResultant west velocity = 35.36 mph (west component of wind velocity)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nResultant speed = √(Resultant north velocity² + Resultant west velocity²)\nResultant speed = √(335.36² + 35.36²) ≈ √(112470.73) ≈ 335.37 mph\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nDirection = arctan(Resultant west velocity / Resultant north velocity)\nDirection = arctan(35.36 / 335.36) ≈ 6.02°\n\nThe direction is approximately 6.02° west of north. Therefore, the resultant speed and direction of the plane are approximately 335.37 mph and 6.02° west of north."
