    "message_2": "To determine the homotopy class of the map $f(z) = z^2$, we will first compute the degree of the map and then use this information to describe the path-component of continuous maps from $S^1$ to itself that contain $f$.\n\nThe degree of a continuous map $f: S^1 \\to S^1$ is an integer that describes the \"winding number\" of the map, or how many times the image of the circle wraps around the target circle. In this case, we can compute the degree of $f(z) = z^2$ by considering the change in the argument of $z$ as it traverses the unit circle.\n\nLet $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$ and $0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi$. Then $f(z) = e^{2i\\theta}$. As $\\theta$ increases from $0$ to $2\\pi$, the argument of $f(z)$ increases from $0$ to $4\\pi$. This means that the image of the unit circle under $f$ wraps around the target circle twice, so the degree of $f$ is 2.\n\nNow, we want to describe the path-component of continuous maps from $S^1$ to itself that contain $f$. Two maps are in the same path-component if they are homotopic, meaning there exists a continuous deformation between them. Since the degree is a homotopy invariant, all maps in the path-component of $f$ must also have degree 2.\n\nThus, the homotopy class of the map $f(z) = z^2$ consists of all continuous maps $g: S^1 \\to S^1$ with degree 2. In other words, the path-component of continuous maps from $S^1$ to itself that contain $f$ consists of maps that wrap around the target circle twice, just like $f$."
