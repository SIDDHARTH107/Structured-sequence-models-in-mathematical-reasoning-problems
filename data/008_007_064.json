    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we first need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = \n[ 2-λ  1   ]\n[  1   2-λ ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is (2-λ)(2-λ) - 1*1 = λ^2 - 4λ + 4 - 1 = λ^2 - 4λ + 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this equation:\n\nλ^2 - 4λ + 3 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored as (λ - 3)(λ - 1) = 0. Therefore, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = 1.\n\nNext, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 3:\n\n(A - λ1I) * v1 = 0\n[ -1  1 ] [ x1 ]   [ 0 ]\n[  1  -1 ] [ x2 ]   [ 0 ]\n\nFrom the first row, we get x1 = x2. We can choose x1 = 1, so x2 = 1. Thus, the eigenvector v1 is [1, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 1:\n\n(A - λ2I) * v2 = 0\n[ 1  1 ] [ x1 ]   [ 0 ]\n[ 1  1 ] [ x2 ]   [ 0 ]\n\nFrom the first row, we get x1 = -x2. We can choose x1 = 1, so x2 = -1. Thus, the eigenvector v2 is [1, -1].\n\nNow, we can diagonalize the matrix A using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The diagonal matrix D consists of the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nD = \n[ 3  0 ]\n[ 0  1 ]\n\nThe matrix P consists of the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = \n[  1  1 ]\n[  1 -1 ]\n\nTo verify the diagonalization, we can compute P^(-1) * A * P:\n\nP^(-1) = 1/(-2) * \n[ -1 -1 ]\n[ -1  1 ]\n\nP^(-1) * A * P = 1/(-2) *\n[ -1 -1 ] [ 2  1 ] [  1  1 ]\n[ -1  1 ] [ 1  2 ] [  1 -1 ]\n\n= 1/(-2) *\n[ -1 -1 ] [ 3  1 ]\n[ -1  1 ] [ 1  3 ]\n\n= 1/(-2) *\n[ -4  2 ]\n[ -2  4 ]\n\n= \n[ 2  -1 ]\n[ 1  -2 ]\n\nThus, we have successfully diagonalized the matrix A as P^(-1) * A * P = D."
