    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 2^(x+1) = 16, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation with the same base on both sides. Since 16 can be written as 2^4, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^(x+1) = 2^4\n\n2. Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 1 = 4\n\n3. Solve for x:\n\nx = 4 - 1\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution for the exponential equation 2^(x+1) = 16 is x = 3."
