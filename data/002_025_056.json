    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of equal length, with each side measuring 5 cm. If the third side of the triangle measures 8 cm, what is the length of the altitude drawn from the vertex opposite the base?",
    "message_2": "Since the triangle has two sides of equal length (5 cm each), it is an isosceles triangle. Let's call the equal sides A and B, and the base C (8 cm). The altitude drawn from the vertex opposite the base will bisect the base, creating two right triangles.\n\nLet's call the length of the altitude h, and the length of the bisected base x. Now we have two right triangles with legs x and h, and hypotenuse 5 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write the equation:\n\nx^2 + h^2 = 5^2\n\nSince the base is bisected, x = 8/2 = 4 cm. Now we can plug in the value of x into the equation:\n\n4^2 + h^2 = 5^2\n16 + h^2 = 25\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh^2 = 25 - 16\nh^2 = 9\nh = âˆš9\nh = 3 cm\n\nSo, the length of the altitude drawn from the vertex opposite the base is 3 cm."
