    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other variable. Let's solve the second equation for y:\n\n3x - y = 5\ny = 3x - 5\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n5x + 2(3x - 5) = 13\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n5x + 6x - 10 = 13\n11x = 23\nx = 23/11\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we will substitute it back into the expression for y:\n\ny = 3(23/11) - 5\ny = 69/11 - 55/11\ny = 14/11\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 23/11 and y = 14/11."
