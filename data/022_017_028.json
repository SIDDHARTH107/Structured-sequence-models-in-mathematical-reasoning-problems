    "message_2": "To find the values of $r$ for which $y(x) = e^{rx}$ is a solution to the given differential equation, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of $y(x)$ with respect to $x$.\n\nFirst derivative:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(e^{rx}) = re^{rx}$$\n\nSecond derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}(re^{rx}) = r^2e^{rx}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these derivatives into the given differential equation:\n\n$$r^2e^{rx} + 2re^{rx} + 5e^{rx} = 0$$\n\nWe can factor out the common term $e^{rx}$:\n\n$$e^{rx}(r^2 + 2r + 5) = 0$$\n\nSince $e^{rx}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by $e^{rx}$:\n\n$$r^2 + 2r + 5 = 0$$\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in terms of $r$. To find the roots of this equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn our case, $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}$$\n\n$$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-16}}{2}$$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots:\n\n$$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm 4i}{2}$$\n\nSo, the values of $r$ for which $y(x) = e^{rx}$ is a solution to the differential equation are:\n\n$$r_1 = -1 + 2i$$\n$$r_2 = -1 - 2i$$"
