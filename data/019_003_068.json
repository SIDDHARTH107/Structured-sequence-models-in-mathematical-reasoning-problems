However, here's a question related to Modal Logic that you can use as a reference:\n\nConsider the following two statements:\n\n1. It is necessary that 2+2=4.\n\n2. It is possible that 2+2=5.\n\nUsing modal logic, determine whether each of these statements is true or false.",
    "message_2": "In modal logic, we use the concepts of necessity and possibility to evaluate statements. Let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. It is necessary that 2+2=4.\nThis statement is true. In the context of standard arithmetic, 2+2 always equals 4. This is a necessary truth, meaning it holds in all possible worlds or scenarios.\n\n2. It is possible that 2+2=5.\nThis statement is false. In the context of standard arithmetic, 2+2 can never equal 5. There is no possible world or scenario where this statement would be true.\n\nSo, using modal logic, the first statement is true, and the second statement is false."
