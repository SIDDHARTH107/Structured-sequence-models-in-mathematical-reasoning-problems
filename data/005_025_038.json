    "message_2": "To construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students who prefer online learning in the entire college population, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = p-hat ± Z * sqrt((p-hat * (1-p-hat)) / n)\n\nwhere:\n- p-hat is the sample proportion (70/100)\n- Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\n- n is the sample size (100)\n\nFirst, calculate p-hat:\n\np-hat = 70/100 = 0.7\n\nNext, calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = sqrt((0.7 * (1-0.7)) / 100) = sqrt(0.21/100) = 0.0458\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.0458 = 0.0897\n\nFinally, construct the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 0.7 ± 0.0897\nLower Bound = 0.7 - 0.0897 = 0.6103\nUpper Bound = 0.7 + 0.0897 = 0.7897\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students who prefer online learning in the entire college population is (0.6103, 0.7897)."
