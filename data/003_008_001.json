    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: (1/2) * base * height. We can find the base and height using the sine and cosine functions of the given angle.\n\nLet's call the side adjacent to the 35-degree angle the base (b) and the side opposite the 35-degree angle the height (h).\n\nUsing the sine function:\nsin(35) = h / 10\nh = 10 * sin(35)\n\nUsing the cosine function:\ncos(35) = b / 10\nb = 10 * cos(35)\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of the triangle:\nArea = (1/2) * b * h\n\nFirst, let's find the values of h and b:\nh = 10 * sin(35) ≈ 5.74 cm\nb = 10 * cos(35) ≈ 8.19 cm\n\nNow, we can find the area:\nArea = (1/2) * 8.19 * 5.74 ≈ 23.52 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 23.52 cm²."
