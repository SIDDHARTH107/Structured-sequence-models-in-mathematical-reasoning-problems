    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem dealing with Prisoner's Dilemma in Game Theory for a math student to solve:\n\nTwo suspects are arrested and are being interrogated separately. The district attorney has evidence to charge them with a minor offense, but would like to charge them with a more serious offense. The district attorney offers each of the suspects a deal: if one remains silent and the other confesses, the one who confesses will receive a reduced sentence and the silent suspect will receive a harsher sentence. If both remain silent, both will receive a reduced sentence. If both confess, both will receive a harsher sentence.\n\nWhat will each suspect do? If they both choose to confess, they will each receive a sentence of 4 years. If they both remain silent, they will each receive a sentence of 1 year. If one confesses and the other stays silent, the one who confesses will receive no sentence and the other will receive 6 years. What is the optimal strategy for each suspect, and what outcome is likely to result?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for each suspect, we can create a payoff matrix to represent the possible outcomes:\n\n```\n          Suspect 1\n          Silent   |  Confess\n---------------------------\nSuspect 2 |         |\nSilent    | (1, 1)  | (6, 0)\n---------------------------\n          |         |\nConfess   | (0, 6)  | (4, 4)\n```\n\nIn this matrix, the first number in each pair represents the sentence length for Suspect 1, and the second number represents the sentence length for Suspect 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the optimal strategy for each suspect:\n\n1. If Suspect 1 believes that Suspect 2 will remain silent, their best strategy is to confess, as they will receive no sentence (0 years) instead of a 1-year sentence.\n2. If Suspect 1 believes that Suspect 2 will confess, their best strategy is also to confess, as they will receive a 4-year sentence instead of a 6-year sentence.\n\nThe same logic applies to Suspect 2. Regardless of what they believe the other suspect will do, their best strategy is to confess.\n\nThis leads to the likely outcome that both suspects will confess, resulting in each receiving a 4-year sentence. This is known as the Nash equilibrium in the Prisoner's Dilemma, where both players choose the strategy that is best for them individually, even though they would both be better off if they both remained silent."
