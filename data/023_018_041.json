    "message_2": "The given current input function i(t) is a sum of sinusoidal functions. Each sinusoidal function can be represented as A*sin(ωt + φ), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nIn the given function i(t) = 5sin(2πt) + 3sin(8πt) + 2sin(20πt), we can identify the amplitude, angular frequency, and phase angle for each component wave:\n\n1. Component wave 1: 5sin(2πt)\n   Amplitude (A1) = 5\n   Angular frequency (ω1) = 2π\n   Phase angle (φ1) = 0 (since there is no phase shift)\n\n2. Component wave 2: 3sin(8πt)\n   Amplitude (A2) = 3\n   Angular frequency (ω2) = 8π\n   Phase angle (φ2) = 0 (since there is no phase shift)\n\n3. Component wave 3: 2sin(20πt)\n   Amplitude (A3) = 2\n   Angular frequency (ω3) = 20π\n   Phase angle (φ3) = 0 (since there is no phase shift)\n\nSo, the amplitude, frequency, and phase angle for each component wave are:\n\nComponent wave 1: Amplitude = 5, Frequency = ω1/(2π) = 1 Hz, Phase angle = 0\nComponent wave 2: Amplitude = 3, Frequency = ω2/(2π) = 4 Hz, Phase angle = 0\nComponent wave 3: Amplitude = 2, Frequency = ω3/(2π) = 10 Hz, Phase angle = 0"
