    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe function is f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2.\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we find the derivative f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(x^3) - d/dx(4x^2) + d/dx(5x) - d/dx(2)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5\n\nNow, we evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 8(2) + 5\nf'(2) = 3(4) - 16 + 5\nf'(2) = 12 - 16 + 5\nf'(2) = -4 + 5\nf'(2) = 1\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 1."
