    "message_1": "A flagpole casts a shadow of 10 meters long. If the angle of elevation of the sun is 60 degrees, what is the height of the flagpole? (Round your answer to the nearest hundredth if necessary)",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation of the sun is 60 degrees, the shadow (adjacent side) is 10 meters long, and we want to find the height of the flagpole (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 10\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3, so:\n\n√3 = height / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 10 * √3\n\nheight ≈ 10 * 1.73\n\nheight ≈ 17.32 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 17.32 meters, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
