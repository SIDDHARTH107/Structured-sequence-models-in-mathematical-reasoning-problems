This orthogonal array is used to conduct experiments to determine the optimal combination of factor level settings that yield the maximum output of a given system. \n\nSuppose the following output data was generated from the experiments:\n\n|Trial|A|B|C|D|Output|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|1|1|1|1|9|\n|2|1|2|2|4|12|\n|3|2|1|4|2|8|\n|4|2|2|3|3|11|\n\nDetermine the optimal combination of factor level settings that yields the maximum output.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal combination of factor level settings, we will first calculate the average output for each factor level. Then, we will identify the factor level with the highest average output for each factor (A, B, C, and D).\n\nFactor A:\nLevel 1: (9 + 12) / 2 = 10.5\nLevel 2: (8 + 11) / 2 = 9.5\n\nFactor B:\nLevel 1: (9 + 8) / 2 = 8.5\nLevel 2: (12 + 11) / 2 = 11.5\n\nFactor C:\nLevel 1: (9) / 1 = 9\nLevel 2: (12) / 1 = 12\nLevel 3: (11) / 1 = 11\nLevel 4: (8) / 1 = 8\n\nFactor D:\nLevel 1: (9) / 1 = 9\nLevel 2: (8) / 1 = 8\nLevel 3: (11) / 1 = 11\nLevel 4: (12) / 1 = 12\n\nNow, we will choose the factor level with the highest average output for each factor:\n\nFactor A: Level 1 (10.5)\nFactor B: Level 2 (11.5)\nFactor C: Level 2 (12)\nFactor D: Level 4 (12)\n\nSo, the optimal combination of factor level settings that yields the maximum output is A1, B2, C2, and D4."
