Cyclic group: C_36\nThis group has one generator, and it is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 36 (Z_36).\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 × C_4\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has two generators, one for each cyclic group.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_3 × C_12\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 12. It has two generators, one for each cyclic group.\n\n4. Semidirect product of C_9 and C_4: C_9 ⋊ C_4\nThis group is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has a more complex structure than the direct product groups.\n\nTo summarize, the four non-isomorphic groups of order 36 are:\n\n1. C_36\n2. C_9 × C_4\n3. C_3 × C_12\n4. C_9 ⋊ C_4"
