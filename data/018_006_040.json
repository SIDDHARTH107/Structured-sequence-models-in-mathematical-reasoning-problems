    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set with 40 elements in it. Set A contains 20 elements, and its complement Ac contains 20 elements. Using set theory principles, prove that A ∪ Ac = U.",
    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ Ac = U, we need to show that every element in U is either in A or Ac, and that there are no elements outside of A and Ac.\n\nSince A and Ac are complements, by definition, every element in U is either in A or Ac. This means that if an element is not in A, it must be in Ac, and if an element is not in Ac, it must be in A. There are no elements that belong to both A and Ac, as they are disjoint sets.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements in each set. We are given that U has 40 elements, A has 20 elements, and Ac has 20 elements. Since A and Ac are disjoint sets, the total number of elements in A ∪ Ac is the sum of the number of elements in A and the number of elements in Ac. Therefore, the number of elements in A ∪ Ac is 20 + 20 = 40.\n\nSince A ∪ Ac contains 40 elements, which is the same as the number of elements in U, and every element in U is either in A or Ac, we can conclude that A ∪ Ac = U."
