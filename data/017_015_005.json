    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 24, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's find the number of 2-Sylow subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 3, then there are three 2-Sylow subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNext, let's find the number of 3-Sylow subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 8 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, then there are four 3-Sylow subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. If both n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q, both of which are normal. In this case, the group is the direct product of P and Q, which is abelian. So, this case does not give a non-abelian group.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then there is a unique normal 2-Sylow subgroup P and four 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, the group is the semi-direct product of P and one of the 3-Sylow subgroups Q. Since there are four 3-Sylow subgroups, there are four possible semi-direct products. However, one of these semi-direct products is the direct product, which is abelian. So, this case gives 3 non-abelian groups.\n\n3. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then there are three 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique normal 3-Sylow subgroup Q. In this case, the group is the semi-direct product of one of the 2-Sylow subgroups P and Q. Since there are three 2-Sylow subgroups, there are three possible semi-direct products. However, one of these semi-direct products is the direct product, which is abelian. So, this case gives 2 non-abelian groups.\n\n4. If both n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then there are three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, the group is the semi-direct product of one of the 2-Sylow subgroups P and one of the 3-Sylow subgroups Q. Since there are three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups, there are 12 possible semi-direct products. However, three of these semi-direct products are the direct product, which is abelian. So, this case gives 9 non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 2 + 9 = 14 non-abelian groups of order 24. These groups can be represented as semi-direct products of their respective Sylow subgroups."
