    "message_2": "To find the value of r at which the map undergoes its first period doubling bifurcation, we need to find when the fixed points of the map change stability. A fixed point is a point x* such that x* = r*sin^2(πx*). \n\nFirst, let's find the fixed points of the map. We have:\n\nx* = r*sin^2(πx*)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the map with respect to x:\n\ndx_{n+1}/dx_n = d(r*sin^2(πx_n))/dx_n = r * 2 * sin(πx_n) * cos(πx_n) * π\n\nAt the fixed point, we have:\n\ndx*/dx = r * 2 * sin(πx*) * cos(πx*) * π\n\nA period doubling bifurcation occurs when the magnitude of the derivative at the fixed point equals 1:\n\n|r * 2 * sin(πx*) * cos(πx*) * π| = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the value of r for which this equation holds. Since we are looking for the first period doubling bifurcation, we can assume that x* is close to 0. In this case, sin(πx*) is approximately πx* and cos(πx*) is approximately 1. Thus, we have:\n\n|r * 2 * (πx*) * 1 * π| = 1\n\n|r * 2 * π^2 * x*| = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the fixed point equation x* = r*sin^2(πx*) into this equation:\n\n|r * 2 * π^2 * r * sin^2(πx*)| = 1\n\n|r^2 * 2 * π^2 * sin^2(πx*)| = 1\n\nSince we are looking for the first bifurcation, we can assume that r is small. In this case, sin^2(πx*) is approximately (πx*)^2. Thus, we have:\n\n|r^2 * 2 * π^2 * (πx*)^2| = 1\n\n|r^2 * 2 * π^4 * x*^2| = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the fixed point equation x* = r*sin^2(πx*) into this equation again:\n\n|r^2 * 2 * π^4 * (r * sin^2(πx*))^2| = 1\n\n|r^4 * 2 * π^4 * sin^4(πx*)| = 1\n\nSince r is small, we can approximate sin^4(πx*) as (πx*)^4. Thus, we have:\n\n|r^4 * 2 * π^4 * (πx*)^4| = 1\n\n|r^4 * 2 * π^8 * x*^4| = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the fixed point equation x* = r*sin^2(πx*) into this equation one last time:\n\n|r^4 * 2 * π^8 * (r * sin^2(πx*))^4| = 1\n\n|r^8 * 2 * π^8 * sin^8(πx*)| = 1\n\nTaking the eighth root of both sides, we get:\n\n|r * sqrt(2) * π * sin^2(πx*)| = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for r:\n\nr = 1 / (sqrt(2) * π * sin^2(πx*))\n\nSince x* is close to 0, we can approximate sin^2(πx*) as (πx*)^2. Thus, we have:\n\nr ≈ 1 / (sqrt(2) * π * (πx*)^2)\n\nUsing the initial condition x_0 = 0.1, we can estimate the value of r at which the first period doubling bifurcation occurs:\n\nr ≈ 1 / (sqrt(2) * π * (π * 0.1)^2) ≈ 1 / (sqrt(2) * π * 0.01 * π^2) ≈ 1 / (0.01 * 2 * π^3) ≈ 1.892\n\nSo, the value of r at which the map undergoes its first period doubling bifurcation is approximately 1.892."
