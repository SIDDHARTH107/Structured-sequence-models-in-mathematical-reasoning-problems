    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = 2 * π * radius (r)\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 9 cm, we can plug it into the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * 9\n\nC ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 9\n\nC ≈ 56.54867 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle with a radius of 9 cm is approximately 56.55 cm."
