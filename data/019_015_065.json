He wants to group these integers into two sets, such that the first set has three integers and the second set has two integers. \n\n(i) How many possible ways are there for John to do this grouping?\n\n(ii) How many possible ways are there for John to do this grouping if he wants the two sets to have equal totals?",
    "message_2": "(i) To determine the number of possible ways to group the integers into two sets, we can use the combination formula. In this case, we want to choose 3 integers from the set of 5 integers, which can be represented as C(5,3). The combination formula is:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nSo, for this problem, we have:\n\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\nC(5,3) = 120 / (6 * 2)\nC(5,3) = 120 / 12\nC(5,3) = 10\n\nThere are 10 possible ways for John to group the integers into two sets with one set having three integers and the other set having two integers.\n\n(ii) To find the number of ways to group the integers such that the two sets have equal totals, we need to find the combinations that satisfy this condition. Let's list down the 10 possible groupings from part (i) and their totals:\n\n1. {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5} - Totals: 6 and 9\n2. {1, 2, 4} and {3, 5} - Totals: 7 and 8\n3. {1, 2, 5} and {3, 4} - Totals: 8 and 7\n4. {1, 3, 4} and {2, 5} - Totals: 8 and 7\n5. {1, 3, 5} and {2, 4} - Totals: 9 and 6\n6. {1, 4, 5} and {2, 3} - Totals: 10 and 5\n7. {2, 3, 4} and {1, 5} - Totals: 9 and 6\n8. {2, 3, 5} and {1, 4} - Totals: 10 and 5\n9. {2, 4, 5} and {1, 3} - Totals: 11 and 4\n10. {3, 4, 5} and {1, 2} - Totals: 12 and 3\n\nFrom the list above, there are no groupings that have equal totals. Therefore, there are 0 possible ways for John to group the integers into two sets with equal totals."
