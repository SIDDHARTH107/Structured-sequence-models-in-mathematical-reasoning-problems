    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we need to use the following recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-e; x, y) + T(G*e; x, y) if e is a bridge (cut-edge),\nT(G; x, y) = xT(G/e; x, y) if e is a loop,\nT(G; x, y) = yT(G*e; x, y) if e is a coloop (isthmus),\nT(G; x, y) = 1 if G is the empty graph.\n\nHere, G-e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, G*e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e and identifying its endpoints.\n\nHowever, to apply this formula, we need to know the specific structure of the graph G. Since we only have the information that G has 5 vertices and 7 edges, we cannot directly compute the Tutte polynomial.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the graph G, such as its adjacency matrix or a list of its edges, we can proceed with the computation of the Tutte polynomial."
