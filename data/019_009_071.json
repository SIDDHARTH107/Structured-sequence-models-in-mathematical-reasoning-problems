    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, we have the following truth values for P and Q:\n\nP is true\nQ is false\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statement: (P OR Q) AND (NOT P OR Q)\n\n1. (P OR Q): Since P is true, the whole statement (P OR Q) is true.\n\n2. (NOT P OR Q): Since P is true, NOT P is false. Now we have (false OR Q), and since Q is false, the whole statement (NOT P OR Q) is false.\n\nNow we have the final statement: (true) AND (false)\n\nIn intuitionistic logic, a statement is true if and only if it can be proven. In this case, (true) AND (false) cannot be proven, so the statement is false."
