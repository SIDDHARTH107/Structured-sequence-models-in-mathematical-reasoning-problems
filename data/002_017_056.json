    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by the number of triangles (6 in this case).\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so the side length of each triangle is also 5 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length:\n\nArea = (5² * √3) / 4\nArea = (25 * √3) / 4\n\nNow, we multiply this area by the number of triangles in the hexagon (6):\n\nTotal Area = 6 * (25 * √3) / 4\nTotal Area = (150 * √3) / 4\nTotal Area = 75√3 / 2\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon is (75√3) / 2 cm²."
