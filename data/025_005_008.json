    "message_2": "To find the singularities, we will compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to each variable and solve for when they are all equal to zero.\n\nLet f(x, y, z) = x^3 - y^2 - z^2. We will compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = -2y\n∂f/∂z = -2z\n\nNow, we need to solve for when all these partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 = 0\n-2y = 0\n-2z = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we get x = 0. From the second equation, we get y = 0. And from the third equation, we get z = 0.\n\nSo, the singularity of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 - y^2 - z^2 = 0 is at the point (0, 0, 0)."
