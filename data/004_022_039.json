    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to create a rectangular cardboard box with a volume of 280 cubic inches. The length of the box must be 3 inches longer than the width, and the height must be 2 inches less than the width. What dimensions should the manufacturer use to minimize the surface area of the box?",
    "message_2": "Let the width of the box be x, the length be x + 3, and the height be x - 2. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = length * width * height\n280 = (x + 3) * x * (x - 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that minimize the surface area. The surface area of the box is given by:\n\nA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\nA = 2(x + 3)x + 2(x + 3)(x - 2) + 2x(x - 2)\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = 0\n\nFirst, let's simplify the expression for A:\n\nA = 2x^2 + 6x + 2x^2 - 4x + 6x - 12 + 2x^2 - 4x\nA = 6x^2 - 2x - 12\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of A with respect to x:\n\ndA/dx = 12x - 2\n\nSetting dA/dx equal to 0 and solving for x:\n\n12x - 2 = 0\n12x = 2\nx = 1/6\n\nHowever, this value of x does not satisfy the volume equation. We need to find another way to minimize the surface area.\n\nWe can use the volume equation to express x in terms of one of the other dimensions. Let's solve the volume equation for x:\n\n280 = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x^2 - 6x\n280 = x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 280 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can use numerical methods (such as the Newton-Raphson method) to find an approximate value for x:\n\nx ≈ 4.92\n\nNow, we can find the other dimensions:\n\nLength = x + 3 ≈ 4.92 + 3 ≈ 7.92\nHeight = x - 2 ≈ 4.92 - 2 ≈ 2.92\n\nSo, the manufacturer should use dimensions of approximately 4.92 inches for the width, 7.92 inches for the length, and 2.92 inches for the height to minimize the surface area of the box."
