    "message_2": "To compute the value of $x_{100}$, we can iterate the given equation starting with the initial condition $x_0 = 0.5$. \n\n$x_{1} = 4(0.5)(1-0.5) = 1$\n$x_{2} = 4(1)(1-1) = 0$\n$x_{3} = 4(0)(1-0) = 0$\n\nNotice that once we reach $x_2 = 0$, the system becomes fixed at $x_n = 0$ for all $n > 2$. Therefore, $x_{100} = 0$.\n\nNow, let's check the sensitivity to small changes in the initial condition. Let $x'_0 = 0.5 + \\delta$, where $\\delta$ is a small perturbation.\n\n$x'_{1} = 4(0.5+\\delta)(1-(0.5+\\delta)) = 1 - 4\\delta + 4\\delta^2$\n$x'_{2} = 4(1-4\\delta+4\\delta^2)(4\\delta-3\\delta^2)$\n\nAt this point, it's clear that the system is sensitive to small changes in the initial condition, as the terms involving $\\delta$ and $\\delta^2$ will cause the sequence $x'_n$ to deviate from the original sequence $x_n$. This sensitivity to initial conditions is a characteristic of chaotic systems."
