    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Set the initial temperature T, the temperature reduction factor alpha, the number of iterations per temperature N, the solution neighborhood range delta, and the starting point x0.\n2. For each temperature level, perform N iterations.\n3. In each iteration, generate a random neighbor solution within the neighborhood range delta.\n4. Calculate the change in the objective function value (delta_f) between the current solution and the neighbor solution.\n5. If delta_f is negative (i.e., the neighbor solution is better), accept the neighbor solution as the new current solution.\n6. If delta_f is positive (i.e., the neighbor solution is worse), accept the neighbor solution with a probability of exp(-delta_f/T).\n7. Update the temperature by multiplying it with the temperature reduction factor alpha.\n8. Repeat steps 2-7 until the temperature is sufficiently low.\n\nNow, let's implement the algorithm using the given parameters:\n\nInitial temperature: T = 100\nTemperature reduction factor: alpha = 0.99\nNumber of iterations per temperature: N = 50\nSolution neighborhood range: delta = 0.5\nStarting point: x0 = 0\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return -x**2 + 5*x - 6\n\ndef simulated_annealing(T, alpha, N, delta, x0):\n    x = x0\n    while T > 0.001:\n        for _ in range(N):\n            x_neighbor = x + random.uniform(-delta, delta)\n            delta_f = f(x_neighbor) - f(x)\n            if delta_f < 0 or random.random() < math.exp(-delta_f/T):\n                x = x_neighbor\n        T *= alpha\n    return x\n\nx_star = simulated_annealing(100, 0.99, 50, 0.5, 0)\nmin_value = f(x_star)\n```\n\nThe optimal value of x* and the minimum value of the function f(x) at x* will depend on the random nature of the simulated annealing algorithm. You can run the algorithm multiple times to get different results. However, the algorithm should converge to the true minimum of the function, which can be found analytically by taking the derivative of f(x) and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = -2x + 5\n0 = -2x + 5\nx = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nThe true minimum value of the function is f(2.5) = -2.5^2 + 5*2.5 - 6 = -6.25. The simulated annealing algorithm should give you a value close to x* = 2.5 and f(x*) = -6.25."
