    "message_1": "Let's say you have a rational curve in the complex projective space P³, with equation f(x,y,z) = 0, where \n\nf(x,y,z) = x³ + y³ + z³ - 3xyz.\n\nWhat is the degree of this curve?",
    "message_2": "The degree of a curve in projective space is determined by the highest total degree of the terms in its defining equation. In this case, the equation is:\n\nf(x,y,z) = x³ + y³ + z³ - 3xyz\n\nEach of the first three terms (x³, y³, and z³) has a total degree of 3. The last term, -3xyz, also has a total degree of 3 (1+1+1). Therefore, the degree of this rational curve in the complex projective space P³ is 3."
