    "message_2": "To find the complex potential function, phi(z), we first need to solve the given wave equation:\n\nd^2(phi)/dz^2 + k^2*phi = 0\n\nWe are given that phi(z) is proportional to e^(ikz) for large values of |z|. Let's assume a solution of the form:\n\nphi(z) = A*e^(ikz)\n\nwhere A is the constant of proportionality that we need to find.\n\nNow, let's find the first and second derivatives of phi(z) with respect to z:\n\nd(phi)/dz = A*ik*e^(ikz)\nd^2(phi)/dz^2 = A*(ik)^2*e^(ikz) = -A*k^2*e^(ikz)\n\nNow, let's substitute these derivatives back into the wave equation:\n\n-A*k^2*e^(ikz) + k^2*(A*e^(ikz)) = 0\n\nWe can factor out A*e^(ikz):\n\nA*e^(ikz)*(-k^2 + k^2) = 0\n\nSince e^(ikz) is never zero, we can divide both sides by it:\n\nA*(-k^2 + k^2) = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nA*0 = 0\n\nSince A can be any constant, the constant of proportionality A can be any value. Therefore, the complex potential function phi(z) is given by:\n\nphi(z) = A*e^(ikz)\n\nwhere A is any constant."
