Let's write the message \"MATHEMATICS\" in this pattern:\n\nM   -   -   -   A   -   -   -   T\n-   H   -   E   -   M   -   I   -\n-   -   T   -   -   -   C   -   -\n-   -   -   S   -   -   -   -   -\n\nNow, let's read the message row by row to get the ciphertext:\n\nM - A - T - H - E - M - I - T - C - S\n\nThe resulting ciphertext is: \"MATHEMITCS\"."
