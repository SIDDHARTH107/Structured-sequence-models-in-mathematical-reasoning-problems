    "message_2": "To solve the equation log10(x-1) + log10(x+3) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nStep 1: Combine the logarithms using the product rule.\nThe product rule states that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog10((x-1)(x+3)) = 2\n\nStep 2: Remove the logarithm by raising both sides to the base 10.\nTo remove the log10, we can raise both sides of the equation to the base 10:\n\n10^(log10((x-1)(x+3))) = 10^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(x-1)(x+3) = 100\n\nStep 3: Expand the equation and solve for x.\nNow, we can expand the equation and solve for x:\n\nx^2 + 3x - x - 3 = 100\nx^2 + 2x - 3 = 100\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 103 = 0\n\nStep 4: Solve the quadratic equation.\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. Unfortunately, this equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -103. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(-103))) / 2(1)\nx = (-2 ± √(412)) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (-2 + √412) / 2 ≈ 9.372\nx = (-2 - √412) / 2 ≈ -11.372\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with logarithms, we must consider the domain of the original equation. The arguments of the logarithms (x-1) and (x+3) must be greater than 0. Therefore, x > 1 and x > -3. The solution x ≈ -11.372 does not satisfy these conditions, so we discard it.\n\nThus, the only valid solution for x is:\n\nx ≈ 9.372"
