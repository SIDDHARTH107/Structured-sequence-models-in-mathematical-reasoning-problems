    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 85436 is divided by 3, we can use the divisibility rule for 3. The rule states that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3.\n\nLet's find the sum of the digits of 85436:\n\n8 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 26\n\nSince 26 is not divisible by 3, 85436 is not divisible by 3. Now, let's find the remainder:\n\n85436 รท 3 = 28478 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, the remainder when 85436 is divided by 3 is 2."
