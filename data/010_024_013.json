    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a triangle is related to its angles by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle with angles α, β, and γ is:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nGiven the angles 40°, 60°, and 80°, we can convert them to radians:\n\nα = 40° * (π/180) = 2π/9\nβ = 60° * (π/180) = π/3\nγ = 80° * (π/180) = 4π/9\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the area:\n\nArea = π - (2π/9 + π/3 + 4π/9)\nArea = π - (π) = 0\n\nHowever, the given area is 6, which contradicts the calculated area of 0. This means that there is no hyperbolic triangle with angles 40°, 60°, and 80° and an area of 6."
