    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node E, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We start by initializing the flow along each edge to 0. Then, we repeatedly find an augmenting path from A to E and update the flow along the edges of that path until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path: A → B → D → E. The minimum capacity along this path is 5 (edge B → D). We update the flow along these edges:\n\n   - A → B: 5 (5/10)\n   - B → D: 5 (5/5)\n   - D → E: 5 (5/15)\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: A → B → C → E. The minimum capacity along this path is 5 (edge A → B). We update the flow along these edges:\n\n   - A → B: 10 (10/10)\n   - B → C: 5 (5/10)\n   - C → E: 5 (5/10)\n\n3. Finally, we find one more augmenting path: A → C → D → E. The minimum capacity along this path is 10 (edge A → C). We update the flow along these edges:\n\n   - A → C: 10 (10/10)\n   - C → D: 5 (5/5)\n   - D → E: 10 (10/15)\n\nNow, we cannot find any more augmenting paths from A to E. The flow along each edge is as follows:\n\n- A → B: 10/10\n- A → C: 10/10\n- B → C: 0/5\n- B → D: 5/5\n- C → D: 5/5\n- C → E: 5/10\n- D → E: 10/15\n\nThe maximum flow from node A to node E is the sum of the flows out of node A, which is 10 + 10 = 20."
