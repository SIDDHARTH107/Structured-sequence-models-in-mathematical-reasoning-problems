    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial completely, we look for two binomials that multiply to give the original polynomial. In this case, we are looking for two numbers that multiply to 16 and add up to 8.\n\nThe two numbers that fit this criteria are 4 and 4. Therefore, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n(x + 4)(x + 4) or (x + 4)^2"
