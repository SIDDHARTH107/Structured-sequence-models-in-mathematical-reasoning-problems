    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one triangle, then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe side length of each equilateral triangle is 8 cm (same as the side length of the hexagon). To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length of 8 cm:\n\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (8² * √3) / 4 = (64 * √3) / 4 = 16√3 square centimeters\n\nNow, multiply the area of one equilateral triangle by 6 to find the area of the hexagon:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (16√3) = 96√3 square centimeters"
