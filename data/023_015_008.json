    "message_1": "A guitar string is plucked so as to produce a transverse displacement described by the function $y(x,0) = 2\\sin(2\\pi x/L)$, where $L$ is the length of the string. Find the velocity and acceleration of the string at any time $t$ using the Fourier transform. Assume the tension and mass per unit length of the string are constant. The wave speed is given by $v=\\sqrt{T/\\mu}$, where $T$ is the tension and $\\mu$ is the mass per unit length.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the string at any time $t$, we first need to find the general solution for the wave equation. The wave equation for a vibrating string is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} = v^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}$$\n\nwhere $y(x,t)$ is the displacement of the string at position $x$ and time $t$, and $v$ is the wave speed.\n\nWe can solve this equation using the method of separation of variables. Let $y(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = v^2 X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nDividing both sides by $v^2 X(x)T(t)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{v^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$$\n\nwhere $k^2$ is the separation constant. Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0$$\n$$T''(t) + v^2 k^2 T(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$$\n\nSince the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions $X(0) = X(L) = 0$. This implies that $B = 0$ and $k = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nThe general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\sin(vkt) + D\\cos(vkt)$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the wave equation as:\n\n$$y(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\left[C_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi vt}{L}\\right) + D_n\\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi vt}{L}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, $C_n$, and $D_n$, we use the initial conditions. At $t = 0$, we have:\n\n$$y(x,0) = 2\\sin(2\\pi x/L) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)D_n$$\n\nComparing the given function with the general solution, we can see that $A_2 = 2$ and $D_2 = 1$, while $A_n = D_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 2$. Therefore, the solution for the displacement of the string is:\n\n$$y(x,t) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi vt}{L}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity and acceleration of the string. The velocity is given by the first derivative of the displacement with respect to time:\n\n$$v(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{4\\pi v}{L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi vt}{L}\\right)$$\n\nThe acceleration is given by the second derivative of the displacement with respect to time:\n\n$$a(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} = -\\frac{4\\pi^2 v^2}{L^2}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi vt}{L}\\right)$$\n\nThese are the expressions for the velocity and acceleration of the string at any time $t$."
