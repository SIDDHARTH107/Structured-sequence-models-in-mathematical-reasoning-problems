    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0, we can try to find its roots using various methods such as factoring, synthetic division, or the rational root theorem. In this case, we will use the rational root theorem.\n\nThe rational root theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. For our polynomial, the constant term is -4, and the leading coefficient is 2. \n\nFactors of -4: ±1, ±2, ±4\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±4, ±1/2\n\nNow, we will test these possible rational roots using synthetic division or direct substitution.\n\n1. Testing x = 1:\n2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 3(1) - 4 = 2 - 5 + 3 - 4 = -4 ≠ 0\n\n2. Testing x = -1:\n2(-1)^3 - 5(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 4 = -2 - 5 - 3 - 4 = -14 ≠ 0\n\n3. Testing x = 2:\n2(2)^3 - 5(2)^2 + 3(2) - 4 = 16 - 20 + 6 - 4 = -2 ≠ 0\n\n4. Testing x = -2:\n2(-2)^3 - 5(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 4 = -16 - 20 - 6 - 4 = -46 ≠ 0\n\n5. Testing x = 4:\n2(4)^3 - 5(4)^2 + 3(4) - 4 = 128 - 80 + 12 - 4 = 56 ≠ 0\n\n6. Testing x = -4:\n2(-4)^3 - 5(-4)^2 + 3(-4) - 4 = -128 - 80 - 12 - 4 = -224 ≠ 0\n\n7. Testing x = 1/2:\n2(1/2)^3 - 5(1/2)^2 + 3(1/2) - 4 = 1/4 - 5/4 + 3/2 - 4 = 0\n\nSo, x = 1/2 is a root of the polynomial.\n\nNow, we will perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n      _________________________\n1/2 |  2    -5      3      -4\n          1     -2       1\n      _________________________\n          2    -4      1      -3\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is 2x^2 - 4x + 1. To find the remaining roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(2)(1))) / (2(2))\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 8)) / 4\nx = (4 ± √8) / 4\nx = (4 ± 2√2) / 4\nx = 1 ± (1/2)√2\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0 are x = 1/2, x = 1 + (1/2)√2, and x = 1 - (1/2)√2."
