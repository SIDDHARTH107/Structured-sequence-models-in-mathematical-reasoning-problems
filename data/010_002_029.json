    "message_2": "To prove that the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(x) in Y, we need to show that for every open neighborhood V of f(x) in Y, there exists a positive integer N such that for all n ≥ N, f(x_n) ∈ V.\n\nSince f is continuous, by the definition of continuity in topology, for every open neighborhood V of f(x) in Y, f^(-1)(V) is an open set in X containing x. Since {x_n} converges to x in X, there exists a positive integer N such that for all n ≥ N, x_n ∈ f^(-1)(V). \n\nNow, since x_n ∈ f^(-1)(V), this means that f(x_n) ∈ V for all n ≥ N. Thus, the sequence {f(x_n)} converges to f(x) in Y.\n\nThis completes the proof."
