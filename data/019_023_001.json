    "message_1": "A math teacher observed that the first three terms of a sequence are 3, 7, and 11, with each term increasing by 4 from the previous term. Using inductive reasoning, determine the next two terms of the sequence and write an explicit formula to find the nth term of this sequence.",
    "message_2": "Since each term increases by 4 from the previous term, we can find the next two terms by adding 4 to the last known term.\n\nThe fourth term is 11 + 4 = 15.\nThe fifth term is 15 + 4 = 19.\n\nNow, let's write an explicit formula for the nth term of this sequence. We can see that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nwhere an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the position of the term in the sequence, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, a1 = 3 and d = 4. So, the explicit formula for the nth term of this sequence is:\n\nan = 3 + (n - 1) * 4"
