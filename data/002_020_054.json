    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the sum of the two radii. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nGiven:\nRadius (r) = 7 cm\nCentral angle = 25 degrees\n\nLet's find the arc length:\n\nArc length = (25/360) × 2π(7)\nArc length = (25/360) × 44\nArc length = 25 × 0.122222 × 44\nArc length ≈ 3.0555 cm\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 × radius\nPerimeter = 3.0555 + 2 × 7\nPerimeter = 3.0555 + 14\nPerimeter ≈ 17.0555 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is approximately 17.0555 cm."
