    "message_2": "To find the impulse response of the network, we need to find the inverse Fourier Transform of the transfer function H(jw). The impulse response is given by h(t) = F^(-1){H(jw)}, where F^(-1) denotes the inverse Fourier Transform.\n\nH(jw) = (4w^2 - 9) / (w^4 + 4w^2 + 25)\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial fraction decomposition of H(jw). To do this, we factor the denominator:\n\nw^4 + 4w^2 + 25 = (w^2 + 2w + 5)(w^2 - 2w + 5)\n\nNow we can rewrite H(jw) as:\n\nH(jw) = A / (w^2 + 2w + 5) + B / (w^2 - 2w + 5)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can multiply both sides by the denominator and solve for A and B:\n\n4w^2 - 9 = A(w^2 - 2w + 5) + B(w^2 + 2w + 5)\n\nBy comparing coefficients, we can find the values of A and B:\n\nA + B = 4\n-2A + 2B = 0\n5A + 5B = -9\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get A = -3 and B = 7.\n\nNow we have:\n\nH(jw) = -3 / (w^2 + 2w + 5) + 7 / (w^2 - 2w + 5)\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier Transform, we can use the following property:\n\nF^(-1){1 / (w^2 + 2aw + a^2 + b^2)} = (1/b) * e^(-at) * sin(bt) * u(t)\n\nApplying this property to both terms:\n\nh(t) = F^(-1){H(jw)} = -3 * F^(-1){1 / (w^2 + 2w + 5)} + 7 * F^(-1){1 / (w^2 - 2w + 5)}\n\nh(t) = -3 * (1/2) * e^(-t) * sin(2t) * u(t) + 7 * (1/2) * e^(t) * sin(2t) * u(t)\n\nh(t) = (-3/2) * e^(-t) * sin(2t) * u(t) + (7/2) * e^(t) * sin(2t) * u(t)\n\nThis is the impulse response of the network."
