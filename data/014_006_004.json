    "message_1": "Suppose you have a one-time pad key with 50 bits and a plaintext message to encrypt with 30 bits. Using the one-time pad encryption technique, what is the minimum length of ciphertext that can be generated?",
    "message_2": "A one-time pad encryption technique requires the key to be at least as long as the plaintext message. In this case, the key is 50 bits long, and the plaintext message is 30 bits long. Since the key is longer than the plaintext message, you can use the first 30 bits of the key to encrypt the 30-bit plaintext message.\n\nThe ciphertext will have the same length as the plaintext message, which is 30 bits. Therefore, the minimum length of ciphertext that can be generated is 30 bits."
