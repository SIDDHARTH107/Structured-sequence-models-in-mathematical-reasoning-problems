    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem related to Diffie-Hellman key exchange:\n\n\"Suppose Alice and Bob want to communicate securely using Diffie-Hellman key exchange. They agree to use a modulus p = 23 and base g = 5. Alice chooses a secret number a = 10 and calculates A = g^a mod p. Bob chooses a secret number b = 7 and calculates B = g^b mod p. What is the value of the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to communicate securely?\"",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Alice calculates A = g^a mod p:\n   A = 5^10 mod 23\n   A = 9765625 mod 23\n   A = 18\n\n2. Bob calculates B = g^b mod p:\n   B = 5^7 mod 23\n   B = 78125 mod 23\n   B = 10\n\n3. Alice calculates the shared secret key using Bob's B value:\n   Shared Secret Key (Alice) = B^a mod p\n   Shared Secret Key (Alice) = 10^10 mod 23\n   Shared Secret Key (Alice) = 10000000000 mod 23\n   Shared Secret Key (Alice) = 9\n\n4. Bob calculates the shared secret key using Alice's A value:\n   Shared Secret Key (Bob) = A^b mod p\n   Shared Secret Key (Bob) = 18^7 mod 23\n   Shared Secret Key (Bob) = 612220032 mod 23\n   Shared Secret Key (Bob) = 9\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key, which is 9. They can now use this key to communicate securely."
