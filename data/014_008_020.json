    "message_2": "The total number of keys available for a block cipher with a maximum key size of 128 bits can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal number of keys = 2^(key size)\n\nIn this case, the key size is 128 bits. So the total number of keys available is:\n\nTotal number of keys = 2^128 â‰ˆ 3.4 x 10^38\n\nThere are approximately 3.4 x 10^38 different keys available for this block cipher."
