    "message_2": "To find all the possible non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. \n\nLet G be a group of order 36. By Sylow's theorems, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since both P and Q are normal in G, we have G = P x Q. Thus, G is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_9, which is an abelian group.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, we have a semidirect product G = P ⋊ Q, where Q is a Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possible actions of Q on P: trivial and non-trivial. The trivial action gives us the direct product Z_4 x Z_9, which we already considered in case 1. The non-trivial action gives us a non-abelian group, which we will denote as G_1.\n\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1: In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since Q is normal in G, we have a semidirect product G = P ⋊ Q, where P is a Sylow 2-subgroup. There is only one possible action of Q on P, which gives us the direct product Z_4 x Z_9, which we already considered in case 1.\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4: In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. There is no normal Sylow subgroup in this case, so we cannot use the semidirect product. However, we can consider the group G = PSL(2, Z_9), which is a non-abelian group of order 36. We will denote this group as G_2.\n\nIn summary, we have found four non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. Z_4 x Z_9 (abelian)\n2. G_1 (non-abelian)\n3. G_2 (non-abelian)\n\nNote that there might be other non-isomorphic groups of order 36, but these are the main ones that can be derived using the Sylow theorems."
