    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 4)/(cos z), we need to determine the points where the function is not defined. These points occur when the denominator is equal to zero, i.e., when cos(z) = 0.\n\nThe function cos(z) has zeros at z = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer. So, the singularities of f(z) are at z = (2n + 1)π/2.\n\nNow, we need to classify these singularities as removable, pole, or essential singularities.\n\n1. Removable singularities: A singularity is removable if the function can be redefined at the singular point to make it continuous. In this case, there is no such redefinition possible, so there are no removable singularities.\n\n2. Pole singularities: A singularity is a pole if the function approaches infinity as z approaches the singular point. Let's examine the behavior of f(z) near the singular points:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 4)/(cos z)\n\nAs z approaches (2n + 1)π/2, cos(z) approaches 0. However, the numerator (z^2 - 4) does not approach 0 or infinity at these points. Therefore, the function f(z) approaches infinity as z approaches (2n + 1)π/2, and these singularities are poles.\n\n3. Essential singularities: A singularity is essential if it is neither removable nor a pole. In this case, we have already determined that the singularities are poles, so there are no essential singularities.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) = (z^2 - 4)/(cos z) has singularities at z = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer, and all of these singularities are poles."
