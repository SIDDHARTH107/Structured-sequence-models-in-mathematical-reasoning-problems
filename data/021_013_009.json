    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit generated by selling one unit of product A is $200 and for product B it is $300. The company has a production capacity of 500 units per week. It takes 4 minutes to produce one unit of A and 5 minutes to produce one unit of B. The company wants to maximize their weekly profits using the simulated annealing method. Find the optimal number of units of A and B to produce each week.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and the objective function. The constraints are the production capacity and the time it takes to produce each unit. The objective function is the profit generated by selling the products.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. x + y ≤ 500 (production capacity constraint)\n2. 4x + 5y ≤ 500 * 60 (time constraint, as there are 500 * 60 minutes available per week)\n\nObjective function:\nProfit = 200x + 300y\n\nWe can use the simulated annealing method to find the optimal solution. However, this method is more suitable for complex optimization problems with a large number of variables and constraints. In this case, we can solve the problem using linear programming techniques, which are more efficient for this type of problem.\n\nUsing linear programming, we can find the optimal solution by graphing the constraints and finding the feasible region. Then, we can identify the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nAfter solving the linear programming problem, we find that the optimal solution is to produce 100 units of product A and 400 units of product B each week. This will result in a maximum weekly profit of $140,000."
