    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for the mass-spring system, we can use the following formula:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the mass at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nWe are given the amplitude A = 12 cm = 0.12 m and the frequency f = 3 Hz. To find the angular frequency ω, we can use the formula:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nPlugging in the given frequency, we get:\n\nω = 2π(3 Hz) = 6π rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the phase angle φ. To do this, we can use the initial conditions of the system. Since we are not given any specific initial conditions, we can assume that the mass is at its maximum displacement (amplitude) when t = 0. This means that:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ)\n\nPlugging in the given amplitude and x(0) = 0.12 m, we get:\n\n0.12 m = 0.12 * cos(φ)\n\nThis implies that cos(φ) = 1, and therefore, φ = 0.\n\nNow we have all the necessary information to write the equation of motion for the system:\n\nx(t) = 0.12 * cos(6πt)"
