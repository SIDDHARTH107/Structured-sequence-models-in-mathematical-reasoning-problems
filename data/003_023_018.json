    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we first need to find the magnitudes of the vectors and the angle between them.\n\nVector A = 2i + 5j\nMagnitude of A = |A| = √(2^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nVector B = 4i - 3j\nMagnitude of B = |B| = √(4^2 + (-3)^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula for this:\n\nA • B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n(2i + 5j) • (4i - 3j) = (√29) * (5) * cos(θ)\n\nCalculating the dot product:\n(2 * 4) + (5 * -3) = 8 - 15 = -7\n\nSo, -7 = (√29) * (5) * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for the angle θ:\ncos(θ) = -7 / (5√29)\nθ = arccos(-7 / (5√29))\n\nNow that we have the angle between the vectors, we can find the cross product using the formula:\n\n|A x B| = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\n\nWe already have the magnitudes of A and B, so we just need to find sin(θ). Since we have cos(θ), we can use the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - cos^2(θ)\nsin(θ) = √(1 - cos^2(θ))\n\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (-7 / (5√29))^2)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n|A x B| = (√29) * (5) * sin(θ)\n\nFinally, note that the cross product of two vectors in the xy-plane will always be a vector in the z-direction. Therefore, the cross product of A and B is:\n\nA x B = k * |A x B|\nA x B = k * (√29) * (5) * sin(θ)\n\nTo find the exact value of the cross product, you can plug in the value of sin(θ) and compute the expression."
