    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing triangles from an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the remaining triangles are divided into four smaller equilateral triangles, and the central triangle is removed. The number of triangles added at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles added at level n = 3^n\n\nTo find the total number of triangles needed to construct the level 5 Sierpinski sieve, we need to sum the number of triangles added at each level from 1 to 5:\n\nLevel 1: 3^1 = 3 triangles\nLevel 2: 3^2 = 9 triangles\nLevel 3: 3^3 = 27 triangles\nLevel 4: 3^4 = 81 triangles\nLevel 5: 3^5 = 243 triangles\n\nTotal number of triangles needed for level 5 Sierpinski sieve = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 363 triangles."
