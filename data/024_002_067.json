    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, which pass through the point (3,4,0), we can use the fact that geodesics on a sphere are great circles. A great circle is the intersection of a sphere with a plane that passes through the center of the sphere.\n\nLet the sphere be defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25, and let the point P be (3,4,0). We want to find the equation of the plane that passes through the center of the sphere (0,0,0) and the point P.\n\nThe normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the vector from the center of the sphere to the point P, which is <3,4,0>. Thus, the equation of the plane can be written as:\n\n3x + 4y + 0z = D\n\nTo find the value of D, we can plug in the coordinates of the point P:\n\n3(3) + 4(4) + 0(0) = D\n9 + 16 = D\nD = 25\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is:\n\n3x + 4y = 25\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection of this plane with the sphere. We can substitute the equation of the plane into the equation of the sphere:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\nx^2 + y^2 + (25 - 3x - 4y)^2 = 25\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + 9x^2 - 24x + 16y^2 - 100y + 625 = 25\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n10x^2 + 17y^2 - 24x - 100y + 600 = 0\n\nThis is the equation of the geodesic on the surface of the sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, which passes through the point (3,4,0)."
