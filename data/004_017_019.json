    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we need to compute the integral of the arc length formula. The arc length formula for parametric equations is given by:\n\nL = ∫√((dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)²) dt\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of x and y with respect to t:\n\ndx/dt = -sin(t)\ndy/dt = cos(t)\n\nNow, we can square each derivative and add them together:\n\n(-sin(t))² + (cos(t))² = sin²(t) + cos²(t)\n\nSince sin²(t) + cos²(t) = 1, we have:\n\nL = ∫√(1) dt\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to t over the interval [0, 2π]:\n\nL = ∫[0, 2π] 1 dt = [t] (from 0 to 2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π\n\nSo, the exact length of the curve is 2π."
