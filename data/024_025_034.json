    "message_2": "To compute the second Chern class c2(X), we need more information about the complex manifold X. The Chern classes are topological invariants of complex vector bundles, and in the case of complex manifolds, they are associated with the tangent bundle of the manifold. \n\nThe first Chern class c1(X) is related to the curvature of the manifold, and in this case, it is given as 3h, where h is the hyperplane class. However, to compute the second Chern class c2(X), we need more information about the manifold, such as its dimension, the structure of its tangent bundle, or any additional topological information.\n\nIn general, the second Chern class c2(X) can be expressed as a polynomial in the Chern roots of the tangent bundle, and it is related to the Euler characteristic of the manifold. Without further information about X, it is not possible to provide an explicit expression for c2(X)."
