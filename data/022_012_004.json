    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator of the function is equal to zero. In this case, the numerator is $(z-1)^2$. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$(z-1)^2 = 0$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$z-1 = 0$\n\nAdding 1 to both sides, we get:\n\n$z = 1$\n\nSo, the function has a zero at $z = 1$. Since the zero is squared in the numerator, its order is 2.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator of the function is equal to zero. The denominator is $(z+2)(z-3)^3$. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$(z+2)(z-3)^3 = 0$\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either $(z+2) = 0$ or $(z-3)^3 = 0$. \n\nFor $(z+2) = 0$, we get:\n\n$z = -2$\n\nSo, the function has a pole at $z = -2$. Since the pole is not raised to any power in the denominator, its order is 1.\n\nFor $(z-3)^3 = 0$, we get:\n\n$z-3 = 0$\n\nAdding 3 to both sides, we get:\n\n$z = 3$\n\nSo, the function has a pole at $z = 3$. Since the pole is cubed in the denominator, its order is 3.\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z) = \\frac{(z-1)^2}{(z+2)(z-3)^3}$ has:\n\n- A zero at $z = 1$ with order 2.\n- A pole at $z = -2$ with order 1.\n- A pole at $z = 3$ with order 3."
