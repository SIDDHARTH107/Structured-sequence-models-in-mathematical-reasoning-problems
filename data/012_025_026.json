    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph.\n\nWe can start at vertex 1 and try to visit each vertex exactly once:\n\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6\n\nNow, we need to check if there is an edge connecting vertex 6 back to vertex 1. Unfortunately, there is no such edge in the given graph.\n\nTherefore, the graph does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle."
