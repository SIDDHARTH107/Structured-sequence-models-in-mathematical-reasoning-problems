    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 2, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2, the derivative is 2 * 3x^(2-1) = 6x.\nFor the second term, 4x, the derivative is 1 * 4x^(1-1) = 4.\nThe third term, -2, is a constant, so its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of each term together:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 4\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 2 is f'(x) = 6x + 4."
