    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3y = 0\n3y^2 - 3x = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\nx^2 - y = 0\ny^2 - x = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. From the first equation, we have y = x^2. Substitute this into the second equation:\n\n(x^2)^2 - x = 0\nx^4 - x = 0\nx(x^3 - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: x = 0 and x = 1. Let's find the corresponding y values:\n\nFor x = 0:\ny = (0)^2 = 0\n\nFor x = 1:\ny = (1)^2 = 1\n\nSo, we have two singular points: (0, 0) and (1, 1).\n\nNow, let's determine the type of these singular points. We need to compute the second-order partial derivatives and evaluate the Hessian matrix at these points:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 6x\n∂²f/∂y² = 6y\n∂²f/∂x∂y = -3\n\nThe Hessian matrix H is given by:\n\nH = | 6x  -3 |\n    | -3  6y |\n\nNow, let's evaluate the Hessian matrix at the singular points:\n\nFor (0, 0):\nH = |  0  -3 |\n    | -3   0 |\n\nThe determinant of this Hessian matrix is det(H) = 0 * 0 - (-3) * (-3) = -9, which is negative. Therefore, the singular point (0, 0) is a saddle point (not a node, cusp, or double point).\n\nFor (1, 1):\nH = |  6  -3 |\n    | -3   6 |\n\nThe determinant of this Hessian matrix is det(H) = 6 * 6 - (-3) * (-3) = 36 - 9 = 27, which is positive. Since both eigenvalues of this Hessian matrix are positive, the singular point (1, 1) is a local minimum (not a node, cusp, or double point).\n\nIn conclusion, the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 - 3xy = 0 has two singular points: (0, 0) and (1, 1). Neither of these points are nodes, cusps, or double points. The point (0, 0) is a saddle point, and the point (1, 1) is a local minimum."
