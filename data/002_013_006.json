    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 10 cm, width of 6 cm, and a height of 8 cm. What is the volume of this pyramid rounded to the nearest cubic centimeter?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nIn this case, the length is 10 cm, the width is 6 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 10 * 6 * 8\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 480\n\nVolume = 160 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the pyramid is approximately 160 cubic centimeters."
