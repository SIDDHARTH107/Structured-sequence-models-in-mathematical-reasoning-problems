    "message_2": "Since the sphere is tangent to all six faces of the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so the side length of the cube is 2 * 4 = 8 units.\n\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula V = side^3. In this case, the side length is 8, so the volume of the cube is 8^3 = 512 cubic units."
