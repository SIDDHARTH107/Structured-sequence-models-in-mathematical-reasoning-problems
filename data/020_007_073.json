Each unit of each product requires a different amount of production time:\n\nProduct A: 3 min/unit\nProduct B: 2.5 min/unit\nProduct C: 4 min/unit\nProduct D: 3.5 min/unit\nProduct E: 2 min/unit\n\nHow many units of each product should the company produce each day to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to calculate the profit per minute for each product and prioritize producing the products with the highest profit per minute.\n\nProfit per minute for each product:\nProduct A: $20 / 3 min = $6.67/min\nProduct B: $25 / 2.5 min = $10/min\nProduct C: $18 / 4 min = $4.5/min\nProduct D: $22 / 3.5 min = $6.29/min\nProduct E: $28 / 2 min = $14/min\n\nThe products should be produced in the following order of priority: E, B, A, D, C.\n\nThe total production time available per day is 300 units * 60 minutes/unit = 18,000 minutes.\n\nWe will now allocate the production time to each product based on the priority order:\n\n1. Product E: Since it has the highest profit per minute, we should produce as many units as possible. However, we need to make sure we don't exceed the 300 units limit.\n\n18,000 minutes / 2 min/unit = 9,000 units (but we can only produce 300 units)\n\nSo, we produce 300 units of Product E, which takes 300 * 2 min/unit = 600 minutes.\n\n2. Product B: With the remaining production time, we will produce Product B.\n\nRemaining time: 18,000 - 600 = 17,400 minutes\n\n17,400 minutes / 2.5 min/unit = 6,960 units (but we can only produce 300 units)\n\nSo, we produce 300 units of Product B, which takes 300 * 2.5 min/unit = 750 minutes.\n\n3. Product A, D, and C: Since we have already reached the production limit of 300 units per day, we cannot produce any more units of these products.\n\nIn conclusion, to maximize profit, the company should produce 300 units of Product E and 300 units of Product B each day."
