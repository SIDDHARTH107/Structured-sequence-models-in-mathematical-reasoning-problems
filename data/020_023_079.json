If the correlation coefficient between the two stocks is 0.5, what is the optimal allocation between the two stocks that maximizes the investor's expected return while keeping the portfolio risk at a minimum?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation between the two stocks that maximizes the investor's expected return while keeping the portfolio risk at a minimum, we will use the concept of portfolio variance and the formula for the minimum variance portfolio.\n\nLet x be the proportion of the investment in Stock A and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in Stock B.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\nRp = x * Expected Return of Stock A + (1-x) * Expected Return of Stock B\nRp = x * 0.12 + (1-x) * 0.08\n\nThe portfolio variance (σ²p) can be calculated as:\nσ²p = x² * σ²A + (1-x)² * σ²B + 2 * x * (1-x) * ρAB * σA * σB\nwhere σ²A and σ²B are the variances of Stock A and Stock B, respectively, and ρAB is the correlation coefficient between the two stocks.\n\nGiven the standard deviations and correlation coefficient, we can calculate the portfolio variance as:\nσ²p = x² * (0.2)² + (1-x)² * (0.1)² + 2 * x * (1-x) * 0.5 * 0.2 * 0.1\n\nTo find the optimal allocation that minimizes the portfolio variance, we will take the derivative of the portfolio variance with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\nd(σ²p) / dx = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx ≈ 0.3333\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation between the two stocks is approximately 33.33% in Stock A and 66.67% in Stock B. This allocation will maximize the investor's expected return while keeping the portfolio risk at a minimum.\n\nWith this allocation, the expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\nRp = 0.3333 * 0.12 + 0.6667 * 0.08 ≈ 0.0933 or 9.33%\n\nSo, the investor should invest $33,330 (33.33% of $100,000) in Stock A and $66,670 (66.67% of $100,000) in Stock B to achieve an expected return of 9.33% while minimizing the portfolio risk."
