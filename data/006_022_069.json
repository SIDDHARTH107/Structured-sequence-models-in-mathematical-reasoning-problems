    "message_2": "To find the probability that exactly 50 students will get an A grade in mathematics, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, getting an A grade)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of students, which is 300)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of students getting an A grade, which is 50)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of getting an A grade, which is 0.2)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of not getting an A grade, which is 0.8)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 50) = C(300, 50) * 0.2^50 * 0.8^(300-50)\n\nC(300, 50) = 300! / (50!(300-50)!) = 300! / (50!250!)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nC(300, 50) ≈ 3.098 × 10^40\n0.2^50 ≈ 1.126 × 10^-33\n0.8^250 ≈ 1.427 × 10^-8\n\nMultiplying these values together:\n\nP(X = 50) ≈ 3.098 × 10^40 * 1.126 × 10^-33 * 1.427 × 10^-8\nP(X = 50) ≈ 5.003 × 10^-1\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 50 students will get an A grade in mathematics is approximately 0.5003 or 50.03%."
