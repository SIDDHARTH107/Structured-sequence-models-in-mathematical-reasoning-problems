    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle is also known as its circumference. The formula to calculate the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nGiven that the radius of the basketball court is 28 feet, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(28)\n\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 28\n\nC ≈ 175.929\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circular basketball court is approximately 175.93 feet."
