    "message_1": "In a study of a medical condition, it was found that 1 out of every 25 individuals has this condition. If a doctor sees 200 patients, what is the probability that at least 10 of them have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success in a single trial\n- n is the total number of trials\n- k is the number of successful trials\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- p = 1/25 (probability of having the medical condition)\n- n = 200 (number of patients the doctor sees)\n- k = 10 (number of patients with the medical condition)\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 10 patients having the medical condition, which means we need to consider the probabilities of 10, 11, 12, ..., 200 patients having the medical condition and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the probability of fewer than 10 patients having the medical condition and subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least 10 patients having the medical condition.\n\nP(at least 10) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) - P(2) - ... - P(9)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = k) = C(200, k) * (1/25)^k * (24/25)^(200-k)\n\nCalculate P(0) to P(9) and sum them up:\n\nSum = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + ... + P(9)\n\nFinally, subtract the sum from 1:\n\nP(at least 10) = 1 - Sum\n\nThis will give you the probability that at least 10 out of 200 patients have the medical condition."
