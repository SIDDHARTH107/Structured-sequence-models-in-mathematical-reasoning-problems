The sample mean is 800 and the sample standard deviation is 100.\n\nUsing bootstrapping, estimate the population mean number of daily visitors to their website with a 90% confidence interval.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the population mean number of daily visitors to the website using bootstrapping with a 90% confidence interval, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000) from the original sample of 50 days, each with the same size (50) and with replacement.\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n3. Arrange the means in ascending order.\n4. Determine the 5th percentile and the 95th percentile of the bootstrap means, which will give us the 90% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data, we can't perform the bootstrapping procedure. However, we can approximate the confidence interval using the sample mean and sample standard deviation, assuming the distribution of daily visitors is approximately normal.\n\nThe formula for the confidence interval is:\n\nCI = sample mean ± (critical value * (sample standard deviation / √sample size))\n\nFor a 90% confidence interval, the critical value (z-score) is 1.645.\n\nCI = 800 ± (1.645 * (100 / √50))\n\nCI = 800 ± (1.645 * (100 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 800 ± (1.645 * 14.142)\n\nCI = 800 ± 23.273\n\nThe 90% confidence interval for the population mean number of daily visitors to the website is approximately 776.73 to 823.27."
