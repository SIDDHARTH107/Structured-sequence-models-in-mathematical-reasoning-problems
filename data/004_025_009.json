    "message_1": "A ball with a mass of 0.2 kg is thrown vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 20 meters/second. Find the maximum height the ball reaches before it falls back down to the ground. Assume air resistance is negligible. (Use the acceleration due to gravity, g=9.8 meters/second squared)",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height the ball reaches, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height)\nu = initial velocity (20 m/s)\na = acceleration (due to gravity, -9.8 m/s^2)\ns = displacement (the maximum height)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for s:\n\ns = (v^2 - u^2) / 2a\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = (0^2 - 20^2) / (2 * -9.8)\ns = (-400) / (-19.6)\ns = 20.41 meters\n\nThe maximum height the ball reaches before it falls back down to the ground is approximately 20.41 meters."
