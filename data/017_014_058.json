    "message_1": "Consider a group with 20 elements. If this group has exactly one element of order 2 and exactly one subgroup of order 4, what is the structure of this group? Is it isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20? Justify your answer.",
    "message_2": "Let G be the group with 20 elements. Since G has an element of order 2, let's denote this element as x, so x^2 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Also, let H be the unique subgroup of order 4 in G.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted as n_5, must divide the index 4 and satisfy n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1, which means there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup in G. Let's denote this subgroup as K.\n\nNow, let's consider the orders of elements in H and K. Since H has order 4, it must be isomorphic to either C4 (cyclic group of order 4) or C2 × C2 (Klein four-group). However, since there is only one element of order 2 in G, H cannot be isomorphic to C2 × C2, as it would have three elements of order 2. Therefore, H must be isomorphic to C4, and let's denote its generator as y, so y^4 = e.\n\nSince K is a Sylow 5-subgroup, it has order 5 and is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5. Let's denote its generator as z, so z^5 = e.\n\nNow, we have |H| = 4, |K| = 5, and gcd(4, 5) = 1. Since H and K are both normal subgroups in G (as they are unique), we have HK = KH. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the internal direct product H × K, which is a cyclic group of order 20, generated by the element yz.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20."
