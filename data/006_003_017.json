    "message_2": "There are 4 kings in a standard deck of 52 cards (one king for each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). To find the probability of drawing a king, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 (drawing any of the 4 kings), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (drawing any of the 52 cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a king is:\n\nProbability = 4/52 = 1/13 â‰ˆ 0.0769 or 7.69%"
