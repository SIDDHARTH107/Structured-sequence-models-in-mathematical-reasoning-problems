    "message_2": "To find the value of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 5 for x = 2, we simply substitute x with 2 and calculate the result.\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 5\nf(2) = 8 + 2(4) + 6 - 5\nf(2) = 8 + 8 + 6 - 5\nf(2) = 16 + 6 - 5\nf(2) = 22 - 5\nf(2) = 17\n\nSo, the value of the function f(x) for x = 2 is 17. In the context of higher-order logic, this result remains the same, as higher-order logic deals with the reasoning and relationships between mathematical functions and statements, but it does not change the actual calculations within the function itself."
