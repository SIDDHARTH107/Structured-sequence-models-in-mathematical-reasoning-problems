    "message_1": "A company is planning to produce two types of computers: laptop and desktop. The cost of producing a laptop is $500 and the cost of producing a desktop is $800. The company wants to produce at least 800 laptops and 600 desktops with a budget of $720,000. The profit for each laptop is $1,000 and the profit for each desktop is $1,500. How many laptops and desktops should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of laptops and y be the number of desktops produced.\n\nThe company's budget constraint is given by the equation:\n500x + 800y ≤ 720,000\n\nThe company wants to produce at least 800 laptops and 600 desktops, so we have the constraints:\nx ≥ 800\ny ≥ 600\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\nP(x, y) = 1000x + 1500y\n\nTo find the optimal production levels, we can use linear programming techniques. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 500x + 800y ≤ 720,000\n2. x ≥ 800\n3. y ≥ 600\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nVertex A: (800, 600) - Intersection of x = 800 and y = 600\nVertex B: (800, 750) - Intersection of x = 800 and 500x + 800y = 720,000\nVertex C: (1200, 600) - Intersection of y = 600 and 500x + 800y = 720,000\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 1000(800) + 1500(600) = 800,000 + 900,000 = 1,700,000\nP(B) = 1000(800) + 1500(750) = 800,000 + 1,125,000 = 1,925,000\nP(C) = 1000(1200) + 1500(600) = 1,200,000 + 900,000 = 2,100,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, where the company produces 1200 laptops and 600 desktops. The maximum profit is $2,100,000."
