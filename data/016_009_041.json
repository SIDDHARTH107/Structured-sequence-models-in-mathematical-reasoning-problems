    "message_2": "Let's denote the area of the initial square as A. After the first step, the middle square is removed, leaving 8 squares of equal area. Each of these squares has an area of A/9. \n\nNow, let's consider the infinite process. In each step, the area of the removed squares will be 1/9 of the remaining squares. Therefore, the total area of the remaining squares after each step can be represented as a geometric series:\n\nA_remaining = A * (8/9) + A * (8/9)^2 + A * (8/9)^3 + ...\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with the first term A * (8/9) and a common ratio of (8/9). To find the sum of an infinite geometric series, we can use the formula:\n\nSum = A_first_term / (1 - common_ratio)\n\nIn this case, the sum of the remaining squares' areas after the infinite process is:\n\nSum = (A * (8/9)) / (1 - (8/9))\n\nSum = (A * (8/9)) / (1/9)\n\nSum = A * (8/9) * 9\n\nSum = 8A\n\nSo, the total area of the squares remaining in the figure after the infinite process is 8 times the area of the initial square."
