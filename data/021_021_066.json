The cost function is given by:\n\nC(x) = 500x^2 + 400x + 1000\n\nwhere x represents the production quantity. \n\nUsing the cuckoo search algorithm, find the value of x that minimizes the cost function, and determine the corresponding minimum cost of production.",
    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism behavior of some cuckoo species. In this algorithm, we have a population of \"nests\" (solutions) and we iteratively update them to find the best solution. Here's a simplified version of the cuckoo search algorithm to solve the given problem:\n\n1. Initialize a population of nests (solutions) with random values of x.\n2. Evaluate the cost function C(x) for each nest.\n3. Generate a new solution (cuckoo) by applying a random walk (Levy flight) to one of the existing solutions.\n4. Evaluate the cost function C(x) for the new cuckoo.\n5. If the cuckoo's cost is better than the worst nest's cost, replace the worst nest with the cuckoo.\n6. Perform a fraction of the nests to be abandoned and replaced with new random solutions.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for a fixed number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm, we can find the value of x that minimizes the cost function and the corresponding minimum cost of production. Note that the algorithm may not always find the exact optimal solution, but it should provide a good approximation.\n\nFor this specific problem, however, it's worth noting that we can find the exact solution using calculus. By taking the derivative of the cost function and setting it to zero, we can find the optimal value of x:\n\nC'(x) = 1000x + 400 = 0\n\nx = -400 / 1000 = -0.4\n\nSince x represents the production quantity, a negative value doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the minimum cost occurs when x = 0:\n\nC(0) = 500(0)^2 + 400(0) + 1000 = 1000\n\nSo, the minimum cost of production is 1000 when the production quantity is 0."
