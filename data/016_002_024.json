    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is constructed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to each side. After each iteration, the number of sides of the snowflake increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nLet's denote the initial side length as s and the number of iterations as n. The perimeter P of the Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP = 3 * s * (4^n) / (3^n)\n\nIn this case, s = 20 and n = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 3 * 20 * (4^6) / (3^6)\nP = 60 * (4096) / (729)\nP = 60 * (5.625)\nP = 337.5\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve of side length 20 after the 6th iteration of the construction process is 337.5 units."
