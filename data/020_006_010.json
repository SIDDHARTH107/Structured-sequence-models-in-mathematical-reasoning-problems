    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products: chairs and tables. To produce a chair, 5 units of wood and 3 units of steel are required. To produce a table, 7 units of wood and 4 units of steel are required. The company has 70 units of wood and 42 units of steel available. However, the company can produce a maximum of 8 chairs and 6 tables per day. How many chairs and tables should the company produce to maximize its profit if the profit per chair is $10 and the profit per table is $15?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are as follows:\n\n1. Wood constraint: 5x + 7y ≤ 70\n2. Steel constraint: 3x + 4y ≤ 42\n3. Chair constraint: x ≤ 8\n4. Table constraint: y ≤ 6\n5. Non-negativity constraint: x, y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 5x + 7y ≤ 70\n   y ≤ (70 - 5x) / 7\n\n2. 3x + 4y ≤ 42\n   y ≤ (42 - 3x) / 4\n\n3. x ≤ 8\n\n4. y ≤ 6\n\n5. x, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of 5x + 7y = 70 and 3x + 4y = 42\n   Solving the system of equations:\n   5x + 7y = 70\n   3x + 4y = 42\n   Multiply the second equation by -5/3 to eliminate x:\n   -5x - 20/3y = -70\n   Add the two equations:\n   -5/3y = 0\n   y = 0\n   Substitute y back into the first equation:\n   5x = 70\n   x = 14\n   However, this point is not in the feasible region since x > 8.\n\n2. Intersection of x = 8 and y = 6\n   This point is (8, 6), which is in the feasible region.\n\n3. Intersection of x = 8 and 3x + 4y = 42\n   Substitute x = 8 into the second equation:\n   24 + 4y = 42\n   4y = 18\n   y = 4.5\n   This point is (8, 4.5), which is in the feasible region.\n\n4. Intersection of y = 6 and 3x + 4y = 42\n   Substitute y = 6 into the second equation:\n   3x + 24 = 42\n   3x = 18\n   x = 6\n   This point is (6, 6), which is in the feasible region.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(8, 6) = 10(8) + 15(6) = 80 + 90 = $170\n2. P(8, 4.5) = 10(8) + 15(4.5) = 80 + 67.5 = $147.5\n3. P(6, 6) = 10(6) + 15(6) = 60 + 90 = $150\n\nThe maximum profit is $170 when the company produces 8 chairs and 6 tables."
