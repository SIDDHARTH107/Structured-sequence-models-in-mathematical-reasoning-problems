Another useful tool is the Möbius transformation of the form:\n$$T(z)=\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$$\nwhich maps circles and lines to circles and lines.",
    "message_2": "To find the conformal map that transforms the unit disc $|z|\\leq 1$ onto the half-plane $\\text{Re}(w)>0$, such that $1$ maps to $1$, we can follow the hint and use the Möbius transformation.\n\nFirst, we need to find a conformal map that maps the unit disc $|z|\\leq 1$ onto the upper-half plane $\\text{Im}(w)>0$. As given in the hint, we can use the following conformal map:\n\n$$f(z)=\\frac{1+z}{1-z}$$\n\nNow, we need to find a conformal map that maps the upper-half plane $\\text{Im}(w)>0$ onto the half-plane $\\text{Re}(w)>0$. We can use a Möbius transformation of the form:\n\n$$T(w)=\\frac{aw+b}{cw+d}$$\n\nTo find the appropriate values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, we can use the fact that the imaginary axis maps to the real axis. Let's consider the following points on the imaginary axis: $i$, $-i$, and $\\infty$. We want to map these points to the real axis, so we have:\n\n$$T(i)=\\frac{ai+b}{ci+d}=x_1$$\n$$T(-i)=\\frac{-ai+b}{-ci+d}=x_2$$\n$$T(\\infty)=\\frac{a}{c}=x_3$$\n\nSince we want to map the unit disc onto the half-plane $\\text{Re}(w)>0$, we can choose $x_1=1$, $x_2=-1$, and $x_3=\\infty$. This gives us the following system of equations:\n\n$$\\frac{ai+b}{ci+d}=1$$\n$$\\frac{-ai+b}{-ci+d}=-1$$\n$$\\frac{a}{c}=\\infty$$\n\nFrom the third equation, we can deduce that $a\\neq 0$ and $c=0$. Now, we can rewrite the first two equations as:\n\n$$ai+b=ci+d$$\n$$-ai+b=-ci+d$$\n\nSince $c=0$, we have:\n\n$$ai+b=d$$\n$$-ai+b=d$$\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\n$$2b=2d$$\n$$b=d$$\n\nNow, we can choose $a=1$ and $b=1$ without loss of generality. This gives us the Möbius transformation:\n\n$$T(w)=\\frac{w+1}{w-1}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the desired conformal map by composing the two transformations:\n\n$$g(z)=T(f(z))=\\frac{f(z)+1}{f(z)-1}=\\frac{\\frac{1+z}{1-z}+1}{\\frac{1+z}{1-z}-1}$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$g(z)=\\frac{(1+z)+1(1-z)}{(1+z)-1(1-z)}=\\frac{2}{2z}=\\frac{1}{z}$$\n\nSo, the conformal map that transforms the unit disc $|z|\\leq 1$ onto the half-plane $\\text{Re}(w)>0$, such that $1$ maps to $1$, is:\n\n$$g(z)=\\frac{1}{z}$$"
