    "message_2": "According to Wilson's theorem, for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is a multiple of p. We can test this for the smallest prime numbers:\n\n1. For p = 2, (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is a multiple of 2.\n2. For p = 3, (3-1)! + 1 = 2! + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which is a multiple of 3.\n\nThus, the smallest prime number p such that (p-1)! + 1 is a multiple of p according to Wilson's theorem is p = 2."
