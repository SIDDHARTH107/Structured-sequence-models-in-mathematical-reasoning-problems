    "message_2": "To determine whether the given group G is isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6, we can analyze its properties and compare them with the properties of the three groups.\n\n1. Cyclic group C12: A group of order 12 generated by a single element. It has one element of order 12.\n\n2. Alternating group A4: A group of order 12 with three elements of order 2 and eight elements of order 3. It is the group of even permutations of 4 elements.\n\n3. Dihedral group D6: A group of order 12 with six elements of order 2 and two elements of order 6. It is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given group G:\n\n- The identity element (1) is present, and every element has an inverse (since the table is complete and every element appears in each row and column exactly once).\n\n- The order of each element can be determined by finding the smallest power that gives the identity (1). We have:\n\n  - Order of 1: 1\n  - Order of a: 2 (a * a = 1)\n  - Order of b: 3 (b * b * b = 1)\n  - Order of c: 2 (c * c = 1)\n  - Order of d: 6 (d * d * d * d * d * d = 1)\n  - Order of e: 6 (e * e * e * e * e * e = 1)\n  - Order of f: 2 (f * f = 1)\n  - Order of g: 2 (g * g = 1)\n  - Order of h: 2 (h * h = 1)\n  - Order of i: 2 (i * i = 1)\n  - Order of j: 2 (j * j = 1)\n  - Order of k: 2 (k * k = 1)\n\nFrom the orders of the elements, we can see that G has six elements of order 2, two elements of order 6, and one element of order 3. This matches the properties of the dihedral group D6. Therefore, the given group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6."
