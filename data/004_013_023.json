    "message_1": "A company produces and sells smartphones. The total cost of production is given by the function C(x) = 0.1x^3 - 2x^2 + 90x + 1000, where x is the number of smartphones produced. The revenue obtained by selling x number of phones is given by the function R(x) = 2x^2 + 3000x - 4000. Find the number of smartphones the company needs to produce to maximize its profit and determine the maximum profit that can be obtained.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of smartphones the company needs to produce to maximize its profit, we first need to find the profit function P(x). Profit is equal to revenue minus cost, so we have:\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x)\n\nSubstitute the given functions for R(x) and C(x):\n\nP(x) = (2x^2 + 3000x - 4000) - (0.1x^3 - 2x^2 + 90x + 1000)\n\nNow, simplify the profit function:\n\nP(x) = 2x^2 + 3000x - 4000 - 0.1x^3 + 2x^2 - 90x - 1000\nP(x) = -0.1x^3 + 4x^2 + 2910x - 5000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of P(x) by taking the derivative of P(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = -0.3x^2 + 8x + 2910\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n-0.3x^2 + 8x + 2910 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -0.3, b = 8, and c = 2910:\n\nx = (-8 ± √(8^2 - 4(-0.3)(2910))) / 2(-0.3)\n\nx = (-8 ± √(64 + 3492)) / -0.6\nx = (-8 ± √3556) / -0.6\n\nWe get two possible values for x:\n\nx1 = (-8 + √3556) / -0.6 ≈ 23.51\nx2 = (-8 - √3556) / -0.6 ≈ 412.49\n\nSince the number of smartphones produced must be a whole number, we can round x1 up to 24 and x2 down to 412. We need to check which of these values maximizes the profit by evaluating the second derivative of P(x):\n\nP''(x) = -0.6x + 8\n\nP''(24) = -0.6(24) + 8 = -14.4 < 0, which indicates a local maximum at x = 24.\nP''(412) = -0.6(412) + 8 = -243.2 < 0, which indicates a local maximum at x = 412.\n\nNow we need to compare the profit at these two points:\n\nP(24) = -0.1(24)^3 + 4(24)^2 + 2910(24) - 5000 ≈ 66,816\nP(412) = -0.1(412)^3 + 4(412)^2 + 2910(412) - 5000 ≈ 1,204,736\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained when the company produces 412 smartphones, and the maximum profit is approximately $1,204,736."
