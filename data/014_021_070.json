    "message_2": "To decrypt the message \"VJUMI\" using the 2x2 Hill cipher matrix key:\n\n```\nD T\nA M\n```\n\nwe first need to find the inverse of the matrix key modulo 26. Let's represent the matrix key as:\n\n```\nK = | D T |\n    | A M |\n```\n\nTo find the inverse of K, we need to calculate the determinant, adjugate, and modular inverse.\n\n1. Calculate the determinant of K:\n\ndet(K) = (D * M) - (A * T)\n\n2. Calculate the adjugate of K:\n\nadj(K) = | M -T |\n         |-A  D |\n\n3. Calculate the modular inverse of det(K) modulo 26:\n\nFind a number x such that (det(K) * x) % 26 = 1\n\n4. Multiply adj(K) by the modular inverse of det(K) modulo 26:\n\nK_inv = (modular inverse of det(K) modulo 26) * adj(K)\n\nNow that we have the inverse matrix key K_inv, we can decrypt the message \"VJUMI\". We will represent the message as a column vector and multiply it by K_inv modulo 26.\n\n1. Convert the message \"VJUMI\" to numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\nVJUMI -> 21 9 20 12 8\n\n2. Split the message into 2x1 column vectors:\n\n| 21 9  |\n| 20 12 |\n\n| 8 |\n| 20 |\n\n3. Multiply each column vector by K_inv modulo 26:\n\nK_inv * | 21 9  | % 26\n        | 20 12 |\n\nK_inv * | 8  | % 26\n        | 20 |\n\n4. Convert the resulting numerical values back to letters:\n\nThe decrypted message will be the original message before it was encrypted."
