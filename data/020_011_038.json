    "message_1": "A factory produces two different products, A and B. The production process for A requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of assembly time, while the production process for B requires 2 hours of machine time and 5 hours of assembly time. The factory has 40 hours of machine time and 35 hours of assembly time available each week. The profit from product A is $20 per unit and the profit from product B is $25 per unit. How many units of products A and B should the factory produce each week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are given by the available machine and assembly time:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 40 (machine time constraint)\n2x + 5y ≤ 35 (assembly time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 20x + 25y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 40\n2y ≤ -3x + 40\ny ≤ -1.5x + 20\n\n2x + 5y ≤ 35\n5y ≤ -2x + 35\ny ≤ -0.4x + 7\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these two inequalities, along with x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (since we cannot produce a negative number of units).\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = -1.5x + 20 and y = -0.4x + 7:\n-1.5x + 20 = -0.4x + 7\n1.1x = 13\nx = 13/1.1 ≈ 11.82\ny = -0.4(11.82) + 7 ≈ 2.27\n\n2. Intersection of y = -1.5x + 20 and x = 0:\ny = -1.5(0) + 20\ny = 20\n\n3. Intersection of y = -0.4x + 7 and x = 0:\ny = -0.4(0) + 7\ny = 7\n\n4. Intersection of y = -1.5x + 20 and y = 0:\n0 = -1.5x + 20\nx = 20/1.5 ≈ 13.33\n\n5. Intersection of y = -0.4x + 7 and y = 0:\n0 = -0.4x + 7\nx = 7/0.4 = 17.5\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(11.82, 2.27) = 20(11.82) + 25(2.27) ≈ 236.4 + 56.75 ≈ 293.15\n2. P(0, 20) = 20(0) + 25(20) = 500\n3. P(0, 7) = 20(0) + 25(7) = 175\n4. P(13.33, 0) = 20(13.33) + 25(0) ≈ 266.6\n5. P(17.5, 0) = 20(17.5) + 25(0) = 350\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (0, 20), where the factory should produce 0 units of product A and 20 units of product B. The maximum profit is $500 per week."
