    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince G has prime order 17, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 17. Since 17 is prime, the only divisors of 17 are 1 and 17. Therefore, the order of any non-identity element in G must be 17.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary non-identity element g in G. Since the order of g is 17, the set {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^16} contains 17 distinct elements (including the identity element, g^0 = e). Since G has 17 elements, this set must be equal to G. In other words, every element of G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nThus, G is cyclic, and g is a generator of the group."
