    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the information, we have:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 175 cm\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 10 cm\nSample size (n) = 50\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 10 / √50 ≈ 1.414\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 170 cm. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (sample mean - population mean) / SE\n\nz = (170 - 175) / 1.414 ≈ -3.536\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that corresponds to this z-score. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the probability. The probability for a z-score of -3.536 is approximately 0.0002.\n\nSo, the probability that the average height of the new group of 50 male students is less than 170 cm is approximately 0.02% or 0.0002."
