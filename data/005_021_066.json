    "message_1": "An online retailer claims that its returns rate is no more than 5%. A sample of 100 purchases was taken, and 9 of them were returned. Using bootstrapping, determine if there is evidence to suggest that the retailer's returns rate is higher than what they claim.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is evidence to suggest that the retailer's returns rate is higher than what they claim using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the observed return rate from the sample.\n2. Generate a large number of bootstrap samples by resampling with replacement from the original sample.\n3. Calculate the return rate for each bootstrap sample.\n4. Compare the observed return rate to the distribution of return rates from the bootstrap samples to determine the p-value.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the observed return rate from the sample.\nObserved return rate = (Number of returns) / (Total number of purchases) = 9 / 100 = 0.09 or 9%\n\nStep 2: Generate a large number of bootstrap samples.\nLet's generate 10,000 bootstrap samples by resampling with replacement from the original sample.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the return rate for each bootstrap sample.\nFor each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples, calculate the return rate as the number of returns divided by the total number of purchases.\n\nStep 4: Compare the observed return rate to the distribution of return rates from the bootstrap samples to determine the p-value.\nCount the number of bootstrap samples with a return rate greater than or equal to the observed return rate (9%). Divide this count by the total number of bootstrap samples (10,000) to obtain the p-value.\n\nIf the p-value is less than the significance level (typically 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis that the true return rate is no more than 5% and conclude that there is evidence to suggest that the retailer's returns rate is higher than what they claim.\n\nNote: The actual calculations and comparisons would require programming or statistical software to perform the bootstrapping process. The explanation provided here outlines the conceptual steps to be followed."
