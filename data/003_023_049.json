    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\n|A x B| = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\n\nwhere |A x B| is the magnitude of the cross product, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nGiven the magnitudes of A and B are 5 and 7 respectively, and the angle between them is 40 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n|A x B| = 5 * 7 * sin(40°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the sine of 40 degrees. Using a calculator, we get:\n\nsin(40°) ≈ 0.6428\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n|A x B| = 5 * 7 * 0.6428 ≈ 22.5\n\nSo, the magnitude of the cross product of vectors A and B is approximately 22.5."
