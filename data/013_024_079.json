    "message_1": "A group of 6 volunteers is discussing whether or not to organize a charity event. If at least 4 of them agree, they will organize the event, otherwise, they won't. Each of the volunteers has a personal value of attending the event, which ranges between 0 and 10 with increments of 1 (0,1,2,...,10). The value represents how much they value attending the event. If they attend the event, they will receive that amount of personal value. If they don't attend the event, they will receive 0. The event is costly to organize and will cost exactly 20. What is the best action for each volunteer to take?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best action for each volunteer, we need to consider the total personal value gained by the group if the event is organized and compare it to the cost of organizing the event. If the total personal value is greater than or equal to the cost, then it is worth organizing the event. Otherwise, it is not.\n\nLet's consider all possible combinations of personal values for the 6 volunteers:\n\n1. If all 6 volunteers have a personal value of 10, the total personal value is 60, which is greater than the cost of 20. In this case, it is worth organizing the event.\n\n2. If 5 volunteers have a personal value of 10 and 1 volunteer has a personal value of 0, the total personal value is 50, which is still greater than the cost of 20. In this case, it is also worth organizing the event.\n\n3. If 4 volunteers have a personal value of 10 and 2 volunteers have a personal value of 0, the total personal value is 40, which is still greater than the cost of 20. In this case, it is also worth organizing the event.\n\n4. If 3 volunteers have a personal value of 10 and 3 volunteers have a personal value of 0, the total personal value is 30, which is greater than the cost of 20. However, since at least 4 volunteers need to agree to organize the event, this combination will not lead to the event being organized.\n\n5. If 2 volunteers have a personal value of 10 and 4 volunteers have a personal value of 0, the total personal value is 20, which is equal to the cost of 20. In this case, it is worth organizing the event, but only if at least 4 volunteers agree to do so.\n\n6. If 1 volunteer has a personal value of 10 and 5 volunteers have a personal value of 0, the total personal value is 10, which is less than the cost of 20. In this case, it is not worth organizing the event.\n\n7. If all 6 volunteers have a personal value of 0, the total personal value is 0, which is less than the cost of 20. In this case, it is not worth organizing the event.\n\nBased on these scenarios, the best action for each volunteer to take depends on the personal values of the other volunteers. If the total personal value of the group is greater than or equal to 20 and at least 4 volunteers agree to organize the event, then it is worth organizing the event. Otherwise, it is not.\n\nIn general, volunteers with higher personal values should be more inclined to agree to organize the event, while volunteers with lower personal values should be less inclined. However, the final decision will depend on the specific personal values of each volunteer and the willingness of at least 4 volunteers to organize the event."
