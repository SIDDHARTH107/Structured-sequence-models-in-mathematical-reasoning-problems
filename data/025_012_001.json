    "message_2": "To find the equation of the elliptic curve that passes through the given points, we will use the general equation of an elliptic curve:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B\n\nWe will use the given points to form a system of equations and solve for A and B.\n\n1. (0, 1): 1^2 = 0^3 + A(0) + B => B = 1\n2. (2, 5): 5^2 = 2^3 + A(2) + 1 => 25 = 8 + 2A + 1 => 2A = 16 => A = 8\n3. (-2, 5): 5^2 = (-2)^3 + A(-2) + 1 => 25 = -8 - 16 + 1 => This equation is satisfied with A = 8 and B = 1\n4. (5, 26): 26^2 = 5^3 + A(5) + 1 => 676 = 125 + 40 + 1 => This equation is satisfied with A = 8 and B = 1\n5. (-5, 26): 26^2 = (-5)^3 + A(-5) + 1 => 676 = -125 - 40 + 1 => This equation is satisfied with A = 8 and B = 1\n\nAll the given points satisfy the elliptic curve equation with A = 8 and B = 1. Therefore, the equation of the elliptic curve is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 8x + 1"
