    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, after each iteration, the number of self-similar pieces (N) is 2, and the scaling factor (r) is 3 (since we remove the middle third of each line segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Cantor dust is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.6309, regardless of the original line segment length or the number of iterations."
