    "message_1": "Suppose that in a certain population, 20% of individuals have a genetic susceptibility to a particular disease. If a random sample of 100 individuals from this population is taken, what is the probability that at least 25% of them have the genetic susceptibility to the disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- p = 0.20 (the probability of an individual having the genetic susceptibility)\n- n = 100 (the number of individuals in the sample)\n- k = 25 (we want to find the probability of at least 25 individuals having the genetic susceptibility)\n\nHowever, since we want to find the probability of at least 25 individuals having the genetic susceptibility, we need to find the probability of 25, 26, 27, ..., 100 individuals having the genetic susceptibility and sum those probabilities.\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = P(X = 25) + P(X = 26) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nTo find the probability of each of these events, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(100, k) * (0.20)^k * (0.80)^(100-k)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each k from 25 to 100 and sum them:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = Σ [C(100, k) * (0.20)^k * (0.80)^(100-k)] for k = 25 to 100\n\nUsing a calculator or software that can handle binomial probabilities, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) ≈ 0.8913\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25% of the individuals in the sample have the genetic susceptibility to the disease is approximately 0.8913 or 89.13%."
