    "message_1": "A student wants to select 5 books from a collection of 12 distinct books on the shelf. How many ways can the student select the books given that order does not matter? Use Stirling numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Using Stirling numbers to solve this problem is not the most efficient method, as Stirling numbers are used for counting the number of ways to partition a set into a certain number of non-empty subsets. Instead, we can use combinations to solve this problem, as it deals with selecting a certain number of items from a larger set without considering the order.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 books from a collection of 12 distinct books can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of books (12 in this case) and k is the number of books to be selected (5 in this case).\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!(12-5)!)\n= 12! / (5!7!)\n= (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n= 792\n\nSo, there are 792 ways for the student to select 5 books from the collection of 12 distinct books."
