    "message_2": "We can apply the Maximum Modulus Principle to solve this problem. The Maximum Modulus Principle states that if a function is holomorphic (analytic) in a bounded domain and continuous up to the boundary, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is an entire function, it is holomorphic on the entire complex plane. Let's consider the closed disk $D = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\leq 2\\}$. The function $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the interior of this disk and continuous up to the boundary, which is the circle $|z| = 2$. By the Maximum Modulus Principle, the maximum of $|f(z)|$ in the disk $D$ is attained on the boundary, i.e., $|f(z)| \\leq 3$ for every $z$ with $|z| = 2$.\n\nNow, since $f(z)$ is continuous, we have $|f(0)| \\leq 3$ for $z = 0$. Therefore, the maximum possible value of $|f(0)|$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
