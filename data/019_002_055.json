    "message_2": "Using predicate logic, the statement \"There exists an odd number greater than 10\" can be written as:\n\n∃x (O(x) ∧ x > 10)\n\nHere, O(x) represents the predicate \"x is an odd number.\"\n\nA math student can solve the statement by finding an odd number greater than 10, such as 11 or 13, to prove that the statement is true. For example, let x = 11. Since 11 is an odd number and greater than 10, the statement is true."
