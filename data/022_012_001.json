    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz + 2 = 0\nz = -2\n\nSo, the function f(z) has a single zero at z = -2.\n\nTo find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz - 3 = 0\nz = 3\n\nSo, the function f(z) has a single pole at z = 3.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the zeros and poles are isolated or essential. In a meromorphic function, zeros and poles are always isolated. This is because a meromorphic function is holomorphic (analytic) everywhere except at its poles. Therefore, in a neighborhood of a zero or a pole, the function is holomorphic, and the zero or pole is an isolated singularity.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) = (z+2)/(z-3) has a single zero at z = -2 and a single pole at z = 3, both of which are isolated."
