    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be found using the formula: Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2. \n\nGiven the side length of 5 cm, the surface area can be calculated as follows:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (5 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 6 * 25 cm^2\nSurface Area = 150 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
