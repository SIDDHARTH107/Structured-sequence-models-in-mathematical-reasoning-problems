Let's check the intersection of elements in τ:\n   - Intersection of {} and any other element in τ will be {} (which is in τ).\n   - Intersection of {1, 2, 3} and any other element in τ will be that element itself (which is in τ).\n   - Intersection of {1} and {2, 3} is the empty set {} (which is in τ).\n   \n   The intersection of any finite number of elements in τ is an element of τ.
