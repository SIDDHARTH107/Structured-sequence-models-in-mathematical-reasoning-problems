    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x + y^2$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (3x^2 - 3, 2y)$\n\nSetting the gradient equal to the zero vector, we get:\n\n$3x^2 - 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2y = 0$\n\nSolving for $x$ and $y$, we get:\n\n$x^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = 0$\n\nSo, the critical points are $(1, 0)$ and $(-1, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points using Morse theory. To do this, we will compute the Hessian matrix of $f$, which is given by:\n\n$H_f(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we will evaluate the Hessian matrix at the critical points and compute its eigenvalues.\n\n1. At $(1, 0)$:\n\n$H_f(1, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are $\\lambda_1 = 6$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$, both of which are positive. According to Morse theory, since both eigenvalues are positive, the critical point $(1, 0)$ is a local minimum.\n\n2. At $(-1, 0)$:\n\n$H_f(-1, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-6 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are $\\lambda_1 = -6$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, according to Morse theory, the critical point $(-1, 0)$ is a saddle point.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x + y^2$ has two critical points: $(1, 0)$, which is a local minimum, and $(-1, 0)$, which is a saddle point."
