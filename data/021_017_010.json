    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using the differential evolution algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions randomly within the given range [0, 10].\n2. For each candidate solution, create a trial vector by combining the weighted difference of two other randomly chosen solutions with a third randomly chosen solution.\n3. Perform crossover between the candidate solution and the trial vector to create a new candidate solution.\n4. Evaluate the new candidate solution using the objective function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6.\n5. Replace the original candidate solution with the new candidate solution if the new solution has a lower objective function value.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for a certain number of iterations or until convergence is reached.\n\nAfter running the differential evolution algorithm, we can obtain the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x. However, the results may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm.\n\nIn this case, the true minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 can be found analytically by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 5 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of f(x) by plugging x = 2.5 back into the original function:\n\nf(2.5) = (2.5)^2 - 5(2.5) + 6 = 6.25 - 12.5 + 6 = -0.25\n\nSo, the true minimum value of f(x) is -0.25, and the corresponding value of x is 2.5. The differential evolution algorithm should provide a result close to these values."
