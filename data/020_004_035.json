    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products type A and type B. The profit for each type A product sold is $5 and for each type B product sold is $7. The production of type A product requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while the production of type B product requires 1 hour of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The total available labor time is 100 hours and the total available machine time is 120 hours. Determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by the manufacturer per day subject to the constraints on labor and machine resources.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A products and y be the number of type B products produced.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n2x + y ≤ 100 (labor time constraint)\n3x + 4y ≤ 120 (machine time constraint)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y = 100\ny = 100 - 2x\n\n2. 3x + 4y = 120\ny = (120 - 3x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 60), and (40, 20).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 30) = 5(0) + 7(30) = 210\n3. P(20, 60) = 5(20) + 7(60) = 100 + 420 = 520\n4. P(40, 20) = 5(40) + 7(20) = 200 + 140 = 340\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at the point (20, 60), with a profit of $520 per day. The manufacturer should produce 20 units of type A products and 60 units of type B products to maximize their profit."
