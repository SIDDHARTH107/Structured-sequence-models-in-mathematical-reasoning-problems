    "message_2": "To find the circumference of the circular garden, we can use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter\n\nThe diameter of the garden is 12 meters. Therefore, the circumference is:\n\nC = π * 12\n\nUsing the value of π as approximately 3.14, we get:\n\nC = 3.14 * 12\nC ≈ 37.68 meters\n\nThe circumference of the garden is approximately 37.68 meters."
