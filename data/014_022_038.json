    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"MATHS\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair square.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the keyword: MATHS (no duplicates in this case)\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet in order (excluding J, since I and J are combined in the same cell):\n\n   M  A  T  H  S\n   B  C  D  E  F\n   G  I  K  L  N\n   O  P  Q  R  U\n   V  W  X  Y  Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message by following the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. NV -> DE\n2. QN -> CR\n3. RJ -> YP\n4. MW -> TH\n5. NJ -> IS\n6. RJ -> YP\n7. RF -> TO\n8. XN -> NS\n\nThe decrypted message is: \"DECRYPT THIS MESSAGE\"."
