    "message_2": "To prove that f is a polynomial of degree at most 2, we will use the Cauchy's integral formula for the n-th derivative of f:\n\nf^(n)(a) = n!/(2πi) * ∫(f(z)/(z-a)^(n+1))dz, where the integral is taken over a circle centered at a with a small radius r.\n\nLet's consider the n-th derivative of f at 0, f^(n)(0), for n ≥ 3. We have:\n\nf^(n)(0) = n!/(2πi) * ∫(f(z)/z^(n+1))dz\n\nNow, we use the inequality |f(z)| ≤ M|z|^2:\n\n|f^(n)(0)| = |n!/(2πi) * ∫(f(z)/z^(n+1))dz| ≤ n!/(2π) * ∫(|f(z)|/|z^(n+1)|)|dz| ≤ n!/(2π) * ∫(M|z|^2/|z^(n+1)|)|dz|\n\nThe last integral is taken over a circle of radius r centered at 0. We can simplify the expression inside the integral:\n\n|f^(n)(0)| ≤ n!/(2π) * ∫(M/|z^(n-1)|)|dz|\n\nNow, let's compute the integral:\n\n∫(M/|z^(n-1)|)|dz| = M * ∫(1/|z^(n-1)|)|dz|\n\nFor n ≥ 3, the integral converges, and its value is:\n\n∫(1/|z^(n-1)|)|dz| = 2πr^(2-n)/(n-2)\n\nThus, we have:\n\n|f^(n)(0)| ≤ n!/(2π) * M * 2πr^(2-n)/(n-2)\n\nAs r → 0, we have r^(2-n) → 0, so:\n\n|f^(n)(0)| ≤ 0\n\nThis implies that f^(n)(0) = 0 for all n ≥ 3. Therefore, f has at most a second-degree polynomial, i.e., f(z) = a + bz + cz^2 for some complex constants a, b, and c.\n\nNow, we are given that f(2+i) = 3-4i. Plugging this into the polynomial, we get:\n\n3-4i = a + b(2+i) + c(2+i)^2\n\nTo find all possible values of f(1), we need to find f(1) = a + b + c. We can rewrite the equation above as:\n\n3-4i = a + 2b + bi + 4c + 4ci - c\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we have:\n\n3 = a + 2b + 4c - c (1)\n-4 = b + 4c (2)\n\nFrom (2), we have b = -4 - 4c. Substituting this into (1), we get:\n\n3 = a - 8 - 8c + 3c\na = 11 + 5c\n\nNow, f(1) = a + b + c = 11 + 5c - 4 - 4c + c = 7 + 2c. Since c can be any complex number, f(1) can take any value in the form 7 + 2c, where c is a complex number."
