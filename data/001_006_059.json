    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 3x² - 6x + 2, we can use the vertex formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = 3 and b = -6.\n\nx = -(-6) / 2(3)\nx = 6 / 6\nx = 1\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = 3(1)² - 6(1) + 2\ny = 3 - 6 + 2\ny = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (1, -1).\n\nNext, we'll find the x-intercepts by setting y = 0 and solving for x:\n\n0 = 3x² - 6x + 2\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 3, b = -6, and c = 2.\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)² - 4(3)(2))) / 2(3)\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 6\nx = (6 ± √12) / 6\nx = (6 ± 2√3) / 6\n\nWe can simplify this further by factoring out a 2:\n\nx = (3 ± √3) / 3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = (3 + √3) / 3 and x = (3 - √3) / 3.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we can set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 3(0)² - 6(0) + 2\ny = 2\n\nSo, the y-intercept is y = 2.\n\nNow, we can graph the equation using the vertex, x-intercepts, and y-intercept:\n\n1. Plot the vertex (1, -1).\n2. Plot the x-intercepts ((3 + √3) / 3, 0) and ((3 - √3) / 3, 0).\n3. Plot the y-intercept (0, 2).\n4. Draw a parabola through these points.\n\nThe graph of the quadratic equation y = 3x² - 6x + 2 will be a parabola with vertex (1, -1), x-intercepts ((3 + √3) / 3, 0) and ((3 - √3) / 3, 0), and y-intercept (0, 2)."
