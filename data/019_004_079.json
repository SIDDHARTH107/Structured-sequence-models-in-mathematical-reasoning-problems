    "message_2": "Using temporal logic, we can represent the statement \"John will run 365 km in a year\" as follows:\n\nLet R(t) represent the proposition \"John runs 5 km on day t.\"\n\nThe statement \"John will run 365 km in a year\" can be represented as:\n\n∑[R(t) * 5] from t=1 to t=365 = 365 * 5\n\nHere, the summation symbol ∑ represents the sum of the distances John runs each day, from day 1 (January 1st) to day 365 (December 31st). The expression R(t) * 5 represents the distance John runs on day t, which is 5 km. The sum of all these distances should equal 365 * 5, which is the total distance John runs in a year (1825 km)."
