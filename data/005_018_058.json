    "message_2": "To find the probability that a patient with this medical condition will survive for at least 4 years, we need to know how many patients survived for at least 4 years out of the initial 100 patients.\n\nHowever, the information provided only tells us the number of patients who survived and died after 3 years. We do not have enough information to determine the probability of a patient surviving for at least 4 years."
