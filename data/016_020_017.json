    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Sierpinski pyramid or Tetrix, is a fractal created by repeatedly applying a simple rule to a tetrahedron. In each iteration, each tetrahedron is replaced by four smaller tetrahedra, which are connected at their vertices to form a larger tetrahedron.\n\nThe total number of triangles in the nth iteration of the Sierpinski tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula:\n\nT(n) = 4^n\n\nwhere T(n) is the total number of triangles in the nth iteration and n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 8th iteration, we have:\n\nT(8) = 4^8 = 65,536\n\nSo, there are 65,536 triangles in the 8th iteration of the Sierpinski tetrahedron construction."
