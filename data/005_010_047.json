    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we need to find the probability that the sample mean lifespan exceeds 1050 hours given the information we have about the population mean and standard deviation. We can use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to approximate the distribution of the sample mean.\n\nAccording to the CLT, the distribution of the sample mean (x̄) will be approximately normal with a mean (μ) equal to the population mean and a standard deviation (σ_x̄) equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, μ = 1000 hours, σ = 100 hours, and n = 50. So, we can calculate the standard deviation of the sample mean:\n\nσ_x̄ = σ / √n = 100 / √50 ≈ 14.14 hours\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean lifespan (x̄) exceeds 1050 hours. To do this, we can standardize the value of 1050 hours using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σ_x̄ = (1050 - 1000) / 14.14 ≈ 3.53\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a z-score is greater than 3.53. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area to the right of 3.53, which represents the probability we are looking for.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the area to the right of 3.53 is approximately 0.0002. Therefore, the probability that the sample mean lifespan exceeds 1050 hours is approximately 0.0002, or 0.02%."
