    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is not typically used to formulate numerical problems with precise solutions. Deontic logic is a branch of logic that is concerned with the study of obligation, permission, and related concepts. It is more concerned with the logical structure and relationships between propositions that express these concepts than with solving numerical problems. Can I assist you with anything else?",
    "message_2": "It seems that you have repeated the same statement multiple times. If you have any mathematical problems or questions related to other topics, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help."
