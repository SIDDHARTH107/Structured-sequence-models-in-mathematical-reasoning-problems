    "message_2": "To find the vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b / 2a. Then, we can plug this x-coordinate back into the equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\nIn this case, the equation is y = 2x² + 8x - 5, so a = 2, b = 8, and c = -5.\n\nFirst, let's find the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\nx = -b / 2a\nx = -8 / (2 * 2)\nx = -8 / 4\nx = -2\n\nNow, let's plug this x-coordinate back into the equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex:\n\ny = 2(-2)² + 8(-2) - 5\ny = 2(4) - 16 - 5\ny = 8 - 16 - 5\ny = -13\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 8x - 5 is (-2, -13)."
