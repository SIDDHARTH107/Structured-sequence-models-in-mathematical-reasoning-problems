    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) Δ C, we first need to find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the symmetric difference of the result with C.\n\nThe symmetric difference of two sets, A and B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in both. Mathematically, it can be represented as (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\n1. Find A Δ B:\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n(A Δ B) = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 4}\n\nNow we have (A Δ B) = {1, 4}.\n\n2. Find (A Δ B) Δ C:\n(A Δ B) = {1, 4}\nC = {3, 4, 5}\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n(A Δ B) ∩ C = {4}\n((A Δ B) Δ C) = ((A Δ B) ∪ C) - ((A Δ B) ∩ C) = {1, 3, 5}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) Δ C is {1, 3, 5}."
