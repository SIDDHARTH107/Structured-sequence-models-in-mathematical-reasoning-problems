To find the eigenvectors, plug each eigenvalue into the equation (A - λI)x = 0 and solve for x.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the eigenvalues by solving the equation det(A - λI) = 0.\n\nA - λI = [3 - λ, 2; 4, 1 - λ]\n\nThe determinant of a 2x2 matrix is given by the formula det(M) = ad - bc, where M = [a, b; c, d]. So, we have:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)(1 - λ) - (2)(4) = λ^2 - 4λ - 5\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the equation λ^2 - 4λ - 5 = 0. Factoring the equation, we get:\n\n(λ - 5)(λ + 1) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 5 and λ2 = -1.\n\nNext, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 5:\n\n(A - λ1I)x = (A - 5I)x = 0\n[3 - 5, 2; 4, 1 - 5]x = [-2, 2; 4, -4]x = 0\n\nWe can simplify this system of equations to:\n\n-2x1 + 2x2 = 0\n4x1 - 4x2 = 0\n\nBoth equations are equivalent, so we can use the first one:\n\nx2 = x1\n\nLet x1 = 1, then x2 = 1. So, the eigenvector for λ1 = 5 is x1 = [1; 1].\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n\n(A - λ2I)x = (A + I)x = 0\n[3 + 1, 2; 4, 1 + 1]x = [4, 2; 4, 2]x = 0\n\nWe can simplify this system of equations to:\n\n4x1 + 2x2 = 0\n4x1 + 2x2 = 0\n\nBoth equations are equivalent, so we can use the first one:\n\n4x1 = -2x2\nx1 = -1/2 * x2\n\nLet x2 = 2, then x1 = -1. So, the eigenvector for λ2 = -1 is x2 = [-1; 2].\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues are 5 and -1, and their corresponding eigenvectors are [1; 1] and [-1; 2]."
