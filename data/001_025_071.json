    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the given equation:\n\n(2 + 3𝑖)𝑧 - (4 − 𝑖) = (4 + 5𝑖)𝑧 - (8 − 3𝑖)\n\nNow, let's substitute 𝑧 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖:\n\n(2 + 3𝑖)(𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖) - (4 − 𝑖) = (4 + 5𝑖)(𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖) - (8 − 3𝑖)\n\nNow, let's expand the equation:\n\n(2𝑎 - 3𝑏 + (2𝑏 + 3𝑎)𝑖) - (4 - 𝑖) = (4𝑎 - 5𝑏 + (4𝑏 + 5𝑎)𝑖) - (8 - 3𝑖)\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n(2𝑎 - 3𝑏 + 2𝑏 + 3𝑎 - 4 + 𝑖) = (4𝑎 - 5𝑏 + 4𝑏 + 5𝑎 - 8 + 3𝑖)\n\n(5𝑎 - 𝑏 - 4 + 𝑖) = (9𝑎 - 𝑏 - 8 + 3𝑖)\n\nNow, let's equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal parts: 5𝑎 - 𝑏 - 4 = 9𝑎 - 𝑏 - 8\nImaginary parts: 𝑖 = 3𝑖\n\nFrom the imaginary parts, we can see that the equation is true, so we don't need to do anything with it.\n\nNow, let's solve the real parts equation:\n\n5𝑎 - 𝑏 - 4 = 9𝑎 - 𝑏 - 8\n\nAdd 𝑏 to both sides:\n\n5𝑎 - 4 = 9𝑎 - 8\n\nSubtract 5𝑎 from both sides:\n\n-4 = 4𝑎 - 8\n\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n\n4 = 4𝑎\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n𝑎 = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of 𝑎, let's find the value of 𝑏. We can use the real parts equation:\n\n5𝑎 - 𝑏 - 4 = 9𝑎 - 𝑏 - 8\n\nSubstitute 𝑎 = 1:\n\n5(1) - 𝑏 - 4 = 9(1) - 𝑏 - 8\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 - 𝑏 = 1 - 𝑏\n\nThis equation is true for any value of 𝑏, which means 𝑏 can be any real number.\n\nSo, the solution for the equation is 𝑧 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖 = 1 + 𝑏𝑖, where 𝑏 ∈ ℝ."
