On Friday, Alex did not study at all. Did he get an A in his math exam? Answer in \"yes\" or \"no\" and provide a logical explanation for your answer.",
    "message_2": "no\n\nThe statement says that Alex needs to study for at least 5 hours every day to get an A in his math exam. However, on Wednesday, he studied for only 4 hours, and on Friday, he did not study at all. Since he did not meet the condition of studying for at least 5 hours every day, we cannot conclude that he will get an A in his math exam."
