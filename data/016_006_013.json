    "message_2": "After the first transformation, the length of the stem segment would be the product of the initial length and the contraction ratio. In this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and the contraction ratio is 0.85.\n\nLength after first transformation = Initial length × Contraction ratio\nLength after first transformation = 1 × 0.85\nLength after first transformation = 0.85 units"
