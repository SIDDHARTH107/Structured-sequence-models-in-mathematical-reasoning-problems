    "message_2": "To find the volume of a regular tetrahedron in hyperbolic space with an edge length of 3 units, we can use Dyson's formula. Dyson's formula is given by:\n\nV = (1/2) * (π - α) * (π - β) * (π - γ) * R^3\n\nwhere V is the volume, α, β, and γ are the dihedral angles of the tetrahedron, and R is the circumradius.\n\nFor a regular tetrahedron in hyperbolic space, all dihedral angles are equal, and we can denote them as α. The dihedral angle α can be calculated using the following formula:\n\ncosh(α) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) + sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(θ)\n\nwhere a and b are the edge lengths, and θ is the angle between the edges. For a regular tetrahedron, a = b = 3 units, and θ = 60 degrees (π/3 radians).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ncosh(α) = cosh(3) * cosh(3) + sinh(3) * sinh(3) * cos(π/3)\ncosh(α) ≈ 10.0677\n\nNow, we need to find the circumradius R. We can use the following formula:\n\ncosh(R) = (cosh(α) + 1) / 2\ncosh(R) ≈ (10.0677 + 1) / 2\ncosh(R) ≈ 5.53385\n\nNow, we can find the volume using Dyson's formula:\n\nV = (1/2) * (π - α) * (π - α) * (π - α) * R^3\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse hyperbolic cosine of α and R:\n\nα ≈ arccosh(10.0677) ≈ 2.73043\nR ≈ arccosh(5.53385) ≈ 2.29243\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Dyson's formula:\n\nV ≈ (1/2) * (π - 2.73043) * (π - 2.73043) * (π - 2.73043) * 2.29243^3\nV ≈ 1.10497 * 1.10497 * 1.10497 * 12.0714\nV ≈ 16.2996 cubic units\n\nSo, the volume of a regular tetrahedron in hyperbolic space with an edge length of 3 units is approximately 16.2996 cubic units."
