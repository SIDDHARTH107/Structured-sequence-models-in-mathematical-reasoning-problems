    "message_2": "To evaluate the complex integral using Cauchy's theorem, we first need to find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z + 6) / (z^2 - 16) and determine if they lie inside the contour C.\n\nThe function has singularities at z = Â±4, since the denominator becomes zero at these points. The contour C is the unit circle centered at the origin, so neither of these singularities is inside the contour. Therefore, by Cauchy's theorem, the integral of f(z) over the contour C is equal to zero.\n\nSo, the complex integral of (z + 6) / (z^2 - 16) over the unit circle C is 0."
