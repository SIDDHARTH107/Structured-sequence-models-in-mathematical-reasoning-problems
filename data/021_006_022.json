    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the finite element method, we first need to discretize the spatial domain and approximate the solution using basis functions. We will use linear basis functions and the Galerkin method for this problem.\n\n1. Discretize the spatial domain:\n\nDivide the rod into N = 10 equal intervals, with Δx = L/N = 1/10. The nodes will be x_i = iΔx for i = 0, 1, ..., 10.\n\n2. Approximate the solution:\n\nLet u(x, t) ≈ U(x, t) = ∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)], where φ_i(x) are linear basis functions, and U_i(t) are the coefficients to be determined.\n\n3. Apply the Galerkin method:\n\nMultiply the PDE by a test function v(x) and integrate over the domain (0, 1):\n\n∫[v(x) * u_t] dx = k ∫[v(x) * u_{xx}] dx + ∫[v(x) * f(x)] dx\n\n4. Integrate by parts:\n\n∫[v(x) * u_t] dx = -k ∫[v'(x) * u_x] dx + k[v(x) * u_x]_0^1 + ∫[v(x) * f(x)] dx\n\n5. Apply boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, t) = 0 and u(1, t) = 0, so the boundary terms vanish.\n\n6. Substitute the approximation U(x, t):\n\n∫[v(x) * ∑[U_i'(t) * φ_i(x)]] dx = -k ∫[v'(x) * ∑[U_i(t) * φ_i'(x)]] dx + ∫[v(x) * f(x)] dx\n\n7. Choose v(x) = φ_j(x):\n\n∫[φ_j(x) * ∑[U_i'(t) * φ_i(x)]] dx = -k ∫[φ_j'(x) * ∑[U_i(t) * φ_i'(x)]] dx + ∫[φ_j(x) * f(x)] dx\n\n8. Compute the integrals:\n\nM_ij = ∫[φ_j(x) * φ_i(x)] dx\nK_ij = ∫[φ_j'(x) * φ_i'(x)] dx\nF_j = ∫[φ_j(x) * f(x)] dx\n\n9. Assemble the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\nM * U'(t) = -k * K * U(t) + F\n\n10. Apply the initial condition:\n\nU(x, 0) = ∑[U_i(0) * φ_i(x)] = sin(πx)\n\nSolve for U_i(0) using the basis functions.\n\n11. Solve the system of ODEs:\n\nUse a suitable ODE solver (e.g., the backward Euler method or the Crank-Nicolson method) to solve the system of ODEs for U_i(t) in the time range [0, T].\n\n12. Compute the temperature distribution:\n\nOnce the coefficients U_i(t) are obtained, the temperature distribution u(x, t) can be approximated by U(x, t) = ∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)] for each interval."
