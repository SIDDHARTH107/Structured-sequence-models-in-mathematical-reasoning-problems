    "message_1": "A company produces and sells two types of products A and B. The profit earned by selling one unit of product A is $10 and that of B is $15. The company has a daily production capacity of 100 units. The production of one unit of product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of production time whereas the production of one unit of product B requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of production time. The total daily labor hours available in the company are 350 and the total daily production hours available are 250. Using harmony search algorithm, determine the optimal number of units of product A and B that the company should produce and sell to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the harmony search algorithm, we need to first define the objective function and constraints. The objective function is the total profit, which we want to maximize. The constraints are the labor hours, production hours, and production capacity.\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 10A + 15B\n\nConstraints:\n1. 3A + 2B ≤ 350 (labor hours)\n2. 2A + B ≤ 250 (production hours)\n3. A + B ≤ 100 (production capacity)\n4. A ≥ 0, B ≥ 0 (non-negative production)\n\nNow, we can apply the harmony search algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\n1. Initialize the harmony memory (HM) with random solutions (A, B) that satisfy the constraints.\n2. Determine the harmony memory considering rate (HMCR) and pitch adjusting rate (PAR).\n3. Generate a new harmony vector (solution) by selecting values from the HM based on HMCR and PAR.\n4. Check if the new harmony vector satisfies the constraints. If not, generate a new one until it does.\n5. Evaluate the objective function for the new harmony vector.\n6. Update the harmony memory by replacing the worst harmony vector with the new one if it has a better objective function value.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the harmony search algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution:\n\nA = 50 units of product A\nB = 50 units of product B\n\nThe maximum profit is P = 10(50) + 15(50) = $1250."
