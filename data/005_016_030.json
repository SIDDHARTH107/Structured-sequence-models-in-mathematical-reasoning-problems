The company has collected the following data:\n\n- Average age of employees who stayed: 35 years\n- Average salary of employees who stayed: $50,000\n- Average age of employees who left: 28 years\n- Average salary of employees who left: $40,000\n\nUsing discriminant analysis, determine a decision boundary for the company to use in predicting whether an employee will stay or leave, based on their age and salary.",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis and determine a decision boundary, we first need to define the two groups based on the given data:\n\nGroup 1 (Employees who stayed):\n- Mean age (μ1_age) = 35 years\n- Mean salary (μ1_salary) = $50,000\n\nGroup 2 (Employees who left):\n- Mean age (μ2_age) = 28 years\n- Mean salary (μ2_salary) = $40,000\n\nLet's assume that the variances for both age and salary are equal for both groups. We can now calculate the linear discriminant function, which will help us determine the decision boundary.\n\nThe linear discriminant function is given by:\n\nD(x) = W'x + w0\n\nwhere W is the weight vector, x is the input vector (age and salary), and w0 is the bias term.\n\nTo calculate the weight vector W, we use the following formula:\n\nW = Σ^(-1) (μ1 - μ2)\n\nwhere Σ^(-1) is the inverse of the covariance matrix, and μ1 and μ2 are the mean vectors of the two groups.\n\nSince we don't have the covariance matrix, we can't calculate the exact weight vector. However, we can still provide a general form of the decision boundary.\n\nThe decision boundary will be a line in the age-salary plane, where D(x) = 0. This means that:\n\nW'x + w0 = 0\n\nPlugging in the weight vector and input vector, we get:\n\nW_age * age + W_salary * salary + w0 = 0\n\nRearranging the terms, we get the decision boundary equation:\n\nsalary = - (W_age / W_salary) * age - (w0 / W_salary)\n\nThis equation represents the decision boundary that separates employees who are likely to stay from those who are likely to leave, based on their age and salary. To get the exact values of W_age, W_salary, and w0, the company would need to provide the covariance matrix or additional data points for both groups."
