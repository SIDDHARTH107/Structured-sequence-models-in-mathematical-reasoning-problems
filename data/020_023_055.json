The expected returns and standard deviations of each stock are as follows:\n\n| Stock  | Expected Return (%) | Standard Deviation (%) |\n|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| A        | 10                        | 9                                  |\n| B        | 8                          | 12                                |\n| C        | 14                        | 11                                |\n| D        | 9                          | 10                                |\n\nIf you want to minimize the risk (as measured by the portfolio's standard deviation) while achieving an expected return of at least 9%, how should you allocate your investment budget among the four stocks?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation of the investment budget among the four stocks, we can use the concept of portfolio optimization, specifically the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) by Harry Markowitz. The MPT focuses on maximizing the expected return for a given level of risk (standard deviation) or minimizing the risk for a given level of expected return.\n\nLet x_A, x_B, x_C, and x_D be the proportions of the investment budget allocated to stocks A, B, C, and D, respectively. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D = 1 (the sum of the proportions must equal 1)\n2. 10x_A + 8x_B + 14x_C + 9x_D >= 9 (the expected return of the portfolio must be at least 9%)\n\nTo minimize the risk, we need to find the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation. The standard deviation of the portfolio can be calculated as:\n\nσ_p = sqrt(w_A^2 * σ_A^2 + w_B^2 * σ_B^2 + w_C^2 * σ_C^2 + w_D^2 * σ_D^2 + 2 * w_A * w_B * Cov(A, B) + 2 * w_A * w_C * Cov(A, C) + 2 * w_A * w_D * Cov(A, D) + 2 * w_B * w_C * Cov(B, C) + 2 * w_B * w_D * Cov(B, D) + 2 * w_C * w_D * Cov(C, D))\n\nwhere w_i is the weight of each stock in the portfolio and Cov(i, j) is the covariance between stocks i and j.\n\nHowever, without the covariance information between the stocks, we cannot directly calculate the portfolio standard deviation. In this case, we can only provide a general guideline for allocating the investment budget:\n\n1. Allocate more funds to stocks with higher expected returns and lower standard deviations (e.g., Stock A and Stock C).\n2. Allocate less funds to stocks with lower expected returns and higher standard deviations (e.g., Stock B and Stock D).\n\nA more precise allocation would require additional information about the correlations between the stocks."
