    "message_2": "The given lines are not intersecting, but skew lines. To find the shortest distance between these skew lines, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = |(P2 - P1) · N| / ||N||\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are points on the lines L1 and L2, respectively, and N is the cross product of the direction vectors of the lines.\n\nFirst, let's find the direction vectors of the lines:\n\nL1: d1 = (2, -1, 4)\nL2: d2 = (-1, 3, 1)\n\nNow, let's find the cross product N:\n\nN = d1 × d2 = (2, -1, 4) × (-1, 3, 1) = (-7, -6, 7)\n\nNext, let's find the points P1 and P2 on the lines L1 and L2:\n\nP1 = (1, 2, 3)\nP2 = (3, -1, 2)\n\nNow, let's find the vector P2 - P1:\n\nP2 - P1 = (3 - 1, -1 - 2, 2 - 3) = (2, -3, -1)\n\nNow, let's find the dot product (P2 - P1) · N:\n\n(P2 - P1) · N = (2, -3, -1) · (-7, -6, 7) = -14 + 18 - 7 = -3\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of N:\n\n||N|| = √((-7)^2 + (-6)^2 + 7^2) = √(49 + 36 + 49) = √134\n\nFinally, let's find the shortest distance between the skew lines:\n\nDistance = |(-3)| / √134 = 3 / √134 ≈ 0.259\n\nSo, the shortest distance between the given skew lines is approximately 0.259 units."
