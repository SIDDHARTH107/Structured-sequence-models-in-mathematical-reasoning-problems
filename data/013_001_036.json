    "message_1": "Two criminal partners, John and Sarah, have been locked up in separate cells, accused of committing a crime together. The police believe that they have enough evidence to convict them, but they also know that without a confession, they will not be able to secure a conviction for the more serious charge. The police have offered both John and Sarah a deal. If one of them confesses and the other does not, the confessor will receive a shorter sentence than the non-confessor. If both confess or if neither confesses, they will both receive a moderately long sentence. The following matrix shows the possible outcomes and the corresponding sentences. \n\n|                   |Sarah stays silent |Sarah confesses |\n|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n|John stays silent |Both receive 2 years |John: 10 years; Sarah: 1 year|\n|John confesses     |John: 1 year; Sarah: 10 years |Both receive 5 years      |\n\nWhat should John do in this situation if he wants to receive the shortest possible sentence?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, if John wants to receive the shortest possible sentence, he should confess. If he confesses and Sarah stays silent, he will receive a 1-year sentence. If he confesses and Sarah also confesses, he will receive a 5-year sentence. In both cases, confessing results in a shorter sentence for John compared to staying silent and Sarah confessing (10-year sentence)."
