    "message_1": "A juice company can produce two types of juice: apple and mango. Each bottle of apple juice requires 1.5 apples and 0.5 mangoes, while each bottle of mango juice requires 2 apples and 1 mango. The company has 60 apples and 20 mangoes available for production. Each bottle of juice sells for $3.00. What is the maximum profit the company can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of apple juice bottles and y be the number of mango juice bottles.\n\nThe constraints for the number of apples and mangoes are:\n\n1.5x + 2y ≤ 60 (apples constraint)\n0.5x + y ≤ 20 (mangoes constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 3x + 3y, subject to the constraints above.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the profit function to P(x, y) = 3(x + y), since the price per bottle is the same for both types of juice.\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region for the constraints:\n\n1.5x + 2y ≤ 60\n=> y ≤ (60 - 1.5x) / 2\n\n0.5x + y ≤ 20\n=> y ≤ 20 - 0.5x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. We can find these points by solving the constraint equations simultaneously:\n\n1. Intersection of the apple constraint and the mango constraint:\n\n1.5x + 2y = 60\n0.5x + y = 20\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 2, we get:\n\nx + 2y = 40\n\nSubtracting this equation from the first equation, we get:\n\n0.5x = 20\n=> x = 40\n\nSubstituting x back into the second equation:\n\n0.5(40) + y = 20\n=> y = 0\n\nSo, the intersection point is (40, 0).\n\n2. Intersection of the apple constraint with the y-axis (x = 0):\n\n1.5x + 2y = 60\n=> 2y = 60\n=> y = 30\n\n3. Intersection of the mango constraint with the x-axis (y = 0):\n\n0.5x + y = 20\n=> 0.5x = 20\n=> x = 40\n\nNow, we need to check the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 3(0 + 0) = 0\nP(40, 0) = 3(40 + 0) = 120\nP(0, 30) = 3(0 + 30) = 90\n\nHowever, the point (0, 30) is not in the feasible region because it does not satisfy the mango constraint. Therefore, the maximum profit the company can make is $120 by producing 40 bottles of apple juice and no bottles of mango juice."
