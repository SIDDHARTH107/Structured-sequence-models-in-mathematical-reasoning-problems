    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128, which are generated using the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1) where p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers.\n\nThe sixth perfect number is generated when p = 19, as both 19 and (2^19 - 1) = 524287 are prime numbers. Using the formula:\n\n2^(19-1) * (2^19 - 1) = 2^18 * 524287 = 262144 * 524287 = 137438691328\n\nSo, the sixth perfect number is 137,438,691,328."
