    "message_1": "A message has been encrypted using a simple substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet is replaced with another letter. The letter \"e\" appears the most frequently in the original message, with a relative frequency of 12.7%. However, in the encrypted message, the most frequently occurring letter is \"x\", with a relative frequency of 9.5%. What is the most likely substitution for the letter \"e\" in the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "The most likely substitution for the letter \"e\" in the encrypted message is \"x\". Since \"e\" is the most frequently occurring letter in the original message and \"x\" is the most frequently occurring letter in the encrypted message, it is reasonable to assume that \"e\" has been replaced with \"x\" in the substitution cipher."
