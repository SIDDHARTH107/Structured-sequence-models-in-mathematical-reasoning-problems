    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the parametric surface, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start by finding the tangent vectors:\n\nx_u = ∂x/∂u = cos(v)\nx_v = ∂x/∂v = -u sin(v)\n\ny_u = ∂y/∂u = sin(v)\ny_v = ∂y/∂v = u cos(v)\n\nz_u = ∂z/∂u = 2u\nz_v = ∂z/∂v = 0\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <x_u, x_u> = (cos(v))^2 + (sin(v))^2 + (2u)^2 = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <x_u, x_v> = -u cos(v) sin(v) + u sin(v) cos(v) = 0\nG = <x_v, x_v> = (u sin(v))^2 + (u cos(v))^2 = u^2\n\nNext, we need to compute the second derivatives:\n\nx_uu = ∂²x/∂u² = 0\nx_uv = ∂²x/∂u∂v = -sin(v)\nx_vv = ∂²x/∂v² = -u cos(v)\n\ny_uu = ∂²y/∂u² = 0\ny_uv = ∂²y/∂u∂v = cos(v)\ny_vv = ∂²y/∂v² = -u sin(v)\n\nz_uu = ∂²z/∂u² = 2\nz_uv = ∂²z/∂u∂v = 0\nz_vv = ∂²z/∂v² = 0\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <N, x_uu> = 0\nM = <N, x_uv> = -sin(v) * N_x + cos(v) * N_y\nN = <N, x_vv> = -u cos(v) * N_x - u sin(v) * N_y\n\nTo find the normal vector N, we take the cross product of the tangent vectors:\n\nN = x_u × x_v = (cos(v), sin(v), 2u) × (-u sin(v), u cos(v), 0) = (2u^2 cos(v), 2u^2 sin(v), u)\n\nNow, let's compute M and N:\n\nM = -sin(v) * (2u^2 cos(v)) + cos(v) * (2u^2 sin(v)) = 0\nN = -u cos(v) * (2u^2 cos(v)) - u sin(v) * (2u^2 sin(v)) = -2u^3\n\nFinally, we can compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (E * N - 2F * M + G * L) / (2(EG - F^2)) = (-2u^3) / (2(4u^4 - 0)) = -u^3 / (8u^4) = -1 / (8u)\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature at the point where u = 2 and v = π/3:\n\nH(2, π/3) = -1 / (8 * 2) = -1 / 16\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (2, π/3) is -1/16."
