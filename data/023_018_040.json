    "message_2": "To find the step response of the control system, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the step input function, which is u(t) = 1 for t > 0. The Laplace transform of u(t) is U(s) = 1/s.\n\nNow, we need to find the Laplace transform of the output function Y(s) by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input function U(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * U(s) = [(s + 1) / (s^2 + 4s + 3)] * (1/s)\n\nY(s) = (s + 1) / [s * (s^2 + 4s + 3)]\n\nNext, we need to perform a partial fraction decomposition on Y(s) to make it easier to find the inverse Laplace transform:\n\nY(s) = A/s + B/(s + 1) + C/(s + 3)\n\nTo find the coefficients A, B, and C, we can clear the denominators:\n\ns + 1 = A(s + 1)(s + 3) + B(s)(s + 3) + C(s)(s + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A, B, and C by substituting appropriate values of s:\n\nFor s = 0:\n1 = 3A => A = 1/3\n\nFor s = -1:\n0 = -2A + B(-1) => B = 2/3\n\nFor s = -3:\n4 = 6C => C = 2/3\n\nNow we have:\n\nY(s) = (1/3) / s + (2/3) / (s + 1) + (2/3) / (s + 3)\n\nTo find the step response y(t), we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1)[Y(s)] = (1/3)L^(-1)[1/s] + (2/3)L^(-1)[1/(s + 1)] + (2/3)L^(-1)[1/(s + 3)]\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform properties and tables, we get:\n\ny(t) = (1/3)u(t) + (2/3)e^(-t)u(t) + (2/3)e^(-3t)u(t)\n\nThis is the step response of the control system for t > 0."
