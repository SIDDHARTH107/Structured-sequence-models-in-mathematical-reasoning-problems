    "message_1": "Suppose a company manufactures light bulbs that have an average lifespan of 3000 hours with a standard deviation of 200 hours. If a customer buys a pack of 25 bulbs, find the probability that the average lifespan of the bulbs in the pack is less than 2900 hours using Bayesian statistics with a prior distribution of Beta (1,1).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we will first find the posterior distribution of the average lifespan of the bulbs, given the prior distribution of Beta(1,1). Then, we will find the probability that the average lifespan of the bulbs in the pack is less than 2900 hours.\n\n1. Prior distribution: Beta(1,1)\nThe prior distribution is given as Beta(1,1), which is a uniform distribution on the interval [0, ∞). This means that we have no prior knowledge about the average lifespan of the bulbs, and all values are equally likely.\n\n2. Likelihood function:\nThe likelihood function represents the probability of observing the data (the lifespans of the bulbs) given the parameter (the average lifespan). In this case, the lifespans of the bulbs are normally distributed with a mean of 3000 hours and a standard deviation of 200 hours.\n\nThe likelihood function for a normal distribution is given by:\n\nL(μ, σ²) = (1 / (2πσ²)^(n/2)) * exp(-Σ(x_i - μ)² / (2σ²))\n\nwhere μ is the mean, σ² is the variance, n is the number of data points (25 in this case), and x_i are the data points (the lifespans of the bulbs).\n\n3. Posterior distribution:\nThe posterior distribution is the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function, normalized by the marginal likelihood (the probability of the data).\n\nIn this case, the prior distribution is a uniform distribution, so the posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood function. Since we are only interested in the probability that the average lifespan is less than 2900 hours, we do not need to compute the normalization constant.\n\n4. Probability that the average lifespan is less than 2900 hours:\nTo find the probability that the average lifespan of the bulbs in the pack is less than 2900 hours, we need to integrate the posterior distribution from 0 to 2900.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a normal distribution, we can use the z-score to find the probability. The z-score is given by:\n\nz = (x - μ) / (σ / sqrt(n))\n\nwhere x is the value we are interested in (2900 hours), μ is the mean (3000 hours), σ is the standard deviation (200 hours), and n is the number of bulbs (25).\n\nz = (2900 - 3000) / (200 / sqrt(25)) = -100 / (200 / 5) = -100 / 40 = -2.5\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.5. The probability is approximately 0.0062.\n\nSo, the probability that the average lifespan of the bulbs in the pack is less than 2900 hours is approximately 0.0062 or 0.62%."
