    "message_1": "A textbook publisher has a fixed cost of $10,000 to produce a new math textbook. The publisher will print and sell each copy for $50. The demand function for the textbook is given by: \nD(p) = 5000 - 100p, \nwhere p is the price per textbook and D(p) is the number of textbooks the publisher expects to sell at that price. \nWhat should be the optimal price to maximize the publisher's profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize the publisher's profit, we first need to find the revenue function, which is the product of the price per textbook and the number of textbooks sold. \n\nRevenue (R) = price (p) × demand (D(p))\n\nR(p) = p × (5000 - 100p)\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function, which is the revenue minus the fixed cost:\n\nProfit (P) = Revenue (R) - Fixed cost\n\nP(p) = R(p) - 10000\n\nP(p) = p × (5000 - 100p) - 10000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to the price (p) and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndP(p)/dp = 0\n\ndP(p)/dp = (5000 - 100p) - p × (-100)\n\ndP(p)/dp = 5000 - 200p\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for p:\n\n0 = 5000 - 200p\n\n200p = 5000\n\np = 5000 / 200\n\np = 25\n\nSo, the optimal price to maximize the publisher's profit is $25 per textbook."
