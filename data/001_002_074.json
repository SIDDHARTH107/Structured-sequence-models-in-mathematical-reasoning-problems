    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept of a line, we need to determine the point where the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-coordinate is 0. So, we can set y to 0 in the given equation and solve for x.\n\n0 = 2x - 6\n\nNow, add 6 to both sides of the equation:\n\n6 = 2x\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2:\n\n3 = x\n\nSo, the x-intercept of the line represented by the equation y = 2x - 6 is x = 3, or the point (3, 0)."
