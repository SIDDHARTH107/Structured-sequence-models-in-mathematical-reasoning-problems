    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |x| on the interval [-π, π], we first need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function, all the b_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the a_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nFor an even function, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients a_n:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor f(x) = |x|, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] |x| dx\n\nSince |x| is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] x dx = (2/π) * [x^2/2] evaluated from 0 to π = π\n\nSo, a_0 = π.\n\nNow, let's compute a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] |x| * cos(n * x) dx\n\nAgain, since |x| is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] x * cos(n * x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(uv) evaluated from 0 to π - ∫[0, π] v du]\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(x * (1/n) * sin(n * x)) evaluated from 0 to π - ∫[0, π] (1/n) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\na_n = (2/π) * [0 - (1/n^2) * (cos(n * x)) evaluated from 0 to π]\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n^2) * (cos(n * π) - 1)]\n\nFor n even, cos(n * π) = 1, and for n odd, cos(n * π) = -1. So, we can rewrite a_n as:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n^2) * (1 - 1)] for n even\na_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n^2) * (-1 - 1)] for n odd\n\na_n = 0 for n even\na_n = (4/π) * (1/n^2) for n odd\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = |x| on the interval [-π, π]:\n\nf(x) = π/2 + Σ[(4/π) * (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)] for n odd"
