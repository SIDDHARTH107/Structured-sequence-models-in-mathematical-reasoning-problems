    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 5x + 7y = 53, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution and then use the general solution formula for Diophantine equations.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 5 and 7 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n7 = 1 * 5 + 2\n5 = 2 * 2 + 1\n2 = 2 * 1\n\nThe gcd(5, 7) = 1.\n\nNow, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers x and y such that:\n\n5x + 7y = gcd(5, 7) = 1\n\nWorking backwards from the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1 = 5 - 2 * 2\n1 = 5 - 2 * (7 - 1 * 5)\n1 = 5 - 2 * 7 + 2 * 5\n1 = 3 * 5 - 2 * 7\n\nSo, we have a particular solution x = 3 and y = -2.\n\nNow, we use the general solution formula for Diophantine equations:\n\nx = x0 + (b/gcd(a, b)) * t\ny = y0 - (a/gcd(a, b)) * t\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions we found (3, -2), a and b are the coefficients of x and y (5 and 7), gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b (1), and t is an integer.\n\nx = 3 + (7/1) * t = 3 + 7t\ny = -2 - (5/1) * t = -2 - 5t\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 5x + 7y = 53 by plugging in different integer values for t:\n\nFor t = 0:\nx = 3 + 7 * 0 = 3\ny = -2 - 5 * 0 = -2\n(3, -2) is a solution.\n\nFor t = 1:\nx = 3 + 7 * 1 = 10\ny = -2 - 5 * 1 = -7\n(10, -7) is a solution.\n\nFor t = -1:\nx = 3 + 7 * (-1) = -4\ny = -2 - 5 * (-1) = 3\n(-4, 3) is a solution.\n\nWe can continue to find more integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for t. The general solution is given by:\n\nx = 3 + 7t\ny = -2 - 5t\n\nwhere t is an integer."
