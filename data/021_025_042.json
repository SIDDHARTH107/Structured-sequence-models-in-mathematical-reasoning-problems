    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, for this cubic function, we can find the maximum point using calculus, which is more straightforward and accurate.\n\nTo find the maximum point of the function f(x) = -x^3 + 6x^2 - 3x + 7, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the first derivative of the function with respect to x:\nf'(x) = -3x^2 + 12x - 3\n\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x to find the critical points:\n-3x^2 + 12x - 3 = 0\n\n3. Factor the equation:\n3(-x^2 + 4x - 1) = 0\n\n4. Use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\nx = ( -b ± √(b^2 - 4ac) ) / 2a\nx = ( -4 ± √(4^2 - 4(-1)) ) / 2(-1)\n\n5. Calculate the two possible x values:\nx1 = ( -4 + √(20) ) / -2 ≈ 0.276393\nx2 = ( -4 - √(20) ) / -2 ≈ 1.72361\n\n6. Determine which of these x values corresponds to a maximum point by evaluating the second derivative of the function:\nf''(x) = -6x + 12\n\n7. Evaluate the second derivative at x1 and x2:\nf''(0.276393) ≈ 9.54136 > 0, which indicates a minimum point\nf''(1.72361) ≈ -2.54136 < 0, which indicates a maximum point\n\n8. The maximum point occurs at x = 1.72361. Now, find the corresponding y value by plugging this x value into the original function:\nf(1.72361) ≈ -1.72361^3 + 6(1.72361)^2 - 3(1.72361) + 7 ≈ 9.38154\n\n9. Therefore, the maximum point of the function f(x) = -x^3 + 6x^2 - 3x + 7 is approximately (1.72361, 9.38154).\n\nNote that the Whale Optimization Algorithm could be used to solve this problem, but it would be less efficient and less accurate than using calculus for this specific function."
