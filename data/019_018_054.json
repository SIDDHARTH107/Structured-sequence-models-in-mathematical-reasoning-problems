    "message_2": "To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always an even number using proof theory, we will use the definition of even numbers and basic properties of arithmetic.\n\nDefinition: An even number is an integer that can be written in the form 2n, where n is an integer.\n\nLet a and b be two even numbers. By definition, we can write:\n\na = 2n\nb = 2m\n\nwhere n and m are integers.\n\nNow, we want to show that the sum of a and b is also an even number. So, we compute the sum:\n\na + b = (2n) + (2m)\n\nUsing the distributive property of arithmetic, we can factor out the 2:\n\na + b = 2(n + m)\n\nSince n and m are integers, their sum (n + m) is also an integer. Let's denote this integer as k:\n\nk = n + m\n\nNow, we can rewrite the sum of a and b as:\n\na + b = 2k\n\nwhere k is an integer.\n\nBy the definition of even numbers, this shows that the sum of two even numbers (a and b) is also an even number. Thus, we have proven that the sum of two even numbers is always an even number using proof theory."
