    "message_1": "A thin sheet of aluminum, 0.5 mm thick, is subjected to a tensile stress of 150 MPa. Determine the maximum value of the shear stress induced in the sheet, assuming that the metal exhibits isotropic behavior. Use Fourier transform techniques to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum value of the shear stress induced in the sheet, we can use the plane stress transformation equations. Since the aluminum sheet exhibits isotropic behavior, we can assume that the stress state is plane stress. The plane stress transformation equations are given by:\n\nσx' = (σx + σy)/2 + (σx - σy)/2 * cos(2θ) + τxy * sin(2θ)\nτx'y' = -(σx - σy)/2 * sin(2θ) + τxy * cos(2θ)\n\nwhere σx and σy are the normal stresses in the x and y directions, τxy is the shear stress, θ is the angle of rotation, and σx', σy', and τx'y' are the transformed stresses.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the tensile stress σx = 150 MPa, and since there is no mention of any stress in the y direction, we can assume σy = 0. Also, there is no initial shear stress mentioned, so we can assume τxy = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum shear stress (τx'y') by differentiating the second equation with respect to θ and setting the result equal to zero:\n\nd(τx'y')/dθ = -(σx - σy)/2 * cos(2θ) - τxy * sin(2θ) = 0\n\nSince τxy = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\ncos(2θ) = 0\n\nThis occurs when 2θ = π/2 or 3π/2. Therefore, the angle θ = π/4 or 3π/4.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of σx, σy, τxy, and θ into the second plane stress transformation equation to find the maximum shear stress:\n\nτx'y' = -(150 MPa - 0)/2 * sin(2 * π/4) + 0 * cos(2 * π/4)\nτx'y' = -75 MPa * sin(π/2)\nτx'y' = -75 MPa\n\nThe maximum shear stress induced in the sheet is 75 MPa. Note that the negative sign indicates the direction of the shear stress, but the magnitude of the maximum shear stress is 75 MPa."
