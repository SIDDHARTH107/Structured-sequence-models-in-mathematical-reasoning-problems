    "message_2": "To show that the Hodge numbers h11 and h21 vanish for the Calabi-Yau variety X defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0, we will use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the fact that Calabi-Yau varieties have trivial canonical bundle.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for Hodge numbers. Let Y be a smooth projective variety of dimension n, and let X be a smooth hyperplane section of Y. Then, for 0 < k < n - 1, we have:\n\nh^{k,0}(X) = h^{k,0}(Y) and h^{0,k}(X) = h^{0,k}(Y)\n\nNow, consider the projective space P^4 with homogeneous coordinates [x:y:z:w:t]. We can embed our Calabi-Yau variety X in P^4 by considering the equation:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = t^3\n\nLet Y be the Fermat cubic threefold in P^4 defined by the equation:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 + t^3 = 0\n\nThe Calabi-Yau variety X is a hyperplane section of Y given by t = 1. Since Y is a smooth cubic threefold, it has h11(Y) = 0 and h21(Y) = 1.\n\nNow, we apply the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to the pair (Y, X). Since X is a Calabi-Yau variety, it has a trivial canonical bundle, which implies that h21(X) = h20(X) - 1. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have:\n\nh21(X) = h21(Y) = 1\n\nHowever, we just concluded that h21(X) = h20(X) - 1. Therefore, h20(X) = 2. Since X is a Calabi-Yau variety, it has a trivial canonical bundle, which implies that h11(X) = h20(X) - 1. Thus, we have:\n\nh11(X) = h20(X) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, we have shown that h11(X) = 1 and h21(X) = 1, which means that they do not vanish for the Calabi-Yau variety X defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0."
