You have a budget of $20,000 for maintenance and repairs for the next six months. The costs of maintaining each vehicle for each month are as follows:\n\nVehicle 1: $1,000, $1,100, $1,200, $1,300, $1,400, $1,500\n\nVehicle 2: $900, $950, $1,000, $1,050, $1,100, $1,150\n\nVehicle 3: $800, $850, $900, $950, $1,000, $1,050\n\nVehicle 4: $700, $750, $800, $850, $900, $950\n\nVehicle 5: $600, $650, $700, $750, $800, $850\n\nVehicle 6: $500, $550, $600, $650, $700, $750\n\nVehicle 7: $400, $450, $500, $550, $600, $650\n\nVehicle 8: $300, $350, $400, $450, $500, $550\n\nVehicle 9: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450\n\nVehicle 10: $100, $150, $200, $250, $300, $350\n\nUse the firefly algorithm to determine the optimal distribution of the budget for each vehicle in order to minimize the total cost of maintenance and repairs.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of fireflies. It is a metaheuristic approach used to solve complex optimization problems. However, it is not feasible to perform the firefly algorithm in this text-based environment. Instead, we can solve this problem using a more straightforward approach.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of maintenance for each vehicle over the six months:\n\nVehicle 1: $1,000 + $1,100 + $1,200 + $1,300 + $1,400 + $1,500 = $7,500\nVehicle 2: $900 + $950 + $1,000 + $1,050 + $1,100 + $1,150 = $6,150\nVehicle 3: $800 + $850 + $900 + $950 + $1,000 + $1,050 = $5,550\nVehicle 4: $700 + $750 + $800 + $850 + $900 + $950 = $4,950\nVehicle 5: $600 + $650 + $700 + $750 + $800 + $850 = $4,350\nVehicle 6: $500 + $550 + $600 + $650 + $700 + $750 = $3,750\nVehicle 7: $400 + $450 + $500 + $550 + $600 + $650 = $3,150\nVehicle 8: $300 + $350 + $400 + $450 + $500 + $550 = $2,550\nVehicle 9: $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 + $400 + $450 = $1,950\nVehicle 10: $100 + $150 + $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1,350\n\nNow, let's sort the vehicles by their total cost in ascending order:\n\nVehicle 10: $1,350\nVehicle 9: $1,950\nVehicle 8: $2,550\nVehicle 7: $3,150\nVehicle 6: $3,750\nVehicle 5: $4,350\nVehicle 4: $4,950\nVehicle 3: $5,550\nVehicle 2: $6,150\nVehicle 1: $7,500\n\nSince we have a budget of $20,000, we should prioritize the vehicles with the lowest total cost. We will allocate the budget to the vehicles in the sorted order until the budget is exhausted.\n\nVehicle 10: $1,350 (Remaining budget: $20,000 - $1,350 = $18,650)\nVehicle 9: $1,950 (Remaining budget: $18,650 - $1,950 = $16,700)\nVehicle 8: $2,550 (Remaining budget: $16,700 - $2,550 = $14,150)\nVehicle 7: $3,150 (Remaining budget: $14,150 - $3,150 = $11,000)\nVehicle 6: $3,750 (Remaining budget: $11,000 - $3,750 = $7,250)\nVehicle 5: $4,350 (Remaining budget: $7,250 - $4,350 = $2,900)\n\nAt this point, we can't afford to maintain Vehicle 4, so we will distribute the remaining budget of $2,900 among the first five vehicles. We can do this by allocating the remaining budget proportionally to the total cost of each vehicle:\n\nVehicle 10: $1,350 + ($2,900 * $1,350 / $13,800) = $1,350 + $350 = $1,700\nVehicle 9: $1,950 + ($2,900 * $1,950 / $13,800) = $1,950 + $650 = $2,600\nVehicle 8: $2,550 + ($2,900 * $2,550 / $13,800) = $2,550 + $950 = $3,500\nVehicle 7: $3,150 + ($2,900 * $3,150 / $13,800) = $3,150 + $1,250 = $4,400\nVehicle 6: $3,750 + ($2,900 * $3,750 / $13,800) = $3,750 + $1,700 = $5,450\n\nThe optimal distribution of the budget for each vehicle is as follows:\n\nVehicle 1: $0\nVehicle 2: $0\nVehicle 3: $0\nVehicle 4: $0\nVehicle 5: $5,450\nVehicle 6: $4,400\nVehicle 7: $3,500\nVehicle 8: $2,600\nVehicle 9: $1,700\nVehicle 10: $1,350"
