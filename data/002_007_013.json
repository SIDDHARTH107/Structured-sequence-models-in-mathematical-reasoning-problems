    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 6 cm, one base is 8 cm and the other base is 12 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 6 cm, one base is 8 cm, and the other base is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (8 + 12) * 6\n\nArea = (1/2) * 20 * 6\n\nArea = 10 * 6\n\nArea = 60 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 60 square centimeters."
