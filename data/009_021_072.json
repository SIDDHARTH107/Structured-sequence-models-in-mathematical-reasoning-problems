    "message_1": "Consider the following Partial Differential Equation: \n\n∂u/∂t = 2 ∂²u/∂x² - 3u\n\nwhere u(x, t) is a function of two variables. If the initial condition is given by u(x,0) = x², and the boundary conditions are given by u(0,t) = e^(2t) and u(1,t) = e^(3t), find the solution u(x, t) at x = 0.5 and t = 0.5.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 2X''(x)T(t) - 3X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2X(x)T(t) to separate the variables:\n\nT'(t) / (2T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x) - 3/2\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / (2T(t)) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) - 3/2 = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) T'(t) = -2λT(t)\n2) X''(x) - (3 + 2λ)X(x) = 0\n\nWe first solve the ODE for X(x):\n\nX''(x) - (3 + 2λ)X(x) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A * e^(√(3 + 2λ) * x) + B * e^(-√(3 + 2λ) * x)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, t) = X(0)T(t) = e^(2t) => X(0) = 1\nu(1, t) = X(1)T(t) = e^(3t) => X(1) = e\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, we get:\n\n1 = A * e^(0) + B * e^(0) => A + B = 1\n\nFrom the second boundary condition, we get:\n\ne = A * e^(√(3 + 2λ)) + B * e^(-√(3 + 2λ))\n\nNow, we have two equations and two unknowns (A and B). However, we also have the unknown λ. To find λ, we can use the initial condition:\n\nu(x, 0) = X(x)T(0) = x² => X(x) = x² / T(0)\n\nSince T(0) is a constant, we can absorb it into A and B. Thus, we have:\n\nx² = A * e^(√(3 + 2λ) * x) + B * e^(-√(3 + 2λ) * x)\n\nThis is an equation that relates x, A, B, and λ. Unfortunately, this equation is not easy to solve analytically. However, we can find an approximate solution using numerical methods.\n\nOnce we have the values for A, B, and λ, we can find the solution for X(x). Then, we can solve the ODE for T(t):\n\nT'(t) = -2λT(t)\n\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE, and its general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C * e^(-2λt)\n\nFinally, the solution for u(x, t) is:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t) = (A * e^(√(3 + 2λ) * x) + B * e^(-√(3 + 2λ) * x)) * (C * e^(-2λt))\n\nTo find the solution u(x, t) at x = 0.5 and t = 0.5, we can plug in these values into the expression for u(x, t) after finding the values for A, B, λ, and C using the initial and boundary conditions and numerical methods."
