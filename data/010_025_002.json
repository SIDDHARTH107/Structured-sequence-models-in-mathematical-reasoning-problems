    "message_2": "In a topological quantum field theory, we can use the Euler characteristic formula to determine the Euler characteristic of a genus-2 surface. The Euler characteristic (χ) is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a genus-2 surface, we can think of it as a surface formed by gluing two tori (donut-shaped surfaces) together. A torus has one face, no vertices, and no edges. When we glue two tori together, we still have no vertices and no edges, but we now have two faces.\n\nSo, for a genus-2 surface, we have:\n\nV = 0\nE = 0\nF = 2\n\nPlugging these values into the Euler characteristic formula, we get:\n\nχ = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of a genus-2 surface is 2."
