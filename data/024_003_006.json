    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature (K) of a surface is given by the formula:\n\nK = (k1 * k2)\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are the principal curvatures of the surface.\n\nFor a cylinder, one of the principal curvatures (k1) is zero, as there is no curvature along the length of the cylinder (the height direction). The other principal curvature (k2) is the reciprocal of the radius of the cylinder.\n\nSo, k1 = 0 and k2 = 1/r, where r is the radius of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 3 cm. Therefore, k2 = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature (K):\n\nK = (k1 * k2) = (0 * 1/3) = 0\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at any point on the cylinder is 0."
