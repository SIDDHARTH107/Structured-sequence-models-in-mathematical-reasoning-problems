    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we'll first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 |  7 ]\n[ 3  4 -2 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -5 ]\n[ 0  1 -5 | -18 ]\n```\n\n2. Multiply the second row by -1/3, and add 4 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 | 5/3 ]\n[ 0  0 -16/3 | -56/3 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the matrix. Next, we'll perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. Divide the third row by -16/3:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 | 5/3 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 7/4 ]\n```\n\n2. Add 1/3 times the third row to the second row, and subtract the third row from the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  0 | 17/4 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 3/2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 7/4 ]\n```\n\n3. Subtract the second row from the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 | 5/4 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 3/2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 7/4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in its reduced row-echelon form, and we can read off the solutions:\n\nx = 5/4\ny = 3/2\nz = 7/4"
