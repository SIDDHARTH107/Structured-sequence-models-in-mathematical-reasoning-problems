    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of intersection points between two algebraic curves, we can use Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the maximum number of intersection points between two algebraic curves of degrees m and n is equal to the product of their degrees, i.e., m * n, assuming that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are counted with their multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, f(x,y) is of degree 3 and g(x,y) is of degree 2. Therefore, the maximum number of intersection points between the two curves is:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nSo, the maximum number of intersection points between the two algebraic curves is 6."
