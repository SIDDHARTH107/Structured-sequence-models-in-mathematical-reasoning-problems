    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the two non-parallel sides. We can do this by dividing the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side.\n\nLet's call the length of one non-parallel side \"a\" and the other non-parallel side \"b\". The two right triangles formed have heights of 8 cm each. The base of one triangle is the difference between the two parallel sides divided by 2, which is (10 - 6) / 2 = 2 cm. The base of the other triangle is the sum of this value and the shorter parallel side, which is 2 + 6 = 8 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the non-parallel sides:\n\nFor the triangle with base 2 cm:\na^2 = 8^2 + 2^2\na^2 = 64 + 4\na^2 = 68\na = √68\n\nFor the triangle with base 8 cm:\nb^2 = 8^2 + 8^2\nb^2 = 64 + 64\nb^2 = 128\nb = √128\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 6 + 10 + √68 + √128\nPerimeter ≈ 16 + 8.246 + 11.314\nPerimeter ≈ 35.56 cm"
