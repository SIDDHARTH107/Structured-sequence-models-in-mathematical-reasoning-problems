    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph with 9 vertices in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the structure of the graph and the maximum degree of its vertices. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its vertices in this manner.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph (every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices, which is 9. However, if the graph is not complete, the chromatic number could be lower.\n\nFor example, if the graph is a cycle with 9 vertices, the chromatic number is 3 (since it is an odd cycle). If the graph is a tree, the chromatic number is at most 2.\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact minimum number of colors needed. However, we can say that the minimum number of colors needed will be between 2 and 9, inclusive."
