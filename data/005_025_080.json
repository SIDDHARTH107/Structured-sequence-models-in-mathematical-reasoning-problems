    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a sum of 9 or more using two fair six-sided dice, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes (outcomes with a sum of 9 or more).\n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes (sum of 9 or more):\n\n- For a sum of 9: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3) -> 4 outcomes\n- For a sum of 10: (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4) -> 3 outcomes\n- For a sum of 11: (5, 6), (6, 5) -> 2 outcomes\n- For a sum of 12: (6, 6) -> 1 outcome\n\nIn total, there are 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling a sum of 9 or more is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n\nP(sum of 9 or more) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 10 / 36 = 5 / 18 â‰ˆ 0.2778\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 9 or more using two fair six-sided dice is approximately 0.2778 or 27.78%."
