    "message_2": "To determine if G is a connected graph, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 7, so a connected graph must have at least 7-1 = 6 edges.\n\nSince G has 10 edges, which is greater than the minimum required number of edges (6), it is possible for G to be a connected graph. However, this does not guarantee that G is connected.\n\nTo be sure, we can use the maximum number of edges in a disconnected graph. A disconnected graph with n vertices can have at most (n-1)(n-2)/2 edges. In this case, n = 7, so a disconnected graph can have at most (7-1)(7-2)/2 = 15 edges.\n\nSince G has 10 edges, which is less than the maximum number of edges for a disconnected graph (15), it is also possible for G to be a disconnected graph.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine if G is a connected graph or not."
