    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if y is a function of u and u is a function of x, then the derivative of y with respect to x is the product of the derivative of y with respect to u and the derivative of u with respect to x.\n\nLet u = 2t^2 + 3t. Then, x = u and y = sin(u).\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of x with respect to t:\ndx/dt = d(2t^2 + 3t)/dt = 4t + 3.\n\nNext, we find the derivative of y with respect to u:\ndy/du = d(sin(u))/du = cos(u).\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of y with respect to x using the chain rule:\ndy/dx = (dy/du) * (du/dx) = (dy/du) * (dx/dt) * (dt/dx).\n\nWe already have dy/du and dx/dt, so we just need to find dt/dx. To do this, we can take the reciprocal of dx/dt:\ndt/dx = 1/(dx/dt) = 1/(4t + 3).\n\nNow, we can substitute u back in terms of t:\ndy/dx = cos(2t^2 + 3t) * (1/(4t + 3)).\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x is:\ndy/dx = cos(2t^2 + 3t) / (4t + 3)."
