    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. A requires 4 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor time, while B requires 3 hours of machine time and 1 hour of labor time. Each machine is available for 100 hours per week and there are 80 man-hours available per week. The profit per unit for A is $300 and for B is $200. How many units of each product should the company produce in a week to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and labor time can be represented as linear inequalities:\n\nMachine time: 4x + 3y ≤ 100\nLabor time: 2x + y ≤ 80\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 300x + 200y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then find the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the inequalities as equations to find the boundary lines:\n\nMachine time: 4x + 3y = 100\nLabor time: 2x + y = 80\n\nNow, we will find the intercepts for each equation:\n\nMachine time:\nx-intercept: (4x = 100) => x = 25, y = 0 => (25, 0)\ny-intercept: (3y = 100) => y = 100/3, x = 0 => (0, 100/3)\n\nLabor time:\nx-intercept: (2x = 80) => x = 40, y = 0 => (40, 0)\ny-intercept: (y = 80) => y = 80, x = 0 => (0, 80)\n\nNow, we will graph the boundary lines and find the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (25, 0), (40, 0), and (20, 60).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n(0, 0): Profit = 300(0) + 200(0) = $0\n(25, 0): Profit = 300(25) + 200(0) = $7500\n(40, 0): Profit = 300(40) + 200(0) = $12000\n(20, 60): Profit = 300(20) + 200(60) = $6000 + $12000 = $18000\n\nThe maximum profit is $18,000, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of product A and 60 units of product B."
