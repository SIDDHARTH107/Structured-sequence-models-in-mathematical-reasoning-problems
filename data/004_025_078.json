    "message_1": "A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of 20 m/s at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizontal. Determine the maximum height the projectile reaches and the total time the projectile is in the air before hitting the ground. Assume the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s^2.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to break down the initial velocity into its horizontal and vertical components. Since the angle is 45 degrees, we can use the following equations:\n\nVx = V * cos(θ)\nVy = V * sin(θ)\n\nwhere Vx is the horizontal component, Vy is the vertical component, V is the initial velocity (20 m/s), and θ is the angle (45 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n45 degrees * (π/180) = 0.7854 radians\n\nNow we can find the horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity:\n\nVx = 20 * cos(0.7854) ≈ 14.14 m/s\nVy = 20 * sin(0.7854) ≈ 14.14 m/s\n\nNow we can find the maximum height the projectile reaches. We can use the following equation for the vertical motion:\n\nVy^2 = Viy^2 + 2 * a * Δy\n\nwhere Vy is the final vertical velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height), Viy is the initial vertical velocity (14.14 m/s), a is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s^2), and Δy is the change in height (the maximum height).\n\n0 = (14.14)^2 + 2 * (-9.8) * Δy\n\nSolving for Δy:\n\nΔy = (14.14)^2 / (2 * 9.8) ≈ 10.1 m\n\nThe maximum height the projectile reaches is approximately 10.1 meters.\n\nNext, we need to find the total time the projectile is in the air. We can use the following equation for the vertical motion:\n\nΔy = Viy * t + 0.5 * a * t^2\n\nSince the projectile will reach the ground at the same height it was launched from, the total change in height (Δy) will be 0. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n0 = 14.14 * t + 0.5 * (-9.8) * t^2\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n4.9 * t^2 - 14.14 * t = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for t by factoring:\n\nt * (4.9 * t - 14.14) = 0\n\nThe two possible solutions for t are:\n\nt = 0 (the initial time)\nt = 14.14 / 4.9 ≈ 2.88 s\n\nThe total time the projectile is in the air before hitting the ground is approximately 2.88 seconds."
