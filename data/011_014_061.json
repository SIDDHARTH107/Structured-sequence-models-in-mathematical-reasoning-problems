    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the structure of the graph. Since the graph is simple and undirected, we can have different structures for the graph. However, we are only interested in those structures that allow us to color the vertices with the given condition (no two adjacent vertices have the same color).\n\nFor a graph with 5 vertices to be 2-colorable (i.e., can be colored with 2 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color), it must be a bipartite graph. A bipartite graph can be divided into two sets of vertices, where all edges connect vertices from one set to the other set, and there are no edges within the sets.\n\nThere are two possible bipartite structures for a graph with 5 vertices:\n\n1. A complete bipartite graph with partition sets of sizes 2 and 3 (denoted as K(2,3)). In this case, there are 2 ways to color the graph: either color the set with 2 vertices red and the set with 3 vertices blue, or vice versa.\n\n2. A tree structure, where the graph is connected and has no cycles. In this case, we can always color the graph with 2 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. To see this, start by coloring an arbitrary vertex red. Then, color all its neighbors blue. Continue this process, alternating colors as you move through the graph. Since the graph is a tree, you will never encounter a cycle, and this coloring process will always work.\n\nThere are 3 different tree structures for a graph with 5 vertices:\n\n  a. A star graph (one central vertex connected to the other 4 vertices). There are 2 ways to color this graph: either color the central vertex red and the other vertices blue, or vice versa.\n  \n  b. A chain of 4 vertices connected in a line, with the 5th vertex connected to one of the middle vertices. There are 2 ways to color this graph: either color the end vertices red and the other vertices blue, or vice versa.\n  \n  c. A chain of 5 vertices connected in a line. There are 2 ways to color this graph: either color the end vertices red and the other vertices blue, or vice versa.\n\nIn total, there are 2 (K(2,3)) + 2 (star) + 2 (chain with 5th vertex connected to a middle vertex) + 2 (chain of 5 vertices) = 8 different ways to color the vertices of the graph with 2 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color."
