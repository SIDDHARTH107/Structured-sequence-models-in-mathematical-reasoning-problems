    "message_1": "Suppose that a tutoring program advertises that it can increase test scores by at least 10%. Using causal logic, design an experiment to test the effectiveness of the program. How many students should be included in the experiment to produce conclusive results, assuming a significance level of 0.05 and a statistical power of 0.80?",
    "message_2": "To test the effectiveness of the tutoring program, we can design a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Here's a step-by-step outline of the experiment:\n\n1. Randomly select a large sample of students who are willing to participate in the experiment. The sample should be representative of the population of students for whom the tutoring program is intended.\n\n2. Randomly assign the selected students into two groups: the treatment group and the control group. The treatment group will receive the tutoring program, while the control group will not.\n\n3. Measure the test scores of all students in both groups before the tutoring program begins (pre-test scores).\n\n4. Provide the tutoring program to the treatment group for a specified period.\n\n5. After the tutoring program is completed, measure the test scores of all students in both groups again (post-test scores).\n\n6. Calculate the average test score increase for both the treatment and control groups.\n\n7. Perform a hypothesis test to determine if the difference in average test score increases between the treatment and control groups is statistically significant at a 0.05 significance level.\n\nTo determine the required sample size for the experiment, we need to consider the desired statistical power (0.80) and the effect size (10% increase in test scores). We can use the formula for sample size calculation in a two-sample t-test:\n\nn = (Zα/2 + Zβ)^2 * (σ1^2 + σ2^2) / (μ1 - μ2)^2\n\nwhere n is the sample size per group, Zα/2 is the critical value for a two-tailed test at a 0.05 significance level (1.96), Zβ is the critical value for a power of 0.80 (0.84), σ1 and σ2 are the standard deviations of the test score increases in the treatment and control groups, and μ1 and μ2 are the mean test score increases in the treatment and control groups.\n\nAssuming that the tutoring program is effective, we expect a 10% increase in test scores for the treatment group (μ1) and no increase for the control group (μ2). We also need to estimate the standard deviations of the test score increases in both groups (σ1 and σ2). This information might be available from previous studies or pilot tests of the tutoring program.\n\nOnce we have estimates for σ1 and σ2, we can plug the values into the formula and calculate the required sample size per group. Note that the total sample size for the experiment will be twice the calculated value since we have two groups (treatment and control)."
