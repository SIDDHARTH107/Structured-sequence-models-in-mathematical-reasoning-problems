    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t:\n\nx'(t) = 5\ny'(t) = 10t\nz'(t) = 3\n\nx''(t) = 0\ny''(t) = 10\nz''(t) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vector T(t) and its derivative T'(t):\n\nT(t) = <x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)> = <5, 10t, 3>\nT'(t) = <0, 10, 0>\n\nNext, we find the curvature, which is given by the formula:\n\nκ(t) = ||T'(t)|| / ||T(t)||^3\n\nAt t = 2:\n\nT(2) = <5, 20, 3>\n||T(2)|| = √(5^2 + 20^2 + 3^2) = √(25 + 400 + 9) = √434\n\nT'(2) = <0, 10, 0>\n||T'(2)|| = √(0^2 + 10^2 + 0^2) = 10\n\nNow, we can find the curvature κ(2):\n\nκ(2) = ||T'(2)|| / ||T(2)||^3 = 10 / (√434)^3 = 10 / 434√434 ≈ 0.0146\n\nTo find the torsion, we need to compute the cross product of T(t) and T'(t):\n\nN(t) = T(t) x T'(t) = <5, 10t, 3> x <0, 10, 0> = <-30, 0, 50>\n\nNow, we find the derivative of N(t):\n\nN'(t) = <0, 0, 0>\n\nFinally, we compute the torsion τ(t) using the formula:\n\nτ(t) = (N'(t) • T'(t)) / ||N(t)||^2\n\nAt t = 2:\n\nN(2) = <-30, 0, 50>\n||N(2)|| = √((-30)^2 + 0^2 + 50^2) = √(900 + 2500) = √3400\n\nN'(2) = <0, 0, 0>\n\nτ(2) = (N'(2) • T'(2)) / ||N(2)||^2 = (0) / (√3400)^2 = 0\n\nSo, the curvature of the space curve at t = 2 is approximately 0.0146, and the torsion is 0."
