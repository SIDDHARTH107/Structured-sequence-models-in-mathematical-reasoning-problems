    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n```\n|  2   3  -1 |  5\n|  4  -5   3 | -23\n| -2   4   2 | 16\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we will use the first row as the pivot row. We will multiply the first row by 2 and subtract it from the second row. Then, we will multiply the first row by -1 and add it to the third row.\n\n```\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 + R1\n```\n\nResulting matrix:\n\n```\n|  2   3  -1 |  5\n|  0 -11   5 | -33\n|  0   7   1 | 21\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we will use the second row as the pivot row. We will multiply the second row by 7/11 and add it to the third row.\n\n```\nR3 = R3 + (7/11) * R2\n```\n\nResulting matrix:\n\n```\n|  2   3  -1 |  5\n|  0 -11   5 | -33\n|  0   0  12 |  0\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nNow we have a triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z. Starting with the third row:\n\n```\n12z = 0\nz = 0\n```\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow we substitute z back into the second row:\n\n```\n-11y + 5z = -33\n-11y = -33\ny = 3\n```\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we substitute y and z back into the first row:\n\n```\n2x + 3y - z = 5\n2x + 3(3) - 0 = 5\n2x + 9 = 5\n2x = -4\nx = -2\n```\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -2, y = 3, and z = 0."
