    "message_2": "To solve the equation 3^(2x+1) = 27, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite 27 as a power of 3. Since 3^3 = 27, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3^(2x+1) = 3^3\n\nStep 2: Since the bases are the same (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2x + 1 = 3\n\nStep 3: Solve for x. Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 2\n\nStep 4: Divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution for x is x = 1."
