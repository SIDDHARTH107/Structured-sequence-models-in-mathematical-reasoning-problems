    "message_1": "The bases of a trapezium are 12 cm and 18 cm, and its height is 9 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call these sides a and b. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of these sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the median (m) of the trapezium. The median is the line segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides. The length of the median can be found using the formula:\n\nm = (base1 + base2) / 2\n\nm = (12 + 18) / 2\n\nm = 30 / 2\n\nm = 15 cm\n\nNow, let's draw a right triangle using the height (h), half of the median (m/2), and one of the non-parallel sides (let's say side a). The height is 9 cm, and half of the median is 15/2 = 7.5 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of side a:\n\na^2 = (h^2) + ((m/2)^2)\n\na^2 = (9^2) + (7.5^2)\n\na^2 = 81 + 56.25\n\na^2 = 137.25\n\na = √137.25\n\na ≈ 11.72 cm\n\nNow, let's find the length of side b using the same method:\n\nb^2 = (h^2) + ((m/2)^2)\n\nb^2 = (9^2) + (7.5^2)\n\nb^2 = 81 + 56.25\n\nb^2 = 137.25\n\nb = √137.25\n\nb ≈ 11.72 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all four sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = base1 + base2 + side a + side b\n\nPerimeter = 12 + 18 + 11.72 + 11.72\n\nPerimeter ≈ 53.44 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 53.44 cm."
