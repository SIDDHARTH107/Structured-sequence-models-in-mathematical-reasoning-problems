    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\partial_x$, we need to compute the derivative of each component of the tensor field with respect to $x$. Since we are working in a two-dimensional manifold, we can use the standard partial derivatives. The tensor field $T$ has three components: $(x+y) dx \\otimes dy$, $(2x^2 -y^2) dx \\otimes dx$, and $-(3x^2 + xy) dy \\otimes dy$. Let's compute the partial derivatives of each component with respect to $x$:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x+y) = 1$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (2x^2 - y^2) = 4x$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (-3x^2 - xy) = -6x - y$\n\nNow, we can write the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to $\\partial_x$ as:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\partial_x} T = 1 dx \\otimes dy + 4x dx \\otimes dx - (6x + y) dy \\otimes dy$\n\nTo find the covariant derivative at the point $(1,1)$, we substitute $x=1$ and $y=1$ into the expression:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\partial_x} T(1,1) = 1 dx \\otimes dy + 4 dx \\otimes dx - 7 dy \\otimes dy$\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\partial_x$ at the point $(1,1)$ is given by:\n\n$1 dx \\otimes dy + 4 dx \\otimes dx - 7 dy \\otimes dy$."
