    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nConsider a stock whose price follows a geometric Brownian motion given by the stochastic differential equation:\n\ndS(t) = mu*S(t)dt + sigma*S(t)dW(t)\n\nwhere S(t) represents the stock price at time t and W(t) is a Wiener process. Assume that the stock's initial price is $100 and its annual drift and volatility are 10% and 30%, respectively. Find the expected value and variance of the stock price after 1 year.",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value and variance of the stock price after 1 year, we can use the properties of geometric Brownian motion. For a geometric Brownian motion, the expected value and variance of the stock price at time t are given by:\n\nE[S(t)] = S(0) * e^(mu * t)\nVar[S(t)] = S(0)^2 * e^(2 * mu * t) * (e^(sigma^2 * t) - 1)\n\nwhere S(0) is the initial stock price, mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, and t is the time.\n\nIn this problem, we have S(0) = $100, mu = 0.1, sigma = 0.3, and t = 1 year.\n\nFirst, let's find the expected value of the stock price after 1 year:\n\nE[S(1)] = 100 * e^(0.1 * 1) = 100 * e^0.1 ≈ 110.52\n\nNext, let's find the variance of the stock price after 1 year:\n\nVar[S(1)] = 100^2 * e^(2 * 0.1 * 1) * (e^(0.3^2 * 1) - 1) ≈ 10000 * e^0.2 * (e^0.09 - 1) ≈ 12150.64\n\nSo, the expected value of the stock price after 1 year is approximately $110.52, and the variance is approximately $12,150.64."
