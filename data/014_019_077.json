    "message_2": "To create the ciphertext using a transposition cipher with rows of three letters each, we first write the message \"MATHEMATICS\" in rows of three:\n\nMAT\nHEM\nATI\nCS\n\nNow, we put the columns side by side:\n\nM H A C\nA E T S\nT M I\n\nThe ciphertext is created by reading the new arrangement row by row:\n\nMHAC AETS TMI\n\nSo, the ciphertext is \"MHACAETSTMI\"."
