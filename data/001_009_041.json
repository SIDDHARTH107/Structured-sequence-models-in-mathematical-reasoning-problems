    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are those that have the same variables raised to the same powers.\n\nThe like terms in the given expression are:\n\n1. 3x² and -5x²\n2. 4xy, -2xy, and 7xy\n\nNow, we combine these like terms:\n\n(3x² - 5x²) + (4xy - 2xy + 7xy)\n\n-2x² + 9xy\n\nSo, the simplified expression is -2x² + 9xy."
