    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) = sqrt(2) in the interval [0, 2pi], we first isolate sin(x):\n\nsin(x) = sqrt(2) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find all angles x in the interval [0, 2pi] that have a sine value of sqrt(2) / 2. We know that sine is positive in the first and second quadrants, so we will look for angles in those quadrants.\n\nIn the first quadrant, the angle with a sine value of sqrt(2) / 2 is pi/4 (or 45 degrees). This is because sin(pi/4) = sqrt(2) / 2.\n\nIn the second quadrant, the angle with a sine value of sqrt(2) / 2 is 3pi/4 (or 135 degrees). This is because sin(3pi/4) = sqrt(2) / 2.\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 2sin(x) = sqrt(2) in the interval [0, 2pi] are x = pi/4 and x = 3pi/4."
