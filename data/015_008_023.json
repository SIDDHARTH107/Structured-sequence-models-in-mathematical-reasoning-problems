    "message_2": "Let's denote the width of the period-2 window as W2 and the width of the period-4 window as W4. According to the Feigenbaum constant definition, the ratio of the widths of consecutive period-doubling windows converges to the Feigenbaum constant (δ) as the period increases.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nW2 / W4 = δ\n\nWe are given the Feigenbaum constant (δ) as approximately 4.6692. To find the width of the period-4 window (W4) in terms of the Feigenbaum constant, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nW4 = W2 / δ\n\nSince we don't have the exact value of W2, we can express the width of the period-4 window (W4) in terms of the period-2 window (W2) and the Feigenbaum constant (δ):\n\nW4 = W2 / 4.6692"
