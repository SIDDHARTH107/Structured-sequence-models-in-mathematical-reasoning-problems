    "message_1": "Let X be a topological space defined as X = [0,1) ∪ [2,3] with the subspace topology inherited from the usual topology of the real line. Determine whether X is connected or path-connected. If it is path-connected, find a path between the point 0 and 2 in X.",
    "message_2": "X is not connected because it can be written as the union of two non-empty, disjoint, open sets in the subspace topology: [0,1) and [2,3]. Since these sets are open in the subspace topology and their union is X, X is not connected.\n\nNow let's check if X is path-connected. Suppose there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 2. Since f is continuous and [0,1] is connected, the image of f, which is a subset of X, must also be connected. However, there is no connected subset of X that contains both 0 and 2, as they belong to different connected components of X ([0,1) and [2,3], respectively). Therefore, there is no such continuous function f, and X is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, X is neither connected nor path-connected."
