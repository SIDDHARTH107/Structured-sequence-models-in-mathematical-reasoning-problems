    "message_2": "There are infinitely many solutions for x if sin(x) = 0.5, but the most common solutions are:\n\nx = 30° or π/6 (in radians) and x = 150° or 5π/6 (in radians)\n\nThese are the solutions within the range of 0 to 2π (0 to 360°). However, since the sine function is periodic with a period of 2π, you can find other solutions by adding multiples of 2π to these values:\n\nx = 30° + 360°n or π/6 + 2πn and x = 150° + 360°n or 5π/6 + 2πn\n\nwhere n is an integer."
