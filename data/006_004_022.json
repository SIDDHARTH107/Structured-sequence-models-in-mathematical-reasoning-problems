    "message_2": "There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) on a six-sided die. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling the die is 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). The probability of winning the game by rolling an even number can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 3 (even numbers) / 6 (total possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 1/2 or 50%\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game by rolling an even number on a fair six-sided die is 50%."
