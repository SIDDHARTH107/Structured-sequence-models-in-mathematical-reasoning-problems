    "message_1": "Consider a square with side length 2 units. Construct a triangulation of the square by connecting the midpoints of each side. How many triangles are in the resulting triangulation?",
    "message_2": "When you connect the midpoints of each side of the square, you create a smaller square inside the original square. This smaller square is surrounded by four triangles, one on each side. Additionally, the smaller square can be divided into two triangles by drawing a diagonal.\n\nSo, there are 4 triangles surrounding the smaller square and 2 triangles inside the smaller square, resulting in a total of 4 + 2 = 6 triangles in the resulting triangulation."
