    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 7 cm and the width is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (7 + 4) = 2 * 11 = 22 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 22 cm."
