Suppose there exists $x_0 \\in X$ such that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f^n(x_0) = p$, where $f^n$ denotes the $n$-th iterate of $f$. Prove that $p$ is a fixed point of $f$. \n\nUsing the above information, prove that the map $f$ defined by $f(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{x}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ has a unique fixed point.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $p$ is a fixed point of $f$, we need to show that $f(p) = p$. Since $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f^n(x_0) = p$, we have that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $d(f^n(x_0), p) < \\epsilon$.\n\nNow, consider the sequence $\\{f^{n+1}(x_0)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$. We have that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f^{n+1}(x_0) = p$ as well. Thus, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \\geq M$, $d(f^{n+1}(x_0), p) < \\epsilon$.\n\nLet $n_0 = \\max\\{N, M\\}$. Then, for $n \\geq n_0$, we have both $d(f^n(x_0), p) < \\epsilon$ and $d(f^{n+1}(x_0), p) < \\epsilon$. Since $f$ is continuous, we have that $d(f(f^n(x_0)), f(p)) < \\epsilon$. But $f(f^n(x_0)) = f^{n+1}(x_0)$, so we have $d(f^{n+1}(x_0), f(p)) < \\epsilon$.\n\nNow, we have that $d(f^{n+1}(x_0), p) < \\epsilon$ and $d(f^{n+1}(x_0), f(p)) < \\epsilon$. By the triangle inequality, we have that $d(p, f(p)) \\leq d(p, f^{n+1}(x_0)) + d(f^{n+1}(x_0), f(p)) < 2\\epsilon$. Since $\\epsilon > 0$ is arbitrary, we have that $d(p, f(p)) = 0$, which implies that $f(p) = p$. Thus, $p$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n\nNow, let's consider the map $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{x}$ on $(0, \\infty)$. To show that it has a unique fixed point, we first need to show that it has at least one fixed point. Let $g(x) = f(x) - x = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{x} - x = \\frac{1}{2}x - x + \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{x}$. We want to find $x$ such that $g(x) = 0$.\n\nTaking the derivative of $g(x)$, we get $g'(x) = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{-1}{x^2}$. Setting $g'(x) = 0$, we have $-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{-1}{x^2} = 0$, which implies $x^2 = 2$. Thus, $x = \\sqrt{2}$ is the unique critical point of $g(x)$.\n\nSince $g'(x) > 0$ for $x < \\sqrt{2}$ and $g'(x) < 0$ for $x > \\sqrt{2}$, we have that $g(x)$ is increasing for $x < \\sqrt{2}$ and decreasing for $x > \\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $g(x)$ has a unique global maximum at $x = \\sqrt{2}$. Since $g(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} > 0$, we have that $g(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in (0, \\infty)$.\n\nNow, since $g(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in (0, \\infty)$, we have that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in (0, \\infty)$. Thus, the function $f(x)$ has no fixed points in $(0, \\infty)$, which contradicts our initial assumption that $p$ is a fixed point of $f$. Therefore, the map $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{x}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ has no fixed points."
