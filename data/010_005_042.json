Suppose further that A and B are disjoint and that their union is connected. What is the minimum number of additional points in X that we need to adjoin to A and B respectively in order to make A and B path-connected?",
    "message_2": "To make A and B path-connected, we need to ensure that there is a continuous path between any two points in A and any two points in B. Since A and B are disjoint, we can consider them separately.\n\nFor A, with 4 points, we need to ensure that there is a continuous path between any two points. In the worst case, we might need to add one point to connect two pairs of points, creating a path between all 4 points. So, we need to add at least 1 point to A.\n\nFor B, with 3 points, we need to ensure that there is a continuous path between any two points. In the worst case, we might need to add one point to connect the three points, creating a path between all 3 points. So, we need to add at least 1 point to B.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of additional points in X that we need to adjoin to A and B respectively in order to make A and B path-connected is 1 + 1 = 2 points."
