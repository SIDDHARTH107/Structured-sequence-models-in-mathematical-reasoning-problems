    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 4 items from 8 items without repetition and where order doesn't matter, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (8 in this case) and k is the number of items to choose (4 in this case).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1)\n\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo there are 70 ways to choose 4 items from 8 items without repetition and where order doesn't matter."
