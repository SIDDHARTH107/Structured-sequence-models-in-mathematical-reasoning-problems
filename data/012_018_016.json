    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges whose removal results in a disconnected or trivial graph.\n\nMenger's theorem states that the edge connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\nLet's denote the edge connectivity of the given graph as λ. Since the graph has 10 vertices and 20 edges, the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph is at most 20/10 = 2. In other words, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 2 or less.\n\nNow, consider the vertex with the smallest degree in the graph. If we remove the edges connected to this vertex, the graph will become disconnected. Since the vertex has a degree of 2 or less, we need to remove at most 2 edges to disconnect the graph.\n\nTherefore, the edge connectivity of the given graph is λ = 2."
