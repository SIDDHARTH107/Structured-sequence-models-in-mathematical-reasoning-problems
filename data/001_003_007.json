    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we want to make the coefficients of y's in both equations the same. We can do this by multiplying the second equation by 3:\n\n1) 2x + 3y = 10\n2) 12x - 3y = 24\n\nNow, we can add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(2x + 3y) + (12x - 3y) = 10 + 24\n2x + 12x = 34\n14x = 34\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 34 / 14\nx = 17 / 7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2(17/7) + 3y = 10\n\n34/7 + 3y = 10\n\nNow, we need to isolate y:\n\n3y = 10 - 34/7\n3y = (70 - 34) / 7\n3y = 36 / 7\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = (36 / 7) / 3\ny = 36 / 21\ny = 12 / 7\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 17/7 and y = 12/7"
