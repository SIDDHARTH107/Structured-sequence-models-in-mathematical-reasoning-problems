    "message_1": "A long straight wire carrying a current of 2A is located at $x=0$ and $y=0$ in the xy-plane. The current is flowing in the positive y-direction. A magnetic field is generated around the wire according to Ampere's law $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} =\\mu_{0}\\vec{j}$. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point $P$ located on the $x$-axis at $x=5$ meters. Use $\\mu_{0}=4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}$ H/m.",
    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P, we can use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\n$$d\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_{0}I}{4\\pi} \\frac{d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r}}{r^3}$$\n\nwhere $d\\vec{B}$ is the infinitesimal magnetic field at point P due to an infinitesimal length $d\\vec{l}$ of the wire, $\\mu_{0}$ is the permeability of free space, $I$ is the current in the wire, $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the wire element to point P, and $r$ is the distance from the wire element to point P.\n\nSince the wire is long and straight, we can simplify the Biot-Savart law by considering the symmetry of the problem. The magnetic field at point P will be in the $\\hat{z}$ direction (perpendicular to the xy-plane) due to the right-hand rule. The magnitude of the magnetic field at point P can be found using Ampere's law:\n\n$$\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_{0}I_{enc}$$\n\nWe can choose a circular Amperian loop of radius $r = 5$ meters centered at the wire. The magnetic field is tangent to the loop, and the integral becomes:\n\n$$B \\oint dl = B(2\\pi r) = \\mu_{0}I_{enc}$$\n\nSince the entire current of 2A is enclosed by the loop, $I_{enc} = 2$ A. We can now solve for the magnitude of the magnetic field B:\n\n$$B(2\\pi r) = \\mu_{0}I_{enc}$$\n$$B(2\\pi \\cdot 5) = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7})(2)$$\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\n$$B = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7})(2)}{2\\pi \\cdot 5}$$\n$$B = 4 \\times 10^{-7} \\, T$$\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at point P is $4 \\times 10^{-7}$ T, and its direction is in the positive z-direction (out of the xy-plane)."
