    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The total length of a Hilbert curve can be determined by the number of straight segments in the curve. With each increase in order, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 1, there are 4 segments.\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 2, there are 4^2 = 16 segments.\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, there are 4^3 = 64 segments.\n\nTherefore, for a Hilbert curve of order 4, there are 4^4 = 256 segments.\n\nSince each straight segment in the curve has a length of 1 unit, the total length of a Hilbert curve of order 4 is 256 * 1 = 256 units."
