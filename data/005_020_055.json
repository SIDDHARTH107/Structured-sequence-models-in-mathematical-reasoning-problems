    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on a fair 6-sided dice, we first need to determine the probability of this event occurring in a single roll. There are 3 favorable outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, or 3) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). So, the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 in a single roll is:\n\nP(rolling â‰¤ 3) = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of this event occurring in 1000 simulations (rolls) using Monte Carlo simulation. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we would randomly generate 1000 rolls and count the number of times we get a number less than or equal to 3. Then, we would divide this count by the total number of simulations (1000) to get the probability.\n\nHowever, since the dice is fair, the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 will remain the same in each simulation. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 in 1000 simulations is also 1/2 or 0.5."
