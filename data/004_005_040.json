    "message_2": "Let W(t) represent the amount of water in the tank after t minutes. Since the water is draining at a rate of 20 liters per minute, we can write the differential equation as:\n\ndW/dt = -20\n\nNow, we need to solve this differential equation to find the function W(t). To do this, we can integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫dW = ∫-20 dt\n\nW(t) = -20t + C\n\nSince the tank initially contains 1000 liters of water, we can use this information to find the value of the constant C:\n\nW(0) = 1000\n-20(0) + C = 1000\nC = 1000\n\nSo, the function that represents the amount of water in the tank after t minutes is:\n\nW(t) = -20t + 1000"
