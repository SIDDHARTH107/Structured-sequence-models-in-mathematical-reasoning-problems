    "message_1": "A company is considering launching a new line of products, but they want to estimate their profits before investing in the production. To do this, they use Monte Carlo simulation and simulate the market demand for their new product line. Based on the simulation, they estimate that the demand will be normally distributed with a mean of 10,000 units and a standard deviation of 2,000 units. \n\nThe company sells each unit for $50 and each unit costs $30 to produce. What is the estimated mean profit and the standard deviation of profit for the company?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the estimated mean profit, we first need to find the profit per unit. The profit per unit is the selling price minus the production cost:\n\nProfit per unit = $50 - $30 = $20\n\nNow, we can find the estimated mean profit by multiplying the mean demand by the profit per unit:\n\nMean profit = Mean demand * Profit per unit = 10,000 units * $20 = $200,000\n\nTo calculate the standard deviation of profit, we need to multiply the standard deviation of demand by the profit per unit:\n\nStandard deviation of profit = Standard deviation of demand * Profit per unit = 2,000 units * $20 = $40,000\n\nSo, the estimated mean profit is $200,000, and the standard deviation of profit is $40,000."
