    "message_2": "The Cantor set is formed by iteratively removing the middle third of each segment. In each iteration, the remaining length is 2/3 of the previous length. \n\nLet L_n be the total length of the Cantor set after the nth iteration. Then, L_n = (2/3)^n * L_0, where L_0 is the initial length, which is 1.\n\nFor the 5th iteration, we have:\n\nL_5 = (2/3)^5 * L_0\nL_5 = (32/243) * 1\nL_5 = 32/243\n\nSo, the total length of the Cantor set after the 5th iteration is 32/243."
