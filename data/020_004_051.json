    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of bicycles - Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes. The production cost of a Mountain Bike is $400 and the production cost of a Road Bike is $300. The selling price of a Mountain Bike is $800 and the selling price of a Road Bike is $700. The factory has a budget of $24,000 for production and can produce a maximum of 60 bikes. How many bikes of each type should the factory produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Mountain Bikes and y be the number of Road Bikes.\n\nThe profit for each Mountain Bike is $800 - $400 = $400, and the profit for each Road Bike is $700 - $300 = $400. So, the total profit can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 400x + 400y\n\nThe factory has a budget of $24,000 for production, so the total cost of producing x Mountain Bikes and y Road Bikes should not exceed $24,000:\n\n400x + 300y ≤ 24,000\n\nThe factory can produce a maximum of 60 bikes:\n\nx + y ≤ 60\n\nNow we need to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit while satisfying the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's solve the budget constraint equation for y:\n\ny ≤ (24,000 - 400x) / 300\n\nNow, let's plug this into the maximum bikes constraint:\n\nx + (24,000 - 400x) / 300 ≤ 60\n\nMultiplying both sides by 300 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n300x + 24,000 - 400x ≤ 18,000\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n-100x ≤ -6,000\n\nDividing both sides by -100:\n\nx ≥ 60\n\nSince x + y ≤ 60, the maximum number of Mountain Bikes (x) that can be produced is 60. However, producing 60 Mountain Bikes would exceed the budget constraint. So, we need to find the maximum number of Mountain Bikes that can be produced within the budget constraint.\n\nFrom the budget constraint equation:\n\n400x + 300y ≤ 24,000\n\nIf x = 60, then:\n\n400(60) + 300y ≤ 24,000\n\n24,000 + 300y ≤ 24,000\n\n300y ≤ 0\n\ny ≤ 0\n\nThis means that if the factory produces 60 Mountain Bikes, they cannot produce any Road Bikes. However, since the profit for each bike is the same ($400), the factory should produce a mix of both types of bikes to maximize their profit.\n\nTo find the optimal mix, let's go back to the budget constraint equation:\n\n400x + 300y ≤ 24,000\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 240\n\nNow, we can use trial and error to find the optimal mix of bikes:\n\n1. If x = 40, then:\n\n4(40) + 3y ≤ 240\n\n160 + 3y ≤ 240\n\n3y ≤ 80\n\ny ≤ 26.67\n\nIn this case, the factory can produce 40 Mountain Bikes and 26 Road Bikes (rounded down to the nearest whole number).\n\n2. If x = 45, then:\n\n4(45) + 3y ≤ 240\n\n180 + 3y ≤ 240\n\n3y ≤ 60\n\ny ≤ 20\n\nIn this case, the factory can produce 45 Mountain Bikes and 20 Road Bikes.\n\nComparing the two options, producing 40 Mountain Bikes and 26 Road Bikes results in a total of 66 bikes, while producing 45 Mountain Bikes and 20 Road Bikes results in a total of 65 bikes. Since the profit per bike is the same, the factory should produce 40 Mountain Bikes and 26 Road Bikes to maximize their profit."
