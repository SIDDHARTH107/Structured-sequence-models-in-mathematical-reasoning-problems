    "message_2": "This statement is known as the Goldbach Conjecture, which is an unsolved problem in number theory. It states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Although it has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values and found to be true, no general proof or counterexample has been found yet.\n\nSo, according to the Goldbach Conjecture, all even numbers greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, but we cannot provide a definitive list or proof for this statement."
