    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, it is known that the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring is 0.03. If a sample of 500 products is taken, what is the probability that at least 15 products will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the sample size (500 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective products (we want to find the probability of at least 15)\n- p is the probability of a single product being defective (0.03)\n\nHowever, since we want to find the probability of at least 15 defective products, we need to calculate the probability of having 15, 16, 17, ..., 500 defective products and sum them up. This can be quite cumbersome, so we can use the complement rule instead. The complement rule states that:\n\nP(X ≥ k) = 1 - P(X < k)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of having at least 15 defective products, so we can find the probability of having less than 15 defective products (0, 1, 2, ..., 14) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\n\nP(X < 15) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 14)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 15) = Σ [C(500, k) * (0.03)^k * (1-0.03)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 14\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 15) ≈ 0.5718\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability of having at least 15 defective products:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = 1 - P(X < 15) = 1 - 0.5718 ≈ 0.4282\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 15 defective products in a sample of 500 is approximately 0.4282 or 42.82%."
