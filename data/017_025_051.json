    "message_1": "What are the total number of non-abelian groups of order 120, and how many of them are isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the total number of non-abelian groups of order 120. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 × 3 × 5. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nn(120) = n(2^3) × n(3) × n(5)\n\nn(2^3) = 5 (there are 5 groups of order 8)\nn(3) = 1 (there is only 1 group of order 3, which is cyclic)\nn(5) = 1 (there is only 1 group of order 5, which is cyclic)\n\nn(120) = 5 × 1 × 1 = 5\n\nSo there are 5 groups of order 120. However, one of these groups is abelian (the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 8, 3, and 5), so there are 4 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nNow, let's consider the group A5 × C2 × C2. The order of this group is |A5| × |C2| × |C2| = 60 × 2 × 2 = 240, which is not equal to 120. Therefore, none of the non-abelian groups of order 120 are isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2."
