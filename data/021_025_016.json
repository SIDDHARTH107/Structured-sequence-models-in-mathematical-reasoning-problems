    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, since the given function is a cubic polynomial, we can find the maximum value using calculus, which is more straightforward and accurate.\n\nTo find the maximum value of f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 - 15x in the range [0, 5], we first find the critical points by taking the first derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x - 15\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x - 15 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 5 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 5 and x = -1. Since -1 is not in the range [0, 5], we only consider x = 5.\n\nNow, we check the endpoints of the range and the critical point to find the maximum value:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 - 15(0) = 0\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 6(5)^2 - 15(5) = 125 - 150 - 75 = -100\n\nSince f(5) is the largest value among the endpoints and the critical point, the maximum value of the function in the range [0, 5] is -100, which occurs at x = 5."
