    "message_2": "To determine if graphs G and H are isomorphic, we can compare their properties and try to find a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices that preserves adjacency.\n\nFirst, let's compare the degree sequences of both graphs. The degree sequence is a list of the degrees of the vertices in non-increasing order.\n\nDegree sequence of G: (2, 2, 2, 2)\nDegree sequence of H: (2, 2, 2, 2)\n\nThe degree sequences are the same, which is a necessary condition for isomorphism, but it is not sufficient. We need to check if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices that preserves adjacency.\n\nLet's try to find an isomorphism between the two graphs:\n\nWe can map vertex 1 of G to vertex 1 of H. Then, vertex 2 of G is adjacent to vertex 1 of G, so it must be mapped to a vertex adjacent to vertex 1 of H. We can map vertex 2 of G to vertex 2 of H. \n\nNow, vertex 3 of G is adjacent to vertex 2 of G, so it must be mapped to a vertex adjacent to vertex 2 of H. We can map vertex 3 of G to vertex 4 of H. Finally, vertex 4 of G is adjacent to vertices 1 and 3 of G, so it must be mapped to a vertex adjacent to vertices 1 and 4 of H. We can map vertex 4 of G to vertex 3 of H.\n\nThe isomorphism can be represented as a function f: {1, 2, 3, 4} -> {1, 2, 4, 3}, where f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 4, and f(4) = 3.\n\nNow let's check if this mapping preserves adjacency:\n\n- Vertices 1 and 2 are adjacent in G, and f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 2 are adjacent in H.\n- Vertices 1 and 4 are adjacent in G, and f(1) = 1 and f(4) = 3 are adjacent in H.\n- Vertices 2 and 3 are adjacent in G, and f(2) = 2 and f(3) = 4 are adjacent in H.\n- Vertices 3 and 4 are adjacent in G, and f(3) = 4 and f(4) = 3 are adjacent in H.\n\nSince the mapping f preserves adjacency, graphs G and H are isomorphic, and the isomorphism is given by the function f."
