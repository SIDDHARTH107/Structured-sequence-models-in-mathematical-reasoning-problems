    "message_2": "1) In the given graph, a cut vertex is a vertex whose removal (along with its incident edges) increases the number of connected components. The cut vertices in this graph are 2 and 3. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components. There are no bridges in this graph.\n\n2) If we remove vertex 2 and all its incident edges from the graph, we obtain the following graph:\n\n```\n1      3 ---- 4\n|      |      |\n5 ---- 6 ---- 7\n```\n\nAfter removing vertex 2, the graph is split into two connected components:\n\n- Component 1: {1, 5}\n- Component 2: {3, 4, 6, 7}\n\nSo, we obtain 2 connected components."
