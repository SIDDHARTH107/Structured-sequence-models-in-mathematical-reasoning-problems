    "message_1": "A math student tossed a coin 25 times and got heads 18 times. What is the probability that the next coin toss will also be a head, according to inductive reasoning?",
    "message_2": "Inductive reasoning suggests that we can predict the future based on past experiences or patterns. In this case, the student got heads 18 times out of 25 tosses. To find the probability of getting a head in the next toss based on this pattern, we can use the following formula:\n\nProbability of getting a head = (Number of heads) / (Total number of tosses)\n\nProbability of getting a head = 18 / 25\n\nProbability of getting a head = 0.72 or 72%\n\nAccording to inductive reasoning, the probability of getting a head in the next coin toss is 72%. However, it's important to note that in reality, each coin toss is an independent event, and the true probability of getting a head is always 50% (assuming a fair coin)."
