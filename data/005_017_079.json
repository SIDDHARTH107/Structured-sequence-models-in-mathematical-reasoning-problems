    "message_1": "A company conducted a survey on 100 customers. The data collected includes their age, annual income and spending habits. Using principal component analysis, calculate the first principal component of the data set.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the first principal component of the data set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data: Since the variables (age, annual income, and spending habits) are measured in different units, we need to standardize the data to make them comparable. This is done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable.\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix: Compute the covariance matrix for the standardized data. The covariance matrix shows the correlation between each pair of variables.\n\n3. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors: Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each principal component.\n\n4. Select the first principal component: Choose the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue as the first principal component. This component explains the most variance in the data.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data, we cannot perform these calculations. However, if you provide the data, we can help you with the calculations."
