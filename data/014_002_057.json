    "message_1": "Suppose Alice and Bob want to establish a shared secret key using Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice has a public key of 11 and a private key of 3. Bob has a public key of 7 and a private key of 5. What is the value of the shared secret key that they can use for secure communication?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Alice computes the value A = (public key of Bob)^(private key of Alice) mod p, where p is a prime number.\n2. Bob computes the value B = (public key of Alice)^(private key of Bob) mod p.\n\nThe shared secret key will be the same for both Alice and Bob, as (A^private key of Bob) mod p = (B^private key of Alice) mod p.\n\nLet's assume p = 23 (a common prime number used in Diffie-Hellman key exchange).\n\n1. Alice computes A = (7^3) mod 23 = 343 mod 23 = 6.\n2. Bob computes B = (11^5) mod 23 = 161051 mod 23 = 6.\n\nNow, Alice and Bob both have the same value (6), which is their shared secret key. They can use this key for secure communication."
