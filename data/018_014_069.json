    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the Cartesian products A x B and A' x B', and then find their complements. Finally, we will find the difference between the two complements.\n\nLet's start with A x B:\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the complements of A and B. Since we don't have a universal set defined, we can't find the exact complements. However, we can still find the difference between the complements of the Cartesian products.\n\nLet's assume U is the universal set, and A' and B' are subsets of U. Then, A' x B' is a subset of U x U. Since (A x B)' is also a subset of U x U, we can find the difference between the two complements by finding the elements that are in (A x B)' but not in (A' x B').\n\n(A x B)' consists of all elements in U x U that are not in A x B. Similarly, (A' x B') consists of all elements in U x U that are not in A x B. Therefore, the difference between the two complements is the empty set:\n\n(A x B)' - (A' x B') = âˆ…"
