    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. The order of the curve indicates the number of iterations used to generate the curve. \n\nFor a Peano curve of order 3, we can calculate the length of each line segment and add them up. In each iteration, the number of line segments increases by a factor of 9, and the length of each segment decreases by a factor of 3. \n\nAt order 1, there are 9 line segments, each of length 1/3 (since the curve is contained in a unit square).\n\nAt order 2, there are 9^2 = 81 line segments, each of length 1/3^2 = 1/9.\n\nAt order 3, there are 9^3 = 729 line segments, each of length 1/3^3 = 1/27.\n\nTo find the total length of the Peano curve of order 3, we multiply the number of line segments by the length of each segment:\n\nLength = 729 * (1/27) = 27\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve of order 3 is 27."
