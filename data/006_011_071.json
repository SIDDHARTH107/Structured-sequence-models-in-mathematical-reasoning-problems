    "message_1": "A manufacturing unit has reported an average of 2 accidents in a month due to machine failures. What is the probability that in a particular month, the number of accidents due to machine failures will be exactly 3?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a fixed average rate of occurrence (λ).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x events occurring\n- λ is the average rate of occurrence (in this case, 2 accidents per month)\n- x is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 3 accidents)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(3) = (e^(-2) * 2^3) / 3!\n\nP(3) = (0.13534 * 8) / 6\n\nP(3) = 1.08272 / 6\n\nP(3) ≈ 0.18045\n\nSo, the probability that there will be exactly 3 accidents due to machine failures in a particular month is approximately 0.18045 or 18.045%."
