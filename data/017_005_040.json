    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 divides 125, and\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. \n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1\nIf there is only one 5-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this unique 5-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 5^3, P is a group of order 125. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P must be isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n1. Z_125 (cyclic group of order 125)\n2. Z_25 × Z_5 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 25 and a cyclic group of order 5)\n3. Z_5 × Z_5 × Z_5 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5)\n\nHowever, since P is a p-group (a group of order p^n for some prime p and integer n), it must have a nontrivial center. The center of the third option, Z_5 × Z_5 × Z_5, is the entire group, which contradicts the assumption that P is a proper subgroup of G. Therefore, P must be isomorphic to either Z_125 or Z_25 × Z_5.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z_125, then G is cyclic, as G is isomorphic to its unique 5-Sylow subgroup.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z_25 × Z_5, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25, as G is isomorphic to its unique 5-Sylow subgroup.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 25\nIf there are 25 5-Sylow subgroups in G, then there are 25 * 5^2 = 125 elements of order 5 in G. However, this accounts for all the elements in G, which means that G cannot have an element of order 125. Therefore, G cannot be cyclic in this case.\n\nNow, let P be any 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 5^3, P must be isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n1. Z_125 (cyclic group of order 125)\n2. Z_25 × Z_5 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 25 and a cyclic group of order 5)\n3. Z_5 × Z_5 × Z_5 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5)\n\nAs we have already established that G cannot be cyclic, P cannot be isomorphic to Z_125. Furthermore, since P is a p-group, it must have a nontrivial center. The center of the third option, Z_5 × Z_5 × Z_5, is the entire group, which contradicts the assumption that P is a proper subgroup of G. Therefore, P must be isomorphic to Z_25 × Z_5.\n\nSince P is a 5-Sylow subgroup of G and is isomorphic to Z_25 × Z_5, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 125 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
