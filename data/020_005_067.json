    "message_1": "A toy manufacturing company has 8 pounds of plastic and 6 pounds of metal to make toys. Each plastic toy requires 2 pounds of plastic and 1 pound of metal, while each metal toy requires 1 pound of plastic and 3 pounds of metal. The company wants to maximize the profit by selling the toys. The profit for each plastic toy is $5 and for each metal toy, it is $8. How many plastic and metal toys should the company produce to maximize the profit? What is the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of plastic toys and y be the number of metal toys.\n\nThe constraints for the materials are:\n2x + y ≤ 8 (plastic)\nx + 3y ≤ 6 (metal)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP(x, y) = 5x + 8y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. If x = 0:\ny ≤ 8/2 = 4 (plastic constraint)\ny ≤ 6/3 = 2 (metal constraint)\n\n2. If y = 0:\nx ≤ 8/2 = 4 (plastic constraint)\nx ≤ 6/1 = 6 (metal constraint)\n\nSo, the feasible region is defined by the following points: (0, 0), (0, 2), (4, 0), and the intersection point of the two constraint lines.\n\nTo find the intersection point, we can solve the system of equations:\n2x + y = 8\nx + 3y = 6\n\nSubtracting the second equation from twice the first equation, we get:\ny = 2\n\nSubstituting y back into the second equation:\nx + 3(2) = 6\nx = 6 - 6 = 0\n\nSo, the intersection point is (0, 2).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of the feasible region points:\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\nP(0, 2) = 5(0) + 8(2) = $16\nP(4, 0) = 5(4) + 8(0) = $20\n\nThe maximum profit is $20, which occurs when the company produces 4 plastic toys and 0 metal toys."
