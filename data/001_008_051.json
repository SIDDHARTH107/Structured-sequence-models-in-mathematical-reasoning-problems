Draw a number line with 10 as a reference point.\n2. Place an open circle at 10, since the inequality is \"greater than\" and not \"greater than or equal to.\"\n3. Shade the region to the right of the open circle, indicating that all values greater than 10 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph of the solution on a number line looks like this:\n\n----------(10)>>>>>>>>>>"
