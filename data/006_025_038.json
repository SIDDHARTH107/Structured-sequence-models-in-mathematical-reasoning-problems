The probability of the fire juggler performing before the clown is 1/4, and the probability of the acrobat performing after the trapeze artist is 1/2. What is the probability that the fire juggler performs before the clown and the acrobat performs after the trapeze artist?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both events happening, we can multiply the individual probabilities together. \n\nThe probability of the fire juggler performing before the clown is 1/4, and the probability of the acrobat performing after the trapeze artist is 1/2. \n\nSo, the probability of both events happening is:\n\n(1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\nTherefore, the probability that the fire juggler performs before the clown and the acrobat performs after the trapeze artist is 1/8."
