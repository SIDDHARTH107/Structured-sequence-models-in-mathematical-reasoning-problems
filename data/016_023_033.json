    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor (step size).\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces (4 smaller squares and 1 central square) and the scaling factor s = 5.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(5) = 1\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a step size of 5 is 1, regardless of the number of iterations."
