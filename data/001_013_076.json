    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\sqrt{x+5} = 3$, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n$(\\sqrt{x+5})^2 = 3^2$\n\nStep 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.\n$x+5 = 9$\n\nStep 3: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate x.\n$x = 9 - 5$\n\nStep 4: Simplify to find the value of x.\n$x = 4$\n\nSo, the solution to the equation $\\sqrt{x+5} = 3$ is $x = 4$."
