    "message_1": "Consider the following decision problem: Given a binary string of length n, is it the case that the binary representation of a prime number less than or equal to 2^n contains exactly k ones? \n\nWhat is the smallest n for which the problem is decidable and how fast does the decision procedure run on an input of length n?",
    "message_2": "The problem is decidable for any n, as we can always check all prime numbers less than or equal to 2^n and count the number of ones in their binary representation. The smallest n for which the problem is decidable is n = 1, as there is only one prime number (2) less than or equal to 2^1, and its binary representation (10) contains one 1.\n\nTo determine the running time of the decision procedure, we can consider the following steps:\n\n1. Generate all prime numbers less than or equal to 2^n.\n2. Convert each prime number to its binary representation.\n3. Count the number of ones in each binary representation.\n4. Check if any prime number has exactly k ones in its binary representation.\n\nStep 1 can be done using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n * log(log(n))) for generating all prime numbers up to n. However, since we are generating prime numbers up to 2^n, the time complexity becomes O(2^n * log(log(2^n))) = O(2^n * log(n)).\n\nStep 2 has a time complexity of O(log(p)) for converting a single prime number p to its binary representation. Since we are converting all prime numbers less than or equal to 2^n, the overall time complexity for this step is O(π(2^n) * log(2^n)), where π(2^n) is the number of prime numbers less than or equal to 2^n. According to the Prime Number Theorem, π(2^n) is approximately 2^n / log(2^n), so the time complexity for this step is O(2^n).\n\nStep 3 has a time complexity of O(log(p)) for counting the number of ones in the binary representation of a single prime number p. Similar to step 2, the overall time complexity for this step is O(2^n).\n\nStep 4 has a time complexity of O(π(2^n)) for checking if any prime number has exactly k ones in its binary representation. Using the Prime Number Theorem, this is approximately O(2^n / log(2^n)).\n\nCombining the time complexities of all steps, the overall time complexity of the decision procedure is O(2^n * log(n) + 2^n + 2^n + 2^n / log(2^n)). The dominant term is O(2^n * log(n)), so the decision procedure runs in O(2^n * log(n)) time on an input of length n."
