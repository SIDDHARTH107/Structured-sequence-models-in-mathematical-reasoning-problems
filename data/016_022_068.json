    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal constructed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The height of the pyramid refers to the number of iterations or levels of recursion.\n\nFor a Sierpinski pyramid of height 4, we can calculate the number of triangular faces using the formula:\n\nNumber of faces = 4^n - 1\n\nwhere n is the height of the pyramid.\n\nNumber of faces = 4^4 - 1\nNumber of faces = 256 - 1\nNumber of faces = 255\n\nSo, a Sierpinski pyramid of height 4 has 255 triangular faces."
