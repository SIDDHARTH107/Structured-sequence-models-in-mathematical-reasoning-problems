    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A with respect to U, we need to find all the elements in U that are not in A. \n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. So, A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nSince A and A' have no common elements (A contains elements 1 to 5, and A' contains elements 6 to 10), their intersection is the empty set.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThus, we have shown that the intersection of set A and its complement A' equals the empty set."
