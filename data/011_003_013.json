    "message_2": "Let's use the notation (B, L, R) to represent the number of black, blue, and red notebooks, respectively. We need to find all the possible combinations that add up to 5 notebooks with no more than 2 of each color.\n\n1. (2, 2, 1): Two black, two blue, and one red notebook. There are 3 ways to arrange this combination, as the single red notebook can be replaced with a black or blue one:\n   - (2, 2, 1)\n   - (2, 1, 2)\n   - (1, 2, 2)\n\n2.
