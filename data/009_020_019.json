    "message_2": "To find the optimal control u that minimizes the quadratic cost function J(u), we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function H:\n\nH(x, y, u, p) = 4y² + u² + p(3x - y - 2u),\n\nwhere p is the costate variable.\n\nThe necessary conditions for optimality are:\n\n1. dy/dt = ∂H/∂p = 3x - y - 2u (the given differential equation)\n2. dp/dt = -∂H/∂y = -8y + p\n3. ∂H/∂u = 0 => 2u - 2p = 0 => u = p\n\nNow, we have a new system of differential equations:\n\n1. dy/dt = 3x - y - 2p\n2. dp/dt = -8y + p\n3. u = p\n\nWe also have the boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y(1) = 2. To find the boundary condition for p, we use the transversality condition:\n\np(1) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the system of differential equations:\n\n1. dy/dt = 3x - y - 2p\n2. dp/dt = -8y + p\n\nwith the boundary conditions y(0) = 0, y(1) = 2, and p(1) = 0.\n\nSolving this system of differential equations, we get:\n\ny(t) = 2t + (1/2)t²\np(t) = -2t + 2\n\nNow, we can find the optimal control u using the equation u = p:\n\nu(t) = -2t + 2\n\nSo, the optimal control u that minimizes the quadratic cost function J(u) is:\n\nu(t) = -2t + 2"
