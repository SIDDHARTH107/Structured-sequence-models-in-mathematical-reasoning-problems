    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a quadratic equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, we can try to factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, the quadratic formula is more suitable. The quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nFor our equation, a = 3, b = -6, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)² - 4(3)(2))) / (2 * 3)\n\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 6\n\nx = (6 ± √12) / 6\n\nx = (6 ± 2√3) / 6\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\nx = (2(3 ± √3)) / 6\n\nAnd simplify by canceling out the common factor of 2:\n\nx = (3 ± √3) / 3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = (3 + √3) / 3 and x = (3 - √3) / 3."
