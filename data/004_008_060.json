    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve of f(x) at the point where x is equal to 4, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 4.\n\nThe function is f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x.\n\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x)/dx = 4x + 3\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 4(4) + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve of f(x) at the point where x is equal to 4 is 19."
