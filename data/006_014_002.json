    "message_2": "To find the probability of two independent events both occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event. In this case, the probability of one engine experiencing a catastrophic failure is 2% or 0.02. \n\nSo, the probability of both engines experiencing a catastrophic failure during the five-hour flight is:\n\n0.02 (probability of engine 1 failing) * 0.02 (probability of engine 2 failing) = 0.0004 or 0.04%\n\nThe probability of both engines experiencing a catastrophic failure during the five-hour flight is 0.04%."
