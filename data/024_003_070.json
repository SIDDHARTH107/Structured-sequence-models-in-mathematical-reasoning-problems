    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 - 4, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2 - 4)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\nSu = ∂S/∂u = (1, 0, 2u)\nSv = ∂S/∂v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\nSuu = ∂²S/∂u² = (0, 0, 2)\nSuv = ∂²S/∂u∂v = (0, 0, 0)\nSvv = ∂²S/∂v² = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = <Su, Su> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <Su, Sv> = 2uv\nG = <Sv, Sv> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\ne = <Suu, N> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nf = <Suv, N> = 0\ng = <Svv, N> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\nK = (eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = (2 * 2 / (1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)^2) / ((1 + 4u^2)(1 + 4v^2) - (2uv)^2)\n\nNow, we evaluate K at the point (1, 1, 2), which corresponds to the parameter values u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nK = (4 / (1 + 4 + 4)^2) / ((1 + 4)(1 + 4) - (2 * 1 * 1)^2)\nK = (4 / 81) / (5 * 5 - 4)\nK = (4 / 81) / 21\n\nK = 4 / (81 * 21)\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at the point (1, 1, 2) is K = 4 / (81 * 21)."
