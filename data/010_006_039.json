    "message_2": "To compute the third homotopy group of $S^4$, we can use the fact that the homotopy groups of spheres are known to satisfy the following property: for $n > k$, $\\pi_k(S^n)$ is isomorphic to $\\pi_{k-1}(S^{n-1})$. This property is a consequence of the Freudenthal suspension theorem.\n\nUsing this property, we can compute $\\pi_3(S^4)$ as follows:\n\n1. $\\pi_3(S^4) \\cong \\pi_2(S^3)$\n2. $\\pi_2(S^3) \\cong \\pi_1(S^2)$\n3. $\\pi_1(S^2)$ is trivial, since $S^2$ is simply connected.\n\nTherefore, $\\pi_3(S^4)$ is trivial, which means $\\pi_3(S^4) \\cong \\{0\\}$."
