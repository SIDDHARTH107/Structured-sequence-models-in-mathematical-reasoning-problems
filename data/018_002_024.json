    "message_2": "To find the intersection of set A and set B, we look for the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of set A and set B is {2, 4}.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this intersection is a subset of set A and set B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In this case, we can see that both 2 and 4 are members of set A and set B. Therefore, the intersection of set A and set B, which is {2, 4}, is indeed a subset of both set A and set B."
