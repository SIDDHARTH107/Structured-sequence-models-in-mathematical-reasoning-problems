    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, we need to perform a series of transformations to remove any rational 2-torsion and 3-torsion points. We will use the standard notation $E: y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6$ for an elliptic curve.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given equation in the standard form:\n\n$E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x \\Rightarrow y^2 = x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x + 0$\n\nNow, we have $a_1 = 0$, $a_2 = 0$, $a_3 = 0$, $a_4 = 2$, and $a_6 = 0$.\n\nStep 1: Remove the 2-torsion points.\n\nSince $a_1 = a_3 = 0$, there are no rational 2-torsion points. So, we don't need to perform any transformations for this step.\n\nStep 2: Remove the 3-torsion points.\n\nWe need to check if there are any rational 3-torsion points. To do this, we can look at the discriminant of the curve, which is given by:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4a_4^3 + 27a_6^2) = -16(4(2)^3 + 27(0)^2) = -512$\n\nSince $\\Delta \\neq 0$, the curve is non-singular, and we can proceed to check for 3-torsion points. We will use the invariant $c_4 = a_4^2 - 8a_6$ and $c_6 = a_4^3 - 36a_4a_6 + 216a_6^2$:\n\n$c_4 = 2^2 - 8(0) = 4$\n\n$c_6 = 2^3 - 36(2)(0) + 216(0)^2 = 8$\n\nNow, we can compute the $j$-invariant of the curve:\n\n$j = 1728\\frac{c_4^3}{c_4^3 - 27c_6^2} = 1728\\frac{4^3}{4^3 - 27(8)^2} = 1728\\frac{64}{64 - 27\\cdot 64} = 1728\\frac{64}{-16\\cdot 64} = -1728$\n\nSince $j = -1728$, the curve has a rational 3-torsion point. To remove it, we can perform a transformation of the form $x = u^2x'$ and $y = u^3y'$, where $u$ is a rational number. We choose $u = 2$:\n\n$x = 2^2x' \\Rightarrow x' = \\frac{x}{4}$\n\n$y = 2^3y' \\Rightarrow y' = \\frac{y}{8}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the original equation, we get:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{y}{8}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right)^3 + 2\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right)$\n\nSimplifying, we obtain the minimal model of the elliptic curve:\n\n$E': y'^2 = x'^3 + 8x'$\n\nThis is the minimal model of the given elliptic curve over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$."
