    "message_2": "To calculate the error of the system after 50 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nerror_final = error_initial * e^(Lyapunov_exponent * iterations)\n\nwhere error_initial is the initial error, Lyapunov_exponent is the given Lyapunov exponent, and iterations is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, error_initial = 0.002, Lyapunov_exponent = 0.6, and iterations = 50.\n\nerror_final = 0.002 * e^(0.6 * 50)\n\nerror_final ≈ 0.002 * e^30\n\nerror_final ≈ 0.002 * 1.06864746 × 10^13\n\nerror_final ≈ 2.13729492 × 10^10\n\nSo, the error of the system after 50 iterations is approximately 2.137 × 10^10."
