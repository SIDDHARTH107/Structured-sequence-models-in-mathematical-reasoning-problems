Let A and B be two non-empty disjoint closed subsets of X. \n\nProve that there exist two disjoint open sets U and V such that A is contained in U and B is contained in V. \n\nHint: Consider the complements of A and B, and use the fact that X is a Hausdorff space.",
    "message_2": "Since A and B are closed subsets of X, their complements, A' and B', are open subsets of X. Now, let a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Since X is a Hausdorff space, there exist open sets U_a and V_b such that a ∈ U_a, b ∈ V_b, and U_a ∩ V_b = ∅.\n\nConsider the collection of open sets {U_a} for all a ∈ A, and {V_b} for all b ∈ B. We will now show that the union of these open sets, U = ⋃_{a ∈ A} U_a and V = ⋃_{b ∈ B} V_b, are disjoint open sets containing A and B, respectively.\n\nFirst, note that U and V are open sets, since they are the union of open sets. Next, we will show that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. For any a ∈ A, there exists an open set U_a containing a such that U_a ⊆ U. Similarly, for any b ∈ B, there exists an open set V_b containing b such that V_b ⊆ V. Therefore, A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nNow, we will show that U ∩ V = ∅. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a point x ∈ U ∩ V. Then, x ∈ U_a for some a ∈ A and x ∈ V_b for some b ∈ B. However, this contradicts the fact that U_a ∩ V_b = ∅ for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Therefore, U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found two disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V, as desired."
