    "message_1": "A coaxial cable with inner radius 1 cm and outer radius 2 cm carries a current of 1 A. Find the amplitude of the electric field at a radius of 3 cm using the Fourier transform method. Assume that the conductivity of the cable is constant and equals to 1 S/m, and the permeability of the surrounding medium is vacuum permeability, µ0 = 4π × 10−7 H/m.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the electric field at a radius of 3 cm using the Fourier transform method, we first need to determine the magnetic field (B) inside and outside the coaxial cable. We can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field.\n\nAmpere's law states that the line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of the medium (µ) and the current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮ B * dl = µ * I_enclosed\n\nFor the coaxial cable, we consider two cases:\n\n1. Inside the cable (r < 2 cm): In this case, the current enclosed by the loop is the total current (1 A).\n\n2. Outside the cable (r > 2 cm): In this case, the current enclosed by the loop is zero, as there is no current outside the cable.\n\nNow, we can find the magnetic field (B) for both cases:\n\n1. Inside the cable (r < 2 cm):\n\nB * 2πr = µ * I_enclosed\nB = (µ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\n2. Outside the cable (r > 2 cm):\n\nB = 0, as there is no current enclosed by the loop.\n\nNext, we need to find the electric field (E) using the Fourier transform method. The relationship between the electric field and the magnetic field is given by:\n\nE = (1/σ) * (∇ × B)\n\nSince the magnetic field is azimuthal (in the φ direction), we can write the curl of B as:\n\n∇ × B = (∂B/∂r) * e_r - (1/r) * (∂(rB)/∂z) * e_φ\n\nNow, we can find the electric field (E) for both cases:\n\n1. Inside the cable (r < 2 cm):\n\nE_r = (1/σ) * (∂B/∂r)\nE_φ = -(1/σ) * (1/r) * (∂(rB)/∂z)\n\n2. Outside the cable (r > 2 cm):\n\nE_r = 0\nE_φ = 0\n\nFinally, we can find the amplitude of the electric field at a radius of 3 cm:\n\nSince r = 3 cm is outside the cable, the electric field is zero:\n\nE_r = 0\nE_φ = 0\n\nSo, the amplitude of the electric field at a radius of 3 cm is 0 V/m."
