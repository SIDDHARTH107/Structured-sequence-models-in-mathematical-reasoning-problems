    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products X and Y using machines A and B, respectively. The production time for product X on machine A is 3 minutes and on machine B is 5 minutes. The production time for product Y on machine A is 2 minutes and on machine B is 4 minutes. The company has 240 minutes of machine A time and 400 minutes of machine B time per day. To maximize the profit, the company wants to decide how many units of each product to produce. The profit for product X is $8 per unit, and the profit for product Y is $11 per unit. Each product requires an integer number of minutes on each machine. What is the maximum profit that can be earned per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced.\n\nThe constraints for the production time on machines A and B can be represented as:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 240 (machine A)\n5x + 4y ≤ 400 (machine B)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 8x + 11y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\nFrom the first constraint (machine A):\n\ny ≤ (240 - 3x) / 2\n\nFrom the second constraint (machine B):\n\ny ≤ (400 - 5x) / 4\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative, we have:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (240 - 3x) / 2: (0, 120)\n3. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (400 - 5x) / 4: (0, 100)\n4. Intersection of y = 0 and x = (240 - 2y) / 3: (80, 0)\n5. Intersection of y = 0 and x = (400 - 4y) / 5: (80, 0)\n6. Intersection of y = (240 - 3x) / 2 and y = (400 - 5x) / 4: (40, 60)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 8(0) + 11(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 120) = 8(0) + 11(120) = $1320\n3. P(0, 100) = 8(0) + 11(100) = $1100\n4. P(80, 0) = 8(80) + 11(0) = $640\n5. P(80, 0) = 8(80) + 11(0) = $640\n6. P(40, 60) = 8(40) + 11(60) = $1460\n\nThe maximum profit is $1460 per day when producing 40 units of product X and 60 units of product Y."
