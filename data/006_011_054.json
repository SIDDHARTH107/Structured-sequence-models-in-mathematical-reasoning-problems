    "message_1": "A company has experienced an average of 3 electrical accidents per month in the past year. Find the probability of having at least 2 electrical accidents in the next month.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, electrical accidents) that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given a fixed average rate of occurrence (λ).\n\nIn this case, the average rate of occurrence (λ) is 3 electrical accidents per month.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (electrical accidents), k is the desired number of events, λ is the average rate of occurrence, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 2 electrical accidents in the next month, which means we need to find the probability of having 2, 3, 4, ... accidents. To do this, we can find the probability of having 0 or 1 accidents and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X=0) = (e^(-3) * 3^0) / 0! = (0.0498 * 1) / 1 = 0.0498\n\nP(X=1) = (e^(-3) * 3^1) / 1! = (0.0498 * 3) / 1 = 0.1494\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 2 accidents:\n\nP(X≥2) = 1 - P(X=0) - P(X=1) = 1 - 0.0498 - 0.1494 = 0.8008\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 2 electrical accidents in the next month is approximately 0.8008 or 80.08%."
