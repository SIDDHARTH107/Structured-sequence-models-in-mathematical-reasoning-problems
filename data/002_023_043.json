    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 4 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (4 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 16 cm^2\nSurface area = 64π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is 64π cm^2, or approximately 201.06 cm^2."
