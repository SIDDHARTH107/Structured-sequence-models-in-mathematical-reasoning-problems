If a sample of 25 batteries is taken, what is the probability that the average weight of the batteries in the sample will be less than 3.9 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean (when the sample size is large enough) will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 4 grams, the population standard deviation (σ) is 0.2 grams, and the sample size (n) is 25.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\nσ_sample_mean = 0.2 / √25\nσ_sample_mean = 0.2 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 0.04 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the sample mean of 3.9 grams:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz = (3.9 - 4) / 0.04\nz = -0.1 / 0.04\nz = -2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.5. We can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the area to the left of the z-score:\n\nP(z < -2.5) ≈ 0.0062\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the batteries in the sample will be less than 3.9 grams is approximately 0.0062 or 0.62%."
