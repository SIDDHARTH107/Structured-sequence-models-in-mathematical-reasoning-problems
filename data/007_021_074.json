    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 379, we can start by testing the smallest prime number, 2, and work our way up. Since 379 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. The next prime number is 3, but 379 is not divisible by 3 either (3 * 126 = 378, and 3 * 127 = 381). The next prime number is 5, but 379 is not divisible by 5 either (5 * 75 = 375, and 5 * 76 = 380). The next prime number is 7, but 379 is not divisible by 7 either (7 * 54 = 378, and 7 * 55 = 385). \n\nSince 11 * 11 = 121, which is smaller than 379, we need to check the divisibility by 11 as well. However, 379 is not divisible by 11 either (11 * 34 = 374, and 11 * 35 = 385). The next prime number is 13, but 379 is not divisible by 13 either (13 * 29 = 377, and 13 * 30 = 390). \n\nSince 17 * 17 = 289, which is smaller than 379, we need to check the divisibility by 17 as well. However, 379 is not divisible by 17 either (17 * 22 = 374, and 17 * 23 = 391). The next prime number is 19, but 379 is not divisible by 19 either (19 * 20 = 380). \n\nSince 23 * 23 = 529, which is larger than 379, we don't need to check any further. Therefore, 379 is a prime number, and its smallest prime factor is itself, 379."
