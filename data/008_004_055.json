    "message_2": "To solve the homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |  0 ]\n[  4  -2   3 |  0 ]\n[ -2   1  -1 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[  1   3/2 -1/2 |  0 ]\n[  4  -2    3  |  0 ]\n[ -2   1   -1  |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Add -4 times the first row to the second row and add 2 times the first row to the third row:\n\n```\n[  1   3/2 -1/2 |  0 ]\n[  0  -5    5  |  0 ]\n[  0   4   -2  |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -5 and the third row by 4:\n\n```\n[  1   3/2 -1/2 |  0 ]\n[  0    1   -1  |  0 ]\n[  0    1  -1/2 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Subtract the second row from the third row and add -3/2 times the second row to the first row:\n\n```\n[  1   0    1  |  0 ]\n[  0   1   -1  |  0 ]\n[  0   0    1/2 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Multiply the third row by 2 and add it to the first and second rows:\n\n```\n[  1   0    0  |  0 ]\n[  0   1    0  |  0 ]\n[  0   0    1  |  0 ]\n```\n\nThe resulting matrix corresponds to the system of equations:\n\n```\nx = 0\ny = 0\nz = 0\n```\n\nSo the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
