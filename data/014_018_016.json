    "message_1": "Let's say you intercepted a message that has been encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, but you don't know the key. If you perform a frequency analysis on the encrypted message, you find that the most frequent letter is \"E\" and it appears 15 times. What is the probability that any randomly selected letter in the original message is also an \"E\"?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that any randomly selected letter in the original message is an \"E\", we need to know the total number of letters in the message. Let's assume the total number of letters in the message is N.\n\nThe frequency of the letter \"E\" in the encrypted message is 15. Since the encryption is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, the frequency of \"E\" in the original message will also be 15.\n\nTherefore, the probability that any randomly selected letter in the original message is an \"E\" can be calculated as:\n\nProbability = (Number of occurrences of \"E\") / (Total number of letters in the message)\nProbability = 15 / N\n\nWithout knowing the value of N, we cannot provide a specific probability."
