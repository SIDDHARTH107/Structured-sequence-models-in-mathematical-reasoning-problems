    "message_1": "In a recent survey conducted in a country, it was found that 40% of the population supports a particular political party. If a random sample of 1000 people from that country is taken, what is the probability that at least 450 people support the same political party?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 0.40)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 1000)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, we want at least 450)\n\nHowever, since we want the probability of at least 450 people supporting the political party, we need to calculate the probability for each value from 450 to 1000 and sum them up. This can be quite tedious, so we can use the complement rule, which states that:\n\nP(X ≥ k) = 1 - P(X < k)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of having less than 450 successes (i.e., 0 to 449) and subtract it from 1.\n\nTo calculate this, we can use a cumulative binomial probability table or a calculator with a binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF). Using a calculator or software with a binomial CDF function, we can find:\n\nP(X < 450) = binomial_cdf(n=1000, p=0.40, k=449)\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule:\n\nP(X ≥ 450) = 1 - P(X < 450)\n\nPlug in the value we found:\n\nP(X ≥ 450) = 1 - binomial_cdf(n=1000, p=0.40, k=449)\n\nThis will give us the probability that at least 450 people in the sample of 1000 support the political party."
