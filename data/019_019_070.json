    "message_2": "Yes, the function f(x) = 2x + 1 is computable by a Turing machine. Here is a step-by-step description of a Turing machine that computes this function:\n\n1. Input: The input x is given in unary representation, i.e., a sequence of x 1's on the tape, followed by a blank symbol (denoted as B). For example, if x = 3, the input on the tape would be 111B.\n\n2. Initialization: The Turing machine starts in the initial state q0 with the tape head positioned on the leftmost 1.\n\n3. Double the input: In state q0, the Turing machine replaces the current 1 with an X (a marker symbol), moves right until it finds a blank symbol, writes a 1, and moves right. Then, it goes back to the left until it finds the X symbol and moves one position to the right. If it reads a 1, it repeats the process. If it reads a blank symbol, it moves to state q1.\n\n4. Add 1 to the result: In state q1, the Turing machine moves right until it finds a blank symbol, writes a 1, and moves to state q2.\n\n5. Clean up: In state q2, the Turing machine moves left until it finds an X symbol, replaces it with a 1, and moves to state q3.\n\n6. Move to the beginning: In state q3, the Turing machine moves left until it finds a blank symbol, and then moves one position to the right. The Turing machine halts, and the result is on the tape in unary representation.\n\nFor example, let's compute f(3) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7 using the Turing machine:\n\nInitial tape: 111B\nStep 1: X11B11B\nStep 2: X11B111B\nStep 3: 1X1B1111B\nStep 4: 1X1B11111B\nStep 5: 11XB11111B\nStep 6: 1111111B (result)\n\nThe Turing machine successfully computes the function f(x) = 2x + 1."
