    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let x be the smallest positive integer that satisfies the conditions.\n\nWe have the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 4 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 5 (mod 9)\n\nWe can rewrite these congruences as:\n\nx = 7a + 4\nx = 9b + 5\n\nWhere a and b are integers.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies both equations. We can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n7a + 4 = 9b + 5\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate a:\n\na = (9b + 1) / 7\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest integer b such that (9b + 1) is divisible by 7. We can test values of b starting from 0:\n\nb = 0: (9 * 0 + 1) / 7 = 1/7 (not an integer)\nb = 1: (9 * 1 + 1) / 7 = 10/7 (not an integer)\nb = 2: (9 * 2 + 1) / 7 = 19/7 (not an integer)\nb = 3: (9 * 3 + 1) / 7 = 28/7 = 4 (integer)\n\nSo, the smallest integer b that satisfies the condition is 3. Now, we can find the corresponding value of a:\n\na = (9 * 3 + 1) / 7 = 28/7 = 4\n\nNow, we can find the smallest positive integer x using either equation:\n\nx = 7a + 4 = 7 * 4 + 4 = 32\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 5 when divided by 9 is 32."
