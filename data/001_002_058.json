    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (-3, 5) and (1, -1) in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), we first need to find the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b).\n\n1. Find the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (-3, 5) and (1, -1), we have:\n\nm = (-1 - 5) / (1 - (-3))\nm = (-6) / (4)\nm = -3/2\n\nSo, the slope (m) is -3/2.\n\n2. Find the y-intercept (b) using the slope and one of the points:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nWe can use the point (-3, 5) and the slope -3/2:\n\n5 = (-3/2)(-3) + b\n5 = 9/2 + b\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\nb = 5 - 9/2\nb = (10 - 9) / 2\nb = 1/2\n\nSo, the y-intercept (b) is 1/2.\n\n3. Write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:\n\ny = mx + b\ny = -3/2x + 1/2"
