    "message_2": "To show that the two curves C1 and C2 are birationally equivalent, we need to find a rational map between them. A rational map is a pair of rational functions (f(x, y), g(x, y)) such that applying the map to a point on one curve gives a point on the other curve.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equations of the curves in a more convenient form:\n\nC1: (x + 1)^2 + (y - 3/2)^2 = 5/4\nC2: y(2x - 1) = x + 1\n\nNow, let's find a rational map from C1 to C2. We can start by parameterizing C1 using a rational parametrization of a circle. Let t be a rational parameter, and let:\n\nx = 1 - (5/4)sin(2t) / (1 + cos(2t))\ny = 3/2 + (5/4)cos(2t) / (1 + cos(2t))\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for x and y into the equation for C2:\n\n(3/2 + (5/4)cos(2t) / (1 + cos(2t)))(2(1 - (5/4)sin(2t) / (1 + cos(2t))) - 1) = 1 - (5/4)sin(2t) / (1 + cos(2t)) + 1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(3/2 + (5/4)cos(2t))(1 - (5/4)sin(2t)) = (1 + cos(2t))^2\n\nThis equation holds true for all values of t, so the rational map (f(t), g(t)) = (1 - (5/4)sin(2t) / (1 + cos(2t)), 3/2 + (5/4)cos(2t) / (1 + cos(2t))) maps points on C1 to points on C2.\n\nNow we need to find a rational map from C2 to C1. We can start by solving the equation of C2 for y:\n\ny = (x + 1) / (2x - 1)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the equation for C1:\n\n(x + 1)^2 + ((x + 1) / (2x - 1) - 3/2)^2 = 5/4\n\nSolving this equation for x, we get:\n\nx = (5/4 - 1) / (1 - (5/4 - 1)(2 - 1)) = 1/4\n\nNow, substitute this value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (1/4 + 1) / (2(1/4) - 1) = 5/4\n\nSo, the rational map (h(x, y), k(x, y)) = (1/4, 5/4) maps points on C2 to points on C1.\n\nTherefore, the two curves C1 and C2 are birationally equivalent, with the rational maps (f(t), g(t)) and (h(x, y), k(x, y)) providing the correspondence between points on the two curves."
