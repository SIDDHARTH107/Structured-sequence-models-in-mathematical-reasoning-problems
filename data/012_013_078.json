    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph is a polynomial that counts the number of proper colorings of the graph using a given number of colors. For a complete graph K_n with n vertices, the chromatic polynomial can be expressed as:\n\nP(K_n, k) = k(k-1)^{n-1}\n\nIn the case of K5, where n = 5, the chromatic polynomial is:\n\nP(K_5, k) = k(k-1)^4"
