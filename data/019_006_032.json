    "message_2": "Let's use the following notation:\n\nP(W) = Probability that John will go to work today\nP(R) = Probability that it will rain today (0.4)\n\nSince John cannot go to work if it rains, we need to find the probability that it will not rain today. The probability of not raining is given by:\n\nP(not R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6\n\nNow, since John must go to work today if it doesn't rain, the probability that John will go to work today is equal to the probability that it will not rain today:\n\nP(W) = P(not R) = 0.6\n\nSo, the probability that John will go to work today is 0.6 or 60%."
