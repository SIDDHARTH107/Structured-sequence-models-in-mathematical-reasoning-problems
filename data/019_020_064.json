    "message_2": "To determine the largest input size that can be solved within 10 seconds, we need to find the maximum value of n for which the running time of the algorithm is less than or equal to 10 seconds. In other words, we need to find the largest n such that:\n\n5n^3 + 2^n <= 10 seconds\n\nThis equation is not easily solvable using algebraic methods, so we can use trial and error to find the largest value of n that satisfies the inequality.\n\nStarting with n = 1:\n5(1)^3 + 2^1 = 5 + 2 = 7 <= 10 (True)\n\nTrying n = 2:\n5(2)^3 + 2^2 = 40 + 4 = 44 <= 10 (False)\n\nSince the running time for n = 2 exceeds 10 seconds, the largest input size that can be solved within 10 seconds is n = 1."
