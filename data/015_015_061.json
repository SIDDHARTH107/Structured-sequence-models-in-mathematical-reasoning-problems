    "message_2": "The Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is a complex oscillatory chemical reaction that exhibits nonlinear dynamics. The number of equilibrium points in the BZ reaction depends on the specific parameters of the reaction, such as the concentrations of the reactants and the temperature.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of equilibrium points for a given set of parameters, one needs to analyze the system's phase portrait, which is a graphical representation of the trajectories of the system in the phase space. The equilibrium points correspond to the stable and unstable fixed points in the phase portrait.\n\nIn general, the BZ reaction can have multiple equilibrium points depending on the parameters. However, it is difficult to provide an exact maximum number without knowing the specific parameter values. In some cases, the BZ reaction can have one or two stable equilibrium points, while in other cases, it can exhibit more complex behavior with multiple stable and unstable equilibrium points.\n\nIn summary, the maximum number of equilibrium points for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction depends on the specific parameters of the reaction, and can be determined by analyzing the system's phase portrait."
