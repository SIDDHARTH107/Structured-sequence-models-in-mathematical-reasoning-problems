    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize their profits by determining the optimal production levels for two products - Product A and Product B. The company can produce up to 400 units of Product A and 500 units of Product B. The total production time available is 8 hours, and Product A takes 2 hours to produce while Product B takes 1 hour to produce. The profit per unit of Product A is $10 while the profit per unit of Product B is $8. What is the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. The company can produce up to 400 units of Product A: x ≤ 400\n2. The company can produce up to 500 units of Product B: y ≤ 500\n3. The total production time available is 8 hours: 2x + y ≤ 8 * 60 (since Product A takes 2 hours to produce and Product B takes 1 hour to produce, we multiply 8 by 60 to convert hours to minutes)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 8y\n\nWe can now solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method or graphical method. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 400\n2. y ≤ 500\n3. 2x + y ≤ 480\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 480), (240, 0), and (200, 80).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 480) = 10(0) + 8(480) = $3,840\n3. Profit at (240, 0) = 10(240) + 8(0) = $2,400\n4. Profit at (200, 80) = 10(200) + 8(80) = $2,000 + $640 = $2,640\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (0, 480), where the company produces 0 units of Product A and 480 units of Product B. The maximum profit is $3,840."
