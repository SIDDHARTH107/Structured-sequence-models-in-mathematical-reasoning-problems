    "message_1": "A flagpole at the top of a building casts a shadow 25 meters long. At the same time, the building casts a shadow 12 meters long. If the angle of elevation from the tip of the shadow to the top of the flagpole is 62 degrees, find the height of the flagpole to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the flagpole as F, the height of the building as B, and the distance from the tip of the flagpole's shadow to the base of the building as x. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the heights and distances.\n\ntan(62°) = (B + F) / x\ntan(62°) = (B + F) / 25\n\nWe can also use the similar triangles formed by the building's shadow and the flagpole's shadow to relate the heights and distances.\n\nB / 12 = F / (25 - 12)\nB / 12 = F / 13\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (B and F). We can solve for B in the second equation and substitute it into the first equation.\n\nB = 12F / 13\n\nSubstitute B into the first equation:\n\ntan(62°) = (12F / 13 + F) / 25\n\nNow, we can solve for F:\n\n25 * tan(62°) = 12F / 13 + F\n25 * tan(62°) = (12F + 13F) / 13\n25 * tan(62°) = 25F / 13\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and solve for F:\n\n25 * 13 * tan(62°) = 25F\nF = 13 * tan(62°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of tan(62°) and find the height of the flagpole:\n\nF ≈ 13 * 1.8807\nF ≈ 24.4491\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the flagpole is approximately 24 meters."
