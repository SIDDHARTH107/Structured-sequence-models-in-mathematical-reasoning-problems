The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\n\nSo, for A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}, we have:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find B × A:\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nComparing the two sets A × B and B × A, we can see that they are not equal:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nThe ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are different, so A × B is not equal to B × A."
