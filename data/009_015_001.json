    "message_2": "To find the amount of radioactive material remaining after 60 years, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 200 grams, the half-life is 20 years, and the time elapsed is 60 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/2)^(60 / 20)\n\nFirst, we need to find the exponent:\n\n60 / 20 = 3\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the formula:\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/2)^3\n\nNext, we need to calculate (1/2)^3:\n\n(1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nFinally, we can multiply the initial amount by this fraction:\n\nFinal amount = 200 * 1/8\nFinal amount = 200 / 8\nFinal amount = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 60 years, there will be 25 grams of the radioactive material remaining."
