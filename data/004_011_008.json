    "message_1": "A rectangular water tank is being filled with water at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. The tank is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. At what rate is the water level rising when the water is 3 feet deep?",
    "message_2": "To find the rate at which the water level is rising, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = lwh, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth) of the tank.\n\nIn this case, the volume of the water in the tank is V = 6 * 4 * h, where h is the height of the water.\n\nThe rate at which the volume of the water is increasing is 2 cubic feet per minute. We can represent this as dV/dt = 2, where dV/dt is the rate of change of the volume with respect to time.\n\nNow, we can differentiate the volume equation with respect to time:\n\ndV/dt = d(6 * 4 * h)/dt\n\nSince the length and width of the tank are constants, we can treat them as constants when differentiating:\n\n2 = 6 * 4 * dh/dt\n\nNow, we can solve for dh/dt, the rate at which the water level is rising:\n\ndh/dt = 2 / (6 * 4)\n\ndh/dt = 1/12 feet per minute\n\nNow, we need to find the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 3 feet deep. Since the rate of change of the height is constant, the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 3 feet deep is also 1/12 feet per minute."
