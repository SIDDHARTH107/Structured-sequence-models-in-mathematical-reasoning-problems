    "message_1": "What is the time complexity of the following algorithm that finds the maximum element in an array of n integers:\n\n```\nmax_element = array[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n  if array[i] > max_element:\n    max_element = array[i]\n```\n\nAssume that each operation inside the for loop takes a constant amount of time.",
    "message_2": "The time complexity of the given algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm iterates through the entire array once, comparing each element to the current maximum element. Since each operation inside the for loop takes a constant amount of time, the overall complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array."
