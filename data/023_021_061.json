    "message_2": "For a periodic signal with period T, the Fourier series representation is given by:\n\nf(t) = Σ [cn * exp(j * n * ω0 * t)]\n\nwhere ω0 = 2π/T, n is an integer, and cn are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nGiven the Fourier coefficients:\n\nc0 = 1\nc1 = -2-j\nc2 = 2\nc-2 = 1+j\n\nThe Fourier series representation of the signal f(t) can be written as:\n\nf(t) = 1 - (2+j) * exp(j * ω0 * t) + 2 * exp(2j * ω0 * t) + (1+j) * exp(-2j * ω0 * t)\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transformation F(ω) of the signal f(t). Since f(t) is a periodic signal, its Fourier transform will be a series of impulses in the frequency domain. The amplitudes of these impulses are given by the Fourier coefficients cn, and they are located at the frequencies n * ω0.\n\nω0 = 2π/T = 2π/20 = π/10\n\nSo, the Fourier transformation F(ω) can be represented as:\n\nF(ω) = 1 * δ(ω) - (2+j) * δ(ω - ω0) + 2 * δ(ω - 2ω0) + (1+j) * δ(ω + 2ω0)\n\nNow, let's plot the magnitude and phase spectra of F(ω).\n\nThe magnitude spectrum is given by the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients:\n\n|c0| = 1\n|c1| = |-2-j| = √((-2)^2 + (-1)^2) = √5\n|c2| = 2\n|c-2| = |1+j| = √(1^2 + 1^2) = √2\n\nThe phase spectrum is given by the angles of the Fourier coefficients:\n\n∠c0 = 0° (since c0 is a real positive number)\n∠c1 = arctan(Im(c1)/Re(c1)) = arctan(-1/-2) = arctan(1/2) = 26.57°\n∠c2 = 0° (since c2 is a real positive number)\n∠c-2 = arctan(Im(c-2)/Re(c-2)) = arctan(1/1) = arctan(1) = 45°\n\nTo plot the magnitude and phase spectra, you can create a stem plot with the following values:\n\nMagnitude spectrum:\nx-axis: -2ω0, -ω0, 0, ω0, 2ω0\ny-axis: √2, √5, 1, √5, 2\n\nPhase spectrum:\nx-axis: -2ω0, -ω0, 0, ω0, 2ω0\ny-axis: 45°, 26.57°, 0°, -26.57°, 0°"
