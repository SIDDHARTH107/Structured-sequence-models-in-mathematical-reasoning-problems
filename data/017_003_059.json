    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 7 is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince the order of G is 7, which is a prime number, we can apply Lagrange's theorem. Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup H of a finite group G must divide the order of G. In our case, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and 7, since 7 is prime.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G, where g is not the identity element. The subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>, consists of all the powers of g: {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^n}, where n is the smallest positive integer such that g^n is the identity element.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of <g> must divide the order of G, which is 7. Since the only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, the order of <g> must be either 1 or 7. However, the order of <g> cannot be 1, as this would imply that g is the identity element, which we have excluded. Therefore, the order of <g> must be 7.\n\nSince the order of <g> is 7, it means that <g> contains all 7 elements of G. Thus, every element in G can be expressed as a power of g, and G is a cyclic group generated by g."
