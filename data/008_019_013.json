    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of equations:\n\n(1) x - 2y + 3z = 4 + 2i\n(2) 2x + y + 4z = 3 - i\n(3) 3x + y + (2 + i)z = 7 - 3i\n\nWe will eliminate y from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (2) by -1 and add it to equation (3):\n\n-1 * (2x + y + 4z = 3 - i)\n-2x - y - 4z = -3 + i\n\nNow, add this result to equation (3):\n\n(-2x - y - 4z) + (3x + y + (2 + i)z) = (-3 + i) + (7 - 3i)\nx - 4z + (2 + i)z = 4 - 2i\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\nx + (-2 + i)z = 4 - 2i  (4)\n\nNow, we will eliminate y from equations (1) and (2). To do this, we will multiply equation (1) by 2 and add it to equation (2):\n\n2 * (x - 2y + 3z = 4 + 2i)\n2x - 4y + 6z = 8 + 4i\n\nNow, add this result to equation (2):\n\n(2x - 4y + 6z) + (2x + y + 4z) = (8 + 4i) + (3 - i)\n4x + 10z = 11 + 3i  (5)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\n(4) x + (-2 + i)z = 4 - 2i\n(5) 4x + 10z = 11 + 3i\n\nWe will eliminate x from equations (4) and (5). To do this, we will multiply equation (4) by -4 and add it to equation (5):\n\n-4 * (x + (-2 + i)z = 4 - 2i)\n-4x - (-8 + 4i)z = -16 + 8i\n\nNow, add this result to equation (5):\n\n(-4x - (-8 + 4i)z) + (4x + 10z) = (-16 + 8i) + (11 + 3i)\n(4i)z = -5 + 11i\n\nNow, let's solve for z:\n\nz = (-5 + 11i) / (4i)\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is -4i:\n\nz = (-5 + 11i) * (-4i) / (4i * -4i)\nz = (22 - 44i) / 16\nz = 11/8 - 11/4i\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into equation (4) to find x:\n\nx + (-2 + i)(11/8 - 11/4i) = 4 - 2i\nx + (-22/8 + 11/2i + 11/8i - 11/4) = 4 - 2i\nx - 11/4 + 11/8i = 4 - 2i\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nx = 4 - 2i + 11/4 - 11/8i\nx = (16 + 11)/4 - (2 + 11/8)i\nx = 27/4 - 27/8i\n\nNow, we can substitute x and z back into equation (1) to find y:\n\n27/4 - 27/8i - 2y + 3(11/8 - 11/4i) = 4 + 2i\n27/4 - 27/8i - 2y + 33/8 - 33/4i = 4 + 2i\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\n-2y = 4 + 2i - 27/4 + 27/8i - 33/8 + 33/4i\n-2y = (1/4) + (27/8 + 33/4)i\ny = (-1/8) - (27/16 + 33/8)i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 27/4 - 27/8i\ny = -1/8 - (27/16 + 33/8)i\nz = 11/8 - 11/4i"
