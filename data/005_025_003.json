    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence), σ is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nx̄ = 45 grams (sample mean weight)\nσ = 5 grams (sample standard deviation)\nn = 100 birds (sample size)\nZ = 1.96 (Z-score for 95% confidence)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 45 ± (1.96 * (5 / √100))\n\nCI = 45 ± (1.96 * (5 / 10))\n\nCI = 45 ± (1.96 * 0.5)\n\nCI = 45 ± 0.98\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight is (44.02, 45.98) grams."
