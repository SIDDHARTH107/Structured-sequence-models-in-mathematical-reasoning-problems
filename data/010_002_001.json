    "message_2": "To determine whether the function f(x) = 1/x is continuous, we need to show that for every open set V in Y, the preimage f^(-1)(V) is an open set in X.\n\nLet V be an open set in Y, i.e., an open interval in [0, ∞). Since f(x) = 1/x is a strictly decreasing function on the interval (0, 1), the preimage of an open interval in Y will be an open interval in X. Let's see this more formally.\n\nLet y ∈ V, where V is an open interval in Y. Then, there exists an open interval (a, b) in Y such that y ∈ (a, b) ⊆ V. Let x = f^(-1)(y), so f(x) = y. Then, x = 1/y.\n\nNow, we have a < y < b, which implies 1/b < 1/y < 1/a. Since f(x) = 1/x is strictly decreasing on (0, 1), we have 1/b < x < 1/a. Thus, x ∈ (1/b, 1/a), and (1/b, 1/a) is an open interval in X.\n\nSince f^(-1)(y) = x, we have f^(-1)((a, b)) = (1/b, 1/a). This shows that the preimage of an open interval in Y is an open interval in X.\n\nTherefore, the function f(x) = 1/x is continuous on the given topological spaces X and Y."
