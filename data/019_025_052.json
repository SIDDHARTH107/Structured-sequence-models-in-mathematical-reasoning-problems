    "message_1": "Suppose that a factory produces 500 units of a certain product in 8 hours, but due to an increase in machine speed, it can now produce 750 units in the same time. What is the percentage increase in production per hour?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the production rate per hour before and after the increase in machine speed.\n\nBefore the increase:\n500 units / 8 hours = 62.5 units per hour\n\nAfter the increase:\n750 units / 8 hours = 93.75 units per hour\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage increase in production per hour:\n\n(93.75 - 62.5) / 62.5 = 0.5\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.5 * 100 = 50%\n\nSo, there is a 50% increase in production per hour."
