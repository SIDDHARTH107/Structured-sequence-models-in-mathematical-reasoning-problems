    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function y(x) is given by:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[y(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(x), and ω is the angular frequency. \n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0, we get:\n\nFT(y'') + 4 * FT(y) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transforms of y'' and y. We know that the Fourier transform of a derivative is given by:\n\nFT(y'(x)) = iω * Y(ω)\n\nFT(y''(x)) = (iω)^2 * Y(ω) = -ω^2 * Y(ω)\n\nSubstituting these into the transformed differential equation, we get:\n\n-ω^2 * Y(ω) + 4 * Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) * (-ω^2 + 4) = 0\n\nSince Y(ω) ≠ 0, we have:\n\n-ω^2 + 4 = 0\n\nω^2 = 4\n\nω = ±2\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get the solution y(x):\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[Y(ω) * e^(iωx)] dω\n\nSince we have two values for ω, the solution will be a linear combination of the two corresponding exponential functions:\n\ny(x) = A * e^(2ix) + B * e^(-2ix)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the given initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 2\ny'(0) = 3\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = A * e^(0) + B * e^(0) = A + B\n2 = A + B\n\ny'(x) = 2iA * e^(2ix) - 2iB * e^(-2ix)\n\ny'(0) = 2iA * e^(0) - 2iB * e^(0) = 2iA - 2iB\n3 = 2iA - 2iB\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\nA + B = 2\n2iA - 2iB = 3\n\nSolving for A and B:\n\nA = (2 + 3i)/4\nB = (2 - 3i)/4\n\nFinally, substituting the values of A and B back into the solution:\n\ny(x) = (2 + 3i)/4 * e^(2ix) + (2 - 3i)/4 * e^(-2ix)\n\nThis is the solution to the given differential equation with the specified initial conditions."
