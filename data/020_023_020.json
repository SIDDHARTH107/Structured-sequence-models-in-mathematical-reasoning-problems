    "message_1": "Suppose you have $100,000 to invest in a stock market. You want to create a portfolio of two stocks, Stock A and Stock B. The expected returns on Stock A and Stock B are 12% and 8%, respectively. The standard deviation of returns on Stock A and Stock B are 20% and 10%, respectively. The correlation between the returns on Stock A and Stock B is 0.6. Determine the optimal portfolio allocation between these two stocks that will minimize the portfolio risk.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal portfolio allocation between Stock A and Stock B that will minimize the portfolio risk, we need to calculate the portfolio weights that minimize the portfolio variance. Let's denote the weight of Stock A as wA and the weight of Stock B as wB. Since we are investing the entire amount in these two stocks, wA + wB = 1.\n\nThe portfolio variance (σP^2) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσP^2 = (wA * σA)^2 + (wB * σB)^2 + 2 * wA * wB * σA * σB * ρAB\n\nwhere σA and σB are the standard deviations of Stock A and Stock B, respectively, and ρAB is the correlation between the returns on Stock A and Stock B.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\nσP^2 = (wA * 0.20)^2 + ((1 - wA) * 0.10)^2 + 2 * wA * (1 - wA) * 0.20 * 0.10 * 0.6\n\nTo minimize the portfolio variance, we need to find the value of wA that minimizes σP^2. To do this, we can take the derivative of σP^2 with respect to wA and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(σP^2) / dwA = 0\n\nSolve for wA:\n\n0 = 2 * (0.20^2) * wA - 2 * (0.10^2) * wA + 2 * 0.20 * 0.10 * 0.6 - 2 * 0.20 * 0.10 * 0.6 * wA\n\n0 = (0.08 - 0.02) * wA + 0.012 - 0.012 * wA\n\n0.012 = 0.06 * wA\n\nwA = 0.012 / 0.06 = 0.2\n\nNow, we can find the weight of Stock B:\n\nwB = 1 - wA = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n\nSo, the optimal portfolio allocation that minimizes the portfolio risk is 20% in Stock A and 80% in Stock B. In terms of the initial investment of $100,000, this means investing $20,000 in Stock A and $80,000 in Stock B."
