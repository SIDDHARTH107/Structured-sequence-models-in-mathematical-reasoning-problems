    "message_2": "Since $E$ is isomorphic to its dual, we have $E \\cong E^*$. Let's denote the isomorphism by $\\phi: E \\to E^*$. Now, consider the determinant line bundle $\\text{det}(E)$, which is defined as the top exterior power of $E$, i.e., $\\text{det}(E) = \\bigwedge^3 E$. \n\nUsing the isomorphism $\\phi$, we can relate the determinant line bundle of $E$ to that of $E^*$:\n$$\\text{det}(E^*) = \\bigwedge^3 E^* \\cong \\bigwedge^3 \\phi(E) = \\phi(\\bigwedge^3 E) = \\phi(\\text{det}(E)).$$\n\nSince $\\text{det}(E)$ and $\\text{det}(E^*)$ are isomorphic, their first Stiefel-Whitney classes must be equal, i.e., $w_1(\\text{det}(E)) = w_1(\\text{det}(E^*))$. \n\nNow, we use the fact that the first Stiefel-Whitney class of a dual bundle is the negative of the original bundle's first Stiefel-Whitney class, i.e., $w_1(E^*) = -w_1(E)$. Therefore, we have:\n$$w_1(\\text{det}(E)) = -w_1(E).$$\n\nRecall that the first Stiefel-Whitney class of the determinant line bundle is the mod 2 reduction of the Euler characteristic of the base space, i.e., $w_1(\\text{det}(E)) = \\chi(X) \\pmod{2}$. Since the Euler characteristic of $E$ is given as $6$, we have:\n$$w_1(\\text{det}(E)) = 6 \\pmod{2} = 0.$$\n\nFinally, combining the equations, we get:\n$$0 = w_1(\\text{det}(E)) = -w_1(E).$$\n\nThus, the first Stiefel-Whitney class of the bundle $E$ is $w_1(E) = 0$."
