    "message_2": "If the probability of the stock price changing is 0.35, then the probability of it not changing is the complement of this probability. To find the complement, subtract the given probability from 1:\n\n1 - 0.35 = 0.65\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will not change is 0.65 or 65%."
