    "message_1": "A boat is moving at a constant speed of 10 meters per second, and its direction is towards a lighthouse. The angle between the boat's heading and the lighthouse is 30 degrees. Determine the distance between the boat and the lighthouse if the boat is 50 meters away from the lighthouse.",
    "message_2": "The problem statement seems to have a contradiction. It states that the boat is moving towards the lighthouse, but also that the boat is 50 meters away from the lighthouse. I will assume that the boat is 50 meters away from the point on the shore closest to the lighthouse, and the angle between the boat's heading and the lighthouse is 30 degrees. \n\nIn this case, we can use the sine rule to find the distance between the boat and the lighthouse. Let's denote the distance between the boat and the lighthouse as d, the distance between the boat and the point on the shore closest to the lighthouse as a (50 meters), and the angle between the boat's heading and the lighthouse as A (30 degrees).\n\nWe can form a right triangle with the boat, the lighthouse, and the point on the shore closest to the lighthouse. The angle between the boat's heading and the lighthouse (A) is opposite to the side a (50 meters), and the angle opposite to the side d (the distance between the boat and the lighthouse) is 90 degrees (since it's a right triangle).\n\nUsing the sine rule, we have:\n\nd / sin(90) = a / sin(A)\n\nSince sin(90) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nd = a / sin(A)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for a and A:\n\nd = 50 / sin(30)\n\nSince sin(30) = 0.5, we have:\n\nd = 50 / 0.5\n\nd = 100 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the boat and the lighthouse is 100 meters."
