Define a birational transformation \\phi:X\\dashrightarrow Y to be a dominant rational map to a normal variety Y such that \\phi^{-1} is also a dominant rational map. Suppose X is a smooth projective surface over k and \\phi:X\\dashrightarrow Y is a birational transformation from X to a smooth projective surface Y over k. Show that there exists a sequences of blow-ups of points on X and Y such that the minimal model of X is isomorphic to the minimal model of Y. Determine the number of blow-ups required in this sequence.",
    "message_2": "Since X and Y are smooth projective surfaces and \\phi is a birational transformation, there exists a common resolution Z of X and Y, which can be obtained by a sequence of blow-ups of points on X and Y. Let \\pi_X: Z \\to X and \\pi_Y: Z \\to Y be the corresponding birational morphisms. The minimal model of a smooth projective surface is obtained by contracting the (-1)-curves, i.e., the curves with self-intersection -1.\n\nLet's denote by X' and Y' the minimal models of X and Y, respectively. We will show that X' and Y' are isomorphic by constructing an isomorphism between them.\n\nConsider the set of (-1)-curves in Z that are contracted by \\pi_X. Let's denote this set by E_X. Similarly, let E_Y be the set of (-1)-curves in Z that are contracted by \\pi_Y. Since Z is a common resolution of X and Y, we have E_X \\cap E_Y = \\emptyset.\n\nNow, let's contract the (-1)-curves in E_X and E_Y separately. Denote the resulting surfaces by Z_X and Z_Y, respectively. We have two birational morphisms \\rho_X: Z_X \\to X' and \\rho_Y: Z_Y \\to Y' that contract the remaining (-1)-curves in Z_X and Z_Y, respectively.\n\nWe claim that there exists an isomorphism \\psi: Z_X \\to Z_Y such that \\rho_Y \\circ \\psi = \\rho_X. To see this, note that the exceptional divisors of \\pi_X and \\pi_Y are disjoint, so we can define a morphism \\psi: Z_X \\to Z_Y by sending a point p \\in Z_X to the unique point q \\in Z_Y such that \\pi_X(p) = \\pi_Y(q). Since \\pi_X and \\pi_Y are birational, this map is well-defined and bijective. Moreover, it is biregular outside the exceptional divisors, so it is an isomorphism.\n\nNow, we have the following commutative diagram:\n\n```\nZ_X --(psi)--> Z_Y\n |             |\n(rho_X)        (rho_Y)\n |             |\n v             v\nX' <----------> Y'\n```\n\nSince \\psi is an isomorphism, it follows that X' and Y' are isomorphic.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of blow-ups required in the sequence. Let n_X and n_Y be the number of blow-ups required to obtain Z from X and Y, respectively. Then, the number of blow-ups required in the sequence is the maximum of n_X and n_Y, i.e., max(n_X, n_Y). This is because the blow-ups can be performed independently on X and Y, and the common resolution Z can be obtained by performing the necessary blow-ups on both surfaces."
