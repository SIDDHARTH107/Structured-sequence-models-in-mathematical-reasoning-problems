    "message_1": "A company has measured the weights of 100 of its products and found that the mean weight is 500 grams with a standard deviation of 50 grams. Using bootstrapping, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the products.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the products using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the original sample of 100 product weights with a mean of 500 grams and a standard deviation of 50 grams.\n\n2. Resample the data with replacement (i.e., randomly draw 100 product weights from the original sample, allowing for the same weight to be drawn multiple times) to create a new bootstrap sample.\n\n3. Calculate the mean weight of the bootstrap sample.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a large number of times (e.g., 10,000 times) to create a distribution of bootstrap sample means.\n\n5. Determine the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile of the distribution of bootstrap sample means. These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the products.\n\nNote that the actual bootstrapping process requires computational power and cannot be done by hand. However, the concept is illustrated in the steps above."
