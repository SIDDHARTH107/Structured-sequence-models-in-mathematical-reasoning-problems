    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to draw a graph with 8 vertices and the given degree sequence {3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1}. Here is a description of the graph unique up to isomorphism:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n2. Assign the degrees as follows: deg(A) = 3, deg(B) = 3, deg(C) = 3, deg(D) = 2, deg(E) = 2, deg(F) = 1, deg(G) = 1, and deg(H) = 1.\n3. Connect the vertices with the following edges: AB, AC, AD, BC, BE, CD, CF, and GH.\n\nThe resulting graph has the desired degree sequence and can be drawn as follows:\n\n```\n  A---B\n / \\ / \\\nC---D---E\n \\ / \\ /\n  F   G-H\n```\n\nThis graph is unique up to isomorphism, meaning that any other graph with the same degree sequence can be transformed into this graph by relabeling the vertices."
