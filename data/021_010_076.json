    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: product A and product B. The profit on each unit of product A is $10 and on each unit of product B is $15. The factory has a maximum of 500 machine hours available each week. Each unit of product A requires 2 machine hours, while each unit of product B requires 3 machine hours. How many units of each product should the factory produce each week to maximize profit? Use Newton's method to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of product A and product B to produce. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function P(x, y) can be written as:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nThe constraint for the machine hours is:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 500\n\nWe can rewrite the constraint as:\n\ny ≤ (500 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum of the profit function P(x, y) subject to the constraint y ≤ (500 - 2x) / 3. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function L(x, y, λ) as:\n\nL(x, y, λ) = 10x + 15y + λ(500 - 2x - 3y)\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of L(x, y, λ) by taking the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and λ, and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 10 - 2λ = 0\n∂L/∂y = 15 - 3λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 500 - 2x - 3y = 0\n\nSolving the first two equations for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 5\nλ = 5\n\nSince both equations give the same value for λ, we can use either equation to find the optimal values for x and y. Using the third equation:\n\n500 - 2x - 3y = 0\n\nSubstitute λ = 5 into the first equation:\n\n10 - 2(5) = 0\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nNow, substitute λ = 5 into the second equation:\n\n15 - 3(5) = 0\n3y = 15\ny = 5\n\nSo, the factory should produce 5 units of product A and 5 units of product B each week to maximize profit. The maximum profit will be:\n\nP(5, 5) = 10(5) + 15(5) = 50 + 75 = $125"
