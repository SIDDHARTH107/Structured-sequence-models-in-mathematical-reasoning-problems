    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nχ(K) = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 5, E = 8, and F = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nχ(K) = 5 - 8 + 4\n\nχ(K) = 1\n\nSo the Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex K is 1."
