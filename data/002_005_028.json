    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has length 10cm, width 4cm, and height 6cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h):\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we can plug in the values:\n\nd^2 = (10cm)^2 + (4cm)^2 + (6cm)^2\nd^2 = 100cm^2 + 16cm^2 + 36cm^2\nd^2 = 152cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the length of the diagonal by taking the square root of both sides:\n\nd = √(152cm^2)\nd ≈ 12.33cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 12.33cm."
