    "message_2": "First, let's solve the system of equations using the method of least squares. We can rewrite the system of equations in matrix form as follows:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 3  2 -5 |\n    | 2 -1  3 |\n    | 1  2  1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 17 |\n    | -2 |\n    |  8 |\n\nTo solve for X using the method of least squares, we can use the following formula:\n\nX = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * B\n\nwhere A^T is the transpose of matrix A and (A^T * A)^(-1) is the inverse of the matrix product A^T * A.\n\nFirst, let's find A^T:\n\nA^T = |  3  2  1 |\n      |  2 -1  2 |\n      | -5  3  1 |\n\nNext, let's find the product A^T * A:\n\nA^T * A = |  14   -1  -12 |\n          |  -1    6    1 |\n          | -12    1   35 |\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of A^T * A:\n\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = |  0.102  0.014  0.034 |\n                 |  0.014  0.167 -0.003 |\n                 |  0.034 -0.003  0.029 |\n\nNext, let's find the product A^T * B:\n\nA^T * B = |  19 |\n          | -10 |\n          |  66 |\n\nFinally, let's find X:\n\nX = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * B = |  1.000 |\n                                |  2.000 |\n                                | -1.000 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = -1.\n\nNow, let's estimate the uncertainty of the solution. We can use the following formula:\n\nΔX = sqrt(Σ(ΔA_i * X_i)^2)\n\nwhere ΔA_i is the standard deviation of the coefficients and X_i is the corresponding element in the solution vector X.\n\nFor x:\n\nΔx = sqrt((0.1 * 1)^2 + (0.05 * 2)^2 + (0.2 * -5)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.01 + 1) = sqrt(1.02) ≈ 1.01\n\nFor y:\n\nΔy = sqrt((0.05 * 2)^2 + (0.02 * -1)^2 + (0.05 * 2)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.0004 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.0204) ≈ 0.143\n\nFor z:\n\nΔz = sqrt((0.03 * 1)^2 + (0.05 * 2)^2 + (0.1 * 1)^2) = sqrt(0.0009 + 0.01 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.0209) ≈ 0.145\n\nSo, the estimated uncertainties for the solution are Δx ≈ 1.01, Δy ≈ 0.143, and Δz ≈ 0.145."
