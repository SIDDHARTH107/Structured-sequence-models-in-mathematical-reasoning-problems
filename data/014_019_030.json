    "message_1": "An encrypted message was created using a transposition cipher. The original message was 60 characters long and the encrypted message is also 60 characters long. The encryption was done by arranging the characters in a 6x10 grid and reading them off in columns from left to right. What is the decryption key to recover the original message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, you need to reverse the process of the transposition cipher. Since the encryption was done by arranging the characters in a 6x10 grid and reading them off in columns from left to right, you need to arrange the encrypted message in a 10x6 grid and read the characters off in rows from top to bottom.\n\nHere's the decryption process:\n\n1. Write the encrypted message in a 10x6 grid, filling the characters row by row from left to right.\n2. Read the characters column by column from left to right.\n\nThe decryption key is essentially the 10x6 grid arrangement and the process of reading the characters column by column."
