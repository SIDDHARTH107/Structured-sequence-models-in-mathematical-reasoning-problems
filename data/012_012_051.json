    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle. To determine the girth of G, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * E / V + 1\n\nwhere E is the number of edges, V is the number of vertices, and girth(G) is the girth of the graph G.\n\nIn this case, we have E = 12 and V = 8. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 12 / 8 + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 3 + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 4\n\nSince the girth of a graph must be an integer, the possible values for the girth of G are 3 or 4. However, we know that a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges cannot be a tree (which would have a girth of infinity), so the girth of G must be at least 3.\n\nTherefore, the girth of G is 3."
