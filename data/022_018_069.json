    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations for this PDE are:\n\ndx/dt = 1, dy/dt = i, and du/dt = 5.\n\nNow, we can solve these ODEs:\n\n1. dx/dt = 1 => dx = dt => x = t + C1.\n\n2. dy/dt = i => dy = i*dt => y = it + C2.\n\n3. du/dt = 5 => du = 5*dt => u = 5t + C3.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition u(0,y) = 2 + 3i. From the second characteristic equation, we have y = it + C2. When x = 0, we have t = -C1. Thus, y = i(-C1) + C2 => C2 = y + iC1.\n\nNow, we can substitute t = -C1 and C2 = y + iC1 into the third characteristic equation:\n\nu = 5(-C1) + C3 = 2 + 3i.\n\nNow, we can solve for C1 and C3:\n\nC1 = -1, C3 = 7.\n\nThus, the characteristic equations become:\n\nx = t - 1,\ny = it + i(x + 1),\nu = 5t + 7.\n\nNow, we can eliminate t from these equations:\n\nt = x + 1 => y = i(x + 1) + i(x + 1) => y = 2i(x + 1).\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (y/2i) - 1.\n\nFinally, we can substitute this expression for x back into the equation for u:\n\nu = 5((y/2i) - 1) + 7 = (5/2i)y + 2 + 3i.\n\nThus, the complex solution of the given PDE is:\n\nu(x,y) = (5/2i)y + 2 + 3i."
