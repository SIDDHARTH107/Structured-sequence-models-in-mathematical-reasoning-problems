    "message_2": "1. To find the period of the given signal, we need to determine the periods of the individual cosine and sine components and then find the least common multiple (LCM) of those periods.\n\nFor the cosine component, 6cos(4πt), the angular frequency is ω1 = 4π, and the period T1 is given by T1 = 2π/ω1 = 2π/(4π) = 1/2.\n\nFor the sine component, 8sin(6πt), the angular frequency is ω2 = 6π, and the period T2 is given by T2 = 2π/ω2 = 2π/(6π) = 1/3.\n\nNow, we need to find the LCM of T1 and T2. The LCM of 1/2 and 1/3 is 1 (since 1 is the smallest number that both 1/2 and 1/3 divide into evenly). Therefore, the period of the given signal g(t) is T = 1.\n\n2. To calculate the Fourier transform of the signal g(t), we need to express g(t) in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\ng(t) = 4 + 6cos(4πt) + 8sin(6πt)\n     = 4 + 6[0.5 * (e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt))] + 8[-j/2 * (e^(j6πt) - e^(-j6πt))]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform G(f) of g(t):\n\nG(f) = ∫[4δ(t) + 3(e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) - 4j(e^(j6πt) - e^(-j6πt))]e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nCalculating the Fourier transform, we get:\n\nG(f) = 4δ(f) + 3[δ(f - 2) + δ(f + 2)] - 4j[δ(f - 3) - δ(f + 3)]\n\n3. To find the frequency at which the amplitude of the Fourier transform of the signal g(t) is maximum, we need to compare the amplitudes of the different components in G(f):\n\n- The amplitude of the constant component (4δ(f)) is 4.\n- The amplitude of the cosine component (3[δ(f - 2) + δ(f + 2)]) is 3.\n- The amplitude of the sine component (- 4j[δ(f - 3) - δ(f + 3)]) is 4.\n\nThe maximum amplitude is 4, which occurs at the constant component (f = 0) and the sine component (f = 3 and f = -3). Therefore, the frequencies at which the amplitude of the Fourier transform of the signal g(t) is maximum are f = 0, f = 3, and f = -3."
