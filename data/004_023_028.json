    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = x + 2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = x + 2\n\nRearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - x - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = -2:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 + 8)) / 2\nx = (1 ± √9) / 2\nx = (1 ± 3) / 2\n\nSo, we have two points of intersection:\n\nx = (1 + 3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\nx = (1 - 3) / 2 = -2 / 2 = -1\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. The area will be the integral of the difference between the two functions from the left intersection point to the right intersection point:\n\nArea = ∫[(-1, 2)] (x + 2 - x^2) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate the function:\n\nArea = [x^2 / 2 + 2x - x^3 / 3] from -1 to 2\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nArea = [(2^2 / 2 + 2(2) - 2^3 / 3) - ((-1)^2 / 2 + 2(-1) - (-1)^3 / 3)]\nArea = [(4 / 2 + 4 - 8 / 3) - (1 / 2 - 2 + 1 / 3)]\nArea = [(2 + 4 - 8 / 3) - (-1 / 2 + 1 / 3)]\nArea = [14 / 3 - (-1 / 6)]\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nArea = (14 / 3) + (1 / 6)\nArea = (28 / 6) + (1 / 6)\nArea = 29 / 6\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = x + 2 is 29/6 square units."
