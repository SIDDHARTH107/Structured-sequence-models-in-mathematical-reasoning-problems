    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 9, we know that |G| = 9. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. In this case, the only possibility is that n_3 = 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which we will denote by P.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, P, it must be normal in G. Now, we know that the order of P is 3^2 = 9, so P is a group of order 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we know that P must be isomorphic to either C9 (the cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3).\n\nNow, we will show that P cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C3. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that P is isomorphic to C3 × C3. Then P would have at least two distinct elements of order 3, say a and b, such that P = ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩. However, this would mean that the order of the product ab would also be 3, which would imply that G has at least three distinct elements of order 3 (namely, a, b, and ab). But this is a contradiction, since a group of order 9 can have at most one subgroup of order 3 (by the Sylow Theorems, as we showed earlier).\n\nTherefore, P must be isomorphic to C9, which means that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. This proves that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 and not the non-abelian group of order 9 (since there is no non-abelian group of order 9)."
