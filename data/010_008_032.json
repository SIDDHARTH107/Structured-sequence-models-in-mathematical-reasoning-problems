    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this simplicial complex, we have:\n\n- V = 4 (vertices A, B, C, and D)\n- E = 4 (edges AB, BC, CD, and DA)\n- F = 4 (faces ABC, BCD, CDA, and DAB)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nχ = 4 - 4 + 4 = 4\n\nSo the Euler characteristic of this simplicial complex is 4."
