    "message_1": "Consider a Beauty Contest game with four players. Each player independently selects a number from 1 to 100. The winner of the game is the player whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all four numbers chosen. What number should each player choose to maximize their chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chance of winning, each player should try to predict what the other players will choose and then select a number that is two-thirds of the average of those predicted numbers.\n\nLet's assume that all players are rational and know that the other players are also rational. In this case, all players will realize that choosing a number above 66.67 (2/3 of 100) cannot be optimal, as the average of the four numbers can never be above 100. Therefore, the maximum possible value for two-thirds of the average is 66.67.\n\nNow, if all players think that the others will choose numbers between 1 and 66.67, they should choose a number that is two-thirds of the average of this new range. Two-thirds of 66.67 is approximately 44.44. \n\nContinuing this iterative process, we get the following sequence of optimal choices:\n\n1. 66.67 (2/3 of 100)\n2. 44.44 (2/3 of 66.67)\n3. 29.63 (2/3 of 44.44)\n4. 19.75 (2/3 of 29.63)\n5. 13.17 (2/3 of 19.75)\n\nThis process converges to a value close to 0. However, since players must choose a number between 1 and 100, the optimal choice would be to choose the smallest possible number, which is 1. \n\nIn conclusion, to maximize their chance of winning, each player should choose the number 1."
