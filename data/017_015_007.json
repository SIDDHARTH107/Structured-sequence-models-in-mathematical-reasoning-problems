    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct subgroups of order 3 in a group of order 24, we can use the following theorem:\n\nSylow's Third Theorem: If G is a group of order p^a * m, where p is a prime number and p does not divide m, then the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G is congruent to 1 mod p and divides m.\n\nIn this case, the group G has order 24, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^1. We are interested in the number of subgroups of order 3, so we will consider the Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nLet n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G. According to Sylow's Third Theorem, n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3 and divides 2^3 = 8. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4, since these are the divisors of 8 that are congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nHowever, if there were only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it would be normal in G, and G would have a normal subgroup of order 2^3 = 8 as well. This would imply that G is a direct product of these two normal subgroups, and thus G would be isomorphic to a group of order 3 * 8 = 24. But this is not possible since there is no group of order 24 that is a direct product of a group of order 3 and a group of order 8.\n\nTherefore, there must be 4 distinct Sylow 3-subgroups in the group of order 24."
