    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of G using the deletion-contraction recurrence relation, we first need to choose an edge to delete and contract. Let's choose the edge connecting vertices 1 and 3. \n\nNow, we have two subgraphs: G1 with the edge (1,3) deleted, and G2 with the edge (1,3) contracted. The chromatic polynomial of G is given by P(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k).\n\nG1 (with edge (1,3) deleted) looks like this:\n\n```\n1-------2\n|       |\n|       |\n|       |\n|   3   |\n|  / \\  |\n| /   \\ |\n4-------5\n```\n\nG2 (with edge (1,3) contracted) looks like this:\n\n```\n  2\n / \\\n1---3\n|   |\n|   |\n4---5\n```\n\nNow, let's find the chromatic polynomial for G1 and G2.\n\nFor G1, we have a cycle of length 4 (1-2-5-4-1). The chromatic polynomial for a cycle of length n is given by P(C_n, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1). In this case, n = 4, so P(G1, k) = (k-1)^4 + (k-1).\n\nFor G2, we have a complete graph on 4 vertices (K4). The chromatic polynomial for a complete graph on n vertices is given by P(K_n, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1). In this case, n = 4, so P(G2, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial for G using the deletion-contraction recurrence relation:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k) = [(k-1)^4 + (k-1)] - [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)]\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to properly k-color G for k = 1, 2, and 3.\n\nFor k = 1:\nP(G, 1) = [(1-1)^4 + (1-1)] - [1(1-1)(1-2)(1-3)] = 0\n\nFor k = 2:\nP(G, 2) = [(2-1)^4 + (2-1)] - [2(2-1)(2-2)(2-3)] = 1 - (-2) = 3\n\nFor k = 3:\nP(G, 3) = [(3-1)^4 + (3-1)] - [3(3-1)(3-2)(3-3)] = 16 + 2 - 6 = 12\n\nSo, there are 0 ways to properly 1-color G, 3 ways to properly 2-color G, and 12 ways to properly 3-color G."
