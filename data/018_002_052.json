    "message_2": "To show that A ∩ B is a subset of A and a subset of B, we need to find the elements that are common to both sets A and B, and then show that these elements are indeed in both sets.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B. \n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of both sets, we can see that the numbers 2 and 4 are present in both sets A and B. Therefore, A ∩ B = {2, 4}.\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∩ B is a subset of A and a subset of B. \n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if set C is a subset of set D, then every element of C is also an element of D.\n\nLet's check if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nBoth elements of A ∩ B (2 and 4) are also elements of A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nBoth elements of A ∩ B (2 and 4) are also elements of B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nIn conclusion, A ∩ B is a subset of A and a subset of B."
