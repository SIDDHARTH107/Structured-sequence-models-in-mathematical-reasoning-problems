    "message_1": "A rectangular garden is to be built using 100 feet of fencing. What is the largest possible area of the garden? Round the answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter, we need to make it as close to a square as possible. Since the perimeter is 100 feet, we can divide it by 4 to get the dimensions of a square:\n\n100 feet / 4 = 25 feet\n\nSo, the dimensions of the square would be 25 feet by 25 feet. The area of this square would be:\n\nArea = length × width\nArea = 25 feet × 25 feet\nArea = 625 square feet\n\nTherefore, the largest possible area of the garden is approximately 625 square feet."
