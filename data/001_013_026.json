    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(2x + 3) = 5, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(2x + 3))^2 = 5^2\n\nSquaring the square root will cancel it out, and squaring 5 will give us 25:\n\n2x + 3 = 25\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. First, subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n2x = 22\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 11\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(2x + 3) = 5 is x = 11."
