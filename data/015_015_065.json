    "message_1": "What is the average period of the oscillations in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction if the concentration of the catalyst is increased by 20%? Assume that the original average period is 10 seconds and that the relationship between catalyst concentration and period is linear.",
    "message_2": "Since the relationship between catalyst concentration and period is linear, we can use the following equation to find the new average period:\n\nNew average period = Original average period * (1 - Change in concentration)\n\nHere, the original average period is 10 seconds, and the change in concentration is 20% (0.20 as a decimal). We have:\n\nNew average period = 10 * (1 - 0.20)\n\nNew average period = 10 * 0.80\n\nNew average period = 8 seconds\n\nSo, the average period of the oscillations in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction when the concentration of the catalyst is increased by 20% is 8 seconds."
