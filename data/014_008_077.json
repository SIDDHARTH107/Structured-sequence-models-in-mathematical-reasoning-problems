    "message_2": "Since the block size is 64 bits, the 128-bit plaintext will be divided into two blocks of 64 bits each. The block cipher will encrypt each 64-bit block separately.\n\nThe maximum number of unique ciphertext values for a 64-bit block is 2^64, as there are 2^64 possible combinations of 0s and 1s in a 64-bit block.\n\nSince there are two blocks in the 128-bit plaintext, the maximum number of unique ciphertext values for the entire 128-bit plaintext is (2^64) * (2^64) = 2^128."
