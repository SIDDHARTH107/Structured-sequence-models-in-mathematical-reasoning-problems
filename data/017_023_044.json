    "message_2": "Let's denote the order of a group by |G|, and the order of an element x by o(x). We are given that |G| = 72, |H| = 8, and o(x) = 3 for some x ∈ G but x ∉ H.\n\nSince H is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 72/8 = 9. Since 9 is a prime power (3^2), G/H is a p-group and therefore has a non-trivial center. Let Z(G/H) be the center of G/H. Then |Z(G/H)| is a divisor of |G/H| = 9, so |Z(G/H)| = 1, 3, or 9.\n\nCase 1: |Z(G/H)| = 1\nThis case is not possible, as we have already established that the center of G/H is non-trivial.\n\nCase 2: |Z(G/H)| = 3\nIn this case, Z(G/H) is a subgroup of G/H of order 3. Let K be a subgroup of G such that K/H = Z(G/H). Then |K| = |H| * |Z(G/H)| = 8 * 3 = 24. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, K is also a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/K. The order of G/K is |G|/|K| = 72/24 = 3. Since 3 is prime, G/K is a cyclic group of order 3. Let y be an element of G such that yK generates G/K. Then o(yK) = 3, and o(y) is a multiple of 3. Since x also has order 3, we can write x = y^n for some integer n.\n\nSince H is a normal subgroup of K, we have y^3 ∈ H. Thus, x^3 = (y^n)^3 = y^(3n) ∈ H. But we are given that x ∉ H, so x^3 ≠ e (the identity element). This is a contradiction, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 3: |Z(G/H)| = 9\nIn this case, G/H is an abelian group, so G is a semi-direct product of H and a subgroup K of order 9. Since |H| = 8 and |K| = 9, we have gcd(|H|, |K|) = 1, so H ∩ K = {e}. Therefore, |HK| = |H| * |K| = 72, and G = HK.\n\nSince H is a normal subgroup of G, the action of K on H by conjugation is a homomorphism from K to Aut(H), the group of automorphisms of H. Since |H| = 8, H is either isomorphic to Z_8 (the cyclic group of order 8) or to Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 (the direct product of three copies of Z_2). In either case, |Aut(H)| = 8.\n\nSince |K| = 9, the homomorphism from K to Aut(H) has a kernel of order 1 or 3. If the kernel has order 1, then K is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut(H), and G is a semi-direct product of H and K. If the kernel has order 3, then K is isomorphic to a quotient of Aut(H), and G is an extension of H by K.\n\nIn either case, G is a non-abelian group of order 72. There are 51 such groups up to isomorphism, so G must be isomorphic to one of them."
