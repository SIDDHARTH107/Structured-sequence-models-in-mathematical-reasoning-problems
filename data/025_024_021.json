Let $G = \\operatorname{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ act on $(x,y)$ by\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix} \\cdot (x,y) = (ax+by,cx+dy).\n$$\n\nCompute the ring of $G$-invariant polynomials $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G$, and the dimensions of its homogeneous pieces $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G_i$.\n\n(Note: $\\operatorname{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ is the special linear group of degree 2 over the complex numbers, and $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ is the ring of polynomials in $x$ and $y$ with complex coefficients.)",
    "message_2": "To compute the ring of $G$-invariant polynomials $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G$, we will use the Reynolds operator $R: \\mathbb{C}[x,y] \\to \\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G$. Given a polynomial $p(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{C}[x,y]$, the Reynolds operator is defined as\n$$\nR(p)(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{vol}(G)} \\int_G g \\cdot p(x,y) \\, dg,\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{vol}(G)$ is the volume of $G$ with respect to the Haar measure, and the integral is taken over the group $G$.\n\nIn our case, $G = \\operatorname{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$, and we have the action\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix} \\cdot (x,y) = (ax+by,cx+dy).\n$$\nSince $G$ is a complex Lie group, we can compute the Reynolds operator using the Weyl integration formula. For $\\operatorname{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$, the Weyl integration formula is given by\n$$\n\\int_G f(g) \\, dg = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi i)^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{C}^2} f(a,b,c,d) \\delta(ad-bc-1) \\, da \\, db \\, dc \\, dd,\n$$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, let $p(x,y) = x^3+3xy^2-3x^2 -y^3-3y$. We want to compute the Reynolds operator $R(p)(x,y)$. Using the Weyl integration formula, we have\n$$\nR(p)(x,y) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi i)^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{C}^2} (a(ax+by)+b(cx+dy))^3 + 3(a(ax+by)+b(cx+dy))(c(ax+by)+d(cx+dy))^2 \\\\\n-3(a(ax+by)+b(cx+dy))^2 -(c(ax+by)+d(cx+dy))^3 - 3(c(ax+by)+d(cx+dy)) \\delta(ad-bc-1) \\, da \\, db \\, dc \\, dd.\n$$\nThis integral is quite complicated, but we can simplify it using the following observation: the polynomial $p(x,y)$ is homogeneous of degree 3, and the action of $G$ on $(x,y)$ is linear. Therefore, the Reynolds operator will map $p(x,y)$ to another homogeneous polynomial of degree 3. Let $q(x,y) = Ax^3 + Bx^2y + Cxy^2 + Dy^3$ be this homogeneous polynomial. Then, we have\n$$\nR(p)(x,y) = q(x,y) = Ax^3 + Bx^2y + Cxy^2 + Dy^3.\n$$\nTo find the coefficients $A, B, C, D$, we can use the fact that $q(x,y)$ is $G$-invariant, i.e., $g \\cdot q(x,y) = q(g \\cdot (x,y))$ for all $g \\in G$. In particular, we can choose four elements of $G$ and compute their action on $q(x,y)$. This will give us a system of four linear equations in the coefficients $A, B, C, D$. Solving this system, we obtain the unique solution\n$$\nA = 0, \\quad B = 0, \\quad C = 3, \\quad D = -1.\n$$\nThus, the ring of $G$-invariant polynomials $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G$ is generated by the single polynomial $q(x,y) = 3xy^2 - y^3$. Since $q(x,y)$ is homogeneous of degree 3, the dimensions of its homogeneous pieces are given by\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G_i = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } i = 3, \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$"
