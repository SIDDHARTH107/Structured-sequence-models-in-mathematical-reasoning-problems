    "message_1": "A building is located 150 meters away from where you are standing. If you measure the angle of elevation to the top of the building and find it to be 30 degrees, what is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the distance from you to the building (adjacent side) is 150 meters, and the height of the building (opposite side) is what we want to find.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30) = height / 150\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 150:\n\nheight = 150 * tan(30)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nheight ≈ 150 * 0.577\n\nheight ≈ 86.55 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 86.55 meters."
