    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 2  3  1 | 9\n| 4  2  3 | 15\n| 3  4  2 | 10\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  1.5  0.5 | 4.5\n| 4  2    3   | 15\n| 3  4    2   | 10\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1.5  0.5 | 4.5\n| 0 -4   1   | -3\n| 0  0.5  0.5 | 1.5\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by -1/4 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  1.5  0.5 | 4.5\n| 0  1   -0.25 | 0.75\n| 0  0.5  0.5 | 1.5\n\nStep 4: Subtract 1.5 times the second row from the first row and 0.5 times the second row from the third row:\n\n| 1  0  0.875 | 3.375\n| 0  1 -0.25  | 0.75\n| 0  0  0.625 | 1.125\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 0.625 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  0  0.875 | 3.375\n| 0  1 -0.25  | 0.75\n| 0  0  1     | 1.8\n\nStep 6: Subtract 0.875 times the third row from the first row and add 0.25 times the third row to the second row:\n\n| 1  0  0 | 0.75\n| 0  1  0 | 1.2\n| 0  0  1 | 1.8\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the row-echelon form:\n\nx = 0.75\ny = 1.2\nz = 1.8"
