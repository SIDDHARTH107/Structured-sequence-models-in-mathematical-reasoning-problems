    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to estimate the probability that a randomly selected product from a production line is defective. To do this, they decide to simulate a production line that produces 1000 products using Monte Carlo simulation. In this simulation, they assume that the probability of a product being defective is 0.05. How many defective products do you expect to find in this simulation?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the number of defective products in the simulation, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number of defective products = Total number of products × Probability of a product being defective\n\nIn this case, the total number of products is 1000, and the probability of a product being defective is 0.05.\n\nExpected number of defective products = 1000 × 0.05 = 50\n\nSo, we expect to find 50 defective products in this simulation."
