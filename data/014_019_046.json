    "message_2": "To solve this transposition cipher, we need to rearrange the numbers according to the given cipher text. The cipher text \"5 9 8 1 4 7 2 6 3\" represents the positions of the original message.\n\nLet's use the numbers 1 to 9 as placeholders for the original message:\n\nOriginal message: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nNow, we will place the numbers according to the positions given in the cipher text:\n\n5th position: _ _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ _\n9th position: _ _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ 2\n8th position: _ _ _ _ 1 _ _ 3 2\n1st position: 4 _ _ _ 1 _ _ 3 2\n4th position: 4 _ _ 5 1 _ _ 3 2\n7th position: 4 _ _ 5 1 _ 6 3 2\n2nd position: 4 7 _ 5 1 _ 6 3 2\n6th position: 4 7 _ 5 1 8 6 3 2\n3rd position: 4 7 9 5 1 8 6 3 2\n\nSo, the original message is \"4 7 9 5 1 8 6 3 2\"."
