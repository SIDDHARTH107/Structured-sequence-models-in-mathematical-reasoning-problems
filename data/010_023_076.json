    "message_1": "What is the unknotting number of the following knot?\n\nTwist one end of a 1-meter long piece of rope $n$ full turns and then tie the ends together to form a closed loop. This gives you a knot. What is the smallest integer value of $n$ for which this knot can be unknotted without cutting?",
    "message_2": "The knot described is known as a \"twist knot\" or a \"cable knot.\" The smallest integer value of $n$ for which this knot can be unknotted without cutting is when $n=0$ or $n=1$.\n\nWhen $n=0$, there are no twists in the rope, and it is already in an unknotted state.\n\nWhen $n=1$, you have a single twist in the rope. After tying the ends together, you can simply rotate one end of the loop to undo the twist, resulting in an unknotted loop.\n\nFor any other integer value of $n$, the knot will remain knotted and cannot be undone without cutting the rope."
