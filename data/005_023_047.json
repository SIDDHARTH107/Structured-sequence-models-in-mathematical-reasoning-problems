    "message_2": "To use the Tukey Method of outlier detection, we first need to find the interquartile range (IQR) of the data set. The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nStep 1: Sort the data in ascending order:\n```\n15, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 87, 88, 90, 92\n```\n\nStep 2: Find Q1 and Q3:\nSince there are 10 data points, we can find the quartiles as follows:\n\nQ1 is the median of the first half of the data (excluding the overall median if there is an odd number of data points):\n```\n15, 76, 78, 80, 84\n```\nThe median of this subset is 78.\n\nQ3 is the median of the second half of the data (excluding the overall median if there is an odd number of data points):\n```\n85, 87, 88, 90, 92\n```\nThe median of this subset is 88.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the IQR:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 88 - 78 = 10\n\nStep 4: Determine the outlier boundaries:\nLower boundary = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 78 - 1.5 * 10 = 63\nUpper boundary = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 88 + 1.5 * 10 = 103\n\nStep 5: Identify any outliers:\nNow we check if any data points fall outside the lower and upper boundaries:\n\nThe only data point that falls below the lower boundary is 15.\n\nTherefore, using the Tukey Method of outlier detection, the outlier in the data set is 15."
