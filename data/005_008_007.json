The data is given in the table below:\n\n| Month | Units Sold |\n|-------|------------|\n| Jan   | 150        |\n| Feb   | 140        |\n| Mar   | 170        |\n| Apr   | 210        |\n| May   | 250        |\n| June  | 300        |\n| July  | 330        |\n| Aug   | 290        |\n| Sep   | 240        |\n| Oct   | 200        |\n| Nov   | 160        |\n| Dec   | 140        |\n\nDetermine the following statistics for this time series data: \n\n1.

    "message_2": "To calculate the statistics, we first need to organize the data:\n\nUnits Sold: 140, 140, 150, 160, 170, 200, 210, 240, 250, 290, 300, 330\n\n1. Mean:\n(140 + 140 + 150 + 160 + 170 + 200 + 210 + 240 + 250 + 290 + 300 + 330) / 12 = 2470 / 12 = 205.83\n\nMean = 205.83\n\n2. Median:\nSince there are 12 data points, the median will be the average of the 6th and 7th values.\n\n(200 + 210) / 2 = 410 / 2 = 205\n\nMedian = 205\n\n3. Mode:\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. In this case, the value 140 appears twice, while all other values appear only once.\n\nMode = 140\n\n4. Range:\nThe range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set.\n\nRange = 330 - 140 = 190\n\n5. Standard deviation:\nFirst, we need to find the variance. To do this, we calculate the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n\n[(140 - 205.83)^2 + (140 - 205.83)^2 + (150 - 205.83)^2 + ... + (330 - 205.83)^2] / 12\n\n[(-65.83)^2 + (-65.83)^2 + (-55.83)^2 + ... + (124.17)^2] / 12\n\n[4335.89 + 4335.89 + 3116.89 + ... + 15416.09] / 12\n\n[104080.96] / 12 = 8665.08 (variance)\n\nNow, we take the square root of the variance to find the standard deviation.\n\nStandard deviation = âˆš8665.08 = 93.08\n\nSo, the statistics for this time series data are:\n\n1. Mean: 205.83\n2. Median: 205\n3. Mode: 140\n4. Range: 190\n5. Standard deviation: 93.08"
