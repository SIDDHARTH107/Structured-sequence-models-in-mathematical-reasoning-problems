    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8}. Find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B, and then find the union of the symmetric difference of A and B with set C = {3, 6, 9}. Finally, find the symmetric difference of the set union of A and B with set C. Verify whether the symmetric difference of the set union of A and B with C is distributive over union or not.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 3} ∪ {6, 8} = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the symmetric difference of A and B with set C.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 6, 8} ∪ {3, 6, 9} = {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of the set union of A and B with set C.\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ C = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8} ∆ {3, 6, 9}) = (A ∪ B) - C ∪ C - (A ∪ B) = {1, 2, 4, 8} ∪ {9} = {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's verify whether the symmetric difference of the set union of A and B with C is distributive over union or not. The symmetric difference is distributive over union if the following equation holds:\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ C = (A ∆ C) ∪ (B ∆ C)\n\nWe have already found (A ∪ B) ∆ C = {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}.
