    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of the two equal sides are 10 cm each. What is the length of the third side if the triangle's perimeter is 28 cm?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the third side be x cm. Since the triangle's perimeter is 28 cm, we can write the equation:\n\n10 + 10 + x = 28\n\n20 + x = 28\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 28 - 20\nx = 8\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 8 cm."
