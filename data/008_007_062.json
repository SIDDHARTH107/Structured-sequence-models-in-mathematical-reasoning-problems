    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and invertible matrix P, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[ 2  -1 ]\n[ 4  -3 ]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [ 2-λ  -1   ]\n                 [ 4    -3-λ ]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (2-λ)((-3)-λ) - (-1)(4) = λ^2 + λ - 6 + 4 = λ^2 + λ - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the equation λ^2 + λ - 2 = 0. This can be factored as (λ + 2)(λ - 1) = 0. So, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = -2.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n(A - λ1I)X = 0\n[ 1  -1 ] [x1]   [0]\n[ 4  -4 ] [x2]   [0]\n\nx1 - x2 = 0 => x1 = x2\nLet x2 = 1, then x1 = 1. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 1 is v1 = [1, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = -2:\n(A - λ2I)X = 0\n[ 4  -1 ] [x1]   [0]\n[ 4  -1 ] [x2]   [0]\n\n4x1 - x2 = 0 => x2 = 4x1\nLet x1 = 1, then x2 = 4. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = -2 is v2 = [1, 4].\n\n3. Form the matrix P and D:\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D using the eigenvalues as the diagonal entries.\n\nMatrix P:\n[ 1  1 ]\n[ 1  4 ]\n\nMatrix D:\n[ 1   0 ]\n[ 0  -2 ]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix P, denoted as P^-1.\n\n4. Find the inverse of matrix P (P^-1):\nTo find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the formula:\n\nP^-1 = (1/det(P)) * [ d  -b ]\n                                      [ -c  a ]\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are the elements of the matrix P:\n\nP = [ a  b ]\n       [ c  d ]\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, and d = 4.\n\ndet(P) = ad - bc = (1)(4) - (1)(1) = 4 - 1 = 3\n\nP^-1 = (1/3) * [  4  -1 ]\n                      [ -1   1 ]\n\nP^-1 = [ 4/3  -1/3 ]\n           [ -1/3  1/3 ]\n\nNow, we have the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P and its inverse P^-1:\n\nA = PDP^-1 = [ 1  1 ] [ 1   0 ] [ 4/3  -1/3 ]\n                   [ 1  4 ] [ 0  -2 ] [ -1/3  1/3 ]\n\nSo, the diagonal matrix D is:\n[ 1   0 ]\n[ 0  -2 ]\n\nand the invertible matrix P is:\n[ 1  1 ]\n[ 1  4 ]"
