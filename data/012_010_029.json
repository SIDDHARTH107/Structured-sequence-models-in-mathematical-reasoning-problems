    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover for a given graph.\n\nWe can use the relationship between the size of a vertex cover (VC), the size of a maximum matching (MM), and the number of vertices (V) in a bipartite graph, which is given by the KÃ¶nig's theorem:\n\nVC + MM = V\n\nHowever, we don't know if the given graph G is bipartite or not. So, we need to find an upper bound for the minimum vertex cover using other methods.\n\nIn any graph, the minimum vertex cover is always greater than or equal to the size of a maximum matching. This is because each edge in a matching is disjoint, and we need at least one vertex to cover each edge in the matching.\n\nSince G has 15 edges, the maximum possible size of a matching is 15/2 = 7.5. Since the size of a matching must be an integer, the maximum matching size is at most 7.\n\nTherefore, the minimum size of a vertex cover for G is at least 7."
