    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a trapezium, we simply add the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the longer base is 10 cm, the shorter base is 6 cm, and the two sides are 8 cm each.\n\nPerimeter = Longer base + Shorter base + Side 1 + Side 2\nPerimeter = 10 cm + 6 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm\nPerimeter = 32 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 32 cm."
