    "message_1": "A company has two options: Option A will cost them $10,000 initially and will have a 30% chance of yielding $30,000 in profit. Option B will cost them $8,000 initially and will have a 50% chance of yielding $20,000 in profit. Which option has the higher expected value and which option should the company choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine the expected value of each option, we need to calculate the expected profit by multiplying the probability of success by the potential profit and then subtracting the initial cost.\n\nOption A:\nExpected profit = (0.30 * $30,000) - $10,000\nExpected profit = $9,000 - $10,000\nExpected profit = -$1,000\n\nOption B:\nExpected profit = (0.50 * $20,000) - $8,000\nExpected profit = $10,000 - $8,000\nExpected profit = $2,000\n\nOption B has a higher expected value of $2,000, while Option A has an expected value of -$1,000. Therefore, the company should choose Option B."
