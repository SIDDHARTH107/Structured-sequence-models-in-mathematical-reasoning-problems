    "message_2": "A rational curve in the projective plane can be parameterized by two homogeneous polynomials of the same degree, say F(x, y, z) and G(x, y, z), where F and G have no common factors. The degree of the rational curve is the degree of these polynomials.\n\nConsider a rational curve passing through 5 general points in the projective plane, say P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5. We want to find the smallest degree d such that there exists a rational curve of degree d passing through these points.\n\nA rational curve of degree 1 is a projective line. However, 5 general points do not lie on a single line. Therefore, the degree of the rational curve must be greater than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider a rational curve of degree 2. A conic (a curve of degree 2) in the projective plane can be parameterized by two homogeneous quadratic polynomials, say F(x, y, z) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dxz + eyz + fz^2 and G(x, y, z) = a'x^2 + b'xy + c'y^2 + d'xz + e'yz + f'z^2.\n\nSince there are 6 coefficients in each polynomial, we have a total of 12 coefficients to determine. However, we have a projective equivalence, which means we can scale the coefficients by a nonzero constant, so we have 11 degrees of freedom.\n\nWe have 5 general points, and each point imposes 2 conditions on the coefficients (one for F and one for G). Therefore, we have a total of 10 conditions.\n\nSince we have 11 degrees of freedom and 10 conditions, we can find a conic (a rational curve of degree 2) passing through the 5 general points in the projective plane.\n\nHence, the degree of a rational curve passing through 5 general points in the projective plane is 2."
