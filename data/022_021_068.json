    "message_2": "First, let's find the Laplace transform of the given function f(t) = t^3 * e^(-3t). The Laplace transform is defined as:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) * f(t) dt\n\nSo for our function, we have:\n\nF(s) = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) * t^3 * e^(-3t) dt\n\nNow, let's find the complex line integral of F(s) over the given contour Γ. The contour consists of three segments: C₁ from -i to i on the imaginary axis, C₂ from i to 1+i along the line y=x, and C₃ from 1+i back to -i along the semicircle x²+y²=1.\n\n1. For C₁, we parameterize the segment as z = yi, where y ∈ [-1, 1]. Then, dz = i dy, and the integral becomes:\n\n∫(C₁) F(s) ds = ∫(-1)^(1) F(yi) * i dy\n\n2. For C₂, we parameterize the segment as z = x + xi, where x ∈ [0, 1]. Then, dz = (1+i) dx, and the integral becomes:\n\n∫(C₂) F(s) ds = ∫(0)^(1) F(x+xi) * (1+i) dx\n\n3. For C₃, we parameterize the semicircle as z = e^(iθ), where θ ∈ [π, 2π]. Then, dz = i * e^(iθ) dθ, and the integral becomes:\n\n∫(C₃) F(s) ds = ∫(π)^(2π) F(e^(iθ)) * i * e^(iθ) dθ\n\nNow, we sum the integrals over the three segments to find the total complex line integral over the contour Γ:\n\n∫(Γ) F(s) ds = ∫(C₁) F(s) ds + ∫(C₂) F(s) ds + ∫(C₃) F(s) ds\n\nTo compute these integrals, we would need to find the Laplace transform F(s) explicitly and then substitute the parameterizations for each segment. However, this is a very complicated task and may not have a closed-form solution. In practice, one would use numerical methods to approximate the value of the complex line integral."
