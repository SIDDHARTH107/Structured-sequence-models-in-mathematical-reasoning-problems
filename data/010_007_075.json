    "message_1": "Consider a space X which is a torus with a hole (topologically equivalent to a cylinder). Determine the fundamental group of this space using the fact that this space can be covered by a universal cover which is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane R2.",
    "message_2": "Since the space X is topologically equivalent to a cylinder, we can consider the cylinder as our space. Let's denote the cylinder as C. Now, we are given that C can be covered by a universal cover homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane R^2. Let's denote this universal cover as p: R^2 → C.\n\nThe fundamental group of C, denoted as π_1(C), can be determined using the covering space theory. According to the covering space theory, there is a correspondence between the subgroups of the fundamental group of the base space (C in our case) and the connected covering spaces of the base space.\n\nSince R^2 is simply connected (i.e., its fundamental group is trivial), the fundamental group of C, π_1(C), corresponds to the deck transformation group of the covering p: R^2 → C. The deck transformation group is a group of homeomorphisms of R^2 that preserve the fibers of the covering map p.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of the cylinder C. We can obtain C by identifying the opposite edges of a rectangle in the Euclidean plane. Let's denote the sides of the rectangle as a and b, and let A and B be the corresponding loops in C based at a point x_0 in C. Then, the fundamental group of C is generated by these loops, i.e., π_1(C) = <A, B>.\n\nThe deck transformation group of the covering p: R^2 → C consists of translations along the integer multiples of the vectors corresponding to the sides a and b of the rectangle. Therefore, the deck transformation group is isomorphic to the group Z × Z, where Z is the group of integers.\n\nSince the fundamental group of C corresponds to the deck transformation group, we have:\n\nπ_1(C) ≅ Z × Z.\n\nHence, the fundamental group of the space X, which is topologically equivalent to a cylinder, is isomorphic to the group Z × Z."
