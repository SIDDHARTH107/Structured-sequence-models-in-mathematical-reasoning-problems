Let's use integration by parts twice.\n\nFirst, let u = t^2 and dv = e^(-(s+3)t) dt. Then, du = 2t dt and v = -1/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t).\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = -t^2/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) |(from 0 to ∞) + (2/(s+3))∫(from 0 to ∞) te^(-(s+3)t) dt\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts again on the remaining integral. Let u = t and dv = e^(-(s+3)t) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -1/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t).\n\nF(s) = -t^2/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) |(from 0 to ∞) + (2/(s+3))[-te^(-(s+3)t)/(s+3) |(from 0 to ∞) - ∫(from 0 to ∞) e^(-(s+3)t) dt]\n\nNow, we can solve the remaining integral:\n\nF(s) = -t^2/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) |(from 0 to ∞) + (2/(s+3))[-te^(-(s+3)t)/(s+3) |(from 0 to ∞) + 1/((s+3)^2)∫(from 0 to ∞) e^(-(s+3)t) dt]\n\nThe last integral is a simple exponential integral, which results in:\n\nF(s) = -t^2/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) |(from 0 to ∞) + (2/(s+3))[-te^(-(s+3)t)/(s+3) |(from 0 to ∞) + 1/((s+3)^2)[-e^(-(s+3)t)/(s+3) |(from 0 to ∞)]]\n\nNow, we evaluate the limits:\n\nF(s) = 0 - 0 + (2/(s+3))[0 - 0 + 1/((s+3)^2)[-(-1)/(s+3)]]\n\nF(s) = 2/((s+3)^3)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = t^2e^(-3t) is:\n\nF(s) = 2/((s+3)^3)"
