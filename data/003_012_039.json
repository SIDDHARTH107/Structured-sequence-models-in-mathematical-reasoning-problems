    "message_2": "To find the height at which the ladder touches the wall, we can use trigonometry. In this case, we have a right triangle with a 60-degree angle, and we know the length of the adjacent side (the base of the ladder, which is 3 meters away from the wall). We want to find the length of the opposite side (the height at which the ladder touches the wall).\n\nWe can use the tangent function to solve this problem:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn our case, θ = 60 degrees, and the adjacent side is 3 meters. We want to find the opposite side (the height).\n\ntan(60) = height / 3\n\nTo find the tangent of 60 degrees, you can use a calculator or remember that tan(60) = √3.\n\n√3 = height / 3\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 3 * √3\n\nheight ≈ 3 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 5.196 meters\n\nSo, the height at which the ladder touches the wall is approximately 5.196 meters."
