    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 10 people where every pair of them is either friends or enemies. What is the smallest number of pairs of friends or enemies that must exist in this group, so that there is either a group of 3 mutual friends or a group of 4 mutual enemies?",
    "message_2": "We will use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. Let's consider one person in the group. This person has 9 relationships with the other members of the group, which can be either friendships or enmities. If this person has at least 4 friends or at least 6 enemies, we can stop, as we have either a group of 3 mutual friends or a group of 4 mutual enemies.\n\nNow, let's assume that every person has at most 3 friends and at most 5 enemies. In this case, there are 10 people, and each person has 3 friends. Therefore, there are a total of (10 * 3) / 2 = 15 pairs of friends in the group.\n\nNext, we will show that there must be a group of 3 mutual friends or a group of 4 mutual enemies in this case. Consider a pair of friends, A and B. They have 7 other people in the group, and since A and B are friends, they have at most 5 enemies each. Therefore, there are at most 5 + 5 = 10 pairs of enemies involving A or B.\n\nHowever, there are 9 pairs of relationships involving A or B (excluding the friendship between A and B). Since there are at most 10 pairs of enemies involving A or B, there must be at least 9 - 10 = -1 pairs of friends involving A or B. This is a contradiction, as there cannot be a negative number of pairs of friends.\n\nThus, our assumption that every person has at most 3 friends and at most 5 enemies is incorrect. Therefore, the smallest number of pairs of friends or enemies that must exist in this group, so that there is either a group of 3 mutual friends or a group of 4 mutual enemies, is 4 friends or 6 enemies."
