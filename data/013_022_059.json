    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game with two players, player 1 is given $100 and asked to split it with player 2 in any way they choose. If player 2 accepts their offer, both players keep their share. If player 2 rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. What is the optimal way for player 1 to split the money if they want to maximize their own payoff and believe player 2 will accept any offer greater than $20?",
    "message_2": "If player 1 believes that player 2 will accept any offer greater than $20, then the optimal way for player 1 to split the money to maximize their own payoff is to offer player 2 exactly $21. This way, player 1 keeps $79 for themselves, which is the highest amount they can keep while still ensuring that player 2 accepts the offer. The split would be $79 for player 1 and $21 for player 2."
