Show that the polynomial ring k[x,y] is generated by the G_a-invariant polynomials u = y^2 and v = x^2+y^2.\n\nSpecific numerical problem to solve: Determine the ideal of G_a-invariant polynomials in k[x,y] and show that it is generated by u and v.",
    "message_2": "To show that the polynomial ring k[x,y] is generated by the G_a-invariant polynomials u = y^2 and v = x^2 + y^2, we need to find the ideal of G_a-invariant polynomials in k[x,y] and show that it is generated by u and v.\n\nFirst, let's find the ideal of G_a-invariant polynomials. A polynomial f(x,y) in k[x,y] is G_a-invariant if f(x,y) = f(t+x,x,y) for all t in k. Let's compute the action of G_a on x and y:\n\nx' = t + x\ny' = y\n\nNow, let's find the polynomials that are invariant under this action. We want f(x',y') = f(x,y), so:\n\nf(t+x,y) = f(x,y)\n\nLet's consider the monomials in f(x,y). For a monomial x^i y^j, we have:\n\n(x')^i (y')^j = (t+x)^i y^j\n\nExpanding (t+x)^i using the binomial theorem, we get:\n\nÎ£ (from k=0 to i) (i choose k) t^k x^(i-k) y^j\n\nFor f(t+x,y) to be equal to f(x,y), the coefficients of the monomials in f(t+x,y) must be the same as those in f(x,y). This implies that the only monomials that can appear in a G_a-invariant polynomial are those of the form x^i y^j with j even.\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomials u = y^2 and v = x^2 + y^2. Clearly, both of these polynomials are G_a-invariant:\n\nu(t+x,y) = y^2 = u(x,y)\nv(t+x,y) = (t+x)^2 + y^2 = x^2 + 2tx + t^2 + y^2 = v(x,y) + 2tx + t^2\n\nSince the action of G_a is by translation in the x-direction, the ideal of G_a-invariant polynomials is generated by the polynomials that are invariant under this action. We have shown that u and v are G_a-invariant, and any polynomial of the form x^i y^j with j even can be written as a polynomial in u and v:\n\nx^i y^j = (x^2 + y^2 - y^2)^i y^j = (v - u)^i y^j\n\nThus, the ideal of G_a-invariant polynomials in k[x,y] is generated by u = y^2 and v = x^2 + y^2."
