    "message_1": "Suppose the current price of a stock is $100. The probability that the stock price will increase by 10% in the next month is 0.3, and the probability that the stock price will decrease by 5% in the same month is 0.2. What is the probability that the stock price will be between $95 and $110 one month from now?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock price will be between $95 and $110 one month from now, we need to consider the two scenarios that lead to this outcome: the stock price increases by 10% or the stock price decreases by 5%.\n\n1. If the stock price increases by 10%, it will be $100 * 1.10 = $110. The probability of this happening is 0.3.\n\n2. If the stock price decreases by 5%, it will be $100 * 0.95 = $95. The probability of this happening is 0.2.\n\nSince these two scenarios are mutually exclusive (the stock price can't both increase by 10% and decrease by 5% in the same month), we can simply add the probabilities of these two scenarios to find the probability that the stock price will be between $95 and $110 one month from now:\n\nP(stock price between $95 and $110) = P(stock price increases by 10%) + P(stock price decreases by 5%) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will be between $95 and $110 one month from now is 0.5 or 50%."
