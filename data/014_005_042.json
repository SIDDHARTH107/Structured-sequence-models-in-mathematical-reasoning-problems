    "message_1": "Suppose a sender wants to digitally sign a message consisting of 10 characters using RSA algorithm with a private key of length 2048 bits. If the hash function used to compute the message digest produces a 160-bit output, what will be the size of the digital signature?",
    "message_2": "In the RSA digital signature scheme, the size of the digital signature is determined by the key length used for signing, not by the size of the message or the hash function output. In this case, the private key has a length of 2048 bits. Therefore, the size of the digital signature will also be 2048 bits."
