    "message_2": "To show that the theory $T$ has a model that is isomorphic to the standard model of the natural numbers, we will construct a model for $T$ and then show that it is isomorphic to the standard model of the natural numbers, which is the set $\\mathbb{N}$ with the usual order relation $<$.\n\nLet's first define the model $\\mathcal{M}$ for the theory $T$. The domain of $\\mathcal{M}$ will be the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$. The interpretation of the constant symbol $0$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ will be the natural number $0$. The interpretation of the binary relation symbol $<$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ will be the usual order relation $<$ on the natural numbers.\n\nNow, we need to show that $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies all the axioms of $T$. Since $T$ is the set of all axioms of Peano arithmetic that can be expressed in this language, we need to show that $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies the axioms of Peano arithmetic that involve only the relation symbol $<$ and the constant symbol $0$. These axioms are:\n\n1. $\\forall x (\\lnot (x < 0))$\n2. $\\forall x \\forall y (x < y \\rightarrow \\exists z (x < z \\land z < y))$\n3. $\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z ((x < y \\land y < z) \\rightarrow x < z)$\n4. $\\forall x \\forall y (x < y \\lor x = y \\lor y < x)$\n\nIt is easy to see that $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies all these axioms:\n\n1. In $\\mathcal{M}$, no natural number is less than $0$, so this axiom is satisfied.\n2. In $\\mathcal{M}$, for any two natural numbers $x$ and $y$ with $x < y$, there exists a natural number $z$ such that $x < z$ and $z < y$. This is because we can choose $z = \\frac{x+y}{2}$, which satisfies the required conditions. So this axiom is satisfied.\n3. In $\\mathcal{M}$, the order relation $<$ is transitive, so this axiom is satisfied.\n4. In $\\mathcal{M}$, the order relation $<$ is a total order, so this axiom is satisfied.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies all the axioms of $T$, it is a model for $T$. Now, we need to show that $\\mathcal{M}$ is isomorphic to the standard model of the natural numbers, which is the set $\\mathbb{N}$ with the usual order relation $<$.\n\nConsider the identity function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$, defined by $f(x) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We claim that $f$ is an isomorphism between $\\mathcal{M}$ and the standard model of the natural numbers.\n\nFirst, note that $f$ is a bijection, since it is both injective and surjective. Now, we need to show that $f$ preserves the order relation. That is, for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $x < y$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ if and only if $f(x) < f(y)$ in the standard model of the natural numbers. But since $f$ is the identity function, this is trivially true.\n\nThus, $f$ is an isomorphism between $\\mathcal{M}$ and the standard model of the natural numbers. This shows that the theory $T$ has a model that is isomorphic to the standard model of the natural numbers."
