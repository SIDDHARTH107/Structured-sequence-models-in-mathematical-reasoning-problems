The yield data (in bushels per acre) for each treatment are as follows:\n\nTreatment 1: 300, 320, 315, 310\nTreatment 2: 290, 280, 300, 290\nTreatment 3: 310, 305, 315, 320\nTreatment 4: 280, 290, 285, 295\n\nPerform an ANOVA on the data and test whether there is a significant difference between the mean yields of the different treatments at 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we first need to calculate the following values:\n\n1. The mean yield for each treatment.\n2. The overall mean yield.\n3. The sum of squares between treatments (SSB).\n4. The sum of squares within treatments (SSW).\n5. The mean square between treatments (MSB).\n6. The mean square within treatments (MSW).\n7. The F-statistic.\n8. The critical F-value.\n\nLet's calculate these values step by step.\n\n1. Mean yield for each treatment:\n\nTreatment 1: (300 + 320 + 315 + 310) / 4 = 311.25\nTreatment 2: (290 + 280 + 300 + 290) / 4 = 290\nTreatment 3: (310 + 305 + 315 + 320) / 4 = 312.5\nTreatment 4: (280 + 290 + 285 + 295) / 4 = 287.5\n\n2. Overall mean yield:\n\n(311.25 + 290 + 312.5 + 287.5) / 4 = 300.3125\n\n3. Sum of squares between treatments (SSB):\n\nSSB = 4 * [(311.25 - 300.3125)^2 + (290 - 300.3125)^2 + (312.5 - 300.3125)^2 + (287.5 - 300.3125)^2] = 4 * [120.3403 + 106.8403 + 149.3403 + 163.8403] = 4 * 540.3612 = 2161.4448\n\n4. Sum of squares within treatments (SSW):\n\nSSW = [(300 - 311.25)^2 + (320 - 311.25)^2 + (315 - 311.25)^2 + (310 - 311.25)^2 + (290 - 290)^2 + (280 - 290)^2 + (300 - 290)^2 + (290 - 290)^2 + (310 - 312.5)^2 + (305 - 312.5)^2 + (315 - 312.5)^2 + (320 - 312.5)^2 + (280 - 287.5)^2 + (290 - 287.5)^2 + (285 - 287.5)^2 + (295 - 287.5)^2] = 127.5 + 76.25 + 13.75 + 1.25 + 100 + 100 + 0 + 6.25 + 56.25 + 2.5 = 483.75\n\n5. Mean square between treatments (MSB):\n\nMSB = SSB / (number of treatments - 1) = 2161.4448 / (4 - 1) = 720.4816\n\n6. Mean square within treatments (MSW):\n\nMSW = SSW / (total number of observations - number of treatments) = 483.75 / (16 - 4) = 40.3125\n\n7. F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 720.4816 / 40.3125 = 17.8816\n\n8. Critical F-value:\n\nUsing an F-distribution table for a 5% level of significance with 3 degrees of freedom for the numerator (number of treatments - 1) and 12 degrees of freedom for the denominator (total number of observations - number of treatments), we find the critical F-value to be approximately 3.49.\n\nSince the calculated F-statistic (17.8816) is greater than the critical F-value (3.49), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the mean yields of the different treatments. Therefore, there is a significant difference between the mean yields of the different treatments at a 5% level of significance."
