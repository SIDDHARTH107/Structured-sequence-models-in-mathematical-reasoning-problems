The distances between the locations are as follows: \n\n- Location A to Location B: 8 km \n- Location A to Location C: 10 km \n- Location A to Location D: 12 km \n- Location A to Location E: 6 km \n- Location B to Location C: 6 km \n- Location B to Location D: 8 km \n- Location B to Location E: 7 km \n- Location C to Location D: 5 km \n- Location C to Location E: 9 km \n- Location D to Location E: 4 km\n\nWhat is the shortest distance the driver can travel to complete all five stops, starting and ending at Location A?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate their total distances. There are 4! (4 factorial) possible routes since there are 4 locations to visit after leaving Location A, and the driver must return to Location A at the end. The 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 possible routes are:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → E → A\n2. A → B → C → E → D → A\n3. A → B → D → C → E → A\n4. A → B → D → E → C → A\n5. A → B → E → C → D → A\n6.
