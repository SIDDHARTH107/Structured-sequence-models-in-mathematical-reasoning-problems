    "message_2": "To implement the cuckoo search algorithm for the given function f(x) = x^2 over the interval (-5, 5) using 5 cuckoo birds, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization:\n- Define the number of cuckoo birds (n) as 5.\n- Define the search space as the interval (-5, 5).\n- Generate n random solutions (x_i) within the search space.\n- Calculate the fitness of each solution using f(x_i).\n\n2. Iteration:\n- Set the maximum number of iterations (T) and the current iteration (t) to 1.\n- While t <= T, repeat the following steps:\n  a. Choose a random cuckoo bird (x_i) and generate a new solution (x_new) using a random walk or Levy flight.\n  b. Ensure x_new is within the search space. If not, adjust it accordingly.\n  c. Calculate the fitness of x_new using f(x_new).\n  d. Choose a random cuckoo bird (x_j) from the population.\n  e. If the fitness of x_new is better than the fitness of x_j, replace x_j with x_new.\n  f. Find the best solution (x_best) in the current population with the lowest fitness value.\n  g. Update the population by applying a fraction (pa) of the worst solutions to be replaced by new random solutions.\n  h. Calculate the fitness of the new solutions.\n  i. Update the best solution (x_best) if any of the new solutions have a better fitness value.\n  j. Increment the current iteration (t) by 1.\n\n3. Output the best solution (x_best) and its fitness value.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the cuckoo search algorithm for the given problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2\n\ndef levy_flight():\n    return np.random.normal(0, 1)\n\ndef cuckoo_search(n, search_space, T, pa):\n    population = np.random.uniform(search_space[0], search_space[1], n)\n    fitness = np.array([f(x) for x in population])\n    \n    t = 1\n    while t <= T:\n        i = np.random.randint(n)\n        x_new = population[i] + levy_flight()\n        x_new = np.clip(x_new, search_space[0], search_space[1])\n        fitness_new = f(x_new)\n        \n        j = np.random.randint(n)\n        if fitness_new < fitness[j]:\n            population[j] = x_new\n            fitness[j] = fitness_new\n        \n        x_best = population[np.argmin(fitness)]\n        \n        worst_indices = np.argsort(fitness)[-int(n * pa):]\n        population[worst_indices] = np.random.uniform(search_space[0], search_space[1], len(worst_indices))\n        fitness[worst_indices] = np.array([f(x) for x in population[worst_indices]])\n        \n        t += 1\n    \n    return x_best, f(x_best)\n\nn = 5\nsearch_space = (-5, 5)\nT = 100\npa = 0.2\n\nx_best, min_value = cuckoo_search(n, search_space, T, pa)\nprint(f\"Minimum value of f(x) = x^2 is {min_value} at x = {x_best}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation may give slightly different results in each run due to its stochastic nature. However, it should generally find a minimum value close to 0 at x close to 0."
