    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function y = 2sin(3x), we need to analyze the coefficients of the sine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 2. Therefore, the amplitude of the function is |2| = 2.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The period of a basic sine function (y = sin(x)) is 2π. To find the period of y = 2sin(3x), we need to divide the basic period by the coefficient of the x term:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the period of the function y = 2sin(3x) is (2π) / 3 and the amplitude is 2."
