    "message_2": "Let's first find the limit of the sequence {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...}. This is a geometric sequence with the first term a = 1 and the common ratio r = 1/2. The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:\n\na_n = a * r^(n-1)\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the limit of the sequence is:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) a * r^(n-1) = lim (n -> ∞) 1 * (1/2)^(n-1)\n\nSince the common ratio r is between -1 and 1, the limit of the sequence is 0:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) 1 * (1/2)^(n-1) = 0\n\nNow, let's check if this limit is a fixed point of the function f(x) = x^2. A fixed point is a point x* such that f(x*) = x*. In this case, we want to check if f(0) = 0:\n\nf(0) = 0^2 = 0\n\nSince f(0) = 0, the limit of the sequence {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...} converges to a fixed point of the function f(x) = x^2."
