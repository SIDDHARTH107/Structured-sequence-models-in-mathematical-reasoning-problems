    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference between the Cartesian products of A and B, we first need to find the Cartesian products themselves.\n\nThe Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. Similarly, the Cartesian product B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\nB x A = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow, we find the symmetric difference between these two sets. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either one of the sets but not in both.\n\n(A x B) Δ (B x A) = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference between the Cartesian products of A and B is {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}."
