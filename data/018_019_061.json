    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference AΔB. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nIntersection of A and B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nAΔB = {0, 1, 5, 6} (elements in A or B but not in their intersection)\n\nNow, let's find the complement of set B, denoted as B'. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. Since the universal set is not provided, we can assume the universal set U is the union of A and B.\n\nU = A ∪ B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nB' = {0, 1} (elements in U but not in B)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (AΔB)ΔB':\n\n(AΔB) = {0, 1, 5, 6}\nB' = {0, 1}\n\nIntersection of (AΔB) and B' = {0, 1}\n\n(AΔB)ΔB' = {5, 6} (elements in (AΔB) or B' but not in their intersection)\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of (AΔB)ΔB' is {5, 6}."
