    "message_2": "To plot the graph of the quadratic equation y = x^2 - 4x + 3, we first need to find its vertex and roots.\n\n1. Vertex: The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nVertex (h, k) = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 3. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex (h) is:\n\nh = -(-4) / (2 * 1) = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex (k) by plugging h back into the equation:\n\nk = f(2) = (2)^2 - 4(2) + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (2, -1).\n\n2. Roots: To find the roots, we need to solve the equation x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0. We can do this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is the easiest method:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nSo, the roots of the equation are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we can plot the graph using the vertex and roots:\n\n1. Plot the vertex (2, -1).\n2. Plot the roots (1, 0) and (3, 0).\n3. Since the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive, the parabola opens upwards.\n4. Draw the parabola through the vertex and roots.\n\nThe graph of y = x^2 - 4x + 3 is a parabola with vertex (2, -1) and roots x = 1 and x = 3."
