    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5. \n\nLet G be a group of order 20. By Sylow's first theorem, there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup in G. Let n_2 and n_5 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups, respectively. By Sylow's third theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_5 divides 4 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFrom condition 1, n_2 can be either 1 or 5. From condition 2, n_5 can only be 1. \n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup. Let P_2 and P_5 be these subgroups, with orders 4 and 5, respectively. Since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is the cyclic group of order 20, i.e., G ≅ Z_20.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, P_5, with order 5. Since there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, we will analyze the structure of a Sylow 2-subgroup, P_2. The order of P_2 is 4, so it can be either isomorphic to Z_4 (cyclic group) or V_4 (Klein-4 group).\n\nCase 2.1: P_2 ≅ Z_4\nIn this case, G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, P_5, and a Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to Z_4. Since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is the cyclic group of order 20, i.e., G ≅ Z_20. This is the same as Case 1.\n\nCase 2.2: P_2 ≅ V_4\nIn this case, G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, P_5, and a Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to V_4. Since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are coprime, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_2 and P_5. As there is only one non-trivial automorphism of P_5, there is only one possible semidirect product, which is the dihedral group of order 20, i.e., G ≅ D_20.\n\nIn conclusion, there are exactly three distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 20: Z_20\n2. The dihedral group of order 20: D_20\n3. The direct product of Z_4 and Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_20 (same as case 1)\n\nSo, there are 2 distinct isomorphism classes: Z_20 and D_20."
