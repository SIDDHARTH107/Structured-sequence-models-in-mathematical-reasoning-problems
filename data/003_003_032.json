    "message_2": "To find the sine of an angle in radians, we can use the unit circle. The sine of an angle is the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.\n\nThe angle 5π/6 is in the second quadrant, where the sine values are positive. We can find a reference angle in the first quadrant that has the same sine value. The reference angle for 5π/6 is:\n\nπ/2 - 5π/6 = (3π - 5π)/6 = -π/3\n\nSince the sine function is an odd function, sin(-x) = -sin(x). Therefore, sin(-π/3) = -sin(π/3).\n\nNow, we know that sin(π/3) = √3/2. So, sin(-π/3) = -√3/2.\n\nSince the angle 5π/6 is in the second quadrant, where the sine values are positive, the sine of 5π/6 is the opposite of sin(-π/3):\n\nsin(5π/6) = -(-√3/2) = √3/2"
