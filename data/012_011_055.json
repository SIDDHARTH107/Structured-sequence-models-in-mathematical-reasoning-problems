    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also called an articulation point) is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph, keeping track of the discovery time of each vertex and the lowest discovery time reachable from each vertex.\n2. During the DFS, for each vertex v, if v is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, then v is a cut vertex.\n3. For each non-root vertex v, if the lowest discovery time reachable from any of its children is greater than or equal to the discovery time of v, then v is a cut vertex.\n4. For each edge (u, v), if the lowest discovery time reachable from v is greater than the discovery time of u, then (u, v) is a bridge.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given graph, we get the following discovery times and lowest reachable discovery times:\n\n```\nVertex | Discovery Time | Lowest Reachable Time\n-----------------------------------------------\n1      |       1        |          1\n2      |       2        |          1\n3      |       3        |          1\n4      |       4        |          4\n5      |       5        |          5\n```\n\nNow, we can identify the cut vertices and bridges:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is the root of the DFS tree and has two children (2 and 3), so it is a cut vertex.\n2. Vertex 2 is not the root, and the lowest reachable time from its child (3) is 1, which is less than its discovery time (2), so it is not a cut vertex.\n3. Vertex 3 is not the root, and the lowest reachable time from its child (4) is 4, which is greater than its discovery time (3), so it is a cut vertex.\n4. Vertex 4 is not the root, and the lowest reachable time from its child (5) is 5, which is greater than its discovery time (4), so it is a cut vertex.\n5. Vertex 5 is not the root and has no children, so it is not a cut vertex.\n\nThe cut vertices are {1, 3, 4}.\n\nFor the bridges, we can see that the edge (4, 5) has a lowest reachable time from vertex 5 (5) greater than the discovery time of vertex 4 (4), so (4, 5) is a bridge. No other edges meet this condition.\n\nThe bridges are {(4, 5)}."
