    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection associated with the standard metric $g = dx \\otimes dx + dy \\otimes dy$. The Christoffel symbols are given by:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$$\n\nSince the metric is the standard Euclidean metric, its components are $g_{11} = 1$, $g_{22} = 1$, and $g_{12} = g_{21} = 0$. The inverse metric is also the standard Euclidean metric, so its components are $g^{11} = 1$, $g^{22} = 1$, and $g^{12} = g^{21} = 0$. \n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric is constant, all its partial derivatives are zero. Therefore, all the Christoffel symbols are also zero:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$$\n\nNow, we can compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$. The covariant derivative of a (1,1)-tensor field is given by:\n\n$$(\\nabla_i T^j_k) = \\partial_i T^j_k + \\Gamma^j_{il} T^l_k - \\Gamma^l_{ik} T^j_l$$\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols are zero, this simplifies to:\n\n$$(\\nabla_i T^j_k) = \\partial_i T^j_k$$\n\nNow, we can compute the partial derivatives of the components of $T$. We have:\n\n$$T^{1}_{1} = 2x^2y, \\quad T^{2}_{2} = 3xy^2, \\quad T^{1}_{2} = T^{2}_{1} = 0$$\n\nTaking the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$\\partial_1 T^1_1 = 4xy, \\quad \\partial_2 T^1_1 = 2x^2$$\n$$\\partial_1 T^2_2 = 3y^2, \\quad \\partial_2 T^2_2 = 6xy$$\n\nSince $T^{1}_{2} = T^{2}_{1} = 0$, their partial derivatives are also zero:\n\n$$\\partial_1 T^1_2 = \\partial_2 T^1_2 = \\partial_1 T^2_1 = \\partial_2 T^2_1 = 0$$\n\nThus, the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of the standard metric is:\n\n$$\\nabla T = 4xy \\partial_1 \\otimes \\partial_x \\otimes \\partial_x + 2x^2 \\partial_2 \\otimes \\partial_x \\otimes \\partial_x + 3y^2 \\partial_1 \\otimes \\partial_y \\otimes \\partial_y + 6xy \\partial_2 \\otimes \\partial_y \\otimes \\partial_y$$"
