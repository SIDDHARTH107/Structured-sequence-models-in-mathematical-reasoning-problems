    "message_1": "A seller wants to sell an object to one of two potential buyers. The object has a value of $100 to buyer 1 and a value of $150 to buyer 2. Each buyer knows his own value but not the other buyer's. The seller can use a mechanism to ask for bids from the buyers, and the highest bidder will get the object. However, the seller wants to maximize his revenue. Given that the buyers can't communicate, what mechanism should the seller use and what is the expected revenue from this mechanism?",
    "message_2": "The seller should use a second-price sealed-bid auction (also known as a Vickrey auction) to maximize his revenue. In this mechanism, each buyer submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the object but pays the second-highest bid price.\n\nIn this auction, it is a weakly dominant strategy for each buyer to bid their true valuation of the object. This is because bidding their true value ensures that they will not overpay for the object and will only win the auction if it is in their best interest.\n\nLet's analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1. Buyer 1 bids $100, and Buyer 2 bids $150. Buyer 2 wins the auction and pays $100.\n2. Buyer 1 bids less than $100, and Buyer 2 bids $150. Buyer 2 still wins the auction and pays the amount that Buyer 1 bid, which is less than $100.\n3. Buyer 1 bids $100, and Buyer 2 bids less than $150 but more than $100. Buyer 2 wins the auction and pays $100.\n4. Buyer 1 bids less than $100, and Buyer 2 bids less than $150 but more than Buyer 1's bid. Buyer 2 wins the auction and pays the amount that Buyer 1 bid, which is less than $100.\n\nIn all cases, Buyer 2 wins the auction, and the seller's revenue is either $100 or less than $100. The expected revenue for the seller in this mechanism is $100, as it is the highest possible revenue they can obtain given the buyers' valuations and the second-price sealed-bid auction mechanism."
