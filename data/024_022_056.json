    "message_1": "Let M be a surface of revolution with metric \\\\(ds^2 = dr^2 + f(r)^2d\\theta^2\\\\), where \\\\(f(r)\\\\) is a positive function of \\\\(r\\\\) and the coordinate \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is periodic with period \\\\(2\\pi\\\\). Suppose that M is equipped with its natural Riemannian structure. Find all isometries of M.",
    "message_2": "To find the isometries of M, we need to find all transformations that preserve the metric. Let's consider a transformation T: (r, θ) → (R(r, θ), Θ(r, θ)). The transformed metric under T is given by:\n\n\\\\(ds'^2 = (dR/dr)^2 dr^2 + (dR/d\\theta)^2 d\\theta^2 + (d\\Theta/dr)^2 dr^2 + (d\\Theta/d\\theta)^2 d\\theta^2\\\\)\n\nNow, we want to find the transformations T such that \\\\(ds'^2 = ds^2\\\\). This means that:\n\n1. \\\\((dR/dr)^2 + (d\\Theta/dr)^2 = 1\\\\)\n2. \\\\((dR/d\\theta)^2 + (d\\Theta/d\\theta)^2 = f(r)^2\\\\)\n3. \\\\(dR/dr * dR/d\\theta + d\\Theta/dr * d\\Theta/d\\theta = 0\\\\)\n\nFrom equation (1), we can see that the transformation T must be a rotation in the (r, θ) plane. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: Rotation around the r-axis\nIn this case, the transformation T is given by:\n\n\\\\(R(r, \\theta) = r\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Theta(r, \\theta) = \\theta + \\alpha\\\\)\n\nwhere α is a constant. This transformation clearly satisfies equations (1), (2), and (3), so it is an isometry of M.\n\nCase 2: Rotation around the θ-axis\nIn this case, the transformation T is given by:\n\n\\\\(R(r, \\theta) = r\\cos(\\beta) + f(r)\\sin(\\beta)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Theta(r, \\theta) = \\theta + \\arctan(\\frac{r\\sin(\\beta)}{f(r) - r\\cos(\\beta)})\\\\)\n\nwhere β is a constant. This transformation also satisfies equations (1), (2), and (3), so it is an isometry of M.\n\nIn conclusion, the isometries of M are given by rotations around the r-axis and rotations around the θ-axis."
