    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 12, which has prime factorization 2^2 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The intersection of P and Q is trivial, as their orders are coprime. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C4 x C3. This group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. Since Q is unique, it is normal in G. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. The intersection of P and Q is trivial, as their orders are coprime. Thus, G is a semi-direct product of P and Q. Since Q is normal, we have a homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(P). The automorphism group of P is isomorphic to either C2 (if P is isomorphic to C4) or D2 (if P is isomorphic to V4, the Klein four-group). In either case, there is only one non-trivial automorphism, which is inversion. Therefore, there are two possible semi-direct products: one where φ is trivial (which gives the direct product C4 x C3, as in Case 1), and one where φ is non-trivial. In the latter case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, neither P nor Q is normal in G. However, the product of two 3-cycles in S4 is a 3-cycle, so the set of all 3-cycles forms a subgroup of S4. This subgroup has order 8, which is the same as the index of the Sylow 2-subgroups in G. By the correspondence theorem, there is a subgroup H of G that corresponds to the set of 3-cycles in S4. The group H has order 12 and contains all three Sylow 2-subgroups of G, so G must be isomorphic to H. Since H is isomorphic to the alternating group A4, G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
