    "message_1": "Sorry, but paraconsistent logic doesn't deal with numerical problems, as it is a type of logic that allows for contradictions to exist without leading to all statements becoming true. It is used in philosophy and computer science. Can I help you with a different type of math problem?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Please provide the math problem you'd like me to solve, and I'll be happy to help."
