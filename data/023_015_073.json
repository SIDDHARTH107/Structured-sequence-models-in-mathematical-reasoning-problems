    "message_1": "A guitar string has a tension of 100 N and a length of 0.75 meters. If the mass of the string is 0.003 kg, what is the fundamental frequency of the string? Use the Fourier transform to solve the wave propagation problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental frequency of the string, we can use the formula:\n\nf = (1/2L) * sqrt(T/μ)\n\nwhere f is the fundamental frequency, L is the length of the string, T is the tension, and μ is the linear mass density of the string.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the string. We can do this by dividing the mass of the string by its length:\n\nμ = mass / length\nμ = 0.003 kg / 0.75 m\nμ = 0.004 kg/m\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nf = (1/(2 * 0.75 m)) * sqrt(100 N / 0.004 kg/m)\nf = (1/1.5 m) * sqrt(25000 m²/s²)\nf = (2/3) * 50 Hz\n\nf = 100/3 Hz\n\nThe fundamental frequency of the string is approximately 33.33 Hz."
