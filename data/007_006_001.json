    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 96 and 360 using the Euclidean algorithm, we will perform a series of divisions and remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (360) by the smaller number (96) and find the remainder.\n   360 รท 96 = 3 (remainder 72)\n\n2. Replace the larger number (360) with the smaller number (96) and the smaller number with the remainder (72), then repeat step 1.\n   96 รท 72 = 1 (remainder 24)\n\n3. Replace the larger number (96) with the smaller number (72) and the smaller number with the remainder (24), then repeat step 1.\n   72 รท 24 = 3 (remainder 0)\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 24. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 96 and 360 is 24."
