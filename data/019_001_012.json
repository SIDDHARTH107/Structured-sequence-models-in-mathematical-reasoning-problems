    "message_1": "Consider the propositional logic statement \"If it rains today, then I will stay indoors.\" If it rained on 4 days out of the month, and on 2 of those days you stayed indoors, what is the truth value of the statement?",
    "message_2": "The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P represents \"it rains today\" and Q represents \"I will stay indoors.\" \n\nTo determine the truth value of the statement, we need to examine the cases when it rained (P is true) and whether you stayed indoors (Q is true) or not.\n\nOut of the 4 days it rained, you stayed indoors on 2 days (P is true, Q is true) and went outdoors on the other 2 days (P is true, Q is false). \n\nA conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is considered false only when P is true and Q is false. Since there are 2 days when it rained and you went outdoors, the statement is false in those cases. Therefore, the overall truth value of the statement is false."
