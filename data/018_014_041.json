    "message_2": "First, let's find the complements of sets A and B. Since no universal set is given, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B. So, U = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nNow, we can find the complements of A and B:\nAc = U - A = {3, 4}\nBc = U - B = {1, 2}\n\nNext, we will find the Cartesian products:\nAc x Bc = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\nA x Bc = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\nNow, we can find the union of these Cartesian products:\n(Ac x Bc) U (A x Bc) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\nNext, we will find the Cartesian product A x B:\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, we can find the union of Ac x Bc and A x B:\n(Ac x Bc) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nComparing the two unions, we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(Ac x Bc) U (A x Bc) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n(Ac x Bc) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of (Ac x Bc) U (A x Bc) is not equal to (Ac x Bc) U (A x B)."
