    "message_2": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be a, and the common difference be d. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:\n\nSum = (n * (2a + (n - 1)d)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms in the sequence.\n\nFor the first 10 terms, we have:\n\n200 = (10 * (2a + (10 - 1)d)) / 2\n\nFor the next 10 terms, the first term will be a + 10d, and the number of terms is still 10. So, we have:\n\n300 = (10 * (2(a + 10d) + (10 - 1)d)) / 2\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables, a and d:\n\n1) 200 = 10 * (2a + 9d)\n2) 300 = 10 * (2a + 29d)\n\nSimplify both equations:\n\n1) 20 = 2a + 9d\n2) 30 = 2a + 29d\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate variable a:\n\n10 = 20d\n\nNow, solve for d:\n\nd = 10 / 20\nd = 1/2\n\nThe common difference of the arithmetic sequence is 1/2."
