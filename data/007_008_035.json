    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 7^13 is divided by 17. Since 17 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^17 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we can rewrite 7^13 as (7^17) * (7^-4). Using the property of modular arithmetic:\n\n(7^17) * (7^-4) ≡ 7 * (7^-4) (mod 17)\n\nSince 7^17 ≡ 7 (mod 17), we can simplify the equation:\n\n7 * (7^-4) ≡ 7 * (7^-4) (mod 17)\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of 7^4 (mod 17). We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse, but in this case, we can find it by trial and error:\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n7^3 ≡ 7 * 15 ≡ 105 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the modular inverse of 7^4 (mod 17) is 7^3 (mod 17):\n\n7 * (7^-4) ≡ 7 * (7^3) (mod 17)\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 7^3:\n\n7^4 ≡ 7^4 (mod 17)\n\nFinally, we can find the remainder when 7^13 is divided by 17:\n\n7^13 ≡ 7^4 (mod 17) ≡ 2401 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^13 is divided by 17 is 3."
