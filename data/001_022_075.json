    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 10x, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0.\n\n0 = x^3 - 7x^2 + 10x\n\nFirst, we can factor out an x from each term:\n\n0 = x(x^2 - 7x + 10)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression:\n\n0 = x(x - 2)(x - 5)\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are the values of x that make this equation true:\n\nx(x - 2)(x - 5) = 0\n\nThere are three possible solutions:\n\n1) x = 0\n2) x - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n3) x - 5 = 0 => x = 5\n\nThus, the x-intercepts are x = 0, x = 2, and x = 5."
