    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. A unit of A requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor while a unit of B requires 2 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor. The factory can use up to 50 machine hours and 35 labor hours every day. If the factory can sell A for $10 per unit and B for $8 per unit, how many units of each product should be produced each day to maximize revenue using mixed-integer programming?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using mixed-integer programming, we need to formulate the problem as a linear programming problem with integer constraints. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced each day.\n\nObjective function (Revenue to be maximized):\nRevenue = 10x + 8y\n\nConstraints (Machine and labor hours):\n3x + 2y ≤ 50 (Machine hours)\n2x + 2y ≤ 35 (Labor hours)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity)\nx, y ∈ integers (Mixed-integer constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this mixed-integer linear programming problem using any standard solver (e.g., branch and bound method, cutting plane method, or software like Gurobi, CPLEX, or GLPK).\n\nThe optimal solution is x = 10 units of product A and y = 7.5 units of product B. However, since we have a mixed-integer constraint, we need to round y to the nearest integer. In this case, we can round down to y = 7 or round up to y = 8 and check which one gives a higher revenue.\n\nCase 1: y = 7\nRevenue = 10(10) + 8(7) = 100 + 56 = $156\n\nCase 2: y = 8\nTo produce 8 units of product B, we need 16 labor hours. This leaves us with 35 - 16 = 19 labor hours for product A, which means we can produce at most 9.5 units of product A. Since we need to round down to an integer, we can produce 9 units of product A.\nRevenue = 10(9) + 8(8) = 90 + 64 = $154\n\nComparing the two cases, we can see that producing 10 units of product A and 7 units of product B gives a higher revenue of $156. Therefore, the factory should produce 10 units of product A and 7 units of product B each day to maximize revenue."
