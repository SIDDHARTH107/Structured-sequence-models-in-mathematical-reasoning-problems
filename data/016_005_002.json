The Cantor set is created after an infinite number of iterations.)",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the number of line segments at each iteration:\n\n1. Iteration 1: We start with a single line segment of length 1. So, there is 1 line segment.\n2. Iteration 2: We remove the middle third of the line segment, leaving two segments of length 1/3 each. So, there are 2 line segments.\n3. Iteration 3: We remove the middle third of each of the 2 line segments from the previous iteration, leaving 2 * 2 = 4 line segments of length 1/9 each.\n4. Iteration 4: We remove the middle third of each of the 4 line segments from the previous iteration, leaving 2 * 4 = 8 line segments of length 1/27 each.\n\nSo, after the first 4 iterations, there are a total of 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 line segments."
