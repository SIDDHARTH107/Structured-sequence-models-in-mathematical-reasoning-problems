    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C24.\n2. G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5.\n3. G is isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nWe will analyze each case separately.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C24.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C24, then G must have an element of order 24. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G must divide 8 (since 24 = 2^3 * 3) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibilities are 1 and 4. If there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2, so there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, which must also be normal in G. If both the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are normal, then their product forms a subgroup of order 24, which must be the entire group G. Thus, G is a semi-direct product of its 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups. Since both subgroups are cyclic, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C24.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5.\n\nThe order of A5 is 60, which is not equal to 24. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A5.\n\nCase 3: G is isomorphic to one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nThe five non-abelian groups of order 24 are:\n\n1. The symmetric group S4.\n2. The dihedral group D12.\n3. The semi-direct product of C2 x C2 with C6.\n4. The semi-direct product of C4 with C6.\n5. The semi-direct product of C2 x C2 with C3 x C2.\n\nEach of these groups has a different structure, but they all have order 24. To determine if G is isomorphic to one of these groups, we can analyze the structure of G's subgroups and compare them to the structures of these non-abelian groups.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C24 or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the structure of G's subgroups."
