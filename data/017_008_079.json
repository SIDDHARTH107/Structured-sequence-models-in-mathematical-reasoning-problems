    "message_2": "There are five groups of order 8 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8. This group is generated by a single element, say a, and has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}. The group operation is multiplication modulo 8.\n\n2. Q8: The quaternion group of order 8. This group has elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} with the following multiplication rules: i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. Q8 is a non-abelian group.\n\n3. D4: The dihedral group of order 8. This group represents the symmetries of a square and has elements {1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r is a rotation by 90 degrees and s is a reflection. D4 is also a non-abelian group.\n\n4. C4 x C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2. This group has elements {(1,1), (a,1), (a^2,1), (a^3,1), (1,b), (a,b), (a^2,b), (a^3,b)}, where a has order 4 and b has order 2. This is an abelian group.\n\n5. C2 x C2 x C2: The direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2. This group has elements {(1,1,1), (a,1,1), (1,b,1), (1,1,c), (a,b,1), (a,1,c), (1,b,c), (a,b,c)}, where a, b, and c have order 2. This is also an abelian group.\n\nNow, let's identify which ones are isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4:\n\n- C8 is isomorphic to itself.\n- Q8 is isomorphic to itself.\n- D4 is isomorphic to itself.\n\nThe other two groups, C4 x C2 and C2 x C2 x C2, are not isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4."
