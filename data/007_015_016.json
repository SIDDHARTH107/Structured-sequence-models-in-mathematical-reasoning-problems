    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, and so on.\n\nTo find the 8th Mersenne prime, we need to find the first 8 prime numbers for n and then calculate the corresponding Mersenne primes. The first 8 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, and 31.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Mersenne primes for these values of n:\n\n1. M_2 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\n2. M_3 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\n3. M_5 = 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31\n4. M_7 = 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127\n5. M_13 = 2^13 - 1 = 8192 - 1 = 8191\n6. M_17 = 2^17 - 1 = 131072 - 1 = 131071\n7. M_19 = 2^19 - 1 = 524288 - 1 = 524287\n8. M_31 = 2^31 - 1 = 2147483648 - 1 = 2147483647\n\nSo, the 8th Mersenne prime number is 2,147,483,647."
