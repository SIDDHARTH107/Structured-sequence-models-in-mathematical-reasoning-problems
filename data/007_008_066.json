    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a such that 0 < a < p, the following equation holds:\n\na^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nNow, let's use this theorem to find the remainder when a prime number p is divided by 3. Since p is greater than 3, we can choose a = 2.\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n2^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when p is divided by 3, so we need to consider the equation (mod 3). We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(2^(p-1) - 1) ≡ 0 (mod p)\n\nSince p is a prime number, it cannot be divisible by 2. Therefore, p must be odd. Let p = 2k + 1, where k is an integer. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(2^(2k) - 1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)\n\nNow, we can use the property of modular arithmetic that (a * b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n. So, we have:\n\n((2^k) % 3)^2 - 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3)\n\nWe can check the possible values of (2^k) % 3:\n\n- If k = 1, (2^k) % 3 = 2 % 3 = 2\n- If k = 2, (2^k) % 3 = 4 % 3 = 1\n- If k = 3, (2^k) % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2\n- If k = 4, (2^k) % 3 = 16 % 3 = 1\n\nWe can see that (2^k) % 3 alternates between 1 and 2. Therefore, ((2^k) % 3)^2 - 1 can take the values:\n\n- If (2^k) % 3 = 1, ((2^k) % 3)^2 - 1 = 0\n- If (2^k) % 3 = 2, ((2^k) % 3)^2 - 1 = 3\n\nSo, we have two possible cases:\n\n1. ((2^k) % 3)^2 - 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3), which means p ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. ((2^k) % 3)^2 - 1 ≡ 3 (mod 3), which means p ≡ 2 (mod 3)\n\nIn conclusion, when a prime number p greater than 3 is divided by 3, the remainder can be either 1 or 2."
