    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the moduli space Mg of algebraic curves of genus 3, we can use the formula for the dimension of the moduli space of curves of genus g:\n\ndim(Mg) = 3g - 3\n\nIn this case, g = 3, so the formula becomes:\n\ndim(M3) = 3(3) - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6\n\nSo, the dimension of the moduli space M3 of algebraic curves of genus 3 is 6.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of irreducible components of M3. For genus g â‰¥ 2, the moduli space Mg is irreducible. Since g = 3 in this case, the moduli space M3 is irreducible. Therefore, the number of irreducible components of M3 is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the dimension of the moduli space M3 of algebraic curves of genus 3 is 6, and it has 1 irreducible component."
