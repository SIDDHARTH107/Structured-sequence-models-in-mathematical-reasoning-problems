    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the total surface area of the cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 faces).\n\nThe area of a square can be found using the formula: Area = side × side\n\nIn this case, the side length of each face is 5 cm. So, the area of one face is:\n\nArea = 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 square centimeters\n\nNow, to find the total surface area of the cube, we multiply the area of one face by 6:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 6 × 25 square centimeters = 150 square centimeters\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
