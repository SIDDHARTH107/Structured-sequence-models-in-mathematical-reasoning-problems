    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\nLet's find the sum of the digits of 123456789:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45\n\nNow, we can see that the sum of the digits (45) is divisible by 9, as 45 รท 9 = 5. Therefore, 123456789 is also divisible by 9, and the remainder when 123456789 is divided by 9 is 0."
