    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + a * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = a * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = b - 0.4 * (2 / pi) * atan(y_n / x_n).\n\nTo compute the Lyapunov exponent, we need to calculate the average rate of divergence of nearby trajectories in the phase space. This can be done using the Jacobian matrix of the map and iterating it over a large number of steps.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J of the Ikeda map is given by:\n\nJ = | ∂x_{n+1}/∂x_n  ∂x_{n+1}/∂y_n |\n    | ∂y_{n+1}/∂x_n  ∂y_{n+1}/∂y_n |\n\nAfter calculating the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ = | a * cos(t_n)  -a * sin(t_n) |\n    | a * sin(t_n)   a * cos(t_n) |\n\nTo compute the Lyapunov exponent, we need to iterate the Ikeda map and its Jacobian matrix for a large number of steps, say N, and calculate the average logarithm of the Jacobian's norm:\n\nLyapunov exponent = (1/N) * Σ(log(||J_n||))\n\nwhere ||J_n|| is the norm of the Jacobian matrix at step n.\n\nTo find the Lyapunov exponent for the given parameter values a=0.9184 and b=0.9, you would need to perform these calculations numerically using a programming language or software like Python, MATLAB, or Mathematica.\n\nKeep in mind that the Lyapunov exponent can be sensitive to initial conditions, so it's a good idea to discard a number of initial steps (transients) before starting the calculation and to average the results over several different initial conditions."
