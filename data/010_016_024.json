    "message_2": "Poincaré duality states that for a compact, connected, and oriented n-dimensional manifold M, the homology groups H_k(M) are isomorphic to the cohomology groups H^{n-k}(M) for all k. In our case, X is a 3-dimensional manifold, so we have the following isomorphisms:\n\nH_0(X) ≅ H^3(X)\nH_1(X) ≅ H^2(X)\nH_2(X) ≅ H^1(X)\nH_3(X) ≅ H^0(X)\n\nWe are given that H_1(X) ≅ Z/2Z and H_2(X) ≅ Z. Since X is connected, H_0(X) ≅ Z. Using Poincaré duality, we can find the corresponding cohomology groups:\n\nH^3(X) ≅ H_0(X) ≅ Z\nH^2(X) ≅ H_1(X) ≅ Z/2Z\nH^1(X) ≅ H_2(X) ≅ Z\nH^0(X) ≅ H_3(X)\n\nNow, we want to compute the rank of H_3(X, ∂X). To do this, we will use the long exact sequence of the pair (X, ∂X):\n\n... → H_3(∂X) → H_3(X) → H_3(X, ∂X) → H_2(∂X) → H_2(X) → ...\n\nSince X is a 3-dimensional manifold, its boundary ∂X is a 2-dimensional manifold. Therefore, H_3(∂X) = 0. We also know that H_2(X) ≅ Z and H_2(∂X) is a free abelian group (as it is a 2-dimensional manifold). Let r be the rank of H_2(∂X).\n\nThe long exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → H_3(X) → H_3(X, ∂X) → Z^r → Z → ...\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the connecting homomorphism in the long exact sequence maps H_3(X, ∂X) onto the kernel of the next map. Since the next map is onto (it is a surjective homomorphism from Z^r to Z), its kernel is isomorphic to Z^(r-1). Therefore, we have:\n\nH_3(X) ≅ H_3(X, ∂X) / Z^(r-1)\n\nSince H^0(X) ≅ H_3(X), we have:\n\nZ ≅ H_3(X, ∂X) / Z^(r-1)\n\nThis implies that H_3(X, ∂X) is a free abelian group of rank r. Thus, the rank of H_3(X, ∂X) is r."
