    "message_1": "An engineering company wants to minimize the cost of producing a steel beam that can support a maximum load of 5000 pounds. The cost of producing the beam depends on two variables: the width of the beam and the height of the beam. The cost function of the beam is given by:\n\nC(x,y) = 6x^2 + 3y^2 + 2xy\n\nwhere x is the width of the beam and y is the height of the beam.\n\nUsing Firefly Algorithm, what is the minimum cost of producing the steel beam that can support a maximum load of 5000 pounds?",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. In this case, we want to find the minimum cost of producing a steel beam that can support a maximum load of 5000 pounds.\n\nTo use the Firefly Algorithm, we need to define the objective function, which is the cost function C(x, y) in this case. We also need to set the parameters for the algorithm, such as the number of fireflies, the number of iterations, and the step size.\n\nLet's assume we have set the parameters and run the Firefly Algorithm. The algorithm will search for the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost function C(x, y). After running the algorithm, we will obtain the optimal values of x and y, which we can plug into the cost function to find the minimum cost.\n\nHowever, as a mathematician, I cannot run the Firefly Algorithm directly. You would need to implement the algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB and run it with the given cost function and parameters to find the minimum cost.\n\nOnce you have the optimal values of x and y, you can plug them into the cost function C(x, y) to find the minimum cost of producing the steel beam that can support a maximum load of 5000 pounds."
