    "message_1": "A local bakery wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain type of cake. The cost function for producing n cakes is given by C(n) = 50n + 0.1n^3, where C(n) is the cost in dollars. However, the bakery can only produce a maximum of 20 cakes per day. What is the minimum cost for producing these cakes?",
    "message_2": "Since the bakery can only produce a maximum of 20 cakes per day, we need to find the cost of producing 20 cakes using the given cost function.\n\nC(n) = 50n + 0.1n^3\n\nPlug in n = 20:\n\nC(20) = 50(20) + 0.1(20)^3\nC(20) = 1000 + 0.1(8000)\nC(20) = 1000 + 800\nC(20) = 1800\n\nThe minimum cost for producing 20 cakes is $1800."
