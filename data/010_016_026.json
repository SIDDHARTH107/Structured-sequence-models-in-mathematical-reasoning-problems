    "message_2": "In intersection theory, the intersection number of two submanifolds C and D in a space X is denoted by C ∩ D. Poincaré duality states that the intersection number is equal to the evaluation of the cup product of the cohomology classes of the submanifolds on the fundamental class of the space X.\n\nLet [C] and [D] be the cohomology classes of C and D, respectively, and [X] be the fundamental class of X. Then, according to Poincaré duality, we have:\n\nC ∩ D = ⟨[C] ∪ [D], [X]⟩\n\nHowever, to compute the value of the pairing C ∩ D, we need more information about the space X, the dimensions of C and D, and their cohomology classes. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact value of C ∩ D.\n\nIt's important to note that the fact that C intersects D at exactly 5 points does not necessarily imply that the intersection number C ∩ D is equal to 5. The intersection number takes into account the orientation of the submanifolds and can be positive, negative, or zero at each intersection point. The sum of these signed intersection points gives the intersection number C ∩ D."
