    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on the top of a building. A person standing at a distance of 30 meters from the building estimates that the angle of elevation of the top of the pole is 60 degrees. Find the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the height of the flagpole as h. In this problem, we have a right triangle formed by the person, the base of the building, and the top of the flagpole. The angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the distance from the person to the building is 30 meters, and we want to find the height (h) of the flagpole.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 30\n\nTo find the height, we need to solve for h:\n\nh = 30 * tan(60°)\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is √3, so:\n\nh = 30 * √3\n\nh ≈ 30 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 51.96\n\nTherefore, the height of the flagpole is approximately 51.96 meters."
