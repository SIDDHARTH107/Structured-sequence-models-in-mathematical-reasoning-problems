    "message_2": "A is both connected and path-connected.\n\nFirst, let's show that A is path-connected. To do this, we need to show that for any two points in A, there exists a continuous path between them that lies entirely within A.\n\nLet p = (x1, y1) and q = (x2, y2) be two arbitrary points in A. Since x1² + y1² ≤ 1 and x2² + y2² ≤ 1, both points lie within the closed unit disk centered at the origin.\n\nNow, consider the straight line segment between p and q. We can parameterize this line segment by the function:\n\nf(t) = (1-t)p + tq = ((1-t)x1 + tx2, (1-t)y1 + ty2)\n\nfor t ∈ [0, 1]. We need to show that f(t) ∈ A for all t ∈ [0, 1]. In other words, we need to show that the straight line segment between p and q lies entirely within the closed unit disk.\n\nLet's compute the squared distance from f(t) to the origin:\n\n||f(t)||² = ((1-t)x1 + tx2)² + ((1-t)y1 + ty2)²\n          = (1-t)²(x1² + y1²) + 2t(1-t)(x1x2 + y1y2) + t²(x2² + y2²)\n\nSince x1² + y1² ≤ 1 and x2² + y2² ≤ 1, we know that:\n\n||f(t)||² ≤ (1-t)² + 2t(1-t)(x1x2 + y1y2) + t²\n\nNow, we need to show that ||f(t)||² ≤ 1 for all t ∈ [0, 1]. To do this, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n\n(x1x2 + y1y2)² ≤ (x1² + y1²)(x2² + y2²) ≤ 1\n\nSo, we have:\n\n||f(t)||² ≤ (1-t)² + 2t(1-t)(x1x2 + y1y2) + t² ≤ (1-t)² + 2t(1-t) + t² = 1\n\nThus, f(t) ∈ A for all t ∈ [0, 1], and A is path-connected.\n\nNow, let's show that A is connected. Since path-connectedness implies connectedness, we can conclude that A is connected because we have already shown that A is path-connected.\n\nTherefore, A is both connected and path-connected."
