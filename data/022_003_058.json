    "message_2": "To compute the integral $\\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{e^{z}}{z-2i} dz$, we can use the Cauchy Integral Formula. The Cauchy Integral Formula states that if $f(z)$ is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour $\\gamma$ and $z_0$ is any point inside $\\gamma$, then\n\n$$f(z_0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} dz$$\n\nIn our case, $f(z) = e^z$, which is an entire function (analytic everywhere), and $z_0 = 2i$. Thus, we can rewrite the integral as\n\n$$\\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{e^{z}}{z-2i} dz = 2\\pi i e^{2i}$$\n\nSo, the integral evaluates to\n\n$$\\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{e^{z}}{z-2i} dz = 2\\pi i e^{2i}$$"
