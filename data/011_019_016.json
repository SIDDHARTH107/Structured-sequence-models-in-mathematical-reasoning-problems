    "message_2": "An L16(2^(4-1)) orthogonal array is a 16-run experiment with 4 factors, each having 2 levels (high and low). The array is designed in such a way that each factor combination appears an equal number of times, and the factor effects can be estimated independently.\n\nHere's the L16(2^(4-1)) orthogonal array for the experiment:\n\nRun | Factor A | Factor B | Factor C | Factor D\n----|----------|----------|----------|----------\n 1  |    Low   |    Low   |    Low   |    Low\n 2  |    Low   |    Low   |    Low   |   High\n 3  |    Low   |    Low   |   High   |    Low\n 4  |    Low   |    Low   |   High   |   High\n 5  |    Low   |   High   |    Low   |    Low\n 6  |    Low   |   High   |    Low   |   High\n 7  |    Low   |   High   |   High   |    Low\n 8  |    Low   |   High   |   High   |   High\n 9  |   High   |    Low   |    Low   |    Low\n10  |   High   |    Low   |    Low   |   High\n11  |   High   |    Low   |   High   |    Low\n12  |   High   |    Low   |   High   |   High\n13  |   High   |   High   |    Low   |    Low\n14  |   High   |   High   |    Low   |   High\n15  |   High   |   High   |   High   |    Low\n16  |   High   |   High   |   High   |   High\n\nIn this array, each factor combination appears exactly once, and the factor effects can be estimated independently. The factory can use this design to conduct the experiment and analyze the effects of factors A, B, C, and D on the yield of the chemical reaction."
