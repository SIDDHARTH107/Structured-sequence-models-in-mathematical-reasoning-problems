    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\nc(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nThe reaction-diffusion equation is given by:\n\n∂c/∂t = D(∂²c/∂x² + ∂²c/∂y²) - kc\n\nPlugging in the separated solution, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)∂T/∂t = D(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)) - kX(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t), we obtain:\n\n(1/T)∂T/∂t = D(1/X)X''(x) + D(1/Y)Y''(y) - k\n\nNow, we set each term equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1/T)∂T/∂t = -λ\n(1/X)X''(x) = -λ/D\n(1/Y)Y''(y) = -λ/D + k/D\n\nSolving the ODEs, we have:\n\nT(t) = e^(-λt)\nX(x) = A*cos(√(λ/D)x) + B*sin(√(λ/D)x)\nY(y) = C*cos(√(λ/D - k/D)y) + D*sin(√(λ/D - k/D)y)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nc(0, y, t) = c(2, y, t) = 0 => X(0) = X(2) = 0\nc(x, 0, t) = c(x, 2, t) = 0 => Y(0) = Y(2) = 0\n\nThis implies that A = 0 and C = 0, and we get:\n\nX(x) = B*sin(√(λ/D)x)\nY(y) = D*sin(√(λ/D - k/D)y)\n\nThe initial condition is given by:\n\nc(x, y, 0) = sin(πx) sin(πy)\n\nComparing this with the separated solution, we can see that:\n\n√(λ/D) = π => λ = π²\n√(λ/D - k/D) = π => λ - k = π² => λ = π² + 2\n\nSince λ = π², we have:\n\nX(x) = B*sin(πx)\nY(y) = D*sin(πy)\n\nNow, we can find the concentration at time t=1:\n\nc(x, y, 1) = X(x)Y(y)T(1) = B*D*sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-π²)\n\nTo find the constants B and D, we can use the initial condition:\n\nsin(πx)sin(πy) = B*D*sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-π²)\n\nThis implies that B*D*e^(-π²) = 1. Since B and D are constants, we can choose B = D = e^(π²/2) to satisfy this condition. Therefore, the concentration at time t=1 is:\n\nc(x, y, 1) = e^(π²/2)*sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-π²) = sin(πx)sin(πy)"
