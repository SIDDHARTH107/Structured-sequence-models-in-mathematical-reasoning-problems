    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(2² + 3²) = √(4 + 9) = √13\n|B| = √(5² + 7²) = √(25 + 49) = √74\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B. To find A · B, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = (A₁ * B₁) + (A₂ * B₂)\n\nwhere A₁, A₂, B₁, and B₂ are the components of the vectors A and B.\n\nA · B = (2 * 5) + (3 * 7) = 10 + 21 = 31\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\ncos(θ) = 31 / (√13 * √74)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of A and B using the trigonometric formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\nA · B = (√13 * √74) * (31 / (√13 * √74))\nA · B = 31\n\nSo, the dot product of A and B is 31."
