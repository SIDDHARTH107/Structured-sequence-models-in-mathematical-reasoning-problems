    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given trigonometric function f(x) = 5 cos(2x - π/4), we need to identify the key features of the function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a trigonometric function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine or sine function. In this case, the coefficient of the cosine function is 5. Therefore, the amplitude is |5| = 5.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a trigonometric function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. For a cosine or sine function, the period is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nwhere B is the coefficient of the variable x inside the cosine or sine function. In this case, B = 2. Therefore, the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 5 cos(2x - π/4) is 5, and the period is π."
