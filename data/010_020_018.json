    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology of the torus knot T(3,4) using Morse-Novikov theory and the action filtration, we first need to understand the basics of these concepts.\n\n1. Torus knot T(3,4): A torus knot is a special kind of knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in R^3. T(3,4) denotes a torus knot with parameters p=3 and q=4, which means it wraps around the torus 3 times in one direction and 4 times in the other direction.\n\n2. Morse-Novikov theory: Morse-Novikov theory is an extension of Morse theory, which is a method used in differential topology to study the topology of manifolds using smooth functions. Morse-Novikov theory extends this to the study of closed 1-forms, which are not necessarily exact.\n\n3. Action filtration: In the context of Floer homology, the action filtration is a way to organize the critical points of the Morse function according to their action values. This helps to simplify the computation of Floer homology by considering only certain subsets of critical points.\n\nNow, let's compute the Floer homology of T(3,4):\n\nStep 1: Choose a suitable Morse function and Novikov 1-form on the knot complement. In this case, we can use the standard height function on the torus and the 1-form associated with the Seifert surface of the knot.\n\nStep 2: Compute the critical points of the Morse function and their action values. For T(3,4), there will be 12 critical points, corresponding to the intersections of the knot with the meridian and longitude circles of the torus.\n\nStep 3: Organize the critical points according to their action values using the action filtration. In this case, we can group the critical points into 4 levels, each containing 3 critical points.\n\nStep 4: Compute the Floer differential for each pair of critical points with consecutive action values. This involves counting the number of gradient flow lines between the critical points modulo 2.\n\nStep 5: Compute the Floer homology groups by taking the homology of the chain complex generated by the critical points and the Floer differential. In this case, the Floer homology of T(3,4) will have 4 non-trivial groups, corresponding to the 4 levels of the action filtration.\n\nIn conclusion, the Floer homology of the torus knot T(3,4) using Morse-Novikov theory and the action filtration consists of 4 non-trivial groups, each containing 3 generators."
