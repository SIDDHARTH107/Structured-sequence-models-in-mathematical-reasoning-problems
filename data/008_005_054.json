    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The given system of equations can be represented as the following augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 2  3  1 |  5 |\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 3  1  4 |  8 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a '1' in the top-left corner.\n\n```\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 2  3  1 |  5 |\n| 3  1  4 |  8 |\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2, and replace Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3.\n\n```\n|  1 -1  2 | -1 |\n|  0  5 -3 |  7 |\n|  0  4 -2 | 11 |\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 5.\n\n```\n|  1 -1  2 | -1 |\n|  0  1 -3/5 | 7/5 |\n|  0  4 -2 | 11 |\n```\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 1 with (Row 2 + Row 1), and replace Row 3 with (-4 * Row 2) + Row 3.\n\n```\n|  1  0  7/5 | 6/5 |\n|  0  1 -3/5 | 7/5 |\n|  0  0  2 |  3 |\n```\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by 2.\n\n```\n|  1  0  7/5 | 6/5 |\n|  0  1 -3/5 | 7/5 |\n|  0  0  1 |  3/2 |\n```\n\nStep 6: Replace Row 1 with (-7/5 * Row 3) + Row 1, and replace Row 2 with (3/5 * Row 3) + Row 2.\n\n```\n|  1  0  0 | -1/2 |\n|  0  1  0 |  1/2 |\n|  0  0  1 |  3/2 |\n```\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = -1/2\ny = 1/2\nz = 3/2"
