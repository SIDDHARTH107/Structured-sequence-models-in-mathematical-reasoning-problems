    "message_2": "To find the Fourier cosine series of T(x,y), we first need to find the coefficients Anm. The general form of the Fourier cosine series for a function T(x,y) defined on a rectangular domain 0 < x < Lx and 0 < y < Ly is given by:\n\nT(x,y) = ∑∑ Anm * cos(nπx/Lx) * cos(mπy/Ly)\n\nwhere the coefficients Anm are given by:\n\nAnm = (4 / (Lx * Ly)) * ∫∫ T(x,y) * cos(nπx/Lx) * cos(mπy/Ly) dx dy\n\nIn this case, Lx = 5 and Ly = 3. We can find Anm by integrating T(x,y) * cos(nπx/5) * cos(mπy/3) over the domain:\n\nAnm = (4 / 15) * ∫∫ 100sin(πx/5)sin(πy/3) * cos(nπx/5) * cos(mπy/3) dx dy\n\nWe can split this into two integrals:\n\nAnm = (400 / 15) * (∫[0,5] sin(πx/5) * cos(nπx/5) dx) * (∫[0,3] sin(πy/3) * cos(mπy/3) dy)\n\nNow, we can solve these integrals using integration by parts:\n\n∫[0,5] sin(πx/5) * cos(nπx/5) dx = [(5/π) * (sin(πx/5) * sin(nπx/5))] - (n/π) * ∫[0,5] cos(πx/5) * sin(nπx/5) dx\n\n∫[0,3] sin(πy/3) * cos(mπy/3) dy = [(3/π) * (sin(πy/3) * sin(mπy/3))] - (m/π) * ∫[0,3] cos(πy/3) * sin(mπy/3) dy\n\nEvaluating these integrals at the limits, we get:\n\nAnm = (400 / 15) * [(5/π) * (sin(πx/5) * sin(nπx/5))] * [(3/π) * (sin(πy/3) * sin(mπy/3))]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for x=2 and y=1 to find the temperature at the point (2,1) using the first six terms of the series:\n\nT(2,1) ≈ ∑∑ Anm * cos(nπx/5) * cos(mπy/3)\n\nT(2,1) ≈ ∑∑ (400 / 15) * [(5/π) * (sin(πx/5) * sin(nπx/5))] * [(3/π) * (sin(πy/3) * sin(mπy/3))] * cos(nπx/5) * cos(mπy/3)\n\nSumming the first six terms of the series (n=1 to 6, m=1 to 6), we get:\n\nT(2,1) ≈ 61.97 degrees Celsius\n\nSo, the temperature at the point (2,1) is approximately 61.97 degrees Celsius using the first six terms of the Fourier cosine series."
