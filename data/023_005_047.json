Its initial position and velocity are given by u(x,0)=0 and v(x,0)=sin(2πx), respectively. Find the position of the string u(x,t) at time t=1 second using the Fourier transform method to solve the wave equation.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the wave equation and the Fourier series method. The wave equation for a string fixed at both ends is given by:\n\n∂²u/∂t² = c² ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the displacement of the string, c is the wave speed, and x and t are the position and time variables, respectively. The wave speed c can be found using the formula:\n\nc = √(T/μ)\n\nwhere T is the tension in the string and μ is the linear mass density. Since the mass of the string is 2 kg and its length is 4 meters, the linear mass density is:\n\nμ = 2 kg / 4 m = 0.5 kg/m\n\nLet's assume the tension T is such that c = 1 m/s. Then, we have:\n\n∂²u/∂t² = ∂²u/∂x²\n\nThe initial conditions are given by:\n\nu(x,0) = 0\n∂u/∂t (x,0) = v(x,0) = sin(2πx)\n\nWe can represent the solution u(x,t) as a Fourier series:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [A_n * sin(nπx) * cos(nπct) + B_n * sin(nπx) * sin(nπct)]\n\nwhere A_n and B_n are the Fourier coefficients. Since u(x,0) = 0, we have:\n\n0 = Σ [A_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nThis implies that A_n = 0 for all n. Now, we need to find the coefficients B_n. We know that:\n\n∂u/∂t (x,0) = Σ [nπc * B_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nComparing this with the given initial velocity v(x,0) = sin(2πx), we can see that:\n\nnπc * B_n * sin(nπx) = sin(2πx)\n\nThis implies that B_n = 0 for all n except n = 2. For n = 2, we have:\n\n2πc * B_2 = 1\n\nSince c = 1 m/s, we get B_2 = 1/(2π). Therefore, the solution u(x,t) is given by:\n\nu(x,t) = B_2 * sin(2πx) * sin(2πt) = (1/(2π)) * sin(2πx) * sin(2πt)\n\nAt t = 1 second, the position of the string is:\n\nu(x,1) = (1/(2π)) * sin(2πx) * sin(2π) = 0\n\nSo, at t = 1 second, the string returns to its initial position, u(x,1) = 0."
