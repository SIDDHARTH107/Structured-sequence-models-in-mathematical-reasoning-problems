    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 7 vertices such that each vertex has degree 2. What is the maximum independent set in G?",
    "message_2": "Since each vertex in graph G has degree 2, the graph must consist of cycles. The maximum independent set in a cycle is half of the number of vertices in the cycle, rounded down if the cycle has an odd number of vertices.\n\nSince there are 7 vertices in G, there are two possible cycle configurations: a single cycle of 7 vertices or a cycle of 5 vertices and a cycle of 2 vertices.\n\nCase 1: A single cycle of 7 vertices\nIn this case, the maximum independent set is half of the number of vertices, rounded down, which is floor(7/2) = 3.\n\nCase 2: A cycle of 5 vertices and a cycle of 2 vertices\nFor the cycle of 5 vertices, the maximum independent set is floor(5/2) = 2. For the cycle of 2 vertices, the maximum independent set is floor(2/2) = 1. In this case, the maximum independent set in G is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nIn both cases, the maximum independent set in G is 3."
