    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute Alice's public key (A): A = (g^a) mod p\n2. Compute Bob's public key (B): B = (g^b) mod p\n3. Compute the shared secret key: K = (B^a) mod p = (A^b) mod p\n\nGiven the prime number p = 23, the primitive root g = 5, Alice's private key a = 6, and Bob's private key b = 15, we can calculate the shared secret key as follows:\n\n1. Calculate Alice's public key (A):\nA = (g^a) mod p\nA = (5^6) mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 8\n\n2. Calculate Bob's public key (B):\nB = (g^b) mod p\nB = (5^15) mod 23\nB = 30517578125 mod 23\nB = 19\n\n3. Calculate the shared secret key (K):\nK = (B^a) mod p = (A^b) mod p\nK = (19^6) mod 23 = (8^15) mod 23\nK = 47045881 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23\nK = 2\n\nSo, the shared secret key is 2."
