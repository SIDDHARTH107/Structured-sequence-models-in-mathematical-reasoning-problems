    "message_2": "The conjugate gradient method is typically used for solving large systems of linear equations, and it is not the most suitable method for finding the minimum value of a quadratic function like f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5. Instead, we can use basic calculus to find the minimum value of the function.\n\nTo find the minimum value of f(x), we first need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum or maximum. We can do this by taking the second derivative of the function and evaluating it at the critical point:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince f''(2) = 2 > 0, the critical point x = 2 is a minimum.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging the critical point back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)^2 - 4(2) + 5\nf(2) = 4 - 8 + 5\nf(2) = 1\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 is 1."
