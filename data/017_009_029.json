    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 9, and let a be an element in G with order 9. Since the order of a is 9, we have that a^9 = e (the identity element in G), and a^k ≠ e for any k < 9.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by a, denoted as H = <a>. The elements of H are {e, a, a^2, a^3, ..., a^8}. Since a has order 9, all these elements are distinct, and thus H has 9 elements. Since H is a subgroup of G and has the same number of elements as G, we have H = G.\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. Define a mapping φ: G → C9 as follows:\n\nφ(a^k) = k mod 9, for k = 0, 1, ..., 8.\n\nWe will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since a has order 9, a^k ≠ a^l for any k ≠ l (mod 9). Thus, φ(a^k) ≠ φ(a^l) for any k ≠ l (mod 9).\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let x, y ∈ G, where x = a^k and y = a^l for some k, l ∈ {0, 1, ..., 8}. Then,\n\nφ(xy) = φ(a^k * a^l) = φ(a^(k+l)) = (k + l) mod 9.\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nφ(x)φ(y) = (k mod 9)(l mod 9) = (k * l) mod 9.\n\nSince (k + l) mod 9 = (k * l) mod 9, we have φ(xy) = φ(x)φ(y).\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(a^k) = φ(a^l) for some k, l ∈ {0, 1, ..., 8}. Then, k mod 9 = l mod 9, which implies k = l (mod 9). Since 0 ≤ k, l ≤ 8, we must have k = l. Thus, φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: For any n ∈ {0, 1, ..., 8}, there exists an element a^n ∈ G such that φ(a^n) = n mod 9. Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. There is no non-abelian group of order 9, as all groups of order p^2, where p is a prime number, are abelian."
