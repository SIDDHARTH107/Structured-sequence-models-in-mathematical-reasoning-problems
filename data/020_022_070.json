    "message_1": "A toy factory has 100 hours to manufacture two types of toys, type A and type B. Each type A toy requires 3 hours of manufacturing time and yields a profit of $10. Each type B toy requires 4 hours of manufacturing time and yields a profit of $15. The factory wants to maximize its profit within the 100 hour limit. How many of each type of toy should they produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A toys and y be the number of type B toys.\n\nThe time constraint can be represented as:\n3x + 4y ≤ 100\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region. Then, we can check the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, let's find the points where the constraint equation is an equality:\n3x + 4y = 100\n\nTo find the x and y intercepts, we can set x and y to 0, respectively:\n\nWhen x = 0:\n4y = 100\ny = 25\n\nWhen y = 0:\n3x = 100\nx = 100/3 ≈ 33.33\n\nSo, the intercepts are (0, 25) and (33.33, 0). Now, we can plot the constraint line and find the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 25), and (33.33, 0). Since the factory can only produce whole numbers of toys, we need to find the integer coordinates within the feasible region that maximize the profit function.\n\nWe can check the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 25) = 10(0) + 15(25) = $375\nP(33, 0) = 10(33) + 15(0) = $330\n\nSince the factory can only produce whole numbers of toys, we can check the integer coordinates close to the vertices:\n\nP(1, 24) = 10(1) + 15(24) = $370\nP(32, 1) = 10(32) + 15(1) = $335\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 25), where the factory produces 0 type A toys and 25 type B toys. This results in a profit of $375."
