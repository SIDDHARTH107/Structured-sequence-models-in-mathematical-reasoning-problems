    "message_1": "A metallic sheet measuring 30cm by 40cm needs to be turned into a rectangular box with no top by cutting equal squares from each corner and folding up the sides. If the volume of the box needs to be 14400 cubic cm, what is the length of each side of the square that should be cut from each corner?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of each side of the square that should be cut from each corner.\n\nAfter cutting the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the rectangular box will be:\n- length: 40 - 2x\n- width: 30 - 2x\n- height: x\n\nThe volume of the box is given by the product of its length, width, and height:\nV = (40 - 2x)(30 - 2x)x\n\nWe are given that the volume of the box needs to be 14400 cubic cm:\n14400 = (40 - 2x)(30 - 2x)x\n\nTo solve for x, we can first expand the equation:\n14400 = 4x^3 - 140x^2 + 1200x\n\nNow we can solve the cubic equation for x. Since the problem states that equal squares are cut from each corner, we can assume that x is a positive integer. We can try different values of x and see which one satisfies the equation:\n\nFor x = 1:\n14400 = 4(1)^3 - 140(1)^2 + 1200(1)\n14400 ≠ 1064\n\nFor x = 2:\n14400 = 4(2)^3 - 140(2)^2 + 1200(2)\n14400 ≠ 1600\n\nFor x = 3:\n14400 = 4(3)^3 - 140(3)^2 + 1200(3)\n14400 = 14400\n\nSo, the length of each side of the square that should be cut from each corner is x = 3 cm."
