    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted an encrypted message that was encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. You suspect that this cipher was created by shifting each letter in the plaintext alphabet by a fixed number of positions. If the encrypted message is \"WKLV LV D QRWLFH\", what is the number of positions that the plaintext alphabet was shifted by?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of positions that the plaintext alphabet was shifted by, we can compare the encrypted message to the original message. We can start by assuming that the most common word in the English language, \"the,\" is present in the message. In the encrypted message, \"QRWLFH\" seems to be a likely candidate for \"the\" since it has the same number of letters.\n\nNow, let's compare the letters:\n\nQ -> T\nR -> H\nW -> E\n\nFrom Q to T, there is a shift of 3 positions forward in the alphabet (Q -> R -> S -> T). From R to H, there is a shift of 18 positions backward in the alphabet (R -> Q -> P -> ... -> I -> H). From W to E, there is a shift of 4 positions backward in the alphabet (W -> V -> U -> F -> E).\n\nSince all these shifts are consistent, we can conclude that the plaintext alphabet was shifted by 3 positions forward (or equivalently, 23 positions backward)."
