Find the general solution of the differential equation in terms of $x$ and use the initial conditions to determine the specific solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first note that it is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation associated with this differential equation is given by:\n\n$r^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n$r = \\pm i$\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 \\cos(x) + C_2 \\sin(x)$\n\nNow, we need to use the initial conditions to determine the specific solution. We are given that $y(0) = 2$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0) = 3$. \n\nUsing the first initial condition, we have:\n\n$2 = y(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0)$\n\nSince $\\cos(0) = 1$ and $\\sin(0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$2 = C_1$\n\nNow, we need to find the first derivative of $y(x)$:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -C_1 \\sin(x) + C_2 \\cos(x)$\n\nUsing the second initial condition, we have:\n\n$3 = \\frac{dy}{dx}(0) = -C_1 \\sin(0) + C_2 \\cos(0)$\n\nSince $\\sin(0) = 0$ and $\\cos(0) = 1$, we get:\n\n$3 = C_2$\n\nNow that we have found the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$, we can write the specific solution:\n\n$y(x) = 2 \\cos(x) + 3 \\sin(x)$"
