    "message_1": "A factory has reported that on average, 4 accidents occur in a week. What is the probability that no accidents will happen in the next 2 weeks?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Poisson probability formula to solve this problem. The Poisson formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (accidents in this case), k is the specific number of events we want to find the probability for (0 accidents in this case), λ is the average number of events (4 accidents per week), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nSince we want to find the probability of no accidents happening in the next 2 weeks, we need to first find the average number of accidents in 2 weeks. Since there are 4 accidents per week on average, there would be 4 * 2 = 8 accidents in 2 weeks on average. So, λ = 8.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Poisson formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-8) * 8^0) / 0!\n\nP(X = 0) = (0.00033546 * 1) / 1\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.00033546\n\nSo, the probability that no accidents will happen in the next 2 weeks is approximately 0.00033546 or 0.033546%."
