    "message_1": "Suppose a car manufacturing company wants to test the fuel efficiency of their new car model. They randomly select 25 cars of the same model and drive them under identical conditions. The mean fuel efficiency of these 25 cars is found to be 34 miles per gallon with a standard deviation of 2.5 miles per gallon. \n\nThe company wants to know with 95% confidence, what is the true mean fuel efficiency of the car model (assuming the sample is representative of the population). \n\nWhat is the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval for the true mean fuel efficiency of the car model?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean fuel efficiency of the car model, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence interval = sample mean ± (critical value * standard error)\n\nThe critical value for a 95% confidence interval with a normal distribution is 1.96. The standard error is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:\n\nStandard error = standard deviation / √sample size = 2.5 / √25 = 2.5 / 5 = 0.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower bound = 34 - (1.96 * 0.5) = 34 - 0.98 = 33.02 miles per gallon\nUpper bound = 34 + (1.96 * 0.5) = 34 + 0.98 = 34.98 miles per gallon\n\nSo, with 95% confidence, the true mean fuel efficiency of the car model is between 33.02 and 34.98 miles per gallon."
