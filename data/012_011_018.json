    "message_2": "In the given undirected graph:\n\n```\n    1---2---3\n        |   |\n        4---5\n```\n\nA cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nCut vertices in the graph: {2}\nExplanation: If we remove vertex 2 along with its incident edges, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 4} and {3, 5}.\n\nBridges in the graph: {(1, 2), (2, 3)}\nExplanation: If we remove edge (1, 2), the graph will be split into two connected components: {1} and {2, 3, 4, 5}. Similarly, if we remove edge (2, 3), the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 4} and {3, 5}."
