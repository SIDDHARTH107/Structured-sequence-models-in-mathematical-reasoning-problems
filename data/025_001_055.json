    "message_1": "Suppose you have two polynomial equations in two variables:\nf(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4 = 0\ng(x, y) = xy - 1 = 0\n\nFind the number of solutions that these two equations have together on the complex plane, using Bezout's theorem.",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves defined by polynomials f(x, y) and g(x, y) in the complex plane is equal to the product of their degrees, provided that the intersection points are counted with their multiplicities and the curves have no common components.\n\nIn this case, the degree of f(x, y) is 2 (since the highest power of x or y is 2) and the degree of g(x, y) is also 2 (since the highest power of x or y is 2). Therefore, according to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of these two curves in the complex plane is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSo, the two given polynomial equations have 4 solutions together on the complex plane."
