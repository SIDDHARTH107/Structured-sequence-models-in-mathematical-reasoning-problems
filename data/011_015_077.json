    "message_2": "To determine the smallest number of guests wearing the same color shirt such that either three guests are all wearing red shirts or three guests are all wearing blue shirts, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nSuppose there are 2 guests wearing red shirts and 2 guests wearing blue shirts. In this case, we don't have three guests wearing the same color shirt. Now, when the 5th guest arrives, they must wear either a red shirt or a blue shirt. If they wear a red shirt, we have 3 guests wearing red shirts. If they wear a blue shirt, we have 3 guests wearing blue shirts.\n\nSo, the smallest number of guests wearing the same color shirt such that either three guests are all wearing red shirts or three guests are all wearing blue shirts is 3."
