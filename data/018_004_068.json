    "message_1": "Given a universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and two sets A = {2, 4} and B = {1, 5}, find the complement of set A and the complement of set B. Show that the complement of a set is unique.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of a set, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in the given set.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all elements in U that are not in A. So, we have:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5}\n\nSimilarly, the complement of set B, denoted as B', contains all elements in U that are not in B. So, we have:\n\nB' = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's show that the complement of a set is unique. Suppose there are two different complements for set A, A1' and A2'. Since A1' and A2' are both complements of A, they must contain all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA1' = {1, 3, 5}\nA2' = {1, 3, 5}\n\nAs we can see, A1' and A2' are the same, which means that the complement of a set is unique. The same argument can be applied to set B and its complement B'."
