    "message_1": "A right triangle has one side that measures 6 cm and another side that measures 8 cm. What is the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 6 cm and b = 8 cm. The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc² = (6 cm)² + (8 cm)²\nc² = 36 cm² + 64 cm²\nc² = 100 cm²\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = √(100 cm²)\nc = 10 cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm."
