    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of Optimal Routing:\n\nA delivery driver needs to make deliveries to six different locations in a city. The distances between each location are as follows:\n\n1. Location A to Location B: 5 miles\n2. Location A to Location C: 8 miles\n3. Location A to Location D: 12 miles\n4. Location B to Location C: 3 miles\n5. Location B to Location D: 10 miles\n6. Location C to Location D: 6 miles\n7. Location D to Location E: 15 miles\n8. Location D to Location F: 20 miles\n9. Location E to Location F: 10 miles\n\nThe driver wants to determine the most optimal route to deliver all items and return to the starting point. What is the shortest distance the driver can travel to complete all deliveries and return to the starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance, we can use the brute force method to list all possible routes and calculate the total distance for each route. Since there are 6 locations, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, which is 120 routes. However, we can simplify the problem by considering that the driver must return to the starting point, so we can fix the starting point as Location A and calculate the routes for the remaining 5 locations. This will give us 4! (4 factorial) possible routes, which is 24 routes.\n\nHere are the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-F-A: 5+3+6+15+10+8 = 47 miles\n2. A-B-C-D-F-E-A: 5+3+6+20+10+12 = 56 miles\n3. A-B-C-E-F-D-A: 5+3+9+10+20+12 = 59 miles\n4. A-B-D-C-E-F-A: 5+10+6+9+10+8 = 48 miles\n5. A-B-D-C-F-E-A: 5+10+6+21+10+12 = 64 miles\n6.

A-C-D-B-F-E-A: 8+6+10+20+10+12 = 66 miles\n11. A-C-D-E-F-B-A: 8+6+15+10+20+5 = 64 miles\n12. A-D-B-C-E-F-A: 12+10+3+9+10+5 = 49 miles\n13. A-D-B-C-F-E-A: 12+10+3+21+10+12 = 68 miles\n14. A-D-C-B-E-F-A: 12+6+3+9+10+5 = 45 miles\n15. A-D-C-B-F-E-A: 12+6+3+21+10+12 = 64 miles\n16. A-D-E-F-B-C-A: 12+15+10+20+5+3 = 65 miles\n17. A-D-E-F-C-B-A: 12+15+10+21+3+5 = 66 miles\n18.

A-D-F-B-C-E-A: 12+20+10+3+9+15 = 69 miles\n\nThe shortest distance is 45 miles, and the optimal route is A-D-C-B-E-F-A."
