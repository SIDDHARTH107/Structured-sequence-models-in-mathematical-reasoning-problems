The other end of the rod remains insulated.\n\nIf the length of the rod is $L=0.5$ meters and the thermal diffusivity constant of the metal is $k=0.5$ $cm^2/s$, find the temperature distribution $u(x, t)$ within the rod over time.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on $x$ and the other on $t$:\n\n$$u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the diffusion equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x) \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = k T(t) \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2}$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $kXT$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{kT} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{kT} \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda^2 = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k\\lambda^2 T$\n2. $\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda^2 X$\n\nThe first equation can be solved directly:\n\n$$T(t) = A e^{-k\\lambda^2 t}$$\n\nwhere $A$ is a constant.\n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions:\n\n$$X(0) = 0$$ (since the temperature at $x=0$ is fixed at $500$ degrees Celsius)\n\n$$X'(L) = 0$$ (since the other end of the rod is insulated)\n\nThe general solution of the second equation is:\n\n$$X(x) = B\\cos(\\lambda x) + C\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$$X(0) = B\\cos(0) + C\\sin(0) = B = 0$$\n\n$$X'(L) = -C\\lambda\\sin(\\lambda L) = 0$$\n\nSince $C$ cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we must have:\n\n$$\\sin(\\lambda L) = 0$$\n\nThis implies that $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n\nNow, the solution for each eigenvalue is:\n\n$$u_n(x, t) = A_n e^{-k\\lambda_n^2 t} \\sin(\\lambda_n x)$$\n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of these solutions:\n\n$$u(x, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n e^{-k\\lambda_n^2 t} \\sin(\\lambda_n x)$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition:\n\n$$u(x, 0) = 100 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(\\lambda_n x)$$\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and we can find the coefficients using the orthogonality property:\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_0^L (100) \\sin(\\lambda_n x) dx$$\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{2}{0.5} \\int_0^{0.5} (100) \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{0.5}) dx$$\n\n$$A_n = 4 \\int_0^{0.5} (100) \\sin(n\\pi x) dx$$\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{400}{n\\pi} (1 - (-1)^n)$$\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution within the rod over time is:\n\n$$u(x, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{400}{n\\pi} (1 - (-1)^n) e^{-k\\lambda_n^2 t} \\sin(\\lambda_n x)$$\n\nwhere $k = 0.5$ $cm^2/s$ and $L = 0.5$ meters."
