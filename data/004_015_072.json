    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 3x^3 - 12x^2 + 9x + 2, we need to find the second derivative and then solve for x when the second derivative is equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^3 - 12x^2 + 9x + 2)\nf'(x) = 9x^2 - 24x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (9x^2 - 24x + 9)\nf''(x) = 18x - 24\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to solve f''(x) = 0:\n\n18x - 24 = 0\n18x = 24\nx = 24/18\nx = 4/3\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 4/3. To find the corresponding y-value, plug this x-value back into the original function:\n\nf(4/3) = 3(4/3)^3 - 12(4/3)^2 + 9(4/3) + 2\nf(4/3) = 3(64/27) - 12(16/9) + 12 + 2\nf(4/3) = 64/9 - 64/3 + 12 + 2\nf(4/3) = 64/9 - 192/9 + 108/9 + 18/9\nf(4/3) = -10/9\n\nSo, the inflection point is at (4/3, -10/9)."
