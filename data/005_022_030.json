    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs claims that the average lifespan of their product is 1200 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. However, a sample of 50 light bulbs was taken and the average lifespan was found to be 1175 hours. Is there evidence to suggest that the actual average lifespan of the bulbs is less than what the manufacturer claims at a significance level of 5%?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is evidence to suggest that the actual average lifespan of the bulbs is less than what the manufacturer claims at a significance level of 5%, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 1200 hours\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ < 1200 hours\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic.\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\nt = (1175 - 1200) / (100 / sqrt(50))\nt = (-25) / (100 / sqrt(50))\nt = -25 / (100 / 7.071)\nt = -25 / 14.142\nt ≈ -1.77\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value.\nSince we are using a one-tailed test with a significance level of 5%, we will look up the critical value in a t-distribution table with 49 degrees of freedom (50 - 1). The critical value is approximately -1.68.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value.\nOur test statistic, -1.77, is less than the critical value, -1.68.\n\nStep 5: Make a decision.\nSince our test statistic is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence to suggest that the actual average lifespan of the bulbs is less than what the manufacturer claims at a significance level of 5%."
