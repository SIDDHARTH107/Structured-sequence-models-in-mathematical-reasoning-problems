    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix, which consists of the partial derivatives of the given functions with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 5 and g(x, y) = x^3 - y - 1. Then the Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y |\n    | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂g/∂x = 3x^2\n∂g/∂y = -1\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ = | 2x   2y  |\n    | 3x^2 -1  |\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method iteratively using the following formula for updating the (x, y) values:\n\n(x, y) = (x, y) - J^(-1) * F(x, y)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the column vector of the functions f(x, y) and g(x, y), and J^(-1) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix.\n\nWe start with the initial guess (x0, y0) = (1, 2). We will iterate until the difference between consecutive (x, y) values is less than 10^(-6).\n\n1st iteration:\nx1 = 1 - (2*2 - 2*2)^(-1) * (1^2 + 2^2 - 5) = 1 - 0 = 1\ny1 = 2 - (2*2 - 2*2)^(-1) * (1^3 - 2 - 1) = 2 - 0 = 2\n\nSince there is no change in the values of x and y after the first iteration, the initial guess (x0, y0) = (1, 2) is already the solution accurate to 6 decimal places. Therefore, the solution is (x, y) = (1, 2)."
