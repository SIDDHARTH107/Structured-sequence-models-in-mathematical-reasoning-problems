A random sample of 25 bottles is selected for quality control. Find the probability that the average weight of the bottles in the sample is less than 495g.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the average weight of the bottles in the sample is less than 495g, we can use the z-score formula for a sample mean. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\nx̄ = 495g (the sample mean we want to find the probability for)\nμ = 500g (the population mean)\nσ = 10g (the population standard deviation)\nn = 25 (the sample size)\n\nPlugging these values into the z-score formula, we get:\n\nz = (495 - 500) / (10 / √25)\nz = (-5) / (10 / 5)\nz = (-5) / 2\nz = -2.5\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability using a standard normal distribution table or calculator. The probability of a z-score being less than -2.5 is approximately 0.0062 or 0.62%.\n\nSo, there is a 0.62% probability that the average weight of the bottles in the sample is less than 495g."
