A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number.\n\nLet's start by listing the first few Sophie Germain primes and their corresponding 2p + 1 primes:\n\n1. p = 2, 2p + 1 = 5 (both prime)\n2. p = 3, 2p + 1 = 7 (both prime)\n3. p = 5, 2p + 1 = 11 (both prime)\n4. p = 11, 2p + 1 = 23 (both prime)\n5. p = 23, 2p + 1 = 47 (both prime)\n\nNow, let's check which of these are twin primes:\n\n1. p = 2, twin prime pairs: (2, 3) or (1, 2) - not a twin prime\n2. p = 3, twin prime pairs: (1, 3) or (3, 5) - not a twin prime\n3. p = 5, twin prime pairs: (3, 5) or (5, 7) - both twin prime pairs\n4. p = 11, twin prime pairs: (9, 11) or (11, 13) - not a twin prime\n5. p = 23, twin prime pairs: (21, 23) or (23, 25) - not a twin prime\n\nThe smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a twin prime is 5."
