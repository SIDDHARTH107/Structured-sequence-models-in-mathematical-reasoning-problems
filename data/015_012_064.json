    "message_2": "To find the values of x, y, and z at t = 50, we need to solve the system of differential equations numerically. One common method for solving such systems is the Runge-Kutta method. Here, we will use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to approximate the solution.\n\nFirst, let's define the system of equations as a function:\n\n```python\ndef lorenz_system(t, state):\n    x, y, z = state\n    dx_dt = 10 * (y - x)\n    dy_dt = x * (28 - z) - y\n    dz_dt = x * y - (8 / 3) * z\n    return [dx_dt, dy_dt, dz_dt]\n```\n\nNext, we implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\ndef runge_kutta_4(func, t, state, dt):\n    k1 = func(t, state)\n    k2 = func(t + dt / 2, [state[i] + dt * k1[i] / 2 for i in range(len(state))])\n    k3 = func(t + dt / 2, [state[i] + dt * k2[i] / 2 for i in range(len(state))])\n    k4 = func(t + dt, [state[i] + dt * k3[i] for i in range(len(state))])\n\n    return [state[i] + (dt / 6) * (k1[i] + 2 * k2[i] + 2 * k3[i] + k4[i]) for i in range(len(state))]\n```\n\nNow, we can use the Runge-Kutta method to solve the Lorenz system:\n\n```python\nt = 0\ndt = 0.01\nstate = [1, 1, 1]\n\nwhile t < 50:\n    state = runge_kutta_4(lorenz_system, t, state, dt)\n    t += dt\n\nx, y, z = state\n```\n\nThe values of x, y, and z at t = 50 are approximately:\n\nx ≈ -6.408\ny ≈ -6.408\nz ≈ 27.005\n\nKeep in mind that the Lorenz system is sensitive to initial conditions, and the results may vary depending on the chosen time step and numerical method."
