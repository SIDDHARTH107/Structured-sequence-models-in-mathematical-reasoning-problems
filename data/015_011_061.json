    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific problem for the math student to solve related to the chaotic behavior of the double pendulum:\n\nConsider a double pendulum with masses m1 = 2 kg and m2 = 1 kg, and lengths l1 = 1 m and l2 = 0.5 m. Assume that the double pendulum is initially released from rest at a small angle of θ1 = 5 degrees and θ2 = 1 degree. Use numerical methods to calculate the positions of the masses over time, and plot the resulting trajectories in a phase space diagram for a time interval of 50 seconds.\n\nWhat is the approximate maximum angle between the two masses during this time interval, and at what time does it occur? How does the system's behavior change if the initial angles are slightly modified?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the equations of motion for the double pendulum and then apply a numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to calculate the positions of the masses over time.\n\nThe equations of motion for the double pendulum are given by:\n\nθ1'' = (-(g * (2 * m1 + m2) * sin(θ1) - m2 * g * sin(θ1 - 2 * θ2) - 2 * sin(θ1 - θ2) * m2 * (θ2'^2 * l2 + θ1'^2 * l1 * cos(θ1 - θ2))) / (l1 * (2 * m1 + m2 - m2 * cos(2 * θ1 - 2 * θ2))))\n\nθ2'' = (2 * sin(θ1 - θ2) * (θ1'^2 * l1 * (m1 + m2) + g * (m1 + m2) * cos(θ1) + θ2'^2 * l2 * m2 * cos(θ1 - θ2))) / (l2 * (2 * m1 + m2 - m2 * cos(2 * θ1 - 2 * θ2))))\n\nHere, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and θ1'' and θ2'' are the angular accelerations of the two pendulum masses.\n\nWe can convert the initial angles from degrees to radians:\n\nθ1 = 5 * (π / 180) ≈ 0.0873 radians\nθ2 = 1 * (π / 180) ≈ 0.0175 radians\n\nNow, we can use the Runge-Kutta method to numerically solve the equations of motion for the given time interval of 50 seconds. After calculating the positions of the masses over time, we can plot the resulting trajectories in a phase space diagram.\n\nTo find the approximate maximum angle between the two masses during this time interval, we can calculate the difference between θ1 and θ2 at each time step and find the maximum value.\n\nAs for how the system's behavior changes if the initial angles are slightly modified, the double pendulum is known for its chaotic behavior. This means that even small changes in the initial conditions can lead to drastically different trajectories over time. The system becomes highly sensitive to the initial angles, and predicting the long-term behavior of the double pendulum becomes increasingly difficult."
