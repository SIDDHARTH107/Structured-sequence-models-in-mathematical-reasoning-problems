    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to chemical reaction kinetics and rate equations for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose a chemical reaction is occurring in which the rate at which a reactant is being consumed can be modeled by the equation \n\n$$R = k[A]^2$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the rate of reaction, $[A]$ is the concentration of the reactant, and $k$ is the rate constant. If the initial concentration of the reactant is $[A]_0 = 0.2\\ \\text{mol/L}$ and the rate constant is $k=0.05\\ \\text{L/mol}\\cdot\\text{s}$, determine the concentration of the reactant after 60 seconds of reaction.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to integrate the rate equation to find the concentration of the reactant as a function of time. First, we rewrite the rate equation as:\n\n$$-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]^2$$\n\nNow, we separate the variables and integrate:\n\n$$\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A]} \\frac{d[A]}{[A]^2} = \\int_0^t -k\\ dt$$\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{[A]} \\Big|_{[A]_0}^{[A]} = -kt \\Big|_0^t$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the integrals:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{[A]} + \\frac{1}{[A]_0} = -kt$$\n\nWe are given the initial concentration $[A]_0 = 0.2\\ \\text{mol/L}$ and the rate constant $k = 0.05\\ \\text{L/mol}\\cdot\\text{s}$. We want to find the concentration $[A]$ after 60 seconds. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{[A]} + \\frac{1}{0.2} = -0.05 \\cdot 60$$\n\nSolving for $[A]$, we get:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{[A]} = -5 - \\frac{1}{0.2}$$\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{[A]} = -10$$\n\n$$[A] = 0.1\\ \\text{mol/L}$$\n\nSo, the concentration of the reactant after 60 seconds of reaction is $0.1\\ \\text{mol/L}$."
