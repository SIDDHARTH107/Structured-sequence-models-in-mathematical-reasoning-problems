    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + x^2$, we first look for singular points on the curve. A singular point is a point where both partial derivatives with respect to x and y are zero.\n\nLet $f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x^2$. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we look for points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$-3x^2 - 2x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$-3x^2 - 2x = 0$\n\n$x(-3x - 2) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: $x = 0$ and $x = -\\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, we have two singular points: $(0, 0)$ and $(-\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$.\n\nNow, we perform a change of coordinates to remove the singular points. We can use the transformation $x = u - \\frac{1}{3}$ and $y = v$. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$v^2 = (u - \\frac{1}{3})^3 + (u - \\frac{1}{3})^2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$v^2 = u^3 - \\frac{1}{3}u^2$\n\nNow, we check for singular points again:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - \\frac{2}{3}u$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} = 2v$\n\nSetting the partial derivatives to zero, we get:\n\n$3u^2 - \\frac{2}{3}u = 0$\n\n$2v = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $v = 0$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$3u^2 - \\frac{2}{3}u = 0$\n\n$u(3u - 2) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for u: $u = 0$ and $u = \\frac{2}{3}$. However, since we have already removed the singular point at $u = 0$, we only need to consider the point $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$. This point is not a singular point on the transformed curve, so we have found the minimal model:\n\n$v^2 = u^3 - \\frac{1}{3}u^2$"
