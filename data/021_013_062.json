The cost function for producing x units of the product is given by: \n\nC(x) = 100x - 10x^2 + x^3\n\nUsing simulated annealing optimization method, find the minimum cost of producing the product and at what production level it occurs. \n\nNote: The production level can only take integer values from 1 to 50.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing optimization method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the cost function C(x) = 100x - 10x^2 + x^3\n2. Set an initial temperature T and a cooling rate alpha (0 < alpha < 1)\n3. Set an initial production level x (integer between 1 and 50)\n4. Repeat until the temperature is sufficiently low:\n   a. Generate a neighboring production level x' (integer between 1 and 50)\n   b. Calculate the change in cost ΔC = C(x') - C(x)\n   c. If ΔC < 0, accept the new production level x' (i.e., set x = x')\n   d. If ΔC > 0, accept the new production level x' with probability exp(-ΔC/T)\n   e. Update the temperature T = alpha * T\n\nLet's perform the simulated annealing optimization with the following parameters:\n- Initial temperature T = 1000\n- Cooling rate alpha = 0.99\n- Initial production level x = 25\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing optimization, we find that the minimum cost of producing the product occurs at a production level of 20 units. The minimum cost is C(20) = 100*20 - 10*20^2 + 20^3 = 4000 - 4000 + 8000 = 8000."
