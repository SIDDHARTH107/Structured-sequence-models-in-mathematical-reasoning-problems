    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z) that lie on the circle |z| = 2, we first need to find the zeros of the function f(z) = z^3 - 3z. Let's set f(z) to 0 and solve for z:\n\nz^3 - 3z = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out z:\n\nz(z^2 - 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us three possible zeros: z = 0, z = √3, and z = -√3.\n\nNow, we need to check which of these zeros lie on the circle |z| = 2. Recall that the circle |z| = 2 is defined as the set of all complex numbers z such that the distance from z to the origin is 2. In other words, |z| = 2.\n\nLet's check each zero:\n\n1. z = 0:\n|0| = 0, which is not equal to 2. So, z = 0 does not lie on the circle |z| = 2.\n\n2. z = √3:\n|√3| = √3, which is not equal to 2. So, z = √3 does not lie on the circle |z| = 2.\n\n3. z = -√3:\n|-√3| = √3, which is not equal to 2. So, z = -√3 does not lie on the circle |z| = 2.\n\nNone of the zeros of f(z) = z^3 - 3z lie on the circle |z| = 2."
