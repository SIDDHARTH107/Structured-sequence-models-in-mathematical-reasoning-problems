    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition method, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 5\n2x - 4y + 6z = -2\nx + 0.5y - z = 0.5\n\nThe coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix B are:\n\nA = | 3   2  -1 |\n    | 2  -4   6 |\n    | 1  0.5 -1 |\n\nB = |  5  |\n    | -2  |\n    | 0.5 |\n\nNow, we perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\nL = | 1   0   0  |\n    | l21 1   0  |\n    | l31 l32 1  |\n\nU = | u11 u12 u13 |\n    | 0   u22 u23 |\n    | 0   0   u33 |\n\nUsing the Doolittle algorithm, we can find the elements of L and U:\n\nu11 = 3\nu12 = 2\nu13 = -1\n\nl21 = 2/3\nu22 = -4 - (2/3 * 2) = -8/3\nu23 = 6 - (2/3 * -1) = 20/3\n\nl31 = 1/3\nl32 = (0.5 - (1/3 * 2))/(-8/3) = 1/2\nu33 = -1 - (1/3 * -1) - (1/2 * 20/3) = -3/2\n\nSo, L and U are:\n\nL = |  1    0    0  |\n    | 2/3   1    0  |\n    | 1/3  1/2   1  |\n\nU = |  3   2   -1  |\n    |  0  -8/3 20/3 |\n    |  0   0  -3/2 |\n\nNow, we solve the system LY = B for Y:\n\nY = |  y1  |\n    |  y2  |\n    |  y3  |\n\n1 * y1 = 5\ny1 = 5\n\n2/3 * y1 + y2 = -2\ny2 = -2 - (2/3 * 5) = -8/3\n\n1/3 * y1 + 1/2 * y2 + y3 = 0.5\ny3 = 0.5 - (1/3 * 5) - (1/2 * -8/3) = 1/2\n\nY = |  5  |\n    | -8/3|\n    | 1/2 |\n\nFinally, we solve the system UX = Y for X:\n\nX = |  x  |\n    |  y  |\n    |  z  |\n\n3x + 2y - z = 5\n2x - 4y + 6z = -2\nx + 0.5y - z = 0.5\n\n3x + 2y - z = 5\nx = (5 - 2y + z) / 3\n\n-8/3 * y + 20/3 * z = -8/3\nz = (1/2 - y) / 2\n\nSubstituting z back into x:\n\nx = (5 - 2y + (1/2 - y) / 2) / 3\nx = 1 - y/2\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nx = 1 - (-8/3)/2 = 1 + 4/3 = 7/3\ny = -8/3\nz = (1/2 - (-8/3)) / 2 = (1/2 + 8/3) / 2 = 17/6 / 2 = 17/12\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 7/3\ny = -8/3\nz = 17/12"
