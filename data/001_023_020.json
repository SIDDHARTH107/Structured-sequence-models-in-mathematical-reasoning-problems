    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) + sin(x) = 0, we can use the double angle identity for sine, which is sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So, the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) + sin(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out sin(x):\n\nsin(x)(2cos(x) + 1) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either sin(x) = 0 or 2cos(x) + 1 = 0.\n\nCase 1: sin(x) = 0\nThe sine function is zero at x = 0 and x = π in the interval [0, 2π]. So, we have two solutions for this case: x = 0 and x = π.\n\nCase 2: 2cos(x) + 1 = 0\nThis equation can be rewritten as cos(x) = -1/2. The cosine function is equal to -1/2 at x = 2π/3 and x = 4π/3 in the interval [0, 2π]. So, we have two more solutions for this case: x = 2π/3 and x = 4π/3.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for the equation sin(2x) + sin(x) = 0 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 0, x = π, x = 2π/3, and x = 4π/3."
