    "message_1": "A signal x(t) has a Fourier Transform X(jω) given by X(jω) = 2π [δ(ω − 2) + δ(ω + 2) + δ(ω)].\n\nWhat is the frequency content of the signal x(t)?",
    "message_2": "The frequency content of the signal x(t) can be determined by analyzing the given Fourier Transform X(jω). The Fourier Transform consists of three Dirac delta functions:\n\n1. δ(ω - 2): This represents a frequency component at ω = 2 rad/s.\n2. δ(ω + 2): This represents a frequency component at ω = -2 rad/s.\n3. δ(ω): This represents a frequency component at ω = 0 rad/s (DC component).\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal x(t) consists of three frequency components: 0 rad/s (DC component), 2 rad/s, and -2 rad/s."
