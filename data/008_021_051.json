    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + y = 3\n\n4x + 2y = 6\n\nIf we write this system in matrix form, we get:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nUse matrix algebra to solve the system by finding the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Check whether the matrix is singular or not.",
    "message_2": "To find the inverse of the coefficient matrix, we first need to check if the matrix is invertible. A matrix is invertible if its determinant is non-zero. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is calculated as follows:\n\ndet(A) = ad - bc\n\nwhere A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}\n\nIn our case, the matrix A is:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\ndet(A) = (2)(2) - (1)(4) = 4 - 4 = 0\n\nSince the determinant is 0, the matrix A is singular, which means it is not invertible. Therefore, we cannot find the inverse of the coefficient matrix to solve the system of linear equations using matrix algebra."
