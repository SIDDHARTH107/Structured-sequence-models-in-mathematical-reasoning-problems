    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(4x) with respect to x, we can use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is 3sin(u) and the inner function is u = 4x.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\nd(3sin(u))/du = 3cos(u)\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\nd(4x)/dx = 4\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\ndy/dx = (d(3sin(u))/du) * (d(4x)/dx)\ndy/dx = 3cos(u) * 4\n\nSince u = 4x, we can substitute it back in:\ndy/dx = 3cos(4x) * 4\ndy/dx = 12cos(4x)\n\nNow, we want to find the derivative at x = pi/6:\ndy/dx = 12cos(4(pi/6))\ndy/dx = 12cos(2pi/3)\n\ncos(2pi/3) = -1/2 (since it's in the second quadrant where cosine is negative)\n\nSo, the derivative at x = pi/6 is:\ndy/dx = 12(-1/2)\ndy/dx = -6"
