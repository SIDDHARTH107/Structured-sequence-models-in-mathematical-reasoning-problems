    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x) = (3x^2 + 2x)^5. We will use the power rule and the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [(3x^2 + 2x)^5]\nf'(x) = 5(3x^2 + 2x)^4 * d/dx (3x^2 + 2x)\nf'(x) = 5(3x^2 + 2x)^4 * (6x + 2)\nf'(x) = (5(3x^2 + 2x)^4) * (6x + 2)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of g(x) = sqrt(x):\n\ng'(x) = d/dx [x^(1/2)]\ng'(x) = (1/2)x^(-1/2)\n\nNow we can find the derivative of f(g(x)) using the chain rule:\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\nh'(x) = (5(3g(x)^2 + 2g(x))^4) * (6g(x) + 2) * (1/2)g(x)^(-1/2)\n\nNow substitute g(x) = sqrt(x) back into the equation:\n\nh'(x) = (5(3(sqrt(x))^2 + 2(sqrt(x)))^4) * (6(sqrt(x)) + 2) * (1/2)x^(-1/2)\nh'(x) = (5(3x + 2sqrt(x))^4) * (6sqrt(x) + 2) * (1/2)x^(-1/2)\n\nThis is the derivative of f(g(x)) using the chain rule."
