    "message_1": "A circle with a radius of 7 cm has a central angle of 60 degrees. What is the perimeter of the sector formed by this central angle?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc (s) is:\n\ns = (central angle / 360) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 7 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (60 / 360) × 2π(7)\ns = (1/6) × 14π\ns = 14π/6\ns = 7π/3 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the length of the arc to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2 radii\nPerimeter = (7π/3) + 2(7)\nPerimeter = (7π/3) + 14\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (7π/3) + 14 cm."
