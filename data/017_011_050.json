Cyclic group C12:\nA cyclic group of order 12 is generated by a single element, say g, and has elements {1, g, g^2, ..., g^11}. The group G is isomorphic to C12 if and only if G has an element of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 4. If G has an element of order 12, then the product of the orders of these subgroups must be 12. If this is the case, then G is isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. Alternating group A4:\nThe alternating group A4 is the group of even permutations of 4 elements. It has order 12 and is generated by 3-cycles. To determine if G is isomorphic to A4, we need to check if G has the same structure as A4. Specifically, we need to find out if G has at least 3 subgroups of order 2 and at least 4 subgroups of order 3. If this is the case, then G is isomorphic to A4.\n\n3. Dihedral group D6:\nThe dihedral group D6 is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon, including rotations and reflections. It has order 12 and is generated by a rotation r of order 6 and a reflection s of order 2, with the relation srs = r^(-1). To determine if G is isomorphic to D6, we need to check if G has the same structure as D6. Specifically, we need to find out if G has a subgroup of order 6 and an element of order 2 that satisfies the relation srs = r^(-1). If this is the case, then G is isomorphic to D6.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6, we need to analyze the structure of G and compare it to the structures of these groups. If G has an element of order 12, then it is isomorphic to C12. If G has at least 3 subgroups of order 2 and at least 4 subgroups of order 3, then it is isomorphic to A4. If G has a subgroup of order 6 and an element of order 2 that satisfies the relation srs = r^(-1), then it is isomorphic to D6."
