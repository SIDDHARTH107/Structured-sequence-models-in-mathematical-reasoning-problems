    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin²(x) - 3sin(x) - 2 = 0, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in sin(x). Let y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y² - 3y - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(2y + 1)(y - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for y:\n\n1) 2y + 1 = 0 => y = -1/2\n2) y - 2 = 0 => y = 2\n\nHowever, since the sine function has a range of [-1, 1], the second solution (y = 2) is not valid. So, we only need to consider the first solution:\n\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy this equation. The arcsin function gives us the principal value:\n\nx = arcsin(-1/2) = -π/6\n\nHowever, since x must be in the interval [0, 2π], we need to find the other angle that has the same sine value. We know that sin(π - x) = sin(x), so:\n\nx = π - (-π/6) = 7π/6\n\nSo, the two solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = 7π/6 and x = 11π/6"
