    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. In other words, if we pick all the vertices in the vertex cover, we can \"cover\" all the edges in the graph.\n\nGiven that the graph G has 7 vertices and the vertex cover VC has 3 vertices, let's try to minimize the number of edges in G.\n\nSince we have 3 vertices in the vertex cover, we can have at most 4 vertices that are not in the vertex cover. To minimize the number of edges, we should connect each of these 4 vertices to one of the vertices in the vertex cover. This way, we can ensure that each edge is incident to at least one vertex in the vertex cover.\n\nIn this configuration, we have 4 edges connecting the 4 vertices not in the vertex cover to the vertices in the vertex cover. We can't have any edges between the 4 vertices not in the vertex cover, as that would require adding another vertex to the vertex cover, which contradicts the given |VC| = 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges in G is 4."
