    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the definition of a connected topological space. A topological space X is said to be connected if there does not exist a non-empty proper subset A of X such that A is both open and closed in X.\n\nWe are given that X is connected and A is both open and closed in X. We want to show that either A = ∅ or A = X.\n\nSuppose A ≠ ∅ and A ≠ X. Then A is a non-empty proper subset of X. Since A is both open and closed in X, this contradicts the definition of X being connected. Therefore, our assumption that A ≠ ∅ and A ≠ X must be false.\n\nThus, we conclude that either A = ∅ or A = X."
