    "message_2": "To find the trigonometric ratios, we first need to find the length of side BC, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC:\n\nAB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2\n3^2 + 4^2 = BC^2\n9 + 16 = BC^2\n25 = BC^2\nBC = 5\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the trigonometric ratios:\n\na) sin A = opposite side / hypotenuse = AB / BC = 3 / 5\n\nb) cos A = adjacent side / hypotenuse = AC / BC = 4 / 5\n\nc) tan A = opposite side / adjacent side = AB / AC = 3 / 4\n\nSo, the trigonometric ratios for angle A are:\n\nsin A = 3/5\ncos A = 4/5\ntan A = 3/4"
