    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 + 5iz + 2 with respect to z, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe derivative of z^3 with respect to z is 3z^2.\nThe derivative of 2z^2 with respect to z is 4z.\nThe derivative of 5iz with respect to z is 5i.\nThe derivative of the constant term 2 is 0.\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) with respect to z is:\n\nf'(z) = 3z^2 + 4z + 5i\n\nNow, let's determine where the function is analytic. A function is analytic at a point if it is differentiable in some neighborhood of that point. Since f(z) is a polynomial function with complex coefficients, it is differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, the function f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 + 5iz + 2 is analytic everywhere in the complex plane."
