    "message_2": "The number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120 can be found using the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of possible non-isomorphic groups using the formula: k(G) = k(2^3) * k(3) * k(5) = 5 * 1 * 1 = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\nNow, let's list out all the non-abelian groups of order 120:\n\n1. S_5: The symmetric group on 5 elements. It is non-abelian because the symmetric group is non-abelian for n ≥ 3.\n2. A_5: The alternating group on 5 elements. It is non-abelian because the alternating group is non-abelian for n ≥ 4.\n3. D_60: The dihedral group of order 120 (2 * 60). It is non-abelian because the dihedral group is non-abelian for n ≥ 3.\n4. SL(2,5): The special linear group of 2x2 matrices with determinant 1 over the finite field with 5 elements. It is non-abelian because the special linear group is non-abelian for n ≥ 2 and q ≥ 3.\n5. The semidirect product of Z_5 and (Z_2)^3, where Z_n denotes the cyclic group of order n. This group is non-abelian because the semidirect product of two non-trivial groups is non-abelian if the action is non-trivial.\n\nThese are the 5 non-abelian groups of order 120."
