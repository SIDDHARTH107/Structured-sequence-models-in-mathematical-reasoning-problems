    "message_1": "A delivery company wants to determine the optimal route to visit 5 different locations A, B, C, D, and E. The company has data on the distances between each of the locations and wants to minimize the total distance traveled while visiting each location exactly once. The distances between each location are as follows:\n\nDistance between A and B = 8km  \nDistance between A and C = 5km  \nDistance between A and D = 11km  \nDistance between A and E = 6km  \nDistance between B and C = 7km  \nDistance between B and D = 6km  \nDistance between B and E = 10km  \nDistance between C and D = 12km  \nDistance between C and E = 8km  \nDistance between D and E = 9km\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the delivery company to visit all 5 locations? What is the total distance traveled on this route?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for each possible route and then selecting the route with the minimum distance. There are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible routes, but since the route is a loop, we can divide this number by 5, which gives us 24 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E: 8 + 7 + 12 + 9 = 36\n2. A-B-C-E-D: 8 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 32\n3. A-B-D-C-E: 8 + 6 + 12 + 8 = 34\n4. A-B-D-E-C: 8 + 6 + 9 + 8 = 31\n5. A-B-E-C-D: 8 + 10 + 8 + 12 = 38\n6. A-B-E-D-C: 8 + 10 + 9 + 12 = 39\n\n7. A-C-B-D-E: 5 + 7 + 6 + 9 = 27\n8. A-C-B-E-D: 5 + 7 + 10 + 9 = 31\n9. A-C-D-B-E: 5 + 12 + 6 + 9 = 32\n10. A-C-D-E-B: 5 + 12 + 9 + 10 = 36\n11. A-C-E-B-D: 5 + 8 + 10 + 6 = 29\n12. A-C-E-D-B: 5 + 8 + 9 + 6 = 28\n\n13. A-D-B-C-E: 11 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 32\n14. A-D-B-E-C: 11 + 6 + 10 + 8 = 35\n15. A-D-C-B-E: 11 + 12 + 7 + 8 = 38\n16.
