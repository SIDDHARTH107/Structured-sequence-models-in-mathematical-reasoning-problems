    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Find the number of possible groups for each prime factor using Sylow theorems.\n3. Combine the groups for each prime factor to find the total number of non-isomorphic groups.\n\nStep 1: Prime factorization\n120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n\nStep 2: Find the number of possible groups for each prime factor\nFor the prime factor 2 (with exponent 3), there are two possible groups: Cyclic group C_8 and the dihedral group D_4.\nFor the prime factor 3 (with exponent 1), there is only one possible group: Cyclic group C_3.\nFor the prime factor 5 (with exponent 1), there is only one possible group: Cyclic group C_5.\n\nStep 3: Combine the groups for each prime factor\nSince there are two possible groups for the prime factor 2 and one possible group for each of the prime factors 3 and 5, we can combine them in the following ways:\n\n1. C_8 x C_3 x C_5: This is a direct product of cyclic groups, which results in a cyclic group of order 120.\n2. D_4 x C_3 x C_5: This is a direct product of the dihedral group D_4 and the cyclic groups C_3 and C_5. This results in a non-abelian group of order 120.\n\nTherefore, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 120: the cyclic group C_120 and the non-abelian group D_4 x C_3 x C_5."
