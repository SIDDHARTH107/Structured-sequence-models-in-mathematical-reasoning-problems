    "message_1": "Suppose two players are playing the game of Nim with 7 piles of stones. The first pile contains 9 stones, the second pile contains 6 stones, the third pile contains 4 stones, the fourth pile contains 11 stones, the fifth pile contains 3 stones, the sixth pile contains 8 stones, and the seventh pile contains 5 stones. If the players take turns removing stones from any one pile (at least one stone must be removed per turn), and the player who removes the last stone wins the game, which player has the winning strategy?",
    "message_2": "To determine the winning strategy, we need to find the Nim-sum of the piles. The Nim-sum is found by taking the bitwise XOR of the number of stones in each pile. \n\nLet's calculate the Nim-sum:\n\n9 (1001 in binary)\n6 (0110 in binary)\n4 (0100 in binary)\n11 (1011 in binary)\n3 (0011 in binary)\n8 (1000 in binary)\n5 (0101 in binary)\n\nPerforming the bitwise XOR:\n\n1001\n0110\n0100\n1011\n0011\n1000\n0101\n------\n0000\n\nThe Nim-sum is 0, which means the current position is a losing position for the first player. Therefore, the second player has the winning strategy."
