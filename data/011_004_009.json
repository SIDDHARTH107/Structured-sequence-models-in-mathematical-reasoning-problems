    "message_1": "A small grocery has 6 different types of fruits to choose from, and a customer wants to buy 10 fruits. In how many ways can the customer choose the fruits if they want to buy at least 2 of each type of fruit?",
    "message_2": "Since the customer wants to buy at least 2 of each type of fruit, they will have to buy 2 fruits of each of the 6 types, which accounts for 12 fruits. However, they only want to buy 10 fruits in total. Therefore, we need to find a way to \"remove\" 2 fruits from the selection while still maintaining the condition of having at least 2 of each type.\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. Imagine the 10 fruits as 10 stars, and we need to divide them into 6 groups (each group representing a type of fruit). We will use 5 \"bars\" to separate the groups.\n\nSince we need to remove 2 fruits from the selection, we can think of it as adding 2 \"dummy\" fruits to the selection, and then removing them at the end. So, we will have 12 stars (10 real fruits + 2 dummy fruits) and 5 bars.\n\nNow, we need to arrange these 12 stars and 5 bars in a row. There are a total of 17 positions (12 stars + 5 bars), and we need to choose 5 positions for the bars. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 17 (total positions) and k = 5 (positions for the bars):\n\nC(17, 5) = 17! / (5!(17-5)!)\nC(17, 5) = 17! / (5!12!)\nC(17, 5) = (17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\nC(17, 5) = 6188\n\nSo, there are 6188 ways for the customer to choose the 10 fruits while buying at least 2 of each type of fruit."
