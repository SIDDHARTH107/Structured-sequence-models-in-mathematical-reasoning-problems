    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group of the surface given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0$, we first need to determine the topology of the surface. This equation defines a smooth algebraic surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which is known as the Fermat cubic surface.\n\nThe Fermat cubic surface is a non-singular surface, meaning it has no self-intersections or singular points. To determine its topology, we can use the fact that it is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of three complex projective planes, which can be denoted as $\\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# \\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# \\mathbb{CP}^2$. \n\nThe second cohomology group of a connected sum of manifolds is the direct sum of the second cohomology groups of the individual manifolds. The second cohomology group of a complex projective plane $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, so the second cohomology group of the Fermat cubic surface is given by:\n\n$H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# \\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# \\mathbb{CP}^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo, the second cohomology group of the Fermat cubic surface with $\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients is $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$."
