    "message_2": "In a transposition cipher, the key determines the number of columns in the grid used for encryption. In this case, the key is 7, so there will be 7 columns. To find the maximum length of the possible ciphertext, we need to determine how many rows are needed to accommodate the 35 characters in the message.\n\nTo do this, we can divide the message length by the key and round up to the nearest whole number:\n\n35 / 7 = 5\n\nSince 35 is exactly divisible by 7, there is no need to round up. So, there will be 5 rows in the grid. Now, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to find the maximum length of the ciphertext:\n\n5 rows * 7 columns = 35\n\nThe maximum length of the possible ciphertext is 35 characters."
