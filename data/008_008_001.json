    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of solving linear programming problems using matrix methods:\n\nA company manufactures two products: Product X and Product Y. Each unit of Product X requires 1 hour of machine time and 2 hours of labor, while each unit of Product Y requires 3 hours of machine time and 1 hour of labor. The company has 50 hours of machine time and 60 hours of labor available each day. Each unit of Product X yields a profit of \\$10, and each unit of Product Y yields a profit of \\$20. How many units of each product should the company produce each day to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this linear programming problem, we can use the simplex method. First, let's define the variables:\n\nLet x be the number of units of Product X produced daily.\nLet y be the number of units of Product Y produced daily.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP = 10x + 20y\n\nThe constraints are given by the available machine time and labor:\n\n1x + 3y ≤ 50 (machine time constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 60 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nNow, we will convert the inequalities into equalities by introducing slack variables s1 and s2:\n\n1x + 3y + s1 = 50\n2x + 1y + s2 = 60\nx, y, s1, s2 ≥ 0\n\nWe can now set up the initial simplex tableau:\n\n| 1  3  1  0 | 50 |\n| 2  1  0  1 | 60 |\n|-------------|----|\n|-10 -20  0  0 |  0 |\n\nNow, we will perform the simplex method:\n\n1. Choose the pivot column: The most negative entry in the bottom row is -20, so the pivot column is the second column.\n\n2. Choose the pivot row: Divide the right-hand side by the corresponding entry in the pivot column (ignoring negative or zero values). The smallest non-negative quotient is 50/3, so the pivot row is the first row.\n\n3. Make the pivot element 1: Divide the first row by 3.\n\n| 1/3  1  1/3  0 | 50/3 |\n|  2   1   0   1 |  60  |\n|----------------|-----|\n|-10 -20   0   0 |   0  |\n\n4. Make the other entries in the pivot column 0: Add 20 times the first row to the bottom row, and subtract the first row from the second row multiplied by the pivot column value (1).\n\n| 1/3   1  1/3  0 | 50/3 |\n| 5/3   0 -1/3  1 | 110/3|\n|----------------|-----|\n|  0    0   20/3 0 | 1000 |\n\n5. Since there are no more negative entries in the bottom row, we can read the solution from the tableau:\n\nx = 0\ny = 50/3 ≈ 16.67\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a product, the company should produce 16 units of Product Y and 0 units of Product X to maximize its profit. The maximum profit will be:\n\nP = 10(0) + 20(16) = \\$320."
