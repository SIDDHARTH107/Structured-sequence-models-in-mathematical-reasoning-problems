    "message_2": "To find the current i(t) through the circuit for t > 0, we first need to rewrite the given differential equation in terms of i(t) and its derivatives. Since Q = ∫i(t)dt, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time to eliminate Q:\n\ndQ/dt = i(t)\n\nNow, substitute this expression into the original differential equation:\n\nL(d²i/dt²) + R(di/dt) + (1/C)∫i(t)dt = Eω sin(ωt)\n\nNext, we can solve this second-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation using the method of undetermined coefficients. We will guess a particular solution of the form:\n\ni_p(t) = A sin(ωt) + B cos(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined. Differentiate i_p(t) with respect to time:\n\ndi_p/dt = ωA cos(ωt) - ωB sin(ωt)\n\nd²i_p/dt² = -ω²A sin(ωt) - ω²B cos(ωt)\n\nNow, substitute i_p(t), di_p/dt, and d²i_p/dt² into the differential equation:\n\nL(-ω²A sin(ωt) - ω²B cos(ωt)) + R(ωA cos(ωt) - ωB sin(ωt)) + (1/C)(A sin(ωt) + B cos(ωt)) = Eω sin(ωt)\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(ωt) and cos(ωt) on both sides of the equation, we get two equations:\n\n-ω²LA + ωRB + A/C = Eω  (1)\n-ω²LB - ωRA + B/C = 0     (2)\n\nSolve this system of linear equations for A and B:\n\nA = (EωC - ωRB) / (Lω² + 1/C)\nB = (ωRA) / (Lω² + 1/C)\n\nNow, we need to find the complementary solution i_c(t) of the homogeneous equation:\n\nL(d²i_c/dt²) + R(di_c/dt) + (1/C)∫i_c(t)dt = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\nLm² + Rm + 1/C = 0\n\nSolve for m:\n\nm = (-R ± √(R² - 4L/C)) / (2L)\n\nSince R² - 4L/C > 0, the roots are real and distinct. Let m1 and m2 be the roots. Then the complementary solution is:\n\ni_c(t) = C1 e^(m1t) + C2 e^(m2t)\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the particular and complementary solutions:\n\ni(t) = A sin(ωt) + B cos(ωt) + C1 e^(m1t) + C2 e^(m2t)\n\nTo find the constants C1 and C2, we use the initial conditions:\n\nQ(0) = 0 => ∫i(t)dt = 0 => A = 0\ni(0) = 0 => B + C1 + C2 = 0\n\nSolve for C1 and C2:\n\nC1 = -B - C2\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for A, B, C1, and C2 back into the general solution:\n\ni(t) = (EωC - ωRB) / (Lω² + 1/C) sin(ωt) + (ωRA) / (Lω² + 1/C) cos(ωt) - (ωRA) / (Lω² + 1/C) e^(m1t) - (ωRA - B) / (Lω² + 1/C) e^(m2t)\n\nThis is the current i(t) through the circuit for t > 0 with the initial charge on the capacitor Q(0) = 0."
