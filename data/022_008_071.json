    "message_2": "We will use Liouville's theorem to solve this problem. Liouville's theorem states that every bounded entire function must be constant.\n\nFirst, let's consider the function g(z) = f(z) / (z^4 + 1). Since f(z) is entire, g(z) is also entire. We know that |f(z)| ≤ |z|^4 + 25 for all z ∈ ℂ. Therefore, we have:\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z) / (z^4 + 1)| ≤ (|z|^4 + 25) / (|z|^4 + 1) ≤ 1 + 25 / (|z|^4 + 1)\n\nAs |z| → ∞, the right-hand side of the inequality approaches 1. Thus, g(z) is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, g(z) must be constant. Let c be this constant, so g(z) = c for all z ∈ ℂ.\n\nNow, let's find the polynomial p(z). We have:\n\nf(z) = g(z)(z^4 + 1) = c(z^4 + 1)\n\nSince |f(z) - p(z)| ≤ 10 for all z ∈ ℂ, we want to find a constant c such that |f(z) - c(z^4 + 1)| ≤ 10. We can rewrite this inequality as:\n\n|f(z) - c(z^4 + 1)| = |g(z)(z^4 + 1) - c(z^4 + 1)| = |(g(z) - c)(z^4 + 1)|\n\nSince g(z) is constant, |g(z) - c| is also constant. Let's denote this constant by K. Then, we have:\n\n|(g(z) - c)(z^4 + 1)| = K|z^4 + 1|\n\nWe want K|z^4 + 1| ≤ 10 for all z ∈ ℂ. Since K is constant, we can choose K = 10. Thus, we have:\n\n|f(z) - c(z^4 + 1)| = 10|z^4 + 1| ≤ 10\n\nSo, the polynomial p(z) = c(z^4 + 1) satisfies the given condition, where c is the constant value of the function g(z)."
