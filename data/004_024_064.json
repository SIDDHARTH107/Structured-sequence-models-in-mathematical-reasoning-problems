    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line at the point (1, 2), we need to find the derivative dy/dx. We'll differentiate the given equation implicitly with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nGiven equation: x^2 + xy + y^3 = 8\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (xy) + d/dx (y^3) = d/dx (8)\n\nUsing the chain rule and product rule:\n\n(2x) + (1 * y + x * dy/dx) + (3y^2 * dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we'll solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx (x + 3y^2) = -2x - y\n\ndy/dx = (-2x - y) / (x + 3y^2)\n\nNow, we'll plug in the point (1, 2) into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = (-2(1) - 2) / (1 + 3(2)^2)\n\ndy/dx = (-4) / (1 + 12)\n\ndy/dx = -4 / 13\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (1, 2) is -4/13."
