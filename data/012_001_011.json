    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between nodes A and F, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or simply analyze the graph visually. Here's the graph with the weights on the edges:\n\n```\nA--1--B--5--C\n|     |\\   |\n2     3 \\  |4\n|       \\ |\nD--7-----E--6--F\n```\n\nWe can see that the shortest path from A to F is A -> B -> E -> F, with a total weight of 1 + 3 + 6 = 10."
