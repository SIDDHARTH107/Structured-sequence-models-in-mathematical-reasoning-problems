    "message_2": "Proof that G has at least one cyclic subgroup of order 3 and one cyclic subgroup of order 4:\n\nSince the order of G is 36, by the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups of G. Let's denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3 and the number of Sylow 2-subgroups as n_2.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that n_3 divides 36/3 = 12 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 12. Similarly, n_2 divides 36/4 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nNow, let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 3, which is prime, P is cyclic. Thus, G has a cyclic subgroup of order 3.\n\nSimilarly, let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since the order of Q is 4, which is a power of the prime 2, Q has a cyclic subgroup of order 4 (either Q itself is cyclic, or it has a cyclic subgroup of order 4). Thus, G has a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n\nNow, we will show that there exist three distinct groups of order 36 that satisfy this property:\n\n1. C_36: The cyclic group of order 36 has a cyclic subgroup of order 3 and a cyclic subgroup of order 4. It is isomorphic to itself.\n\n2. A_4 × C_3: The direct product of the alternating group of degree 4 (order 12) and the cyclic group of order 3 has order 36. A_4 has a cyclic subgroup of order 3 (generated by a 3-cycle), and C_3 is a cyclic group of order 3. A_4 has a cyclic subgroup of order 4 (generated by a product of two 2-cycles), and C_3 has a trivial subgroup of order 1. Thus, A_4 × C_3 has a cyclic subgroup of order 3 and a cyclic subgroup of order 4. It is isomorphic to itself.\n\n3. One of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36: Let G be a non-abelian group of order 36 with a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup Q. Since P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G. Thus, G is a semidirect product of P and Q. By the above proof, G has a cyclic subgroup of order 3 and a cyclic subgroup of order 4. One example of such a group is the semidirect product of C_3 and C_4, where the non-trivial element of C_3 acts on C_4 by inversion.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that G has at least one cyclic subgroup of order 3 and one cyclic subgroup of order 4, and we have provided three distinct groups of order 36 that satisfy this property. We have also determined an isomorphism between each of these groups and A_4 × C_3, C_36, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
