    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = 2e^(-2x) for x ≥ 0, we will use the following definition of the one-sided Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-jωx)] dx, where the integral is taken from 0 to infinity, j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1), and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 2e^(-2x). Let's compute the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[2e^(-2x) * e^(-jωx)] dx, with the integral taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = 2∫[e^(-2x - jωx)] dx, with the integral taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the exponent as:\n\nF(ω) = 2∫[e^(-x(2 + jω))] dx, with the integral taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nThis is an integral of the form ∫[e^(-ax)] dx, which can be solved using integration by substitution or by recognizing it as a standard integral. The result is:\n\n∫[e^(-ax)] dx = -1/a * e^(-ax) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nApplying this to our integral, we get:\n\nF(ω) = 2[-1/(2 + jω) * e^(-x(2 + jω))] evaluated from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limits:\n\nAs x approaches infinity, e^(-x(2 + jω)) approaches 0, because the exponential term with a negative real part will decay to 0.\n\nAt x = 0, e^(-x(2 + jω)) = e^(0) = 1.\n\nSo, F(ω) = 2[-1/(2 + jω) * (0 - 1)] = 2/(2 + jω).\n\nThus, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 2e^(-2x) for x ≥ 0 is F(ω) = 2/(2 + jω). This is the frequency domain representation of f(x)."
