    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel with a diameter of 40 meters spins at a constant rate, taking 3 minutes to complete one full revolution. At a distance of 12 meters from the center of the Ferris wheel, what is the maximum height above the ground that a passenger reaches during one cycle? (Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a meter.)",
    "message_2": "The radius of the Ferris wheel is half of its diameter, so the radius is 20 meters. When a passenger is at the highest point on the Ferris wheel, they are at a distance equal to the radius of the wheel above the ground. \n\nSince the passenger is 12 meters from the center of the Ferris wheel, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the passenger above the ground when they are at the highest point.\n\nLet h be the height above the ground, and let r be the radius of the Ferris wheel (20 meters). Then, we have:\n\nh^2 + 12^2 = 20^2\nh^2 + 144 = 400\nh^2 = 256\nh = âˆš256\nh = 16 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height above the ground that a passenger reaches during one cycle is 16 meters."
