    "message_1": "Consider a double pendulum with equal lengths of L = 1 meter and masses of m1 = 1 kg and m2 = 1 kg. Initially, the pendulum is released from a position where the upper angle is 45° and the lower angle is 0°. Calculate the maximum height reached by the upper mass during its motion.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height reached by the upper mass (m1) during its motion, we need to first determine the initial potential energy of the system and then find the height at which all of this potential energy is converted into gravitational potential energy for m1.\n\nInitially, the height of m1 above the ground can be calculated using the sine function and the given angle of 45°:\n\nh1_initial = L * sin(45°) = 1 * sin(45°) = 1 * (1/√2) = √2/2 meters\n\nThe height of m2 above the ground is equal to the length of the pendulum (L) since the lower angle is 0°:\n\nh2_initial = L = 1 meter\n\nNow, we can calculate the initial potential energy of the system:\n\nPE_initial = m1 * g * h1_initial + m2 * g * h2_initial\nPE_initial = 1 * 9.81 * (√2/2) + 1 * 9.81 * 1\nPE_initial ≈ 4.905 + 9.81 = 14.715 Joules\n\nAt the maximum height, all of the initial potential energy will be converted into gravitational potential energy for m1. The height of m2 will be 0, as it will be at the bottom of its swing. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\nPE_initial = m1 * g * h1_max\n\nSolving for h1_max:\n\nh1_max = PE_initial / (m1 * g)\nh1_max = 14.715 / (1 * 9.81)\nh1_max ≈ 1.5 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height reached by the upper mass (m1) during its motion is approximately 1.5 meters above the ground."
