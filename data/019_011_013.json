    "message_2": "Let's assume that 10x is divisible by 3, which means there exists an integer k such that:\n\n10x = 3k\n\nNow, we can rewrite 10x as:\n\n10x = 3k = 3(3n) + 3m, where n and m are integers.\n\nThis is because any multiple of 3 can be written as 3 times an integer.\n\nNow, let's factor out the 3:\n\n10x = 3(3n + m)\n\nSince 10x is divisible by 3, we know that (3n + m) must be an integer. Let's call this integer p:\n\n10x = 3p\n\nNow, we want to show that x is also divisible by 3. We can rewrite x as:\n\nx = 10x / 10\n\nSubstitute the expression for 10x that we found earlier:\n\nx = (3p) / 10\n\nNow, we know that 3p is divisible by 3 since it's a multiple of 3. We also know that 10 is not divisible by 3, as 3 does not evenly divide into 10. However, since the product 3p is divisible by 3, and 10 is not divisible by 3, the only way for their quotient (x) to be an integer is if p is divisible by 3 as well.\n\nLet's assume p = 3q, where q is an integer. Then:\n\nx = (3p) / 10 = (3(3q)) / 10 = 3q\n\nSince x = 3q, where q is an integer, we have shown that x must be divisible by 3 as well."
