    "message_1": "A triangle has one angle of 35 degrees and a side opposite to it of length 12 cm. The angle opposite to the base of the triangle is 60 degrees. Find the length of the other two sides of the triangle using the law of sines.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the triangle as ABC, where angle A is 35 degrees, angle B is 60 degrees, and side a is opposite angle A with length 12 cm. We need to find the lengths of sides b and c.\n\nFirst, we need to find the third angle, angle C. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\nangle C = 180 - angle A - angle B\nangle C = 180 - 35 - 60\nangle C = 85 degrees\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the lengths of sides b and c. The law of sines states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is the same for all three sides of the triangle:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe already know the values for a and angle A, so we can use those to find the lengths of sides b and c.\n\nFor side b:\n\n12 / sin(35) = b / sin(60)\nb = (12 * sin(60)) / sin(35)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nb ≈ 15.47 cm\n\nFor side c:\n\n12 / sin(35) = c / sin(85)\nc = (12 * sin(85)) / sin(35)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nc ≈ 19.95 cm\n\nSo, the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle are approximately 15.47 cm and 19.95 cm."
