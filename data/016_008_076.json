    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve remains the same regardless of the number of iterations. To find the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each segment is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. Therefore, N = 4 and M = 3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619, regardless of the number of iterations."
