    "message_1": "Suppose a school has 120 students who are taking a math course. If the probability of a student passing the course is 0.85, what is the probability that at least 100 students will pass?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 100 students will pass, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, students passing the course)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of students, which is 120)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of students passing the course)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a student passing the course, which is 0.85)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a student not passing the course, which is 0.15)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 100 students will pass, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for 100, 101, 102, ..., 120 students passing the course. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nP(X >= 100) = P(X = 100) + P(X = 101) + ... + P(X = 120)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 100) = Σ [C(120, k) * 0.85^k * 0.15^(120-k)] for k = 100 to 120\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 100) ≈ 0.986\n\nSo, the probability that at least 100 students will pass the math course is approximately 0.986 or 98.6%."
