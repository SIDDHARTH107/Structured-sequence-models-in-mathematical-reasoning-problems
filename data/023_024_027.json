    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x), we need to determine the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ using the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to L (L is half the period)\naₙ = (2/L) * ∫[f(x)cos(nx)dx] from 0 to L\nbₙ = (2/L) * ∫[f(x)sin(nx)dx] from 0 to L\n\nIn this case, L = π, since the period is 2π.\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [∫(5dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-3dx) from π to 2π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [5x | from 0 to π - 3x | from π to 2π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [(5π - 0) - (6π - 3π)]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * (5π - 3π)\n\na₀ = 2\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (2/π) * [∫(5cos(nx)dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-3cos(nx)dx) from π to 2π]\n\naₙ = (2/π) * [(5/n)sin(nx) | from 0 to π - (-3/n)sin(nx) | from π to 2π]\n\naₙ = (2/π) * [(5/n)(sin(nπ) - sin(0)) + (3/n)(sin(2nπ) - sin(nπ))]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, aₙ = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [∫(5sin(nx)dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-3sin(nx)dx) from π to 2π]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [(-5/n)cos(nx) | from 0 to π + (3/n)cos(nx) | from π to 2π]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [(-5/n)(cos(nπ) - cos(0)) + (3/n)(cos(2nπ) - cos(nπ))]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [(-5/n)(-1)^n + 5/n + 3/n - 3/n(-1)^n]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [(5/n)((-1)^n - 1) + (3/n)(1 - (-1)^n)]\n\nNow we have all the coefficients, so we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ[aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)] from n=1 to infinity\n\nf(x) = 2 + Σ[0*cos(nx) + (2/π)[(5/n)((-1)^n - 1) + (3/n)(1 - (-1)^n)]sin(nx)] from n=1 to infinity\n\nf(x) = 2 + (2/π)Σ[(5/n)((-1)^n - 1) + (3/n)(1 - (-1)^n)]sin(nx) from n=1 to infinity"
