    "message_1": "A math student is asked to apply the Fourier transform to solve the following problem in quantum mechanics:\n\nA particle in a one-dimensional potential well of width L is described by the wavefunction y(x)=Acos(2πx/L) inside the well and y(x)=0 outside the well. Find the momentum space wavefunction using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To find the momentum space wavefunction, we need to apply the Fourier transform to the given wavefunction y(x). The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nΨ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) ∫ y(x) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx\n\nwhere Ψ(p) is the momentum space wavefunction, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and the integral is taken over all space. Since y(x) = 0 outside the well, we only need to integrate over the well, from 0 to L:\n\nΨ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) ∫[0 to L] Acos(2πx/L) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve this integral. We can use integration by parts, with u = cos(2πx/L) and dv = e^(-ipx/ħ) dx. Then, du = -(2π/L)sin(2πx/L) dx and v = (-iħ/p)e^(-ipx/ħ). Applying integration by parts:\n\nΨ(p) = (A/√(2πħ)) [(-iħ/p) ∫ cos(2πx/L) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx + (2π/L) ∫ sin(2πx/L) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx]\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second term again by parts, with u = sin(2πx/L) and dv = e^(-ipx/ħ) dx. Then, du = (2π/L)cos(2πx/L) dx and v = (-iħ/p)e^(-ipx/ħ). Applying integration by parts again:\n\nΨ(p) = (A/√(2πħ)) [(-iħ/p) ∫ cos(2πx/L) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx + (2π/L)(-iħ/p) ∫ sin(2πx/L) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx - (2π/L)^2 ∫ cos(2πx/L) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx]\n\nNow, we have two similar integrals on both sides of the equation. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the integral:\n\nΨ(p) = (A/√(2πħ)) [(iħ/p)^2 + (2π/L)^2] ∫ cos(2πx/L) e^(-ipx/ħ) dx\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nΨ(p) = (A/√(2πħ)) [(iħ/p)^2 + (2π/L)^2] [(L/2π)(sin(2πx/L)e^(-ipx/ħ))|₀^L]\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nΨ(p) = (A/√(2πħ)) [(iħ/p)^2 + (2π/L)^2] [(L/2π)(sin(2πL/L)e^(-ipL/ħ) - sin(0)e^(-ip(0)/ħ))]\n\nΨ(p) = (A/√(2πħ)) [(iħ/p)^2 + (2π/L)^2] [(L/2π)(sin(2π)e^(-ipL/ħ) - 0)]\n\nFinally, we have the momentum space wavefunction:\n\nΨ(p) = (AL/2π√(2πħ)) [(iħ/p)^2 + (2π/L)^2] sin(2π)e^(-ipL/ħ)"
