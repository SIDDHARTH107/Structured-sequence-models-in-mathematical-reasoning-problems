    "message_1": "A company produces bottles of juice and claims that the average volume of each bottle is 500 mL with a standard deviation of 10 mL. A sample of 50 bottles is taken and the average volume of these bottles turns out to be 495 mL. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true average volume of these bottles.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true average volume of these bottles, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± Z * (σ / √n)\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nGiven:\nx̄ = 495 mL (sample mean)\nσ = 10 mL (population standard deviation)\nn = 50 (sample size)\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval. For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (which corresponds to the critical value that separates the middle 95% of the distribution from the tails).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 495 ± 1.96 * (10 / √50)\n\nCI = 495 ± 1.96 * (10 / 7.071)\n\nCI = 495 ± 1.96 * 1.414\n\nCI = 495 ± 2.77\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average volume of these bottles is (492.23 mL, 497.77 mL). This means that we can be 95% confident that the true average volume of the bottles produced by the company lies between 492.23 mL and 497.77 mL."
