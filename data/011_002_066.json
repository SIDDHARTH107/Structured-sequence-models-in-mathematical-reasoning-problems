    "message_2": "To find the 8th term in the expansion of (x + y)^11, we will use the binomial theorem, which states that:\n\n(x + y)^n = C(n, 0)x^n + C(n, 1)x^(n-1)y + C(n, 2)x^(n-2)y^2 + ... + C(n, n)y^n\n\nwhere C(n, r) is the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time, also known as \"n choose r\" or the binomial coefficient. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n - r)!)\n\nFor the 8th term, r = 7 (since the first term corresponds to r = 0). So, we need to find the coefficient C(11, 7) and the corresponding powers of x and y.\n\nC(11, 7) = 11! / (7!(11 - 7)!) = 11! / (7!4!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n11! = 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 39916800\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nNow, let's plug these factorials into the formula for C(11, 7):\n\nC(11, 7) = 39916800 / (5040 × 24) = 330\n\nNow that we have the binomial coefficient, let's find the corresponding powers of x and y:\n\nx^(11 - 7) = x^4\ny^7\n\nSo, the 8th term in the expansion of (x + y)^11 is:\n\n330x^4y^7"
