    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess for the eigenvector, x^(0) = [1; 1].\n2. Compute the next approximation of the eigenvector by multiplying the matrix A by the current eigenvector approximation: x^(k+1) = A * x^(k).\n3. Normalize the resulting vector: x^(k+1) = x^(k+1) / ||x^(k+1)||.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's perform a few iterations to get an approximation:\n\nIteration 1:\nx^(1) = A * x^(0) = [5 2; 2 8] * [1; 1] = [7; 10]\nNormalize x^(1): x^(1) = [7/√149; 10/√149] ≈ [0.573; 0.820]\n\nIteration 2:\nx^(2) = A * x^(1) ≈ [5 2; 2 8] * [0.573; 0.820] ≈ [3.639; 7.300]\nNormalize x^(2): x^(2) ≈ [3.639/√62.885; 7.300/√62.885] ≈ [0.457; 0.889]\n\nIteration 3:\nx^(3) = A * x^(2) ≈ [5 2; 2 8] * [0.457; 0.889] ≈ [3.283; 7.551]\nNormalize x^(3): x^(3) ≈ [3.283/√64.725; 7.551/√64.725] ≈ [0.408; 0.939]\n\nWe can see that the eigenvector is converging. Let's compute the dominant eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nλ1 ≈ (x^(3)' * A * x^(3)) / (x^(3)' * x^(3))\nλ1 ≈ ([0.408; 0.939] * [5 2; 2 8] * [0.408; 0.939]) / ([0.408; 0.939] * [0.408; 0.939])\nλ1 ≈ 9.000\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue λ1 is approximately 9.000, and its corresponding eigenvector x1 is approximately [0.408; 0.939]. These results are rounded to 3 decimal places."
