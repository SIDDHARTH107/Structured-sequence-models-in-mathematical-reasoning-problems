    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 12 cm. What is its total surface area in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length × width): 8 cm × 5 cm = 40 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 40 cm² × 2 = 80 cm².\n\n2. The area of the second pair of opposite faces (length × height): 8 cm × 12 cm = 96 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 96 cm² × 2 = 192 cm².\n\n3. The area of the third pair of opposite faces (width × height): 5 cm × 12 cm = 60 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 60 cm² × 2 = 120 cm².\n\nNow, add the combined areas of all three pairs of faces: 80 cm² + 192 cm² + 120 cm² = 392 cm².\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 392 square centimeters."
