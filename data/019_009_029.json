    "message_2": "In Intuitionistic Logic, we have the following rules for implication and negation:\n\n1. A -> B is true if and only if either A is false or B is true.\n2. ~A is true if and only if A is false.\n\nGiven p = 1, q = 0, and r = 1, let's evaluate the formula ~(p -> q) v (q -> r) v (r -> p):\n\n1. p -> q: Since p = 1 and q = 0, this implication is false (1 -> 0 is false).\n2. q -> r: Since q = 0 and r = 1, this implication is true (0 -> 1 is true).\n3. r -> p: Since r = 1 and p = 1, this implication is true (1 -> 1 is true).\n4. ~(p -> q): Since p -> q is false, the negation is true (~false is true).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the disjunctions:\n\n1. ~(p -> q) v (q -> r): Since ~(p -> q) is true and (q -> r) is true, this disjunction is true (true v true is true).\n2. (q -> r) v (r -> p): Since (q -> r) is true and (r -> p) is true, this disjunction is true (true v true is true).\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the entire formula:\n\n1. ~(p -> q) v (q -> r) v (r -> p): Since all the disjunctions are true, the entire formula is true (true v true v true is true).\n\nSo, the truth value of the formula ~(p -> q) v (q -> r) v (r -> p) when p = 1, q = 0, and r = 1 in Intuitionistic Logic is true."
