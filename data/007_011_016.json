In this case, we are looking for quadratic residues modulo 7.\n\nWe will check the squares of the integers from 0 to 6 (since we are working modulo 7) and reduce them modulo 7.\n\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n4^2 ≡ 16 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n6^2 ≡ 36 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues modulo 7 are {0, 1, 2, 4}."
