    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how a Feistel cipher works. A Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers. It consists of several rounds where each round uses a substitution and permutation process. In this case, we have a 16-bit plaintext and 6 rounds of encryption with a 10-bit key.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to encrypt the plaintext using the Feistel cipher:\n\n1. Divide the 16-bit plaintext into two equal halves: L0 (left half) and R0 (right half).\n   L0 = 10110101\n   R0 = 11110001\n\n2. For each round i (1 to 6), perform the following steps:\n   a. Calculate the round key Ki using the given key (1100101101). In this problem, we don't have information about the key scheduling algorithm, so we will assume the key remains the same for each round.\n   b. Apply the Feistel function F(Ri-1, Ki) to the right half of the data (Ri-1) and the round key Ki. The Feistel function is not provided in this problem, so we cannot compute the exact output.\n   c. XOR the output of the Feistel function with the left half of the data (Li-1) to get the new left half Li.\n   d. The new right half Ri is the same as the previous left half Li-1.\n   e. Repeat steps a to d for all 6 rounds.\n\n3. After the last round, combine the left and right halves (L6 and R6) to get the 16-bit ciphertext.\n\nSince we don't have the Feistel function and key scheduling algorithm, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext. However, this is the general process you would follow to encrypt the plaintext using a Feistel cipher with the given parameters."
