    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 8cm, b = 12cm, and angle C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\n60 degrees * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow we can apply the Law of Cosines:\n\nc² = 8² + 12² - 2 * 8 * 12 * cos(π/3)\nc² = 64 + 144 - 192 * (1/2)\nc² = 208 - 96\nc² = 112\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √112 ≈ 10.58cm\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 8 + 12 + 10.58\nPerimeter ≈ 30.58cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 30.58cm."
