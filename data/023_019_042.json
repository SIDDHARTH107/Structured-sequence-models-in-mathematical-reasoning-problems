    "message_1": "Suppose a linear system is described by the differential equation: y''(t) + 3y'(t) +2y(t) = x(t), where y is the system output and x is the system input. Use the Fourier transform to analyze the stability of this system. For which values of ω is the system stable? If the input signal is x(t) = 3cos(2t) + 2sin(3t), what is the steady state response of the system for t → ∞?",
    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the system, we first need to find the transfer function H(ω) of the system. We do this by taking the Fourier transform of the given differential equation.\n\nThe Fourier transform of y''(t) is (jω)^2Y(ω), the Fourier transform of y'(t) is jωY(ω), and the Fourier transform of y(t) is Y(ω). The Fourier transform of x(t) is X(ω). So, the transformed equation is:\n\n(jω)^2Y(ω) + 3(jω)Y(ω) + 2Y(ω) = X(ω)\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) by solving for Y(ω)/X(ω):\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω)/X(ω) = 1/((jω)^2 + 3(jω) + 2)\n\nH(ω) = 1/(ω^2 - j3ω + 2)\n\nTo analyze the stability of the system, we need to check if the poles of the transfer function have negative real parts. The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator is zero:\n\nω^2 - j3ω + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in ω. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nω = (3j ± √(9j^2 - 4*2))/2 = (3j ± √(5j^2))/2\n\nSince the real parts of the roots are zero, the system is marginally stable.\n\nNow, let's find the steady-state response of the system for the given input signal x(t) = 3cos(2t) + 2sin(3t). The Fourier transform of x(t) is:\n\nX(ω) = 3π[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] + j2π[δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of the output signal Y(ω) by multiplying X(ω) with the transfer function H(ω):\n\nY(ω) = H(ω)X(ω) = 3πH(2)[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] + j2πH(3)[δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)]\n\nNow, we take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to find the steady-state response y(t):\n\ny(t) = 3H(2)cos(2t) + 2H(3)sin(3t)\n\nWe already have the transfer function H(ω):\n\nH(ω) = 1/(ω^2 - j3ω + 2)\n\nNow, we can find H(2) and H(3):\n\nH(2) = 1/(2^2 - j3*2 + 2) = 1/(2 - 6j)\nH(3) = 1/(3^2 - j3*3 + 2) = 1/(7 - 9j)\n\nSo, the steady-state response y(t) is:\n\ny(t) = 3(1/(2 - 6j))cos(2t) + 2(1/(7 - 9j))sin(3t)\n\ny(t) = (3/40 + 9/40j)cos(2t) + (2/130 + 6/130j)sin(3t)\n\nAs t → ∞, the steady-state response y(t) remains the same since the system is marginally stable."
