    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In this problem, we have a simple graph G with 8 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of 3.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of edges in the graph. Since each vertex has a degree of 3, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 8 * 3 = 24. According to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges, so the graph has 24 / 2 = 12 edges.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible girths of the graph:\n\n1. Girth 3 (a triangle): If the girth is 3, then there must be a cycle of length 3 in the graph. In this case, we can start by forming a triangle with 3 vertices and 3 edges. We still have 5 vertices left to connect, and each of these vertices must have a degree of 3. However, we can't add these 5 vertices without creating a cycle shorter than 3, which contradicts the girth being 3.\n\n2. Girth 4 (a square): If the girth is 4, then there must be a cycle of length 4 in the graph. In this case, we can form a square with 4 vertices and 4 edges. We still have 4 vertices left to connect, and each of these vertices must have a degree of 3. We can connect each of the remaining vertices to two vertices of the square, forming 4 cycles of length 4. In this case, we have a total of 12 edges, which matches the number of edges in the graph.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph G is 4."
