    "message_1": "A delivery company has to deliver a package to a customer's house, which is located at a distance of 10 km from the company's warehouse. The company has three delivery trucks available, each with a maximum travel distance of 8 km before refueling. What is the optimal routing strategy that the company should use to deliver the package to the customer's house if each truck has a fuel capacity of 40 km and the cost of refueling per kilometer is $0.50? What is the minimum cost of delivering the package?",
    "message_2": "Since each truck can only travel a maximum of 8 km before refueling, none of the trucks can make the 10 km trip to the customer's house without refueling. To minimize the cost, we can use a relay strategy where each truck covers a portion of the distance.\n\nLet's divide the 10 km distance into segments for each truck:\n\nTruck 1: 0 km to 4 km\nTruck 2: 4 km to 8 km\nTruck 3: 8 km to 10 km\n\nThis way, each truck will travel a distance within its maximum travel distance before refueling:\n\nTruck 1: 4 km\nTruck 2: 4 km\nTruck 3: 2 km\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of delivering the package:\n\nTruck 1: 4 km * $0.50 = $2.00\nTruck 2: 4 km * $0.50 = $2.00\nTruck 3: 2 km * $0.50 = $1.00\n\nTotal cost: $2.00 + $2.00 + $1.00 = $5.00\n\nThe optimal routing strategy is to use a relay system with the trucks covering 4 km, 4 km, and 2 km segments, and the minimum cost of delivering the package is $5.00."
