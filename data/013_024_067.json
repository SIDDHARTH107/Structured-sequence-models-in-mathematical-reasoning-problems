    "message_1": "Let's say there are 5 volunteers who are assigned to complete a common task. Each volunteer has the option to either show up and work on the task or skip the task entirely. If all 5 volunteers show up, the task will take 10 hours to complete. However, if only 4 volunteers show up, it will take 15 hours to complete the task. If only 3 volunteers show up, it will take 20 hours to complete the task. For each volunteer who shows up, they will receive a reward of $15.\n\nThe question: Suppose you are one of the volunteers. How many hours will it take to complete the task if you decide to skip the task? Also, assuming that all the other volunteers show up, what will be your reward?",
    "message_2": "If you decide to skip the task and all the other volunteers show up, there will be 4 volunteers working on the task. In this scenario, it will take 15 hours to complete the task.\n\nAssuming that all the other volunteers show up, your reward will be $0 since you did not participate in completing the task. The other 4 volunteers who showed up will each receive $15."
