    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(5x)/dx + d(2)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 2x^(2-1) - 5 * 1x^(1-1) + 0\nf'(x) = 6x - 5\n\nNow, we will find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 5\nf'(2) = 12 - 5\nf'(2) = 7\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 at x = 2 is 7."
