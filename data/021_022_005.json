    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the behavior of fireflies. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, for this particular problem, we can easily find the minimum value using calculus. But, let's try to solve it using the firefly algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the fireflies\nLet's assume we have 10 fireflies, and their initial positions (x values) are randomly distributed over the interval [0, 10]. We will also assign an initial brightness value to each firefly based on the function f(x).\n\nStep 2: Define attractiveness and update rules\nThe attractiveness of a firefly is proportional to its brightness. We will use the following update rules for position and brightness:\n\n1. If the brightness of firefly i is greater than the brightness of firefly j, firefly j will move towards firefly i.\n2. The attractiveness decreases as the distance between fireflies increases.\n3. The brightness of a firefly is determined by the value of the function f(x) at its position.\n\nStep 3: Iteratively update the fireflies' positions and brightness\nWe will perform a predefined number of iterations (e.g., 100) to update the fireflies' positions and brightness. In each iteration, we will:\n\n1. Calculate the distance between each pair of fireflies.\n2. Update the attractiveness based on the distance.\n3. Move the less bright fireflies towards the brighter ones.\n4. Update the brightness of each firefly based on its new position.\n\nStep 4: Find the minimum value\nAfter the iterations, the fireflies will converge to the minimum value of the function. We will select the firefly with the highest brightness, and its position will correspond to the minimum value of the function f(x).\n\nNote that the firefly algorithm is a stochastic method, and the solution may not be the exact minimum value. However, it should be close to the true minimum. In this case, the true minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 16x + 32 can be found using calculus, and it occurs at x = 4, with a minimum value of f(4) = 0."
