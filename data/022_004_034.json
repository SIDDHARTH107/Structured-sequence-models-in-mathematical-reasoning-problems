    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole and the residue of the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1) / (z^2 + 2z + 1)^2 at the singular point z = -1, we first need to rewrite the function in a more convenient form.\n\nWe can factor the numerator as follows:\n\nz^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)\n\nNow, we rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) / (z + 1)^4\n\nNow, we can see that f(z) has a pole at z = -1. To find the order of the pole, we need to find the smallest integer n such that the function (z + 1)^n f(z) is analytic and nonzero at z = -1.\n\nLet's try n = 1:\n\n(z + 1)f(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) / (z + 1)^3\n\nThis function is still not analytic at z = -1, so we try n = 2:\n\n(z + 1)^2 f(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) / (z + 1)^2\n\nNow, this function is analytic at z = -1, so the order of the pole is 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the residue of f(z) at z = -1. Since the order of the pole is 2, we can find the residue by calculating the limit:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1)^2 f(z)]\n\n= lim (z -> -1) [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) / (z + 1)^2]\n\n= lim (z -> -1) [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)]\n\n= (-2)(2) = -4\n\nSo, the order of the pole is 2, and the residue of the function f(z) at the singular point z = -1 is -4."
