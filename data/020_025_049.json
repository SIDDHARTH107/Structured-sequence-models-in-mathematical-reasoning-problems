The distance between each location is as follows:\n\n- A to B: 5 miles\n- A to C: 6 miles\n- A to D: 7 miles\n- B to C: 4 miles\n- B to D: 3 miles\n- C to D: 2 miles\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the delivery truck to take in order to minimize its total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then choose the one with the shortest distance.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible routes since there are 3 remaining locations after the starting point:\n\n1. A → B → C → D\n2. A → B → D → C\n3. A → C → B → D\n4. A → C → D → B\n5. A → D → B → C\n6. A → D → C → B\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. A → B → C → D: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 miles\n2. A → B → D → C: 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 miles\n3. A → C → B → D: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 miles\n4. A → C → D → B: 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 miles\n5. A → D → B → C: 7 + 3 + 4 = 14 miles\n6. A → D → C → B: 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 miles\n\nThe shortest route is Route 2 (A → B → D → C) with a total distance of 10 miles."
