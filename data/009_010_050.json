    "message_2": "To find the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to use the Black-Scholes formula for the price of a European call option:\n\n$C(S, t) = SN(d_1) - Ke^{-rt}N(d_2)$\n\nwhere $C(S, t)$ is the price of the call option, $S$ is the stock price, $t$ is the time to expiration, $N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are given by:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{S}{K}) + (r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})t}{\\sigma\\sqrt{t}}$\n\n$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{t}$\n\nWe are given the current stock price $S_0 = 100$, the strike price $K = 105$, the volatility $\\sigma = 0.2$, and the risk-free interest rate $r = 0.05$. We also need to know the time to expiration $t$. Let's assume the time to expiration is 1 year, so $t = 1$.\n\nNow we can calculate $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{100}{105}) + (0.05 + \\frac{0.2^2}{2})(1)}{0.2\\sqrt{1}} \\approx -0.1061$\n\n$d_2 = -0.1061 - 0.2\\sqrt{1} \\approx -0.3061$\n\nNow we can find the cumulative distribution function values $N(d_1)$ and $N(d_2)$:\n\n$N(d_1) \\approx 0.4576$\n\n$N(d_2) \\approx 0.3796$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the price of the call option:\n\n$C(100, 1) = 100(0.4576) - 105e^{-0.05}(0.3796) \\approx 45.76 - 39.81 \\approx 5.95$\n\nSo the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation is approximately $5.95."
