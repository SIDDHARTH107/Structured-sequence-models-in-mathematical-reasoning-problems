    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has 35 elements. Since 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers, we can apply the Sylow theorems to determine the structure of the group.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup in the group. Let's denote these subgroups as P and Q, respectively, where |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nNow, we can apply the Sylow theorems to find the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted as n_5, must divide the index [G:P] = 7, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1.\n\n2. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, denoted as n_7, must divide the index [G:Q] = 5, and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they are both normal subgroups of the group. Let's denote the group as G. Then, we have:\n\nP ⊲ G and Q ⊲ G\n\nSince P and Q are both normal subgroups and their orders are coprime (5 and 7 are prime and distinct), their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of the group.\n\nNow, we can apply the internal direct product theorem, which states that if two normal subgroups have a trivial intersection, then the group is the internal direct product of these subgroups. Therefore, the structure of the group of order 35 is:\n\nG ≅ P × Q\n\nSince the orders of P and Q are prime, they are both cyclic groups. Thus, we can write:\n\nP ≅ Z_5 and Q ≅ Z_7\n\nSo, the structure of the group of order 35 is:\n\nG ≅ Z_5 × Z_7\n\nThis means that the group of order 35 is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 5 and 7."
