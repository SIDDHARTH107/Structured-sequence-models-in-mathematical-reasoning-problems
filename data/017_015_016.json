    "message_2": "To prove that there exists a non-abelian group of order 24 that is not isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24 or the alternating group A5, we will construct such a group using the direct product of groups.\n\nConsider the group S3, the symmetric group on 3 elements. This group has order 6 and is non-abelian. Now consider the group C4, the cyclic group of order 4. The direct product of these two groups, S3 × C4, has order 6 × 4 = 24.\n\nWe claim that the group S3 × C4 is non-abelian and not isomorphic to C24 or A5.\n\nFirst, let's show that S3 × C4 is non-abelian. Take two elements (a, b) and (c, d) in S3 × C4, where a, c ∈ S3 and b, d ∈ C4. Since S3 is non-abelian, there exist elements a and c such that ac ≠ ca. Then, ((a, b)(c, d)) = (ac, bd) and ((c, d)(a, b)) = (ca, db). Since ac ≠ ca, we have (ac, bd) ≠ (ca, db), and thus S3 × C4 is non-abelian.\n\nNow, let's show that S3 × C4 is not isomorphic to C24. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists an isomorphism φ: S3 × C4 → C24. Since C24 is abelian, for any two elements (a, b) and (c, d) in S3 × C4, we must have φ((a, b)(c, d)) = φ((c, d)(a, b)). However, we have shown that S3 × C4 is non-abelian, so there exist elements (a, b) and (c, d) such that (a, b)(c, d) ≠ (c, d)(a, b). This contradicts the assumption that φ is an isomorphism, so S3 × C4 cannot be isomorphic to C24.\n\nFinally, let's show that S3 × C4 is not isomorphic to A5. The group A5 has order 60, so it cannot be isomorphic to a group of order 24.\n\nThus, we have shown that there exists a non-abelian group of order 24, namely S3 × C4, that is not isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24 or the alternating group A5."
