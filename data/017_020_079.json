    "message_2": "The dihedral group D20 has order 40, as it is the group of symmetries of a regular 20-sided polygon (20 rotations and 20 reflections). To form a group of order 40 that is isomorphic to D20, we need to find the number of ways to generate a group with the same structure as D20.\n\nSince D20 is generated by a rotation and a reflection, we can represent it as the group generated by two elements, r and s, with the following relations:\n\n1. r^20 = 1 (identity element)\n2. s^2 = 1 (s is a reflection)\n3. srs = r^(-1) (conjugation by s inverts the rotation)\n\nTo form a group isomorphic to D20, we need to find a pair of elements in the group that satisfy these relations. However, since D20 is a specific group with a fixed structure, there is only one way to form a group that is isomorphic to it: by choosing the elements that generate D20 itself.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 way to form a group of order 40 that is isomorphic to the dihedral group D20."
