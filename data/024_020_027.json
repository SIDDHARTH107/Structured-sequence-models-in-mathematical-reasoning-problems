    "message_2": "The Hopf map is a mapping from the 3-sphere S³ to the 2-sphere S². The 3-sphere S³ can be represented as the set of all unit quaternions, and the 2-sphere S² can be represented as the set of all points (x, y, z) satisfying the equation x² + y² + z² = 1. The Hopf map is defined as follows:\n\nGiven a unit quaternion q = a + bi + cj + dk, where a² + b² + c² + d² = 1, the Hopf map h(q) maps q to the point (x, y, z) on S², where:\n\nx = 2(bc + ad)\ny = 2(ac - bd)\nz = a² + b² - c² - d²\n\nNow, let's find the image of the point (1, 0, 0) under the Hopf map. To do this, we first need to represent this point as a unit quaternion. Since (1, 0, 0) lies on the 3-sphere S³, we can represent it as the quaternion q = 1 + 0i + 0j + 0k.\n\nNow, we can apply the Hopf map to this quaternion:\n\nx = 2(0 * 0 + 1 * 0) = 0\ny = 2(1 * 0 - 0 * 0) = 0\nz = 1² + 0² - 0² - 0² = 1\n\nSo, the image of the point (1, 0, 0) under the Hopf map is (0, 0, 1)."
