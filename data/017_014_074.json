    "message_2": "There are 5 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20. They are as follows:\n\n1. C_20: The cyclic group of order 20. This group is generated by a single element of order 20 and has the presentation <a | a^20 = 1>.\n\n2. C_4 x C_5: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 5. This group has the presentation <a, b | a^4 = b^5 = 1, ab = ba>.\n\n3. C_2 x C_2 x C_5: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 5. This group has the presentation <a, b, c | a^2 = b^2 = c^5 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb>.\n\n4. D_20: The dihedral group of order 20. This group consists of the symmetries of a regular decagon and has the presentation <a, b | a^10 = b^2 = 1, ab = ba^9>.\n\n5. F_20: The Frobenius group of order 20. This group has the presentation <a, b | a^5 = b^4 = 1, ab = ba^3>.\n\nThese are all the distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20."
