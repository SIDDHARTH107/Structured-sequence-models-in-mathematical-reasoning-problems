    "message_2": "To find the sum of all the divisors of 72, we first need to find all the divisors of 72. The divisors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\nNow, we add up all these divisors:\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 12 + 18 + 24 + 36 + 72 = 195\n\nThe sum of all the divisors of 72 is 195."
