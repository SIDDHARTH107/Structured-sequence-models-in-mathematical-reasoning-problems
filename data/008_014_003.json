    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 -1 |\n    | 2 -1  4 |\n    | 1  3  2 |\n\nb = |  7  |\n    |  4  |\n    | 12  |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a method of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R, such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (such as MATLAB, Python, or Wolfram Alpha), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.80  0.36 -0.48 |\n    | -0.53 -0.84  0.12 |\n    | -0.27  0.42  0.84 |\n\nR = | -3.74 -1.60  3.20 |\n    |  0   -3.08 -1.44 |\n    |  0    0    1.92 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^Tb, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nQ^Tb = | -9.60 |\n       | -9.84 |\n       |  9.12 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb using back substitution:\n\nR = | -3.74 -1.60  3.20 | x = | -9.60 |\n    |  0   -3.08 -1.44 |     | -9.84 |\n    |  0    0    1.92 |       |  9.12 |\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n1.92z = 9.12\nz = 9.12 / 1.92\nz ≈ 4.75\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n-3.08y - 1.44z = -9.84\n-3.08y - 1.44(4.75) ≈ -9.84\ny ≈ 1.00\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n-3.74x - 1.60y + 3.20z ≈ -9.60\n-3.74x - 1.60(1.00) + 3.20(4.75) ≈ -9.60\nx ≈ 2.00\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 2.00\ny ≈ 1.00\nz ≈ 4.75"
