If 12 students like to play both soccer and basketball, 15 students like to play both basketball and volleyball, 10 students like to play both soccer and volleyball, and 8 students like to play all three sports, how many students like only one sport?",
    "message_2": "To find out how many students like only one sport, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of students who like at least one sport: \n20 (soccer) + 25 (basketball) + 30 (volleyball) = 75\n\nNext, we subtract the number of students who like two sports:\n75 - 12 (soccer and basketball) - 15 (basketball and volleyball) - 10 (soccer and volleyball) = 38\n\nNow, we add back the number of students who like all three sports, since we subtracted them twice:\n38 + 8 (all three sports) = 46\n\nFinally, we subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many students like only one sport:\n50 (total students) - 46 (students who like at least two sports) = 4\n\nSo, 4 students like only one sport."
