    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can tell you that calculating the exact area of the largest connected component of the Mandelbrot set at a specific depth is a complex task. The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, and its boundary is infinitely complex. The area of the Mandelbrot set is known to be less than 2, but an exact value is not known.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with an approximation of the area using the Monte Carlo method. This method involves generating random points within a known bounding box of the Mandelbrot set (e.g., a rectangle with corners at -2, -2 and 2, 2) and checking if they belong to the Mandelbrot set. The ratio of points inside the set to the total number of points can be used to estimate the area.\n\nTo get a more accurate estimation, you can increase the number of random points generated and the depth of the Mandelbrot set. However, even with a depth of 1000, the estimation will still be an approximation and not an exact value."
