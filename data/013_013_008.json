    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price.\n\nIn this case, the bids are as follows:\n\nBidder A: $5000\nBidder B: $7000\nBidder C: $5500\nBidder D: $6000\n\nThe highest bid is from Bidder B at $7000, so Bidder B wins the auction. The second-highest bid is from Bidder D at $6000. Therefore, Bidder B pays $6000 for the painting."
