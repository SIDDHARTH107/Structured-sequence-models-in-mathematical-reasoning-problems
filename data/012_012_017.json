    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of graph G with 10 vertices and 16 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. First, we need to find the minimum degree (δ) of the graph. Since the graph has 10 vertices and 16 edges, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 16) / 10 = 3.2. Since the average degree is 3.2, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of at least 4 (the minimum degree δ ≥ 4).\n\n2. Now, let's consider the shortest cycle that can be formed with a vertex of degree 4. The shortest cycle that can be formed is a triangle (3-cycle), which is formed by connecting two of the neighbors of the vertex with each other.\n\n3. However, we need to check if a triangle can actually be formed in this graph. To do this, we can use the inequality relating the girth (g), the number of vertices (n), and the minimum degree (δ) of a graph:\n\nn ≥ (δ + 1) * (δ - 1) / 2\n\nIn our case, n = 10 and δ = 4, so:\n\n10 ≥ (4 + 1) * (4 - 1) / 2\n10 ≥ 5 * 3 / 2\n10 ≥ 7.5\n\nSince the inequality is not satisfied, a triangle (3-cycle) cannot be formed in the graph.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the next shortest cycle, which is a 4-cycle (a square). To form a 4-cycle, we need to connect two pairs of neighbors of the vertex with each other.\n\n5. Again, we need to check if a 4-cycle can actually be formed in this graph. We can use the same inequality as before, but with g = 4:\n\nn ≥ (δ + 2) * (δ - 2) / 2\n\nIn our case, n = 10 and δ = 4, so:\n\n10 ≥ (4 + 2) * (4 - 2) / 2\n10 ≥ 6 * 2 / 2\n10 ≥ 6\n\nSince the inequality is satisfied, a 4-cycle (a square) can be formed in the graph.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph G with 10 vertices and 16 edges is 4."
