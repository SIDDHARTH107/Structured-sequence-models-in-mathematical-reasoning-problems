    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative polynomial ring $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x,y \\rangle$, generated by noncommutative variables $x$ and $y$ over the field of complex numbers. Let $I=(x^2y-3y^3,yx^2-x^3y^2)$ be the ideal generated by two elements of the ring. Determine a Groebner basis for $I$ with respect to the lexicographic ordering $y > x$.",
    "message_2": "In the noncommutative polynomial ring $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x, y \\rangle$, we need to be careful when computing the S-polynomial and performing the division algorithm since the variables do not commute. We will use the lexicographic ordering with $y > x$.\n\nGiven the ideal $I = (x^2y - 3y^3, yx^2 - x^3y^2)$, let's start by computing the S-polynomial of the two generators:\n\n$S(x^2y - 3y^3, yx^2 - x^3y^2) = \\operatorname{lcm}(x^2y, yx^2)(x^2y - 3y^3) - \\operatorname{lcm}(x^2y, yx^2)(yx^2 - x^3y^2)$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ do not commute, we have:\n\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(x^2y, yx^2) = x^2yx^2$\n\nNow, we can compute the S-polynomial:\n\n$S = x^2yx^2(x^2y - 3y^3) - x^2yx^2(yx^2 - x^3y^2)$\n\n$S = x^4y^2x^2 - 3x^2y^3x^2 - x^2y^2x^4 + x^5y^4$\n\nNow, we perform the division algorithm with respect to the given generators:\n\n$S = x^4y^2x^2 - 3x^2y^3x^2 - x^2y^2x^4 + x^5y^4$\n\nSince the leading terms of the generators do not divide any term of S, we cannot simplify S further. Thus, the Groebner basis for the ideal $I$ is:\n\n$G = \\{x^2y - 3y^3, yx^2 - x^3y^2, x^4y^2x^2 - 3x^2y^3x^2 - x^2y^2x^4 + x^5y^4\\}$"
