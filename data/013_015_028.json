    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to perform a task. The agent's effort level affects the outcome of the task, which has a potential profit of $1000. The agent's effort level can be either high or low. The probability of success is higher if the agent exerts high effort (80%) compared to low effort (40%). The agent's cost of exerting a high effort is $300, while a low effort costs $100. If the agent exerts high effort and the task succeeds, the principal will pay the agent a $500 bonus. If the agent exerts low effort and the task fails, the principal will pay the agent nothing. If the agent exerts low effort and the task succeeds, the principal will pay the agent only the salary of $500 for completing the task.\n\nWhat effort level should the agent choose to maximize their expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effort level that the agent should choose to maximize their expected payoff, we need to calculate the expected payoff for both high effort and low effort.\n\n1. High Effort:\n- Probability of success: 80% (0.8)\n- Payoff if successful: $500 bonus + $500 salary = $1000\n- Cost of high effort: $300\n\nExpected payoff for high effort = (Probability of success * Payoff if successful) - Cost of high effort\n= (0.8 * $1000) - $300\n= $800 - $300\n= $500\n\n2. Low Effort:\n- Probability of success: 40% (0.4)\n- Payoff if successful: $500 salary\n- Cost of low effort: $100\n\nExpected payoff for low effort = (Probability of success * Payoff if successful) - Cost of low effort\n= (0.4 * $500) - $100\n= $200 - $100\n= $100\n\nComparing the expected payoffs, the agent should choose to exert high effort to maximize their expected payoff, as the expected payoff for high effort ($500) is greater than the expected payoff for low effort ($100)."
