    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and every vertex has a degree of at least 1.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 vertices, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is (10-1) = 9 edges. Since our graph has 15 edges, it is possible that the graph is connected.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In a connected graph, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is equal to the minimum vertex cut, which is the minimum number of vertices that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nIn a tree (a connected graph with no cycles), the minimum vertex cut is 1, as removing any leaf vertex will disconnect the graph. However, since our graph has 15 edges and a tree with 10 vertices would have only 9 edges, our graph must contain at least one cycle.\n\nTo find the minimum vertex cut, we can use the formula:\n\nMinimum vertex cut = (number of edges) - (number of vertices) + k\n\nwhere k is the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nSince our graph is connected, k = 1. Therefore, the minimum vertex cut is:\n\nMinimum vertex cut = 15 - 10 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 6."
