    "message_1": "A car manufacturing company wants to design a new car model with minimal costs. The company has a fixed budget of $1,000,000 for the production of the car. The company's engineering team has come up with three design options for the car, each with different cost structures.\n\nDesign option A: $50,000 per car plus $500 in research and development costs.\nDesign option B: $60,000 per car plus $200 in research and development costs.\nDesign option C: $70,000 per car plus $100 in research and development costs.\n\nAssuming that the car-selling price for each design option is $90,000, the company wants to determine which car design option should be chosen to maximize profit. What is the optimal design option for the company, and what is the maximum profit that can be earned if the company produces 10,000 cars?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the profit per car for each design option:\n\nProfit per car = Selling price - Cost per car\n\nDesign option A:\nProfit per car = $90,000 - $50,000 = $40,000\n\nDesign option B:\nProfit per car = $90,000 - $60,000 = $30,000\n\nDesign option C:\nProfit per car = $90,000 - $70,000 = $20,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the maximum number of cars that can be produced for each design option within the budget of $1,000,000:\n\nDesign option A:\n$1,000,000 = $50,000 * Number of cars + $500 * 10,000 (R&D cost)\n$1,000,000 = $50,000 * Number of cars + $5,000,000\nNumber of cars = (1,000,000 - 5,000,000) / 50,000 = -80\n\nDesign option B:\n$1,000,000 = $60,000 * Number of cars + $200 * 10,000 (R&D cost)\n$1,000,000 = $60,000 * Number of cars + $2,000,000\nNumber of cars = (1,000,000 - 2,000,000) / 60,000 = -16.67\n\nDesign option C:\n$1,000,000 = $70,000 * Number of cars + $100 * 10,000 (R&D cost)\n$1,000,000 = $70,000 * Number of cars + $1,000,000\nNumber of cars = (1,000,000 - 1,000,000) / 70,000 = 0\n\nSince the budget is not enough to produce any cars with the given cost structures, the company cannot make a profit with any of the design options. The company needs to either increase the budget or reduce the costs of the design options to produce cars and make a profit."
