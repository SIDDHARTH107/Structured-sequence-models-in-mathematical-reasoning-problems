    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order: 18 = 2 × 3^2.\n2. Determine the possible structures of the groups based on the prime factors.\n\nThere are three possibilities for the structure of a group of order 18:\n\na) A direct product of a group of order 2 and a group of order 9: C2 × C9 or C2 × (C3 × C3).\nb) A semi-direct product of a group of order 2 and a group of order 9: C2 ⋊ C9 or C2 ⋊ (C3 × C3).\nc) A group of order 18 itself: C18.\n\nNow, we analyze each possibility:\n\na) C2 × C9: This is a direct product of two cyclic groups, which results in a cyclic group of order 18, i.e., C18.\n   C2 × (C3 × C3): This is a direct product of C2 and a group of order 9. Since there is only one group of order 9 (C9), this case reduces to the previous one, C18.\n\nb) C2 ⋊ C9: This is a semi-direct product of C2 and C9. There are two possibilities for the action of C2 on C9: trivial and non-trivial. The trivial action results in the direct product C2 × C9, which we already considered. The non-trivial action results in a new non-isomorphic group, which we will call G1.\n   C2 ⋊ (C3 × C3): This is a semi-direct product of C2 and a group of order 9. Since there is only one group of order 9 (C9), this case reduces to the previous one, C2 ⋊ C9.\n\nc) C18: This is a cyclic group of order 18, which we have already considered.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 18: C18 and G1."
