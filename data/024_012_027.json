    "message_2": "Since M is a 3-dimensional manifold, a 4-form on M is necessarily zero. This is because a 4-form on M would require four linearly independent vectors in the tangent space at each point, but the tangent space at each point of M is only 3-dimensional. Therefore, the 4-form $\\alpha$ is identically zero on M.\n\nAs a result, the integral of $\\alpha$ over M is also zero:\n\n$$\\int_M \\alpha = 0$$"
