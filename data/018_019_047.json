The symmetric difference between two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 3, 5, 7}\nA ∩ B = {3, 5}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between the set {1, 2, 3, 4} and A ∆ B:\n\n({1, 2, 3, 4}) ∆ ({1, 7}) = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {1, 7}) - ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 7})\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {1, 7} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}\n{1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 7} = {1}\n\n({1, 2, 3, 4}) ∆ ({1, 7}) = {2, 3, 4, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection between set B and {2, 4, 6, 8}:\n\nB ∩ {2, 4, 6, 8} = {}\n\nNow, we will find the symmetric difference between the two sets we just found:\n\n({2, 3, 4, 7}) ∆ ({}) = ({2, 3, 4, 7} ∪ {}) - ({2, 3, 4, 7} ∩ {})\n\n{2, 3, 4, 7} ∪ {} = {2, 3, 4, 7}\n{2, 3, 4, 7} ∩ {} = {}\n\n({2, 3, 4, 7}) ∆ ({}) = {2, 3, 4, 7}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference between the set ({1, 2, 3, 4}) ∆ (A ∆ B) and (B ∩ {2, 4, 6, 8}) is {2, 3, 4, 7}."
