    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), which represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nFirst, let's distribute the 5 identical red balls into 3 distinct boxes such that no box is empty. This can be represented as S(5, 3). Using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, we find that S(5, 3) = 25.\n\nNext, let's distribute the 3 identical blue balls into the 3 distinct boxes such that no box is empty. This can be represented as S(3, 3). Using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, we find that S(3, 3) = 1.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to distribute both the red and blue balls into the 3 distinct boxes such that no box is empty, we simply multiply the two results together:\n\nTotal ways = S(5, 3) * S(3, 3) = 25 * 1 = 25.\n\nSo, there are 25 ways to distribute the 5 identical red balls and 3 identical blue balls into 3 distinct boxes such that no box is empty."
