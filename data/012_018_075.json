    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G, denoted by λ(G), is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges whose removal results in a disconnected or trivial graph.\n\nMenger's theorem states that the edge connectivity λ(G) is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any two distinct vertices in G. \n\nSince G has 8 vertices and 12 edges, we can use the following inequality to find an upper bound for the edge connectivity:\n\nλ(G) ≤ min{deg(u), deg(v)}\n\nwhere deg(u) and deg(v) are the degrees of vertices u and v in G. \n\nThe sum of the degrees of all vertices in G is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nΣ(deg(u)) = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nSince there are 8 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in G is:\n\n24 / 8 = 3\n\nThis means that there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less. Let's assume that the minimum degree of a vertex in G is 3. Then, the edge connectivity λ(G) is at most 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where λ(G) = 3. If we remove 3 edges from G, we should be able to disconnect the graph. Since the minimum degree of a vertex is 3, removing 3 edges will result in at least one vertex with a degree of 0, which means that the graph will be disconnected.\n\nTherefore, the edge connectivity of G is λ(G) = 3."
