    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n\ny' + 3y = 6,\n\nwe will use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y, which in this case is 3:\n\nIntegrating factor = e^(∫3 dx) = e^(3x).\n\nNow, we multiply the entire ODE by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(3x)(y' + 3y) = 6e^(3x).\n\nThis makes the left-hand side of the equation an exact derivative:\n\n(d/dx)[y * e^(3x)] = 6e^(3x).\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(d/dx)[y * e^(3x)] dx = ∫6e^(3x) dx.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\ny * e^(3x) = 2e^(3x) + C,\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. Now, we can solve for y:\n\ny = (2e^(3x) + C) * e^(-3x).\n\nTo find the value of C, we use the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = (2e^(3*0) + C) * e^(-3*0).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2 = 2 + C.\n\nSo, C = 0. Therefore, the solution to the ODE is:\n\ny(x) = 2e^(3x) * e^(-3x) = 2."
