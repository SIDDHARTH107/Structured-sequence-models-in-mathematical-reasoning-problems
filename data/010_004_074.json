    "message_2": "To determine whether S is a compact set in (R, T), we need to show that every open cover of S has a finite subcover. Recall that an open cover of S is a collection of open sets in T such that their union contains S.\n\nLet {U_i} be an arbitrary open cover of S. Since S is a closed interval [0, 1], it is a bounded set. We will use the Heine-Borel theorem, which states that a subset of R is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. \n\nS is closed because it contains all its limit points, and it is bounded because it is contained within the interval [0, 1]. Therefore, by the Heine-Borel theorem, S is compact.\n\nThus, every open cover of S has a finite subcover, and S is a compact set in (R, T)."
