    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (the area of the cone's side) and then add them together.\n\n1. Base area (circle): A = πr²\nA = π(6cm)²\nA = 36π cm²\n\n2. Lateral surface area: LSA = πr * l (where l is the slant height)\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) using the Pythagorean theorem: l² = r² + h²\nl² = (6cm)² + (8cm)²\nl² = 36 + 64\nl² = 100\nl = √100\nl = 10cm\n\nNow, we can find the lateral surface area:\nLSA = π(6cm)(10cm)\nLSA = 60π cm²\n\n3. Total surface area: TSA = Base area + Lateral surface area\nTSA = 36π cm² + 60π cm²\nTSA = 96π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 96π cm² or approximately 301.59 cm²."
