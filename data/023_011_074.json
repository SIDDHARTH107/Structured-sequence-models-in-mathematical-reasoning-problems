    "message_1": "A signal f(t) has periodic waveform with a fundamental frequency of 100 Hz. The Fourier transform of the signal is defined as F(w). If the signal is sampled with a sampling rate of 200 Hz, what is the frequency resolution of the Fourier transform in Hz?",
    "message_2": "The frequency resolution of the Fourier transform can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFrequency Resolution = 1 / T\n\nwhere T is the time duration of the signal.\n\nSince the signal is sampled at a rate of 200 Hz, the Nyquist frequency is 200 Hz / 2 = 100 Hz. This means that the signal can be represented up to the fundamental frequency of 100 Hz without aliasing.\n\nTo find the time duration (T) of the signal, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 1 / Fundamental Frequency\n\nT = 1 / 100 Hz = 0.01 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency resolution:\n\nFrequency Resolution = 1 / T = 1 / 0.01 seconds = 100 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency resolution of the Fourier transform is 100 Hz."
