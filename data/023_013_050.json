    "message_1": "A copper rod with a length of 20cm has a thermal conductivity of 4 W/mK. The ends of the rod are kept at temperatures of 80°C and 20°C. Using the Fourier transform, calculate the time-dependent temperature profile of the rod after 2 minutes, assuming that the initial temperature is uniform at 25°C.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with Fourier series. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material. For copper, α = k / (ρ * c_p) = 4 W/mK / (8.96 * 10^3 kg/m³ * 385 J/kgK) ≈ 1.11 * 10^(-4) m²/s.\n\nThe boundary conditions are T(0,t) = 80°C and T(L,t) = 20°C, where L = 0.2 m is the length of the rod. The initial condition is T(x,0) = 25°C.\n\nFirst, we need to find the steady-state temperature profile T_s(x) that satisfies the boundary conditions. This can be done by solving the equation:\n\nd²T_s(x) / dx² = 0\n\nThe general solution is T_s(x) = A * x + B, where A and B are constants. Applying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n80 = B\n20 = A * L + 80\n\nSolving for A and B, we find A = -300 K/m and B = 80 K. So, the steady-state temperature profile is:\n\nT_s(x) = -300x + 80\n\nNow, we need to find the transient temperature profile T_t(x,t) = T(x,t) - T_s(x). The heat equation for T_t(x,t) becomes:\n\n∂T_t(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T_t(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwith boundary conditions T_t(0,t) = T_t(L,t) = 0 and initial condition T_t(x,0) = -55 + 300x.\n\nWe can solve this equation using the method of separation of variables and Fourier series. The solution is given by:\n\nT_t(x,t) = ∑[B_n * sin(n * π * x / L) * exp(-α * (n * π / L)² * t)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2 / L) * ∫[T_t(x,0) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L.\n\nCalculating the Fourier coefficients B_n, we get:\n\nB_n = (2 / 0.2) * ∫[(-55 + 300x) * sin(n * π * x / 0.2) dx] from 0 to 0.2\n\nIntegrating and simplifying, we find:\n\nB_n = 1200 * (1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π)\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature profile after 2 minutes (120 seconds):\n\nT(x,120) = T_s(x) + T_t(x,120)\n\nT(x,120) = -300x + 80 + ∑[1200 * (1 - (-1)^n) / (n * π) * sin(n * π * x / 0.2) * exp(-1.11 * 10^(-4) * (n * π / 0.2)² * 120)]\n\nThe temperature profile T(x,120) can be approximated by taking the first few terms of the Fourier series."
