    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal structure created by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. Each level of the pyramid adds more triangles to the structure.\n\nThe total number of triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid of level n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal Triangular Faces = 4^n - 1\n\nFor a Sierpinski pyramid of level 5, we have:\n\nTotal Triangular Faces = 4^5 - 1\nTotal Triangular Faces = 1024 - 1\nTotal Triangular Faces = 1023\n\nSo, there are 1023 triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid of level 5."
