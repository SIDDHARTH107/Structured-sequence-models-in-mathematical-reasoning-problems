    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$, we need to use the Levi-Civita connection associated with the metric $g$. Since the metric is Euclidean, the connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols) are all zero. Therefore, the covariant derivative of $T$ is simply the ordinary derivative of its components.\n\nLet's compute the covariant derivative of $T$ component-wise:\n\n1. For the first component, $x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\otimes dx$:\n\n$DT(x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\otimes dx) = d(x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) \\otimes dx = (2x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) \\otimes dx$\n\n2. For the second component, $y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\otimes dx$:\n\n$DT(y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\otimes dx) = d(y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) \\otimes dx = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) \\otimes dx$\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of $T$ is:\n\n$DT = (2x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) \\otimes dx + (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) \\otimes dx$"
