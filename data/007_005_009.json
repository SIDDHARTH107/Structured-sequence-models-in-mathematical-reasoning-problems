    "message_2": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the three numbers, we can use the relationship between LCM and GCF, which is:\n\nLCM(a, b, c) * GCF(a, b, c) = a * b * c\n\nGiven the LCM(20, 36, 60) = 720, we can plug in the values and solve for the GCF:\n\n720 * GCF(20, 36, 60) = 20 * 36 * 60\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nGCF(20, 36, 60) = (20 * 36 * 60) / 720\n\nGCF(20, 36, 60) = (20 * 36 * 60) / (20 * 36)\n\nGCF(20, 36, 60) = 60\n\nSo, the greatest common factor (GCF) of 20, 36, and 60 is 60."
