    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) between x = 0 and x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2) * x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = ((3/2) * x^(1/2))^2 = (9/4) * x\n\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9/4) * x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + (9/4) * x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 1 + (9/4) * x\ndu/dx = (9/4)\ndx = (4/9) * du\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 10] √(u) * (4/9) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * ∫[1, 10] u^(1/2) du\nL = (4/9) * [(2/3) * u^(3/2)] [1, 10]\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (8/27) * (10 * √10 - 1)\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * (31.62) ≈ 9.39\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 9.39 units."
