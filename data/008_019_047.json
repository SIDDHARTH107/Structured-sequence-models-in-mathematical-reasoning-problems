    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the third equation. We will also multiply the first equation by 5 and subtract it from the second equation.\n\n(2)(3x + 2y + 7z) = (2)(8 + 2i)\n6x + 4y + 14z = 16 + 4i\n\n(5)(3x + 2y + 7z) = (5)(8 + 2i)\n15x + 10y + 35z = 40 + 10i\n\nNow, subtract the first modified equation from the third equation and the second modified equation from the second equation:\n\n2x + 6y + 4z - (6x + 4y + 14z) = -i - (16 + 4i)\n5x + (1+i)y - z - (15x + 10y + 35z) = 6 + 9i - (40 + 10i)\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n-4x + 2y - 10z = -17 - 3i\n-10x - (9-i)y + 34z = -34 - i\n\nNow, let's eliminate y from the new second equation. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -(-9+i)/2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n(-(-9+i)/2)(-4x + 2y - 10z) = (-(-9+i)/2)(-17 - 3i)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(9-i)x + (-9+i)y - (45-5i)z = 153 + 11i\n\nAdding this equation to the second equation:\n\n(-10x - (9-i)y + 34z) + ((9-i)x + (-9+i)y - (45-5i)z) = -34 - i + 153 + 11i\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-x + 29z = 119 + 10i\n\nNow, we can solve for x in terms of z:\n\nx = 29z - 119 - 10i\n\nNext, substitute this expression for x back into the first modified equation:\n\n6(29z - 119 - 10i) + 4y + 14z = 16 + 4i\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n174z - 714 - 60i + 4y + 14z = 16 + 4i\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n188z - 698 - 64i + 4y = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y in terms of z:\n\ny = (698 + 64i - 188z)/4\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for x and y back into the original first equation:\n\n3(29z - 119 - 10i) + 2((698 + 64i - 188z)/4) + 7z = 8 + 2i\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n87z - 357 - 30i + 349 + 32i - 94z + 7z = 8 + 2i\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nz = 2 + 2i\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into the expressions for x and y:\n\nx = 29(2 + 2i) - 119 - 10i\ny = (698 + 64i - 188(2 + 2i))/4\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = 58 + 58i - 119 - 10i\ny = (698 + 64i - 376 - 376i)/4\n\nx = -61 + 48i\ny = (322 - 312i)/4\n\nx = -61 + 48i\ny = 80.5 - 78i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -61 + 48i\ny = 80.5 - 78i\nz = 2 + 2i"
