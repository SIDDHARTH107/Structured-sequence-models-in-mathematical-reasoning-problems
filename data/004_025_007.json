    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car at t = 3 seconds, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time, which will give us the acceleration function. \n\nThe velocity function is v(t) = 2t^2 - 6t + 4. \n\nNow, let's find the derivative of this function with respect to time (t):\n\ndv/dt = d(2t^2 - 6t + 4)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ndv/dt = 4t - 6\n\nNow that we have the acceleration function, we can find the acceleration at t = 3 seconds by plugging in t = 3 into the acceleration function:\n\na(3) = 4(3) - 6\na(3) = 12 - 6\na(3) = 6\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at t = 3 seconds is 6 m/sÂ²."
