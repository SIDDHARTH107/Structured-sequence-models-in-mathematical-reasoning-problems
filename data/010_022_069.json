    "message_1": "Consider a smooth, oriented, closed surface S embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and a point $p$ on the surface $S$. Suppose further that the surface $S$ is equipped with a Riemannian metric, so that we can speak of the length of curves on $S$. Let $\\alpha$ be a simple, closed curve on $S$ that passes through $p$, parameterized by arc length. Prove that there exists a simple, closed curve $\\beta$ on $S$ that is homotopic to $\\alpha$, has the same length as $\\alpha$, and passes through $p$.",
    "message_2": "We will prove this by constructing the curve $\\beta$ explicitly. Let $\\alpha: [0, L] \\rightarrow S$ be the simple closed curve with length $L$ and $\\alpha(0) = \\alpha(L) = p$. Since $\\alpha$ is parameterized by arc length, we have $\\lVert \\alpha'(t) \\rVert = 1$ for all $t \\in [0, L]$.\n\nNow, consider the tangent vector field $T(t) = \\alpha'(t)$ along the curve $\\alpha$. Since $S$ is a closed surface, we can apply the Poincar√©-Hopf theorem to the vector field $T(t)$, which states that the sum of the indices of the zeros of a vector field on a closed surface is equal to the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nSince the Euler characteristic of a closed surface is nonzero, there must exist at least one point $q \\in S$ where the tangent vector field $T(t)$ has a zero, i.e., $T(t_q) = 0$ for some $t_q \\in [0, L]$. Note that $q \\neq p$ since $T(t)$ is nonzero at $p$.\n\nNow, let $\\gamma: [0, L] \\rightarrow S$ be a simple closed curve that passes through $q$ and is homotopic to $\\alpha$. We can construct $\\gamma$ by \"sliding\" $\\alpha$ along a homotopy that moves $p$ to $q$ while keeping the curve simple and closed. Since $\\gamma$ is homotopic to $\\alpha$, it has the same length as $\\alpha$.\n\nFinally, we will construct the curve $\\beta$ by \"sliding\" $\\gamma$ back to $p$ along the same homotopy in reverse. Since $\\gamma$ is simple, closed, and has the same length as $\\alpha$, the resulting curve $\\beta$ will also be simple, closed, and have the same length as $\\alpha$. Moreover, $\\beta$ is homotopic to $\\gamma$, and therefore also homotopic to $\\alpha$. Thus, we have constructed the desired curve $\\beta$ on $S$ that is homotopic to $\\alpha$, has the same length as $\\alpha$, and passes through $p$."
