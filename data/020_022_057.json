    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The factory has 500 units of raw material and 1000 units of labor available per day. Producing one unit of A requires 3 units of raw material and 2 units of labor, while producing one unit of B requires 2 units of raw material and 4 units of labor. The profit per unit of A is $5, and the profit per unit of B is $7. How many units of A and B should the factory produce to maximize profit? What is the maximum profit that the factory can make in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for raw material and labor can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 500 (raw material constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 1000 (labor constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the inequalities. The labor constraint can be simplified to x + 2y ≤ 500. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 250), (166.67, 166.67), and (250, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 250) = 5(0) + 7(250) = $1750\n3. P(166.67, 166.67) = 5(166.67) + 7(166.67) ≈ $1999.99\n4. P(250, 0) = 5(250) + 7(0) = $1250\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 166.67 units of A and 166.67 units of B. However, since the factory can only produce whole units, we need to check the profit for producing 166 units of A and 167 units of B, and 167 units of A and 166 units of B:\n\nP(166, 167) = 5(166) + 7(167) = $1997\nP(167, 166) = 5(167) + 7(166) = $1998\n\nThe factory should produce 167 units of A and 166 units of B to maximize profit. The maximum profit that the factory can make in a day is $1998."
