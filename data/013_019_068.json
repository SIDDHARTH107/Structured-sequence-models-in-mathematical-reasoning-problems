    "message_1": "A politician is running for office and trying to communicate a message to voters through cheap talk. The politician can either make an honest statement about their policy goals or make a dishonest statement to try to appeal to more voters. The voters will make their decisions based on the politician's statements. If the policy goals of the politician and the voters align, the voters will be better off voting for the politician. However, if the politician is dishonest, voters will be worse off if they vote for them. Consider a scenario where the politician can receive 40% of the vote if they tell the truth and 60% of the vote if they lie. However, if the politician lies, the voters who vote for them will be worse off by 5 points. What strategy should the politician choose to maximize their vote share?",
    "message_2": "The politician's goal is to maximize their vote share. In this scenario, they have two options: tell the truth and receive 40% of the vote, or lie and receive 60% of the vote. The negative impact on voters who vote for the politician when they lie is not directly relevant to the politician's vote share.\n\nTherefore, to maximize their vote share, the politician should choose the strategy that results in the highest percentage of votes, which is to lie and receive 60% of the vote."
