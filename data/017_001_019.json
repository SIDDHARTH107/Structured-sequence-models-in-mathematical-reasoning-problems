Determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.",
    "message_2": "To prove that either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 or G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4, we will consider two cases: when G has an element of order 4 and when G does not have an element of order 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4\nLet a be an element in G with order 4. Then, the powers of a form a cyclic subgroup of G: {e, a, a^2, a^3}. Since this subgroup has the same order as G, it must be equal to G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 4, and G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 4\nSince G has order 4 and does not have an element of order 4, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements of G. Then, the subgroup generated by a is {e, a}, and the subgroup generated by b is {e, b}. Since a and b are distinct, their product ab must be another non-identity element of G. Moreover, (ab)^2 = a^2 * b^2 = e * e = e, so ab also has order 2. Now, G has four elements: e, a, b, and ab. Since all non-identity elements have order 2, G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nNow, let's consider the numerical problem:\n\nLet G be a group of order 4 such that its non-identity elements have orders 2 and 4. Determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nSince G has an element of order 4, by the argument in Case 1, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C4."
