    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula, which is used to model the number of events (in this case, car collisions) in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe Poisson distribution formula is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^x)) / x!\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x events (collisions) occurring in the given interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (collisions) in the given interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- x! is the factorial of x (the product of all positive integers up to x)\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of car collisions in a year. We are given that there are 10 cars passing through the road each hour, and the probability of a single car collision is 0.005.\n\nThe total number of cars passing through the road in a year is:\n\n10 cars/hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year = 87,600 cars/year\n\nNow, we can find the average number of car collisions in a year:\n\nλ = 87,600 cars/year * 0.005 = 438 collisions/year\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least two cars colliding in a year. To do this, we can find the probability of 0 collisions and 1 collision, and then subtract those probabilities from 1.\n\nP(0 collisions) = (e^(-438) * (438^0)) / 0! = e^(-438)\nP(1 collision) = (e^(-438) * (438^1)) / 1! = 438 * e^(-438)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least two cars colliding in a year:\n\nP(at least 2 collisions) = 1 - P(0 collisions) - P(1 collision)\nP(at least 2 collisions) = 1 - e^(-438) - (438 * e^(-438))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(at least 2 collisions) ≈ 1 - 5.92 * 10^(-191) - 2.59 * 10^(-188) ≈ 1\n\nThe probability of at least two cars colliding on the particular road in a year is approximately 1, or 100%. This result suggests that it is almost certain that at least two cars will collide on the road in a year, given the provided information."
