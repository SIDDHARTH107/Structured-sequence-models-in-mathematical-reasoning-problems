    "message_1": "Let X be a Calabi-Yau variety and let f and g be regular functions on X such that the divisor of g does not contain any irreducible components of the divisor of f. If f and g vanish on a smooth hypersurface H in X, then show that their product fg vanishes to order at least 2 on H.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the divisors of f and g by D(f) and D(g), respectively. Since the divisor of g does not contain any irreducible components of the divisor of f, we can say that D(f) and D(g) have no common irreducible components. \n\nNow, let's consider the smooth hypersurface H in X where both f and g vanish. This means that H is contained in both D(f) and D(g). Since H is irreducible, it must be an irreducible component of both D(f) and D(g). However, we know that D(f) and D(g) have no common irreducible components, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that f and g both vanish on H must be incorrect.\n\nNow, let's consider the product fg. Since f and g are regular functions on X, their product fg is also a regular function on X. Let's denote the divisor of fg by D(fg). By the properties of divisors, we have:\n\nD(fg) = D(f) + D(g)\n\nSince H is contained in both D(f) and D(g), it must also be contained in D(fg). Let's denote the multiplicity of H in D(f), D(g), and D(fg) by m_f, m_g, and m_fg, respectively. Then, we have:\n\nm_fg = m_f + m_g\n\nSince f and g both vanish on H, we know that m_f and m_g are both at least 1. Therefore, their sum m_fg must be at least 2. This means that the product fg vanishes to order at least 2 on H."
