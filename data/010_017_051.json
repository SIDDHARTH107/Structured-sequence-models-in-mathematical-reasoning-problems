    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + 3x_2^2$. This function represents an elliptical paraboloid in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with its minimum at the origin $(0,0)$. The level sets of this function are ellipses centered at the origin.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of $d$ such that the compact sublevel set $K =\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid f(x) \\leq d\\}$ has $H_1(K) = \\mathbb{Z}$. In other words, we want to find the maximum value of $d$ such that the sublevel set $K$ has a non-trivial first homology group, which means that $K$ has a hole in it.\n\nSince the level sets of $f$ are ellipses centered at the origin, the sublevel set $K$ will be an ellipse centered at the origin as well. The only way for $K$ to have a hole in it is if the ellipse degenerates into a single point, which happens when $d = 0$. In this case, $K$ consists of just the origin, and $H_1(K) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $d$ such that the compact sublevel set $K$ has $H_1(K) = \\mathbb{Z}$ is $d = 0$."
