    "message_2": "To calculate the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference = Diameter × π\n\nThe diameter of the trampoline is 10 feet, and the value of π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nCircumference = 10 × 3.14159 ≈ 31.4159 feet\n\nSo, the circumference of the circular trampoline is approximately 31.42 feet."
