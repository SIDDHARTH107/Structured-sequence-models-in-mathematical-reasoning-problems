Let's choose k = 6 for this example.\n2. Compute A = α^k mod p. In this case, A = 5^6 mod 23.\n3. Compute B = M * (β^k) mod p. In this case, B = 8 * (19^6) mod 23.\n\nNow, let's compute A and B:\n\nA = 5^6 mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 10\n\nB = 8 * (19^6) mod 23\nB = 8 * (47045881) mod 23\nB = 376366648 mod 23\nB = 18\n\nSo, the ciphertext (A, B) is (10, 18)."
