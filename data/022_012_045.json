    "message_2": "The given meromorphic function is:\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z^5}{(z+1)^2(z-2)}$$\n\nTo find the poles, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator becomes zero. The poles are the zeros of the denominator:\n\n1. $(z+1)^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow z = -1$. This is a pole of order 2.\n2. $(z-2) = 0 \\Rightarrow z = 2$. This is a pole of order 1.\n\nSo, there are 2 poles: $z = -1$ with order 2 and $z = 2$ with order 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the residues at these poles.\n\n1. Residue at $z = -1$ (pole of order 2):\n\nWe can use the formula for the residue of a pole of order 2:\n$$\\text{Res}(f, -1) = \\lim_{z \\to -1} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[(z+1)^2 f(z)\\right]$$\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f, -1) = \\lim_{z \\to -1} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[\\frac{z^5}{(z-2)}\\right]$$\n\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$\\text{Res}(f, -1) = \\lim_{z \\to -1} \\frac{5z^4(z-2) - z^5}{(z-2)^2}$$\n\nNow, substitute $z = -1$:\n$$\\text{Res}(f, -1) = \\frac{5(-1)^4(-3) - (-1)^5}{(-3)^2} = \\frac{-8}{9}$$\n\n2. Residue at $z = 2$ (pole of order 1):\n\nWe can use the formula for the residue of a pole of order 1:\n$$\\text{Res}(f, 2) = \\lim_{z \\to 2} (z-2) f(z)$$\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f, 2) = \\lim_{z \\to 2} \\frac{z^5}{(z+1)^2}$$\n\nNow, substitute $z = 2$:\n$$\\text{Res}(f, 2) = \\frac{2^5}{(2+1)^2} = \\frac{32}{9}$$\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(z)$ has 2 poles: $z = -1$ with residue $-\\frac{8}{9}$ and $z = 2$ with residue $\\frac{32}{9}$."
