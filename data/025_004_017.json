    "message_2": "Let's first write down the parametrization of the curve $C$:\n\n$$x(t) = t^2 - t$$\n$$y(t) = t^3 - t^2$$\n\nWe want to find a rational function $f(x, y)$ such that $f(x(t), y(t)) = 0$ for all $t$. To do this, let's first eliminate the parameter $t$ from the equations above.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can write $t$ in terms of $x$:\n\n$$t = x + 1$$\n\nNow substitute this expression for $t$ into the second equation:\n\n$$y(t) = (x + 1)^3 - (x + 1)^2 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 - (x^2 + 2x + 1) = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$$\n\nNow we can define the rational function $f(x, y)$ as:\n\n$$f(x, y) = y - x^3 - 2x^2 - x$$\n\nNow let's check that $C$ is the zero set of $f$. For any point $(x(t), y(t))$ on the curve $C$, we have:\n\n$$f(x(t), y(t)) = y(t) - x(t)^3 - 2x(t)^2 - x(t) = (t^3 - t^2) - (t^2 - t)^3 - 2(t^2 - t)^2 - (t^2 - t)$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$$f(x(t), y(t)) = t^3 - t^2 - t^6 + 3t^5 - 3t^4 + t^3 - 2t^4 + 4t^3 - 2t^2 - t^2 + t = 0$$\n\nSo, indeed, $C$ is the zero set of $f(x, y) = y - x^3 - 2x^2 - x$."
