    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible total distance, we can use the traveling salesman problem approach. We will find the shortest path that visits each location exactly once and returns to the starting location.\n\nWe can start by finding the shortest path from each location to any other location:\n\n1. From A: A -> E (5), A -> C (6), A -> D (7)\n2. From B: B -> E (3), B -> D (3), B -> C (5)\n3. From C: C -> F (2), C -> B (5), C -> A (6)\n4. From D: D -> B (3), D -> F (4), D -> E (5)\n5. From E: E -> F (2), E -> B (3), E -> D (5)\n6. From F: F -> C (2), F -> E (2), F -> D (4)\n\nNow, we can try to find the shortest path that visits each location exactly once:\n\n1. A -> E (5) -> F (2) -> C (2) -> B (5) -> D (3) -> A (7) = 24\n2. A -> C (6) -> F (2) -> E (2) -> B (3) -> D (3) -> A (7) = 23\n3. A -> D (7) -> B (3) -> E (3) -> F (2) -> C (2) -> A (6) = 23\n\nThe shortest possible total distance the delivery person can travel to visit all six locations is 23 units."
