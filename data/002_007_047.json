    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8cm and the lengths of its parallel sides are 6cm and 10cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 6cm and 10cm, and the height is 8cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (6 + 10) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (16) * 8\nArea = 8 * 8\nArea = 64 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 64 square centimeters."
