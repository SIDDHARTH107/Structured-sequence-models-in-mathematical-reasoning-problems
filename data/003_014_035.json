    "message_2": "The period of a trigonometric function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. For a sine function of the form y = A sin(Bx), the period can be found using the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nIn this case, y = 2 sin(3x), so A = 2 and B = 3. To find the period, we can plug B into the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |3|\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the period of the function y = 2 sin(3x) is (2π) / 3."
