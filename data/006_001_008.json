    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly three tails in five coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, tails) in n trials (coin flips)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes out of n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting tails) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting heads) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips), which is 5 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (tails) we want, which is 3 in this case\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (5C3) * (0.5^3) * (0.5^(5-3))\n\nFirst, let's calculate 5C3:\n\n5C3 = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n     = 5! / (3!2!)\n     = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)(2*1))\n     = (5*4) / (2*1)\n     = 10\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.5^3) = 0.125\n(0.5^2) = 0.25\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.03125\nP(X = 3) = 0.3125\n\nSo the probability of getting exactly three tails in five coin flips is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
