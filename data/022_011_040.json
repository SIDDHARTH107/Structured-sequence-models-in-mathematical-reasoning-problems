    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to solve the equation f(z) = 0:\n\n$z^4 + 2z^3 + 2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quartic polynomial equation, and it doesn't have an easy factorization. We can use numerical methods or specialized software to find the approximate zeros. Using a numerical solver, we find the following zeros:\n\n1. $z_1 \\approx -1.28438$\n2. $z_2 \\approx -0.707106 - 1.22474i$\n3. $z_3 \\approx -0.707106 + 1.22474i$\n4. $z_4 \\approx 0.698593$\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function. Poles are points where the function goes to infinity. Since f(z) is a polynomial, it is an entire function, meaning it is holomorphic (analytic) everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, it has no poles. Polynomials only have zeros, and their behavior at infinity is determined by the highest-degree term.\n\nSo, the zeros of the function are approximately $z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4$, and there are no poles."
