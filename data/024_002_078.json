    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface S, we need to solve the geodesic equations for the given surface. The geodesic equations are derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations applied to the arc length functional. \n\nFirst, let's find the metric tensor g_ij for the surface S. The parametrization of the surface S can be given as:\n\nΦ(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form:\n\nΦ_u = (∂Φ/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nΦ_v = (∂Φ/∂v) = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nThe metric tensor g_ij is given by the dot products of these vectors:\n\ng_11 = Φ_u • Φ_u = 1 + 4u^2\ng_12 = g_21 = Φ_u • Φ_v = -4uv\ng_22 = Φ_v • Φ_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we can write the Lagrangian L for the arc length functional:\n\nL = √(g_11 (du/dt)^2 + 2g_12 (du/dt)(dv/dt) + g_22 (dv/dt)^2)\n\nThe geodesic equations are given by the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n\nd/dt (∂L/∂(du/dt)) - ∂L/∂u = 0\nd/dt (∂L/∂(dv/dt)) - ∂L/∂v = 0\n\nSolving these equations is quite involved and requires advanced techniques in differential geometry. However, we can make some observations about the given points P(2, 1, 3) and Q(-2, -1, 3).\n\nNotice that the surface S is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and y-axis. Since P and Q are symmetric with respect to the origin, the geodesic connecting them must also be symmetric. Therefore, the geodesic must pass through the origin (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow, consider the straight line connecting P, the origin, and Q:\n\nL(t) = (1-t)P + tQ = (2-4t, 1-2t, 3)\n\nFor this line, we have:\n\nz = x^2 - y^2 = (2-4t)^2 - (1-2t)^2 = 3\n\nThis equation holds for all t, which means that the straight line L(t) lies entirely on the surface S. Since the straight line is the shortest path between two points, it must be the geodesic connecting P and Q.\n\nTherefore, the geodesic connecting P(2, 1, 3) and Q(-2, -1, 3) on the surface S is given by the straight line:\n\nL(t) = (2-4t, 1-2t, 3) for t in [0, 1]."
