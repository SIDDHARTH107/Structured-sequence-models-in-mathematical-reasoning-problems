    "message_2": "To find the first derivative of the function f(x) = sin(2x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's denote the inner function as g(x) = 2x. Then, the outer function is h(g(x)) = sin(g(x)).\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the inner function g(x) = 2x:\n\ng'(x) = 2\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the outer function h(g(x)) = sin(g(x)):\n\nh'(g(x)) = cos(g(x))\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = h'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nf'(x) = cos(g(x)) * 2\n\nSince g(x) = 2x, we substitute it back into the equation:\n\nf'(x) = cos(2x) * 2\n\nSo, the first derivative of the function f(x) = sin(2x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 2cos(2x)"
