    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose a farmer has 2000 acres of land on which to grow two crops: wheat and corn. The farmer has a total of 4000 pounds of fertilizer available, and the labor and machinery needed to cultivate one acre of wheat is three times greater than that needed for one acre of corn. Each acre of wheat yields a profit of $600, while each acre of corn yields a profit of $400. How many acres of each crop should the farmer plant to maximize profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of corn. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. Total land constraint: x + y ≤ 2000\n2. Fertilizer constraint: 3x + y ≤ 4000 (since the labor and machinery needed for wheat is three times that of corn)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 600x + 400y.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 2000 => y ≤ 2000 - x\n2. 3x + y ≤ 4000 => y ≤ 4000 - 3x\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 2000), (1000, 1000), and (1333.33, 0). We will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 600(0) + 400(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 2000) = 600(0) + 400(2000) = $800,000\n3. P(1000, 1000) = 600(1000) + 400(1000) = $1,000,000\n4. P(1333.33, 0) = 600(1333.33) + 400(0) = $800,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the farmer plants 1000 acres of wheat and 1000 acres of corn, yielding a profit of $1,000,000."
