    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nWe are given the base (12 cm) and the two adjacent angles (30 degrees and 60 degrees). We can use trigonometry to find the height of the triangle.\n\nLet's call the height \"h\" and the side opposite the 60-degree angle \"a\". Since we have a 30-60-90 triangle, we can use the properties of this special triangle to find the height.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest side (1), the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the middle side (√3), and the hypotenuse is the longest side (2).\n\nWe know that the base of the triangle (the side opposite the 30-degree angle) is 12 cm. So, we can set up a proportion to find the side opposite the 60-degree angle (a):\n\n1/2 = 12/a\n\nSolving for a, we get:\n\na = 24 cm\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height (h):\n\nh^2 + 12^2 = 24^2\nh^2 + 144 = 576\nh^2 = 432\nh = √432 ≈ 20.78 cm\n\nNow that we have the height, we can find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 12 cm * 20.78 cm\nArea ≈ 124.68 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 124.68 cm²."
