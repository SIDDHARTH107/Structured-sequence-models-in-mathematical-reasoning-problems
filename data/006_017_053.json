    "message_2": "We can model this situation using the Poisson distribution, which is used to calculate the probability of a given number of events (in this case, car accidents involving pedestrians) occurring in a fixed interval (a day) given the average rate of occurrence (0.05 accidents per day).\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (car accidents involving pedestrians), k is the desired number of events (in this case, at least 1 accident), λ is the average rate of occurrence (0.05 accidents per day), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nTo find the probability of at least 1 car accident involving a pedestrian, we can first find the probability of no accidents (k = 0) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.05) * 0.05^0) / 0! = e^(-0.05) * 1 / 1 = e^(-0.05)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 1 accident:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-0.05)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 0.95123 ≈ 0.04877\n\nSo, the probability of a car accident involving a pedestrian on a particular road in a given day is approximately 0.04877 or 4.88%."
