    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 1, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nNow, let's square both sides of the given equation:\n\n(sin(x) + cos(x))^2 = 1^2\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nsin^2(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nNow, replace sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) with 1 using the trigonometric identity:\n\n1 + 2sin(x)cos(x) = 1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: sin(x) = 0\nx = nπ, where n is an integer\n\nHowever, we are looking for solutions between 0 and 2π. So, the possible values for x are:\n\nx = 0, π\n\nCase 2: cos(x) = 0\nx = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer\n\nAgain, we are looking for solutions between 0 and 2π. So, the possible values for x are:\n\nx = π/2, 3π/2\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 1, where x is between 0 and 2π, are:\n\nx = 0, π, π/2, 3π/2"
