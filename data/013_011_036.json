    "message_1": "In a Bertrand competition, two firms are competing to sell a particular good. The market demand for the good is represented by Q = 100 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. Both firms have identical costs of production, which is $20 per unit. What price should each firm set in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete on price, and the firm with the lowest price captures the entire market demand. If both firms set the same price, they will split the market demand equally. Since both firms have identical costs of production ($20 per unit), they will try to undercut each other's prices to capture the market.\n\nLet's denote the price set by firm 1 as P1 and the price set by firm 2 as P2. The profit for each firm can be calculated as:\n\nProfit1 = (P1 - 20) * Q1\nProfit2 = (P2 - 20) * Q2\n\nWhere Q1 and Q2 are the quantities sold by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively.\n\nIn a Bertrand competition, the firm with the lowest price captures the entire market demand. Therefore, if P1 < P2, then Q1 = Q and Q2 = 0. If P1 = P2, then Q1 = Q2 = Q/2. If P1 > P2, then Q1 = 0 and Q2 = Q.\n\nSince both firms are trying to maximize their profits, they will try to set their prices as close as possible to their costs without going below them. If one firm sets a price below its cost, it will make a loss, and the other firm can set a price slightly above its cost to capture the entire market and make a profit.\n\nIn this case, the optimal price for both firms to set is equal to their cost of production, which is $20 per unit. If both firms set their prices at $20, they will split the market demand equally and make zero economic profit. Any attempt to undercut the other firm's price will result in a loss, so both firms will maintain their prices at $20.\n\nSo, the price each firm should set to maximize its profit is $20."
