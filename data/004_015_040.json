    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function, we first need to find its second derivative. \n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = 3x² - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x for which f''(x) = 0:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 2. To determine whether this inflection point is a local maximum or a local minimum, we can analyze the sign of the second derivative around this point.\n\nFor x < 2, f''(x) is negative, which means the function is concave down.\nFor x > 2, f''(x) is positive, which means the function is concave up.\n\nSince the concavity changes from down to up at x = 2, the inflection point at x = 2 is a local minimum."
