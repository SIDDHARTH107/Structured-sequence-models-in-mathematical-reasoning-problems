    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first represent the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 8 |\n    | 7 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant(A) = (3 * -5) - (2 * 4) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/Determinant(A)) * adjugate(A)\n\nThe adjugate of A is found by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadjugate(A) = | -5 -2 |\n                     | -4  3 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-23) * | -5 -2 |\n                          | -4  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/23  2/23 |\n             | 4/23 -3/23 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | 5/23  2/23 | * | 8 |\n        | 4/23 -3/23 |   | 7 |\n\nX = | (5/23 * 8) + (2/23 * 7) |\n        | (4/23 * 8) - (3/23 * 7) |\n\nX = | 40/23 + 14/23 |\n        | 32/23 - 21/23 |\n\nX = | 54/23 |\n        | 11/23 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 54/23\ny = 11/23"
