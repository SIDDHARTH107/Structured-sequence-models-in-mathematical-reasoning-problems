Determine the Hopf map of $S^3$ onto the complex projective plane $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ given by $H(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = [\\alpha, \\beta]$, where $\\alpha = x_1 + ix_2$ and $\\beta = x_3 + ix_4$ are complex numbers satisfying $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$.",
    "message_2": "The Hopf map is a mapping from the 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ to the complex projective plane $\\mathbb{C}P^1$, not $\\mathbb{C}P^2$. The complex projective plane $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ is also known as the Riemann sphere. The Hopf map is given by:\n\n$H(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = [\\alpha, \\beta]$\n\nwhere $\\alpha = x_1 + ix_2$ and $\\beta = x_3 + ix_4$ are complex numbers satisfying $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$. Since $S^3$ is defined by the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = 1$, we can see that the condition $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$ is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's compute the Hopf map explicitly. Given a point $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \\in S^3$, we have:\n\n$\\alpha = x_1 + ix_2$\n$\\beta = x_3 + ix_4$\n\nThe complex projective plane $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ is the set of equivalence classes of non-zero complex numbers, where two complex numbers are considered equivalent if they differ by a non-zero scalar multiple. Thus, we can represent a point in $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ as the equivalence class $[\\alpha, \\beta]$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are non-zero complex numbers.\n\nThe Hopf map $H$ is then given by:\n\n$H(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = [x_1 + ix_2, x_3 + ix_4]$\n\nThis map takes a point on the 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ and maps it to a point on the complex projective plane $\\mathbb{C}P^1$."
