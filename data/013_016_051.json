Employee A has a base salary of $40,000 and a bonus of 10% of the profit they generate for the company. Employee B has a base salary of $50,000 and a bonus of 8% of the profit they generate for the company. \n\nAssume that the company generates $1,000,000 in profit. If Employee A generates $200,000 in profit and Employee B generates $300,000 in profit, who will receive a higher total compensation (base salary plus bonus)?",
    "message_2": "To determine who will receive a higher total compensation, we need to calculate the total compensation for both Employee A and Employee B.\n\nEmployee A:\nBase salary: $40,000\nBonus: 10% of $200,000 profit = 0.10 * $200,000 = $20,000\nTotal compensation for Employee A: $40,000 + $20,000 = $60,000\n\nEmployee B:\nBase salary: $50,000\nBonus: 8% of $300,000 profit = 0.08 * $300,000 = $24,000\nTotal compensation for Employee B: $50,000 + $24,000 = $74,000\n\nEmployee B will receive a higher total compensation of $74,000 compared to Employee A's total compensation of $60,000."
