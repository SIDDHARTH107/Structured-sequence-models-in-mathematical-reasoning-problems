    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is a fractal that increases the length of a line segment by a factor of 4/3 with each iteration.\n\nAfter the 5th iteration, the length of the Koch curve is:\n\nLength = Original length × (4/3)^iterations\nLength = 20 × (4/3)^5\nLength ≈ 20 × 2.48832\nLength ≈ 49.7664 cm\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle with each side being a Koch curve, the total length of the Koch island is:\n\nTotal length = 3 × Length of one Koch curve\nTotal length = 3 × 49.7664 cm\nTotal length ≈ 149.2992 cm\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch island after the 5th iteration is approximately 149.2992 cm."
