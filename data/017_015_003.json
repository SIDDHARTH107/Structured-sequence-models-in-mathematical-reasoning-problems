    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 24, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 24. Then, |G| = 2^3 * 3. We will first find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. Let P_3 be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible cases for n_2 and n_3:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the second Sylow theorem, both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G. Since |P_2| = 8 and |P_3| = 3, and their intersection is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, i.e., G ≅ Z_8 × Z_3. Note that Z_8 has two possible isomorphism classes: Z_8 and Z_2 × Z_4. Thus, we have two possible isomorphism classes in this case: Z_8 × Z_3 and Z_2 × Z_4 × Z_3.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P_3 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 8: Z_8 and Z_2 × Z_4. The automorphism group of Z_3 is Z_2, so we have two possible semidirect products for each group of order 8. However, one of the semidirect products for each group of order 8 is a direct product, which we have already considered in Case 1. Thus, we have two new isomorphism classes in this case: Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 and (Z_2 × Z_4) ⋊ Z_3.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P_3 and P_2. However, the automorphism group of Z_8 is Z_2 × Z_4, which has no elements of order 3. Thus, there are no new isomorphism classes in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Neither P_2 nor P_3 are normal in G, so we cannot form a semidirect product. However, we can consider the action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to S_3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups, which has order 2. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 2, say N. Then, G/N has order 12, and there are two possible isomorphism classes for groups of order 12: Z_12 and A_4. Since G has no elements of order 12, G cannot be isomorphic to Z_12. Thus, G must be isomorphic to A_4.\n\nIn summary, there are five possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 24:\n\n1. Z_8 × Z_3\n2. Z_2 × Z_4 × Z_3\n3. Z_8 ⋊ Z_3\n4. (Z_2 × Z_4) ⋊ Z_3\n5. A_4\n\nWe have shown that every group of order 24 must fall into one of these isomorphism classes."
