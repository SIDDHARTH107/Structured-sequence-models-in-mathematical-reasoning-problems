    "message_1": "What is the probability of winning a game that has a total of 52 cards and the player must choose a single card from the deck, where the winning card is the Ace of Spades?",
    "message_2": "There is only 1 Ace of Spades in a standard deck of 52 cards. To find the probability of winning the game by choosing the Ace of Spades, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, there is only 1 favorable outcome (choosing the Ace of Spades) and there are 52 possible outcomes (choosing any of the 52 cards).\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game is:\n\nProbability = 1 / 52 â‰ˆ 0.01923 or 1.923%\n\nThe probability of winning the game by choosing the Ace of Spades is approximately 1.923%."
