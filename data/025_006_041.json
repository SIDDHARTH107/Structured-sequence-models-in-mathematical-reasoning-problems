    "message_2": "To determine the order of the torsion subgroup of H^1(X,ℤ), we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology. The theorem states that for any topological space X and any abelian group G, there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H_{i-1}(X,ℤ), G) → H^i(X, G) → Hom(H_i(X,ℤ), G) → 0\n\nIn our case, we are interested in H^1(X,ℤ), so we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H_0(X,ℤ), ℤ) → H^1(X, ℤ) → Hom(H_1(X,ℤ), ℤ) → 0\n\nSince H_0(X,ℤ) is a free abelian group, Ext(H_0(X,ℤ), ℤ) = 0. Therefore, we have an isomorphism:\n\nH^1(X, ℤ) ≅ Hom(H_1(X,ℤ), ℤ)\n\nNow, we need to determine the torsion subgroup of H^1(X,ℤ). Since H^1(X, ℤ) is isomorphic to Hom(H_1(X,ℤ), ℤ), the torsion subgroup of H^1(X,ℤ) is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of Hom(H_1(X,ℤ), ℤ).\n\nHowever, without more information about the algebraic variety X or its homology groups, we cannot determine the order of the torsion subgroup of H^1(X,ℤ). The given information about H^2(X,ℤ) being isomorphic to ℤ/5ℤ does not provide enough information to determine the torsion subgroup of H^1(X,ℤ)."
