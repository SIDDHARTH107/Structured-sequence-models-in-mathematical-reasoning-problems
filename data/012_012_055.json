    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the graph, we will use the Handshaking Lemma and the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have 8 vertices and 10 edges, so the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum degree of a vertex in the graph. If the minimum degree is 1, then there must be at least one vertex with degree 1, which means it is connected to only one other vertex. In this case, there cannot be a cycle involving this vertex, so the girth would be greater than 3. However, we want to find the shortest cycle, so we can rule out this case.\n\nIf the minimum degree is 2, then every vertex is connected to at least two other vertices. In this case, the graph can have a cycle of length 3. Let's see if this is possible using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nIf there is a cycle of length 3, then there must be at least one vertex with degree at least 3. If all vertices have degree 2, then the sum of the degrees of all vertices would be 2 * 8 = 16, which is less than 20. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with degree at least 3.\n\nNow, let's consider a vertex with degree 3. It is connected to three other vertices. If any of these three vertices are connected to each other, then we have a cycle of length 3. If none of these three vertices are connected to each other, then they must be connected to other vertices in the graph. Since there are only 4 other vertices, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these three vertices must be connected to the same vertex, creating a cycle of length 3.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph is 3."
