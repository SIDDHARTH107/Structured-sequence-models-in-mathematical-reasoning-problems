    "message_1": "Suppose a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil, causing a small change in the atmospheric conditions. This change results in a tornado occurring in the United States two weeks later. If the initial condition of the butterfly's wings is altered by 0.001%, how much would the tornado's location and intensity change in miles per hour? Assume that the tornado's strength is directly proportional to its speed.",
    "message_2": "This problem is based on the concept of the butterfly effect, which is a part of chaos theory. The butterfly effect suggests that small changes in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in outcomes. However, it is not possible to provide a specific numerical answer to this problem, as the relationship between the butterfly's wing flap and the tornado's location and intensity is highly complex and nonlinear.\n\nIn reality, the atmosphere is influenced by countless factors, and it is impossible to isolate the effect of a single butterfly's wing flap on the formation of a tornado. Additionally, the butterfly effect is a metaphorical concept, not a quantifiable one. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer to how much the tornado's location and intensity would change based on a 0.001% alteration in the initial condition of the butterfly's wings."
