Here's a precise numerical problem for a student to solve:\n\nConsider the function $f(z) = ze^{2z}$, where $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, and let $C$ be the unit circle centered at the origin traversed anticlockwise. Find the value of the integral\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-i}\\,dz.$$",
    "message_2": "To solve this integral, we can use the Cauchy integral formula. The Cauchy integral formula states that for a function $f(z)$ that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour $C$, and for a point $a$ inside $C$, we have:\n\n$$f(a) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-a}\\,dz$$\n\nIn our case, $f(z) = ze^{2z}$ and $a = i$. We want to find the value of the integral:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-i}\\,dz$$\n\nFirst, we need to check if $f(z)$ is analytic inside and on the contour $C$. Since $f(z) = ze^{2z}$ is a product of two analytic functions ($z$ and $e^{2z}$), it is also analytic everywhere in the complex plane, including inside and on the contour $C$.\n\nNow, we can apply the Cauchy integral formula:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-i}\\,dz = 2\\pi i f(i)$$\n\nWe need to find $f(i)$:\n\n$$f(i) = i e^{2i}$$\n\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{ix} = \\cos x + i\\sin x$, we have:\n\n$$e^{2i} = \\cos(2) + i\\sin(2)$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$f(i) = i(\\cos(2) + i\\sin(2)) = -\\sin(2) + i\\cos(2)$$\n\nNow, we can find the value of the integral:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-i}\\,dz = 2\\pi i f(i) = 2\\pi i(-\\sin(2) + i\\cos(2)) = -4\\pi\\cos(2) - 2\\pi i\\sin(2)$$\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-i}\\,dz = -4\\pi\\cos(2) - 2\\pi i\\sin(2)$$"
