    "message_2": "Based on the given information, the probability of the football team winning a game can be estimated by calculating the ratio of games won to the total number of games played.\n\nThe team has won 5 games out of their last 10 games. So, the probability of winning a game can be calculated as:\n\nProbability of winning = (Number of games won) / (Total number of games played)\nProbability of winning = 5 / 10\n\nThe probability of the football team winning a game is 0.5 or 50%. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified estimation based on past performance and does not take into account factors such as the strength of the opposing team, injuries, or other variables that could affect the outcome of a game."
