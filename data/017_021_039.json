Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the partition formula for each prime factor:\n\nFor the prime factor 2^4, there are five partitions: (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), and (1,1,1,1).\nFor the prime factor 3^1, there is only one partition: (1).\n\n3. Determine the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups by taking the product of the number of partitions for each prime factor:\n\n5 partitions for 2^4 * 1 partition for 3^1 = 5 non-isomorphic abelian groups\n\n4. Determine the number of non-abelian groups using the formula for the number of groups of order p^aq^b:\n\nFor groups of order 2^4 * 3^1, there are 4 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups.\n\n5. Add the number of abelian and non-abelian groups to find the total number of non-isomorphic groups:\n\n5 abelian groups + 4 non-abelian groups = 9 non-isomorphic groups\n\nSo, there are 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
