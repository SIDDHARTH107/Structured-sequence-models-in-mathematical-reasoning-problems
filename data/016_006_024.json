    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern algorithm is an iterative process that generates points on a 2D plane to create the image of a fern. It uses four affine transformations with different probabilities to generate the next point based on the current point. The algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Choose an initial point (x, y) on the plane, usually (0, 0).\n2. Generate a random number r between 0 and 1.\n3. Choose one of the four transformations based on the probability associated with each transformation.\n4. Apply the chosen transformation to the current point (x, y) to get the next point (x', y').\n5. Plot the new point (x', y') on the plane.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the desired number of points.\n\nTo generate an image with 1,000,000 points, you would need to iterate the Barnsley fern algorithm 1,000,000 times. This is because each iteration generates one point, and you need 1,000,000 points for the desired image. Note that the initial point (0, 0) is not counted as one of the 1,000,000 points."
