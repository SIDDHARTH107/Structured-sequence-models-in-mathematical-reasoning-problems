The cost of producing x units of a certain product is given by the function:\n\nC(x) = 1000x^2 - 240,000x + 12,000,000\n\nAssuming that the company can sell all the produced units, what is the maximum number of units that can be produced without exceeding the budget? Use the gradient descent method to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of units that can be produced without exceeding the budget, we need to minimize the cost function C(x) subject to the constraint that C(x) <= 1,000,000. \n\nFirst, let's find the gradient (derivative) of the cost function with respect to x:\n\nC'(x) = d(C(x))/dx = 2000x - 240,000\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the minimum of the cost function. We will start with an initial guess for x, say x0 = 0, and update it iteratively using the following formula:\n\nx_new = x_old - alpha * C'(x_old)\n\nwhere alpha is the learning rate, which determines the step size in the gradient descent method. We will use a learning rate of 0.01 and iterate until the change in x is very small (less than a tolerance value, say 1e-6).\n\nLet's perform the gradient descent:\n\nx_old = 0\ntolerance = 1e-6\nalpha = 0.01\n\nwhile True:\n    x_new = x_old - alpha * (2000 * x_old - 240000)\n    if abs(x_new - x_old) < tolerance:\n        break\n    x_old = x_new\n\nNow we have the value of x that minimizes the cost function. However, we need to ensure that the cost at this x value does not exceed the budget of $1,000,000. Let's check the cost:\n\nC_min = 1000 * x_new**2 - 240000 * x_new + 12000000\n\nif C_min <= 1000000:\n    max_units = x_new\nelse:\n    # If the minimum cost exceeds the budget, we need to find the x value where C(x) = 1000000\n    # We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x: ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n    a = 1000\n    b = -240000\n    c = 12000000 - 1000000\n\n    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n    x1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    x2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n    # Choose the x value that results in the minimum cost\n    max_units = min(x1, x2)\n\nThe maximum number of units that can be produced without exceeding the budget is approximately equal to max_units."
