    "message_2": "Cauchy's integral formula states that for a holomorphic function f(z) inside a simple closed contour C, the integral of f(z) along C is zero. However, this formula is applicable when f(z) is analytic inside and on the contour C.\n\nLet's check if f(z) = z^2 + 2iz - 3 is analytic. To do this, we need to check if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. First, let's rewrite f(z) in terms of its real and imaginary parts:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 3) + 2iz = (x^2 - y^2 - 3) + i(2xy + 2y)\n\nNow, let u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 3 and v(x, y) = 2xy + 2y be the real and imaginary parts of f(z), respectively. We need to check if the following Cauchy-Riemann equations hold:\n\n1. ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n2. ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x\n∂u/∂y = -2y\n∂v/∂x = 2y\n∂v/∂y = 2x\n\nNow, let's check if the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold:\n\n1. ∂u/∂x = 2x = ∂v/∂y\n2. ∂u/∂y = -2y = -∂v/∂x\n\nBoth equations hold, so f(z) is analytic inside and on the contour C. Therefore, by Cauchy's integral formula, the integral of f(z) along the closed contour C is zero."
