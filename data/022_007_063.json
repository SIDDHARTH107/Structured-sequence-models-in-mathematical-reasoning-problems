    "message_2": "Liouville's theorem states that if a polynomial has all its roots inside a circle of radius R centered at the origin, then the maximum number of roots is equal to the degree of the polynomial.\n\nIn this case, the polynomial has a degree of 5, and all its roots lie inside a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin. Therefore, according to Liouville's theorem, the maximum number of roots of the polynomial is 5."
