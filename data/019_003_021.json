    "message_1": "Let's consider a box containing 20 balls, where 6 of them are red, 8 are blue, and 6 are green. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red or blue ball from the box?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a red or blue ball, we first need to find the total number of red and blue balls, which is 6 (red) + 8 (blue) = 14. There are 20 balls in total, so the probability of selecting a red or blue ball is the number of red and blue balls divided by the total number of balls:\n\nProbability = (Number of red and blue balls) / (Total number of balls) = 14/20\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\nProbability = 14/20 = (14/2) / (20/2) = 7/10\n\nSo the probability of randomly selecting a red or blue ball from the box is 7/10, or 0.7, or 70%."
