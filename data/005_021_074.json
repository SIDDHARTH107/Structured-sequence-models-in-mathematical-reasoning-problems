    "message_1": "Suppose you want to estimate the average height of all students in your school. You take a random sample of 50 students and measure their heights. The sample mean height is 165 cm and the sample standard deviation is 7 cm. Use bootstrap sampling to estimate the standard error of the sample mean height.",
    "message_2": "Bootstrap sampling is a method used to estimate the standard error of a statistic, such as the sample mean, by repeatedly resampling from the original sample. In this case, we will use bootstrap sampling to estimate the standard error of the sample mean height of the 50 students.\n\nHere's the procedure for bootstrap sampling:\n\n1. Draw a random sample of size 50 (the same size as the original sample) with replacement from the original sample.\n2. Calculate the mean height of this new sample.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (e.g., 1000 or more) to generate a distribution of sample means.\n4. Calculate the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means. This is the estimated standard error of the sample mean height.\n\nSince we don't have the original sample data, we can't perform the bootstrap sampling directly. However, we can estimate the standard error using the sample standard deviation and the sample size.\n\nThe formula for estimating the standard error of the sample mean is:\n\nStandard Error (SE) = Sample Standard Deviation (s) / sqrt(Sample Size (n))\n\nIn this case, the sample standard deviation (s) is 7 cm, and the sample size (n) is 50.\n\nSE = 7 / sqrt(50)\nSE ≈ 7 / 7.07\nSE ≈ 0.99 cm\n\nSo, the estimated standard error of the sample mean height using bootstrap sampling is approximately 0.99 cm."
