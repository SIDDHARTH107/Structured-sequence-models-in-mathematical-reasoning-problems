    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and y be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * y = 500\n\nWe want to minimize the surface area, which is given by:\n\nS = x^2 + 4xy\n\nFirst, we can solve the volume equation for y:\n\ny = 500 / x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the surface area equation:\n\nS = x^2 + 4x(500 / x^2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nS = x^2 + 2000 / x\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of S with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndS/dx = 2x - 2000 / x^2\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x - 2000 / x^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n0 = 2x^3 - 2000\n\nNow, add 2000 to both sides and divide by 2:\n\nx^3 = 1000\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 10\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = 500 / x^2\n\ny = 500 / (10^2)\n\ny = 500 / 100\n\ny = 5\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that would minimize the surface area are 10 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm."
