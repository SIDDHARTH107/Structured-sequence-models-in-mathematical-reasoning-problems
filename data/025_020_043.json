    "message_2": "To find the number of points with coordinates in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ on the Calabi-Yau variety defined by the equation $y^3 + x^3z + z^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we will count the number of solutions $(x, y, z)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n\nRecall that in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we consider points up to a scalar multiple, so we can assume that $z = 1$ or $z = 0$. \n\nCase 1: $z = 1$\n\nThe equation becomes $y^3 + x^3 + 1 = 0$. We will count the number of solutions $(x, y)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n\nThere are 5 choices for $x$ and 5 choices for $y$, giving a total of 25 possible pairs. However, we must subtract the number of pairs $(x, y)$ that do not satisfy the equation.\n\nFor each $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_5$, there is a unique $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_5$ such that $y^3 + x^3 + 1 = 0$. To see this, note that the map $y \\mapsto y^3$ is a bijection in $\\mathbb{F}_5$. Therefore, there are 5 solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: $z = 0$\n\nThe equation becomes $y^3 = 0$, which has only one solution: $y = 0$. However, we must also consider the value of $x$. Since we are in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we cannot have both $x$ and $y$ equal to 0. Therefore, there are 4 solutions in this case (corresponding to the 4 non-zero values of $x$).\n\nIn total, there are $5 + 4 = 9$ points with coordinates in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ on the Calabi-Yau variety."
