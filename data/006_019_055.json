    "message_1": "A political survey estimates that 60% of registered voters in a certain country support the incumbent president. If a random sample of 200 voters is taken, what is the probability that at least 120 voters support the incumbent president?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 0.60)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 200)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 120)\n\nHowever, since we want to find the probability of at least 120 voters supporting the incumbent president, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 120, 121, ..., 200. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nP(X ≥ 120) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 120 to 200\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be quite tedious, so we can use a complementary probability approach. We can find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., fewer than 120 voters supporting the incumbent president) and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 120) = 1 - P(X < 120) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 119\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 119:\n\nΣ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 119 = Σ [C(200, k) * (0.60)^k * (0.40)^(200-k)] for k = 0 to 119\n\nThis calculation can be done using statistical software or a calculator with a built-in binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF). Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X < 120) ≈ 0.0716\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 120 voters supporting the incumbent president:\n\nP(X ≥ 120) = 1 - P(X < 120) = 1 - 0.0716 ≈ 0.9284\n\nSo, the probability that at least 120 voters support the incumbent president in a random sample of 200 voters is approximately 0.9284 or 92.84%."
