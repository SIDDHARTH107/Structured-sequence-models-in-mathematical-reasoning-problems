    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method, we first write down the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  4 ]\n[ 2  4 -2 |  8 ]\n[ 4  8 -4 | 16 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix into row-echelon form. We start by subtracting 2 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  4 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0 ]\n```\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. We can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the system of equations is dependent. Since the coefficient matrix is singular, there is no unique solution to this system of equations. The system has infinitely many solutions, and we can express the solution set in terms of a free variable.\n\nLet's express the solution set in terms of z:\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\nx + 2y - z = 4\n\nNow, let z = t, where t is a free variable. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx + 2y = 4 + t\n\nWe can solve for x and y in terms of t:\n\nx = 4 + t - 2y\n\nNow, we can express the solution set as:\n\nx = 4 + t - 2y\ny = y\nz = t\n\nThis is the general solution to the given system of linear equations."
