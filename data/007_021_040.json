Here's a Python implementation of the algorithm to find the smallest factor of 93081:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    return gcd(b, a % b)\n\ndef f(x, n):\n    return (x * x + 1) % n\n\ndef pollards_rho(n):\n    x = 2\n    y = 2\n    d = 1\n\n    while d == 1:\n        x = f(x, n)\n        y = f(f(y, n), n)\n        d = gcd(abs(x - y), n)\n\n    return d\n\nn = 93081\nsmallest_factor = pollards_rho(n)\nprint(smallest_factor)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we find that the smallest factor of 93081 is 13."
