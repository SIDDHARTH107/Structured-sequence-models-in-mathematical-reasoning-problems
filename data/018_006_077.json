    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', is: A' = {4, 5}, since these are the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the union of A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. In this case, the union of A and A' is:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nWe can see that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U\n\nThus, we have verified that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
