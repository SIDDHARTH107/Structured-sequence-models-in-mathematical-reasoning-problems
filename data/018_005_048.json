    "message_2": "The complement of a set X, denoted as X', contains all the elements that are not in X. Since X contains the elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, its complement X' contains all the elements that are not in X. \n\nHowever, the intersection of a set and its complement is the set of elements that are both in X and not in X, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the intersection of X and its complement is the empty set, denoted as âˆ…."
