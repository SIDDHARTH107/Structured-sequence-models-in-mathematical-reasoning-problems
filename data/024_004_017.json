    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u · r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u · r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v · r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nE = 5\nF = 2\nG = 5\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu · N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = r_uv · N = 0\nN = r_vv · N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nL = 2 / sqrt(9) = 2 / 3\nM = 0\nN = 2 / 3\n\nFinally, we can compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/2) * ( (E * N + G * L - 2 * F * M) / (E * G - F^2) )\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nH = (1/2) * ( (5 * (2/3) + 5 * (2/3) - 2 * 2 * 0) / (5 * 5 - 2^2) )\nH = (1/2) * ( (20/3) / 21 )\nH = 10/21\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) is 10/21."
