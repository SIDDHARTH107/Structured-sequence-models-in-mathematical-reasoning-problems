    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size m (a complete subgraph with m vertices) or an independent set of size n (a set of n vertices with no edges between them).\n\nFor R(4,4), it is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size 4 or an independent set of size 4.\n\nThe exact value of R(4,4) is 18. This means that in any graph with 18 vertices, there must be either a complete subgraph with 4 vertices or an independent set of 4 vertices."
