    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have:\n\na^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 5 and p = 7. So, according to Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n5^(7-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 5^37 is divided by 7. We can rewrite 5^37 as:\n\n5^37 = (5^6)^(6) * 5^1\n\nSince we know that 5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n(5^6)^6 * 5^1 ≡ 1^6 * 5^1 (mod 7)\n1^6 * 5^1 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the remainder when 5^37 is divided by 7 is 5."
