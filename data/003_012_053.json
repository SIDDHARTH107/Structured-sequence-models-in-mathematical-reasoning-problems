    "message_2": "To find the height of the hot air balloon from the ground, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the height (opposite side) and the distance (adjacent side) in a right triangle.\n\nLet's denote the height of the hot air balloon as h and the distance between the person and the point directly below the balloon as d. In this case, d = 100 meters, and the angle of elevation is 45째.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(45째) = h / d\n\nSince tan(45째) = 1, the equation becomes:\n\n1 = h / 100\n\nTo find the height h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100:\n\nh = 100 * 1\n\nh = 100 meters\n\nSo, the height of the hot air balloon from the ground is 100 meters."
