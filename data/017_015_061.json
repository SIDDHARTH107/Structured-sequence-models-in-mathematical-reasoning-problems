    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to one of the given groups, we will analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow Theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 24, which has prime factorization 2^3 * 3. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 8 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G since they are unique. The order of P is 8 and the order of Q is 3. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C_8 x C_3 = C_24. So G can be isomorphic to C24.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. The Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal. We can use the semidirect product to analyze the possible structures of G. Since there are two automorphisms of Q, there are two non-isomorphic semidirect products, which correspond to two non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is similar to Case 2, but with the roles of the Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup reversed. There are three automorphisms of the Sylow 2-subgroup, so there are three non-isomorphic semidirect products, which correspond to three non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal in G. This case does not lead to any new groups that we have not already considered.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to C24 or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24. However, G cannot be isomorphic to A5, since A5 has order 60, not 24."
