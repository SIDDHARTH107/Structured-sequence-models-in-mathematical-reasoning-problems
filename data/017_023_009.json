    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 72, and let H be a normal subgroup of G such that H is isomorphic to C_3. Since H is normal in G, we can consider the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 72/3 = 24.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorems, there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup P of G/H of order 8. Let Q be the preimage of P under the canonical projection π: G → G/H. Then, Q is a subgroup of G of order 24, and H is a normal subgroup of Q.\n\nNow, let K be a subgroup of Q such that Q = HK. Since H is normal in Q, K is a subgroup of Q of order 8. By Sylow's Theorems, K is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C_8, C_4 × C_2, or D_4 (the dihedral group of order 8).\n\nWe claim that K is not isomorphic to C_8. Suppose, for contradiction, that K is isomorphic to C_8. Then, the commutator subgroup [K, K] is a cyclic group of order 4. Since H is normal in G, the commutator subgroup [Q, Q] = [H, K] is a subgroup of H. However, this is a contradiction because H is a cyclic group of order 3, and there is no subgroup of order 4 in H. Therefore, K cannot be isomorphic to C_8.\n\nNow, we claim that K is not isomorphic to D_4. Suppose, for contradiction, that K is isomorphic to D_4. Then, the commutator subgroup [K, K] is a cyclic group of order 2. Again, since H is normal in G, the commutator subgroup [Q, Q] = [H, K] is a subgroup of H. However, this is a contradiction because H is a cyclic group of order 3, and there is no subgroup of order 2 in H. Therefore, K cannot be isomorphic to D_4.\n\nThus, K must be isomorphic to C_4 × C_2. Since H is isomorphic to C_3 and Q = HK, we have Q is isomorphic to H × K, which is isomorphic to C_3 × C_4 × C_2.\n\nNow, we have the following short exact sequence:\n\n1 → Q → G → G/Q → 1\n\nSince Q is isomorphic to C_3 × C_4 × C_2 and |G/Q| = |G|/|Q| = 72/24 = 3, G/Q is isomorphic to C_3. Therefore, G is an extension of Q by G/Q, and we have G is isomorphic to Q × G/Q, which is isomorphic to C_3 × C_4 × C_2 × C_3.\n\nFinally, we note that C_4 × C_2 is isomorphic to A_4, the alternating group of degree 4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to A_4 × C_3 × C_2."
