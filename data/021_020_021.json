    "message_1": "A company produces two products: product A and product B. The production of each product requires the use of two machines: machine 1 and machine 2. The time required to produce one unit of product A on machine 1 is 1 hour, on machine 2 is 2 hours, and for B on 1 is 3 hours and on 2 is 2 hours. Product A sells for $10 per unit and product B sells for $15 per unit. The company has 240 hours of machine 1 and 180 hours of machine 2 available per week. How many units of each product should the company produce per week to maximize their profit using the artificial bee colony algorithm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we first need to set up the problem as an optimization problem. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1x + 3y ≤ 240 (Machine 1 time constraint)\n2x + 2y ≤ 180 (Machine 2 time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can apply the artificial bee colony algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the feasible region.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution (the higher the profit, the better the fitness).\n3. Perform the employed bee phase: for each solution, generate a new solution by modifying the current solution and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the old one.\n4. Perform the onlooker bee phase: select solutions based on their fitness (roulette wheel selection) and generate new solutions as in the employed bee phase.\n5. Perform the scout bee phase: if a solution has not improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new random solution.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution for x and y, which represent the number of units of product A and product B, respectively, that the company should produce per week to maximize their profit.\n\nNote: The artificial bee colony algorithm is a heuristic optimization algorithm, and the solution may not be the exact optimal solution. However, it usually provides a good approximation to the optimal solution."
