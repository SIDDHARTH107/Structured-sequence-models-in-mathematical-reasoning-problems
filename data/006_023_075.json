    "message_1": "A company has conducted market research and determined that the probability of a customer purchasing their product is 0.6. If they approach 100 potential customers, what is the probability that at least 50 of them will make a purchase?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (purchases) in n trials (customers), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.6), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (0.4).\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 50 customers will make a purchase, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 50 to k = 100.\n\nP(X ≥ 50) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 50 to 100\n\nCalculating each term in the sum can be computationally intensive, so we can use a cumulative binomial probability table or a statistical software package to find the probability.\n\nUsing a statistical software package, we find that:\n\nP(X ≥ 50) ≈ 0.996\n\nSo, the probability that at least 50 customers will make a purchase is approximately 0.996 or 99.6%."
