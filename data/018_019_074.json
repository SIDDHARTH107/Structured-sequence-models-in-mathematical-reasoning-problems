    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and B, which is denoted as (A △ B) △ B. \n\n(A △ B) △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ B is {1, 2, 3, 4}."
