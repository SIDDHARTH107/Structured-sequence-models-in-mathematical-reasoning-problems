    "message_2": "To find all solutions of the equation 2sin(x) - 1 = 0 in the interval [-π, π], we first isolate sin(x):\n\n2sin(x) - 1 = 0\n2sin(x) = 1\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\nNow we need to find all angles x in the interval [-π, π] such that sin(x) = 1/2. We know that sin(x) = 1/2 when x = π/6 and x = 5π/6, as these are the angles in the first and second quadrants where the sine function has a value of 1/2. \n\nHowever, since we are considering the interval [-π, π], we also need to consider the angles in the third and fourth quadrants that have a sine value of 1/2. These angles are -5π/6 and -π/6, as they are the reflections of π/6 and 5π/6 across the x-axis.\n\nSo, the solutions of the equation 2sin(x) - 1 = 0 in the interval [-π, π] are:\n\nx = -5π/6, -π/6, π/6, and 5π/6."
