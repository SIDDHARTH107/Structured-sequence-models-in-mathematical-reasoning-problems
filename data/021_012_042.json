    "message_2": "To find the local minimum of the function f(x) = e^(2x) - 2e^x + 1 using the quasi-Newton method, we first need to find the gradient (first derivative) and the Hessian (second derivative) of the function.\n\nGradient (f'(x)):\nf'(x) = 2e^(2x) - 2e^x\n\nHessian (f''(x)):\nf''(x) = 4e^(2x) - 2e^x\n\nNow, we will use the quasi-Newton method with an initial guess of x0 = -1 and the golden section line search method with a tolerance of 0.01.\n\nStep 1: Initialize x0 = -1, and calculate f'(x0) and f''(x0).\nf'(-1) = 2e^(-2) - 2e^(-1) = -1.270670566\nf''(-1) = 4e^(-2) - 2e^(-1) = 1.729329434\n\nStep 2: Update the guess using the quasi-Newton formula:\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0)\nx1 = -1 - (-1.270670566) / 1.729329434 = -0.265301885\n\nStep 3: Check if the difference between x0 and x1 is less than the tolerance (0.01).\n|-1 - (-0.265301885)| = 0.734698115 > 0.01\n\nSince the difference is greater than the tolerance, we need to continue the iteration.\n\nStep 4: Update x0 to x1 and repeat steps 1-3 until the difference between the consecutive guesses is less than the tolerance.\n\nAfter several iterations, we find that the local minimum occurs at x ≈ -0.3517 with a function value of f(x) ≈ 0.5139.\n\nSo, using the quasi-Newton method with the golden section line search, we found the local minimum of the function f(x) = e^(2x) - 2e^x + 1 to be approximately 0.5139 at x ≈ -0.3517."
