    "message_1": "A student stands 20 meters away from a building and measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building as 30 degrees. What is the height of the building to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The formula is:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this problem, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the opposite side is the height of the building (which we want to find), and the adjacent side is the distance from the student to the building, which is 20 meters.\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(30) = height / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the formula:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(30)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of the angle and calculate the height:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(30) â‰ˆ 20 * 0.577 = 11.54\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 12 meters."
