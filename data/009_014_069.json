    "message_2": "The logistic growth model equation is given by:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere:\nP(t) is the population at time t\nK is the carrying capacity (10,000 in this case)\nP0 is the initial population (500 in this case)\nr is the growth rate (0.20 or 20% per hour in this case)\nt is the time in hours\ne is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nSo, the logistic growth model equation for this population is:\n\nP(t) = 10000 / (1 + (10000 - 500) / 500 * e^(-0.20*t))"
