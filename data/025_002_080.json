    "message_2": "To determine the degree of the curves X and Y, we will use the intersection theory in algebraic geometry. Let d_X and d_Y be the degrees of X and Y, respectively. The intersection number of X and Y in CP^3 is given by the product of their degrees, i.e., d_X * d_Y.\n\nSince the intersection of X and Y consists of exactly 5 points, we have:\n\nd_X * d_Y = 5\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible values of d_X and d_Y. Since 5 is a prime number, there are only two possibilities:\n\n1. d_X = 1 and d_Y = 5\n2. d_X = 5 and d_Y = 1\n\nHowever, since X is a curve and Y is a surface, the degree of X must be greater than 1. Therefore, the only possible solution is:\n\nd_X = 5 and d_Y = 1\n\nSo, the degree of the curve X is 5, and the degree of the surface Y is 1."
