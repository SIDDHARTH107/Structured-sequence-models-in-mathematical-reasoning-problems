    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 96 = 2^5 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 2^5 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFrom these conditions, we have that n_2 can be 1 or 3, and n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, both of which are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Then G is the internal direct product of P and Q, so G is isomorphic to P × Q. Since P has order 2^5 and Q has order 3, G is isomorphic to C32 × C3, which is a cyclic group of order 96. Thus, G is isomorphic to C96 in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. Let P be any Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then the order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 2^5 * 3 = 96, so G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P and Q. Since Q is normal in G, we have that G is isomorphic to P ⋊ Q. There are two possible actions of Q on P (trivial and non-trivial), so there are two possible groups in this case. Neither of these groups is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2, and both are non-abelian.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. Let Q be any Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then the order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 2^5 * 3 = 96, so G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P and Q. Since P is normal in G, we have that G is isomorphic to P ⋊ Q. There is only one possible action of Q on P (trivial), so there is only one possible group in this case. This group is not isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 and is non-abelian.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has no normal Sylow subgroups. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2, which has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. Moreover, any group in this case must be non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, but it cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2. G can also be isomorphic to any of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96, depending on the number of Sylow subgroups and the actions of these subgroups on each other."
