    "message_2": "1. Trivial topology:\n\nIn the trivial topology, the only open sets are the empty set and the whole set X. Since there are no proper non-empty open sets, there cannot be a separation of X into disjoint non-empty open sets. Therefore, X is connected in the trivial topology.\n\nHowever, X is not path-connected in the trivial topology. A path between two points x and y in X is a continuous function f: [0, 1] -> X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. In the trivial topology, the only continuous functions are constant functions, which means that there is no path between distinct points x and y in X. So, X is not path-connected in the trivial topology.\n\n2. Discrete topology:\n\nIn the discrete topology, every subset of X is open. This means that every singleton set {x} is open for each x in X. We can separate X into disjoint non-empty open sets by taking any two distinct points x and y in X and considering the open sets {x} and X - {x}. Since X can be separated into disjoint non-empty open sets, X is not connected in the discrete topology.\n\nHowever, X is path-connected in the discrete topology. Given any two points x and y in X, we can define a path f: [0, 1] -> X such that f(t) = x for t in [0, 1/2) and f(t) = y for t in [1/2, 1]. Since every subset of X is open in the discrete topology, this function is continuous, and thus X is path-connected in the discrete topology.\n\n3. Topology {(1,2,3), (3,4,5)} U {{1,4}, {2,5}}:\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the topology more clearly: T = {∅, X, {1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}, {1, 4}, {2, 5}}.\n\nTo check if X is connected, we need to see if there is a separation of X into disjoint non-empty open sets. Notice that {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are both open sets in T, and their intersection is {3}, which is non-empty. Therefore, X cannot be separated into disjoint non-empty open sets, and X is connected in this topology.\n\nTo check if X is path-connected, we need to find a continuous path between any two points in X. Let's consider the points 1 and 4. A continuous path f: [0, 1] -> X with f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 4 would require the preimage of {1, 4} to be open in the subspace topology on [0, 1]. However, the only open sets in the subspace topology on [0, 1] are ∅, {0}, {1}, and [0, 1]. There is no continuous function f with f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 4, so X is not path-connected in this topology."
