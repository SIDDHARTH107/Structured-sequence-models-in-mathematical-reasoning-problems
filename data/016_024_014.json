    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from the original square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the middle square is removed.\n\nIn the first iteration, 1/9 of the area is removed, leaving 8/9 of the area.\nIn the second iteration, each of the 8 remaining squares loses 1/9 of its area, so the total area left is (8/9) * (8/9) = 64/81.\nIn the third iteration, each of the 64 remaining squares loses 1/9 of its area, so the total area left is (64/81) * (8/9) = 512/729.\n\nSo, the ratio of the area of the 3rd iteration of the Sierpinski carpet to the area of the original square is 512/729."
