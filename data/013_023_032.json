    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A starts with 20 points and decides how many points to send to Player B, who then receives three times the number of points sent. If Player B decides to send some of the points back to Player A, they each receive what was sent back. If Player B keeps all the points, Player A gets nothing in return. If Player A decides to send 10 points, and Player B decides to keep all the points, how many total points will Player A and Player B have at the end of the game?",
    "message_2": "If Player A sends 10 points to Player B, Player A will have 20 - 10 = 10 points left. Player B will receive 3 times the number of points sent, so Player B will receive 3 * 10 = 30 points. Since Player B decides to keep all the points, Player A gets nothing in return. Therefore, at the end of the game, Player A will have 10 points and Player B will have 30 points."
