    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 2  3 -1 |  5 |\n| 1 -1  1 |  2 |\n| 3  2  1 |  1 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner.\n\n| 1 -1  1 |  2 |\n| 2  3 -1 |  5 |\n| 3  2  1 |  1 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column of Row 2 and Row 3 by subtracting multiples of Row 1.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\n| 1 -1  1 |  2 |\n| 0  5 -3 |  1 |\n| 0  5 -2 | -5 |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 5 to get a 1 in the second row and second column.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 / 5\n\n| 1 -1  1 |  2 |\n| 0  1 -3/5 |  1/5 |\n| 0  5 -2 | -5 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 5 in the second column of Row 3 by subtracting 5 times Row 2.\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 5 * Row 2\n\n| 1 -1  1 |  2 |\n| 0  1 -3/5 |  1/5 |\n| 0  0  1 | -6 |\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\nz = -6\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\ny - (3/5)z = 1/5\ny - (3/5)(-6) = 1/5\ny + 18/5 = 1/5\ny = 1/5 - 18/5\ny = -17/5\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\nx - y + z = 2\nx - (-17/5) - 6 = 2\nx + 17/5 - 30/5 = 2\nx = 2 - 17/5 + 30/5\nx = 13/5\n\nSo, the solution set is (x, y, z) = (13/5, -17/5, -6)."
