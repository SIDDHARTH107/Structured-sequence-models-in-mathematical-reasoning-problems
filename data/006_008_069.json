    "message_1": "What is the probability of getting at least 2 days of rain in a week, given that there is a 30% chance of rain each day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability, which means we will find the probability of the opposite event (not getting at least 2 days of rain) and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe opposite event is getting 0 or 1 day of rain in a week. Let's calculate the probabilities for these two cases:\n\n1. Probability of 0 days of rain:\nSince there is a 30% chance of rain each day, there is a 70% chance of no rain each day (100% - 30% = 70%). For 0 days of rain in a week, all 7 days must have no rain. So, the probability is (0.7)^7 ≈ 0.0823543.\n\n2. Probability of 1 day of rain:\nThere are 7 different ways to have 1 day of rain in a week (rain on Monday, Tuesday, ..., or Sunday). The probability of rain on any single day is 0.3, and the probability of no rain on the other 6 days is (0.7)^6 ≈ 0.117649. So, the probability of having 1 day of rain is 7 * 0.3 * 0.117649 ≈ 0.246093.\n\nNow, we can find the complement probability:\nP(at least 2 days of rain) = 1 - P(0 days of rain) - P(1 day of rain) ≈ 1 - 0.0823543 - 0.246093 ≈ 0.6715527.\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 2 days of rain in a week is approximately 67.16%."
