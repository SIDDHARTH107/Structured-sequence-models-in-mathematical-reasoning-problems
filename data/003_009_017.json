    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the perpendicular (height) as \"a\" and the base as \"b\". In this case, b = 4 cm. The hypotenuse is denoted as \"c\", and c = 10 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the perpendicular:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe know the values of b and c, so we can plug them into the equation:\n\na^2 + 4^2 = 10^2\n\na^2 + 16 = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for a^2:\n\na^2 = 100 - 16\na^2 = 84\n\nFinally, we find the length of the perpendicular by taking the square root of a^2:\n\na = √84\na ≈ 9.165 cm\n\nSo, the length of the perpendicular (height) is approximately 9.165 cm."
