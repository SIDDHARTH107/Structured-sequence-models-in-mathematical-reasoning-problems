    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx + d(2x)/dx - d(5)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 2 * x^(2-1) + 2 * 1 * x^(1-1) - 0\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 6(4) + 2\nf'(4) = 24 + 2\nf'(4) = 26\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 at x = 4 is 26."
