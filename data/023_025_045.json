    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 10 cm is heated from one end at a fixed temperature of 100°C. Using Fourier transform, calculate the temperature distribution along the rod if the thermal conductivity of the metal is 50 W/mK and it takes 5 seconds for the heat to reach the other end of the rod.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material, which is given by:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c_p)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity (50 W/mK), ρ is the density of the material, and c_p is the specific heat capacity of the material. However, we don't have the values for ρ and c_p, so we cannot find the exact temperature distribution. Instead, we will assume that the temperature distribution follows the general solution of the heat equation, which is given by:\n\nT(x,t) = A * e^(-α * k^2 * t) * sin(k * x) + T_0\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the temperature oscillation, k is the wave number, and T_0 is the initial temperature of the rod. Since the rod is heated from one end at a fixed temperature of 100°C, we can assume that T_0 = 100°C.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of A and k that satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem. The boundary conditions are:\n\n1. T(0,t) = 100°C for all t (the temperature at the heated end is always 100°C)\n2. T(10 cm, t) = 0°C for t = 5 seconds (the heat reaches the other end of the rod in 5 seconds)\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, we get:\n\n100 = A * e^(-α * k^2 * 0) * sin(0) + 100\nA * sin(0) = 0\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, this equation is satisfied for any value of A.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition, we get:\n\n0 = A * e^(-α * k^2 * 5) * sin(k * 10 cm) + 100\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find A:\n\nA = -100 / (e^(-α * k^2 * 5) * sin(k * 10 cm))\n\nNow, we have the temperature distribution along the rod:\n\nT(x,t) = (-100 / (e^(-α * k^2 * 5) * sin(k * 10 cm))) * e^(-α * k^2 * t) * sin(k * x) + 100\n\nHowever, without the values of ρ and c_p, we cannot find the exact temperature distribution. If you can provide the density and specific heat capacity of the metal, we can find the exact temperature distribution along the rod."
