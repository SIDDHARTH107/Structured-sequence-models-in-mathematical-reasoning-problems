    "message_2": "The order of a group is the number of its elements. In this case, we are looking for non-isomorphic groups of order 25. Since 25 is a prime power (5^2), we can use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = (n + p - 1) / p\n\nIn this case, p = 5 and n = 2, so the formula becomes:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = (2 + 5 - 1) / 5 = 6 / 5\n\nSince the number of non-isomorphic groups must be an integer, we can round down to the nearest integer:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = 1\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 non-isomorphic group of order 25."
