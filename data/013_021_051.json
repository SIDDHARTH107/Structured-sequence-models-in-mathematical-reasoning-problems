    "message_1": "In a centipede game, there are two players, A and B. Player A gets an initial amount of $100 and player B gets an initial amount of $50. Each player has the option to either pass or take the money at each round. If both players pass, the game continues to the next round and the amounts are increased by $10 for player A and $5 for player B. If a player chooses to take the money, the game ends and that player claims the full initial amount for themselves. If player B takes the money at any round, then player A gets nothing.\n\nAssuming player A takes the money on the 10th round, how much money does player B end up with?",
    "message_2": "If player A takes the money on the 10th round, it means both players have passed for 9 rounds. In each of these rounds, player B's amount has increased by $5. So, after 9 rounds, player B's amount has increased by 9 * $5 = $45. \n\nPlayer B's initial amount was $50, so after 9 rounds, player B has $50 + $45 = $95. \n\nSince player A takes the money on the 10th round, the game ends and player B keeps their current amount. Therefore, player B ends up with $95."
