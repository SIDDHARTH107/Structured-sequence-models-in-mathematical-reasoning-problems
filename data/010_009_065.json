    "message_1": "Consider a square with side length 4 units. Triangulate the square by dividing it up into triangles such that no two triangles overlap and every vertex of the square is a vertex of at least one triangle. How many triangles are needed to triangulate the square?",
    "message_2": "To triangulate the square, we can divide it into two triangles by drawing a diagonal from one vertex to the opposite vertex. This will create two right triangles, each with legs of length 4 units and a hypotenuse of length 4âˆš2 units. So, we need 2 triangles to triangulate the square."
