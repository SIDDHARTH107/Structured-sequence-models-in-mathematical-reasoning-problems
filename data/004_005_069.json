    "message_2": "To find the particular solution of the given differential equation y' + 2y = 6x, we will first find the complementary function by solving the homogeneous equation y' + 2y = 0, and then find the particular integral by using an appropriate trial function for the non-homogeneous equation.\n\nStep 1: Find the complementary function\nThe homogeneous equation is y' + 2y = 0. This is a first-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. We can rewrite it as y' = -2y. To solve this equation, we can use the integrating factor method.\n\nThe integrating factor is e^(∫P(x)dx), where P(x) is the coefficient of y in the given equation. In this case, P(x) = 2. So, the integrating factor is e^(∫2dx) = e^(2x).\n\nNow, multiply the given equation by the integrating factor e^(2x):\n\ne^(2x)y' + 2e^(2x)y = 0\n\nThe left side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:\n\n(d/dx)[y * e^(2x)] = 0\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(d/dx)[y * e^(2x)] dx = ∫0 dx\n\ny * e^(2x) = C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny(x) = C * e^(-2x)\n\nThis is the complementary function.\n\nStep 2: Find the particular integral\nFor the non-homogeneous equation y' + 2y = 6x, we can use a trial function of the form y_p(x) = Ax + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nNow, find the first derivative of y_p(x):\n\ny_p'(x) = A\n\nSubstitute y_p(x) and y_p'(x) into the non-homogeneous equation:\n\nA + 2(Ax + B) = 6x\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nA + 2Ax + 2B = 6x\n\nNow, equate the coefficients of the powers of x:\n\nFor x^0: A + 2B = 0\nFor x^1: 2A = 6\n\nSolve the system of equations:\n\nFrom the second equation, we get A = 3. Substitute this value into the first equation:\n\n3 + 2B = 0\n\nSolve for B:\n\nB = -3/2\n\nSo, the particular integral is y_p(x) = 3x - 3/2.\n\nStep 3: Find the particular solution\nThe particular solution is the sum of the complementary function and the particular integral:\n\ny(x) = (C * e^(-2x)) + (3x - 3/2)\n\nNow, use the initial condition y(0) = 4:\n\n4 = (C * e^(0)) + (3(0) - 3/2)\n\nSolve for C:\n\nC = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(x) = (11/2) * e^(-2x) + 3x - 3/2."
