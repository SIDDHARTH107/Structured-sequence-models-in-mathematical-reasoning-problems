    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using block matrices, we first represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 5  6  7 |\n    | 8  9 10 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    | 23 |\n    | 35 |\n\nNow, we can partition the matrix A into blocks. Since it's a 3x3 matrix, we can partition it into 2x2 and 1x1 blocks:\n\nA = | A11 A12 | = |  2  3 |  4  = |  2  3 |  |  4 |\n    | A21 A22 |   |  5  6 |  7      |  5  6 |  |  7 |\n                  |  8  9 | 10      |  8  9 |  | 10 |\n\nNow, we can rewrite the matrix equation AX = B in terms of the block matrices:\n\n| A11 A12 | | x |   | 11 |\n| A21 A22 | | y | = | 23 |\n            | z |   | 35 |\n\nWe can multiply the block matrices and equate the resulting blocks to the corresponding entries in B:\n\nA11 * x + A12 * y = 11\nA21 * x + A22 * z = 23\nA12 * y + A22 * z = 35\n\nNow, we can solve the block system of equations. First, we solve for x from the first equation:\n\nx = A11^(-1) * (11 - A12 * y)\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for x into the second equation and solve for y:\n\nA21 * (A11^(-1) * (11 - A12 * y)) + A22 * z = 23\n\nNow, we can solve for z from the third equation:\n\nz = A22^(-1) * (35 - A12 * y)\n\nFinally, we can substitute the expressions for x and z back into the first equation to get the solution for y:\n\nx = A11^(-1) * (11 - A12 * (A22^(-1) * (35 - A12 * y)))\n\nNow, we can compute the inverse of A11 and A22:\n\nA11 = | 2  3 |\n      | 5  6 |\n\nA11^(-1) = 1/(2*6 - 3*5) * |  6 -3 |\n                             | -5  2 |\n\nA11^(-1) = 1/-3 * |  6 -3 |\n                   | -5  2 |\n\nA11^(-1) = | -2  1 |\n           |  5/3 -2/3 |\n\nA22 = 10\n\nA22^(-1) = 1/10\n\nNow, we can substitute these inverses back into the expressions for x, y, and z:\n\nx = | -2  1 | * (11 - |  4 | * (1/10 * (35 - |  4 | * y)))\n    |  5/3 -2/3 |     |  7 |       |  7 |       |  7 |\n\nAfter performing the matrix multiplications and simplifying the expressions, we get:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
