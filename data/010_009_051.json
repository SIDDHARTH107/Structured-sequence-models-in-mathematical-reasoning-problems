    "message_2": "Let's choose three interior points A, B, and C such that A is on the line segment connecting (0,0) and (0,5), B is on the line segment connecting (0,0) and (5,0), and C is on the line segment connecting (5,0) and (0,5). \n\nNow, connect these three interior points to form a triangle. This divides the original triangle into three smaller triangles. Also, connect each interior point to the vertices of the original triangle. This creates three more triangles. In total, there are 1 (interior triangle) + 3 (smaller triangles) + 3 (triangles connected to the vertices) = 7 triangles in this triangulation."
