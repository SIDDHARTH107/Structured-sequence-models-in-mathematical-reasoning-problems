    "message_2": "To find the next term of the sequence using the principle of mathematical induction, we first need to identify the pattern or rule that generates the sequence. In this case, the sequence appears to be an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n\nThe general formula for an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nan = a1 + (n-1)d\n\nwhere an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, a1 = 3 and d = 2. We want to find the 6th term (n = 6) of the sequence.\n\na6 = 3 + (6-1)2\na6 = 3 + (5)2\na6 = 3 + 10\na6 = 13\n\nSo, the next term of the sequence is 13."
