    "message_2": "To determine the type of singularity of the function f(z) = 3z^3 / (z-1) at z=1, we first need to rewrite the function in terms of the variable (z-1). Let's perform a change of variable: w = z - 1, so z = w + 1. Now, we can rewrite the function in terms of w:\n\nf(w) = 3(w+1)^3 / w\n\nNow, we can analyze the singularity at w=0 (which corresponds to z=1 in the original function). The function has a simple pole at w=0, as the numerator is nonzero and the denominator has a single power of w. Therefore, the type of singularity of the function f(z) = 3z^3 / (z-1) at z=1 is a simple pole."
