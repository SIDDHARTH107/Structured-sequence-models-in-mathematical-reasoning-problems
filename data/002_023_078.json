    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 centimeters, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (5^2)\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * 25\n\nSurface area = 100π\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 square centimeters."
