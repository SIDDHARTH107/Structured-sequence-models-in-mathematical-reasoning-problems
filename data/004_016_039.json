    "message_2": "To find the average acceleration of the car over the time interval t=2 to t=6 seconds, we need to know the velocity of the car at t=6 seconds. However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the velocity at t=6 seconds. \n\nThe Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a number c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b]. In this case, the function is the position function of the car, and its derivative is the velocity function.\n\nTo apply the Mean Value Theorem, we need the position function of the car, which is not provided in the problem. Without the position function or the velocity at t=6 seconds, we cannot determine the average acceleration of the car over the time interval t=2 to t=6 seconds using the Mean Value Theorem."
