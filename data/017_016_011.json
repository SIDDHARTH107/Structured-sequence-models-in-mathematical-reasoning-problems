    "message_2": "Since G has order 27, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a subgroup of G of order 9, which we will call H. The order of H is 9, and since 9 is a prime power (3^2), H is a p-group and therefore has a non-trivial center. Let Z(H) denote the center of H. Since Z(H) is non-trivial, it must have order 3 or 9.\n\nCase 1: |Z(H)| = 3\nIn this case, Z(H) is a subgroup of H of order 3, and since H is a subgroup of G, Z(H) is also a subgroup of G. Thus, we have found a subgroup of G of order 3. By the Sylow theorems, all subgroups of order 3 in G are conjugate, and the number of such subgroups is equal to n_3, where n_3 is the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since |G| = 27 = 3^3, we know that n_3 must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_3 â‰¡ 1 (mod 3). The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 9. If n_3 = 1, then G has a unique subgroup of order 3, and G must be cyclic (isomorphic to C27). If n_3 = 9, then G has 9 subgroups of order 3, each with 2 non-identity elements, giving a total of 9 * 2 = 18 elements of order 3 in G. In this case, G cannot be cyclic, and it must be the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nCase 2: |Z(H)| = 9\nIn this case, the center of H is equal to H itself, which means H is abelian. Since H has order 9, it must be isomorphic to either C9 or C3 x C3. If H is isomorphic to C9, then H has 6 elements of order 3, and G has at least 6 elements of order 3. If H is isomorphic to C3 x C3, then H has 4 elements of order 3, and G has at least 4 elements of order 3. In either case, G cannot be cyclic, since a cyclic group of order 27 has exactly 9 elements of order 3. Therefore, G must be the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, we can determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27 by finding the number of elements of G of order 3. If there are exactly 9 elements of order 3, then G is isomorphic to C27. If there are fewer than 9 elements of order 3, then G is the non-abelian group of order 27."
