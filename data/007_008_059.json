    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, if we raise a to the power of p and divide by p, the remainder is a. We can also write this as a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) when a and p are coprime (i.e., they share no common factors other than 1).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the remainder when 7^12 is divided by 13. Since 7 and 13 are coprime, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^(13-1) ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\n7^12 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^12 is divided by 13 is 1."
