    "message_2": "To determine the possible number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group divides the order of the group and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nThe prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. Thus, we have to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nSylow 2-subgroups:\nLet n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. By the second Sylow theorem, n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 3, then there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, and we cannot guarantee that any of them are normal.\n\nSylow 3-subgroups:\nLet n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By the second Sylow theorem, n_3 divides 16 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and we cannot guarantee that any of them are normal.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. A unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup:\nIn this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, i.e., G ≅ (Z_2)^4 × Z_3. This is one possible non-isomorphic group of order 48.\n\n2. A unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups:\nIn this case, the group is a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups. There are two possible actions of Z_3 on (Z_2)^4, which correspond to two non-isomorphic semi-direct products: G ≅ (Z_2)^4 ⋊ Z_3 and G ≅ (Z_2)^4 ⋊ Z_3', where Z_3 and Z_3' are two distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 3. This gives us two more non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\n3. 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup:\nIn this case, the group is a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups. There are five possible actions of (Z_2)^4 on Z_3, which correspond to five non-isomorphic semi-direct products: G ≅ Z_3 ⋊ (Z_2)^4, G ≅ Z_3 ⋊ (Z_2)^4', G ≅ Z_3 ⋊ (Z_2)^4'', G ≅ Z_3 ⋊ (Z_2)^4''', and G ≅ Z_3 ⋊ (Z_2)^4'''', where (Z_2)^4, (Z_2)^4', (Z_2)^4'', (Z_2)^4''', and (Z_2)^4'''' are five distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 16. This gives us five more non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\n4. 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups:\nIn this case, we cannot guarantee the existence of a normal Sylow subgroup, so we cannot construct a group using semi-direct products.\n\nIn total, we have found 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 possible non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
