    "message_2": "To find the complement of a set X, we need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of X, denoted by X', is the set of all elements in U that are not in X. Since you didn't provide a universal set, I will assume the universal set U consists of the first 10 positive integers: U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of X with respect to U. The complement of X, X', contains all the elements in U that are not in X. \n\nX' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}\n\nTo show that this complement is unique, we need to prove that there is no other set Y' that is also a complement of X with respect to U. Suppose there is another set Y' that is a complement of X. Then, by definition, Y' must contain all the elements in U that are not in X. Since X' also contains all the elements in U that are not in X, it follows that X' = Y'. Therefore, the complement of X is unique."
