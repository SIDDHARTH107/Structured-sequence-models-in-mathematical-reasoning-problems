    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(2x + 3) = 5, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(2x + 3))^2 = 5^2\n\nNow, we can simplify:\n\n2x + 3 = 25\n\nNext, we need to isolate the variable x. To do this, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 22\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 11\n\nSo, the solution to the radical equation √(2x + 3) = 5 is x = 11."
