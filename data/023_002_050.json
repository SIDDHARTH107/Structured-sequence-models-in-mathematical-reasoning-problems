    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the a_n coefficients.\n\nThe formulas for the coefficients are:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx, for n ≥ 1\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\na_0 = (1/π) * [(x^3)/3] | from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [(π^3)/3 - (-π^3)/3]\na_0 = (2π^2)/3\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\n\nIntegration by parts:\nu = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/n) * sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(x^2 * (1/n) * sin(nx)) | from -π to π - ∫[-π, π] (1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x dx]\n\nSince sin(nπ) and sin(-nπ) are both 0 for integer values of n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [0 - (2/n) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we need to integrate x * sin(nx) dx. We'll use integration by parts again:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula again:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [0 - (2/n) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n) * ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx]]\n\nThe integral of cos(nx) over [-π, π] is zero, so:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [0 - (2/n) * (-x/n) * cos(nx) | from -π to π]\na_n = (2/πn) * [π * cos(nπ) - (-π) * cos(-nπ)]\n\nFor even values of n, cos(nπ) = 1 and cos(-nπ) = 1. For odd values of n, cos(nπ) = -1 and cos(-nπ) = -1. Therefore:\n\na_n = (4π/n^2) for even n\na_n = 0 for odd n\n\nNow we have the Fourier series for f(x) = x^2:\n\nf(x) = (π^2)/3 + Σ[(4π/n^2) * cos(nx)] for even n\n\nSince f(x) is continuous and has continuous derivatives on the interval [-π, π], the Fourier series converges to f(x) = x^2 on this interval."
