    "message_2": "A Morse function on a compact surface $X$ is a smooth function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that all critical points (points where the gradient is zero) are non-degenerate (the Hessian matrix is non-singular). The Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of a Morse function to the topology of the surface.\n\nLet $n_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$ (i.e., with $k$ negative eigenvalues of the Hessian). Then, the Morse inequalities state that\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^2 (-1)^k n_k = \\chi(X),$$\n\nwhere $\\chi(X)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface $X$. For a compact surface with genus $g$ and $b$ boundary components, the Euler characteristic is given by\n\n$$\\chi(X) = 2 - 2g - b.$$\n\nNow, we want to minimize the number of critical points, i.e., minimize $\\sum_{k=0}^2 n_k$. Since $n_k \\geq 0$ for all $k$, we have\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^2 (-1)^k n_k \\geq n_0 - n_1 + n_2 \\geq 0.$$\n\nThus, we get\n\n$$2 - 2g - b \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow n_0 - n_1 + n_2 \\geq 2g + b - 2.$$\n\nNow, we know that there must be at least one minimum ($n_0 \\geq 1$) and one maximum ($n_2 \\geq 1$) for a Morse function on a compact surface. Moreover, if there is a boundary, there must be at least one saddle point ($n_1 \\geq 1$ for $b > 0$) to connect the boundary components. Therefore, we have the following cases:\n\n1. If $b = 0$, then $n_0 \\geq 1$, $n_1 \\geq 0$, and $n_2 \\geq 1$. In this case, the minimum number of critical points is $n_0 + n_1 + n_2 \\geq 1 + 0 + 1 = 2$.\n\n2. If $b > 0$, then $n_0 \\geq 1$, $n_1 \\geq 1$, and $n_2 \\geq 1$. In this case, the minimum number of critical points is $n_0 + n_1 + n_2 \\geq 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of critical points that a Morse function on a compact surface $X$ with genus $g$ and $b$ boundary components can have is\n\n$$\\min\\{n_0 + n_1 + n_2\\} = \\begin{cases}\n2, & \\text{if } b = 0, \\\\\n3, & \\text{if } b > 0.\n\\end{cases}$$"
