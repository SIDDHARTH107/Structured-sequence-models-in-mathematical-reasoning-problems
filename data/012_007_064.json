    "message_1": "In a transportation network, there are four cities connected by five roads as shown in the diagram below:\n\n```\nA -----5---- B\n|\\         / |\n2 \\       / 3\n  \\     /   |\n   \\   /    |\n    \\ /     |\n    C -----4- D\n```\n\nThe numbers on the roads indicate their capacities in units of flow per hour. What is the maximum flow that can be transported from City A to City D per hour?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from City A to City D, we will use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We start by initializing the flow on each road to 0. Then, we find an augmenting path from City A to City D and increase the flow along that path. We repeat this process until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from A to D: A -> B -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 3 (the capacity of the road from B to D). We increase the flow along this path by 3.\n\n```\nA -----2---- B\n|\\         / |\n2 \\       / 0\n  \\     /   |\n   \\   /    |\n    \\ /     |\n    C -----4- D\n```\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: A -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 (the capacity of the road from A to C). We increase the flow along this path by 2.\n\n```\nA -----2---- B\n|\\         / |\n0 \\       / 0\n  \\     /   |\n   \\   /    |\n    \\ /     |\n    C -----2- D\n```\n\n3. Now, we find another augmenting path: A -> B -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 1 (the capacity of the road from B to C). We increase the flow along this path by 1.\n\n```\nA -----1---- B\n|\\         / |\n0 \\       / 1\n  \\     /   |\n   \\   /    |\n    \\ /     |\n    C -----3- D\n```\n\n4. At this point, we cannot find any more augmenting paths from A to D. The flow has reached its maximum value.\n\nThe maximum flow from City A to City D is the sum of the flows on the roads leading into City D, which is 3 (from B to D) + 2 (from C to D) = 5 units of flow per hour."
