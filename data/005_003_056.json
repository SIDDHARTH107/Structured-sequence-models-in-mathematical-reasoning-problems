    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) using the following formulas:\n\nm = (n * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy) / (n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)\nb = (Σy - m * Σx) / n\n\nwhere n is the number of data points, Σxy is the sum of the product of each x and y value, Σx and Σy are the sum of the x and y values, and Σ(x^2) is the sum of the square of each x value.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the necessary sums:\n\nΣx = 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 73\nΣy = 68 + 75 + 93 + 86 + 85 + 92 + 98 + 96 + 100 + 105 = 898\nΣ(xy) = (2*68) + (3*75) + (5*93) + (6*86) + (7*85) + (8*92) + (9*98) + (10*96) + (11*100) + (12*105) = 6174\nΣ(x^2) = 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 517\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (m) and y-intercept (b):\n\nn = 10 (number of data points)\n\nm = (10 * 6174 - 73 * 898) / (10 * 517 - 73^2) = (61740 - 65554) / (5170 - 5329) = -380 / -159 = 2.389\n\nb = (898 - 2.389 * 73) / 10 = (898 - 174.297) / 10 = 723.703 / 10 = 72.37\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line is:\n\ny = 2.389x + 72.37\n\nNow, we can predict the test score for a student who studied for 4 hours:\n\ny = 2.389 * 4 + 72.37 = 9.556 + 72.37 = 81.926\n\nThe predicted test score for a student who studied for 4 hours is approximately 81.93."
