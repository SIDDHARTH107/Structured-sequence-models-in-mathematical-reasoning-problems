    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0.\n\nThe Fourier series for a function f(x) on the interval [-π, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFor f(x) = x^2, we can compute the coefficients as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx = (1/π) * [(x^3)/3] | (-π to π) = (2/3) * π^2\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\nSince x^2 is an even function and cos(nx) is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\nUsing integration by parts twice, we find:\na_n = (2/π) * [(2*(-1)^n)/(n^3)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * sin(nx) dx = 0\nSince x^2 is an even function and sin(nx) is an odd function, their product is an odd function, and the integral over the symmetric interval is zero.\n\nNow we have the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x^2:\n\nx^2 = (π^2/3) + Σ [(4*(-1)^n)/(n^2 * π) * cos(nx)]\n\nThe Fourier series converges to the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π] by the Dirichlet's theorem, as f(x) is continuous and has continuous derivatives on the given interval."
