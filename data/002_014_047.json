    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, width of 3 cm, and height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the prism in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 of each type (length x width, length x height, and width x height).\n\n1. Length x Width: 5 cm x 3 cm = 15 square centimeters\n2. Length x Height: 5 cm x 4 cm = 20 square centimeters\n3. Width x Height: 3 cm x 4 cm = 12 square centimeters\n\nNow, we add the areas of each type of face together and multiply by 2 (since there are 2 of each type of face):\n\n(15 + 20 + 12) x 2 = 47 x 2 = 94 square centimeters\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 94 square centimeters."
