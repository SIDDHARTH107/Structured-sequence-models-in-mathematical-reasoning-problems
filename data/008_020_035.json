    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, I will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by -1:\n\n(3)(x - 2y + 4z) = (3)(1)\n(-1)(3x - y - 2z) = (-1)(2)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n3x - 6y + 12z = 3\n-3x + y + 2z = -2\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n3x - 6y + 12z - 3x + y + 2z = 3 - 2\n-5y + 14z = 1\n\nNow we have a new equation with only y and z:\n\n-5y + 14z = 1 (1)\n\nNext, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by -3 and the third equation by 2:\n\n(-3)(2x + 3y - 5z) = (-3)(11)\n(2)(3x - y - 2z) = (2)(2)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n-6x - 9y + 15z = -33\n6x - 2y - 4z = 4\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n-6x - 9y + 15z + 6x - 2y - 4z = -33 + 4\n-11y + 11z = -29\n\nNow we have another equation with only y and z:\n\n-11y + 11z = -29 (2)\n\nNow, let's solve equation (1) for y:\n\n-5y + 14z = 1\n-5y = -14z + 1\ny = (14/5)z - 1/5\n\nNow substitute this expression for y in equation (2):\n\n-11((14/5)z - 1/5) + 11z = -29\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate fractions:\n\n-11(14z - 1) + 55z = -145\n\nDistribute:\n\n-154z + 11 + 55z = -145\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-99z = -156\n\nNow, divide by -99:\n\nz = 156 / 99\nz = 52 / 33\n\nNow substitute the value of z back into the expression for y:\n\ny = (14/5)(52/33) - 1/5\ny = (14 * 52) / (5 * 33) - 1/5\ny = 728 / 165 - 1/5\ny = (728 - 33) / 165\ny = 695 / 165\ny = 139 / 33\n\nNow substitute the values of y and z back into one of the original equations to find x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(139/33) - 5(52/33) = 11\n\nMultiply both sides by 33 to eliminate fractions:\n\n2x + 3(139) - 5(52) = 11 * 33\n\nDistribute:\n\n2x + 417 - 260 = 363\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x = 206\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\nx = 103\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 103\ny = 139/33\nz = 52/33"
