    "message_2": "To apply the Schwarz reflection principle, we first define a new function $g(z)$ on the entire complex plane as follows:\n\n$$\ng(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) > 0 \\\\\n\\overline{f(\\overline{z})} & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is real-valued on the real axis, we have $f(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{f(z)}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $g(z)$ is continuous on the real axis. Moreover, $g(z)$ is analytic in both the upper and lower half-planes because $f(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane and its conjugate is analytic in the lower half-plane. By the Schwarz reflection principle, $g(z)$ is analytic on the entire complex plane.\n\nNow, consider the function $h(z) = g(z)g(-z)$. This function is also analytic on the entire complex plane, and it is real-valued on the real axis since $g(z)$ and $g(-z)$ are complex conjugates for $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. By the maximum modulus principle, the maximum value of $|h(z)|$ on the imaginary axis occurs at a point where $z = iy$ for some $y > 0$. Let $z_0 = iy_0$ be such a point. Then,\n\n$$\n|h(z_0)| = |g(z_0)g(-z_0)| = |f(iy_0)f(-iy_0)| = |f(iy_0)|^2.\n$$\n\nSince $|f(z)| \\leq M$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$, we have $|f(iy_0)| \\leq M$. Therefore, the maximum possible value of $|f(iy)|$ for $y > 0$ is $M$."
