    "message_2": "To find the frequency and amplitude of the two sinusoidal components in f(t) using the Fourier transform, we first need to express the given function as a sum of sine and cosine functions with their respective frequencies and amplitudes.\n\nThe given function is:\n\nf(t) = sin(2πt) + cos(4πt)\n\nThis function is already expressed as a sum of sine and cosine functions. Now, we can identify the frequencies and amplitudes of the two sinusoidal components.\n\n1. The first sinusoidal component is a sine function:\n\nsin(2πt)\n\nThe frequency of this component can be found by looking at the argument of the sine function, which is 2πt. The coefficient of t is 2π, so the angular frequency (ω) is 2π. To find the frequency (f) in Hz, we can use the relationship:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\n\nFor the first component:\n\nf1 = (2π) / (2π) = 1 Hz\n\nThe amplitude of the first component is the coefficient of the sine function, which is 1.\n\nA1 = 1\n\n2. The second sinusoidal component is a cosine function:\n\ncos(4πt)\n\nThe frequency of this component can be found by looking at the argument of the cosine function, which is 4πt. The coefficient of t is 4π, so the angular frequency (ω) is 4π. To find the frequency (f) in Hz, we can use the relationship:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\n\nFor the second component:\n\nf2 = (4π) / (2π) = 2 Hz\n\nThe amplitude of the second component is the coefficient of the cosine function, which is 1.\n\nA2 = 1\n\nSo, the two sinusoidal components of the function f(t) have frequencies of 1 Hz and 2 Hz, and both have amplitudes of 1."
