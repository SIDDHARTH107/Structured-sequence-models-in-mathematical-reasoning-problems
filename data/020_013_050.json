    "message_2": "First, let's verify the positive semidefiniteness of the matrix [2, -1; -1, 2]. The eigenvalues of this matrix are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = 1, both of which are non-negative. Therefore, the matrix is positive semidefinite.\n\nNow, let's solve the linear inequalities:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 1\n2. x + 2y ≤ 1\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nWe can rewrite the inequalities as:\n\n1. y ≤ -2x + 1\n2. y ≤ -(1/2)x + 1/2\n\nNow, let's find the intersection points of these inequalities:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\n-2x + 1 = -(1/2)x + 1/2\n(3/2)x = 1/2\nx = 1/3\n\nPlugging x back into (1):\ny = -2(1/3) + 1 = 1/3\n\nSo, the intersection point is (1/3, 1/3).\n\nNow, let's find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the objective function x + y. Since the feasible region is a triangle with vertices (0,0), (1/2, 0), and (1/3, 1/3), we can evaluate the objective function at these vertices:\n\n1. x + y at (0,0) = 0\n2. x + y at (1/2, 0) = 1/2\n3. x + y at (1/3, 1/3) = 2/3\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 2/3, which occurs at the point (1/3, 1/3). Therefore, the optimal values of x and y are x = 1/3 and y = 1/3."
