The following table shows the number of workers required during different hours in a day:\n\n| Hour | Number of Workers Required |\n|------|----------------------------|\n|  8   |             3              |\n|  9   |             6              |\n|  10  |             8              |\n|  11  |             7              |\n|  12  |             5              |\n|  13  |             4              |\n|  14  |             5              |\n|  15  |             7              |\n|  16  |             8              |\n\nAssuming that each worker is paid $10 per hour and can work for a maximum of 9 hours per day. Determine the minimum cost of scheduling workers to meet the demand for each hour.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost, we need to find the optimal way to schedule workers for their 7-hour shifts. We can create different groups of workers based on their starting hours and calculate the total number of workers needed for each group.\n\nGroup 1: Workers starting at 8:00\n- They will work from 8:00 to 15:00 (7 hours)\n- Number of workers needed: 3 (to cover the demand at 8:00)\n\nGroup 2: Workers starting at 9:00\n- They will work from 9:00 to 16:00 (7 hours)\n- Number of workers needed: 6 - 3 = 3 (to cover the demand at 9:00, considering the workers from Group 1)\n\nGroup 3: Workers starting at 10:00\n- They will work from 10:00 to 17:00 (7 hours)\n- Number of workers needed: 8 - 3 = 5 (to cover the demand at 10:00, considering the workers from Group 1)\n\nGroup 4: Workers starting at 11:00\n- They will work from 11:00 to 18:00 (7 hours)\n- Number of workers needed: 7 - 5 = 2 (to cover the demand at 11:00, considering the workers from Group 3)\n\nGroup 5: Workers starting at 12:00\n- They will work from 12:00 to 19:00 (7 hours)\n- Number of workers needed: 5 - 2 = 3 (to cover the demand at 12:00, considering the workers from Group 4)\n\nGroup 6: Workers starting at 13:00\n- They will work from 13:00 to 20:00 (7 hours)\n- Number of workers needed: 4 - 3 = 1 (to cover the demand at 13:00, considering the workers from Group 5)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of workers needed and the cost:\n\nTotal workers needed = 3 (Group 1) + 3 (Group 2) + 5 (Group 3) + 2 (Group 4) + 3 (Group 5) + 1 (Group 6) = 17 workers\n\nEach worker works 7 hours a day and is paid $10 per hour, so the cost per worker per day is 7 * $10 = $70.\n\nMinimum cost = 17 workers * $70 per worker = $1,190 per day."
