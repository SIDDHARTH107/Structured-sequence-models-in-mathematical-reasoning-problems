    "message_2": "To find the phase shift of the given trigonometric function, we need to look at the argument of the sine function, which is (3x - π/4). The general form of a sine function with phase shift is y = A*sin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, A = 2, B = 3, and C = π/4. The phase shift is given by C/B, which is:\n\nPhase shift = (π/4) / 3 = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function y = 2sin(3x - π/4) is π/12."
