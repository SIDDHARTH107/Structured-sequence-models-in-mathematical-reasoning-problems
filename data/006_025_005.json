    "message_1": "During a dance performance, there are 5 salsa dancers, 3 hip hop dancers, and 2 ballroom dancers. If a spectator randomly chooses one dancer to be their favorite, what is the probability that the chosen dancer is a ballroom dancer?",
    "message_2": "There are a total of 5 salsa dancers + 3 hip hop dancers + 2 ballroom dancers = 10 dancers in the performance.\n\nThe probability of choosing a ballroom dancer as a favorite is the number of ballroom dancers divided by the total number of dancers. So, the probability is 2 ballroom dancers / 10 total dancers = 1/5 or 0.2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the chosen dancer is a ballroom dancer is 1/5 or 20%."
