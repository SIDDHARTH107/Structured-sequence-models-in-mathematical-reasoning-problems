    "message_1": "If a right triangle has a leg of length 5 and a hypotenuse of length 13, what is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \"b\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe know that one leg (a) has a length of 5, and the hypotenuse (c) has a length of 13. So we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n5^2 + b^2 = 13^2\n\n25 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow we need to solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 169 - 25\nb^2 = 144\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), we take the square root of 144:\n\nb = âˆš144\nb = 12\n\nSo the length of the other leg is 12."
