    "message_2": "We will use the power iteration method to find the dominant eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of the matrix A = [3 2; 2 4]. We start with an initial guess of x0 = [1; 1].\n\n1. Multiply A by x0: Ax0 = [3*1 + 2*1; 2*1 + 4*1] = [5; 6]\n2. Normalize the result: x1 = [5/√61; 6/√61]\n3. Multiply A by x1: Ax1 = [3*(5/√61) + 2*(6/√61); 2*(5/√61) + 4*(6/√61)] = [5.5738; 6.6893]\n4. Normalize the result: x2 = [5.5738/√74.9997; 6.6893/√74.9997] = [0.6417; 0.7669]\n5. Multiply A by x2: Ax2 = [3*0.6417 + 2*0.7669; 2*0.6417 + 4*0.7669] = [3.2292; 3.8710]\n6. Normalize the result: x3 = [3.2292/√19.9999; 3.8710/√19.9999] = [0.7245; 0.8694]\n\nWe continue this process until the result converges to at least 4 decimal places.\n\n7. Ax3 = [4.9998; 6.0002], x4 = [0.6249; 0.7807]\n8. Ax4 = [3.2499; 3.8751], x5 = [0.7249; 0.8689]\n9. Ax5 = [5.0002; 6.0000], x6 = [0.6249; 0.7807]\n10. Ax6 = [3.2500; 3.8750], x7 = [0.7249; 0.8689]\n\nAt this point, the results have converged to at least 4 decimal places. The dominant eigenvalue can be found by taking the dot product of A times the eigenvector and dividing by the eigenvector:\n\nλ = (A * x7) / x7 = [3.2500; 3.8750] / [0.7249; 0.8689] ≈ [4.4807; 4.4609]\n\nThe dominant eigenvalue is approximately 4.4708 (average of 4.4807 and 4.4609). The corresponding eigenvector is [0.7249; 0.8689]."
