    "message_2": "In the simplicial complex K, there are three vertices (v1, v2, and v3) and three edges connecting them in a triangle. A 2-simplex (triangle) is formed by connecting three vertices with three edges.\n\nIn this case, there is only one possible 2-simplex (triangle) that can be formed using all three vertices and edges, which is the triangle with vertices v1, v2, and v3.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 2-simplex (triangle) in the simplicial complex K."
