    "message_2": "Let's consider two even numbers, a and b. By definition, an even number can be expressed as the product of 2 and some integer. So, we can write:\n\na = 2m (where m is an integer)\nb = 2n (where n is an integer)\n\nNow, we want to show that the sum of these two even numbers is also an even number. So, we add a and b:\n\na + b = 2m + 2n\n\nWe can factor out a 2 from both terms:\n\na + b = 2(m + n)\n\nSince m and n are both integers, their sum (m + n) is also an integer. Let's call this integer k:\n\nk = m + n\n\nNow, we can rewrite the sum of a and b as:\n\na + b = 2k\n\nSince k is an integer, and a + b is a product of 2 and an integer, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers (a + b) is also an even number. This completes the direct proof."
