    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of Ext^i(O_X, O_X), we will use the Yoneda Ext-algebra and the Serre duality theorem.\n\nFirst, recall that the Yoneda Ext-algebra is given by:\n\nExt^*(O_X, O_X) = ⊕_i Ext^i(O_X, O_X)\n\nNow, let's consider the Serre duality theorem, which states that for a smooth projective variety X over a field k, we have:\n\nExt^i(F, G) ≅ Ext^{n-i}(G, F ⊗ ω_X)^*\n\nwhere F and G are coherent sheaves on X, n = dim(X), ω_X is the canonical sheaf of X, and * denotes the dual space (i.e., the space of linear functionals).\n\nIn our case, F = G = O_X, so we have:\n\nExt^i(O_X, O_X) ≅ Ext^{n-i}(O_X, O_X ⊗ ω_X)^*\n\nSince O_X is the structure sheaf, O_X ⊗ ω_X ≅ ω_X. Now, we know that H^n(X, O_X) ≅ k for all n, and by the Hodge decomposition theorem, we have:\n\nH^n(X, ω_X) ≅ ⊕_p H^p(X, Ω_X^q)\n\nwhere Ω_X^q is the sheaf of q-differential forms on X, and p + q = n.\n\nNow, we can compute the dimensions of Ext^i(O_X, O_X) for i = 1, 2, 3.\n\n1. For i = 1, we have:\n\nExt^1(O_X, O_X) ≅ Ext^{n-1}(O_X, ω_X)^*\n\nSince H^n(X, O_X) ≅ k for all n, we have H^{n-1}(X, ω_X) ≅ k. Therefore, the dimension of Ext^1(O_X, O_X) is 1.\n\n2. For i = 2, we have:\n\nExt^2(O_X, O_X) ≅ Ext^{n-2}(O_X, ω_X)^*\n\nSince H^n(X, O_X) ≅ k for all n, we have H^{n-2}(X, ω_X) ≅ k. Therefore, the dimension of Ext^2(O_X, O_X) is 1.\n\n3. For i = 3, we have:\n\nExt^3(O_X, O_X) ≅ Ext^{n-3}(O_X, ω_X)^*\n\nSince H^n(X, O_X) ≅ k for all n, we have H^{n-3}(X, ω_X) ≅ k. Therefore, the dimension of Ext^3(O_X, O_X) is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the dimensions of Ext^i(O_X, O_X) for i = 1, 2, 3 are all 1."
