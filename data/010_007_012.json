    "message_2": "Let's denote the basepoint in Y as y, where p(y) = x. Since p: Y → X is a covering space, we can apply the lifting criterion for covering spaces. This states that there exists a unique lift of any loop in X based at x to a loop in Y based at y, if and only if the loop in X is in the image of the induced homomorphism p_*: π(Y, y) → π(X, x).\n\nNow, since p⁻¹(x) has cardinality 4, we know that the covering space Y is a 4-fold cover of X. This implies that the index of the image of p_* in π(X, x) is 4. In other words, the image of p_* is a subgroup of π(X, x) with index 4.\n\nSince π(X, x) = ℤ, the only subgroup of index 4 is the subgroup 4ℤ, which consists of all integer multiples of 4. Therefore, the image of p_* is 4ℤ.\n\nNow, we can apply the covering space correspondence theorem, which states that there is a bijection between the subgroups of π(X, x) and the connected covering spaces of X. In our case, the subgroup 4ℤ corresponds to the covering space Y.\n\nThe covering space correspondence theorem also states that the fundamental group of the covering space Y is isomorphic to the quotient group π(X, x) / 4ℤ. Since π(X, x) = ℤ, we have:\n\nπ(Y, y) ≅ ℤ / 4ℤ\n\nThis is the quotient group of integers modulo 4, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 4:\n\nπ(Y, y) ≅ ℤ_4\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the covering space Y is ℤ_4, the cyclic group of order 4."
