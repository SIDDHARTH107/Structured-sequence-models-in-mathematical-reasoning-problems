    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is generated through a series of iterations. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases. The length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (Scaling factor)^n\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the scaling factor is 7^(1/2), which is approximately 2.645751311.\n\nSo, to find the total length of the Gosper curve after four iterations, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2.645751311)^4\n\nLength â‰ˆ 48.7548\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Gosper curve after four iterations is approximately 48.7548 units."
