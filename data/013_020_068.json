    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest game where there are 10 players who need to select a number between 0 and 100. The winner will be the person whose number is the closest to 2/3 of the average of all the selected numbers. If two or more players select the same closest number, they will share the prize equally. What number should you select to have the best chance of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning the game, you should try to guess what the average of the other players' guesses will be, and then choose 2/3 of that average. This is because the winning number is determined by the average of all the selected numbers, and you want to be as close as possible to 2/3 of that average.\n\nLet's assume that the other players are also rational and will choose numbers based on the same logic. If all players think that the others will choose numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 100, the average of their guesses would be 50. In this case, you should choose 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players think like this, the actual average of the guesses will be lower than 50, since everyone is choosing a number around 33.33. So, you should adjust your guess accordingly. If you assume that the other players will choose numbers around 33.33, the average of their guesses would be around 33.33, and you should choose 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nThis process can be repeated iteratively, with each step assuming that the other players are also adjusting their guesses based on the previous step. After several iterations, the guesses will converge to a value close to 0. However, since the game has a finite number of players and the numbers must be between 0 and 100, the optimal strategy would be to choose a number slightly above 0, as choosing 0 itself would not give you any chance of winning if the average is not exactly 0.\n\nIn conclusion, to maximize your chances of winning the game, you should choose a number slightly above 0, taking into account that the other players are also trying to guess 2/3 of the average of the selected numbers."
