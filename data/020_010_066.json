Specifically, the production of type A can vary by ±5% and the production of type B can vary by ±7%. The company wants to determine the optimal production quantities of each product to maximize their profit, while accounting for the uncertainty in the production process.\n\nLet x be the number of units of type A and y be the number of units of type B that the company produces. The profit from selling type A is $10 per unit and the profit from selling type B is $12 per unit. The company estimates that it will sell at least 100 units of each product.\n\nWrite a robust optimization problem to maximize the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "To formulate the robust optimization problem, we need to account for the uncertainty in the production process. We can represent the uncertainty using the following variables:\n\n- x_actual: actual number of units of type A produced\n- y_actual: actual number of units of type B produced\n\nSince the production of type A can vary by ±5%, we have:\n\nx_actual = x * (1 ± 0.05)\n\nSimilarly, for type B, which can vary by ±7%, we have:\n\ny_actual = y * (1 ± 0.07)\n\nNow, we can write the profit function as:\n\nProfit = 10 * x_actual + 12 * y_actual\n\nOur goal is to maximize the profit while considering the uncertainty in the production process. Therefore, the robust optimization problem can be formulated as:\n\nMaximize: Profit = 10 * x_actual + 12 * y_actual\n\nSubject to:\n\n1. x_actual = x * (1 ± 0.05)\n2. y_actual = y * (1 ± 0.07)\n3. x >= 100\n4. y >= 100\n\nThe solution to this problem will give the optimal production quantities of type A and type B products that maximize the company's profit while accounting for the uncertainty in the production process."
