    "message_2": "To approximate the value of y at t = 0.2 using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.1, we will perform one iteration of the method. Let's denote the function y' = -2y + 4 as f(t, y). The initial values are t0 = 0 and y0 = 1.\n\n1. Calculate k1:\nk1 = h * f(t0, y0) = 0.1 * (-2 * 1 + 4) = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2\n\n2. Calculate k2:\nk2 = h * f(t0 + h/2, y0 + k1/2) = 0.1 * (-2 * (1 + 0.2/2) + 4) = 0.1 * (-2 * 1.1 + 4) = 0.1 * 1.8 = 0.18\n\n3. Calculate k3:\nk3 = h * f(t0 + h/2, y0 + k2/2) = 0.1 * (-2 * (1 + 0.18/2) + 4) = 0.1 * (-2 * 1.09 + 4) = 0.1 * 1.82 = 0.182\n\n4. Calculate k4:\nk4 = h * f(t0 + h, y0 + k3) = 0.1 * (-2 * (1 + 0.182) + 4) = 0.1 * (-2 * 1.182 + 4) = 0.1 * 1.636 = 0.1636\n\n5. Update y:\ny1 = y0 + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6 = 1 + (0.2 + 2 * 0.18 + 2 * 0.182 + 0.1636) / 6 = 1 + 0.1996 = 1.1996\n\nThus, the approximate value of y at t = 0.2 using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.1 is y1 = 1.1996."
