    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the key matrix.\n2. Use the key matrix to decrypt the encrypted message.\n\nStep 1: Determine the key matrix\nSince we know the plaintext \"MATHISFUN\" corresponds to the ciphertext \"VIUWTBZMVL\", we can use this information to find the key matrix. First, we need to break the plaintext and ciphertext into digraphs:\n\nPlaintext: MA TH IS FU N\nCiphertext: VI UW TB ZM VL\n\nNow, we need to find the key matrix. In a Playfair cipher, the key matrix is a 5x5 matrix containing the letters of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is combined with 'I') in a specific order. To find the key matrix, we need to analyze the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext digraphs.\n\nLet's take the first digraph pair: MA (plaintext) and VI (ciphertext). In a Playfair cipher, the letters in the digraph are replaced by the letters in the same row or column as the original letters, but with their positions swapped. So, M and A are in the same row or column as V and I, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, for the other digraph pairs:\n- T and H are in the same row or column as U and W, respectively.\n- I and S are in the same row or column as T and B, respectively.\n- F and U are in the same row or column as Z and M, respectively.\n- N is in the same row or column as L (since the last digraph has only one letter, we can assume it is in the same row or column as the last letter of the ciphertext).\n\nUsing this information, we can construct the key matrix:\n\n```\nM A V I L\nT H U W B\nF N Z S R\nE G K O P\nC D Q X Y\n```\n\nStep 2: Use the key matrix to decrypt the encrypted message\nNow that we have the key matrix, we can use it to decrypt the encrypted message \"FHLVHWRULF\". First, we need to break the encrypted message into digraphs:\n\nEncrypted message: FH LV HW RU LF\n\nNow, we can use the key matrix to decrypt each digraph:\n- F and H are in the same row or column as M and E, respectively.\n- L and V are in the same row or column as A and T, respectively.\n- H and W are in the same row or column as T and I, respectively.\n- R and U are in the same row or column as C and S, respectively.\n- L and F are in the same row or column as A and M, respectively.\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"METHATICS\"."
