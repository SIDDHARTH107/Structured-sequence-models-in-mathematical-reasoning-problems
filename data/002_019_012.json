    "message_2": "To find the surface area (excluding the base) of a right circular cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = π * radius * slant height\n\nIn this case, the radius is 5 cm and the slant height is 13 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface area = π * 5 * 13\n\nSurface area = 65π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone (excluding the base) is 65π cm²."
