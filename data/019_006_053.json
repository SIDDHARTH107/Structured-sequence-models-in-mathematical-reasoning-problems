    "message_1": "Sorry, but it's not possible to create a precise numerical problem for Deontic logic as it deals with norms, obligations and permissions and not with numerical calculations. Deontic logic requires formulating statements using modal operators such as \"ought to\" or \"should\" to establish norms and the relationships between them. Can I assist you with anything else?",
    "message_2": "Of course! If you have any other mathematical problems or questions related to a different topic, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help."
