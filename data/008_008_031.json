    "message_1": "Sure, here's a linear programming problem for the student to solve using matrix methods:\n\nA factory produces two products, product A and product B. It takes 3 hours to produce a unit of product A and 4 hours to produce a unit of product B. The factory has 400 hours of production time available each month. Product A sells for $5 per unit and product B sells for $8 per unit. The factory wants to maximize its profit. \n\nWrite the system of equations in matrix form and solve for the optimal production quantities of product A and product B, as well as the total profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The problem can be formulated as follows:\n\nMaximize profit: P = 5x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraint: 3x + 4y ≤ 400 (production time constraint)\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for this problem. The inequality can be rewritten as:\n\ny ≤ (400 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we can write the system of equations in matrix form:\n\nA = | 3  4 |, X = | x |, B = | 400 |\n                      | y |\n\nAX ≤ B\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. In this case, there are three vertices:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 0\n2. x = 0, y = 100 (when 3x = 0, y = (400 - 3x) / 4 = 100)\n3. x = 133.33, y = 0 (when 4y = 0, x = (400 - 4y) / 3 = 133.33)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P = 5x + 8y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 100) = 5(0) + 8(100) = 800\n3. P(133.33, 0) = 5(133.33) + 8(0) = 666.65\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (0, 100), where the profit is $800. Therefore, the factory should produce 0 units of product A and 100 units of product B to maximize its profit. The total profit will be $800."
