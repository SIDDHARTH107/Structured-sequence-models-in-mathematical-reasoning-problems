    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the related rates method. First, let's find the volume of the ice cream cone. The volume of a cone is given by the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nNow, we are given that the volume is decreasing at a rate of 2 cm³/min. So, dV/dt = -2 cm³/min.\n\nWe are asked to find the rate of change of the height (dh/dt) when the radius is 2 cm and the height is 3 cm.\n\nFirst, let's differentiate the volume formula with respect to time (t):\n\ndV/dt = d/dt[(1/3)πr²h]\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\ndV/dt = (1/3)π(2r(dr/dt)h + r²(dh/dt))\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and the known rate of change of the volume:\n\n-2 = (1/3)π(2(2)(dr/dt)(3) + (2)²(dh/dt))\n\n-2 = (1/3)π(12(dr/dt) + 4(dh/dt))\n\nNow, we need to find dr/dt when the radius is 2 cm and the height is 3 cm. To do this, we can use the formula for the volume of the cone and the given dimensions:\n\nV = (1/3)π(2)²(3)\n\nV = 12π cm³\n\nSince the volume is decreasing at a rate of 2 cm³/min, we can write:\n\ndV/dt = -2 = d/dt(12π)\n\nSince 12π is a constant, its derivative with respect to time is 0. So, we have:\n\n-2 = 0 + 4(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = -2/4 = -1/2\n\nSo, the rate of change of the height when the radius is 2 cm and the height is 3 cm is -1/2 cm/min."
