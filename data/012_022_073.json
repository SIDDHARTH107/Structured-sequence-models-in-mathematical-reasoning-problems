    "message_2": "The concept of Ramsey numbers helps us determine the minimum number of people needed to guarantee a certain pattern or relationship among them. In this case, we want to find the smallest number of people at a party such that there are either 3 people who all know each other or 3 people who are all strangers.\n\nThis is represented by the Ramsey number R(3, 3). The value of R(3, 3) is 6. This means that at a party with a minimum of 6 people, there will always be either a group of 3 people who all know each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers."
