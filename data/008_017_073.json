    "message_2": "First, let's write the given system of linear equations as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the solution vector [x, y, z], and B is the constant vector.\n\nA = | 3  2  1 |\n    | 2 -4  3 |\n    | 1  1 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 11  |\n    | -1  |\n    |  0  |\n\nNow, we will perform LU decomposition on matrix A. LU decomposition is the factorization of a given square matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nUsing Doolittle's method for LU decomposition, we get:\n\nL = | 1    0    0 |\n    | 2/3  1    0 |\n    | 1/3  1/2  1 |\n\nU = | 3  2    1   |\n    | 0 -8/3  1/3 |\n    | 0  0   -3/2 |\n\nNow, we will solve the system of linear equations using the LU decomposition. We will first solve the equation LY = B for Y, and then solve the equation UX = Y for X.\n\n1. Solving LY = B for Y:\n\nL = | 1    0    0 |       Y = | Y1 |       B = | 11  |\n    | 2/3  1    0 |           | Y2 |           | -1  |\n    | 1/3  1/2  1 |           | Y3 |           |  0  |\n\nFrom the first row, we get Y1 = 11.\nFrom the second row, we get (2/3)Y1 + Y2 = -1 => Y2 = -1 - (2/3)(11) = -9.\nFrom the third row, we get (1/3)Y1 + (1/2)Y2 + Y3 = 0 => Y3 = - (1/3)(11) - (1/2)(-9) = 1.\n\nSo, Y = | 11 |\n         | -9 |\n         |  1 |\n\n2. Solving UX = Y for X:\n\nU = | 3  2    1   |       X = | x |       Y = | 11  |\n    | 0 -8/3  1/3 |           | y |           | -9  |\n    | 0  0   -3/2 |           | z |           |  1  |\n\nFrom the third row, we get (-3/2)z = 1 => z = -2/3.\nFrom the second row, we get (-8/3)y + (1/3)z = -9 => y = -3.\nFrom the first row, we get 3x + 2y + z = 11 => x = 2.\n\nSo, the solution vector X is:\n\nX = |  2  |\n    | -3  |\n    | -2/3|\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 2, y = -3, and z = -2/3."
