    "message_2": "To find the value of x in radians using the inverse trigonometric function, we can use the arcsin function, which is the inverse of the sin function. \n\nx = arcsin(0.5)\n\nUsing a calculator or a reference table, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 0.5236 radians (30 degrees)\n\nHowever, the sine function is periodic with a period of 2π, so there is another solution within the range of 0 to 2π:\n\nx = π - 0.5236 ≈ 2.6179 radians (150 degrees)\n\nSo, the two values of x in radians are approximately 0.5236 and 2.6179."
