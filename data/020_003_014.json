    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit from each A product is $5 and the profit from each B product is $10. The company has a maximum of 400 hours of labor available and each A product requires 2 hours of labor while each B product requires 4 hours of labor. What is the maximum profit the company can generate per day? \n\nTo solve this problem, the student will need to use convex optimization techniques to optimize the company's production schedule and determine the optimal quantity of A and B products to produce given the constraints on labor hours.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of A products and y be the number of B products produced per day. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 5x + 10y\n\nThe constraint on labor hours can be represented as:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 400\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we can first solve the constraint equation for y:\n\ny ≤ (400 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ 100 - 0.5x\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by setting the partial derivatives of the profit function with respect to x and y equal to zero:\n\n∂(Profit)/∂x = 5 - 0 = 5\n∂(Profit)/∂y = 10 - 0 = 10\n\nSince both partial derivatives are non-zero, there is no interior critical point. Therefore, the maximum profit must occur on the boundary of the feasible region. We can check the endpoints of the feasible region:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 100: Profit = 5(0) + 10(100) = $1000\n2. x = 200, y = 0: Profit = 5(200) + 10(0) = $1000\n3. x = 200, y = 100: Not feasible as it violates the labor constraint.\n\nSince both endpoints (x=0, y=100) and (x=200, y=0) yield the same maximum profit of $1000, the company can choose either to produce 100 B products or 200 A products per day to achieve the maximum profit of $1000."
