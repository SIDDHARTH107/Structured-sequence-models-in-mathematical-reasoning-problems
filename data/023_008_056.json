    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients, we first need to determine if the function is even, odd, or neither. In this case, f(x) = x^2 - 2x is neither even nor odd. Therefore, we will use the general Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken over all positive integers n.\n\nIn this case, L = (4 - 0)/2 = 2. Now, let's find the coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0.\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)]dx from 0 to 2L\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to 2L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to 2L\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 - 2x)]dx from 0 to 4\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1/3)x^3 - x^2] from 0 to 4\na_0 = (1/2) * [(64/3 - 16) - (0)]\na_0 = (1/2) * (64/3 - 48/3)\na_0 = (1/2) * (16/3)\na_0 = 8/3\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 - 2x) * cos(nπx/2)]dx from 0 to 4\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let u = x^2 - 2x and dv = cos(nπx/2)dx. Then, du = (2x - 2)dx and v = (2/nπ)sin(nπx/2).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(uv)|_0^4 - ∫(vdu)] from 0 to 4\na_n = (1/2) * [((2/nπ)(x^2 - 2x)sin(nπx/2))|_0^4 - ∫((2/nπ)(2x - 2)sin(nπx/2)dx)] from 0 to 4\n\nNow, let u = 2x - 2 and dv = (2/nπ)sin(nπx/2)dx. Then, du = 2dx and v = (-4/n^2π^2)cos(nπx/2).\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [((2/nπ)(x^2 - 2x)sin(nπx/2))|_0^4 - ((-4/n^2π^2)(2x - 2)cos(nπx/2))|_0^4 + ∫((-4/n^2π^2)(2)cos(nπx/2)dx)] from 0 to 4\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining term:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [((2/nπ)(x^2 - 2x)sin(nπx/2))|_0^4 - ((-4/n^2π^2)(2x - 2)cos(nπx/2))|_0^4 + ((-8/n^3π^3)sin(nπx/2))|_0^4]\n\nEvaluating the terms at the limits:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [0 - 0 + 0 - ((-4/n^2π^2)(8)cos(2nπ)) + ((-8/n^3π^3)sin(2nπ)) - 0]\na_n = (1/2) * [32/n^2π^2] for n even\na_n = 0 for n odd\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 - 2x) * sin(nπx/2)]dx from 0 to 4\n\nUsing the same integration by parts method as before:\n\nb_n = (1/2) * [((2/nπ)(x^2 - 2x)cos(nπx/2))|_0^4 - ((-4/n^2π^2)(2x - 2)sin(nπx/2))|_0^4 + ((-8/n^3π^3)cos(nπx/2))|_0^4]\n\nEvaluating the terms at the limits:\n\nb_n = (1/2) * [0 - 0 + ((-8/n^3π^3)cos(2nπ)) - 0]\nb_n = (-4/n^3π^3) for n even\nb_n = 0 for n odd\n\nNow, we have the Fourier coefficients for the first three non-zero terms:\n\na_0 = 8/3\na_2 = 32/(4π^2)\nb_2 = -4/(8π^3)\n\nSo, the first three non-zero terms of the Fourier series are:\n\nf(x) ≈ (8/3)/2 + (32/(4π^2))cos(2πx/2) - (4/(8π^3))sin(2πx/2)"
