    "message_2": "To find the prime factorization of 1021 using Pollard's rho algorithm with the given function f(x) = x^2 + 1 and initial value x0 = 2, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize two variables x and y with the initial value x0 = 2.\n2. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n   a. Update x and y using the function f(x) and taking the result modulo 1021.\n      x = f(x) mod 1021\n      y = f(f(y)) mod 1021\n   b. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y, and the number 1021.\n      d = GCD(|x - y|, 1021)\n   c. If d is not 1 and not 1021, it is a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = (2^2 + 1) mod 1021 = 5\ny = f(f(2)) mod 1021 = f(5) mod 1021 = (5^2 + 1) mod 1021 = 26\nd = GCD(|5 - 26|, 1021) = GCD(21, 1021) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = (5^2 + 1) mod 1021 = 26\ny = f(f(26)) mod 1021 = f(677) mod 1021 = (677^2 + 1) mod 1021 = 346\nd = GCD(|26 - 346|, 1021) = GCD(320, 1021) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = (26^2 + 1) mod 1021 = 677\ny = f(f(346)) mod 1021 = f(841) mod 1021 = (841^2 + 1) mod 1021 = 677\nd = GCD(|677 - 677|, 1021) = GCD(0, 1021) = 1021\n\nIteration 4:\nx = (677^2 + 1) mod 1021 = 346\ny = f(f(677)) mod 1021 = f(346) mod 1021 = (346^2 + 1) mod 1021 = 841\nd = GCD(|346 - 841|, 1021) = GCD(495, 1021) = 13\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, d = 13. Now we can divide 1021 by 13 to find the other factor:\n\n1021 / 13 = 79\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 1021 is 13 * 79."
