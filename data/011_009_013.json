    "message_2": "To partition a set of n distinct elements into non-empty subsets, we use the Bell number, which is denoted as B(n). The Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle or other methods, but for small values like n = 7, it's easier to look up the value.\n\nThe Bell number for n = 7 is B(7) = 877.\n\nSo, there are 877 ways to partition a set of 7 distinct elements into non-empty subsets."
