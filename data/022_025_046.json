    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for the given potential V(x) = kx^2 - 3x, we first write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n-ħ^2 / (2m) * (d^2ψ/dx^2) + (kx^2 - 3x)ψ = Eψ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, E is the energy eigenvalue, and ψ is the wave function. The boundary conditions are ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(1) = 0.\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, which does not have an analytical solution for arbitrary k. However, we can still find the first three energy eigenvalues and their corresponding normalized eigenfunctions using numerical methods, such as the shooting method or the finite difference method.\n\nHere, we will outline the shooting method:\n\n1. Choose an initial guess for the energy eigenvalue E.\n2. Solve the Schrödinger equation numerically using the initial conditions ψ(0) = 0 and dψ/dx(0) = 1 (since ψ'(0) is arbitrary, we can choose any non-zero value).\n3. Check if the boundary condition ψ(1) = 0 is satisfied. If not, adjust the energy eigenvalue E and repeat steps 2-3 until the boundary condition is satisfied within a desired level of accuracy.\n4. Normalize the eigenfunction ψ(x) by ensuring that the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 from 0 to 1 is equal to 1.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the next two energy eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions.\n\nBy following this method, we can find the first three energy eigenvalues E1, E2, and E3, and their corresponding normalized eigenfunctions ψ1(x), ψ2(x), and ψ3(x). Note that the actual values will depend on the choice of k and the mass m of the particle."
