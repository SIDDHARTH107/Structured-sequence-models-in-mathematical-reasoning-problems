    "message_2": "The dimension of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus g (M_g) can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3\n\nIn the case of genus g = 2, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\ndim(M_2) = 3(2) - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3\n\nSo, the dimension of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 2 is 3."
