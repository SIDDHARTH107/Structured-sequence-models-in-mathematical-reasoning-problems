If there exist a section of f, i.e., a morphism s: Y -> X satisfying f ∘ s = id_Y, prove that the base Y is birational to a projective space. Determine the dimension of Y and the degree of the birational map.",
    "message_2": "Since X is a projective algebraic variety with dimension 3 and Picard number 1, we know that the Néron-Severi group of X is generated by the anti-canonical divisor -K_X. Moreover, since -K_X is ample, X is a Fano variety.\n\nNow, let f: X -> Y be a Mori fiber space, which means that f is a projective morphism with connected fibers, and the relative Picard number of f is 1. Since there exists a section s: Y -> X such that f ∘ s = id_Y, we have that the fibers of f are of dimension 0 or 1.\n\nWe claim that the fibers of f must be of dimension 1. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a fiber F of dimension 0. Then F is a point, and since the relative Picard number of f is 1, we have that the restriction of -K_X to F is ample. But this is a contradiction, as the restriction of an ample divisor to a point cannot be ample.\n\nThus, the fibers of f are of dimension 1, and since X has dimension 3, the base Y must have dimension 2. Now, consider the pushforward of the anti-canonical divisor f_*(-K_X). Since the fibers of f are of dimension 1, we have that f_*(-K_X) is a line bundle on Y. Moreover, since -K_X is ample, f_*(-K_X) is also ample.\n\nNow, we have that the Néron-Severi group of Y is generated by the ample line bundle f_*(-K_X), and hence Y has Picard number 1. Since Y is a projective variety of dimension 2 with Picard number 1, it is birational to a projective space, say P^2.\n\nTo determine the degree of the birational map, we can compute the self-intersection number of f_*(-K_X) on Y. Since -K_X is ample and generates the Néron-Severi group of X, we have that (-K_X)^3 > 0. Now, using the projection formula, we get:\n\n(-K_X)^3 = (f^*f_*(-K_X))^3 = deg(f) (f_*(-K_X))^2,\n\nwhere deg(f) is the degree of the birational map. Since (-K_X)^3 > 0 and (f_*(-K_X))^2 > 0, we have that deg(f) > 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the base Y is birational to a projective space P^2, the dimension of Y is 2, and the degree of the birational map is positive."
