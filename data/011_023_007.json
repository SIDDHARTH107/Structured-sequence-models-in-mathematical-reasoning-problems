    "message_1": "A graph has 10 vertices. Each vertex can be colored with one of three different colors. In how many ways can the vertices be colored, given that no two adjacent vertices can have the same color?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the chromatic polynomial. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a graph G is a polynomial in the variable k that counts the number of k-colorings of G, i.e., the number of ways to color the vertices of G with k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nHowever, since the problem does not provide any information about the edges or the structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the chromatic polynomial and thus the number of ways to color the vertices with the given constraint."
