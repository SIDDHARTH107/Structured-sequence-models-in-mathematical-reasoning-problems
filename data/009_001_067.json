Write a differential equation to model the city's population growth and use it to predict the population after 10 years.",
    "message_2": "To model the city's population growth, we can use the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, and k is the proportionality constant.\n\nGiven the proportionality constant k = 0.02, the differential equation becomes:\n\ndP/dt = 0.02P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.02 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.02 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.02t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 50,000:\n\nln(50,000) = 0.02(0) + C\nC = ln(50,000)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in terms of P:\n\nP(t) = e^(0.02t + ln(50,000))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nP(t) = e^(0.02t) * e^(ln(50,000))\nP(t) = 50,000 * e^(0.02t)\n\nTo predict the population after 10 years, plug t = 10 into the equation:\n\nP(10) = 50,000 * e^(0.02 * 10)\nP(10) = 50,000 * e^0.2\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(10) ≈ 50,000 * 1.2214\nP(10) ≈ 61,070\n\nSo, the predicted population of the city after 10 years is approximately 61,070."
