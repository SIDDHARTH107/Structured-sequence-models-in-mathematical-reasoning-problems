    "message_2": "To calculate the Christoffel symbols for the given metric, we first need to find the metric tensor components, which are the coefficients of the metric. In this case, the metric tensor components are:\n\n$$ g_{tt} = -4, \\ g_{xx} = 2, \\ g_{yy} = 2, \\ g_{zz} = 2 $$\n\nAll other components are zero since the metric is diagonal.\n\nNow, we can calculate the inverse metric tensor components, denoted by $g^{ij}$:\n\n$$ g^{tt} = -\\frac{1}{4}, \\ g^{xx} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\ g^{yy} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\ g^{zz} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nAgain, all other components are zero.\n\nNext, we will calculate the Christoffel symbols using the following formula:\n\n$$ \\Gamma^i_{jk} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{il} (\\partial_j g_{lk} + \\partial_k g_{lj} - \\partial_l g_{jk}) $$\n\nSince the metric tensor components are constants, their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate are zero:\n\n$$ \\partial_j g_{lk} = \\partial_k g_{lj} = \\partial_l g_{jk} = 0 $$\n\nThus, all the Christoffel symbols for this metric are zero:\n\n$$ \\Gamma^i_{jk} = 0 $$\n\nSo, at the point (1, 1), all the Christoffel symbols are zero."
