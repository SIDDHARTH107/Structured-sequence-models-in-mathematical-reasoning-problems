    "message_2": "To find the limit of f(x) as x approaches -1, we first need to check if the function is continuous at x = -1. If the function is continuous, we can simply substitute -1 into the function to find the limit. However, if the function is not continuous, we need to find another way to determine the limit.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the denominator of the function becomes 0 when x = -1, which means the function is not continuous at x = -1. Therefore, we need to find another way to determine the limit.\n\nOne way to do this is to simplify the function by factoring the numerator and canceling out any common factors with the denominator. Let's do this for f(x):\n\nf(x) = (2x² + 3x - 2) / (x + 1)\n\nFirst, we need to factor the numerator:\n\n2x² + 3x - 2 = (2x - 1)(x + 2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = (2x - 1)(x + 2) / (x + 1)\n\nSince there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator, we cannot simplify the function any further. However, we can still find the limit by considering the behavior of the function as x approaches -1.\n\nAs x approaches -1, the factors (2x - 1) and (x + 2) in the numerator approach -3 and 1, respectively. The factor (x + 1) in the denominator approaches 0. Therefore, the function f(x) approaches (-3 * 1) / 0, which is undefined.\n\nThus, the limit of f(x) as x approaches -1 does not exist."
