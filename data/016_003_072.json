    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, and its boundary is infinitely complex. The area of the Mandelbrot set itself is not known exactly, but it is known to be less than 2. The Mandelbrot set is connected and contains a large \"cardioid\" shape in the center, surrounded by a \"circle\" of smaller copies of the set.\n\nSince the question asks for the largest exact copy of the Mandelbrot set contained within a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin, we can consider the main cardioid and its surrounding circle. The largest exact copy of the Mandelbrot set that can be contained within the circle of radius 3 is the Mandelbrot set itself.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the exact area of the Mandelbrot set is not known, but it is known to be less than 2. Therefore, the area of the largest exact copy of the Mandelbrot set contained within the circle of radius 3 centered at the origin of the complex plane is less than 2."
