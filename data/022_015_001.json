Given that $f(0)=a$, and $f(a)=b$, where $a, b$ are complex numbers, find the value of $f(\\bar{a})$, where $\\bar{a}$ denotes the complex conjugate of $a$. Use the Schwarz reflection principle and its applications to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is an entire function and $|f(z)| \\leq 1$ for $|z| \\leq 1$, we can apply the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic in a bounded domain and continuous up to the boundary, then the maximum of the modulus of the function occurs on the boundary. In this case, the maximum of $|f(z)|$ occurs on the boundary of the unit disk, i.e., $|z| = 1$. \n\nNow, consider the function $g(z) = f(z)f(1-z)$. This function is also entire, and we have:\n\n1. $|g(z)| \\leq 1$ for $|z| \\leq 1$ since $|f(z)| \\leq 1$ and $|f(1-z)| \\leq 1$.\n2. $g(0) = f(0)f(1) = af(1)$.\n3. $g(1) = f(1)f(0) = f(1)a$.\n\nApplying the Maximum Modulus Principle to $g(z)$, we find that the maximum of $|g(z)|$ occurs on the boundary of the unit disk. However, since $|g(z)| \\leq 1$ for $|z| \\leq 1$, it follows that $|g(z)| = 1$ for $|z| = 1$. Therefore, $|af(1)| = 1$ and $|f(1)a| = 1$. Since $a \\neq 0$, we have $|f(1)| = \\frac{1}{|a|}$.\n\nNow, consider the function $h(z) = \\frac{f(z)}{f(1-z)}$. This function is also entire, and we have:\n\n1. $|h(z)| = 1$ for $|z| \\leq 1$ since $|f(z)| \\leq 1$ and $|f(1-z)| \\leq 1$.\n2. $h(0) = \\frac{f(0)}{f(1)} = \\frac{a}{f(1)}$.\n3. $h(1) = \\frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = \\frac{f(1)}{a}$.\n\nApplying the Schwarz Reflection Principle to $h(z)$, we find that $h(z) = \\frac{1}{\\overline{h(1-z)}}$ for $|z| \\leq 1$. In particular, we have:\n\n$$h(a) = \\frac{1}{\\overline{h(1-a)}} \\implies f(a) = \\frac{f(1-a)}{\\overline{f(a)}} \\implies b = \\frac{f(1-a)}{\\overline{a}}.$$\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $f(\\overline{a})$. We have:\n\n$$f(\\overline{a}) = \\frac{f(1-\\overline{a})}{\\overline{\\overline{a}}} = \\frac{f(1-\\overline{a})}{a}.$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is entire, it is also continuous, and we have $f(1-\\overline{a}) = \\overline{f(1-a)}$. Therefore,\n\n$$f(\\overline{a}) = \\frac{\\overline{f(1-a)}}{a} = \\overline{\\frac{f(1-a)}{\\overline{a}}} = \\overline{b}.$$"
