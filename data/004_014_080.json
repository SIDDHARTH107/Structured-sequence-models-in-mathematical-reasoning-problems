    "message_2": "To find the volume of water in the hemispherical bowl, we can use integration. We will integrate the area of the circular cross-sections of the water along the depth of the bowl.\n\nLet's consider a small circular cross-section of the water at a depth x from the top of the bowl. The radius of this cross-section is r. Since the bowl is hemispherical, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate r, x, and the radius of the bowl (5 cm):\n\nr^2 + x^2 = 5^2\nr^2 = 5^2 - x^2\nr = √(25 - x^2)\n\nThe area of the circular cross-section is given by:\n\nA(x) = πr^2 = π(25 - x^2)\n\nNow, we will integrate this area along the depth of the water, from the top of the water (x = 0) to the bottom of the water (x = 3 cm):\n\nV = ∫[A(x) dx] from 0 to 3\nV = ∫[π(25 - x^2) dx] from 0 to 3\n\nTo integrate, we can use the power rule:\n\nV = π∫(25 - x^2) dx = π[25x - (x^3)/3] from 0 to 3\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = π[25(3) - (3^3)/3] - π[25(0) - (0^3)/3]\nV = π[75 - 27] = π[48]\n\nSo, the total volume of water in the bowl is 48π cubic centimeters."
