    "message_2": "To find the lowest non-trivial factor of the number 221 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is the number we want to factor (in this case, n = 221).\n\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y. We can start with x = y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the function for both x and y, with y iterating twice as fast as x. This means we will apply the function twice for y in each step. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y and the number n.\n\n4. If the GCD is not 1 or n, we have found a non-trivial factor. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is n, choose a different function or initial values and try again.\n\nLet's start the iteration:\n\ni = 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 221 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 221 = 26\nGCD(|x - y|, n) = GCD(|5 - 26|, 221) = GCD(21, 221) = 1\n\ni = 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 221 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(82) = (82^2 + 1) mod 221 = 135\nGCD(|x - y|, n) = GCD(|26 - 135|, 221) = GCD(109, 221) = 1\n\ni = 3:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) mod 221 = 82\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(135)) = f(197) = (197^2 + 1) mod 221 = 5\nGCD(|x - y|, n) = GCD(|82 - 5|, 221) = GCD(77, 221) = 13\n\nThe GCD is 13, which is a non-trivial factor of 221. So, the lowest non-trivial factor of 221 is 13."
