    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the product fg'(x), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In this case, we have:\n\n(fg'(x))' = f'(x)g'(x) + f(x)g''(x)\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g'(x):\n\nf(x) = x^2ln(x)\nf'(x) = d(x^2ln(x))/dx = 2xln(x) + x^2(1/x) = 2xln(x) + x\n\ng(x) = e^x\ng'(x) = d(e^x)/dx = e^x\ng''(x) = d(e^x)/dx = e^x\n\nNow, we can plug these derivatives into the product rule formula:\n\n(fg'(x))' = f'(x)g'(x) + f(x)g''(x)\n          = (2xln(x) + x)(e^x) + (x^2ln(x))(e^x)\n          = 2xln(x)e^x + xe^x + x^2ln(x)e^x\n\nSo, the derivative of the product fg'(x) is:\n\n(fg'(x))' = 2xln(x)e^x + xe^x + x^2ln(x)e^x"
