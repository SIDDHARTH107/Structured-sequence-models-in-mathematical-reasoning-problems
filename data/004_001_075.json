    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 5, we need to differentiate it with respect to x.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2 - 2x + 5)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 2\n\nf'(2) = 12 - 2\n\nf'(2) = 10\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 5 at x = 2 is 10."
