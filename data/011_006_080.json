    "message_1": "A student has a collection of 7 identical pens, 6 identical pencils, and 4 identical erasers. In how many ways can the student select a set of writing materials if they can choose up to 5 items?",
    "message_2": "We will use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. Let's represent the pens as P, pencils as C, and erasers as E. We will consider each case separately, where the student selects 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 items.\n\nCase 1: Selecting 1 item\nThere are 3 possibilities: 1 pen, 1 pencil, or 1 eraser.\n\nCase 2: Selecting 2 items\nThere are 6 possibilities: PP, PC, PE, CC, CE, EE.\n\nCase 3: Selecting 3 items\nThere are 10 possibilities: PPP, PPC, PPE, PCC, PCE, PEE, CCC, CCE, CEE, EEE.\n\nCase 4: Selecting 4 items\nThere are 11 possibilities: PPPP, PPPC, PPPE, PPCC, PPCE, PPEE, PCCC, PCCE, PCEE, CCCC, CCCE.\n\nCase 5: Selecting 5 items\nThere are 10 possibilities: PPPPP, PPPPC, PPPPE, PPPCC, PPPCE, PPPEE, PPCCC, PPCCCE, PCCCC, PCCCE.\n\nNow, we add up the possibilities for each case: 3 + 6 + 10 + 11 + 10 = 40.\n\nSo, there are 40 ways for the student to select a set of writing materials with up to 5 items."
