    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the exact surface area of the cylinder?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area (the area of the side). \n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius of the cylinder is 5 cm, the area of one circular base is:\n\nA = π(5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n\n2 × 25π cm² = 50π cm²\n\nNow, we need to find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is the area of the rectangle that wraps around the side of the cylinder. The height of this rectangle is the same as the height of the cylinder, and the width is the circumference of the circular base. The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. So, the circumference of the base is:\n\nC = 2π(5 cm) = 10π cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area by multiplying the height of the cylinder by the circumference of the base:\n\nLateral Surface Area = Height × Circumference = 12 cm × 10π cm = 120π cm²\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area of the cylinder by adding the area of the bases and the lateral surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = Area of Bases + Lateral Surface Area = 50π cm² + 120π cm² = 170π cm²\n\nSo, the exact surface area of the cylinder is 170π cm²."
