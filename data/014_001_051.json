    "message_2": "To determine the modulus (n), phi(n), the public key (e), and the private key (d) for RSA encryption, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the modulus (n):\nn = p * q\nn = 17 * 11\nn = 187\n\n2. Calculate the totient (phi(n)):\nphi(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\nphi(n) = (17 - 1) * (11 - 1)\nphi(n) = 16 * 10\nphi(n) = 160\n\n3. Choose a public key (e) such that 1 < e < phi(n) and e is coprime to phi(n). A common choice for e is 3 or 65537. In this case, we can choose e = 3 since it is coprime to 160.\n\ne = 3\n\n4. Calculate the private key (d) such that (d * e) % phi(n) = 1. In other words, find the modular inverse of e (mod phi(n)).\n\nTo find d, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\ne * d ≡ 1 (mod phi(n))\n\n3 * d ≡ 1 (mod 160)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 107.\n\nd = 107\n\nSo, the modulus (n) is 187, phi(n) is 160, the public key (e) is 3, and the private key (d) is 107."
