    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  4 |\n    | 2 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 18 |\n    | -3 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant(A) = (3 * -5) - (4 * 2) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/Determinant(A)) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the signs of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdjoint(A) = | -5 -4 |\n             | -2  3 |\n\nNow, multiply the adjoint of A by the reciprocal of the determinant:\n\nA^(-1) = (-1/-23) * | -5 -4 |\n                    | -2  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/23) * | -5 -4 |\n                 | -2  3 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = (1/23) * | -5 -4 | * | 18 |\n             | -2  3 |   | -3 |\n\nMultiply the matrices:\n\nX = (1/23) * | (-5 * 18) + (-4 * -3) |\n             | (-2 * 18) + (3 * -3)  |\n\nX = (1/23) * | -90 + 12 |\n             | -36 - 9   |\n\nX = (1/23) * | -78 |\n             | -45  |\n\nNow, multiply each element by the scalar (1/23):\n\nX = | (-78/23) |\n    | (-45/23) |\n\nX = | 3.3913 |\n    | 1.9565 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are approximately x ≈ 3.3913 and y ≈ 1.9565."
