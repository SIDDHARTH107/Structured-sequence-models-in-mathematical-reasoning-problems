    "message_2": "Let's denote the person's elevation as h(t) in meters, where t is the time in minutes. Since the Ferris wheel completes one revolution in 4 minutes, the angular speed (ω) can be calculated as:\n\nω = 2π / 4 = π/2 radians per minute\n\nThe radius of the Ferris wheel is half of the diameter, so r = 50/2 = 25 meters.\n\nWe can model the person's elevation as a sinusoidal function, with the maximum elevation being the diameter of the Ferris wheel (50 meters) and the minimum elevation being ground level (0 meters). The amplitude of the function will be equal to the radius (25 meters), and the vertical shift will be equal to the radius as well (since the center of the wheel is at ground level).\n\nThe equation for the person's elevation can be written as:\n\nh(t) = A * sin(ωt + φ) + B\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω is the angular speed, t is the time, φ is the phase shift, and B is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, A = 25 meters, ω = π/2 radians per minute, and B = 25 meters. Since the person starts at the bottom of the Ferris wheel, we need to shift the sine function by π/2 radians to the right. Therefore, φ = -π/2.\n\nNow we can write the equation for the person's elevation as:\n\nh(t) = 25 * sin((π/2)t - π/2) + 25"
