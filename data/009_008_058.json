    "message_2": "To find the displacement of the particle at x = 1/8 meters and t = 0, we can plug these values into the given equation:\n\ny(x,t) = (0.05 m) sin(4πx - 2πt)\n\ny(1/8, 0) = (0.05 m) sin(4π(1/8) - 2π(0))\n\ny(1/8, 0) = (0.05 m) sin(π/2)\n\nSince sin(π/2) = 1, the displacement of the particle is:\n\ny(1/8, 0) = (0.05 m)(1) = 0.05 m"
