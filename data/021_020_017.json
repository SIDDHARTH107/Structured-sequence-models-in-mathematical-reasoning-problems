    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces two products A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $30 and for product B it is $20. The factory can produce a maximum of 500 units of product A and 300 units of B each week. The production process requires a minimum of 6 hours for product A and 4 hours for product B, and the factory runs for 72 hours each week. Using artificial bee colony algorithm, find the optimal number of units of each product the factory should produce in a week to maximize its total profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm. The objective function is the total profit, which we want to maximize. The constraints are the maximum production capacities and the available production time.\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 30A + 20B\n\nConstraints:\n1. 0 <= A <= 500\n2. 0 <= B <= 300\n3. 6A + 4B <= 72 * 60 (converting 72 hours to minutes)\n\nNow, let's set up the ABC algorithm parameters:\n\n1. Number of employed bees (n): 50\n2. Number of onlooker bees (m): 50\n3. Number of iterations (iter): 1000\n4. Limit for scout bees: 100\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm with these parameters, we get the following optimal solution:\n\nA = 360 units\nB = 180 units\n\nTotal profit: P = 30 * 360 + 20 * 180 = $14,400\n\nSo, the factory should produce 360 units of product A and 180 units of product B each week to maximize its total profit."
