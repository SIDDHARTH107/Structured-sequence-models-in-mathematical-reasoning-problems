    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = cos(2x) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y = cos(2x):\n\ndy/dx = d(cos(2x))/dx = -sin(2x) * d(2x)/dx = -sin(2x) * 2 = -2sin(2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx = -2sin(2(π/4)) = -2sin(π/2) = -2(1) = -2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = cos(2x) at x = π/4 is -2."
