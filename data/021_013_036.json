    "message_2": "Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is used to find the global minimum of a function, especially when the function has many local minima. The algorithm involves generating random solutions and accepting them based on a probability function that depends on the current temperature and the difference in the objective function values.\n\nTo apply the simulated annealing method to find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 in the range [0, 5], we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the temperature T and the cooling rate α.\n2. Choose an initial solution x0 in the range [0, 5].\n3. Repeat the following steps until the stopping criterion is met:\n   a. Generate a random neighbor solution x' in the range [0, 5].\n   b. Calculate the difference in the objective function values: Δf = f(x') - f(x0).\n   c. If Δf < 0, accept the new solution x' as the current solution x0.\n   d. If Δf ≥ 0, accept the new solution x' as the current solution x0 with probability exp(-Δf/T).\n   e. Update the temperature: T = α * T.\n\nSince the simulated annealing method is a stochastic algorithm, the results may vary depending on the random choices made during the process. To obtain a more accurate result, you can run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best solution found.\n\nNote that the simulated annealing method is more suitable for complex optimization problems with many local minima. For the given quadratic function, you can easily find the global minimum using calculus or the vertex formula for parabolas."
