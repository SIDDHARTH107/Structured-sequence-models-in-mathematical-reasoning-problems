    "message_2": "To forecast the number of daily website visitors for the next 7 days, we can observe the pattern in the given time series data. The data shows a linear increase in the number of visitors, with an increase of 15 visitors each day.\n\nUsing this pattern, we can forecast the number of daily website visitors for the next 7 days as follows:\n\nDay 8: 290 + 15 = 305\nDay 9: 305 + 15 = 320\nDay 10: 320 + 15 = 335\nDay 11: 335 + 15 = 350\nDay 12: 350 + 15 = 365\nDay 13: 365 + 15 = 380\nDay 14: 380 + 15 = 395\n\nSo, the forecasted values for the number of daily website visitors for the next 7 days are 305, 320, 335, 350, 365, 380, and 395."
