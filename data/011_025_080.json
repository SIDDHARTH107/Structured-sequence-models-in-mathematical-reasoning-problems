    "message_2": "Let's use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We will create an array dp[n+1] where dp[i] represents the number of different possible outcomes when there are i stones left in the pile. We will fill this array iteratively.\n\nBase cases:\n- dp[0] = 1 (only one way to remove 0 stones, by not taking any action)\n- dp[1] = 1 (only one way to remove 1 stone, by taking 1 stone)\n- dp[2] = 2 (two ways to remove 2 stones: take 1 stone twice or take 2 stones at once)\n- dp[3] = 4 (four ways to remove 3 stones: take 1 stone three times, take 1 stone and then 2 stones, take 2 stones and then 1 stone, or take 3 stones at once)\n\nNow, we can fill the rest of the array using the following recurrence relation:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] for i > 3\n\nThis is because, for any i stones, a player can either take 1, 2, or 3 stones, and the remaining stones will be i-1, i-2, or i-3, respectively. The number of ways to remove i stones will be the sum of the number of ways to remove i-1, i-2, and i-3 stones.\n\nNow, we can fill the dp array for i = 4 to 20 and find the value of dp[20].\n\nHere's the code to calculate dp[20]:\n\n```python\ndef count_outcomes(n):\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    dp[1] = 1\n    dp[2] = 2\n    dp[3] = 4\n\n    for i in range(4, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3]\n\n    return dp[n]\n\nprint(count_outcomes(20))\n```\n\nThe output of this code is 121415, which means there are 121415 different possible outcomes for this game when there are 20 stones in the pile."
