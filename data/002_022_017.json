    "message_1": "What is the volume of a torus with a major radius of 5 cm and a minor radius of 2 cm?",
    "message_2": "The volume V of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (π * r^2) * (2 * π * R)\n\nwhere r is the minor radius and R is the major radius.\n\nIn this case, r = 2 cm and R = 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (π * (2^2)) * (2 * π * 5)\nV = (π * 4) * (10 * π)\nV = 40 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is 40π^2 cubic centimeters, or approximately 1256.64 cubic centimeters."
