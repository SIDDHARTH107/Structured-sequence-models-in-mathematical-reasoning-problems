You want to cut out a square from each corner of the paper and fold up the resulting tabs to make a box without a lid. What is the largest possible volume of the box? \n\n(Note: The box should have a height that is equal to the side length of the square cutouts, and the paper should be folded to form a rectangular base for the box.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cutouts. After cutting out the squares and folding up the tabs, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\n- Length: 12 - 2x\n- Width: 8 - 2x\n- Height: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as a function of x:\n\nV(x) = x(12 - 2x)(8 - 2x)\n\nTo find the largest possible volume, we need to find the maximum value of V(x). We can do this by taking the derivative of V(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndV/dx = (12 - 2x)(8 - 2x) - 2x(8 - 2x) - 2x(12 - 2x) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\n-8x^3 + 40x^2 - 64x = 0\n\nFactoring out -8x:\n\n-8x(x^2 - 5x + 8) = 0\n\nNow we can find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 8:\n\nx = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4 * 8)) / 2\nx = (5 ± √9) / 2\nx = 2 or x = 4\n\nSince the width of the paper is 8cm, we cannot cut out squares with a side length of 4cm, as that would leave no paper to fold up. Therefore, the optimal side length of the square cutouts is 2cm.\n\nNow we can find the dimensions of the box:\n\n- Length: 12 - 2(2) = 8cm\n- Width: 8 - 2(2) = 4cm\n- Height: 2cm\n\nThe largest possible volume of the box is:\n\nV = 8 * 4 * 2 = 64 cubic centimeters."
