    "message_1": "A CEO wants to hire a manager to run a new project. The CEO has two options: hire a highly skilled manager for a salary of $200,000 or hire a less skilled manager for a salary of $100,000. The quality of the manager's work is measured by a performance parameter (P), which can have a high value (H) or a low value (L). If the CEO hires the highly skilled manager, the probability of getting a high performance is 0.6, and the probability of getting a low performance is 0.4. If the CEO hires the less skilled manager, the probability of getting a high performance is 0.3, and the probability of getting a low performance is 0.7. \n\nThe CEO can also choose to offer a performance-based compensation to the manager. If the manager achieves a high performance (P=H), they will be paid a bonus of $150,000. If the manager achieves a low performance (P=L), they will not receive any bonus.\n\nWhat is the optimal compensation plan for the CEO to offer to the manager in order to maximize the expected performance of the project?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal compensation plan, we need to calculate the expected performance for each option and compare them. We will calculate the expected performance for each manager with and without the performance-based bonus.\n\n1. Highly skilled manager without bonus:\nExpected performance = (0.6 * H) + (0.4 * L)\n\n2. Highly skilled manager with bonus:\nExpected performance = (0.6 * (H + $150,000)) + (0.4 * L)\n\n3. Less skilled manager without bonus:\nExpected performance = (0.3 * H) + (0.7 * L)\n\n4. Less skilled manager with bonus:\nExpected performance = (0.3 * (H + $150,000)) + (0.7 * L)\n\nNow, we need to compare the expected performance of each option. Since we don't have the actual values for H and L, we can't calculate the exact expected performance. However, we can compare the options by analyzing the impact of the bonus on the expected performance.\n\nFor the highly skilled manager, the bonus increases the expected performance by 0.6 * $150,000 = $90,000. For the less skilled manager, the bonus increases the expected performance by 0.3 * $150,000 = $45,000.\n\nSince the bonus has a greater impact on the expected performance for the highly skilled manager, the optimal compensation plan is to hire the highly skilled manager and offer the performance-based bonus. This will maximize the expected performance of the project."
