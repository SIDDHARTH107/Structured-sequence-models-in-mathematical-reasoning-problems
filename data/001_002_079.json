    "message_2": "To find the slope of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 7), we can use the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere m is the slope, (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the first point, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the second point.\n\nPlugging in the given points, we have:\n\nm = (7 - 3) / (4 - 2)\n\nm = (4) / (2)\n\nm = 2\n\nSo, the slope of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 7) is 2."
